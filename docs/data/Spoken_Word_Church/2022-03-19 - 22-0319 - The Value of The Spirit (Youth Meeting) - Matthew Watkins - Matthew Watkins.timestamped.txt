[21:15] it's the boys most of the time that
[21:16] gives you the problems you know amen
[21:19] and the man said and the women said amen

[24:37] text here
[24:38] can i move this to the side by the way
[24:40] or just move it just up that's all right
[24:43] all right judges chapter 13 amen we
[24:45] bring greetings from south carolina and
[24:48] uh from my father brother jason watkins
[24:52] pastor there and and uh bring greetings
[24:54] from the church there
[24:56] and i'm just grateful to speak to you to
[24:58] the young people here tonight good to
[25:00] see all of you um that have came i don't
[25:03] know if you're just all from here or
[25:04] maybe different places i know we got to
[25:06] see a lot of the youth here at our youth
[25:09] camp how many was at our youth camp
[25:11] there in south carolina good got a big
[25:13] number of you amen well we certainly had
[25:16] a good time and i just trust that
[25:18] there's still something burning in your
[25:20] heart amen from what the lord has done
[25:22] you've continued to let whatever god did
[25:24] for you grow in your life
[25:26] amen it doesn't mean between then and
[25:28] now that you haven't made any mistakes
[25:30] or you haven't fallen or maybe you feel
[25:32] backwards or you've went the other way
[25:34] amen but you know what the lord jesus is
[25:36] mindful of you tonight he's mindful of
[25:39] each and every single one of your needs
[25:40] and and i believe that today is not just
[25:43] brother wade said you do this every i
[25:44] think every other month and but tonight
[25:48] is not just another every other month
[25:49] service but we're in the presence of the
[25:52] lord and so anything is possible and god
[25:55] knows god knows why you came he knows
[25:58] the motive i don't know
[25:59] i don't even know most of you god knows
[26:02] the motive and the intention of your
[26:03] heart he knows why you're gathered here
[26:05] he knows what thoughts are going through
[26:07] your mind right now
[26:08] and so i just invite you to center your
[26:10] mind and focus your attention on what
[26:12] the lord has and say lord would you come
[26:15] and specifically speak to me
[26:18] amen and to my situation how many could
[26:20] raise a hand and say lord i have a need
[26:22] upon my heart i want you to come and
[26:24] meet that expectation remember louise
[26:26] good to see you there i see you there in
[26:28] the back amen god bless you
[26:30] judges chapter 13 we just want to go
[26:33] straight to the word
[26:35] and let us have something upon my heart
[26:37] praying knowing leading up to this
[26:39] meeting that would come i've just been
[26:41] praying and asked the lord what
[26:42] direction it had me go and i was just in
[26:44] many different
[26:45] directions but the lord has just brought
[26:47] our thoughts to judges and i'd just like
[26:50] to minister this tonight to the youth
[26:53] and to all those that are here and then
[26:55] um and then tomorrow lord willem will
[26:58] just continue in that same amen thought
[27:00] brother bob good to see you also all the
[27:02] ministers and different ones here amen
[27:04] familiar faces i believe that uh i'm
[27:07] thankful for this church thankful for
[27:09] the lighthouse that it's been for many
[27:11] years and the ministries and the
[27:13] teaching gifts and and so i'm not a
[27:15] teacher like brother wade um i'm an
[27:18] evangelist and i've got i've actually
[27:20] got a card in my wallet and i've got a
[27:22] license to prove it and so i brought my
[27:25] evangelistic my evangelist card tonight
[27:27] and so um that's what we're going to do
[27:29] we're going to preach the word amen i
[27:31] believe that there's power
[27:33] in the presence of god and when jesus is
[27:36] near
[27:37] satan will fight you the hardest to keep
[27:39] your attention and focused on the word
[27:41] of god when jesus is the closest satan
[27:43] fights the hardest
[27:45] and so i believe that if what we have to
[27:47] say to you tonight is truth and it can
[27:49] bring freedom then you just push back
[27:51] every spirit say lord drive back any
[27:53] spirit of unbelief or doubt or curiosity
[27:56] or attention whatever it is i have my
[27:58] mind on let me center on what you want
[28:00] to say tonight amen i'd like to speak to
[28:03] you on the value of the spirit the value
[28:08] of the spirit and the children of israel
[28:10] let's just begin reading here at verse
[28:12] uh let's just begin actually reading at
[28:13] verse 3 and judges 13
[28:16] and the angel of the lord appeared unto
[28:18] the woman
[28:20] and said unto her behold now thou art
[28:22] barren now she was a type of israel
[28:26] israel was quite barren quite backslid
[28:29] in the book of judges we find that
[28:31] there's an entire generation that raises
[28:33] up that doesn't know the lord
[28:35] like their fathers and the god of their
[28:37] fathers and so god the bible says raised
[28:40] up judges
[28:41] to to deliver the people and so
[28:44] she's a type of of the condition of all
[28:48] of israel that she's bearing and there's
[28:49] no fruit coming from her life
[28:51] but he says here in verse three behold
[28:53] now there are buried embarrassed not but
[28:55] thou shalt conceive and bear a son
[28:58] now therefore beware i pray thee and
[29:00] drink not wine nor strong drink and eat
[29:03] not any unclean thing for lo
[29:06] thou shall conceive and bear a son
[29:09] and no razor
[29:11] shall notice this now no razor shall
[29:13] come on his head for the child shall be
[29:16] a nazarite unto god
[29:18] from the womb
[29:22] now that he's not even born yet
[29:24] he's not breathed his first breath but
[29:26] already there's a purpose
[29:29] that that is working in samson's life
[29:33] before he even comes to the world
[29:37] there's already a purpose there's
[29:39] already a plan
[29:40] there's already a blueprint young people
[29:42] there's already before you came here in
[29:44] 2022 and we're here in march and there's
[29:46] a lot happening in your life there's a
[29:48] lot happening locally a lot maybe in
[29:50] your church maybe in the world and the
[29:52] entire grand scheme of things but let me
[29:55] just tell you this don't ever lose sight
[29:57] of the fact that before you were even
[29:59] born
[30:00] god already had a purpose a design
[30:05] for your specific life
[30:08] but just like god had a lot god had a
[30:10] plan satan also has a plan and the
[30:12] purpose for your life
[30:14] and so notice here even before he
[30:16] breathes before he comes god's already
[30:18] said he's going to be a nazarite
[30:20] unto god from the womb and he shall
[30:23] begin to deliver israel out of the hand
[30:25] of the philistines then the woman came
[30:27] and told her husband saying a man of god
[30:29] came unto me as countenance was like the
[30:31] countenance of an angel very terrible
[30:32] means very awesome but i asked him not
[30:35] whence he was neither told me his name
[30:38] and he said behold thou shalt conceive
[30:40] bear a son and she repeats what the
[30:42] angel has said but notice what she says
[30:44] here for the child shall be a nazarite
[30:47] to god from the womb
[30:50] to the day of his death
[30:53] so in other words no matter this is
[30:55] before samson made a wrong choice or the
[30:57] right choice
[30:58] and god said this is this is what i'm
[31:01] going to have a purpose upon the life of
[31:03] this man and no matter where he goes or
[31:06] what he does that purpose will follow
[31:08] him from the first breath unto the last
[31:11] breath
[31:12] now that does not mean that samson will
[31:14] ever fall into the purpose or the will
[31:16] of god for his life he may never yield
[31:19] to that and we find out ultimately his
[31:21] life never really yields the saddest
[31:24] part of samson the saddest part of the
[31:26] story of samson is not a man who we find
[31:29] bound and blind led by a child but the
[31:31] the saddest part of samson's life was
[31:34] that it was a life that god had purposed
[31:36] but he never realized
[31:39] the purpose that god had for him
[31:43] he says here and he shall be unto the
[31:44] day of his death then manoah treated the
[31:47] lord lord let the man of god restored
[31:48] and sin come again and teach us now
[31:50] let's move on just a little bit past
[31:52] this and god hearken unto the voice of
[31:54] manila verse 9 and the angel of god came
[31:56] again to the woman and she sat on the
[31:57] field but manoa her husband was not
[32:00] with her let's just move on to verse 1
[32:03] of chapter 14. let's just look over so
[32:05] that we can save some time
[32:07] verse 1 of chapter 14 and samson went
[32:09] down to timnath and saw a woman in
[32:12] timnath of the daughters
[32:15] of the israelites
[32:19] oh sorry did i read that wrong
[32:23] young people did i read that wrong
[32:25] he saw let's read it again maybe y'all
[32:27] blinked and you didn't see that or don't
[32:29] don't let me sneak a fast one on you and
[32:32] samson went down to timnath and saw a
[32:34] woman and timnath of the daughters of
[32:35] the israelites
[32:37] no that's not what it says
[32:39] he saw a woman of the daughters
[32:42] of the philistines
[32:44] and he says and he came up and told his
[32:46] father i have seen a woman at tim method
[32:48] of the daughter philistines now
[32:49] therefore get her for me to wife could
[32:52] you imagine talking to your mom that way
[32:54] young man
[32:55] i like her i want it now get it
[32:59] and he says now therefore get her for me
[33:02] to wipe in his father and his mother
[33:03] said is there never a woman among the
[33:06] daughters of thy brethren among all my
[33:08] people that thou goest to take a wife of
[33:10] the uncircumcised philistine and samson
[33:13] said unto his father get her for me for
[33:15] she pleaseth me
[33:17] well
[33:18] this is what's amazing verse four but
[33:20] his father
[33:22] and his mother
[33:23] knew not
[33:26] that it was of the lord
[33:29] it's amazing
[33:30] how sometimes listen to me parents
[33:32] because i know some of you are here it's
[33:34] amazing how sometimes how we view
[33:36] something so black and white
[33:39] and yet god's maybe looking at it in a
[33:41] different way than what you are
[33:45] his father and mother knew not that it
[33:46] was of the lord that he sought an
[33:48] occasion against the philistines for at
[33:49] that time the philistines had dominion
[33:52] over israel let's just bow our heads
[33:55] amen we'll just have a word of prayer
[33:56] lord jesus we just ask for your divine
[33:59] presence lord to come into this building
[34:02] lord we've already read your word so
[34:04] there's already a blessing that's upon
[34:06] our life just from reading it lord but
[34:08] we believe that preaching of the word
[34:11] drives back evil spirits
[34:13] lord and i pray god that right now you'd
[34:15] come and take the promises that you've
[34:17] given us out of your word make them a
[34:19] living reality into every person that's
[34:21] here lord i humble myself now to your
[34:24] spirit lord not coming with any certain
[34:27] agenda any kind of specific
[34:30] thought lord other than just to be a
[34:31] servant to be used now lord i'll speak
[34:34] to these those that are here i don't
[34:36] know many of them lord but i believe
[34:38] that you do
[34:39] believe that you're here in this
[34:40] building tonight and that you've
[34:42] gathered us here for a special purpose
[34:44] lord i may speak things here and
[34:47] lord and if and if it's just me who
[34:49] speaks father maybe if we were to go six
[34:51] or seven weeks down the road
[34:54] maybe all the young people would even
[34:55] struggle to remember what i spoke on or
[34:57] even the scripture i i took lord for
[35:00] that's the that's the shallowness of the
[35:02] word of man
[35:04] lord but if you would come and speak a
[35:06] word tonight and if your voice would
[35:08] speak to the heart of maybe one maybe
[35:10] two
[35:11] of your people lord then it would have
[35:13] an eternal impact it would never leave
[35:16] not even death could take that away from
[35:18] them so we just raise our hands i raise
[35:20] mine with every person here and a sign
[35:22] of surrender and say lord we surrender
[35:24] to your spirit may you come and take
[35:27] your word lord and break the word of
[35:28] life to your family for i believe that's
[35:31] who i'm speaking to tonight
[35:33] bless us now one and all we ask in jesus
[35:35] christ's name
[35:37] amen you can be seated
[35:48] just keep your bible open there to
[35:51] judges book of judges to stay there in
[35:53] chapter 14.
[35:55] preaching to you on the value
[35:57] of the spirit the value
[36:00] of the spirit
[36:01] it's amazing when you look at life and
[36:03] the bible has a way of making it
[36:06] very 3d you can read the psalms of david
[36:10] and you get more than just the just the
[36:13] uh you know uh uh references to
[36:16] doctrinal things but you get a a real
[36:18] life that you can relate to as a as a
[36:21] real person because david lived a life
[36:23] that was very real and it was no
[36:25] pretense and no facade but he spoke of
[36:29] things that you could really relate to
[36:31] and the bible's filled with characters
[36:33] brother branham said you find you a
[36:35] character in the bible and find someone
[36:37] there and identify yourself there in the
[36:39] word because god's not a respecter of
[36:41] persons can you say amen and so so the
[36:45] the the the scripture david speaks of
[36:47] life as a journey and and the bible
[36:50] types it as a journey and and it's and
[36:52] it's amazing because uh you look through
[36:55] through through the entire uh word of
[36:57] god and what you'll find is is that
[36:59] these were lives of men and you can read
[37:02] some of them very detailed from the time
[37:04] they were young and david is as a young
[37:06] man all the way to the age where he's an
[37:08] aged man as a king and he goes off the
[37:11] scene and then you see his entire all
[37:13] the ebbs and flows of david's life and
[37:16] you read the good times and you could
[37:17] look at the bad times and you could look
[37:20] at the times when maybe david was on
[37:22] fire for the lord and then other times
[37:24] when he's backslidden in his life you
[37:26] find the very same exact thing in the
[37:28] life of solomon the the way that his
[37:30] life began his own son and then the way
[37:33] that it ends is just so very different
[37:36] and the bible's filled with this uh type
[37:38] and this picture and this portrait that
[37:40] it's painting of of life
[37:42] let me just speak to you young people
[37:44] here for a minute and say to you that
[37:46] life your entire life
[37:49] is an array of choices
[37:53] that you make
[37:55] and samson's life was led up of many
[37:57] choices and ultimately where we find
[38:00] samson's life at the very end of it and
[38:02] it ends uh you know what the the some of
[38:04] the latter part of his life goes into
[38:07] disgrace we know that at the very end he
[38:09] destroys more philistines in his death
[38:11] than in his life and god was able to get
[38:14] victory out of it his brother adam
[38:15] preaches once more just once more lord
[38:18] and and he preaches that as a type of
[38:20] the church to say just once more lord i
[38:23] let your spirit come and fill my life
[38:25] and but samson's life ultimately when we
[38:28] find him and he's blind and he's bound
[38:30] and he's shaved his head is shaven
[38:34] samson's life was made up of choices it
[38:36] was an array of decisions
[38:39] and choices that he makes
[38:41] and you know choice is such a very
[38:44] important part or aspect of your life
[38:47] the decisions that you make whether
[38:48] they're big and sometimes you're facing
[38:50] things that are large and some major
[38:53] choices of life and but you know then
[38:55] other times you're making decisions and
[38:57] choices just maybe that would seem
[38:59] insignificant or maybe something that
[39:01] was so small or something just like
[39:04] waking up and going out for the day and
[39:06] what you're going to do for the day and
[39:07] where you're going to go and that what
[39:09] things you're going to look at and what
[39:11] things you're going to read him but let
[39:13] me just say this to you
[39:14] young people ultimately
[39:16] every choice both great and small
[39:19] has some measure of impact or
[39:22] consequence
[39:23] for your life
[39:25] and so choices large and small little
[39:28] things maybe things that we listen to or
[39:31] oh and god has given us the ability to
[39:33] make a choice and you choose things in
[39:36] life and you you may be still living at
[39:38] home under the guidance of your mother
[39:41] and your father and and maybe some of
[39:43] the larger decisions they're making for
[39:45] you right now but even in that stage in
[39:48] that season of life you're making
[39:50] choices even if it's just something as
[39:52] simple as what you believe when you hear
[39:54] the word of god and the choice you make
[39:57] of how you view that or how you're going
[40:00] to apply that to your life
[40:02] i don't care what stage you're at and
[40:03] what age you're at in life you're making
[40:06] decisions in your life that will
[40:08] ultimately impact you where you're going
[40:11] to be
[40:12] in the next five years down the road
[40:14] will be determined by the choices that
[40:16] you make
[40:18] very naturally in your life
[40:22] and you know sometimes serving the lord
[40:24] is is we can make it as some great big
[40:27] ethereal thing that you know and maybe
[40:28] even some great grandeus thing like to
[40:31] really serve the lord is to go overseas
[40:33] somewhere and that's wonderful and
[40:35] that's serving the kingdom of god and
[40:37] you know but we sometimes make it so out
[40:39] of touch that at some great it's got to
[40:41] be some great grandeus thing or uh that
[40:44] serving the lord has always got to be in
[40:45] the supernatural place and always living
[40:48] and dwelling in the fear but let me just
[40:50] tell you sometimes serving the lord and
[40:53] being pleasing to the lord is a very
[40:56] simple
[40:57] natural thing that you do
[41:00] every day of your life
[41:04] and sometimes what what it means to us
[41:07] is choices that we make and decisions
[41:10] that we make that can have a profound
[41:13] impact let me just stop for a minute and
[41:15] say you choose
[41:17] the things that you listen to
[41:19] you choose the things that you watch and
[41:22] the things that entertain you and the
[41:23] things you allow into the gates of your
[41:26] soul and and let me just say this you
[41:29] choose the friends that you have
[41:31] you choose those who you choose to
[41:33] associate with and who you choose to
[41:36] allow yourself to come under the
[41:38] influence of now you you have a choice
[41:40] of where you're going to be employed
[41:42] some of you are so i have a choice
[41:44] whether you're going to have continuing
[41:45] education or what school you're going to
[41:47] go to or what job you're going to take
[41:49] or what vocation in life that you'll
[41:51] choose those are ultimately choices and
[41:54] so you pray about those things and you
[41:56] seek the will of god as sons and
[41:58] daughters of god should do and you say
[41:59] lord i want to be led of your spirit i
[42:01] want the choice that you want for my
[42:04] life because ultimately you know what's
[42:06] best lord and i don't
[42:08] and so you make choices and and you know
[42:11] god has given you the the power of
[42:13] choice and every single one of you have
[42:15] a choice today and you're living a life
[42:18] of choices and ultimately where you end
[42:21] up down the road 20 years or 10 years
[42:24] from now maybe you're not there yet and
[42:26] you can't see the vision of that but you
[42:28] can look at your life now and understand
[42:31] where i'm at today is simply a result of
[42:35] choices that i made yesterday
[42:39] and you've been given the ability of
[42:40] choices even brother branham says that
[42:43] you know that god gives you free moral
[42:45] agency and it gives you the the ability
[42:47] to make a choice uh brother branham
[42:49] talks about in the marriage of the lamb
[42:51] and he says now god couldn't just push
[42:53] you through some kind of a pipe he said
[42:55] if god was to do that there'd be no
[42:57] victory in that there would be no faith
[42:59] in that but he says ultimately to
[43:01] overcome you've got to make a decision
[43:03] you've got to make a choice god isn't
[43:06] going to force you he's not going to
[43:07] press you you're not just going to
[43:09] magically be an unbeliever one day and
[43:11] then a believer by osmosis the other day
[43:14] no it's got to be a choice that you make
[43:17] that transcends your dad and your mom
[43:19] and the church you're in or the family
[43:21] you've been raised in but it comes down
[43:23] to you as an individual to make a choice
[43:27] to say i'm going to choose
[43:30] to live my life for the lord jesus
[43:34] and so in the large grand picture what
[43:36] you see is is that choices both great
[43:38] and small are you what you notice after
[43:41] a while of choices is you can notice
[43:45] what maybe we would call a pattern
[43:49] and you can look at the pattern of
[43:50] someone's life and you notice sort of a
[43:52] certain pattern of choices
[43:54] and they're sort of go you start to
[43:56] notice that through those little small
[43:58] choices you see a pattern and then after
[44:00] you sort of zoom out of the pattern you
[44:03] sort of see a trajectory of a life
[44:06] you can see which way it's going
[44:09] you can see is it going towards the word
[44:11] of the lord is it is it is my life a
[44:14] reflection
[44:15] of of the word of god or is it a
[44:17] reflection of the world ultimately
[44:19] really the mirror of god's word is the
[44:22] only thing that can tell you that
[44:24] and so you notice choices then lead to
[44:27] decisions decisions that lead to habits
[44:30] habits then builds character and as
[44:33] brother brandon preaches in leadership
[44:35] and ultimately that character
[44:37] determines your destiny
[44:42] and where you end up in life
[44:44] you notice a certain ebb and flow
[44:47] a certain trajectory that a life sort of
[44:49] takes
[44:50] and you watch it sort of go a certain
[44:52] way like brother branham said that
[44:53] bullet with those sights if it's just a
[44:55] little bit on the off right here at the
[44:58] at the muzzle he said it may just be a
[45:00] hair off he said but way down range it's
[45:04] going to be feet two or three feet off
[45:06] the target
[45:07] but it started with just your life just
[45:09] becoming unaligned
[45:13] with god's channel and god's purpose for
[45:15] your life
[45:16] you hear young people you're here and
[45:18] hearing me today it's what the lord just
[45:20] laid upon my heart and i believe it's
[45:21] for you you've got to believe that
[45:22] though too
[45:24] and so you ultimately arrive
[45:27] what you notice here is that
[45:29] you can look at your life now and you
[45:32] can understand that you have r you have
[45:34] arrived where you're at
[45:37] 18 19 17 16 13 no matter where you're at
[45:41] in life
[45:42] 30
[45:44] you've ultimately arrived where you're
[45:46] at because of small choices
[45:48] that you made
[45:51] and so even samson's life is a life
[45:54] that's made up of choices and decisions
[45:57] and this is why we we preach so much on
[45:59] this about your your the decision and
[46:02] the choice that you make
[46:04] we we we speak a lot about the things
[46:06] that you ought to to do things you
[46:08] shouldn't watch places you shouldn't go
[46:10] things you shouldn't listen to
[46:12] because ultimately those are influences
[46:15] and those things are made to influence
[46:18] your choices
[46:21] and so you look at this and even
[46:23] samson's life starts out this way as the
[46:25] bible said god anoints his life his life
[46:28] begins here
[46:29] uh in judges chapter 13 as we read it
[46:31] when his mother is visited by this angel
[46:34] and so samson learns this as the bible
[46:37] said if you could put that first slide
[46:39] up on the on the screen on the overhead
[46:41] that i sent the powerpoint did you get
[46:42] that brother you can display that not
[46:45] sure um how they're doing that but
[46:47] that's all right if we didn't uh didn't
[46:49] get it it's just fine did we give me a
[46:50] thumbs up did we get that powerpoint
[46:53] uh or not where we can display it no we
[46:55] didn't so you didn't get it through
[46:56] email that's all right
[46:58] um
[46:59] so notice here
[47:01] i i'm gonna i'm gonna try yeah it looks
[47:04] like i got it uh maybe you can bring a
[47:06] note brother with uh with the right
[47:08] email or where to send that to because
[47:09] it's all right i want to get it up on
[47:10] the screen just felt the lord gave me
[47:13] that so that's okay we'll we'll get it
[47:16] sometimes technology
[47:17] uh fights
[47:19] but uh we'll get the victory you believe
[47:20] that
[47:22] amen you can just enter right there
[47:23] brother louise okay okay
[47:25] uh
[47:26] yeah i don't i don't even know if i
[47:28] think i might may have
[47:31] maybe i can just email it by the louise

[47:35] want to type the email send it send it
[47:37] away i'll attach it once you type it
[47:41] you know the bible says there will be no
[47:43] liars in heaven well there also be no
[47:45] wires in heaven
[47:49] good so i'm just going to put powerpoint
[47:50] here
[47:51] i'll attach this
[47:53] okay okay yeah if you guys just display
[47:55] it there in the back i just sent it to
[47:58] the email so if you don't get it blame
[48:00] brother louise
[48:01] [Laughter]
[48:03] okay
[48:04] okay perfect thank you bro thank you
[48:07] nope that's usbc that's all right
[48:09] i want you to notice this here because
[48:11] it's it's this photo that i had the lord
[48:13] just gave me
[48:14] um
[48:16] okay we're still gonna try that's all
[48:18] right
[48:19] i think that's lightning brother
[48:22] nope nope that's mini display that's all
[48:25] right
[48:26] that's okay
[48:28] i want you to notice this here because
[48:30] i i displayed this and i just emailed it
[48:32] there if they get it if we get it up
[48:34] good don't worry
[48:35] we don't have to have we don't
[48:37] absolutely have to have it so it's fine
[48:38] don't don't struggle
[48:40] but you notice god anoints samson's life
[48:43] even from birth as we read this angel
[48:46] visits manoa
[48:47] and the bible says that god begins to
[48:50] speak of the purpose of this life and he
[48:52] says he's going to be a nazirite unto
[48:54] god and he's going to begin to deliver
[48:57] israel out of the hand of their
[48:59] oppressors and so samson's life
[49:02] is anointed we can say that and we hear
[49:04] this term a lot to be anointed
[49:07] uh with the spirit of god
[49:09] and so we know that samson wasn't filled
[49:12] with the holy ghost as you and i are
[49:15] filled uh
[49:16] by the baptism of the holy ghost in a
[49:18] new birth it wasn't couldn't be a new
[49:20] creature uh because the spirit of god
[49:22] had it been sent yet but i just want you
[49:24] to focus here for a moment he wasn't
[49:27] filled in the in the sense that we are
[49:29] but what's amazing is that samson's life
[49:32] is anointed from the day he breathes his
[49:34] first breath there's already an
[49:37] anointing which means a purpose or a
[49:39] plan
[49:40] that god has for his life
[49:44] uh you notice here this this uh this
[49:46] this word and it's even the word that we
[49:48] use for you read this in the bible and
[49:50] you read that uh you read this about
[49:53] samson you also read this about john uh
[49:56] the the the uh john the baptist that he
[49:58] was filled with the holy ghost from his
[50:00] mother's womb it's very much the same
[50:02] exact way that samson was filled with
[50:05] the holy ghost you read in psalms 55 51
[50:08] where david begins to pray and he says
[50:11] lord take not your holy spirit from me
[50:14] uh don't do he says cast me not away and
[50:17] take not your holy spirit though we know
[50:19] david didn't have the indwelling of the
[50:21] holy ghost but what this was i'm
[50:23] preaching on the value of the spirit
[50:25] this was the spirit of god that was
[50:27] anointing david as a man
[50:30] now this word here for spirit stay with
[50:33] me young people i told you i wasn't
[50:34] going to teach but i just want to bring
[50:36] you bring you something so that you have
[50:38] it uh samson's life is anointed
[50:41] and and and this word uh for spirit is
[50:45] actually the hebrew word
[50:48] ruach
[50:50] thank you brother jcanada gmail.com
[50:53] all right let me get this to you brother
[50:56] amen so we have this
[50:58] i want you all
[51:00] to see this so let me just send it again
[51:02] here it goes
[51:04] amen three strikes were out so we're
[51:06] gonna stop after this
[51:09] okay good praise the lord
[51:11] so we notice this here that this this
[51:14] samson's life is enabled it's anointed
[51:17] from birth god has a purpose he has a
[51:19] plan for his life
[51:21] and so god is going to
[51:23] fill samson with the spirit of god
[51:26] or he's going to fill samson with the
[51:29] breath of god he's going to fill samson
[51:31] with the purpose of god and the bible
[51:33] says he shall deliver begin to deliver
[51:36] israel
[51:38] out of the hands of the philistines so
[51:40] we know that they were under the
[51:42] oppression of the philistines because of
[51:44] their backsliding god actually raised up
[51:46] the philistines to
[51:48] afflict israel and so god would use
[51:51] enemy nations and he would raise up in
[51:54] enemy nations he takes pharaoh and he
[51:56] actually calls him my servant and it
[51:58] wasn't that pharaoh was a servant of the
[52:00] lord but pharaoh was going to be used
[52:02] for the purposes of god uh we can even
[52:04] see brother branham saying putin uh he
[52:07] speaks of russia and he says gotta raise
[52:09] up a wicked nation and he'll use that as
[52:12] a servant one day to judge this nation
[52:16] and so so so so the philistines are used
[52:19] as a tool of judgment upon israel but
[52:23] now israel god is going to raise up a
[52:25] savior because that's what the word
[52:28] judge me
[52:30] now not in the sense of savior like
[52:32] jesus is savior but the word why do we
[52:35] say jesus is my savior because the word
[52:39] savior means deliverer
[52:43] when we say jesus saves what are we
[52:45] saying when someone says in the baptist
[52:47] church they've almost made this a cliche
[52:50] i'm saved are you saved what does it
[52:52] mean to be saved well saved means to be
[52:55] delivered
[52:56] it means i've been delivered from
[52:57] something so samson would deliver them
[53:00] deborah would deliver them barrack would
[53:02] deliver them they would begin to save or
[53:05] deliver the people from their oppressor
[53:08] when we say jesus saved me what do we
[53:10] say him he delivered me from sin
[53:15] and one day i'll really be saved one day
[53:17] i'll be delivered out of this body in
[53:18] this flesh and this world and then i can
[53:21] truly say i'm saved
[53:24] hallelujah and so notice this here if
[53:26] you can just advance to the next slide
[53:28] and go through this just an image the
[53:30] lord gave me and i wanted you just to
[53:31] fix your mind uh on that just for a
[53:34] minute young people if you could look at
[53:35] that as you see this picture of this
[53:37] young man
[53:38] and he's he's making a choice in his
[53:40] life he's got a direction that he's
[53:42] going to go and he can either go left or
[53:45] he can go right we can see just by the
[53:47] image if you can see that that one way
[53:50] is a bright way one way there's light
[53:52] one way there's there's there's a
[53:54] there's a life one way and one way
[53:56] there's the right choice and in the
[53:58] other way there's the wrong choice
[54:01] and there's darkness and there's no
[54:02] brightness there
[54:04] and so he's standing there at the valley
[54:06] of decision
[54:08] trying to make a choice
[54:11] samson's life was made up this way we
[54:13] know that his life was one if you can
[54:15] just advance to the next slide that'd be
[54:18] great
[54:19] uh listen to what listen to what d.l
[54:21] moody says here this is powerful he says
[54:23] you might as well try to hear without
[54:26] ears
[54:28] or breathe
[54:29] without lungs
[54:31] as tried to live a christian life
[54:33] without the spirit of god in your heart
[54:37] powerful
[54:38] you might as well try to breathe without
[54:40] lungs or try to hear without ears as to
[54:43] try and attempt to live a christian life
[54:46] without the spirit of god so notice what
[54:49] samson is filled with as we just go
[54:51] through this and even in genesis 1 2 and
[54:54] it says then the earth was without form
[54:56] and void and and darkness was upon the
[54:58] face of the deep and the spirit of god
[55:02] can you say that with me young people
[55:03] can you say the spirit
[55:06] the spirit so this is the the word ruach
[55:10] i'm gonna go to the next slide here and
[55:12] if you can see this it says it's the
[55:14] it's the word that he's using for the
[55:17] spirit of god which if you see the
[55:19] definition is the breath
[55:21] or the wind
[55:23] the spirit of god
[55:25] this is what it would mean in genesis
[55:27] when he said and the spirit of god moved
[55:30] upon the face of the waters
[55:32] it was the breath of god it was the wind
[55:35] of god
[55:36] this is what it means in genesis 6 when
[55:39] he says and behold
[55:40] i even i do bring a flood of waters upon
[55:43] the earth to destroy all flesh wherein
[55:46] is the breath
[55:48] of life
[55:50] it's the spirit of life
[55:53] it's the ruach of god it was the spirit
[55:56] of god it was the enabling
[55:59] force
[56:02] it's what made samson
[56:04] different
[56:08] are you here
[56:09] it's what separated him
[56:12] this is all that made sampson
[56:14] different he wasn't special
[56:17] in and of himself
[56:19] outside of the anointing or the purpose
[56:24] that god placed upon his life
[56:26] that was the only thing that made samson
[56:28] different from anybody else
[56:31] that's the only thing that made shadrach
[56:34] meshach and abednego come out of the
[56:36] fiery furnace alive
[56:38] and not burn like the rest of the
[56:39] soldiers it's the only thing that
[56:41] visited that allowed daniel to come out
[56:43] of the lion's den alive it's what
[56:45] anointed samson to be able to lift a
[56:49] gate that weighed 2 000 pounds and carry
[56:52] it 30 miles through the city it wasn't
[56:54] that samson was some atlas world man and
[56:57] muscle bound and bodybuilder and he just
[57:00] had all kinds of muscles popping out of
[57:02] his chest no brother branham said he was
[57:04] actually a little scrawny shrimp
[57:08] that's what we used to call people in
[57:10] school we'd want to really be
[57:12] condescending you little shrimp what are
[57:14] you gonna do
[57:15] a little scrawny shrimp you ain't
[57:18] nothing you know brother branham says
[57:20] that's what samson was
[57:23] you see you mean samson wasn't this big
[57:25] old muscle bound just strong no
[57:27] if he was then why would i look at him
[57:30] and say please tell me where in the
[57:33] world
[57:35] do you get your strength from
[57:38] he was a paradox it was a miracle wasn't
[57:41] laying in his body it wasn't in his
[57:43] natural figure it wasn't in his own
[57:46] human ability what made samson different
[57:49] was the breath of god and the spirit of
[57:52] god that anointed his life
[57:57] notice here just go through this in
[57:58] genesis chapter 8 god remembered noah
[58:00] and every living thing and all the
[58:01] cattle was with him in the ark god made
[58:03] a wind this was the ruach this was the
[58:06] breath of god
[58:07] he made a wind to pass over the earth
[58:09] and the waters assuaged numbers 27 let
[58:12] the lord the god of the spirits the
[58:14] ruach the breath said a man over the
[58:16] congregation
[58:17] job says as long as i have life within
[58:20] me the breath the ruach of god
[58:24] in my nostrils the spirit of god has
[58:26] made me the breath
[58:28] of the almighty gives me life and isaiah
[58:30] and the spirit of the lord shall rest
[58:32] upon him the spirit of wisdom this is a
[58:34] prophecy of messiah the spirit of wisdom
[58:37] and understanding the spirit of counsel
[58:39] and might a spirit of knowledge
[58:41] and of the fear of the lord jesus in
[58:43] matthew 3 when he was baptized went
[58:45] straight away out of the water and lo
[58:46] the heavens were open unto him and he
[58:49] saw the spirit of god the ruach the
[58:52] breath the enabler
[58:56] he's seen the spirit of god
[58:59] dwelling
[59:02] descending like a dove
[59:05] and lighting upon him
[59:08] and so we know this the bible speaks of
[59:10] these throughout the entire old
[59:11] testament you find people regular human
[59:16] people that were not any different than
[59:18] any other people in the earth except
[59:21] that god
[59:23] breathed upon them amen
[59:27] so his power this was the enabling force
[59:30] this is what david was so fearful to
[59:32] lose to say don't let your spirit depart
[59:35] from me don't take that anointing that
[59:37] david valued i'm preaching on valuing
[59:40] the spirit david had a value for the
[59:42] spirit of god in his life and so much
[59:45] that he would pray that prayer don't
[59:46] take it from me lord
[59:48] so what what was the spirit of god to do
[59:50] it was to make them what they could not
[59:53] otherwise be
[59:57] i want to take that image of samson out
[59:58] of your mind as some muscle man brother
[1:00:01] ham says just a curly headed shrimp he
[1:00:02] had no ability in his own self but when
[1:00:05] the spirit of the lord came upon him
[1:00:08] mightily
[1:00:09] samson was able to slay thousands of
[1:00:12] philistines
[1:00:16] with the jawbone of a donkey
[1:00:18] how brother matt
[1:00:20] how did samson overcome how could how
[1:00:22] did he have this ability was he some
[1:00:24] kind of special superman or some
[1:00:26] superhero no he was just a normal david
[1:00:29] was just so normal and so ordinary that
[1:00:33] his own father seen no value in his life
[1:00:37] he was so ordinary and so plain maybe so
[1:00:41] weak and just looked like so simple that
[1:00:44] his own father couldn't see the value
[1:00:47] but god looked beyond the simplicity of
[1:00:50] his flesh and his humanity and god seen
[1:00:53] a heart that he could anoint with his
[1:00:55] life and when man see nothing but a
[1:00:58] shrimp and man see nothing but a simple
[1:01:01] man god seen a conqueror
[1:01:06] why
[1:01:07] was david any different no it was that
[1:01:09] the spirit of god could come upon the
[1:01:12] flesh of david and david could have
[1:01:14] faith to say
[1:01:16] this
[1:01:17] philistine i'll cut his head off today
[1:01:22] it was the enabling power to be what
[1:01:24] they couldn't otherwise have been and to
[1:01:27] say what they couldn't have said god
[1:01:29] gave samson the power to kill a lion uh
[1:01:31] to carry a city gate 20 miles away
[1:01:34] thousands of pounds you say brother matt
[1:01:36] when could sampson do that only when the
[1:01:39] spirit
[1:01:40] of god
[1:01:42] dwelled upon him
[1:01:46] even the spirit of prophecy in the man a
[1:01:48] man like ezekiel son of man prophesy
[1:01:51] speaking of these bones he would say he
[1:01:53] would eat god what would god do when he
[1:01:55] took jeremiah a man a normal man when he
[1:01:58] would take men like amos normal men but
[1:02:01] god would literally take his spirit or
[1:02:04] his anointing and he would baptize thy
[1:02:07] human vessel with his life what was the
[1:02:10] purpose for fireworks for show so that
[1:02:14] everyone could applaud no it was so that
[1:02:17] that man could be used as a tool or an
[1:02:20] instrument for the purpose of god
[1:02:24] so why would god anoint samson's life to
[1:02:26] deliver
[1:02:27] his people
[1:02:30] the old testament's filled with this
[1:02:32] with men that could speak
[1:02:34] through their mouth words that they
[1:02:36] otherwise couldn't speak because it
[1:02:38] wasn't their words when you rejected god
[1:02:40] jeremiah you weren't rejecting jeremiah
[1:02:43] because it wasn't his words you were
[1:02:44] rejecting jehovah
[1:02:46] when you hear the words of a prophet
[1:02:48] that god would anoint it wasn't the
[1:02:49] words of a kentucky hillbilly it was the
[1:02:52] mind of christ so when you reject the
[1:02:54] prophet you're not rejecting a man from
[1:02:56] kentucky you're rejecting almighty god
[1:03:00] and so the old testament the bible ends
[1:03:03] with these powerful characters but it
[1:03:05] ends with a promise it's left with two
[1:03:09] simple promises two
[1:03:12] about the spirit and this power that
[1:03:14] enabled this ruach this breath
[1:03:17] and he would breathe upon samson
[1:03:20] he'd breathe his life as the bible says
[1:03:23] adam
[1:03:24] even even the first man as the bible
[1:03:26] says he but yet he had no life so god
[1:03:28] breathed into his nostrils
[1:03:30] the breath of life
[1:03:32] and then adam became a living soul job
[1:03:35] says this the breath of god the very
[1:03:37] wind of god the spirit of god enables me
[1:03:40] to live
[1:03:42] outside of that he's no different than
[1:03:44] any other man
[1:03:46] outside of that he's just like any other
[1:03:48] person say brother matt why is that even
[1:03:50] important why are you partnering
[1:03:51] preaching on that because i'm trying to
[1:03:53] get you to understand young people the
[1:03:56] miracle of samson was not samson the
[1:03:59] miracle of samson's strength was never
[1:04:01] about samson let me just tell you today
[1:04:04] you'll never overcome because you are
[1:04:06] like any other person you can look in
[1:04:09] the mirror and say i'm just like any
[1:04:10] other person it's never about you it was
[1:04:14] never about you it never will be about
[1:04:16] you it's about the spirit of god that
[1:04:19] can come into a vessel of your life and
[1:04:21] you'll conquer the devil when you
[1:04:23] otherwise couldn't you'll give victory
[1:04:25] over the enemy in your body
[1:04:27] when you've failed many times and you've
[1:04:29] tried many times and say i just can't
[1:04:32] overcome it but when the spirit of god
[1:04:34] enters your life
[1:04:37] remember brother branham speaks about
[1:04:38] his own nephew and he's talking about
[1:04:40] the boy that he's got a temper and he
[1:04:42] talks about the mother and the father
[1:04:44] and he's this boy is going to marry this
[1:04:46] girl and he's just so rude and he can't
[1:04:48] say i'm sorry and brother brandon begins
[1:04:50] to talk to the man and he says look at
[1:04:52] you or he talks to the woman says you're
[1:04:54] german and your people they just stare
[1:04:56] at you they don't say anything they
[1:04:57] don't speak to you and he looks at the
[1:04:59] woman he says but you're not that way
[1:05:01] your entire family's that way meaning a
[1:05:03] morning i'd come to his this woman's
[1:05:05] sister and the prophet says i look at
[1:05:07] her and say sure fine morning ma'am
[1:05:09] isn't it he said she'd just stare at me
[1:05:13] brother man said i'd say to her you
[1:05:14] ought to come see us ought to come see
[1:05:16] us someday
[1:05:18] brother adam said she'd just look right
[1:05:19] at me and stare at me just german real
[1:05:21] stoic independent
[1:05:25] and he says all of them's that way
[1:05:27] except that one sister
[1:05:30] except that one woman in the entire
[1:05:32] family and brother adam says look at you
[1:05:35] and and hear the family is trying to
[1:05:37] diagnose what's wrong with my son
[1:05:39] and and and brother brandon says look at
[1:05:41] your life he says he says but you're not
[1:05:43] that way and he's then he points to the
[1:05:44] father of the boy and he says look at
[1:05:47] your family they're all fighters and
[1:05:49] drunks now it's brother branham's own
[1:05:50] family it doesn't tell they don't date
[1:05:51] but it's his own nephew he's speaking to
[1:05:54] and he says look at all of them he said
[1:05:55] they're fighters they're drunks they're
[1:05:57] alcoholics
[1:05:58] and he says they they he says that's
[1:06:00] that's
[1:06:01] what they are they're brawlers and he
[1:06:03] looks into the man and he says
[1:06:05] but you out of your entire family he
[1:06:08] says but yet you're not that way
[1:06:12] and brother man says now what did that
[1:06:14] to you
[1:06:17] and he points to the mom and he says
[1:06:18] what made you different from the rest of
[1:06:20] your sisters he points to the dad what
[1:06:22] made you different he said that's the
[1:06:25] spirit of christ down inside of you
[1:06:28] and he says see
[1:06:29] when you get the indwelling of the
[1:06:31] spirit of god i love how the prophet
[1:06:32] says this he says when you get the holy
[1:06:34] ghost
[1:06:35] it's no longer your people anymore
[1:06:40] it's your christ living down inside of
[1:06:42] you
[1:06:44] you're not subject to your family
[1:06:46] anymore you're subject to a new name and
[1:06:48] a new family
[1:06:51] so the bible would come and sampson was
[1:06:54] no different than anybody else
[1:06:56] except the spirit of god he was no
[1:06:58] different than anybody else
[1:07:02] and you find that out when the spirit of
[1:07:04] god leaves him
[1:07:06] and then he's bound
[1:07:08] and then they poke out his eyes what
[1:07:10] happens the spirit of the lord departs
[1:07:12] from samson's life and he's no different
[1:07:16] than anybody
[1:07:18] so you tell me brother matt what happens
[1:07:20] when you take the spirit of god out of
[1:07:23] our churches
[1:07:24] when you remove the spirit of the lord
[1:07:26] and you turn the message and you turn
[1:07:28] preaching and you just turn it into a
[1:07:30] dress code and you turn it into a book
[1:07:32] of rules and all you do is what you
[1:07:33] don't do and i don't do this and i don't
[1:07:35] do that and i don't do this and i don't
[1:07:37] go here and we don't do this and we
[1:07:38] don't cut our hair and we don't when you
[1:07:40] make it just about mechanics and what
[1:07:42] you're doing and you remove the spirit
[1:07:44] of god you're no different than any
[1:07:47] other church
[1:07:49] you're no different than anybody else
[1:07:55] but when you value the spirit of god
[1:07:57] which is the enabler
[1:08:00] of the word of god
[1:08:02] and jesus the bible tells us there would
[1:08:04] be a promise left that there would come
[1:08:06] a man not like samson who came upon the
[1:08:08] spirit of god would come upon and they
[1:08:10] can leave
[1:08:11] but there would come a man that was so
[1:08:13] full of the breath of god
[1:08:16] he was so anointed
[1:08:18] with the spirit of god that same wind
[1:08:21] that breathed upon david and he would
[1:08:23] say don't let your spirit depart from
[1:08:25] the same wind that breathed upon
[1:08:27] samson there would come a man and the
[1:08:30] old testament prophesies in isaiah that
[1:08:32] the spirit of wisdom and the spirit of
[1:08:34] knowledge and the spirit of
[1:08:36] understanding would rest upon him
[1:08:39] what was jesus he was fully anointed he
[1:08:42] was all that samson was he was all that
[1:08:45] david was he was all that abraham was he
[1:08:49] was all that moses was in one single
[1:08:51] human vessel
[1:08:54] he had all of the gifts of the spirit he
[1:08:56] would have all of the fruits of the
[1:08:58] spirit he would have all of the
[1:08:59] abilities he would have the power of
[1:09:02] creation
[1:09:03] in his
[1:09:04] in his mouth
[1:09:08] the bible says it this way he would have
[1:09:10] the breath of god without
[1:09:13] measure
[1:09:17] without
[1:09:18] limits oh that's so wonderful brother
[1:09:21] matt look at jesus and look at this
[1:09:23] limitless powerful
[1:09:25] but you know what there was a second
[1:09:26] promise
[1:09:28] that after that the spirit of the lord
[1:09:30] would be poured out upon all flesh
[1:09:33] so that one man from one man upon whom
[1:09:36] all the spirit of god dwelled
[1:09:38] there would come many men and many women
[1:09:42] who all had different abilities and
[1:09:44] gifts but the same
[1:09:45] not the same breath
[1:09:47] the bible says that the same power that
[1:09:50] raised jesus from the dead dwells inside
[1:09:53] of you
[1:09:55] what is it brother man it's the enabling
[1:09:57] force it's the enabling power that was
[1:10:00] upon samson's life
[1:10:03] to make him what god intended for him to
[1:10:06] be
[1:10:07] now what god intended and what the devil
[1:10:09] intended was two very different things
[1:10:12] god had a course
[1:10:14] he had a path he had a direction that he
[1:10:17] could go if you could just display that
[1:10:19] powerpoint that image again he had a
[1:10:21] direction he could go samson's life was
[1:10:24] presented with this choice
[1:10:28] an anointing
[1:10:30] you know it's a powerful thing when god
[1:10:32] anoints a life
[1:10:35] it's a powerful thing when the spirit of
[1:10:37] god
[1:10:38] takes control
[1:10:40] of a son of god or a daughter of god
[1:10:43] as brother branham says oh
[1:10:45] the greatest problem down throughout
[1:10:47] history
[1:10:48] for god is to find somebody
[1:10:52] who he could get under his complete
[1:10:54] control
[1:10:55] the great problem all down through the
[1:10:57] history of the church prophet of god
[1:10:58] repeats it six or seven times is to find
[1:11:01] one vessel someone who will totally sell
[1:11:04] out someone who will totally give of
[1:11:06] themselves someone who will completely
[1:11:09] surrender mind body spirit and soul
[1:11:14] and when god can find a vessel a true
[1:11:18] son or daughter of god who he could pour
[1:11:20] out his life
[1:11:22] he could pour out his anointing they
[1:11:24] could be so emptied out and freed out
[1:11:26] and emptied and cleaned out every
[1:11:28] channel in their spirit
[1:11:32] that's when god can use your life
[1:11:36] when you've poured out and you've
[1:11:37] emptied out all of yourself how many
[1:11:39] could say lord let me empty out myself
[1:11:42] let me empty out clean out the channels
[1:11:44] of my mind so that your purpose and your
[1:11:46] spirit and your anointing
[1:11:48] oh if god could get one man brother adam
[1:11:51] says a vegan just get one man
[1:11:53] under his complete
[1:11:55] control
[1:11:57] that's all he needs prophet of god says
[1:12:00] as one man
[1:12:02] one woman i'm gonna speak to the men
[1:12:04] here just for a moment it's just what
[1:12:05] the lord told me to do so
[1:12:07] so you brothers just listen real close
[1:12:09] because this is what the lord inspired
[1:12:10] me to say i'm going to speak to
[1:12:12] everybody but just for a moment if he
[1:12:14] could get one man
[1:12:16] with a purpose you see man is god's key
[1:12:21] to his kingdom
[1:12:22] man men man
[1:12:24] i'm not talking about what the world
[1:12:25] defines as a man they've lost
[1:12:28] the meaning
[1:12:29] of manhood
[1:12:32] brother branham even speaks about that
[1:12:33] in his age he said it almost can't tell
[1:12:35] them apart he said they there's really
[1:12:37] no men that burliness men are so soft
[1:12:39] now
[1:12:40] and he says you almost can't tell a man
[1:12:42] apart from from from anything else and
[1:12:44] boy
[1:12:45] if it was that way then
[1:12:47] my goodness how is it today
[1:12:50] you see a man was god's purpose even in
[1:12:53] the beginning i want you to young people
[1:12:54] keep the screen there if you have your
[1:12:56] bible even if you have to use your phone
[1:12:58] i'm going to give you permission to do
[1:12:59] that look up genesis chapter 1. i want
[1:13:02] you to look at this because i want you
[1:13:03] to read it with me especially you men if
[1:13:05] you don't have a bible or a phone with a
[1:13:06] you could use a bible then use your
[1:13:08] neighbors there i want you to read this
[1:13:10] together
[1:13:11] i believe this is just directly from the
[1:13:12] lord notice this in genesis chapter 1
[1:13:15] verse 26 i'm just hearing the rustling
[1:13:17] of the leaves so i'll just give it just
[1:13:19] a moment for you to find your your spot
[1:13:21] genesis chapter one
[1:13:23] and i want you to read verse 26 with me
[1:13:26] you gotta say amen young people
[1:13:29] all right well wait they didn't say amen
[1:13:30] you got to say amen young people
[1:13:33] amen
[1:13:34] verse 26 and god said notice
[1:13:37] let us make man
[1:13:39] in our image
[1:13:41] after our likeness
[1:13:43] and let them have
[1:13:45] dominion
[1:13:46] that's an important word
[1:13:49] let
[1:13:50] us make
[1:13:51] man
[1:13:53] in our image
[1:13:54] and let them have dominion
[1:13:58] over the fish of the sea and over the
[1:13:59] fowl of the air and over the cattle and
[1:14:01] over all the earth and over every
[1:14:02] creeping thing that creepeth
[1:14:04] upon the earth so god created man
[1:14:08] in his own image
[1:14:09] in the image of god created he him male
[1:14:12] and female created he them god blessed
[1:14:14] them and said unto them be fruitful
[1:14:17] multiply and replenish the earth and
[1:14:19] notice this word and
[1:14:21] subdue it
[1:14:24] take control of it because what you
[1:14:26] don't take control of men
[1:14:29] in your life will become out of control
[1:14:34] but you were created to take dominion
[1:14:37] you were created to subdue
[1:14:40] he says i have dominion over the fish of
[1:14:43] the sea the fowl of the earth and every
[1:14:44] living thing that moveth upon the earth
[1:14:47] so man
[1:14:48] is the key even god starts the home the
[1:14:51] family the marriage
[1:14:53] everything starts with
[1:14:56] men
[1:14:57] finding their proper anointing in their
[1:15:01] life
[1:15:02] say brother about my anointing yes your
[1:15:04] life as a son of god has to be anointed
[1:15:07] for a purpose
[1:15:10] say is there something i'm going to feel
[1:15:11] i'm going to shake no no i'm not talking
[1:15:12] about that type of anointing here i'm
[1:15:15] talking about the design or the
[1:15:17] blueprint that before you were ever born
[1:15:20] or came onto this earth god drew up the
[1:15:22] plans
[1:15:23] then he had him engineered then he
[1:15:25] stamped him with his own approval and
[1:15:27] said i've got a purpose i've got a plan
[1:15:30] i've already got i've already charted
[1:15:31] your course long before you were on this
[1:15:33] earth god already wrote out your entire
[1:15:35] story
[1:15:39] but it will be up to you
[1:15:41] to subdue and have dominion and find
[1:15:44] your place as a son of god
[1:15:47] and let me just say until you do
[1:15:50] it'll never work
[1:15:54] if you're a seed of god and you've got
[1:15:56] the you've gotta you if god has
[1:15:58] predestinated you and you've got a seed
[1:16:00] gene of god down inside your life you
[1:16:02] can run and you can run but it will
[1:16:05] never
[1:16:06] work
[1:16:10] because man is the key
[1:16:13] from the very beginning a man
[1:16:15] under the influence not of drugs
[1:16:18] not the influence of worldly things not
[1:16:20] the influence of sports or video games
[1:16:22] you weren't born to play video games
[1:16:25] that's not your purpose
[1:16:26] your purpose isn't known and and your
[1:16:28] purpose isn't found in some
[1:16:30] twitch uh a career or some streaming
[1:16:33] career that's not your purpose
[1:16:35] that's a perversion of the devil trying
[1:16:38] to take god's plan ball it up and throw
[1:16:41] it out and give you his
[1:16:44] except for the man are you preaching
[1:16:45] against video games no you can take
[1:16:46] anything in your life and maybe it's
[1:16:48] harmless and it's okay for you to do
[1:16:51] recreation whether it's sports whether
[1:16:53] it's a career no matter what it is and
[1:16:55] if satan could do anything he'll take
[1:16:58] that thing that is harmless and unsinful
[1:17:00] and he'll so inundate you and wrap you
[1:17:03] up and bind you with the spirit that's
[1:17:06] upon it
[1:17:07] to where something that maybe wasn't
[1:17:08] sinful now is
[1:17:13] a man under the influence of the holy
[1:17:16] ghost
[1:17:17] when i say influence
[1:17:20] i mean he's under
[1:17:21] the control
[1:17:23] of the mind
[1:17:25] of god
[1:17:28] a man under the control
[1:17:32] of the holy ghost
[1:17:34] he's sowed out
[1:17:35] he's consecrated like samson he's a
[1:17:37] nazirite he speaks of the head of
[1:17:40] consecration he's consecrated to the
[1:17:43] purpose
[1:17:44] that god has placed in his life and let
[1:17:47] me just tell you today when there's a
[1:17:49] man who's a seed of god who has sold out
[1:17:52] his life to the purpose of god and he's
[1:17:54] let not saying he's perfect i'm not
[1:17:56] saying he doesn't make mistakes but he's
[1:17:58] single-minded to say though none go with
[1:18:01] me still i'll follow i've got a purpose
[1:18:04] i've got a direction and it's the word
[1:18:06] of god in my life when god can get a man
[1:18:09] like that he is god's greatest weapon
[1:18:16] he will tear down the kingdom of devils
[1:18:19] he will tear down purposes of satan and
[1:18:22] demonic spirits and influences you say
[1:18:25] brother matt why aren't you preaching on
[1:18:26] the on the women let me tell you what
[1:18:28] brother branham says you be a son of god
[1:18:31] and she'll be a daughter of god she was
[1:18:34] created to be that if a man will just
[1:18:37] find his proper place
[1:18:41] you want to take a home that's going the
[1:18:43] wrong way and children are going the
[1:18:44] wrong way and it looks like the
[1:18:46] trajectory is going the wrong way how do
[1:18:48] you save that home brother matt let a
[1:18:50] son of god
[1:18:51] repent and get under the control of the
[1:18:53] holy spirit and you'll watch a home that
[1:18:55] quickly gets in line
[1:18:59] but watch a man get out of his place and
[1:19:01] get distracted and tangled up and
[1:19:04] entangled in the wrong things and his
[1:19:05] mind isn't single and he's a church but
[1:19:08] he's really not and he's there but he's
[1:19:10] really not and he's got a career and
[1:19:12] maybe a job and he's so focused on what
[1:19:14] the on what the devil wants him to focus
[1:19:16] on and he's missed the anointing god has
[1:19:19] in his life you'll watch a family begin
[1:19:21] to crumble
[1:19:23] because man is not on the top i'm not
[1:19:25] talking about a chauvinist
[1:19:27] man is the foundation of the home where
[1:19:29] is the foundation of the home it's on
[1:19:32] the bottom
[1:19:35] created this this picture in people's
[1:19:37] minds that man is the head of the house
[1:19:39] and we create the head because the head
[1:19:40] is up here
[1:19:41] and we say the man lord's over he's over
[1:19:43] no that's a perversion
[1:19:46] the first man the true man was the
[1:19:48] foundation the house was built upon
[1:19:52] and when a man is in his proper place
[1:19:54] under his anointing how god has made him
[1:19:57] young men when you can find the the
[1:19:59] purpose and consecrate your life to that
[1:20:02] purpose god can use you as one of his
[1:20:05] greatest tools in his toolboxes
[1:20:11] he could take one man
[1:20:13] who's dedicated and sold out to the
[1:20:16] purpose of god and he could take an
[1:20:18] entire maybe an entire youth group and a
[1:20:20] dynamic that's existing in that youth
[1:20:22] group to pull them the wrong way let one
[1:20:25] son of god get the baptism of the holy
[1:20:28] ghost in his heart and come into his
[1:20:30] proper position and he'll tear the
[1:20:32] devil's kingdom down in a church
[1:20:36] oh i want to say lord use me could you
[1:20:38] say that young people just feel the
[1:20:40] anointing of the holy ghost maybe for
[1:20:41] one man they could raise a hand and say
[1:20:43] lord use my life i want to be
[1:20:45] consecrated to your purpose oh lord
[1:20:50] he's god's greatest weapon
[1:20:54] you know who you know the problem though
[1:20:56] is that there's another being
[1:20:59] who knows
[1:21:00] that a man under the inspiration of the
[1:21:02] anointing and control of the holy ghost
[1:21:04] is god's greatest weapon the devil knows
[1:21:06] that also
[1:21:09] man is god's foundation
[1:21:11] so if you break the man you break the
[1:21:13] foundation and what happens when you
[1:21:15] break the foundation the rest of the
[1:21:17] home collapses
[1:21:22] he's the foundation that creates and
[1:21:24] carries the rest of
[1:21:26] the house even when god creates man it's
[1:21:29] a reflection of himself
[1:21:31] when he creates the home it's a
[1:21:32] reflection of his own dominion his own
[1:21:34] dwelling
[1:21:35] even when he creates that the the his
[1:21:38] position is calling he says subdue it
[1:21:41] have dominion over it
[1:21:43] you're to be an administrator a steward
[1:21:47] over the gift that god has placed in
[1:21:49] your life
[1:21:50] remember brother branham says i would
[1:21:51] have served him years ago even in my
[1:21:53] teenage years he said i would have came
[1:21:55] to the lord sooner but a spirit hung
[1:21:57] over me preventing me from doing that
[1:22:01] so let me just say this to you young
[1:22:02] people samson was anointed with a
[1:22:04] purpose before he was ever born
[1:22:08] and though samson never surrendered
[1:22:10] fully to that purpose it was with him
[1:22:13] the entire time
[1:22:14] it never left him
[1:22:17] and the purpose of god abides with your
[1:22:19] life even if a spirit's hanging over you
[1:22:21] today to get you to repel the word of
[1:22:23] god and not fully surrender to the word
[1:22:26] of god
[1:22:27] make no mistake god's purpose is still
[1:22:29] there
[1:22:31] all the time
[1:22:34] this is why paul said in
[1:22:36] galatians 5 i say then
[1:22:38] walk in the spirit
[1:22:41] what's he saying walk in your anointing
[1:22:43] walk in the spirit of god
[1:22:45] and you shall not fulfill the lusts of
[1:22:48] the flesh
[1:22:50] for the flesh lusteth against the spirit
[1:22:52] and the spirit against the flesh
[1:22:55] these are contrary one to the other
[1:23:00] so
[1:23:01] what happens god says i'm going to
[1:23:02] create man look in genesis chapter two
[1:23:04] if you have it there just pull it up
[1:23:06] keep that before before us but i want
[1:23:08] you to use your bible or your phone
[1:23:09] there
[1:23:10] thus saith the heavens and the earth
[1:23:12] this is genesis chapter 2. i'm going to
[1:23:14] read this is going to maybe differ just
[1:23:16] slightly from the new king james but let
[1:23:18] me just read it you read along with me
[1:23:19] verse 1 thus the heavens and the earth
[1:23:21] and all the host of them were finished
[1:23:23] on the seventh day god in his word
[1:23:24] verse 4 this is the history of the
[1:23:27] heavens and the earth when they were
[1:23:28] created in the day the lord god made the
[1:23:29] earth and the heavens before any plan of
[1:23:32] the field was in the earth
[1:23:33] let me just let me move past some of
[1:23:35] this in genesis chapter 2 look at verse
[1:23:36] 15
[1:23:38] then the lord god took the man
[1:23:41] and put him
[1:23:44] then the lord god
[1:23:46] took the man
[1:23:48] who he created
[1:23:51] just like he created the fish just like
[1:23:53] you created the birds
[1:23:55] he creates man in his own image
[1:23:58] and god takes the man
[1:24:01] and god places the man
[1:24:05] in the garden of eden
[1:24:08] when god puts you somewhere it's where
[1:24:11] you're supposed to be
[1:24:16] and when you come out of and you leave
[1:24:18] where god placed you
[1:24:20] it'll never work
[1:24:22] i'm going to keep saying that
[1:24:25] you can try and you could push and you
[1:24:26] could toil and you can sweat but when
[1:24:28] you're outside of where god placed you
[1:24:30] it won't work
[1:24:33] so he puts him in the garden of eden to
[1:24:36] tend and keep it so what was eden you
[1:24:38] say brother man it was just garden don't
[1:24:39] think of a garden eden was a condition
[1:24:42] eden was an atmosphere eden was an
[1:24:44] ecosystem it was a dwelling place it's
[1:24:47] where god placed
[1:24:50] man
[1:24:51] it's how god created him you see
[1:24:54] before god ever created the fish
[1:24:57] he created the atmosphere
[1:25:00] or the ecosphere for that fish to live
[1:25:03] in
[1:25:05] and if the fish lives in the place god
[1:25:08] made him to live the fish can live
[1:25:11] but when you take that fish out of the
[1:25:13] place god was made for it god made for
[1:25:15] him to live what happens to the fish
[1:25:18] when you bring him into your environment
[1:25:20] he's not created for it
[1:25:22] so his gills maybe for a little while
[1:25:24] can breathe and you can see him breathe
[1:25:26] after you catch that fish and he's
[1:25:27] breathing and he's breathing and think
[1:25:29] oh he's fine he's just gonna do good no
[1:25:31] he can't because he wasn't made for that
[1:25:33] atmosphere
[1:25:36] he wasn't made for it maybe temporarily
[1:25:38] he can live in it but after a while
[1:25:41] if he's not made for the atmosphere that
[1:25:43] he's in he'll die
[1:25:46] so eden the pro was what it housed the
[1:25:49] presence of the spirit of god
[1:25:52] and how's the spirit of the lord that's
[1:25:54] where the spirit of god came and the
[1:25:55] cool of the evening what was the spirit
[1:25:58] of god it was the breath of god how does
[1:26:00] man how is adam going to live how is he
[1:26:03] going to function like god made him to
[1:26:05] function as long as adam lives to the
[1:26:08] laws that were created for him adam can
[1:26:11] continue to function how god made him
[1:26:15] and so what is what is the law that god
[1:26:17] made the spirit of the lord
[1:26:19] was adam's lifeline
[1:26:22] the spirit of god
[1:26:25] that would visit adam and eve in the
[1:26:26] call of the evening no
[1:26:28] hallelujah
[1:26:30] you see every time god creates created
[1:26:33] something he first created the
[1:26:35] atmosphere for that something to live in
[1:26:41] before he made the fish as we said he
[1:26:43] made the water the water was created
[1:26:46] for
[1:26:47] the fish
[1:26:51] hello
[1:26:53] before he made plants what did he create
[1:26:55] young people before he ever made the
[1:26:57] first beautiful flower that you can go
[1:26:59] and you could smell and you could enjoy
[1:27:01] and oh it's so girls love it so much and
[1:27:04] you get a girl flowers and all oh just
[1:27:06] so beautiful and they just love them i
[1:27:09] i just have never i like think flowers
[1:27:12] are pretty but boy don't ever give me
[1:27:14] flowers for my birthday i mean i'll try
[1:27:16] to act like i like them try to act like
[1:27:18] i'm happy
[1:27:20] try to put on a show but a girl she
[1:27:21] doesn't have to she just
[1:27:23] oh she smells that aroma it just melts
[1:27:25] her heart
[1:27:29] before you ever smelled that beautiful
[1:27:31] flower and you enjoyed its beauty before
[1:27:34] god ever created the flower he created
[1:27:37] the soil
[1:27:40] and without the soil
[1:27:42] the flower's not beautiful
[1:27:46] before what was it the soil was created
[1:27:49] for the plant not vice versa
[1:27:52] oh before god created the stars what did
[1:27:55] he make the firmament what was the
[1:27:58] purpose of the firmament it was so that
[1:28:00] a star could be a star as long as the
[1:28:03] star dwelled in the firmament it could
[1:28:05] shine like the stars
[1:28:07] as long as the planet as long as the
[1:28:09] flower i hope so bad you're catching me
[1:28:12] young people as long as the flower
[1:28:15] stayed in the soil
[1:28:18] it could be a beautiful perv it could
[1:28:19] fulfill the purpose of god for its life
[1:28:22] but what happens when you take that
[1:28:24] flower and you pull it out of the soil
[1:28:26] you might put it in a pretty little
[1:28:28] clear vase and pour water in there and
[1:28:30] you put it in front of your window for
[1:28:31] some sunlight
[1:28:33] and you try and you try and you water it
[1:28:35] and you water it you give it enough sun
[1:28:37] how many sisters can testify just after
[1:28:39] a while
[1:28:40] suddenly that flower will start to lower
[1:28:42] its leaves
[1:28:44] then little petals will fall off it'll
[1:28:46] eventually die you know why
[1:28:48] because though you try to make it live
[1:28:51] in an atmosphere it wasn't created for
[1:28:54] it can never live
[1:28:59] you might love that you you might take
[1:29:01] it and take it out of the ground and oh
[1:29:03] i could just admire it and it's but god
[1:29:05] created the soil because he he he
[1:29:08] creates the atmosphere because in a hope
[1:29:12] so bad you see this
[1:29:14] it's the atmosphere or the condition or
[1:29:17] the soil
[1:29:18] that allows it to function how it was
[1:29:21] created to function but when you remove
[1:29:24] the fish from the water
[1:29:28] it can no longer function as it was
[1:29:30] created to function
[1:29:32] the fish has to have the water
[1:29:36] the plant has to have the soil what
[1:29:39] happens to the star when you take it out
[1:29:42] of the firmament it becomes a falling
[1:29:44] star
[1:29:45] and something that was meant for you to
[1:29:48] get you get get uh you can sit there and
[1:29:50] gaze at it and enjoy it now becomes
[1:29:52] destructive
[1:29:55] and just like the fish needs the water
[1:29:58] you need the spirit of god
[1:30:01] because man was created
[1:30:03] for the spirit of god to dwell inside
[1:30:06] into tabernacle
[1:30:09] you take a fish out of the water he dies
[1:30:11] you take a flower out of the ground it
[1:30:13] dies it withers you take a star it
[1:30:15] becomes a falling star a meteor and it
[1:30:18] actually destroys itself
[1:30:22] begins to break up
[1:30:24] and when you take a man who is created
[1:30:26] to be subjected to the holy spirit and
[1:30:29] under the control of the anointing of
[1:30:31] god in his life and when you remove him
[1:30:33] out of that purpose and out of that
[1:30:35] spirit he destroys
[1:30:38] himself
[1:30:41] and a man who was created to be the
[1:30:43] greatest weapon becomes the greatest
[1:30:45] tool for the devil
[1:30:47] he watched men and and who who lived
[1:30:49] outside of the condition that god
[1:30:51] created for them take up son of god
[1:30:53] remove him from the presence of god put
[1:30:56] something in his life that bega he
[1:30:57] begins to lust after and begins to chase
[1:30:59] after that man that was created to be a
[1:31:02] healer will become a destroyer
[1:31:05] he'll destroy children he'll destroy
[1:31:06] wives he'll destroy the atmosphere of
[1:31:08] the home he'll
[1:31:10] self-destruct
[1:31:11] right
[1:31:13] why brother matt because he wasn't made
[1:31:16] to live there
[1:31:19] and let me just stop here for a moment
[1:31:21] young people there are people in this
[1:31:23] world the bible calls them the children
[1:31:25] of disobedience
[1:31:26] the children of darkness and another
[1:31:28] place it calls them and this is satan's
[1:31:30] eden and there's certain conditions
[1:31:32] there are certain things that water
[1:31:34] satan's eden there's certain things that
[1:31:36] give it light and give it life and
[1:31:38] there's certain people who can live in
[1:31:40] satan's eden and they can feed on
[1:31:42] satan's eat him and they can drink from
[1:31:44] satan's eaten and they'll be just fine
[1:31:46] but if you're a son of god you may try
[1:31:49] to fit in you may try to force yourself
[1:31:51] through but you'll never fit in this
[1:31:54] eden because you weren't created for it
[1:31:56] you'll always be out of place you'll
[1:31:58] always be an oddball
[1:32:02] because you weren't created
[1:32:04] for satan's eden
[1:32:08] and it will never work
[1:32:13] i'm trying and you can try all you want
[1:32:15] and try to look cool and try to fit in
[1:32:17] with that crowd at school and try to fit
[1:32:19] in and do the right things and try to
[1:32:20] say the right things but listen you'll
[1:32:22] never
[1:32:24] fit it'll never work
[1:32:29] you say brother matt what'll happen if
[1:32:30] you don't yield and surrender through
[1:32:32] the presence of god you'll destroy
[1:32:35] yourself
[1:32:37] just like samson destroyed himself
[1:32:40] because he tried to live
[1:32:43] in an atmosphere he was never created to
[1:32:45] live in
[1:32:50] are you here
[1:32:51] can we go just a little bit further
[1:32:57] samson's
[1:32:58] anointed from birth
[1:33:01] very special the bible says he'll begin
[1:33:03] to deliver israel
[1:33:06] it was something he was born with
[1:33:08] something that would enable as we set
[1:33:10] his life but what happens
[1:33:12] he said for the man it's so beautiful
[1:33:14] god uses him he's born under a nazarite
[1:33:17] vow god uses him
[1:33:19] to defeat the enemy you can read the
[1:33:21] victories of samson the thousands of
[1:33:23] philistines he he kills you could read
[1:33:25] when the spirit of god came upon him
[1:33:27] mightily and powerful things took place
[1:33:29] in samson's life
[1:33:31] now god visits manoa and tells him
[1:33:34] you're barren i'm going to deliver you
[1:33:35] through your bareness you'll conceive
[1:33:36] and tells her don't drink anything
[1:33:38] strong don't eat any unclean thing
[1:33:41] because this deliver is going to be
[1:33:43] built with a purpose
[1:33:45] in other words
[1:33:48] in other words god is telling his mother
[1:33:51] and his father
[1:33:52] i've drawn the blueprints up for samson
[1:33:57] i've already i've already constructed
[1:34:00] them and as an architect will go through
[1:34:02] and he starts he's not aimlessly an
[1:34:04] architect doesn't just start and sort of
[1:34:06] meander and just you know i think maybe
[1:34:09] i'll put this here now no he's already
[1:34:11] got a vision before he takes his pin and
[1:34:14] starts drawing he's already got
[1:34:15] something in his mind
[1:34:17] and then he begins to draw those prints
[1:34:21] then he engineers them to make sure
[1:34:22] they're going to stand
[1:34:24] and make sure they're going to stand up
[1:34:26] to the tests and the trials and the
[1:34:28] storms
[1:34:29] and the difficulties that it'll face
[1:34:33] and long before god gone before the
[1:34:36] builder ever takes the first piece of
[1:34:38] wood and the first nail and hammers it
[1:34:40] there's already been an architect who's
[1:34:42] already designed it there's already been
[1:34:44] an engineer that says if you build it
[1:34:46] according to the prince
[1:34:49] if you build it according to how i've
[1:34:51] engineered it it'll withstand every
[1:34:53] storm and it will withstand every wind
[1:34:55] it'll withstand everything that the
[1:34:56] devil wants to throw its way because
[1:34:58] i've already engineered its life and
[1:35:00] listen to me family of god are you there
[1:35:03] in this church here tonight long before
[1:35:05] your trial or your test or your wind or
[1:35:08] your storm ever came god already
[1:35:10] engineered you to be able to stand
[1:35:13] in the day of eve in the evil day he
[1:35:16] already anointed your life
[1:35:19] that means there's nothing the devil can
[1:35:22] throw at you to knock you out
[1:35:26] but god's already anointed samson's life
[1:35:29] i've already drawn it in fact i've
[1:35:30] already charted
[1:35:32] his course
[1:35:34] samson's life
[1:35:36] it's already charted
[1:35:38] i've already written the story
[1:35:43] got a plan a call and an anointing i've
[1:35:46] seen it from the beginning
[1:35:48] you say brother matt does god really
[1:35:50] call my life that way jeremiah some of
[1:35:53] your favorite scriptures in chapter 29
[1:35:55] verse 11 i know
[1:35:57] the plans
[1:36:00] thou has for me
[1:36:04] jeremiah begins to say the lord speaking
[1:36:06] and says i know the plans
[1:36:08] i know the thoughts
[1:36:13] i know the thoughts that i think towards
[1:36:15] you
[1:36:16] saith the lord thoughts of peace
[1:36:20] not of evil
[1:36:21] to give you an expected
[1:36:24] end
[1:36:26] what is god saying in this verse of
[1:36:27] jeremiah your end is already determined
[1:36:30] god's already thought david says you've
[1:36:32] numbered my days
[1:36:34] you know the beginning you know the
[1:36:36] middle you know the end you know the
[1:36:37] teenage years you know the adolescent
[1:36:39] years you know my first my whatever i'm
[1:36:42] gonna face lord you've already drawn
[1:36:43] them out you've already charted them
[1:36:45] you've already given it away you've
[1:36:46] already engineered them you've already
[1:36:48] planned them
[1:36:50] the bible said he's planned the life
[1:36:53] of every individual he's given the life
[1:36:55] your life has specific instructions
[1:37:00] and if you don't obey the instructions
[1:37:03] it'll never work
[1:37:07] so what we find is here that every life
[1:37:10] has a purpose
[1:37:12] even pharaoh
[1:37:13] the bible says was raised up and born
[1:37:17] into the world for a purpose
[1:37:20] can you say amen tonight even judas was
[1:37:23] born in the earth with a certain
[1:37:25] specific calling and anointing and plan
[1:37:28] and instructions in his life even
[1:37:30] pharaoh was given judas was given oh but
[1:37:33] let me remind the devil god also
[1:37:35] specifically designed my life god also
[1:37:38] raised me up for a purpose and it's not
[1:37:41] to be a pharaoh and it's not to be a
[1:37:43] judas you've got to believe that young
[1:37:45] person i was not made and born into this
[1:37:47] world to be a judas but i was born to
[1:37:50] cut the devil's head off i was raised up
[1:37:53] in this ladies in church age to destroy
[1:37:56] the kingdom of satan
[1:38:00] i've got a purpose in this age
[1:38:04] see oh that's so wonderful brother matt
[1:38:06] such good preaching oh my god's already
[1:38:08] planned it he's already instructed it
[1:38:09] he's already blueprints there's already
[1:38:11] an architect an engineer he's already
[1:38:13] charted my course
[1:38:15] how wonderful now let me just put my
[1:38:17] life on cruise control
[1:38:19] it don't work that way
[1:38:20] you see because in the middle of all of
[1:38:22] god's planning for samson's life there
[1:38:24] was one thing
[1:38:26] called free
[1:38:28] moral
[1:38:29] agency
[1:38:34] and samson was a man who was also made
[1:38:36] up of memory
[1:38:38] conscience
[1:38:39] reasoning
[1:38:41] imagination
[1:38:42] affection
[1:38:44] all the gates of his spirit and the
[1:38:46] gates of his eyes and the gates of his
[1:38:48] mouth
[1:38:50] god had all this purpose and all this
[1:38:51] plan and all of this planning and all
[1:38:53] this forethought
[1:38:58] but you see the cost of the choice
[1:39:02] something may be so small
[1:39:04] that has big
[1:39:06] consequences
[1:39:09] samson saw a woman of timnath of the
[1:39:11] daughter of the philistines why why
[1:39:13] samson god didn't choose your wife to be
[1:39:16] a philistine
[1:39:17] let me just say this young people your
[1:39:19] soul mate does not wait in some church
[1:39:21] down the road that doesn't believe what
[1:39:22] you believe
[1:39:23] your soulmate does not way to some
[1:39:25] unconverted person that you're going to
[1:39:27] lead to the message and lead to the
[1:39:28] truth your your your soul mate who god
[1:39:31] has for you does not live outside of
[1:39:34] this message
[1:39:35] but god has ordained you let me just
[1:39:38] stop here for a minute because i believe
[1:39:40] the holy spirit's telling me to say this
[1:39:41] so i'm just going to say it god has
[1:39:43] ordained a specific path and a plan but
[1:39:46] you have a choice
[1:39:47] to either take that way or take another
[1:39:49] one and destroy your life
[1:39:54] and she doesn't live he doesn't live
[1:39:56] oh i'm just gonna i'll just lead them to
[1:39:58] the lord i need i love how brother burly
[1:40:00] williams i think it was brother burley
[1:40:02] who said it
[1:40:04] if you can get them in with a hot dog
[1:40:06] someone will get them out with a
[1:40:07] hamburger
[1:40:10] you might be able to persuade them in
[1:40:12] but if they're not rev if it's not
[1:40:13] revealed to them and they're not born
[1:40:16] into it
[1:40:17] it might go 10 years might go 20 might
[1:40:19] go 30 but eventually that kingdom will
[1:40:21] come down
[1:40:24] it's the cost of a choice
[1:40:27] he's taking a nazarite vow stay away
[1:40:29] from dead things
[1:40:30] samson was a nazarite john the baptist
[1:40:33] was a nazarite jesus was a nazarite
[1:40:37] but even with that nazarite vow that
[1:40:39] samson takes he makes the wrong choice
[1:40:42] the wrong choice
[1:40:43] his mother and his father say samson
[1:40:46] is there not a daughter of her own
[1:40:47] people that you've got to go into the
[1:40:49] philistines
[1:40:52] you know what was the mom what was the
[1:40:54] dad you know the problem with sampson he
[1:40:56] looks at it and says you know what
[1:40:58] that's just mom what samson
[1:41:00] failed to see
[1:41:02] is that it wasn't just mom
[1:41:05] it wasn't just dad
[1:41:08] but actually manoa
[1:41:10] was a vessel of mercy
[1:41:14] that god had in samson's life
[1:41:16] and that vessel of mercy was there to
[1:41:19] stop samson
[1:41:22] and god has placed vessels of mercy in
[1:41:24] your life young people listen to me
[1:41:25] sisters
[1:41:27] brothers god has placed vessels of mercy
[1:41:30] and if you're not careful you'll do like
[1:41:32] sampson and you'll say oh that's just
[1:41:34] mom
[1:41:36] oh that's just dad of course of course
[1:41:39] dad's gonna say that of course what did
[1:41:41] i expect mom of course samson didn't
[1:41:43] realize it wasn't just mom it wasn't
[1:41:45] just dad
[1:41:46] it was a vessel of mercy that god
[1:41:48] anointed in his life to get him to turn
[1:41:51] around and go the other way
[1:41:54] it was a warning sign
[1:41:56] you know warning signs when you drive
[1:41:58] and you see a flashing yellow light and
[1:42:00] you gotta bear a barricade
[1:42:02] and it says road closed
[1:42:05] road closed flashing do not enter
[1:42:08] how many people would get in their car
[1:42:10] and then the road to the left is open
[1:42:12] but the road to the right says road
[1:42:14] closed do not enter and you just go
[1:42:16] right through the barricade and just
[1:42:18] bust over sandbags and there goes
[1:42:20] barrels flying you go through that
[1:42:21] barricade and it's flashing turn around
[1:42:23] do not enter wrong way
[1:42:27] how many people would get in their car
[1:42:29] and just bust over barricade and bust
[1:42:31] over barricade and bust over barricade
[1:42:33] you say brother man i would never do
[1:42:34] that but how many times in your life
[1:42:36] does god put mothers and fathers and
[1:42:39] pastors and people and friends who try
[1:42:41] to tell you and encourage you
[1:42:44] and you break right over the prayers of
[1:42:46] a mother and right over the
[1:42:47] encouragement of a pastor even of a
[1:42:50] sermon and god puts what are those those
[1:42:52] are warning signs
[1:42:54] those are flashing lights that say turn
[1:42:56] around
[1:42:58] go the other way

[1:43:34] just give me just a minute we'll close
[1:43:39] notice what it says here in verse 4 and
[1:43:41] came to pass afterward verse 6 chapter
[1:43:43] 16 that he loved a woman in the valley
[1:43:45] of sorak whose name was delilah
[1:43:47] and the lord of philistines came up unto
[1:43:49] her and said unto her he enticed him see
[1:43:50] where in his great strength life by what
[1:43:52] means we may prevail against him that we
[1:43:54] may bind him
[1:43:56] this is the devil's purpose
[1:43:58] no matter what he brings into your life
[1:44:00] he has one single purpose
[1:44:04] to wrap you up and bind you
[1:44:07] wrap you and wrap you and wrap you and
[1:44:09] get you deeper and deeper deeper
[1:44:12] to where you're
[1:44:13] you're in his web
[1:44:17] to bind you
[1:44:18] to afflict him
[1:44:20] delilah said in verse six tell me i pray
[1:44:22] where does your great strength lie where
[1:44:24] is wherever thou mightest be bound to
[1:44:25] afflict thee samson said on earth they
[1:44:27] bind me with seven green with that were
[1:44:29] never dried and then shall be weak and
[1:44:30] be as another man a lord of philistines
[1:44:32] brought them up seven green wits which
[1:44:33] has not been dried she bound him with
[1:44:35] him now and her men lying in weight
[1:44:38] abiding in the chamber and she said unto
[1:44:41] him the philistines be upon thee samson
[1:44:45] you notice that in verse nine there were
[1:44:46] men lying in weight
[1:44:50] there were men lying in weight
[1:44:54] and then samson is laying asleep
[1:44:56] and there's men waiting to pounce
[1:44:59] he doesn't know has no idea
[1:45:02] there's their demon spirits waiting just
[1:45:04] for him just for the right moment
[1:45:07] to give entrance
[1:45:09] give me a spot where i can come in
[1:45:13] and then
[1:45:14] the philistines be upon you samson
[1:45:19] notice when it says in verse
[1:45:20] verse verse nine there were men lining
[1:45:22] me wide in the chamber she said the
[1:45:24] philistines be upon them and he broke
[1:45:26] the widths as the thread of a toe is
[1:45:28] broken when it touches the fire so his
[1:45:29] strength was not known you know
[1:45:31] it never says that those men who were
[1:45:33] lying in way ever busted through the
[1:45:35] doors when she said that
[1:45:37] the philistines be upon them they never
[1:45:38] came out
[1:45:39] you know what they were doing they were
[1:45:40] waiting to see
[1:45:43] but they were still there lingering
[1:45:46] just for the right moment in the right
[1:45:48] time
[1:45:50] and then stella says you've lied to me
[1:45:52] you've mocked me you've told me lies
[1:45:54] verse 11.
[1:45:55] he said unto her if they'll bind me fast
[1:45:57] with new ropes that never walk by then
[1:45:59] shall be weak and be as another man
[1:46:01] delilah took ropes bound him therewith
[1:46:02] said and then the philistines be upon
[1:46:04] thee samson
[1:46:05] and there were liars there it is again
[1:46:07] there were liars in weight abiding in
[1:46:09] the chamber and he broke them from off
[1:46:10] his arms like a thread
[1:46:12] they never came out
[1:46:15] they never attacked you know that's the
[1:46:17] deceitfulness of sin
[1:46:20] that just because your life seems to be
[1:46:22] going good and everything's fine and
[1:46:25] you're doing the wrong thing making the
[1:46:26] wrong chase choices sneaking behind mom
[1:46:28] sticking behind dad
[1:46:30] you got a separate life that you live oh
[1:46:31] it's just fine
[1:46:32] there's liars and weight waiting
[1:46:35] you may not see them
[1:46:41] and he broke them from his arms
[1:46:43] she says in 13 you've told me lies
[1:46:45] tell me where thou mightest be bound he
[1:46:47] said in there if they we if they weave
[1:46:48] us to seven locks you notice notice
[1:46:50] what's happening it's getting closer
[1:46:52] started here in his hands then it goes
[1:46:54] to his arms then now it's moving up
[1:46:56] closer
[1:46:57] closer now it's in his hair
[1:47:00] it's getting closer
[1:47:02] and she said he said uh if verse 12
[1:47:06] and there were liars in white verse 13
[1:47:08] delilah said in the sims and he gave
[1:47:09] mock me and he says set in there if thou
[1:47:11] weavest the seven locks on my head with
[1:47:13] the web and she fastened them with the
[1:47:14] pen and set of the philistines be upon
[1:47:15] the samson they woke out of sleep went
[1:47:17] away with the pen and the beam and with
[1:47:18] the web and she said how can thou say i
[1:47:20] love thee when that heart is not with me
[1:47:22] that was mock me these three times and
[1:47:23] has not told me where in that great
[1:47:24] strength lion came to pass when she
[1:47:26] pressed him daily
[1:47:31] when she pressed
[1:47:32] him
[1:47:34] daily when the devil's after you
[1:47:38] he presses you
[1:47:40] daily
[1:47:41] and in our generation it's hourly
[1:47:44] it's every minute
[1:47:46] in fact while you've been sitting here
[1:47:47] in church there's been notifications
[1:47:49] popping up on your phone incessant
[1:47:51] notified notified notified notified look
[1:47:53] look look you're missing it you're
[1:47:54] missing it you're missing it if there
[1:47:56] was ever an age that tries to suppress
[1:47:58] the voice of god in your life it's now
[1:48:02] and satan will press you and press you
[1:48:04] and press you
[1:48:05] and get you no time if he can do
[1:48:07] anything
[1:48:09] he'll give you no time to contemplate
[1:48:12] and to think
[1:48:13] and to disconnect
[1:48:16] get you to go go go go go go go go go
[1:48:19] next day you got to push on you got to
[1:48:21] move through what's happening tomorrow
[1:48:22] what's gonna what's my life gonna look
[1:48:23] like what's planned and then if satan
[1:48:25] can do anything he'll get you just to
[1:48:26] shh
[1:48:28] tell that voice of god
[1:48:31] quiet
[1:48:33] trying to live my life here
[1:48:38] samson
[1:48:40] she pressed him daily
[1:48:42] with her words
[1:48:44] notice this here in verse 16 and urged
[1:48:46] him
[1:48:47] so that his soul was vexed unto death
[1:48:50] that he told her all his heart
[1:48:54] said there has not come a razor upon my
[1:48:56] head for i have been a nazareth unto god
[1:48:58] from my mother's womb even if i be if i
[1:49:00] be shaven then my strength will go from
[1:49:02] me and i shall become weak and i and be
[1:49:04] like any other man
[1:49:06] when delilah saw that he told her all
[1:49:08] his heart and she sent called now the
[1:49:11] liar's in weight now
[1:49:14] now they bust through the doors
[1:49:21] come up this once for his showed me all
[1:49:22] his heart and the lord of the
[1:49:23] philistines came up under her and
[1:49:24] brought money in her hand she made him
[1:49:25] sleep upon her knees she called for a
[1:49:27] man she caused him to shave off the
[1:49:28] seven locks of his head and she began to
[1:49:30] afflict him that his strength went from
[1:49:31] him she said the philistines
[1:49:34] be upon the samson and he awoke notice
[1:49:37] young people
[1:49:38] he awoke
[1:49:39] out of his sleep and said i'll go out
[1:49:43] as other times before
[1:49:45] as last year at camp and the year before
[1:49:47] the out is going i'll come to the altar
[1:49:49] and once again i'll repent and i'll get
[1:49:51] clean about his way to youth camp and
[1:49:53] surely i can just keep doing these
[1:49:54] things because i'll just go out as other
[1:49:56] times before we'll have another youth
[1:49:57] meeting
[1:49:58] and then i'll get free of it then don't
[1:49:59] talk to me about it now there'll come a
[1:50:01] day in my life when don't worry i'll
[1:50:03] eventually surrender
[1:50:06] i'll go out as other times and shake
[1:50:08] myself
[1:50:10] and he
[1:50:10] whists not that means new
[1:50:13] and he knew not
[1:50:15] that the lord
[1:50:17] was departed
[1:50:22] had no idea
[1:50:25] that's why i said the saddest part of
[1:50:26] the story is not
[1:50:28] us maine of man samson's story is not
[1:50:31] about a strong man it's about a very
[1:50:33] weak man
[1:50:35] it's not about the strength of man it's
[1:50:37] about the weakness
[1:50:39] of man
[1:50:44] samson
[1:50:46] your purpose you had a plan
[1:50:49] you had a blueprint
[1:50:50] god ordained it got anointed it he wrote
[1:50:53] it he drew it
[1:50:55] yet you at every
[1:50:58] point in your life and every time you
[1:50:59] had to make a choice
[1:51:01] you made the wrong one the wrong one the
[1:51:04] wrong one the wrong one
[1:51:06] the wrong one and those choices were
[1:51:08] leading
[1:51:09] leading
[1:51:10] leading
[1:51:11] leading you may have not noticed you
[1:51:12] were moving at all you may not have
[1:51:14] realized that you were going a certain
[1:51:16] direction because i was still coming to
[1:51:17] church i was still there i was still in
[1:51:19] the same home but all the while their
[1:51:21] hearts slowly turning
[1:51:23] turning
[1:51:24] hardening
[1:51:29] you have no idea what's taking place in
[1:51:31] your heart
[1:51:34] you have no idea
[1:51:39] he knew not the lord
[1:51:41] was departed
[1:51:42] verse 21 but the philistines took him
[1:51:44] put out his eyes
[1:51:46] brought him down to gaza
[1:51:48] bound him with fetters of brass
[1:51:50] branham said
[1:51:52] brass represents judgment
[1:51:56] fetters of brass and now samson's bound
[1:51:58] his eyes are out
[1:52:00] you know let me just say something to
[1:52:03] you here tonight
[1:52:04] samson was blind
[1:52:06] long before they put his eyes out
[1:52:11] samson was bound long before they put
[1:52:14] physical chains on him
[1:52:16] you see bondage
[1:52:18] comes in all kinds of forms
[1:52:21] bondage comes in not just physical
[1:52:23] outward manifestations
[1:52:25] sicknesses other than cancer in the
[1:52:27] flesh there's also cancer of the spirit
[1:52:29] and of the soul
[1:52:31] there's also spiritual blindness and
[1:52:33] spiritual deafness and in fact deafness
[1:52:36] and blindness is just a spirit that's
[1:52:38] all it is
[1:52:39] doctors treat the physical but brother
[1:52:41] branham said it's it's a it's a spirit
[1:52:43] deafness is a spirit
[1:52:46] blindness that's why jesus in mark 9
[1:52:48] tells the man who could the the dumb and
[1:52:50] deaf man he says thou
[1:52:52] dumb and deaf spirit come out of the man
[1:52:55] and i command you not to enter him again
[1:52:57] it wasn't the disease it was a spirit
[1:52:59] that was on him
[1:53:01] and sampson's life has allowed an
[1:53:03] entrance to spirits in his life
[1:53:06] and now he's blind just an outward
[1:53:08] representation of what took place in his
[1:53:10] heart
[1:53:11] he's bound just an outward
[1:53:12] representation of what happened
[1:53:14] what was slowly wrapping him and binding
[1:53:17] him
[1:53:19] and eventually samson's life a life that
[1:53:22] was called for a purpose
[1:53:25] a life that was charted
[1:53:27] a life that had a specific course
[1:53:29] a life that had a moment
[1:53:32] a moment of decision
[1:53:34] a moment of decision where you could go
[1:53:36] left
[1:53:37] or you could go right
[1:53:41] and you know what young people no mom's
[1:53:43] gonna make that choice for you no dad
[1:53:45] can make that choice for you that's
[1:53:47] something that happens right here
[1:53:51] and no no no no nobody as much as we
[1:53:53] wish as much as a parent would wish oh i
[1:53:55] wish so bad i could i could fill them
[1:53:57] with the holy spirit i wish so bad i
[1:53:58] could surrender for them i wish so bad
[1:54:00] lord but you can't
[1:54:04] you've got to make that choice and that
[1:54:05] decision for yourself
[1:54:10] the sadness of this
[1:54:11] was that delilah's name
[1:54:13] even her name
[1:54:16] means
[1:54:17] to slack off did you know that
[1:54:20] that's what delilah's name meant to ease
[1:54:23] up
[1:54:25] her name means
[1:54:27] ease up
[1:54:29] slack off
[1:54:32] lose this is what it means
[1:54:35] because this is what the devil's plan
[1:54:37] was his plan was to rob him and to strip
[1:54:39] him of power
[1:54:41] and strength
[1:54:42] and so her name means to slack up to
[1:54:46] slack off
[1:54:48] to ease up and i love this one to lose
[1:54:52] intensity
[1:54:56] samson starts off strong with life and
[1:54:58] he separated unto god of nazarite and
[1:55:01] then 20 years go by and nothing's talked
[1:55:03] about about samson doing anything for
[1:55:05] the lord doesn't talk about the spirit
[1:55:07] of god moving upon samson's life no more
[1:55:09] mighty victories for israel
[1:55:12] but he grows weary he grows cold he
[1:55:14] grows carnal
[1:55:17] and he's laying in the lap of delilah
[1:55:19] very manifestation of what had happened
[1:55:21] in his life or even her name
[1:55:23] means to lose
[1:55:25] intensity to relax
[1:55:29] just to let off
[1:55:30] to let up
[1:55:33] if there was ever a time i could come
[1:55:35] from south carolina and i could tell you
[1:55:38] young people here in georgia
[1:55:40] if there was ever a time to not lose
[1:55:43] your intensity
[1:55:44] it's right now
[1:55:48] if there was ever a time to wake up
[1:55:51] and shake yourself
[1:55:53] if there was ever a time to surrender
[1:55:55] and say lord
[1:55:57] let me value the spirit of god could you
[1:55:58] bow your heads with me young people
