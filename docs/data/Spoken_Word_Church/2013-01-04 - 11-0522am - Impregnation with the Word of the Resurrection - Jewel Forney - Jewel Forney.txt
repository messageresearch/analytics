here this morning I'm going to go right to the word of God this morning and I'm not going to keep you all day but I'm going to say what I got to say then I'm going to pray right out I'm going to be reading from the book of St John the 11th chapter Romans the 8th chapter this morning but I'm begin reading at St John the 11th chapter St John the 11th chapter this morning and I'll begin reading in verse 21 and it reads like this then said Mara unto Jesus Lord if thou had been here my brother had not died but I know that even now whatever thy will asks of God God will give it thee and Jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again and M and Mara said unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day in other words she asked him if you ask God I know God will give it to you but when she responded she was looking to certain way out here right right and Jesus said Jesus said unto her I am in other words the present Resurrection is walking right now I am the resurrection and the life he that believe in me though he were dead yet shall he live amen and whosoever live and believeth in me shall never die believe it th this Romans 8 Romans the 8th chapter of Romans and I want to read one verse from there Romans the 8th chapter and I want to begin reading it verse 11 it says but if the spirit of him raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you amen he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your moral Body by his spirit that dwelleth in you PR I gracious father one more time help me to you my body to you my mind my spirit oh God help me to surrender all father I trust God that you speak to your peoples this morning heal the sick Lord if any oppression be here Lord cast it down father let your word have prance in this service father God I commit all I got to you now I trust God that you take over and do the preaching in Jesus Christ's name amen May me seated one moment thank the Lord for the reading of the word of God this morning amen and we went back to the scripture here and Marth was a we know the story how that they had sent a message to Jesus and and Jesus did not come before 4 days H in other words Jesus did not get in no haury he did not get he did not get all the out of been out of shap by it he did not let pressure or oppression get in his way H he waited for 4 days before he came down and and visit mon them about about the the message he had got about Lazarus but when Jesus came he had a reason for waiting for days he didn't just in other words it was some reason why Jah did not get there on the third day because Jah knew the traditions of the Jews and he knew that the Jews believe that the spirit of of the spirit linger run the body for 3 days and if jetah would have did it I call they would have say his Spirit was still there but jetah would to 4 days he broke that tradition then he came then he called for the resurrection now they look back to the tradition and say well this Spirit was right in the body no it was the fourth day the spirit already left the body how do so they and Jesus came Jesus came and Jesus said here Jesus called Lazarus out of the Grave Lazarus come forth I knew M was believeing there but M could not believe in a present day Resurrection right I had a title I'm going to take from there this morning impregnation amen with the word of Resurrection Hallelujah in other words if you're going to be raised you got to already be pregnated with it that's right hall everything going in word god a't going to have an unpregnant bride how you say my brother Jew you say you in Word what you trying to say I'm going to say this I said God going to have a bride that going to bring forth h a resurrection that why he takes it back to the Book of Romans and he says here if the Same Spirit had raised Christ from the dead H if you all got that same spirit in you you are pregnated how to take a resurrection if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead if it dwell in you your body Hallelujah H your death in your body hallah cannot hold you back H in other words he if the sa to raise him from the dead if it dwell in you it will quick your Mor body Hallelujah and all death got to turn loose Hall high blood pressure got to turn loose sugar diabetes got to turn Lo how you going to be changed we thank God for that this morning Resurrection the impregnation and resurrection and I begin to took it and I took us off from here because when Jesus coming Jesus is is coming back for one thing he said when I come shall I find faith in the earth fa God something floating right here in the M way in the faith in the earth God himself how see a bride pregnant it with himself the only thing that God respond Faith how without Fai is impossible to please him how so when God come shall I find somebody they can respond back to me come on brother amen amen right Hallelujah now here we find him we going to De talking on impregnation so I'm tell from The Book of Mark and reason I because when Jesus came Hallelujah if we know the story here Mark 11 and I believe it was when Jesus Jesus uh Mark 11 and when Jesus came down here he seen a fig tree right H when Jesus wanted to draw virtal he wanted to the Bible say he was hungry and he wanted to pull Virg from this fig tree H Jesus walking down the road he can see a fall and no doubt he begin to get happy he's oh man is the time I can just get me one of juy fix H and I can and I can and I can pull some scrip from it but the Bible said when Jesus got to the Fig Tree the Fig Tree didn't have no fruit I don't care when God come H he going to be looking for some evidence Hallelujah in other words got to be something that God can identify with when Jesus got to the tree the tree was in the Earth the tree had the Earth the tree had rain the tree had the Sun but it didn't have no fruit Jesus said tree is known by fruit so how can there be a resurrection without the fruit of Resurrection so Jesus himself he came to the tree and he seen the tree with no fruit on it how did Jesus say i c you no man can eat from you from this day part and he went on and he went on up to Jerusalem did what he had to do then the say a few days later they turned back to the train Peter mind was quickened Peter says in him the tree that the master curs on is the W away Hallelujah why did Peter do this what made it come back to Peter because Peter was pregnated with Resurrection it was something in Peter that Peter didn't even know he had he had it in him and it brought it back to his remance he remembered the thought of God and when he remember the thought of God Peter said the tree is C how do God brought it back to remember the same Revelation that told Peter God Christ Living God that's right talking about Resurrection pregnation with Revelation pregnation with Resurrection the word resurrection mean to rise up if you got a revelation if it's not bringing you closer to God of rising you up you got the wrong Revelation because your Revelation is not and know what people say find a lot of people that been in the message and it said and they going backward that Revelation that show that they never got pregnant with the word of God because if you got the resurrection in you you got a power in you so you can rise up you got to keep going forward how got to keep getting you closer to God how people fire here a lot of time they say what I'm predestinated I am predestinated brother I can do what I want to do if you predestinated I you doing what you want to do and you going back toward the world yeah going back to the world then you not showing the fruits of predestination because predestination mean I am predestinated to be conformed into the image of the Living God how my life is not going Bible but my life is rising up how T the image of God because when he he's looking for life that can meet his Revelation and that's by faith right I begin to look at him I'm going to read a quote from the from Christ the mystery God revealed and then kind of braing try to bring they bring a little light on my on the what I'm what I'm speaking on and he says here he says C me God reveal page 67 he said you cannot commit adultery right how do you can not commit adultery you already pregnated right so now he putting it there and what would he doing this he that you cannot commit D you already pregnated Glory he cannot how can he take a hold the wound of life is closed to anything else you already by predestinated that seed has come to life and no world can get in how many people would you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost how pregnated with God he said no world can't get in how you what what I'm going do I've kept it by the I've kept it in this world how do you feel thepress of this world but the world cannot have no influence over your life because you you Lord oh Hallelujah we begin to look here took another one another quot spoke word to see and other words when you pregnant him and he say a woman that's and other when God come he got to find you how he got to find you he got to find this word punctuating through your life or else you not be able to race how not let me use the Rapture message this made the one of need he said Rapture message he say right here he said he said he was using St John the 15th chapter he said in St John the 15th chapter ever never plumed never plume the the the vine out he took the branches off and what he never cut the vine off right he took the branches off right and cut them out because they was not burn any fruit right that's what God is looking for a pregnated bride must have fruit how Jesus did not say you going to be known by by how good you how good you dress how he didn't say you going to be known by how much you run now he tree is known by his fruit all man shall know you that's right amen he says here he going to cut the branches off and cut the branches out of them because they they was he cut the branches cut the branches he no he cut the branches off them because they was not burn any fruit that's and we Jesus Jesus want fruit of Y for him for himself right his wife must bring forth the kind of children that he is and look what he is word right and that then if that does not bring forth he said then if it does not bring forth children bride children word children then then it's the denomination child in other word it's the wrong seed hallah when Adam got to Eve you listen here when Adam got to Eve she was already pregn it with the wrong seed H she already had defiled herself with the wrong seed when God when Joseph got to Mary Mary was already pregnant without see with the right SE with our sensation OHL what we got to get and that's why it is in this message when God come you got to have the right seat in you now the word spok word seat woman that's spouse you a woman just engage to a man yep to find a young clean man and before they come together she is found pregnated by somebody else the then her the her own seed which is betr to her her own body which is she be she betr to her boyfriend or engaged to her husband is found full of seed of another man what a disgrace hallelu when God come he's not looking for a denomination a bride he looking for bride that got the revelation of the word in her and they got power to be changed in a moment of the T the eye here what Jesus said if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead if it's dwelling inside of you it will bring your body ever raise your body to another level amen begin to look at but you know we realize you we Bas as our Revelation in this message as I go around and I see what people put their uh emphasis on they put their emphasis on when I'm in the message oh yeah but the point that I put my emphasis on is the message in you with Fellowship by Redemption he said the branches bear fruit not the vine that's right the branches the vine only the energy in into it right the gospel can be preached by Christ but you open yourself up and be a branch that bear the fruit to bring for fruit right others can see Christ in you by your testimony others can see Christ because the evidence is that Christ in you somebody got to be able to know that you're pregnant right when a woman get pregnant she don't need sooner or later somebody going to know iide her husband in herself and God H and she stay and she stay pregnant it long enough the whole church going to know H it won't be nothing to H on it how you won't have to go and look at her how many mons you get when she get about seven8 month everybody going to know right he the words in the word that's say he testimony by the Life by your life and the way you live he is he is the energy but you show the picture you the walkin Bible right pregnation but we take well brother I've been in the message I've been hearing the message but have you become pregnant see because don't mean because you've been planet or been around the M it mean that you're pregnant I took it from St Matthew 13 yeah look at St Matthew 13 for a minute cuz I want to know I'm I want to know not just because it fell because when the word fall everybody have a Revival the word brings a Revival but all in other word but the rain on the just and but only one seed that's in the ground that's got the fruit in of the right seed ever SE bring for out this so now go in here in in in in the book of St Matthew the 13th chapter I leave Verse 18 it says here he's talking in the parable he said here y therefore the parable of the sword Now watch how he put this when anyone he the what it was not a denomination right it was the people that was following the message but never went all the way amen when anyone hear the word of the Kingdom right and understanding it what that's what I'm going to stop for one second hold your place hold your place cuz I got this in here I've been in this message but I don't understand this message if you can't understand if you can't understand the message you're liking the Holy Ghost because the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth is a understanding of what the word is for your day how how you going to fight the devil and you living on some other manner that fell some other Church how do you got to know your Revelation for your day what is the Revelation for the day that God is going to bring your body subject to the word to change your body only way your body can be changed it got to be subject to the word right just got to be take a word hand to bring your body to your word rev so we begin to look here he says here so anyone that understand the not how when a man don't understand something he's in confusion how do you get lost and you don't understand where you at you go into confusion you know how man is sometime I get lost and my wife you better pull over you better ask somebody and a man only trying to figure it out cuz we hate to stop and we and we don't pass everybody on the road how we done pass every car on the road and to stop and pull over and ask somebody well man how I want to lose 10 minutes oh my and I you know know he he brother say was going to Florida and Mar said hom you need to pull out the map Homer said Marie don't worry I know a shortcut said well hom I think you need to look at the M he said you just go to sleep I know where I'm at so Mar said he said sister went to sleep Hallelujah she woke up she said homie We There Yet homie said no we almost there he you lay back there to go to sleep she went to sleep she looked up again she said oh look at that sign right there that sign is way out of the way home the day with 8 hours out of the way how would happen when you don't understand where you are in the word how you be all way over here lday way over here West today but we got to get back that's right he when you don't understand he says in the 19 when anyone hear the word of go of the kingdom and understand not then come the wicked one and catches away that which was sold in his what in his heart and that is he which receive seed by the ways side then it go to the 20 verse he that hear the word he that receive excuse me yeah he that receiveth the word reing the seed excuse me he that reing the seed into Stony places is the same as he that hear the word hear the word and able with joy and receive it and yet having not what root it fell but it was no root right and if there's no root there's no fruit exactly how going to take because the fruit got to be in the vine the life is in the vine how you show if it falls in the ground how do it got to have something it it got to be in the right type of a revelation he said he have not Ru in himself but endure for what right how many people that been around this message yeah you seen them Rejoice all over the church H then the little trials and little thing begin to creep up may think you know you ain't seen him in two years what it is he heard the word but there was no root to hold it he do it for a while but when tribulation and persecution arises because of the word by and by He Is offended and then he go say he that also receiveth seed among Thorns every one of these Revival had a pregnation every one of the revivals had a seed to fa a word Revival but the point of it was the earth that it fell in was not good ground because if it would have been good ground it would have broke forth but see every one of them had a word Revival and every one of them had something that moved it but the lay see a right here how so the seed fail the word fail for this Edge right this is The Edge that more what is the greatest sin of this age is materialism Hallelujah so he said he receive SE among Thorns is he that hear the word and he that hear the word had ear to hear and the chaos of this world and the deceitfulness of riches everybody want to get rich everywhere you go go every store I go in every every con convenience store I go in uh PP or whatever the name of there H or whatever do people just buying the little tickets oh yeah trying to get rich Hallelujah in other words they spend all their money to win $100 right oh yeah everybody want to get rich so you going to the beach store you have to stand in line for cuz some little old woman taking all her money she should be feeding her babies with time to get rich how mind is all riches yeah come on H paying trying to get rich one preacher in the message I a going to call his name he told this church play the lottery oh my but if you win it pay your ti beside that was a mess with preacher oh I ain't going to call his name I tell you I tell BR down behind but I don't go along with that God don't gambling he come into the church they was gambling he keep over the money table and run them out of the church H God didn't tell them say pay I go out here and shoot Dice and when you win the jackpot pay your time how he kick it over because it was a perverted and you are the Church of the Living God how the church in other God Church act like the world that's right that's right and he said and he said and then the she riches choke the word and he become unfruitful so it's somewhere in the line it was starting to be something taking place but before he had to BR before he could bring forth Christ he had a miscarriage in the word right right and then he said but he that receive SE into good ground good ground how the ground is ready to be planted right now I don't know how to plant I ain't never planted nothing in my life that was Leal I just be stuff I planted was not legal but I never planted the Gard in my whole life my wife she was raised on the farm she knew how to plant she planted all kind of stuff and she told me after she planted she said I want you to go out there pull the grass out of it I said you got to be kidding I said I thought they would they put insects in them for to eat the grass out of it I a quite natur this a go good but if you going to have a way everybody I know that PL anything and my mama was into the little time I run her she was into growing flowers and stuff and she would put and she would take her time to water it she puts different minerals in it and the plants would grow like everything H so in other word so in other words so you got to get the ground prep he that receive SE that the good ground and he that hear the word and understanding it how you got to come to a clear understanding which also which also burn fruit H was not a tree without fruit and other be fruit and bringing forth some 800 some 60 and some 30 it got to be evidence of a pregnation h got to be fruits H you say well brother je I've been in the Mage I didn't done all this I'm pregnant yeah on you know people go through false things that make they pregnant right right right yeah people go through these false things that my wife care yeah I almost slipped well you know when you getting certain she went through a cycle that everything stopped right and the devil start to play with my mind and play with mind hope I ain't pregnant right I'm thinking I hope you ain't need because I know this going to be fad she was pregnant but I know this was going to be rough I think she I don't know what to happen she say things unhappy I just my daughter's calling Mama you need to take a pregnant t i to leave the test alone but I ain't want nothing to weaken my Fai and she pregnant it going to be hard I mean it was going to be hard I trying to think how will I deal with this thing I'm going to have to go get some psychological help I ain't woke up in 27 years and change the paper 27 years and got a B now you talking about get bre no no no baby please Lord don't bless me with that bless me with anything Grant you anything but don't bless me with that brother hom say one thing I love about grandchild you told me this yesterday brother hom he said brother je one thing I love about Grand what he said I love to see the lights coming in my driveway he said but I love better when they see the tail lights going out h words thank God it was a thank God it was just something play with her mind it was something play with my mind I say praise God she wasn't pregnant cuz she been pregnant I'm going to have to go off the field for a few months to get myself together again you people go through this false label right false conception because they in the message they think well all you got to do is B the message you say I you better receive the Holy Ghost exactly and I begin to look here we need to find some false evidence in of a some woman some spiritually speaking he said because a woman typed the church how do we need to find some spiritual evidence of somebody that thought they were pregnant because they seen the signs you know some women they want to be pregnant so bad they take all kind of tests and they feel a few months they'll get all excited I believe I got it just then they take a test and they say no and the body would seem to went through all these cycles and seem to be that way then they go take the test is not nothing H so in word so in word brother you got to take a test it's the word test because that's the only thing that can determine if you pregnant or not hallel in other words you're the word test you don't receive it he know well I come to him and Adam put a seed in e no it ain't that way you got to receive it by the baptism of the Holy Ghost it ain't nobody put a SE in you if you got a SE to you God put it there he born of God cannot commit sin because his SE remain in you so to go here so I begin to looking for evidence of a church that thought they was pregnant yeah and I went over here and I found one in St Matthew the 7th chapter St Matthew the 7th chapter and I begin to look for a woman that had thought they were had they was pregnant a church that thought they had a Revival St Matthew the 7th chap verse 19 and it says every tree that bringeth not forth what good fruit is hang down and cast into the V what about there fruit you should what so now the evidence is by fruit right Hallelujah the evidence is fruit righten then he goes on and says everyone that says unto me Lord Lord shall not enter the kingdom the shall not enter the kingdom of heaven but he that does the will of My Father which is in heaven for many with many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have not we prophesied in thy name and in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful work and I will profess on them I never knew you I never knew you heing me yeah that working a n what was wrong that was no impregnation but that was sign that's right that was signs of pregnation because they seen these things and they begin to look at the sign and not look at the person right what it don't bother me when some man get up and say I believe the world going end because them just signs you got to have evidence of you pregnant all these don't move to R it up how guy come up here and say October he going to do here and going to be a r here I'm not even wor about I thing don't me one bit I the only thing I I see I want to know that Christ is on inside of me something my my to change it do this myself so now we got to find this lady M see what's wrong y on because Jesus says here a tree is known by his fruit right right now we got to find what she's going through these label pains in the scripture right these labor pains these false pains that making her think that she's pregnant right yeah making her she's already to receive the seed of the word we got to find something in here to find out where we at so we don't get to looking at where because I feel like I'm pregnant no you got to know that you're pregnant that's right I Mary knew my Revelation that she was pregnant because words in other words so you got to have a revelation I have got to baptis of the Holy Ghost that mean that no devil hell can take that out of you but I want to look at this false label let's look at false label for a minute I'm going to go to 1 Corinthians 13 let look at this false label for a minute Paul is dealing with a woman a church doesn't Prevail with false lay yeah so Paul got to speak on it right he these says here and he goes on here we looking for fruit now and Jesus says here Paul says here of second First Corinthians say second first yeah 1 Corinthians 13 He said though I speak with Tong to what and angels have not what I am what become as they sound bre we howel Paul said do I speak with Tong of man and Angel going through birth pain how PA say and do I have the gift of what and understand what that's what they get it he yeah but brother I've been in this Mion you can't tell me I understand the whole thing but I can't stand Brother Sam you down he get on my nerve if I okay we'll deal with you in a minute okay cuz your mystery might be in your head you need to get it to drop 18 more understand all mystery and all what and I have all what so that I can do what have not charity I am what I don't care what if there is a false lab how if I I can do all this I have all each side I can have all the mystery but if I ain't got charity I'm not pray come on now this is Bible now you said well I'm going to be a good missionary all right we're going to deal with you then he said don't I be s besid all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burnt and have not charity it what right anywh there's no pregnation how you been going through all the emotions but been C through false labor because you look back you say well I got all these mystery I got all these things right here figured out I got all the faith but I ain't got the thing that I need the most is the love of God hallelujah I can have all this and be nothing right then he go to tell the nature of the pregnation if you notice him Paul goes and breaks down the word charity right because he knew that was a sign of a pregnated Church Hallelujah you said brother Jo you we not here anywhere you say if you go and you follow this pyramid up there as you get to the end of the Holy Ghost the Capstone of Love Got to come down and receive you how do you got to come through that brotherly C in other words get the all go the Capstone of Love Got to come down and receive you how people and you ain't going want to let you know something here you don't get to cap the love when you die you got to have it here exactly I mean come on people we got to realize here I mean I done done it all he all the my it ain't nothing I don't by God grace I'm understanding I don't know all the but there's a lot of things I do understand that I didn't understand 10 years ago I did something a explosion knowledge that increase right there's no sign of pregnation come on the sign of pregnation is the love of God then he says here charity yourself alone mhm that's a baby right something done took place a conception to took place Hall charity s alone that's right charity s alone and charity is what over these snob message bad attitudes sanking temples right all temples everything off I mean I know how this is I had a bad temple one time too I I break up everything in the house right yeah you know man everything I got mad I could control my temper I what that we I put the Comm here H I got so mad H I got so mad I was in the house my wife didn't know she flushed it well if I would have been elected water you would seen fire father out how I come out none of that house I raging M I walk in in I gra that Mo $65 at that time I walk back there in the RO and the devil said you dumy the devil say you dummy so I had to go back and buy n it's an extra $65 so you know in other words these things got to come under control right right so then he said and know and J I'm not going to read all this today Char alone and J and charity alone charity is kind charity in not and go on and on he go down through the level of Charity if you read the rest of the scripture I'm to do the same you will find out the nature of Charity he will try to show you what why because Jesus said You shall know them when men have loveed one for another you shall know what seed is it is right that's right right brother now I need to find a Vindication a pregnation I need to find in the message what will I be looking for if I got a v if I'm pregnant How Will I Know It didn't the prophet go and read Christ Miss got reveal P 7 he is is a personal Vindication to of a person person a child of God filled with the holy spirit so surrender to God that he do not care about anything else right and the Holy Spirit living is living it living it life punctuating through him showing the person a personal Vindication of the word is expressed it is to the people and to and to the world in other words he said this thing is not something that's hi in a corner thing is something that's punctuated people know when you got the Holy Ghost the world know when you got the holy goh go they going to see the signs in other words you you you change something about you you don't do what you used to do you don't work what you used to work it's something D play hu so now we realize him so Jesus came here they we find in the Bible that Jesus find a certain bride Church how that was claiming on him at this hour they was in the message they was in the message they was falling prophet Abraham yeah but they didn't come to the pregnation that's right I found that in St John 8 let me look at here St John 8 for second here go Jesus finding them pregnated the claiming the pregnation of the word and they were saying here they were they were they was here they were they were proving and they were trying they were proving and they could justify on their birth of tiities yeah yeah who they was all right yeah I've been in word people got this spiritual mity and they can show you here I've been raised in the message all my life that's good had the M been in you all your life how that's the difference not raised in it but part of how don't get your know my daddy would been in the message how did my mama been in the message how all the that's good but have you caught the Revelation come on pregnated word bride so he go over here he find his church now they got claims and they got their birth ctivities oh yeah they can look in their they going say well my great-grandfather was Abraham I know who I am yeah but let us find him that's right on so we found here in the in uh in St John the 8th chapter and I'mma place the 31st verse the same time and then it begin to speak St John 8 31 and Jesus said unto those Jews which be believed on him if ye continue in my word yeah are my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free and they answered him will be Abraham seed in other words they got they got claims I got claims on them birth certific I got claims on the I got claims we can prove who we are and we be Abraham see we never in to any man how did it say if y if y shall shall be made free and Jesus said unto them brother brother I say unto you whoever committed sin is the what servant of sin because if God pray you his seed is in you sin can't be there at the same time then he goes and say I speak that which I have seen with my father and you do that which you have seen with your father now Jesus is separating the SE right he show you that that's another G that's another C in the same Revival it produces twins come on under the same message come on that's twins been born amen one say I believe brother BR I'm hold to brother BR for the resurrection and the other side I believe Christ is the res am two all right both them read the same Quotes come on one believe that Jesus Christ Is the personal revelation and un believe the brother is the personal revelation the same message that they were believe in right here they wouldn't believe the Abraham was and Earth believe the Christ was Peter said th the Christ the son of the Living God how he he recognize Christ who shall we go to have the word of eternal life here they over here they said we believe Abraham right to revive right yeah two twins that's in this message oh yeah and let's just show the nature of them right he go through the say here and they say here and I forgot oh yeah what was 35 34 34 okay and he said who said and in 3 and the servant by not in the house forever but but the son by forever if y therefore shall be made you free y shall be free indeed and I know that that Jesus here Jesus is speaking to them direct because he knew who they was he knew who they was I know that you all Abraham SE if Jesus said I know that you are Abraham seed then he says here but they seek to kill me because my word has no place in you there is no ation right exactly H he said I know yep but there's no preg Nation right they under the same Revival sure it was twins ab and now Jesus dealing with them and then Jesus said here my word have no place in you then Jesus go on then Jesus go on from here yes he give me my word and the BL but Jesus said but yeah of your father the what yeah do the Deeds of your father watch what they say right why did they do this why did they say this and I'm going to show you why they say it here they was Jesus telling them you Ain do the Deeds of your father yeah oh yeah he didn't at this time it was still the seals he had broke this mystery yet right so now they can still say what is he talking about so they had one thing they had over on Jesus right his birth right they were denying that the birth was Supernatural they they that they denying that they have denied that the experience is Supernatural they tried to say we can get it by knowledge we can get it by this but you got to have a personal Supernatural experience with the Holy Ghost how you sure he says here didn't say they unto him will not be born of fornication that's right we have one father even God oh my we got something on you know you want to get to get attitude we'll let people know who you are child of the fornication yeah they couldn't got that in the word cuz it wouldn't in there if they would have went back to the word they would have seen is say Virg I don't know how they come over to Theory right but they were believeing it so now he go and say here he said he said then they said unto him we not be born of fornication Jesus said unto them if you were if y were God if if if if a question a question H I know you're not right H I'm not going to say that you're God children because if I speak the word you have to be that right oh yeah so he just put it you know is a question now it's something if you notice he answer this thing not direct he answer this thing with a you know if you were but I know you're not right so now he got to left them in the middle of the road so they still thinking they in the message he said he said if you were if you were if God were your father you would y would what love me love me cuz he knew that the devil cannot impersonate Divine love he knew that that love of God was in him the devil would not be able to impersonate he impersonate he said but I proceive forth I proceed forth and came from God need I came on myself but but he Des sent me and why do ye not understand my what because because you canot hear my word the evidence of being filled with the Holy Ghost the ability to hear God word how did Faith come by here and I hearing the word of God right so now he breaks the seals and show who they are it was an antichrist riding he was riding through the church he was Antichrist he was an but sooner or later he revealed who he was he showed in The Pale Horse who the Antichrist was R he said but y of your father the devil right but devil a strong piece of yeah oh yeah stus woman yeah have your father the devil in the lust of your father y will do he was a murder from the what beginning but not in the what truth and there is no what in him trth when he speak a li he speak of his own and he is a what liar and the what of it father that's why when they came to Jesus they was already pregnated with a lie right they was not pregnated with the word because this lie him been born in fornication had already took hold in their lives so that's why they couldn't receive the word because their wound was already cold to the r to the word when the word was revealed they were believe in a lie H they was they was they were raised under this message they come up but they just they was already pregnant with something come on you talk to somebody that pregnated in any false doctors around me perusers thund and all the things that they get in them you cannot talk to s that's right that's right brother tell right now this is what this is what we got to this is what my brother this is what so and so started right here this is what I believe they already pregnated with something else but if the bride is Jesus Christ if you pregnated with the word you always go back to the word I am pregnant with the Holy Ghost but the basic thing of it is they were chosen that's right people basic well I was chosen I know I'm part of it oh yeah I'm part of it I'm chosen of God so with Judas that's right Judas didn't come in Judas was chosen how but many are chosen how all the CH of Judah was chosen of God he was the type of those that heard the word and the the riches right and power right he was chosen to God the brother in the church but Judas himself he was chosen of God and he was disrupted in truth so that Judah Not only was he chosen he was the truth he shared the knowledge of the mystery he had the ministry of give of power granted unto him he he and he healed the SI he cast out devils in Jesus name but when The Showdown came he sold out H he sold out how for politics power he did not go up to Pentecost to receive the spirit of God Judah was already pregnant with God chose him come on you know what I think Jud was pregnated when God chose him right right he was already the child of the devil he was the mystery of the devil revealed when God chose him how you know because Jesus said in say John here say John 6 verse 17 he I have not I chosen you 12 and one of you is a devil right he knew who he was he was already believing the lie so now we got to go back to pray Hy you say what you trying to say brother so now you find out here if the pregnation that took place and ain't other word and you say pregn with the word of God if I pr with the word of God it got to be fruit to prove and Jesus said when all men know that you are my disciples right when all men will know that you are my disciple not when you have tongues right not when you shout right he said all man will know you my discip will you have love one for the other by this will all man know right long away from that we a long way from that you disagree with somebody you find out right oh yeah you you really find out you disagree right but in other words so so we got to go here we begin to realize here so we go to this we go to the thing right here so we begin to look here we say Lord you know what what what what what we looking for I tell you right here we going to prove what they pray with the people today what are they pray with they will not stay with the word all the way that's right Hallelujah you got to stay with the word Hall what today because they w't stay with the word how how you know when a man ain't stand with the word his body will reflect what he believe the church that leave the word that body will reflect it you can't hi pregnation right right spoken word c page 67 he what is she she's pregnant Christ bride she has become pregnant with the worldly dress oh my everything going toward the world all right the worldly dress like the world uh act like the world act like the world the world is the world big churches in other words nothing wrong with it if you can for what it shows that she is pregnated she is of the devil huah everything begin to go toward the world hallel in other words in other words now we don't get messages from the from the inspiration we got to go read Jan doson whatever his name is David re everybody got to find some other inspiration to have something to preach to their Church Hallelujah if you ever get the Holy Ghost the Bible become a new book you don't have to read nobody B everything that you need to know from gen Revelation I going back to God God Glory Hallelujah I'm going put my parachute on now okay hu putting it on I'm going to jump in a few minutes so hold on give ready jum I don't one got the evening service I'm going to jump how to go here so I'm going to take one more scripture here that look at this pregnant what kind of pregnation she's got yeah and I took it from the book I I tell what happened you said brother I come to the word yeah had the word pregnant you amen because coming to the word and having a love for the word is two different things Hallelujah the word coming to the word have a love for the word it's two different things how if you come to the word and the word is in you got a love for God in the word and for his people right and I begin to look here so when he got to Judah Judah was already pregnant with the already of the pregnation of the devil that why Judah could not go up to Pentecost and receive the holy God but when he came the P it looked like Peter was the one the devil you ever thought about it it looked like Peter was the devil Jesus said I rebuke you I give your hand hi me Satan he rebuked this demon that was on Peter H but I want to tell you what Jesus did that he never did for Judas yes sir he did something for Peter brother than he never did for Judas he he he where the Judas was going on Judas sold Jesus out he said he said I have told you 12 and one of you is a devil it would have been me if you would have been in this message and they would say that you knew you were jet you would be trying to find out who I am so even though I've been fasting and praying Lord give me the baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't want to be that one how they went over here and here go Jesus and told him this now Jesus telling them rebuking the demon on Peter then he turned around and said to Peter he turned around and did something for Peter he never did this for Judah he said Peter the devil desires to sip you as wheat right but don't worry all right I pray for you if I pray for somebody I got him on my mind I got you on my mind people how you going to go through many trials you going to go through many tribulations but I already pray for you hallelu that your faith shall not fa that's the thing right there Hallelujah God got you on his mind H he cannot lose you my sheet is on my mind and I shall not lose the water of no man should take them from me how go here go Peter Jesus tell Peter Peter three Peter do you love me Peter said Lord you know I love you feed my sheep Peter do you love me Lord you know I love you feed my lamb Peter do you love man don't you ask me that no more he said when you get the Holy Ghost Peter that's right get scripting the brothers he could drug Peter right now Peter kill him you get that old C nature over you when you get that old falling nature over youen my brother Peter but right now you ain't got it hallelujah thank you Jesus knew that Peter loved him so much that Peter was willing to die with him that's right he knew this and he knew if I don't do something something to stop Peter Peter going get in the way of my plan and he can the word can't be broken so what did he did to Peter he had a propy on Peter to keep Peter from breaking the scripture so when Peter denied Jesus he didn't deny Jesus he denied Jesus because Jesus told him before the car three times you going to deny if he hadn't done it then Jesus would have said something that was wrong but Jesus knew he was standing in the word when he denied him how KN that why when Jeter R from the dead he knew that Peter was under depression come on he said go tell my disciple I tell know all my death my bir my resurrection I can never forget Peter people we realize here you pregnant it with this word the devil will never be able to take you from God right hall some people say brother I fell away I didn't come back I said if you ever get preg with the word of God the devil was me you might go through ups and down but the the devil would never be able that's right to pull you from Christ you give up on God you never be able to do that accept in word they did you keep your religion he said no it kept me hallel my Revelation is been keeping me day after day it ain't me doing it it's Christ you the over GL begin to hear the musicians come you're not trying to become a pregnated bride he said when the seals open you receive the word and you hear this word something took place right two unipi met Glory Hall two unipi me that's right amen you would always was y brother say you never become Sheep by rebirth that's right you always was a sheep that's right you need to recognize the call The Eagle did not become a eagle right because he was born in the chicken yard that did not me make him an eagle what made him an eagle he was an eagle when he was in the chicken yard how God didn't change a chicken into an eagle right that eagle was just out of place right right just like we was we come into the world shaped in iniquity born in the chicken been born in the chicken Barnard acting like the world talking like the world doing the things of the world we always was an eagle but the influence we was under it was it was the nature of this chicken falling nature H I'm not put chicken out cuz I love chicken I'm just using this for a point so when I go down there I'm going to eat the chicken and I'm praying on the chicken and don't nobody say nothing about it because I don't care what they put in it I'm Sanctified so just leave me alone with my chicken one brother one brother said brother said he get all in the mess brother we don't eat chicken no more we you know that's brother we need to get away from that chicken and and all this stuff I said man I'm not quit eating my
