TRANSCRIPT
========================================
yeah but I can't say there we go all right we're on we're done we're ready God bless you brothers and sisters certainly good to be back with y'all and um already been enjoying the the fellowship um let's just have a word of prayer Our precious father we love thee Lord and we thank you for this opportunity Lord that we can come together and study upon your word and father we just come asking you to take total control and Lord you speak the things that are needful for for your children we give you thanks for it father in Jesus lovely name amen amen going to go to several scriptures Genesis 3 Colossians 1 Romans 5 2 Corinthians 5 start out at Genesis 3 verse 11 I'm going to move through it quickly so if you have to you get lost don't worry about it and he said who told thee that thou was naked hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou should us not eat and the man said the woman whom thou gavest to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat the Lord God said unto the woman what is this that thou Hast done the woman said the serpent begal me and I did eat the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou Hast done this thou are cursed above all cattle above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seat and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel to the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children thy desire shall be thy husband and he shall rule over thee and unto Adam he said because thou Hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and Hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee saying that shall not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field in the sweat of thy faith shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of the out of it was thou taken for dust Thou Art and unto dust thou shal return Colossians chapter 2 I'm sorry chapter one not chapter 2 we're going to start verse 16 for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and drop down to verse 20 and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him I say whether they be things in Earth or things in heaven and you that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblamable and unreprovable in his sight if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which ye have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under Heaven whereof I Paul and made a minister now verse 26 even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus that's right Romans chapter 3 or I'm sorry Romans is the third thing Romans chapter 5 and verse 1 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience patient experience and experience hope and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us for when we were yet without Strength In Due Time Christ died for the ungodly verse 8 but God commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us much more then being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life and not only so but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we have now received the atonement that's it all right Second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 14 for the love of Christ constrain us because we thus judge that if one died for all then were all dead and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yay though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of God Amen who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation yes to Wi are to understand that God was in Christ reconcile the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them amen and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did bech you by us we pray you in Christ dead be ye reconciled to God for he has made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him right so we started out there in Genesis and the reason I went to that is to show you where the enmity came into being prior to that there was no enmity but at that point that's when the enmity was put between us and God right it wasn't between us and Satan it was between us and God the enmity is the carnal mind the human nature because the scripture clearly tells us that the carnal mind is death so that enmity which is death was placed between us and it separated us from God in that it separated so to speak the soul from the spirit so we were born a spiritual being controlling us and that spirit being was born with a wrong nature it was born with a nature of a beast and that nature controlled us until the point of the new birth and once you have the new birth then you are no longer to be controlled by that Beast likee nature you now have a new nature that will control that spirit and cause you to walk in new things a new life a new way different from what you were before now we talked about Recon reconciled and Reconciliation reconcile is a financial or an investment type word to be reconciled is to make it balanced one thing you go through the Old Testament one thing that God cursed and cursed as an Abomination was an unequal balance he hated it right he absolutely hated it right and whenever people used an unequal balance what are you talking about when they would take like if you went to the man to get wheat and he said it was going to be a dollar and you put a dollar up there well he had his balance set up so that he only gave you back 90 cents worth of wheek so he was getting more from you than he was giving in return even though he told you it was a dollar he's only giving you back 90 cents but his balance made it look like everything was equal and God has hated that all down through time amen but until the cross came see we saw there in Colossians that it was at his cross that he made peace what does peace mean it means the destruction or the removal of the enmity right he removed the enmity between us and him amen prior to that point if you look down through the Old Testament there was only one person that could ever walk up face to face and talk to God himself and he had to do that physically dressed in a certain way physically doing certain things physic Bally carrying a physical blood and sprinkling it before him and carrying an incense in order for him to come into God's presence why because he stunk in God's nostrils that man had to put on that outer covering and carry those outer things in order to cover up his stench in God's nostrils because he was coming in the nature of a beast even though those things were given for a covering it did not remove that Beast like nature but once Christ came on the cross he took upon our sin our unbelief he became unbelief for us he took ours he took it down into hell and put it back on the shoulders of the one that it came from in original and so it no longer now rest in us it's now put back on Satan's there amen okay um he aen a lot with her hands so when you when you look at that reconcile it means to put the balance back in place right amen that's good now as as brother Wade said when he was explaining that earlier Adam could not reconcile anything he did not have anything that he could invest right but Jesus Christ in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily so when he died he put the investment he deposited into the account everything that is ever required for you and I to be balanced that's good everything that's ever come against us there is a balance sitting there that you and I can draw from that will cancel the debt that's good so at any time that we have a sin after we are born again because the prophet clearly told us that only Christians can sin so it's stumbling and falling there is a deposit an account with a full deposit that can never be withdrawn down to a zero right you can never write a check on that account and it come back and say insufficient funds it's always more than sufficient amen as he told the Apostle Paul Paul my grace is sufficient right so whatever you have need of whatever it is at any time you reach and you write that check and send it and the bank of Heaven sends back whatever you need it's extended out to you to clear the balance see Satan's always trying to attach a balance to us just like the prophet taught us whenever God purchased us and brought us back out of that pawn shop Satan's constantly trying to get us back into that pawn shop so every time we turn around we're having to repent we're having to do this we're having to do that right and so God made that deposit so that you and I can go free amen and it's free in deed there's no way he can put us back in that past house um Jesus the scripture says that whenever he came at after the River Jordan when the spirit of the Lord came upon him he walked into the synagogue he read the book and then the scripture says he closed the book right and he sat down so when he closed the book see that's what you do anybody that has a business or Works in a business and understands those financial things closing the book is reconciling every everything together that's right whenever the spirit of the Lord recognized him as being that perfect one the book was now being closed because now man and God were reconciled am and when he closed that book and sat down then he was now taking the full Authority on the cross when he said it is finished that's right m then the books were totally completely done for all eternity there was no other thing that could be brought that could cause the debt to be back in place that's right nothing could put that debt back in place the only thing that can put that debt back in place is when you and I have unbelief that's right and then that puts us back into the pawn shop because of our own unbelief and that's when we have to go back and say wait a minute I'm not that person that's not me and you say well I Stumble I fall well that's true we all stumble and fall because we are still in cursed ground right that's right this ground that you and I live in is still under the curse that's right so at any time that we happened us to allow it to take control that's when we stumble that's right because as long as we're operating from that position of Faith then there's no way that Satan can do anything with us amen he has the the Lord has given him access to the flesh to attack it that's right but he's never given him free control right even when he turned him loose and allowed him to do all those things to job remember he reserved you can't touch his life why God has that life reserved unto himself and it's the life that cleanses everything in the body right in the message invisible union he says well you separated from your first Union by spiritual death now you are born again or remarried again to the new spiritual union of not your natural life of the things of the world but of eternal Life The Germ that was in you at the beginning found you right now your old book is gone with your old Union so all of those things that you did before that point in time you know the scripture has from that time all right when when the time the day that you recognize that you were a son or daughter of God from that time you that's the reason the prophet said drive down that state right you know you drive down that state from that time from that point no matter what he brings back to you from that point he can't there's nothing he can behind that state it's all written that's right amen and every day you know the scripture says Don't Let the Sun Go Down on your wrath all right so whenever you get upset in the day before the sun goes down repent that's right make it right be angry and sin not so these things is what we do as Christians and it keeps us clean now the only way we can be clean is from that germ of God that Jesus released on the cross to come into you and I and brother Wade has told me that y'all been studying on the stature of a perfect man and when you look at all that there is nothing that there that is humanly possible Right everything there comes out of that deposit that Jesus Christ made that day on Calvary so that faith it comes out of that deposit because it's just like he told the Apostle Peter Flesh and Blood ha not revealed this unto you but my Father which in heaven has revealed it unto you so when you get to that point of Faith that's when you have recognized who he is and that you belong to him right so that's Faith because when you recognize that Satan can't shake that see amen he can shake anything else but once that Revelation strikes you and you know who God is and you know that you are part of him Satan becomes ineffective that's right now that virtue and knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and divine love were all deposited that day at Calvary so it was all finished that day but nevertheless those are character those are part of your character and so the character has to be built it has to be grown everything that you needs already in you AB but it takes squeezing that's right to reveal what's there that's right and it's when that squeezing starts happening on us that's when it starts coming out see and revealing what was actually deposited in you because it's when those things in life happen that we re recognize what God really did for us and and there's that is the way God set it up it's not us we don't have any control over that's right I I would like to you know for me I would just like okay I'm I'm born again it's over with yeah yeah no more trials no more tribulations but that's not what the word says it's that you know tribulation worketh patience well there there there it is so you're going to have a lot of tribulation here to get to that point that's right and so that's that's what's required and it's it's God's way of shaping us into his own character because it's his character that he places within us absolutely but we have a character that tries to always step in Step In step in you know that's right the the easiest thing to talk about is the husband and wife relationship you know so whenever whenever my wife says something to me you know there's another nature that steps in there trying to take over see and what's it what's it trying to do it's trying to make her act the same way right re see re puts you back into that old nature and then the next thing you know we won't even talk to one another for two or three days and then the next thing you know there's more problems and more problems until finally if that thing's not reconciled you bust up and go separate ways and it all start over something stupid usually but Satan that's just how that's just how well he knows that nature that we're born of he knows how to trick you into doing something so that's the reason that the scripture tells us in the Le oysan address be zealous and repent that's right be zealous be quick to repent right because in this day time is moving so fast that in a few days a person can go from almost a perfect marriage to a total disaster right and it's not just marriage because the marriage relationship reflects the other relationships in your life relationships with your children with your your co-workers and all those different things it'll do the same thing to a church because it's that same relationship that's right and whenever things start getting out of balance you have to start pointing back to the right place and it's always back to the Cross because it's at the cross the deposit was made amen and it's at the cross that the human nature died not his dying yeah died the scripture we read it yeah we died with him when he died we died when he raised up in newness we raised up in so everything was reconciled at that point but it's us recognizing ing it and saying I'm not part of it right see it's no different than you having a a I mean a thought of curse words coming through wanting you to say those words sure and what do you do you take the word yep I don't do that right I don't speak like that right that's not me right a thought comes to commit fornication or adultery what do you do you take the word that's not me you separate those things from you see you're pointing right back to that cross you're crucifying that old nature every time you do that you're pointing it right back to where it died so it wants to come and take control but you point it back to where it died because we're not trying to learn to die we're already dead in Christ and so it's that newness of Life coming forth where all of these things have become new right anybody can have human love got two minutes Mr moderator okay anybody can have brotherly kindness humanly sure all of these things sure but those are worthless absolutely those are absolutely worthless if it is not godly that's right if it is not God's Own love that's right amen that's right it's a waste amen so that's the reason we have to look at that and be sure that we're looking at the cross and we're taking that man raised up afterwards in that perfect body that you and I have prepared for us so the Lord God bless you that brother Tim brother Tim's the moderator at our ministers meetings and you can Minister gets 5 minutes he'll go buddy two minutes you shut her down you're [Music] done she'll be in tonight L comes in at 10:30 tonight we'll just
