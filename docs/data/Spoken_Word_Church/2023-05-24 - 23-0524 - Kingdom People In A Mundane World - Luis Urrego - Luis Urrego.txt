sailing and Grand tomorrow and Abby Grace Friday and also says Rebecca has a testimony if you want to make your way up for your testimony God bless you all amen thank the Lord um I just want to share this testimony sometime you know when something come on your heart to do it you don't do it right away is still feeling like it's going away so um this happened a couple weeks ago it's got to do with my tidings and um I would set my ties aside but sometimes if I have it on me and I need a little extra cash I'll dip into it and I'll just tell the Lord I'll pay you back when I you know I'll pay you back I'll put it back in there so that was going on for a while and um lately I just started feeling like you know what learning leave your money alone and and just when I put it aside leave it there and just send it where I need to go on time so um I made kind of like a little vow with my heart and make a big deal out of it um so this particular day a couple weeks ago I was getting ready for church and I ended up putting like um about ten dollars or so in my pocket in one of my skirts pocket and um sometime if I'm rushing I'll stop and get something to eat you know before I get to church so um for some reason I went somewhere and came back home I changed my skirt and everything and I forgot about the ten dollars in my pocket so all I had was my tax money and I had that in my purse already and um I was making my way to go get something to eat and I realized I changed my skirt so I was like man you know and I thought about my times I said well you know maybe I can just go ahead and get it and um I got I got the money at home so I can always replace it but as soon as I did that like that little feeling of my spirit came on and said well you remember me made a little vow in your heart that you weren't gonna touch that tax money again so um I was like man you know there's a little devil on your shoulder like well you know gotta understand you know you'd be all right so um I was like nah something else convinced me like no just do what you said you're gonna do because if you buy this burger or whatever you're gonna be eating and feeling guilty you ain't gonna enjoy it you know so um I was like yeah Mama just leave it gotta somehow provide I was hungry that day only I was hungry I was like gotta provide somehow some food gonna come from somewhere I'm going to church so um I stopped at a little um gas station uh not too far on the way and I was like well sometimes they let me get a free cup of coffee you know I'm gonna go in there and see if that coffee Mike and slap that hungry you know so I had like 80 cents on me I had like 80 cents on me and changing my car said well I'm gonna go in here and see if they give me a cup of coffee and I'll pay them back you know uh so I went in there the lady was like go ahead you know I told her what happened I left my money on my skirt and um I'll pay you when I come back and she was like go ahead get the coffee or whatever so I enjoyed the coffee on the way to church or whatever um I got to church I sat down and um I wasn't even thinking anymore about the money or anything I just sat down kind of opened up my Bible when I opened it I seen ten dollars in there folded up and um it was just I know it's little but it was special to me you know it was ten dollars in my Bible and my mom when she was with me maybe a week or so back a couple days ago she had ten dollars and she got some changes she forgot what she did with the ten dollars and she asked me to look at my Bible to see if she ended up putting it in there and I totally forgot about it I I didn't even look I wasn't thinking I forgot about the ten dollars or forgot to even look so anyway I'm just saying that to say um God already knew and she had her purse and everything with it I don't know why she put it in my Bible but God already knew what was going to happen ahead of time and to allow her to do that and just set everything up I just want to lift him up he's so wonderful in the small things and the big things and he tested us when we give him a little Vibe too now so that's it come on uh if you would also Brother house of having a

boy amen God bless you all it's good to be in the house of the Lord now amen so good to think that this life amen the life that we know this current civilization that we know of Amen it will disappear it will be done away with because right now this is Satan's kingdom amen but there is a kingdom that cannot be moved and that Kingdom amen should be working in each one of us right now praise the Lord those of you who have the Holy Ghost because why the Holy Ghost is that Kingdom if you're born again amen into the kingdom of God not only do you have possession of the Kingdom amen but the kingdom has possession of you amen so let that Kingdom be born in US amen that we may manifest that Kingdom on the outside amen and if you I like what brother brother William said this this past Sunday I've often said the same thing is that if you can't get a whole possession of this Kingdom how are you going to possess this Kingdom out here amen that's why Jesus said amen if you if you how can you help your brother amen spiritually when you're you need spiritual help you see that's why he told Peter he said amen uh go get converted first before you can go strengthen your brethren amen so what is an important thing in this house it's good to be in the house of the Lord this evening amen we just appreciate each and every one of you and thank you all for what you all have done this past weekend during the meetings you know how many just enjoyed that word this this past Sunday hi I thoroughly enjoyed Amen brother William this on Sunday especially he did a wonderful job bringing that out and and uh just enjoyed the word of the Lord enjoyed the fellowship amen and thank you all for those who who took part to helping out amen we appreciate that and um so we're going to go ahead and go to the Lord this morning or this evening I promise I won't keep you all along amen but just continue to remember brother brother Wade and sister June and just the Lord registered I have I don't know what the update is on sister June I guess she came out okay all right good all right so you can see how much I get on WhatsApp so um but I praise the Lord if she's come out okay so just continue to remember her that she would continue to recover speedily amen also for her situation with with that sciatica that's really bothering her so just remember her as well I mean listening to our Bibles in Luke chapter 17. Luke chapter 17 we're going to start at verse 20. hey man I want to title this Kingdom people in the mundane world amen do you believe that the kingdom of God can exist and can shine Amen in amundane mundane daily routine of life oh my is just get up eat breakfast anything and it just be like corn flakes or something like that it ain't like sausage based biscuits and gravy you know you know I got my corn flakes and uh I put on my shoes I may have time to brush my teeth and then you know I go ahead and go go to work and you know and on my way you know I'll get a cup of coffee you know and it sort of spills in the car a little bit as I'm trying to drive and you know and I get to work and come back home is this all there is to life you might ask but do you think that the kingdom of God can shine in the middle of your routine do you think that the kingdom of God can shine in the middle of you sisters amen out there changing your baby's diapers the kingdom of God can shine in the mid of you scrubbing that next that my husband left that bowl of corn flakes from the night before and it just dried up and stuck in that bowl and I just can't get it out you think that the the the kingdom of God can shine in that amen I believe it can see we don't think that God is not in these little in these little matters amen but I believe God is in those matters hence the reason why God allowed them in your life because he's building character why he's building Kingdom people praise the Lord amen so we're just gonna we're gonna read this in Luke chapter 17. and when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come he answered them and said the kingdom of God cometh not with observation in other words it's not noticeable it's you can't really tell that it's even there amen neither shall they say Lo here or Lo there for behold the kingdom of God is within you amen I like the way the New Living Translation says it it says it this way one day the Pharisees asked Jesus when all the kingdom of God when will the kingdom of God come Jesus replied the kingdom of God can't be detected by visible signs hmm you won't be able to say here it is or it's over there for the kingdom of God is already among you now that was Jesus speaking because why he is the kingdom amen so I like the way it's it's phrases it there because it can't be within you at that time because Jesus had not died and resurrected and have not come back in the form of the holy spirit so it wasn't within them at that time amen but it was amongst them at the time later it comes in in them amen in the form of the Holy Spirit praise the Lord Jesus and one more scripture in Zechariah Chapter 4 it says very familiar scripture on to us verses 5. then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and I said know my Lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto the rubable saying not by might nor by power in other words no pushing or pulling or no pulling or pushing has nothing to do with you but why but by my spirit says the Lord of hosts amen you may be seated this evening praise the Lord amen so not by might not by power amen but by my spirit saith the Lord and and I I'll put that scripture in there because the spirit amen we know that the holy spirit this spirit is the kingdom of God Amen and and we we know that the spirit of the Lord amen we're going to read that verse 7 there in Zechariah towards the end of the service but we know that the spirit of the Lord amen That Came Upon Jesus who is the kingdom amen and what did it do when the when the spirit Came Upon him amen remember when Jesus got up and he and and he was given to him amen the scroll he went to the temple the Bible says as was his custom amen so Jesus went to church amen Jesus made it accustomed to go to church amen it might be a a it was a routine amen well it's Sunday so we go to church it's Wednesday so we go to church every time those doors amen open we go we go to church amen and I'm not I'm not hitting on anybody who hasn't come or wasn't here Sunday that's not what I'm trying to do I'm just trying to tell you that brother but that that Jesus went to church amen and he went to church and he's our example how much more should we do that amen praise God so and and Luke chapter 4 verse 16 it says and and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up amen and as as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiahs and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written and it's interesting because the Bible says it that way that he found the place in other words he was specifically searching for that specific spot amen because if you don't search you don't find right so I believe that's just me personally I I believe that he actually specifically went to that specific searching for that specific scripture amen because there was something that was getting ready to unfold there amen and he says there and he says and the spirit of the Lord is upon me he started reading this scripture the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of them that were in the synagogue were fasting on him and he began to say unto them this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears amen now we're going to ready and now in verse 22 it says and all bear him witness and wondered at the gracious Words which proceeded out of his mouth and they said the people around them said is this not Joseph's son in other words he's he's a commoner or monk says is this not Joseph's son someone common someone who didn't who didn't seem like that the kingdom was there that the king that was showing forth the kingdom but the kingdom of God was right there amongst them amen and they didn't even know the Messiah that they were praying about and they were asking for was standing right there in front of them and they had no clue that it was happening praise the Lord amen I forgot we forgot to pray so let's just buy our heads real quick our heavenly father we just thank you once again for the opportunity to open back the pages of your word we asked Lord Jesus that you would just to anoint your word father as we go forth and speak father God a few things Lord to help encourage your people Lord may you just bless put your anointing upon it father for this is your word Lord forgive us for all of our sins Lord and cleanse us father and we pray Lord Jesus that you would just be with us father and be with sister June and and those that couldn't be here father God may you just bless them Lord and strengthen them Father God touch their bodies Lord Jesus and and we just commit the rest of the service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name and For Your Glory we ask amen amen praise the Lord Jesus now brother Brandon says says here we've we've read this quote many times and and speaking about what Jesus uh what happened here in this in this uh situation where where Jesus was reading this scripture brother Brown says this he says some people gets the wrong impression of what the anointing is did you ever think of that when was the greatest anointing ever give to anyone and what did they do when they had the anointing now we have we especially those who grew up in the Pentecostal realms you know I grew up as a Baptist Catholic uh Jehovah's Witness so I was bringing pretty much ho-hum type of religions you know people didn't really Shout Scream and if you clapped your hands in the Baptist Church I mean you were looked at very badly that was a No-No amen so it it was no but so it was very new to me when I came to the message and I started visiting message churches and and people were more active and more lively and more clapping and things like that I was almost it was I was almost in condemning mode I'm like a bunch of sinners look at them making all that noise and all that racket when we should be holy the Lord deserves respect but you see later on I I started learning amen that that everything that has breath praised the Lord I started learning amen that that that that that nature rejoices amen and praises the Lord in its way amen when the wind blows amen through the trees the trees don't stay still the trees start to move amen when when when when when things are happening amen and the Animals amen they will get up the birds get up in the morning amen you don't think the birds are quiet I mean the birds you hear them birds outside your window and I got this one little bird outside my window right there at the back of my house it has this specific little chirp and normally birds are good and they're fine they're lovely but this one's got a certain chirp I don't know if it's sick or what but it it it sounds sick but it's praising the Lord amen because God gave him that that ability to do so amen it's it's doing what it was meant to do amen I believe he's praising the Lord or maybe he's he's trying to draw attention or whatever he's doing but I believe that he's doing it amen because he's praising his creator amen praise the Lord Jesus and so we we see that we come here into this life amen and and we we worship in different ways amen so I grew up that way amen and I started to realize amen people amen they have their different ways of of worshiping amen that's just how it is some some of us are more quiet some of us are more loud some of us are more in the kind of in the middle in between amen but God loves it all God doesn't prefer one over the other amen and so neither should we as as well that's why I I personally do not I believe there should be balance in in this way of thinking because here amongst people amen we we see that some Prevail in the idea of if you're not if you're not too real real Pentecostal like amen then you're not you're not getting the blessings of the Lord but then we so we have here some uh right here on this side amen that say well you got to be quiet and you just have to just you have to just be very reverent and very quiet and I believe that you have to be reverent amen but there's a there's a point amen that that there's got to be a balance amen there's a balance amen because when when something strikes you amen and and and and God has done something in your life you can't help but do something about that you can't help to tell someone you can't help to to to to to to to let someone know to sing about it to shout about it amen I'm just kind of going a little bit of what brother William was saying because I really enjoyed what he had to say on Sunday amen I thought that that was very striking amen very Timely many people nowadays amen is very unbalanced you have those that are very Pentecostal and if you don't lean that way then you're not in the message but then those amen who just very much quiet amen and it's all about if you just don't listen and T and and it's all about the teaching then you're not in the message and I believe there's a balance of both amen that's why God gave us a thoughtful Ministry amen it's a balance what do we have to have a balanced diet in order to live a balanced life so if you have to have a balanced diet physically how much more spiritually amen so you Worship the Lord in the way that God gave you to worship God amen and no one should condemn you for let uh if maybe you're not doing it right then the Lord let the Lord deal with you on that but you be the one amen but within inside of you amen you say Lord I I want to worship you because I'm so thankful what you've done in my life I'm so I'm so appreciative of what you have uh uh uh how you've led me how you have protected me I remember that certain situation back in in in a certain time amen and how God you you watched over me during that time I got something to worship you about I got something to praise you about I got something amen that to to testify about amen appreciate sister Rebecca and her testimony amen it was just ten ten dollars amen but it was ten dollars that's worth for for a testimony amen that was a blessing for her and that was her way of worshiping amen is for her to testify about it sometimes amen we don't want to testify because maybe God isn't doing some anything in our lives so we really don't have a testimony and that's not his fault that's your fault hey man that's you and I fault amen God wants to do great things in our lives amen so that we could share testimony so that we can we can uh let others know so that it can light their fire like their candles praise the Lord Jesus all right don't get sleepy on me so we see here amen that Jesus brother Brandon says here let's continue reading this this quote the greatest anointing that was ever given to anyone was Jesus Christ we have the spirit by measure he had it without measure and one day he entered into the temple and picked up the scroll and read said the spirit of God is upon me for he has anointed me to preach the acceptable year to bind up the broken hearts to heal the sick give sight to the Blind and now we would think if such anointing was on him that that have been prophesied 800 years before that it would come and here he was with that type of anointing the full blessing and anointing of the Lord upon him we would want to run all over the building scream and holler that that's what we would think I mean especially if those who who grew up in the Pentecostal Realms amen you hear the word anointing of God is upon it starts shaking and you start amen that's fine that but it just really depends on how you grew up you see and so we would think that that the anointing how many can say that Jesus had the anointing there while he was reading that scripture but but watch what brother Brown says if you haven't read this quote before we would want to run all over the building scream and holler but the Bible said he laid down the scroll and sat down and press his words proceeded from his mouth now I believe he wasn't slobbering and shouting and talking real close to the microphone [Music] if they didn't have microphone at that time that's what he done under the anointing that's what he done under the anointing he just put the scroll the scripture up and started speaking words from his mouth amen I believe the people understood because they reacted to what he was saying amen and watch what he says here brother Branham this is your prophet he says here the anointing is not emotions but he's not saying that emotions are bad that that's where we misunderstand that having an emotion a genuine emotion amen happened to you because the holy spirit is working and and doing something amen hey let that happen because we all need to to to to to uh to to receive from that as well but what choice has here the anointing is supreme power in control now what is the power amen is the power the power of the Holy Ghost amen supreme power in control like knowing exactly what and how see and that's what's here so I believe brother Brandon is saying amen that that's what the holy spirit will cause you to do that's what the great anointing will cause you to do is supreme power in control amen it's no and amen knowing when to and when not to amen because for those who are more quiet and have grown up in more quiet type churches now what does this have to do with mundane and stuff like that we'll get to that in here in just a moment but for those who like it quiet oh they love that quote oh Amen to that oh yes hit them hit those Pentecostal type of Brothers that hold those tent meetings and shouting and just causing a ruckus amen just hit him and they love that quote they love that that Jesus that Jesus right there they like but what about the Jesus when Jesus was sitting on a donkey one day riding on on a coal on on on on a donkey and here comes the people and the Bible says his disciples were the ones his own disciples were the ones who started the shouting and the hosannas and all of that and everybody else started it as well I mean it started following along as well praising God Amen and the Pharisees the ones that go you know to the quiet Church they started rebuking Jesus telling him why don't you say something your disciples they're disturbing the peace and what did Jesus say he said if they don't cry out the rocks will amen now the Pentecostal type of Brothers now they love that type of Jesus they like that Jesus you see that's how we should be that's how it is but see I believe that there should be a balance in all of it let the Holy Spirit do what he wants to do and you are you should be able to willing to Pivot Amen to however the holy spirit is moving but that's the thing we've grown up in certain ways certain mentality and if the holy spirit is moving a certain way until oh I like it okay it's moving it's fine but if it's doing it's right oh no I I can't seem to Pivot towards that because I'm starchy I am settled in my in my ways and I don't think that that's what God is calling us to do God is not God is calling us to be flexible look what he says Look what Jesus says Amen in in Matthew chapter 10 verse 16 he says behold I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves be therefore wise as serpents amen and harmless as doves amen in other words be flexible be willing to Pivot amen when it's neat when it's needed because the brother that's shouting the sister that's screaming or or happy rejoicing in the Lord amen she's just praising God just as you are praising God in your heart amen with your hand down maybe you're not raising your hand but you you're something's happening in you neither one should be condemning one another one should be condemning one another praise the Lord amen so what's the point I'm trying to make what I'm trying to say is have balance and be flexible in your life amen praise God don't just be settled in your ways because I'm going to tell you God is moving and if you have put if the children of Israel if they settled on their own in their way and they put that stake down and they put that tent right there and God kept on moving amen God was they was just gonna be left behind and Moses was going to cross the Red Sea with all the children and they were still back there in the desert Left Behind you're gonna be left behind if you just all settle in your ways and you think that your way is your only way praise the Lord God is moving God is changing amen there's there's this new generation that's coming up amen you have to deal with them in different ways now it can't be the way it was dealt with 50 60 years ago amen they're they're rising up they're seeing different things they're looking at uh uh you have to deal with them in totally different ways and I can't I can't go back amen and look and see how people were fighting at the time I appreciate the old Fighters amen I appreciate brother Dale I appreciate each one of the brothers amen that fought and opened this way amen for us I I'm so thankful for that amen amen we appreciate the ministry amen but I can't go back and look at that and and and get and get caught up in those same type of spirits amen where they were fighting with each other and arguing and fussing and talking and preaching against each other I can't do that amen I just can't get with that I got to move on because this generation needs God just like that generation needed God this generation needs God and I think there's many Brethren from nowadays amen they're realizing that they're seeing amen we can't be fighting and and and and and and back there and the way people were back then these kids they need God you need God you need someone to help you to learn how to be a better mother someone to help you to learn how to be a better father how to be a better a better brother or a better sister amen fussing and arguing about doctrines it didn't ever take us anywhere they all in LED was separations and and condemnations and and here we are amen nowadays amen it's about him it's about Jesus Christ it's about about the young people getting the Holy Ghost amen what are we doing for them so the kingdom of God Amen being reflected Amen in a mundane world Amen in your routine praise God so let's get him back to this to this powerful Kingdom amen of everyday living so here in Luke chapter 17 verse 20 it says and when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come he answered them and said the kingdom of God cometh with no observation in other words there is nothing that you can say there's the kingdom of God that's it you see because it it does this and that and the other amen you Jesus said the wind bloweth and it cometh but you don't and that and that's how the spirit is you don't know where it comes you don't know where it goes that's how the spirit is praise the Lord Jesus it's a mystery you know I preached I preached this several years ago about the kingdom of God had PowerPoint presentation and and and all of that you can go back and listen to it but it really is astounded me and it was striking to me amen how simple the kingdom of God really is because we make it seem to be like it's something mysterious and and but yet in reality it's simple the Simplicity of Christ amen is sometimes so easy for us to to to to let go of amen of how simple of how simple Christ is amen now we know that the holy spirit amen the kingdom of God is the Holy Ghost and so how is it that the kingdom of God can't can't be detected by visible signs amen we look at the Bible amen at examples for example the Sun the moon the stars amen they have routines amen they they come up in the morning or they come up at night and they're there for a purpose according to Genesis chapter 1. amen they are there to for Seasons to give light a man for times for dates amen they have a purpose but yet we see them every day and it just seems like it's ho-hum and oh there's the moon again but the moon has a powerful purpose we don't know all of that that the moon does there's there's there's things about there's mysteries about the Moon that we don't know of and and scientists and NASA amen they still scratch their head about or even what the moon is made of made out of certainly not made out of cheese I can tell you that but it all has a purpose amen how about the cells in our body the cells that that form in our body amen all have a purpose even though we don't see them move remember we're talking about this Kingdom we don't see it move we don't see visible signs but yet the same thing with cells we don't see visible signs of yourselves amen but if we took a Suave a man of DNA or something like that there'll be cells right there and you put that in a Petri dish and and then they'll they'll start replicating and and those cells amen they're replicating in your body and they're forming amen your fingers they're forming your tongue they're forming different parts of your body I mean they're doing things in a mundane type of way you don't see them moving you don't you don't see them forming you don't see you don't see them but they're doing something yeah amen they're doing something the animal life take a look by the way deals with the honeybees amen how are we going to be able to enjoy that that wonderful sweet nectar or that honey that we enjoy and we put on our pancakes in the morning we put in our coffee but yet uh the honeybees day in day out they're doing what they're doing amen and it's producing that honey you don't see it unless you open up their their their their beehives you see what's going on but other than that you don't see what's happening and yet it's producing great things it's the same thing with God Saints amen sometimes we see we we don't see God why I don't see I don't feel you I I I I I don't sense that that you're near amen but I promise you he said that he would be with us even in US amen and something's happening if your desire is to see more of God because because God will you wouldn't have that desire in you if if if if if God wasn't moving in your life praise the Lord amen so oftentimes um in the Bible before there were great we read the stories in the Bible before there were great dramatic events that took place amen there was a time of mundane routine just right before those those times you take Noah for example he preached 120 years day in day out building the ark and and probably people just got tired of listening to Noah's voice of repenting and of of it's going to rain and all these all these things that he was trying to say that he was trying to tell the people that God told him to let the people know for a hundred and twenty years but it produced an ark and It produced The Flood It produced a great dramatic event but it took the whole hum routine of hammering away of sawing amen of preaching of studying of praying it took all those things and one day God did what he said to Noah that he was going to do so before the the the the the dramatic event amen the mundane had to take place amen we take for example Abraham receiving the the promised son he maybe thought that he was going to receive that blessing right there and then but then one one year went by two years went by three years went by 25 years went by and he was still waiting for that promised son wondering with Sarah where is he but he came Sarah got pregnant she received that son amen and the and the and and so that that event they meant culminated amen but it had to take it had to First the mundane had to take place first amen praise the Lord Jesus Moses at the Red Sea Crossing amen we can use that as well amen 40 years he was being prepped in the desert before he could go and take the people and cross over the promised land I'm into the to Across the Red Sea amen the walls of Jericho that's another seven days amen just mundane just marching around going to church and opening my Bible and it was mundane but the walls fell amen the walls eventually fell praise God so I want you to understand this Saints I want you I want you to get this that the mundane the the dramatic events that we read in the scriptures they were not it's not the drum the actual climax of those events that we learned the lessons from that it's not the actual great dramatic climax though where we actually get the lesson it's what happened before that where we actually received the lessons that we need in our life amen because God was working on all these individuals before the dramatic event took place before no before the rain came amen God was working in Noah 120 years you don't think that Noah sometimes felt depressed and felt unsure and and and and and and and and wondering if he was really in the will of God or not why did I really hear from God and yet God is dealing with Noah and something is sparking in Noah's heart amen that is that is causing him to continue to preach for 120 years what about Abraham some things was working in Abraham God was working in Abraham amen dealing with his faith as he was waiting for that promise that God would had made to him amen same thing with Moses amen Moses had to have Egypt taken out of him before he could actually go and rescue them from Egypt the children of Israel you see so God is dealing with all these personalities amen and that's the same thing with you and I Saints it's not the dramatic events in our life and it's not a uh the the the the uh all the the the the trips to Bali and to into Italy if I could just make it to that trip of Italy amen I know I'll be happy in life that that vacation that I've always wanted to take down in Florida or or wherever I'll be happy I'll have joy or that car that you've always wanted or whatever I I know oh man when I can get a hold of that SUV or that car I know I'll be happy I mean if I'm I can pay for it and everything I I'll just be I'll be happy I've reached it then yeah it's not it's not that amen but it's what's God doing behind the scenes amen that causes the joy of the Lord amen in your life praise God praise the Lord Jesus so in life there there's times that we have times of quiet and peace and Times of loudness and drama what if every day was was dramatic in your life I don't know some of us could make it if it was like the The Barking Chihuahuas that I spoke about last time when I was preaching just constantly around you just barking barking barking barking drama in your life I mean you'd probably just some of us probably have that already but and God bless you you helped me to know what what the secret is to make it you know not that I have drama in life but sometimes it feels that way amen but what if everything was like that well let's just take it the other way what if every time every every time it was always just quiet and you didn't even hear a fly flying around you nothing what if it was always like that you'd want something different right but that's why God has given us these this balance of highs and and lows amen you need a balance of both and then but and in those situations amen God is molding our character praise God because because maybe God maybe you've you've had a week last week that it was dramatic I mean you got you know someone just ran right across and you they're at a red light and almost caused an accident and you slam on the brakes and fell over uh and landed up in a ditch but you missed that car and it made you nervous and I mean and you thought about that for the rest of the week I mean it was some drama in your life that day right and then this week it's just a total opposite nothing quiet peaceful you're enjoying that because you had that previous drama from last week right but what if God is actually sometimes in those ho-hum daily routines of life and and and and and and and these things that we're talking about what if God is just preparing you for something else that's getting ready to come and he needs you to quiet down settle down because he knows that something some more drama is going to come your way amen did you see how God does things and so we don't have to take it as oh my gosh what what are you doing I mean amen that's the balance of life we all need it now I think our young people too Amen in some way especially as teenagers when they're growing and they have these highs and these lows and there's all these changes the changes that are taking place why am I feeling this way but but then I feel depressed but then I feel so excited and and I just can't seem to get to bed and and I you know but then I'm I don't even want to be around my mom and dad and I don't and then but us as parents we think that's bothersome I'm getting down to the parents now because remember I'm still a parent and I'm dealing with I'm dealing with raising teenagers right now they need those those things they need those ups and those Downs because it's going to bring balance in their life amen because God is God is dealing with him you have to remember God gave them to you so that you can put give them back to him and that's what's happening amen don't don't get upset at them and scold them amen because they're they're thinking you they're thinking a certain way why in the where would you do that they're gonna make some dumb mistakes trust me they're gonna say some dumb things too they're gonna they're gonna I mean but I read scientifically their their brains are still are still being formed all the way up to the ages of 25. scientifically it's been proven so there from a baby down to 25 years up to 25 years old their brains are still formed so I don't know all the details of that you can go into 100 and research that but that to me that changed a lot of the way I think about how to deal with teenagers amen or young people see because it's not just a spiritual thing with them amen it's also a psychological thing or also a biological thing things are happening in their bodies you see that you went through nobody explained that to you but you think that they're ridiculous for acting the way you used to act Bridge that's the same way you used to act but you think it's ridiculous because your brain has already developed you're 40 50 60 years old and that's why we don't give these kids a chance praise God and you say Lord give me wisdom to be able to deal with my children the way you would do it to be the right parent the right father the right mother let me say the right things that would invite them to to come closer to you they may not do it right there and then but I promise you amen they're seeing and they're and they're they're they're they're taking these things in of the things that you do or don't do or say or don't say many times I've made mistakes I haven't said the right thing I haven't done the right thing but oftentimes I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm surprised that sometimes things that my daughters would tell me that they observed and I had no idea and I'm like you know what Lord thank you that you allowed me to do that so that they could see that amen so always be salty not just at church not just when you go to work but always be salty even before your children be salted before your your cousins be salted before your your everybody around you amen I know it's tough because we're living this mundane routine life I gotta get up in the morning and go to work and I don't feel like shaking people's hand at church I'm not already thinking about work tomorrow or about going to school I got to do homework and I just don't feel like it you know what there's many times that Jesus didn't feel like doing many things either but yet it's not about you it's about what you can do for others and how others can feel amen the the the things that you that the Impressions that you're making in people's lives amen so uh what so what what about these things that are they're leading up to to those moments amen the daily life what about those things because you're thinking you're thinking oh when I get that car when I finally find the right person to marry I'll just be happy and I'll find joy in that and that's very joyous and that's very a very happy thing but those of us that are married can say that's not fulfillment it fulfills but it's not the full fulfillment without Christ being in the picture it's a very happy thing it's a wonderful thing it's it's a it's a blessed thing but it's not the thing amen because things come and go amen but the joy of the Lord is our strength praise God so the bad times can happen and you got the joy of the Lord but the good times can happen and you got the same joy of the Lord you're settled in truth amen you're you're you're you're you're nothing nothing can move you because truth is what you're settled upon amen and that's what God I believe is trying to deal with us in this hour amen so how do we find the Lord in in the mundane and how do we find joy in the ordinary how do we find joy in in me scraping off the blueberries that dry blueberries off the off the the that bowl then my husband left the night before and he was eating blueberry pie and he just he forgot to put the the Water Rinse the bowl with water and and at least do that no he just put it there and then now it's all dried up and nasty don't you hate that and the sisters say [Laughter] hey man I hate that but but instead of you complaining I mean I'm just being practical you know that's just just I am instead of you complaining what about thinking okay I am doing this amen so that he can I'm blessing I'm going through this so that he can use that same Bowl again and it'll bless him to be able to use that same bowl for his cereal or for his pasta and he might do that again he'll just leave it in the dish in the sink and not rinse it out or anything like that but you know what I'm doing it for him I I'm living my life I'm I'm suffering for him because I love him I love him I I want you to look look what this uh this this really struck me this this quote by Mother Teresa you can think about whatever you think about Mother Teresa but this really struck me she said this she said wash the plate not because it's dirty nor because you're told to wash it but because you love the person who use it next I think to me that's striking I think if if we think that way that'll help us complain less about the chores that we have to do especially us as uh you know the younger ones have oftentimes told my my daughters that when you have to do something the Bible tells us to do it as unto the Lord right so if your husband has the Holy Ghost you're washing that dish you're doing it as unto the Lord because that is God walking around your house isn't it or how about the the brother amen you're fixing that deck for your wife my wife is looking at me like I don't want to do it but I'm doing it not really for myself but I know I got to do it but she wants to see a pretty deck she wants to say I'm doing it to please the Lord that that side of the Lord you see that I believe my wife has the Holy Ghost so I'm doing it for the Lord because that's what the Bible tells me to do right it'll help us less complaining and less grumbling amen and every time you fold that shirt every time you you you separate socks and you're trying to find the right sock after you do laundry and and all these different socks and I just can't find where's my other soccer and you end up and you had dropped it down there all the way down in the basement and you could you got to go pick it up and to pair it with this one amen but instead of complaining and grumbling and and thinking oh he's got I'm doing it as unto the Lord I'm doing it because I love my husband I'm doing it because I love my wife and I want him or I want my children to to have a pair of clean socks I want Jesus to have a pair of clean socks I think about it that way it makes us think things a little differently right so I thought that that was real striking that that quote amen don't do it don't watch the plate not because it's dirty not because you're told to wash it but because you love the person who use it next Colossians 3 23 tells us and whatsoever ye do do it heartily as of to the Lord yeah I fell in this many times sometimes we lose our vision about things and maybe things that we do here at church and we failed we failed to to to to to grab the whole picture and we think that it's just about that that shows us that the selfish selfishness sometimes in US amen do it heartily as unto the Lord heartily knowing that the Lord knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of The Inheritance and what is the inheritance is this Kingdom amen you will receive the benefits of the Holy Spirit you receive the bad that's the benefits of that Kingdom and folding some dirty clothes and some clean clothes and washing clothes and yeah because now you're doing you're thinking about the person and you're not thinking about the task you see praise God Amen hmm so this this should transform amen the way we we view our daily chores and and and it should challenge our perspective of of how we do things amen that's what I'm trying to do amen because sometimes we get caught up on hung up on on everything that I'm doing amen and and if any wanting is is noticing and no one notices what I'm doing but yet amen I read this verse I read this quote amen and it changes my perspective praise God that's one of the reasons why God put it there amen because it's not about you it's about God it's about the Lord amen so real quick amen I said I wasn't going to keep you guys but how to ensure you are manifesting the kingdom in every moment whether dull or exciting times amen three things amen we can handle three things right amen praise the Lord make sure that you are established in the truth amen make sure that that that that you are always involved in around truth and in this case it's the truth amen praise the Lord because that will help you and those that will help you during those times as I said earlier amen when things are not going right and or things are just normal every day type of I've got to go to do this that and then I know that amen that'll help you to always have a song in your heart amen always praising the Lord in your in your heart amen David said the joy of the Lord is my strength praise the Lord Jesus amen number two in mundane moments you see what the Lord wants you to learn or practice amen because patience contentment steadfastness Joy all these different things are not practiced in happy moments and dramatic type of events they're practicing the mundane routine daily type in and go in and out that's when those things are practiced that's when you can learn patience more and sometimes yeah we need you know a brother or sister says something to you amen and it just I want to say something back to them so bad that was a dramatic moment there's a moment of learning some patience there amen remember we're scaling up this this this this this this uh mountain right here praise God but it's in those times and you say Lord in those Quiet Moments you say Lord what is it that you're trying to teach me I I see nothing's going on in my life I'm just I'm going to work I'm coming home and what is it that you're trying to teach me praise God and number three amen work work because the Lord said so work do something be active maybe you stay busy amen find something to do because if you don't that's when the Satan comes in that's when the devil gets in he loves boredom oh he loves the board mind young people find something that that can grab your mind so that you're not in you know leaning over to the things of the world Amen but when you're when you have your mind busy on on things I'm not necessarily saying that you always have to sit and read your Bible amen find definitely find times to do that do it daily amen but do something Amen to keep your mind busy amen you know we're in the age of AI uh artificial intelligence for those who don't know then the next Gadget then and the artificial intelligence are trying to make us to work less and have more leisure have more Leisure and work less in reality we God asked us to work God asked us to use our brain God asked us amen but see all these other things are making us dumber and dumber and dumber and we don't even realize AI is heading the same direction as well now there's there's ways that AI can help I know that amen and they're trying to figure out I'm in at the school district where I work at they're trying to figure out because how can AI benefit the the children at school you know artificial and chat GTP and all these things where it's not just giving them answers or where it's not just amen but how can we use that that technology meant to actually help them to to know Amen to learn but you're not really honestly you're not going to win you're not gonna do uh there's nothing better than actually having one-on-one a teacher and some classroom and some and some and some classmates I mean that's the best that's what that's how God created us amen God didn't make us you know as as robots and and half human and half real but that's not God's intention that's the world's intention for us amen you you want to know what the world thinks of us or how they want us to be just go watch that movie from Disney that came out several years ago called Wally that's how they're trying to make us to be sitting around in chairs and just getting big and fat and Sassy and and with a screen right here in front of you and and it just does everything robots are doing everything for you and you're just sitting there and I mean you just go back and watch that movie they foretold exactly what they what they're thinking about today I wonder how anyways I'll get down to that but it is exactly what what they want for for you and me but that's not what God how God originally intended us to be so that's why the me personally I fight those things because it's not in in alignment with the word of God it's not in alignment with God's original thought amen it's great to have technology and to have but I'm not going to wear it all over me and I'm not going to have you know that's just not me because I like the original I like the original and if I can get more toward their original I just better for me anyways so make sure you're busy amen make sure you're busy so that the mundane amen doesn't seem so mundane praise the Lord Jesus brother Brown says this then our headship is a kingdom the kingdom of God is within you said the Bible Jesus the kingdom we are not a denomination we belong to a kingdom and the kingdom is the word of God made spirit and life in our own life amen praise the Lord Jesus that's the kingdom that's the the kingdom amen wants to be alive and active in your life amen even in the everyday ho-hum uh ways of life God already took up his Abode potentially the kingdom of God is in the earth now in the hearts of his Saints brother Branham says it's his attributes that he began in the beginning now his attributes is redeemed you and I amen what's he waiting to redeem the Earth to set his attributes on it to fulfill exactly his predestinated plan praise the Lord so God is working and and building the kingdom in you so that one day you can fully rule over this Kingdom this Earth with character because power without character is what satanic so if character is not be informed in You Now by the Holy Ghost through the mundane type of things that you go through every day amen you're not going to be able to rule there do you see what I'm saying that's why you need the ups and downs now because there it'll always be highs but you've already have gone through all the ups and downs and it'll just be worth it all then amen praise the Lord amen so Zachariah tells us and we're finishing with this amen Zechariah 4 tells us then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit said the Lord of hosts amen who art thou great Mountain before zerubbabel Thou shalt become a plane and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace amen I always like to say double Grace amen through through our ups and downs amen God is molding these virtues in our heart in our life amen through our mundane tasks of life it didn't take a shouting service to to give you knowledge and then take a a a a a a a shouting service to give you patience or it didn't take for a brother to just lay hands on you amen and you get godliness no it's through the daily routines of come in the church going to work dealing with people talking to people dealing with my wife dealing with my with my daughters dealing with your children cleaning dirty diapers amen folding the clothes amen doing all of that that's how you get all of it it's in the mundane things so we need those mundane things but you have you make the best of them why the joy of the Lord is my strength and to mundane and the mundane routine things you know the things in life think really the things of this of this life it's all about mundane routines and and repetitions nothing that's what Jesus that's what the Bible says that he is the same yesterday today and forever and that formula right there makes great things happen he never changes amen so we don't always need to be see or see dramatic changes in things in our life amen be get well acquainted with the mundane of your life of the of the and see and say Lord how can I reflect the kingdom of God in this that I'm doing because I just don't see it but help me to see it Lord I believe he'll he'll teach you amen God bless you Saints amen let's send to our feet praise the Lord amen let's just sing uh let's say I want to live the way
