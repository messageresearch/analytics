I guess the yard know that just to make sure that you uh pray for him do you pray for these preachers my brother Nell announces you pray for that person to to speak to you and then they've got to labor a couple of days to get a sermon to speak to you all right so we need to pray every time we have ministers come up here in priests because it's not a man it's not a man it's a message so we had a good youth service last Sunday thank you everyone that stayed thanks brother Dale forgetting the pizza for us and we had some good questions and good answers and I believe it helped them helped you thank you for some of you older kids that stayed and helped out and and it's and they kind of sneak in the back sit down and listen to what's going on so that's all right so but god bless you today we're going to for the umpteenth million time you ladies need to meet in the middle room after service to figure out what color the flowers are then the flower garden he was gonna wash the windows who's gonna clean the rocks in the front yard we're gonna meet for the first time today though men for next weekend so we need to me to my Sunday School class if you're going it doesn't matter even if

kids sit up front because it is a youth service and brother Andrews really good with the youth and he's a good brother anyway good brother in Lawrence so let's turn about turning your Bibles to back to Corinthians we're going to finish up with extra today I've enjoyed it more this time I guess then time before somebody mentioned the other days that well you brought out a lot more than it did before I hope that there's more being brought out every time my brother Dale has been over about five different subjects 20 different times but you get something new every time so then you know what that does that doesn't make it old that doesn't make a stale that doesn't make it mundane that makes it a revelation that you go I didn't see them so you get that I believe that's God telling you you're on the right path if you get something and it helps you in your life and helps you in your spiritual walk then then that's God showing you till that gives you that little spiritual boost just like it would a good food or some vitamins or a good drink of water after working for a long period of time it's just kind of rejuvenation and it makes you stronger so we want to be stronger Christians absolutely amen so god bless you like I said before everything's back to normal but as normal as it can be so we're still going to hand sanitize and we're still gonna make sure if you're coughing or if you're sick don't come to church if you do want to wear masks like I said before brother Dale said before our sit downstairs there's monitors both monitors are on in my son's coop class and in the middle class or the middle room for you to enjoy the service and we want you to enjoy the service because listen there's not a lot of joy out there it's just people beating each other killing each other shooting each other and don't know what to do and it's just not bothered me you know I mean you don't it shouldn't bother a Christian it should tell us that we have now these markers that we as we spoke years ago about these markers of different dates we see that if you would pray you next Sunday probably if I get finished today next Sunday we're gonna start on the feast days in the Bible all right but remember this those are what those are for our example like we're gonna read here we don't we don't take two weeks off or one week off for the Feast of Tabernacles we don't take you understand one of them we're not Jewish to that degree maybe we should so both got three coming up pretty quick here in September so um but anyway I'm just I'm just kidding but we are spiritually God gave that feast and every application of that for me and you the killing of the animals the washing of this the eating of the unleavened bread sure that was something they had to go by that was works but see by grace were saved through faith as brother Dale was talking about so we look at these things and we see that we there's a spiritual application and I want you to be praying about this and remember this is the importance that I'm gonna put on it is that the feast days were to Israel there was four in the spring and three in the fall everybody got that those of you Bible readers you know that there was four in the spring and three in the fall all right there was Passover unleavened bread firstfruits and the feast of Pentecost then you had a long period of time and this year on May the 31st was the feast of Pentecost and it was on a Sunday all right so now we've got now coming up you've got the Feast of Trumpets which is September the 19th what day is I September nineteen Tennessee birthday a little mercy we'll hear about that nevermind Davis Day of Atonement September the 28th and the Feast of Tabernacles will be October the 2nd through the night so we got those Springs I mean those fall fee coming up and remember one thing Jesus this is I want what you didn't want you to mull this around your head Jesus fulfilled the first four he was killed on Passover he was part of the unleavened bread he stayed in the grave he was the firstfruits that came up out of the grave and obviously he was the big deal on the feast of Pentecost because on that very day he came back into the people but now you've got this long period of time that Jesus is not only earth but he's in his people so the Feast of Tabernacles the Feast of Trumpets the feast the Day of Atonement and Feast of Tabernacles you and I have to fulfill and Christ does it through us in these fall feasts that's why I love the fall of the year being that it is a time of harvest all right so god bless you let's pray just keep those things in your heart we're coming up on a time that we're gonna go home we're getting out of here they can have this world they have whatever but you know what we're gonna see just in a minute how that the king gave Esther all of Haman's property when the devil is destroyed he's gonna give us all the devil's property you say oh yeah yeah cuz remember this is he's a squatter and he's on squatter but when this thing becomes God on the outside the devil's been destroyed and we have retook our possession and he's not a squad rennie more so this is what we're looking at today but we're gonna start I'm gonna comment on Esther chapter five just for a minute then we're going to go back to Esther chapter eight let's bow our heads the only father we thank you for the word Lord that you give us we pray now that you're sanctified Lord in the speaking and in the hearing Lord that we'll take today Lord and ponder these things in our heart is many have have done over the centuries of time they've listen to sermons they've listened to many things Lord but now we've come to the end where we're we're at a position Lord where the sermons are getting smaller and smaller we're heading toward that end time to where we're going to have a joyous feast and we're going to be able to step over into eternity and father will be there Lord with you like you've always wanted but Lord we've got a journey now that we've got to continue in as Esther did and as the different ones of Abram to Abraham and Sarah - Sarah and Ruth all the way through to having the promised son lord I pray that you just be with us Lord take care of us at the church be with our pastor bless him Lord keep him strong keep us all safe and be with us Lord in the further 'men of this service blessed Lord the missionaries on the foreign fields we see now there's not many out there because of this virus thing Lord you there's there's a lot of people having to do on their own which is which that's the way it should be Lord we should get this thing as an individual affair with you Lord and then you will speak to us you promised you would father we pray that you'd bless us now take care of us in Jesus name Amen yeah you there's just not a lot of movement going on and in the foreign fields because nobody can get over there but you know what God knew it he already sent him some he already sent him some information he given the internet he gave them live streaming and all these different things so I'm not worried about the true bride the true bride we'll make it through I said the true bride now remember because Israel's not all Israel and every person that came up on the feast of Passover and through the lamb up on the upon the altar didn't get their sins forgiven because guarding you the heart but now some people did and I believe they did it humble and they did it crying and confessing their sins just like you and I and they got their sins forgiven on the day of Passover when they killed the lamb so god bless you let's just read the last one verse 11 now all these things happened unto them for examples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come you may be seated in the Laurinaitis blessing to the reading of the word but here in the book of Esther we see that extra starts as a nothing little girl and now Esther's leaving the building bad timing start talking about him and they walk out the door she won't be back for a while to get her face from being super here but you get up and start talking by the Esther and then she get some walks out the door but this little girl started from nothing and now she's a queen now she has a little bit of pull with the King why because in Chapter five Esther comes to a place to where Astra knows if she doesn't go into the king that her people are gonna perish amen and listen as we were talking downstairs this morning revelations chapter one through three shows the bride of Jesus Christ on earth and anybody listen to this I want you to get this anyone from that day of Pentecost on the fiftieth day after the after the Passover on the fiftieth day there was a feast of Pentecost and Jesus Christ actually came back into the believers now from that point forward every person get this that's why the bride is so important Jesus is not on the scene right Jesus is not physically here but on the day of Pentecost he comes into a hundred and twenty people burst them into the body makes them the bride and everything after that that's going to make it to heaven whether it be bride whether it be foolish virgin whether it be cup of water in my name has all got to come from that think about that revelations one through three is talking about the bride on the earth her character oh yeah she messes up every once in a while but everything for two thousand years since Jesus died and came back on the day of Pentecost everything has been about the bride that's how important you are that's how important and then the more the more important it is we're the only ones left alive everybody else is in another dimension there's the first a second third fourth fifth most of the seventh it's already in that sixth dimension waiting on a group of people not waiting all the denomination's not waiting on the Pope not waiting on politics but waiting on menu that's how important Esther was Esther said if I die I die but I'm going in to the king because I've got some people I got some people there are left out here then I need to get in I need for them to at least be able to defend their self because they had no hope without Esther read your Bible they had no hope because he had already Haman had already made his Proclamation the King had already signed it we're going to see here in just a minute that the King made a decree and couldn't take it back you know we're going to see here in just a minute God made a decree and couldn't take it back in Genesis in Genesis 3 he said because of what you've done death will take you to the ground ashes to ashes dust to dust in other words God said there's nothing I can do about what I said because in Genesis 3 all that when the fall happened God couldn't go back he said the day you eat thereof that day you die that's the same way wasn't when hey got the King to write the decree to kill the Jews which he didn't know who it was in there in the natural story they were just gonna die there was going to be a day when this king with this great army he didn't have like two people he had like two million people in the army all over the country they were just going to go in and kill all the Jews same way was saying don't you think Satan under that Pentecost he's trying to figure out what yep I got a 120 to deal with now huh and now I got more to deal with and now I got more to deal with and now he's in the end time going I'll get him he's persistent he's been waiting 2000 years he said I'll get them and then the Lord's going hang on a minute because I have made a provision we're going to read it here but what happens in chapter 5 is she tells him she brings Haman in and Haman remember we were talking about last Sunday Haman comes in and Haman is pre-select guy but whatever Haman did the King turned it right around same way with God God's gonna say alright devil you caused all this I mean you you you you're the one that went into the garden and you're the one that that made this but it didn't mess my plan up I knew you were gonna do that the day I made you I knew you were gonna do that I knew you were gonna make you fall I knew you were gonna do all this and I knew that death was gonna rain for 2,000 years and God's just hanging on he's just waiting but there's somebody got to come up like Esther because watch here in just a minute when we get into chapter 8 she devises a plan because she knows one thing for sure she's already made the petition we know one thing's for sure that that there in Chapter seven that at that banquet that Haman was destroyed and hung on his own gala he made the gal oh he was gonna hang Mordecai on it all right and he thought for a moment he was gonna be the pace she's back now we can talk about her again she's good okay you face it they're red so Heyman says man you know I'm gonna make my own bride I'm gonna be my own man I'm gonna ban I'm gonna make God happy hmm so the king says who's worthy to wear my crown and wear my jewels and put him on a horse and he says all while the great man that that you know got you out of trouble and all this stuff and and the devil's going I got you buddy you're just nice right where you're at aren't you comfortable but that day the exact black got borning in Heyman had to put him on the horse and put the crown on his head and the Royal jewels on his finger and had to parade him through the crowd and he liked it did he so he started again but we know the devil he does have an end but in that wonderful though however and listen everything my brother Dale said this morning even your sickness we don't want to glorify the devil and God doesn't just throw things on you on purpose he knows what you need when you need it amen so he puts a little something he moves you over you know there's some things going on in in my life and my body not my life but my body that I'm having to deal with some things but you know why it's gonna do it's gonna make it to where I'm not looking this way anymore hey you know it's none of your business whatever it is but I'm telling you how what does God do to you same thing you think I'm good no that's not good let me go this way but that's the way it is with God but you listen you pay a 10 - what he's saying to you because he's the one remember God's nose or the best yes you ever get because you ask something you ask something even brother Brown said you can press right brother Brown said I can press God and get what I want but it would be permissive will and there might be a problem but the perfect will of God is when he says no you just go okay I thought that was right you know what God says that's what you get for thinking he said let me do the thinking because remember this knowledge right here is not the knowledge of man it's the knowledge of God so we see this in extras life she's using sure in the story she's using regular knowledge but don't you think one thing's for sure if she's given to us just like Abraham's just like Abraham just like Ruth they were guided by God because if their life didn't turn out that way God couldn't wrote it in the Bible so that me and you can go down the right path so that me and you could do the right thing when something happens in your life you have adversity in your life and you have something going on you say well that happened to Ruth well that happened to Esther and you see what they did to overcome it because here's Esther she comes and makes that petition and the King says sorry I've wrote what I wrote the day you eat thereof that day you die I cannot take that back because I'm a judge and I'm a righteous judge and I judge sin and you send in Genesis 3 and we were born in sin shaping the iniquity nothing we can do about that you cannot reverse your first birth remember what we remember what Nicodemus nickname was like would I need to go rule did I need to reverse my first birth Jesus said mm-hmm that's the one that's killing you you need to be born from above in other words you need to have a way out so where's the way out jesus said I am the way the truth and the life the King had to come on the scene and the King couldn't change his word but he used it to kill the devil and he used it to save you just like we're gonna see right here in Chapter eight so let's go to chapter eight and let's begin right here now remember this is right after Haman was hung on the gallows that he had made listen Satan is going to be hung by his own word by your words you shall be justified by your words you shall be condemned alright Chapter eight here we are in Chapter eight does eight have any okay we don't see the devil after Chapter eight we're after Chapter seven because when you're in eternity the devil is not there remember that and get this that's why you don't see the devil he's not eternal and he can't become eternal because he's already made his choice and he's already shut itself off because of iniquity I was terrible we were talking about downstairs you know Satan was made perfect God can't make anything imperfect he can't make the devil be evil but the devil in his own choosing chose to be that way he wanted her what a higher place and listen that's what Haman wanted Haman just didn't want to get rid of Mordecai people this is that I mean that's the story Haman just didn't want to get rid of Mordecai but Mordecai was the one standing in his way so he could sit on that throne or be the total right-hand man that's why he had to get rid of Mordecai but we see that he didn't so chapter eight let's begin reading around here on that day did the king of source give the house of Haman the Jews enemy under Esther the Queen what the Bible tell us were airs enjoin airs we are priests and kings remember there is a quote brother that was this morning you have to rip be careful there is quotes where brother branham would say something you go man and then he make another quote because brother Brown will say Satan is the air of the earth well he's really not he's a squatter cuz brother Brown comes over and he says no he's a squatter he's just there squatting on your land so he's a squatter so what has he done the King gives everything because remember where we gonna rule and reign and what are we gonna rule it right over this earth is ours it was Adams to begin with remember God said I'll take care of the heaven you take care of the earth Hanna well the second Adam come back to give us control and to give us back our possession but he's gotta save this earth first then when this earth gets saved it'll go right straight over like we were talking about this morning we'll just step over it'll just be like that Kikaider you'll look one day and you'll say man I'm new Abraham woke up one morning he said we're that old guy go there was a question this morning whether that would be a gradual process I don't believe so the Bible says will be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye you know you get something in your eye you really don't miss a lot but by that time you do that then everybody's changed and that's the way God is but he turns around and gives everything that Haman had to ask to the Queen they didn't give it to Mordecai because Mordecai's got a position if Mordecai is our little man our prophet of the hour okay God can't give all the promises to one man it's his bride first now we know brother listen we know brother Brown was part of the bride so he gets it too but he's not but God just didn't say all right I'm giving it all the way in Brenham and then he's nowhere to be seen because he's gone off the scene and here we are with nothing no that's not the way God works that's not the way any story in the Bible begins our ends with giving it to one man he's giving it to what yeah he's giving it to asked her but after tops the bride he's giving it to John on the Isle of Patmos who does John top the entire bride me and you when I say bride you should say me so he gave all the possessions of Haman to Esther the Queen and Mordecai came before the king for Esther had told what he was unto her amen so we got we got to put this little man back in here because he's he's oneness he's a little bit smarter than Esther okay at the time because he's out here Esther's in the court he's out here watching the world profit profit prophetic he hears all these different things that's going on he hears the two men he just happens to be in the right place when the two murderers are getting ready no he's in a position like brother Branham was standing he said okay I'm going to cause I'm gonna send my profit across the curtain of time brother Branham goes across the curtain of time he comes back tells who us what to look for all the different things in his life he's telling it as an example never pointing his finger to itself but to a bride and that's more to cause Commission Mordecai didn't walk up and say now kid wait a minute you give Esther all that house to Haman and I'm the one who told you to he's not that way that's not the character that man that wasn't a character William man Branham either but watch the King took off his ring which he had taken from Haman and he didn't give it to Esther he gave it to Mordecai why did he give it to Mordecai Mordecai was one that had like I said before had the knowledge of the prophecy he was outside he was watching everything that was going on so the king you say what is that brother way brother Brown came to adoption before anybody else death oh that's your signet right we know Esther had power with the King because she she went into I mean she was part of them in the bed you understand what I mean the secret things were told to Esther but the secret things of the outside world brother Branham would go somewhere and he would come back and tell us these different things that were going on in the world he's telling her he told us 50 years ago what's happening now pretty much okay so that's what Mordecai yes he gave the Rings in other words he gives authority to brother Branham to tell us what to do and Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman and Esther Speight yet again before the king now remember she'd already talked to him one time about reversing this thing he said I can't reverse it but watch what she does and Esther spate yet again before the king and fell down at his feet and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the a guy and his device that he had devised against the Jews how many of you know what the characteristic of having the baptism of the Holy Ghost is brother Brown said you cry and sigh you go to the king and make a petition because listen the only way some believe this the only way somebody's gonna get a new birth is if you tell them about it not some radio program you wife comes through the body of Christ that makes you important you know why cause God chose you to do that you didn't use yourself God chose you to do that the team sets you in place and nobody can take your place I broke my heart when you see that she'd be salt with tears to save my how many of us do that there's a wall right here below me full of names some of them has power some of them have not right here people we wanted it right here what was right underneath this pulpit if you don't know what I'm talking about going my Sunday School class and look at this wall of people your friends your family your husband's your wife your children your neighbors we put their names and some of them the pictures up so that we know personally who they are that's what extra was doing actually was saying King these people are gonna die my people are gonna die if you don't do something he says that King changed my word but watch what happens so the King held out the golden scepter toward after why he couldn't do anything he don't kill her he loves her so extra arose and stood before the king and said if it pleases the King now watch this this is Esther and I have found favor in his sight and the thing seems right before the King and I'll be pleasing in his eyes let it be written to reverse the letter devised by Haman the son of all that which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the Kings promises for how can I endure to see the evil that still coming to my people in other words like I said before sigh and cry sigh and cry we need to sign cry for our people it's getting late how many of you went into the king and say King I need to talk to you for a minute yeah for how can I endure to see the evil they should coming to my people or how can I endure the see the destruction of my kindred now watch this then the king of source set into extra the Queen and two more to college you behold I have given s to the house of Haman and him they have hanged on the gallows because he laid his hands upon the Jews right you also for the Jews as it like us you in the King's name in you write it you write it I'll back it up right you also for the Jews as it like a--the you in the King's name and seal it with the King's ring for the writing which is written in the King's name and sealed with the King's ring may no man reverse listen there was nobody change sure it was laying all in the scripture it was laying in the Word of God but no one was able to preach it until Mordecai comes on this thing until our little profit that comes in and broke themselves open I don't understand how in the heavenly days nice thing about this other day how in the world where we gonna know what those seals were what the trumpets were what the vowels were what the what the all the different ones all the thunders are not we need somebody else to come if he were uh the Rams not the one when he needs to come in a hurry but we don't believe that you know that we believe he's already come our Mordecai's already cup wrote us eleven hundred and something letters put them in all different languages sent him all over the world yeah and put the king seal on it because when the sails were broke that was a king seal Rocchi also for the jews has it like it to you in the King's name and seal it with the king's ring for the writings which is written in the King named in other words look this book killed you sealed with seven seals remember they were scrolled rolled up sealed this thing kills you but what happened in 1963 the seals were broke and the true letter not that the other ones were false all they knew is what they knew but remember brother M said a what light shining on this yet the light that was shining on this came with a king seal I can't change this but I can write it in there in secret I can put that love letter in there where you can finally after Mordechai comes and gives you a little knowledge and by the Holy Ghost that we have now guess what I'm gonna give you a way to defend yourself I can't reverse what I said because listen he can't so reverse itself even in the Millenium because people go it's got to be a thousand years and then after that all the centers are gonna die you see what I'm saying so this thing continues on but not for us not for astronaut for Mordecai because there's something coming there's something that's been written then where the King scribes called at that time in the third month how about that that is the month Saban on the three and twentieth day thereof and it was written according to all that Mordechai preached to the Jews hey the Kings not writing this at the time he's writing it instead of in his stead don't remember he's got the authority Mordecai the Jew in other words more two kinds of Christian Esther's a Christian he knows how they act he knows what they need so what'd he do and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded them to the Jews now look he can't reverse what the king said he can't write a new Bible but he can take what's already written in this Bible and help you defend yourself was written according to all that Mordecai commanders of the Jews and to the lieutenant's and the deputies and rulers of the provinces works from India to Ethiopia look that up on the map 127 provinces under every province according to the writing thereof and to other people after I had to write in different languages we had to get this message out in different languages and to the Jews according to their writing and according to their language and he wrote in the King a sources name and sealed it with the king's ring and sent messages all over the world my muse camos dromedaries tape players mp3 we're in the King granted the Jews which were in every city to congregate together where the carcass is there were the Eagles to be gathered wearing the King granted the Jews which were never seated together the self together and to stand that's what you're doing today brothers and sisters you're standing for your life I like Brett what brother when the ropes used to say ease as I rest my soul on Malakoff bow but not just the person Malka for not the Mordecai it's what he wrote remember and the power that was behind it because remember brother Brahma can't change the Bible but when he took that seal and put it on them eleven hundred something sermons and we get a revelation that that's how we're supposed to get it it don't change the Bible but it sure helped us defend ourselves hello every day you do that you defend yourself by the Word of God the devil says I got you you go like you don't know cuz you know what I had a Mordechai come and tell me he didn't have to tell me it was already written in the Bible then in the moment of twenty one I were gonna be changed but you know what he done he lined it up trumps you'll sound dead in Christ shall rise first we shall be changed and then we all gonna get out of here and we're gonna leave the Haman behind and we're gonna let him just do his business down here you think he's running now you where do we get out of here we're in the King granted the Jews which were never sitting together themselves together and to stand for their life watch this I like what brother Ernie says brother and he says how come black them if you don't have tea if you don't have teeth gum the devil to death because look what eat anyway look Jesus told us the kingdom of heaven is taken by oh oh yeah a feather no force cat pack what do you tell them we're in the king grand the Jews - just just say no don't do that no stand for your life destroy to sway close to parish do you know who won his call he's calling down judgment hold his own people the king is gonna send this army anyway remember the Angels he sends the angels out got scripture for all this folk he sends the angels the Reapers and he tells them to cut everything down but separate the wheat from the tares what's he doing right here stand for your life to destroy the slate it comes to perish all the power of the people and the prominence that would assault them both little ones and women and to take the spot listen not only just to defend yourself that's good but you know what he's telling he's saying look take all the spoil with you take all the spoil with you for a prey upon one day and all the provinces of king of source namely upon the 13th day of the 12th month which is the month adar now remember just to jump forward that's called the day of Purim P you are M and they still celebrate it every year they celebrate what happened because they would have been wiped out don't worry about Egypt and all them different people Haman was gonna wipe them people off the face of the earth same way was Hitler I told you when Haman died that spirit just went over into another somebody and we saw that manifest right here in the forties when Hitler was getting ready to destroy the Jews amen but thank God even with that see even with that God put in there behind the Bible a fifth sealed you there's gonna be giving eternal life just because there's you upon one day and all the prophets of king of source namely upon the 13th day of the 12th month which is a month adar the copy of the writings for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all the people and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves he told them the very day it was coming hello somebody I'm coming today defend yourself today we call that Monday and the congregation says the ones that are retired never then seen every day is a Saturday to them but that's on Monday right really yes on Monday that's our trial and tribulation day we feel good it's good to be a Christian on Sunday but Monday hmm fight that thing but we had it published folks we had it written in our language to tell us that not just one day for us but the day of the Lord we are now in when you got born again you were entered in the day of the Lord not one 24-hour day you entered into the day of the Lord so that the post-event that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves from their enemies you know what if you got a problem open up the book read where you win and then listen to a couple of sermons where brother branham preaches on the rapture and the change in Abraham and like we've been talking about so the Post that wrote upon mules and camels went out being hastened and pressed on by the Kings commandment and the decree was given as Shushan the palace where did it go - you called me a mule if you want - I don't care but a fivefold ministry carries this message you can call me a camel I really don't care there's other things beside the donkey people call me but that's okay I really don't mind but this is the way you're gonna get it this is the way you're gonna get what this commandment is listen they didn't have email text messages they had human flesh that physically went out and said you need to tell your people that June whatever it is that day you're gonna have a fight you gotta be ready though now now brother is ready but what about some of us the rest of us are we ready for the day of the battle are we ready are we just going I really don't think that's gonna happen you think that's gonna happen I ain't go to church you go to church huh you read your Bible you listen that little short man why you have to do that why he ain't ain't nothing to it no they took it serious because it came with some authority it came from the Kings commandment it was a seal thank God for that seal and then he opened it up because look being hastened and pressed on by the Kings commandment and the decree was giving us sheesh on the palace and Mordecai went out from the presence of the king and what royal apparel of Wow what did the angel tell brother branham did you be gathered with your people you were an important person on earth remember he's got a crown laid up bigger than ours and you know what God did it not some personal son God did it God showed him what about how I'm staying another day what about brother Branham you know he never really preached on Esther he never took Esther as a text but he spoke of Esther a few times but what about him reading that I believe he stayed away from that for a reason that's just me that's just a me quote I think he stayed away from the book of Esther because he knew that Mordecai was him so he stayed away from it you you look gonna look up after he only speaks of estrus six or eight times and it scattered all over the there's no sermon of extra chapter one and you really never says anything much about more to come but if you see a prophet reading the Bible and you seem read that book of Esther and he goes hmm little man little man what's he do oh he's got a king's signature he's got a ring he's got a position that's just me not just me that's just what I think all right look at verse fifteen and Mordecai went out from the presence of the king and royal apparel and blue and white with great crown of gold and with the garment of fine linen and purple and the City of Shushan rejoiced and was glad the Jews had light and gladness and joy and honor you and I should be the same way because we have a chance through this little man with what the Commission of God to tell us Esther to tell us Esther's people how to defend ourselves to me that's the greatest chapter showing we see adoption we see a way to defend ourselves we see that look in every province in every city where so ever the king's commandment and his decree came the Jews had joy and gladness a feast and a good day no we still got a battle but we know what day it is now we know who's coming and we got something to defend ourselves with and many of the people of the land look at this and many of the people of the land there's you foolish virgin many of the people the land became Jews for the fear of the Jews fell upon them you know if you knew that you were gonna make you gonna tell me how to act cuz cuz I'm a heathen and you're a Christian you tell me how to act so they won't kill me right that's when people want to get around you you want to be salting the Christian there's a Christian that salt in it brings people in because you know what they're gonna die physically and spiritually this world is gonna die and without me and you it's gonna be a lot of them but God's give us something to defend ourselves with amen he's give us something to defend ourselves with let's continue a few more minutes we'll be done chapter 9 now what happens is now in the twelfth month now we're getting to the time we're getting to the time now that the things gonna happen we're getting to the end time we're at the end time we are at the end time they're getting toward the end time now in the twelfth month that is the month adar in the thirteenth day of the same when the Kings commandment and here's the Creed do near to put in execution now remember the day you eat thereof the day you die still right here you gonna die there's gonna be a battle and without something you're gonna die because I have decreed that the day you eat thereof the day you die so he's not reversing anything when the Kings commandment has decreed you neared to be put in execution in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them hmm though it was turned to the contrary that the root Jews had rule over them that hated them look the Jews gathered themselves together on Sunday and Wednesday they knew where to go they didn't just stay out in the field they didn't go play golf on Sunday a Christian well anyway the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities they knew where to go you and I know where to go the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of king of sors to lay hand on such as salt their hurt watch this right here and no man could withstand them no weapon formed can stand against me now that's still written in here and no man could withstand them for the fear of them fell upon all people now here's Haman try he was going to gather this big group this big bunch of demons and we're going after that bride we're going to take her over we're going to kill her every one of them look how God turns it around if you're gonna be a priest in the king you're gonna have something to rule over and it's not with the rod of iron it's with nail-scarred hands like Jesus for the fear of them fell upon all people don't you know when we come to the white throne judgment are you gonna be afraid of anything noop cuz you don't have to go you're not standing out there you're standing is the judge and who's gonna be fear who's gonna have the fear those people that walk up in front of you are gonna look at you and go oh my I did that to that person and if they're any kind of a halfway Christian all they gotta do is read the Bible that says if you do that to the least of my little ones you've done it under me that's the same way here the Jew said we're Jews we can defend ourselves but God even give us so much power that the fear of them fell upon all people and all the rulers of the province and the lieutenant's and the deputies in the office of the king help the Jews they got converted hallelujah they have the Jews now wait a minute they're supposed to help to the Medes and Persians that great big army mm-hmm now if you get converted you won't because the fear of Mordechai fell upon them from Mordecai was great in the King's house and his fame went out through all the provinces for this man Mordecai watched greater and greater now written in my Bible a long time ago when I first studied this it wasn't that Mordecai grew greater and greater it was what he said because he's a little short guy like brother Burman said you know that hundred fifty-pound God that puts his hand up like this and stops at 12 ton tractor-trailer coming down the road it's not the power of the man it's the power behind the man so it was the power behind Mordecai that helped him graduate or wax greater and greater because you got to remember Mordecai in this whole story he never walks out like Haman and says I'm the number one guy I'm the number one guy brother I'll never say he said I'm the least that's my brush when God chose that man above everybody he had the character that he needed to teach us something thus the Jews just slapped all their little enemies and and just a toe shoe devil go on no they smell off with the stroke of the sword what's the sword the word they smote him with the stroke of the what the power that lays in this word and slaughter and destruction did what they would unto those that hated them and in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed 500 men right there in the palace and all those words I cannot pronounce just keep rolling it on up don't even want to let anyone talk about them people that's all the different places now look even the ten sons of Haman he still had some preachers out there we forgot about that for a minute didn't we Haman had ten sons and you know what the sons like the daddy so he had ten line preachers out there like we were preached before and because remember that was 12 spies went across the land two of them brought a good report ten I'm lied 10 lyin preachers so the 10 line preachers of Haman guess what happened to them they slew them but on the spoil Wade they knocked their hand they in other words they left that part alone well that day the number that were slain and she's on the palace was brought before the king and the King said unto Esther the Queen the Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in the palace and the ten sons of Haman what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces now what is our petition now what every other time when she asked for something he said whatever you want up to half the kingdom right three times said what do you own up to half the kingdom now watch this Esther comes to a position that it's not half anymore this is where you can bring in the King of Kings and the Lord of lords in Revelations 19 because he has given her total power now he's not limiting her he says what is that petition and it shall be granted thee if she'd have said I want every one of your provinces and all your gold he would have said here now you didn't say that before why because he you need to learn trust with God he knows who to trust and who not but you need to learn trust but in here the King was going well I'm not I'm not stupid I'm gonna just give her half if she asks for it but now what he's come to a place to know what she wants and he's gonna grant her anything she asked or what is thy request further and it shall be done when Jesus said it is finished on the cross he meant what he said now we know that's further work but it wasn't him right it was the bride what's the future work watch now what then said Esther if it pleases the King let it be granted to the Jews which are in the palace to do tomorrow also according to this day's the qurían let Haman's ten sons behind in the gallows hmm God's not going to put up with that false doctrine and the king commanded it to be so done and the decree was given to in the palace and they hang Haman's ten sons for the Jews that were in the palace gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and slew three hundred men we already know that but to pray they laid not their hand but the other Jews that were in the Kings probably insist gathered themselves together stood for their lives had rest from their enemies and slew of their foes seventy five thousand people remember we've got two hundred thousand thousand of them we got to destroy remember the demons that were loosed in the river Euphrates remember this loosed on the bride but we will overcome on the 13th day of the month adar and on the fourteenth day of the same rested day and made it a day of feasting and gladness hello let's go down skip down to verse two number nine chapter now I mean number 19 therefore the Jews of the villages that dwelt in the unwalled towns made the fourteenth day a month adar a day of gladness and feasting a good day and of sending portions one to another and Mordecai wrote these things and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of king of source both nine and far - what to stablish this this message to establish this message in the different provinces all across the country to establish this that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month adar and the fifteenth day of the same yearly as the days were in the Jews rested from their enemy our day of Purim people it's when we received the new birth that's how Jesus said come to me all that labor and heavy laden and I'll give you rest that's the day we destroyed the devil in the soul now we've got a process to keep going but look and the Jews undertook to do as they had begun and has more two kind written to them Mordecai Mordecai Mordecai and they cast pour which is a lot to consume them that was why they call it the day of Purim now look at verse 25 but when Esther came before the king he commanded by letters that his wicked device which he devised against the Jews should return upon his own head and that he and his son should be hung on the gallows he's talking about Haman wherefore they call those days Purim after the day of pure therefore for all the words of this letter that's which they had seen concerning this matter in which had come unto them the Jews ordained and took upon them and upon their seed it's still going on today and upon all such as joined themselves unto them so that they should not fail that they will keep these two days according to the writings of the according to their appointed time every year and that these days should be remembered it's so important see we get to do it on Sunday and Wednesday play when we read the Bible when we read the message we've got a continual feast day that's why we're talking about we're gonna talk about these feast days because they're they're very important to us without the feast days you don't get born again you don't go in the rapture so I'm pretty important you know and that these days of Purim should not fail them on the Jews and other memorial then perish from their seed now watch this I like this right here I wrote my I wrote I wrote in the Bible right here I wrote where is the King you hadn't heard from them in a while where's the king I thought he's one who had all the authority but I thought he's one that transferred all the authority because what's this then Esther the Queen will be finished on here then Esther the Queen the daughter of Abigail and Mordecai the Jew wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of Purim and he sent letters unto all the Jews to the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of a source with words of peace and truth what's this to confirm these days of pyramid their times appointed according as more to college you and Esther the Queen hadn't joined them now you're not hearing anything about the king in other words he has he's he's running the universe and Mordecai and Esther is now running the show amen but remember he didn't do that at the beginning this is at the end of the journey this is at the end of your journey remember she's not a she's not a bride anymore she's a wife and man and we've got Mordecai there we're a Mordecai's message it's becoming more real how many times listen how many times you go through the day and something happens and you think of what brother brown said it ain't many days goodbye that I don't something a little something will happen it doesn't matter if it's in your life or anything you'll hear you'll hear that Mordecai say something that pertains to our effects what you're doing right and that's not bad that's good that God brings to your remembrance what he has said to confirm these days of Purim and in their times appointed according to more to college you and Esther the Queen hadn't joined them as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed the matters of the fasting in the crime and the decree of Esther I'm Mordecai not the king Esther Esther has become listen at the first of this of this act or play she wasn't so very important she was a little poor girl didn't have a mom and dad and was raised by her uncle look what she's risen to when you and I started our journey were nothing but to God he knows that that's why I love this journey of a believer it takes everybody even Ruth look at Ruth Ruth was nobody she was the ball by this and everybody nobody knew who she was now she's the most important person in the world at the end of this at the end of the of the program the mama goes off to say or the mother-in-law goes you know off the scene and then here she goes and gets with with Boaz and then they have a baby and then mama steps back on the same well she has to because that's the Jews coming back what's this and the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim and it was written in the book Esther birth chapter 10 this is the end of it right here what's this and the king of Soros laid a tribute upon the land and upon the Isles of the sea that means he put one foot on land and one foot on sea and all the acts of his power and of his might and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai weren't to the king advanced him are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of the Medes and Persians this whole world is going to have to proclaim who we are for Mordecai the Jew was next unto king of Soros and great among the Jews and accepted of the multitude of his brethren seeking the wealth of his people dr. Walter be self here that you see that his seat well to myself he seek the wealth of his people brother Branham says you're my children but he didn't espouse us to himself he espoused us to Christ don't you ever forget that seeking the wealth of his people and speaking peace to all his seed that's why man you can have peace today is that we've had a message of the hour to tell us listen we've got tomorrow's news today we've got next weeks next month well if we are here another year we know basically what's gonna happen all because this little man from Kentucky from obscurity that had to what I say but this other day daddy says he was poor he had to wear shoes it is his brothers gave him and had to tack the end of it shut because it was too they were too big and that right yeah yeah your brothers and then here's William Branham the great prophet the Great Mordecai to come not to save us folks but he come to give us a way to fight give us a way to fight that devil in to fight the things that we have in our life and he goes swimming and he's got a pair of pair overall that's held on with a nail one nail don't even have enough he'll have two nails though John cuz there's two straps on it he had one probably hanging down and once one nail stuck through that what a man what a man I'll clap what a man what a mortar kind that he walks up and goes through the town and he said people would walk on the other side of the street because he had a bad name he had a bad name Brandon was not a good name all of them were dump drunks died with the boots on basically the cliche I guess you might say and here God took that man out of obscurity he gave him a position when he was over there I passed the curtain of time he said they lifted me up on their shoulders they did not him they did and they said you're special down here but you got to go back because you got some more sermons to preach you've got some Mordecai you got some more work to do because I'm gonna take you up on the mountain one day and I'm gonna give you the signal and if anybody hears anything it's got to come from you if you're gonna take a body change bride it's got to come from this message of the hour it cannot come from the Bible alone you got to have the prophets message to line that up because remember King wrote it and you die because the day you eat thereof that day you're gonna die sorry John the day you eat thereof the day you're gonna die we have no hope I'll fly away Oh glory I'll fly away when I die everybody's on my desk but when you open it up and you see the love letter how can he kill his bride how could he kill Esther even when she walked in and said if I die today I die today I'm gonna get something from the King can you say that today today I'm going to get something from the king god bless you let's stand to our feet did you know that story of Esther like the all the commentators tell you they put that in the Bible even though it had made no mention of God but as Scofield toll tells us as we've seen these past few services it is so interlaced with the Christian journey and so interlaced with and but see now look let me tell you how this goes further doctor Scofield probably looked it looked at this aster and said what that's the bride well who's this mordecai guy who's just mordecai guy he he's inserted all that stuff that's the father or the uncle that's that's helping this Esther but you and I you and I know what that character portrayed we saw him and we heard him with our own ears and sister Clayton some of them had seen him with his own eyes sister Margaery pray to you you were little no you sat on his lap I'm brother brown flap did you really well that's great you were well you could have been more than four or five or three okay so that means that Freight is 60 years old so I you just told your age I just I'm just telling you but we can you know we have all these we've seen this but what is it done for us it's drove a lot people away but it's made a lot of people more established in the present day truth it's made people more established because of listening to that little Mordecai and doing what he said because you know what he's not going to tell you anything different from the king if it would have been any time that that King said oh wait a minute no it's just like when Adam was on the earth and he was naming the animals and he named that elephant that great thing with the trunk he named it an elephant God didn't go no I wouldn't name that he said that's exactly what I named that that's the same way brother Branham when he said he went back into the mind of God he didn't just stay there he brought it right out here and he and we got it in eleven hundred sermons we got it in every province in the nation

greatest do you remember you see that in your life you know you it doesn't say - it says fight be brave you remember you if you ever watched Muhammad Ali a lot of times he he'd get like this and he'd hold on for a little while you know what brother brother Joel said he was going I'm gonna beat you you gone in about two minutes when I go when I come back here are you gone well you know what if the devil ever gets you up close like this whisper that Nazir tell them your go go see when you let me go when you let me go I'm gonna put your laptop if you would wait for my keep [Music] Oh universe fight me break against of all evil if you keep on the firing line [Music] if you would win for God in the sorry that day the Jews defeated their enemy [Music] they didn't put the instruments up they brought them out and they had a feast for two days why because they had defeated an enemy that was proclaiming that they don't have a chance we're so much bigger than they are we've got a kingdom from India to Ethiopian we're just gonna wipe you little people off the earth and the Jews said well we do have a right to defend ourselves and we've been given the provision and the very day that you guys are gonna attack so we're gonna be ready and brother John when you get some days when you do have my head laid over like this and you go devil when I get up when I get up you're a goner when you get up in the morning and you put your feet on the floor all hell's against you but there's provision been made we're not fighting with feathers we're fighting with swords and we win whatever happens Rodin doesn't matter we win we've already won if we're born again but we don't really win when we walk in one day and the redeemed walked through those gates and the Angels have to stop because they can't join in they've never been redeemed but you and I came from a life of sin and by God calling you and you accepting the call it's like brother Dale was preaching that you got to remember just for a minute here we're gonna go outside and talk to a five o'clock anyway or longer God is calling you how is he calling you to a preacher through you reading the Bible through the message of the hour that's where he's calling you and then all of a sudden one day you say well I've been seeking God no it's him what happened the the switch was he spoke to you first he said I didn't hear God listen what convicted you somebody bringing something to you that brought conviction to you well that wasn't brother Dale our brother wait that was God because God knew what you would need because how many hundreds of times have you listened to other places other sermons other people but all of a sudden you go talking to me right you remember that you better I'll remember that that there was one day when something caught your voice now after that you stopped guarding you why because you felt what listen you got fat be found lost before you can be found you got to be found lost you gotta say I'm lost I'm lost and then God speaks to you so it's God calling you the whole time they don't matter how many sermons you hear there's one sermon in this scripture and this don't scripture in this Bible that's the sermon that's gonna click in your heart see mine what in Genesis 1:26 cuz I ain't have anything I didn't have a clue bout Genesis 1:26 when I was a sinner but once I become a Christian but the other scriptures in the Bible I knew I was condemned Bible when I come to that Genesis 1 it was after I got born again and God started unfolding and he said that's you that's when I made you now remember we didn't have a beginning but that was when we were what put on display that's when we were put on display and God said there's mum there's my bride there's my Adam and there's my Eve I'm gonna have a family now all these ministers god bless you you do the work of the Lord it doesn't matter if people fall asleep on you Bob [Music] I'm getting to that somewhere you're just preaching to one person but God didn't put you up here to preach to nobody he gives you a job to preach to one person maybe one person will get what you said the rest won't but then the next sermon how many of you heard me the next sermon the next preacher comes in and the preachers preaches something and you get a blessing from Oh see that's the way God works that's our King he knows what we need he puts you in the service to get it [Music] predestination but he knew you would want it and he got it for you he put it in a book that'll kill you what a paradox he put it in a book full of judgment but he gave you see always see now his Christian always see his life every Scripture we read we see life even when you look at the judgment I've already been judged I don't like to be judged again I've already been judged I was chosen in him and he was judged if he's judged perfect I'm perfect that's what we gotta say I look at him if the devil looks at me I go that man died for me and Jesus go talk to him if you got a problem with me go talk to him because I was chosen in him before the foundation of the world brother boy do you want to come and just for saying he's got something he wants to propose to the people and I agree 100% because it affects all of us the Lord is laid upon my heart that I would like maybe next weekend well after the trip of everybody because we're going to be resting right
