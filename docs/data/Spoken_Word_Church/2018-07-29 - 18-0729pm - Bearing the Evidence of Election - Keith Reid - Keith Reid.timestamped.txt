[21:53] church then in Revelation chapter 14 and
[22:02] verse 9 to verse 11 and the third angel
[22:10] followed them saying with a loud voice
[22:12] if any man worship the Beast and His
[22:15] image and receive his mark in his
[22:18] forehead or in his hand the same shall
[22:21] drink of the wine of the wrath of God

[22:27] the cup of ignition and I shall torment
[22:31] be tormented with fire and brimstone in
[22:34] the presence of the Holy Angels and in
[22:37] the presence of the Lamb and the smoke
[22:40] of their torment ascends it up forever
[22:43] and ever and they have no rest day nor
[22:46] night who worship the Beast and His
[22:49] image and also ever received the mark of
[22:53] his name may we bow our heads everywhere

[23:32] Lord we thank you God for

[23:46] of our heart as we give you thanks and
[23:48] praise you in Jesus name we pray amen
[23:50] and amen god bless you you may be seated
[23:54] you know we want to certainly thank God
[23:57] for His mercies and His grace towards us
[24:00] and you know the Bible says that the
[24:03] footsteps of the righteous they are
[24:05] ordered by the Lord you know sometimes
[24:08] you see things happening in your life
[24:10] and you would say you know I don't see
[24:12] no glory in this really but you've got
[24:15] to take side with the word against
[24:17] yourself amen hallelujah because that's
[24:20] what he says you've got to believe it
[24:22] aim and praise God and so you know what
[24:25] we're not trusting in the things that we
[24:27] see we're not trusting in the
[24:29] circumstances around us we're trusting
[24:31] in the unfailing words of Almighty God
[24:33] aim and praise God and you know back
[24:36] home where we've we've had our fair
[24:38] share of of trials of tests of you know
[24:41] there's different things that happen
[24:43] really but in all we say thanks be to
[24:45] God amen you know last year it was just
[24:50] about October you know just before our
[24:52] meeting the Francine's you know at last
[24:56] her sister and it was so devastating to
[25:00] us really you know that morning you know
[25:03] I was ready for church and I came out
[25:06] and I heard her on the phone I I pause I
[25:08] listen and I realized she was talking to
[25:11] her sister and you know I I said I mean
[25:14] what happened to her and she said you
[25:16] know she's sick and she just gave me the
[25:18] phone and I was talking to her you know
[25:21] just joking with her real weird and she
[25:23] was laughing and and so and she said I'm
[25:26] sick and I said well you know because
[25:27] you don't have something in the mornings
[25:29] and you know she said you know the same
[25:32] problem I had 2014 is back and you know
[25:35] I I talked her I said I was saying to
[25:37] friends and I said go get her and you
[25:39] know they made a plan they said well
[25:41] we're going to go to church and if
[25:43] anything's worse she said you know
[25:45] she'll call and and all of that you know
[25:48] we didn't realize that while she was
[25:50] talking to us her body was just shutting
[25:53] down and by the time she had called her
[25:56] dad she called us and she called her
[25:58] daughter and said you know coming sister
[26:00] by the time davia got there really she
[26:03] was even too weak to get dressed for the
[26:06] hospital and by the time she got there
[26:08] she died you know just tremendous so
[26:11] sudden and so but you know when you when
[26:14] you look back at these things you
[26:15] realize that it is as though God was
[26:17] giving you warning of the things that
[26:20] were happening sometimes you you can't
[26:22] really read the signals that are coming
[26:25] to you and and we went through that I
[26:27] think in March you know and I think it
[26:30] was a Friday the 13th you know in the
[26:34] afternoon I got a call that my smallest
[26:38] brother he had called me and he said you
[26:40] know they've got a report that you know
[26:43] Shaun Shaun Reed was hit by a truck and
[26:47] he had died at the hospital and man I
[26:51] tell you so I left and I I was thinking
[26:54] that he had died so I went to the
[26:56] funeral home and you know I speak to the
[26:58] man they know me very well as you know
[27:00] minister in the area and they took me
[27:03] there downstairs and they took the body
[27:05] and you know I look I said no that's not
[27:07] my brother because he's a small fellow
[27:10] and when I look at this person was big I
[27:12] didn't know where they took him out and
[27:14] unreal everything I said my lord and and
[27:17] there he was you know he was hit by the
[27:21] truck he was just walking along the road
[27:23] the driver fell asleep and just didn't
[27:26] take a car Nate came straight hit him
[27:28] you know they took him up they carry him
[27:30] to the hospital and you know before he
[27:33] could call anybody
[27:34] he died and while we were going through
[27:38] that you know in Jamaica you know I know
[27:40] in America somebody died within three
[27:42] days you bury them not in Jamaica really
[27:45] I mean six weeks is a normal time and
[27:49] there's a number of reasons why we do
[27:50] that you've got to understand our
[27:51] culture you know I remember brother Dale
[27:54] was there with lost a sister and you
[27:56] know he went with us to the weekend
[27:58] you must have been wondering what I'm
[28:00] hurt they're doing but it seems that
[28:02] we're rejoicing but it's just our
[28:04] culture really and so you know sometimes
[28:07] it doesn't matter how a debt took place
[28:11] by your British law they've got to do
[28:13] one and our Topsy to still declare the
[28:16] cause of that so you know a cause of
[28:19] that cannot be that a truck hit on
[28:21] somebody it has to be exactly what
[28:24] happens inside that caused the debt and
[28:26] and that is why and so you might have
[28:29] one pathologist for the entire island
[28:31] and so you know there's a lotta are cops
[28:34] is to be done and you've got to wait on
[28:35] that really and so so you know we just
[28:39] get adjusted six weeks a bit of a normal
[28:41] time you know and so so while we you
[28:44] know we were waiting you know for for
[28:47] that I mean one morning I came up we
[28:49] were I was going to work and as we sit
[28:52] at the table we we were getting ready
[28:53] for breakfast and um you know she got a
[28:55] call and she answered the caller and she
[28:58] said Keith brother Dixon is not
[29:01] responding and so I got up from the
[29:03] table I lived just about three OSes down
[29:06] the road from us really and I was just
[29:08] going to go by the house really and as
[29:11] soon as I going through the door she she
[29:13] called she said no they're in the hills
[29:15] around their way to Kingston and so what
[29:19] had happened really they were going to
[29:21] Kingston there was brother Dixon his
[29:23] wife and his son and one of our Deacon
[29:26] was there in the vehicle with them and
[29:28] they were talking along the road really
[29:31] and the Dixon said she recognized that
[29:34] he was moving he was responding and she
[29:38] showed out to him really
[29:39] no brother we'd have driven through the
[29:42] hills it's a drop-off to know where I'm
[29:45] the mountain on the other side really
[29:47] but God was so good yes he was driving
[29:51] the vehicle just came to a stop and
[29:54] stopped there and so and you know they
[29:58] it was stiff so they couldn't move him
[30:00] out of the vehicle or so you know
[30:03] so we're call Monique because she wasn't
[30:05] us Monique lives just at the bottom of
[30:07] the hill there really and we call her
[30:10] they'd call the police and
[30:12] you know they the police come and you
[30:14] know get the body out of the vehicle and
[30:16] they realize that he was gone and so you
[30:22] know man I tell you I had my brother and
[30:24] this no really I went into the room and
[30:28] I I grabbed my Bible out of my bag and I
[30:31] I hope and I was thinking I said Lord
[30:34] give me a word and I hope in my Bible
[30:38] and it opened to Acts chapter one and I
[30:42] read the verse 8 for you shall receive
[30:46] power after the Holy Ghost is come upon
[30:49] you and immediately with that I drop
[30:52] down on my knees and I said Lord and you
[30:55] know is as though somebody said to me
[30:57] read the next verse and you know that
[31:01] scripture in in Acts chapter 1 very
[31:06] familiar you know but very profound and
[31:09] when I read the second that the next
[31:13] verse verse 9 and when he had spoken
[31:15] these things while they beheld he was
[31:19] taken up and a cloud received him out of
[31:22] their sight that's what he said and
[31:24] immediately my heart I said Lord he's
[31:27] gone and you know I I got up and I I was
[31:32] pacing the floor I said Lord not today
[31:35] not another one Lord I said Lord let him
[31:40] come back and share the testimony of
[31:43] what happened to him really but I tell
[31:47] you brethren desperation it brings the
[31:52] promise of God you know I I was thinking
[31:55] what to do and it came to me I call back
[32:00] sister Dixon and she said brother
[32:02] kitties that I said put the phone at his
[32:05] ears and she says I said put the phone
[32:09] at his ears she put the phone in his
[32:11] years really the police was under way
[32:13] carrying the body and I started to pray
[32:16] and as I prayed you know just pouring
[32:20] out before God I said God not another
[32:22] one she responds she said
[32:26] the kid is moving his mouth I said
[32:28] thanks be to God thanks be to God
[32:35] and you know they took him to the
[32:37] hospital
[32:38] the doctors took him they kept him there
[32:42] for about three days
[32:43] I think they kept him there there on all
[32:46] the tests that they could run they said
[32:49] we don't see anything wrong with this
[32:50] man we serve a miracle-working God amen
[32:59] a miracle-working God amen you know
[33:03] brother Dixon he comes back to church
[33:06] and he said brethren heaven is real he
[33:13] said before they even recognize what had
[33:16] happened he was looking at the vehicle
[33:19] moving he was seeing everything there he
[33:22] said but he wasn't in it really he said
[33:25] he went back home and he walked around
[33:28] the house he said the flowers at home
[33:30] was the most beautiful he had ever seen
[33:33] them and he said he was just taken up
[33:37] and he said he remember going away and
[33:40] was thinking that I never even had time
[33:43] to tell everybody that I'm gone but he
[33:46] said that place that he had gone to he
[33:49] said listen I never won he said I was
[33:52] looking down over the city of kings and
[33:54] he said how did I live so long in that
[33:58] wicked world he said where I'd gone to
[34:01] he said I never wanted to come back but
[34:04] he said you call me back amen
[34:07] you know i oughtta your brethren I
[34:09] believe it is real it is real
[34:15] amen and you know I said I thank God I
[34:20] thank God you know brethren that is not
[34:23] a state of absence for the believer
[34:27] we've got a reality that is real one
[34:31] move out of this body you're in another
[34:34] dimension with God amen and you know
[34:37] like a prophet tell us he said and it's
[34:38] more real on the other side that it is
[34:41] on this side amen you know I understand
[34:44] when Paul could have said oh debt where
[34:48] is your sting and grave where is the
[34:52] victory amen praise God you know before
[34:56] that morning brother Dixon we recognized
[34:59] it was sick and it was going about three
[35:03] weeks and that Sunday you know I think
[35:06] that was that happen on the Tuesday
[35:08] that's Sunday we wanted to go pray for
[35:11] him because that was the first time he
[35:13] didn't turn up at church but we had a
[35:16] funeral after a morning service we would
[35:18] have service like you we break for an
[35:20] hour and then we have the second service
[35:22] so the second service was actually a
[35:24] funeral so we couldn't leave so you know
[35:27] remember brother Kevin had gone there to
[35:29] the host really so we knew he was sick
[35:32] you know and we didn't know exactly what
[35:35] happened really what was wrong with him
[35:37] but one thing I can say when God bring
[35:41] him back from the dead what happened to
[35:44] him before the doctors couldn't find any
[35:47] trace of any of that amen and I say
[35:51] thanks be to God thanks be to God amen
[35:55] so brethren I tell you but the brand
[35:58] said divine healing is the earnest of
[36:00] the Resurrection I mean we know we're
[36:03] going to have a resurrection like his
[36:05] Amen
[36:06] and I'll tell you I don't care what the
[36:08] devil does it's going to be more
[36:10] glorious on the other side than it is on
[36:13] this side amen and what he's doing
[36:16] hallelujah is given a glimpse of the
[36:20] other side
[36:21] don't fear little flock it is your
[36:24] father's good will to give to you the
[36:27] kingdom
[36:28] amen praise God so this evening I'd like
[36:31] to speak a little bit on bearing the
[36:34] evidence I said bearing the evidence of
[36:36] who you are who you are you know I said
[36:41] when we look at each other when we look
[36:43] at people you look at the outward frame
[36:46] and you you decide what is on the inside
[36:48] you know I've always that a problem with
[36:51] young people there that they dress a
[36:53] certain way and so you know they might
[36:56] be on the street and the police see them
[36:58] and and immediately they they have a
[37:02] frame of what they think they are
[37:04] because of the way they look and I said
[37:06] why you want to look like that if you're
[37:09] not against the way you want to look
[37:10] like one if you're not a criminal what
[37:13] you want to look like a criminal and
[37:14] then if somebody say you are then you
[37:17] get upset but but even us believers you
[37:20] know people dress a certain way and you
[37:22] can tell what is that long the inside
[37:25] because what's happening on the inside
[37:27] is reflecting on the outside that there
[37:30] is something about the believer though
[37:32] you know we bear the evidence of who we
[37:36] are by what we say what we do you know
[37:41] where somebody lives when you speak to
[37:43] them when you fellowship with them
[37:45] really then whether they have faith in
[37:47] the Word of God are the adult in the
[37:49] Word of God there's people there that
[37:51] the natural characteristic is that
[37:53] they're just of a complex amen
[37:56] and it might be one extreme or the other
[37:58] extreme you know that's the way it is
[38:01] and everybody bear a characteristics
[38:04] really Amen but I believe when we are
[38:07] Christians we reflect the Word of God
[38:10] don't let nobody fool you if Christ live
[38:13] in a house he express himself amen
[38:16] hallelujah no no with a message of the
[38:20] hour and if this we know that not all is
[38:23] going to make it in the rapture amen but
[38:26] the Prophet even tell us he said there's
[38:28] three kind of believer in every Church
[38:31] you know it's not for you to say well
[38:34] well if you're they believe and you're
[38:36] me then I'm no sir that's not it
[38:39] you be the belief
[38:41] amen you just read the believer amen
[38:45] no no to the ladies in church he said
[38:48] and listen you know Leticia is it is a
[38:52] finer church age but yet the bride is
[38:55] caught up in the revelation of the word
[38:58] revelation 4:1 that's for us come up
[39:02] into the open door and a door is a
[39:05] revelation amen but while we are there
[39:09] Leticia is right there with us and it
[39:12] doesn't matter what we do not
[39:14] everybody's gonna take the word Amen but
[39:18] there's going to be people in the church
[39:20] that's just not I'm not the Redeem
[39:23] there's gonna be people in the church
[39:26] that yes they're going to be saved but
[39:28] they've got to go through the
[39:29] tribulation but but listen somebody said
[39:33] then well where should we preach even
[39:36] some says well let us preach to those
[39:39] who haven't heard it I said no I said
[39:42] let us preach the word so high that
[39:44] Eagles will follow and come up to the
[39:47] Word of God amen hallelujah but you know
[39:52] if we look at it really this morning not
[39:55] all that was in Moses Melanie Exodus
[39:59] make it into the land of promise as a
[40:02] matter fact it was saw that they said
[40:04] that - that came out of Egypt merited to
[40:09] the land of promise I trust God it's not
[40:13] like that this evening
[40:14] amen only Joshua and Caleb it was those
[40:18] who are born humbly in the wilderness
[40:21] that went in with them into the promise
[40:23] is it Ron Amen not all that was with
[40:27] Jesus aiming you know you you talk about
[40:30] the church somebody sometimes look at us
[40:32] possible the deal and they said well you
[40:34] know you've got any pocket in your
[40:35] church well I'll tell you how much
[40:38] you've got Jesus not only twelve and one
[40:42] of them was a different hello
[40:44] so don't blame me now it's just the
[40:47] nature of it is it wrong if I'm 12
[40:52] twelve righteous but Jesus at twelve one
[40:56] was a devil one deny him one said if I
[41:01] don't put my finger in his side homily
[41:03] and touch I won't believe that was
[41:06] Thomas hello
[41:07] but then walk with him for three and a
[41:10] half years and at the end of it that's
[41:13] where they were is awry hallelujah and
[41:17] so what we say about the message of the
[41:20] hour hallelujah amen not all that say
[41:23] they believe brother Branham is a
[41:24] prophet they meant some even said well
[41:27] as long as you love the Prophet that's
[41:30] all right hey man I tell you that sounds
[41:32] real good but that's a lie is that right
[41:36] I'm not a before you've got two other
[41:37] token is awry amen
[41:41] but this we will say Jesus Christ is the
[41:44] message of the hour amen but the Branham
[41:48] of Holland it was over Eleazar him in
[41:52] bringing the bride Rebekah a mentor
[41:55] Issac Jesus Christ hallelujah brother

[42:24] question hallelujah is therefore is the
[42:28] foolish virgin out in the church world
[42:31] or is a foolish virgin among the runs of
[42:35] the message of the hour that's a
[42:38] question where are they hallelujah
[42:42] now the foolish virgins they were
[42:45] satisfied with their position Halloween
[42:49] ever got for the oiler never received
[42:52] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and will
[42:55] go into the tribulation they will reject
[42:59] the endtime revelation of the word
[43:02] is awry hallelujah and therefore they're
[43:07] going to miss the rapture amen
[43:11] brethren I tell you you know there in
[43:13] Halloween Revelation chapter 3 the
[43:17] bottle speaks
[43:18] Jesus said I rather you are hot or cold
[43:22] but because you're lukewarm and neither
[43:26] hot nor cold I will spew you out of my
[43:30] mouth he said I'd rather you were cold
[43:33] let us say me cold

[43:38] just there in the number let us say be
[43:41] hotter Haman mean you're a true believer

[43:52] hot you're not cold is that right you're
[43:55] bearing the image of boat is errata
[43:58] hallelujah amen now the unbeliever he
[44:04] said like this no the unbeliever attend
[44:08] church but without the revelation of the
[44:11] word hallelujah II just attend church
[44:15] just as a shore you know people said
[44:19] well if I don't go to church somebody's
[44:22] gonna call and ask me what happened
[44:25] so I'm just going to be a charger so
[44:28] nobody asks me anything
[44:31] amen it's not because you want to be
[44:35] there but I don't want anybody to have
[44:37] to ask me and I've got to find an excuse
[44:39] so I'm going to be in church hallelujah
[44:43] they've got a form of godliness
[44:46] hallelujah but deny the power varies

[45:41] we're living in is it rod in other words
[45:45] I say like this back home there are
[45:47] people in the church that if they were
[45:50] out in the Baptist Church there would
[45:52] have been the same way is that wrong
[45:56] they're not here because of the
[45:58] revelation of Jesus Christ
[45:59] they're just here because circumstance
[46:02] in their life calls them to be here
[46:05] so they go to church amen as tradition
[46:09] and this is where they go might be
[46:11] closer to where they live

[47:04] there
[47:05] hallelujah hey manna in the message I
[47:08] live Haman CD hallelujah Haman God being
[47:13] misunderstood 1961 he said that's a
[47:16] reason people cannot believe in miracles
[47:19] today they don't have anything to
[47:23] believe with
[47:25] amen and they'll say to you I don't see
[47:28] nothing happening but even if it's
[47:31] something you wouldn't know because
[47:33] you've got nothing to believe God with
[47:37] amen
[47:39] hallelu Lori they've got to have
[47:43] something in there to believe with and
[47:47] when the Spirit of God is in a man he
[47:50] will say amen to every word of God the
[47:54] unbelievers got nothing to say men about
[47:57] because there's nothing in him
[47:59] reflecting back to the word is awry you
[48:03] see when the word is preached or
[48:05] believer

[48:35] amen from a turnip amen it might have a
[48:40] red substance because there's no blood
[48:44] in it
[48:44] so that's all the same way you can't get
[48:48] belief out of unbelief because there's
[48:51] nothing there to believe with and I said
[48:55] I don't believe in divine healing no
[48:57] matter what you say certainly it's not
[49:00] for him the only to those who can
[49:04] believe it is arrived amen can you
[49:09] imagine there was people back there
[49:12] staying brother branham's meeting they
[49:15] saw the miracles and the signs and all
[49:18] and I still don't believe amen
[49:22] they still don't believe hallelujah you
[49:26] can't get them to believe because
[49:28] there's nothing in them to believe God's
[49:32] Word is awry let me say this you the
[49:36] only reason you believe
[49:37] is because God plays something there for
[49:40] you to believe his word hallelujah
[49:44] without data taming your carnal
[49:48] understanding your carnal state can take
[49:51] God's Word you don't want it Amen
[49:56] hallelujah Chris Christ 1955 how can you
[50:03] believe when there's nothing in there to
[50:05] believe with how can you get blood from
[50:10] a turnip when there's no blood and turn
[50:12] it you've got to be born again of the
[50:16] Spirit of God oh you'll never be able to
[50:19] come on fellowship them in fellowship
[50:22] ground with God Almighty Himself
[50:26] hallelujah for it's only up on that
[50:29] basis of the shed blood does he receive
[50:33] any believer Amen
[50:36] an unbeliever is just an unbeliever is a
[50:39] rod and you can try all you want even if
[50:44] you preach walking upside down he's
[50:47] still an unbeliever are you there with
[50:50] me amen but you know Jesus said I'd
[50:54] rather you mean that cold and then oh

[51:38] borderline believer brethren you know
[51:42] why he said he hate the lukewarm because
[51:46] they're hypocrites to the Word of God

[1:06:20] for whom is called then he justified and
[1:06:24] will be justified then he also glorified
[1:06:28] Ezra it's not my business that the Bible
[1:06:32] said when when God hallelujah place Adam
[1:06:35] and Eve in the Garden of Eden he plays
[1:06:37] them on a hallelujah and a conditional
[1:06:39] covenant how dumb you know if you do
[1:06:42] this I'm gonna do this I'm if you do
[1:06:44] that that's not a type of the bride but
[1:06:47] when God called Abraham he gave him an
[1:06:50] unconditional covenant and you've got to
[1:06:53] believe that's your covenant it's not
[1:06:55] Abram if you walk hey brother if you
[1:06:58] carry lot no sir he said Abram I'm gonna

[1:07:28] somebody too quick and and fear and
[1:07:31] wonder if God's gonna do know run around
[1:07:33] as long as that is there you will never
[1:07:35] see the power of God God want somebody
[1:07:39] that take him at his word and when you
[1:07:42] begin to take God at His Word to the
[1:07:44] wall you look like a fool
[1:07:46] hello all they say you take too much
[1:07:49] upon yourself

[1:08:52] writer

[1:08:57] those things that were not as though
[1:09:01] they are theirs are ah amen I tell you

[1:09:36] received it into his heart by affirming
[1:09:38] he staggered not at the promise of God
[1:09:41] to one believer but he was faithful to
[1:09:44] the promise

[1:10:08] you can't make it in these bodies it's
[1:10:11] gotta be a change what God is obligated
[1:10:14] to keep his word and I'm resting upon
[1:10:18] that he's arrived and when the Prophet

[1:29:24] running the rapture wish you all the
[1:29:27] best
[1:29:31] hmm the hour that we're living in you
[1:29:36] know some believers even get so
[1:29:38] political it's the worst I've seen that
[1:29:42] believers now begin to turn against
[1:29:45] believers because of politics or profits
[1:29:48] and the politics of every nation is of
[1:29:51] the devil even if you're the greatest
[1:29:55] nation on earth Ezra you are not on this
[1:30:00] wall we are going to another one in
[1:30:06] Israel and I tell you if you think that
[1:30:10] the politics of today is gonna make life
[1:30:12] better or you're living in pimpest
[1:30:15] paradise man because it will never be
[1:30:19] better until Shiloh comes there's never
[1:30:22] a Superman is gonna rise but God will
[1:30:25] put it in their heart to fulfill as well
[1:30:28] is that right although you're a royal
[1:30:31] priest Lord you're a holy nation you are
[1:30:35] a peculiar people is awry brethren don't
[1:30:39] look further on the side this is all
[1:30:42] corrupted
[1:30:44] and cover-ups that has got a burn but
[1:30:46] there is another city that's where I'm
[1:30:49] going
[1:30:50] hallelujah I'm glad this world is not my
[1:30:54] home I'm just a possum true my treasures

[1:31:12] the bride is taken away in the rapture
[1:31:15] hallelujah the mark of the beast will
[1:31:17] come in and they'll have to seal their
[1:31:20] testimony with their blood but I'm not
[1:31:23] worried about that
[1:31:24] amen because we will never go into the
[1:31:27] judgment the true believer because we
[1:31:30] are already judged amen
[1:31:33] and so the unbeliever is here to judge
[1:31:37] you and they make believers here to
[1:31:39] judge you but but you know the thing
[1:31:42] that we want to say is that you know
[1:31:46] sometimes if you're not careful some are
[1:31:48] really true believers have not come into
[1:31:51] the redemption of the word you think
[1:31:53] that they are unbelievable hello
[1:31:56] somebody Paul say you have travail in
[1:31:59] pain until Christ may form within you
[1:32:01] now that's sometimes there's some real
[1:32:04] good believers when they haven't come
[1:32:06] into the revelation of the word yet they
[1:32:08] have not meet that day in that day yet
[1:32:10] and so they're a little shaky and a
[1:32:13] little that's why you got to give grace
[1:32:15] to everybody if we're not careful we
[1:32:19] start a separator and to saying you know
[1:32:22] damn my brother Keenan in your talk you
