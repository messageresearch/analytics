[11:08] that you'll give them fruit for their
[11:09] labor we ask these things in Jesus name
[11:12] Amen I was looking in the through the
[11:16] Bible looking for a scripture to to read
[11:20] before we get started so I think this
[11:22] one is pretty when we decided to go back
[11:25] to the Philippines you know we'd been
[11:26] three years ago and we had
[11:30] preached at many places and we were
[11:33] there for three weeks and we got to go
[11:37] to more places that we did this time but
[11:41] there was an urgency I thought even from
[11:44] talking with the
[11:46] brother Vernon brother Burrell brother
[11:48] Danny brother Nestor that there was a I
[11:50] need to go and try to strengthen the
[11:53] Brethren you know talk about the
[11:55] position give him give him some not just
[11:58] as they said that wasn't that wasn't
[12:02] Bernal ice cream so you know we vanilla
[12:05] is good but the pinellas plane so we
[12:08] wanted to kind of give them a little uh
[12:10] a little something else to chew on but
[12:13] here let's read the scripture for this
[12:15] cause this is paul from the colossians
[12:17] for this cause actually is talking to
[12:19] timothy for this cause we also since the
[12:21] day we heard it do not cease to pray for
[12:23] you and to desire that you might be
[12:26] filled with the knowledge of his will
[12:27] and all wisdom and spiritual
[12:29] understanding that you might walk worthy
[12:31] of the Lord unto all pleasing being
[12:33] fruitful in every good work and
[12:35] increasing in the knowledge of God
[12:37] strengthened with all might according to
[12:39] his glorious power unto all patience and
[12:42] long-suffering with joyfulness giving
[12:45] thanks into the father which has made us
[12:47] meet to be partakers of the inheritance
[12:49] of the Saints in life you may be seated
[12:53] in Lord add his blessing to the reading
[12:55] of the word
[12:56] I'll read you one quote I like this
[12:59] quote from Satan's Eden brother
[13:00] branham's talking he says the things the
[13:04] thing of it is is today we don't try to
[13:06] establish the Word of God in the people
[13:08] heart
[13:10] that was
[13:12] 1965
[13:15] let's just read this today we don't try
[13:17] to establish the Word of God in the
[13:19] people's heart we are trying to
[13:21] establish ourselves churches are trying
[13:23] to establish the doctrine of the church
[13:25] in a person's heart we are commanded to
[13:29] establish the Word of God Paul said I
[13:32] didn't come to you with enticing words
[13:33] of men that your faith might rest up in
[13:35] the knowledge of man but I came to you
[13:37] in power and manifestation of the Holy
[13:39] Ghost that your faith might rest in God
[13:41] there you are
[13:44] man mustn't establish yourself we find
[13:47] it amongst let God do something for a
[13:49] person and send them out you'll find
[13:50] every man trying to impersonate it see
[13:53] they're trying to with themselves every
[13:55] man I did this me I mind my denomination
[13:59] me this alright establishing themselves
[14:02] what are we preaching about ourselves or
[14:05] the kingdom of God
[14:07] establish the Word of God this was what
[14:09] I like here establish the Word of God
[14:12] take out the unbelief and
[14:15] establish the kingdom of God in a man's
[14:17] heart and the kingdom of God cannot be
[14:20] established in a man's heart less God
[14:23] made that man thus all right so we we
[14:27] wanted to that's what we wanted to do in
[14:29] the Philippines it's not that they don't
[14:31] know the word but it's like I told them
[14:33] that I was sorry that
[14:37] all the false doctrines they you they
[14:40] usually have on those in the Philippines
[14:43] come from America and they agreed oh
[14:46] yeah it comes from here this is where it
[14:48] comes from it comes straight from here
[14:51] because we've got all the knowledge and
[14:52] we've got all the books and we've got
[14:54] all the tapes brother Bob thank you god
[14:56] bless your heart
[14:58] that's good job Bob never hands them to
[15:01] me like that
[15:07] that's my little brother I
[15:11] like that shirt I'm gonna get me a shirt
[15:13] like yeah like a shirt that's good color
[15:15] thanks for displaying it for everybody
[15:17] to see but you know you you do you see
[15:22] people you go to your these different
[15:24] places and first thing you hear is the
[15:26] doctrine
[15:28] we're battling we're battling we're
[15:32] battling I mean you know it was two
[15:33] souls seven Thunder it's over there two
[15:36] Lords and the one I told you the other
[15:39] day about 14 seals they there's a group
[15:41] that reads in reading there in
[15:43] Revelations five that there are seven
[15:45] seals on the outside of the book seven
[15:47] seals on the inside well that's not even
[15:49] the way it reads so their interpretation
[15:51] of the Bible was wrong it reads there
[15:53] was written in and on the backside
[15:56] sealed with seven seals so there's only
[15:57] seven seals you know so in one of the in
[16:00] one of the classes I guess you might say
[16:03] and plowin is where that
[16:05] doctrine is the most prevalent
[16:08] I took him did my little seal
[16:09] illustration you know but I told him I
[16:11] said look there's only really one seal
[16:12] and they were really they'd really never
[16:14] seen it that way we're a grieve not the
[16:16] Holy Spirit of God whereby you are
[16:17] sealed until the day of your redemption
[16:20] so there's really only one seal and once
[16:22] that seal is open it's you Christ in you
[16:25] the hope of glory all right so it's just
[16:27] really one seal it's not it's not 14 but
[16:31] they're 14 - see there's always an angle
[16:33] to a false doctrine number one a false
[16:35] doctrine establishes the person that
[16:37] brings the doctrine not Christ it always
[16:41] established and exalts that person or
[16:44] you got to come to that group to get the
[16:47] other seven seals we know brother Brown
[16:48] preached seven seals well we got a
[16:51] seventh seal book you know the seal book
[16:53] the book book but they've got the other
[16:57] seven I said they do whoever these
[16:58] people are they're preaching it they
[17:00] have the other seven and you got to go
[17:01] to them to get that seven so one thing's
[17:04] for sure if you start excluding and
[17:06] doing the I me me you've got to come to
[17:09] me to hear this you know one thing's for
[17:11] sure that it's not God if you have to go
[17:14] to that specific place and listen to
[17:18] that specific doctrine then we know what
[17:20] that is that's going toward a cult so so
[17:23] we don't
[17:24] we tried to we tried to while we were
[17:28] over there I you know I knew about the
[17:31] seven thunders I mean the yeah the the
[17:33] 14th seal but I had never met up with it
[17:36] until brother royal explained it to me
[17:38] and then we just kind of covered it one
[17:41] day and one of the ministers meeting so
[17:43] but let's get started so the island of
[17:47] Manila I think I didn't go over this a
[17:49] few years ago but it's kind of strange
[17:51] that the country of the Philippines is
[17:55] so spread out there's seven thousand
[17:58] islands in the Philippines seven
[18:02] thousand islands three thousand one
[18:05] hundred of them are inhabited so you got
[18:09] from right here all the way down almost
[18:11] here to
[18:13] I can't remember where that's at but
[18:15] anyway right here all this is the
[18:18] Philippines and you really can't see it
[18:20] because there's little island stuck all
[18:21] over the place these are your major big
[18:24] ones but 3,000 of those islands are
[18:27] inhabited so if you get anywhere
[18:30] you got to go buy a boat or by airplane
[18:34] cuz you can't drive a car you might get
[18:37] a car I think you can down to right here
[18:38] but you can't go to this island or this
[18:40] on to this island that one or that one
[18:42] or that one or that one unless you fly
[18:45] or take a boat and
[18:47] this is an island we were on and I'll
[18:50] tell you about just a minute you want to
[18:51] leave just leave out right there but in
[18:53] Metro Manila
[18:54] Metro Manila is like metro Atlanta you
[18:57] got it lanta and then you got metro
[18:59] metro atlanta metro manila has twelve
[19:02] point eight million people in it
[19:06] and i met every one of them
[19:13] in a car on the road there
[19:17] listen there transit system is good and
[19:20] their bus system is good it's worse than
[19:24] when you were over there cuz it was
[19:25] worse than when I was over there they
[19:27] take and their lanes are four lanes on
[19:29] one side and four lanes on the other
[19:31] then they got a pillar in the middle and
[19:33] they got cars above you
[19:35] but they take those four lanes and they
[19:38] make five lanes out of it
[19:40] so it's five lanes of traffic all the
[19:43] time from brother of Vernon's Church
[19:46] which is in go back to the other in in
[19:50] Metro Manila which is just right this
[19:52] little spot right here it's where the
[19:54] four major message churches are brother
[19:56] Royals brother brother where else a
[19:58] little further out brother burden
[20:00] brother Danny and brother Nestor they're
[20:03] not but about
[20:06] 15 miles apart
[20:09] it takes you an hour and a half to get
[20:13] to each one of them brother John knows
[20:16] he's been there he's smiling sister
[20:18] Alicia they know man it's just pitiful
[20:20] but you know you think well there's
[20:23] there's like on our Martis system in
[20:25] Atlanta our Marta system in Atlanta them
[20:28] trains running these like like five
[20:29] people on the whole train not there they
[20:32] got a rapid transit and all you see is
[20:33] you see somebody's got a and he's up
[20:36] against the window and you see his face
[20:39] and 500 other people say this thing is
[20:40] just packed full of people and same way
[20:43] with the buses and then here you are in
[20:45] a car and then they have little
[20:47] motorcycles well John I told them if in
[20:52] America if they would get on scuzz what
[20:54] you do is you're sitting here parked
[20:56] like this or ya bout renting about two
[20:59] miles an hour and all of a sudden there
[21:01] comes a string of five motorcycles and
[21:03] they come down through here they turn in
[21:05] front of you they go down a lane of cars
[21:08] they go up we've I said in America if
[21:11] somebody was to drive by that the next
[21:13] guy would see it he'd purposely opened
[21:14] his door
[21:15] what and he said yes ma'am I tell you
[21:20] American drivers we'd win if we couldn't
[21:22] make it too much over there yeah
[21:23] somebody would open my door cause it's
[21:25] just like little bees you're sitting
[21:26] there parked and crammed in and here
[21:28] they come
[21:29] they come weaving in and out and it's
[21:32] just that's just the way it is you know
[21:34] you and the smog is so bad I'm wondering
[21:37] why in the world but you know what
[21:39] that's where God put them that's where
[21:41] God put them because there's 12 million
[21:43] people just in that little dot there's
[21:45] 12 point eight million people I
[21:47] mean there's a lot of people have
[21:49] scattered out on these islands and once
[21:51] you get up here we were up in here this
[21:52] is where Mount Pinatubo is right about
[21:54] here we were up in here the second the
[21:57] second day and
[21:59] the time before we were over here in
[22:01] this part this is where Donnellan is
[22:03] where we established or paid for a
[22:06] church to be rebuilt over here and
[22:08] several years ago and then we really
[22:12] just stayed right in here this time and
[22:14] actually I could say we want up here
[22:15] then we come back but those churches
[22:18] with three to four hundred people in
[22:20] each church three or four hundred people
[22:22] in each church they only live 15 miles
[22:24] apart but it takes them I wouldn't have
[22:25] to get there so you know we're happy
[22:28] because save you all are about 15 miles
[22:30] maybe right takes you about what 15
[22:34] minutes to get there now you'd go to
[22:36] another church it was close closer to
[22:39] commerce if you were there you just it
[22:41] blows your mind you know but
[22:44] but with all those there's believers on
[22:47] pretty much every island the say this
[22:50] part of the island down here roll it
[22:52] grant screen down to here let me see
[22:54] this
[22:55] Mindanao is probably the worst
[22:58] area to be in
[23:01] because
[23:03] this was a Muslim controlled area for a
[23:06] long time and now the Christians have
[23:09] started moving in so there was a lot of
[23:12] there was a lot of guerrilla warfare and
[23:15] guerrilla fighting but but now hey they
[23:18] got a president now
[23:20] shoot first ask questions later
[23:25] he put a bounty on drug dealers I don't
[23:29] know if you all know that or not he put
[23:30] a bounty on drug dealers and they have
[23:32] killed drug dealers by the hundreds
[23:35] and all you do is you just bring them in
[23:37] and prove that you killed them and then
[23:39] you get like thousand dollars or welcome
[23:41] pesos but yeah I guarantee you one
[23:44] thing's what they said they said you
[23:46] won't see a man out on the street
[23:47] dealing drugs no more if he's doing
[23:49] drugs he's found him a secret place but
[23:51] you know what
[23:53] it was so rapid till he had to do
[23:56] something so that's what he did and
[23:59] some love him some hate him kind of the
[24:01] way our places are there some love them
[24:03] some hate him so who cares but we were
[24:06] up there in Manila pretty much most of
[24:08] the time that we're gonna be in here
[24:09] later on but let's go to the first slide
[24:13] and also I tell you I didn't did I know
[24:17] I did that's going to bring you some
[24:19] money
[24:20] they have their real big Spanish
[24:23] influence and they go by the peso so
[24:26] their pesos are fifty to fifty two to
[24:28] one so every 50 pesos is one American
[24:31] dollar and I'll tell you something kids
[24:34] if you go to Manila to get a job which
[24:37] that's where most of the jobs that's why
[24:38] everybody's crammed in there when you go
[24:41] to Manila to apply for a job just at a
[24:44] what they have is they have a McDonald's
[24:47] on about every three corners and then
[24:50] they have a place called jolly beach you
[24:51] get that done but John knows all this
[24:54] he's been there we converse while y'all
[24:57] are all asleep he was the only one away
[24:59] so me and him as mr. Alicia would talk
[25:01] and
[25:02] but there's a guy that said well if
[25:05] McDonald's is gonna open I'll never
[25:06] throw three corners I'm gonna start a
[25:08] restaurant not as that's called jolly
[25:10] bees and it's basically a mirror image
[25:12] of McDonald anyway so we were there this
[25:16] was the last time I don't know if I told
[25:18] you but I'll tell you again for dead we
[25:20] walked into a Jollibee and there was
[25:22] like 30 people probably 18 19 years old
[25:26] sitting around with real nice clothes on
[25:28] and had a manila folder in their hand
[25:32] like this and then one or two would go
[25:34] in and come out one or two go in and
[25:36] come out and I asked myself what are
[25:38] they doing they said well they're
[25:39] applying for a job at this fast food
[25:42] restaurant
[25:43] they must prove they have a two-year
[25:47] college degree before they're even
[25:49] interviewed
[25:50] two year college degree before Jollibee
[25:55] our mcdonald's will even interview these
[25:58] people for a job and
[26:01] they make about
[26:03] maybe five US dollars a day
[26:09] about 20 about 250 pesos a day I think
[26:13] their average salary is like 1,500 to
[26:14] 1,600 pesos a week for a five-day week
[26:19] so that's that's not much
[26:22] but just they gotta have a two years
[26:24] college degree a two years degree
[26:27] prove they've been to college for two
[26:29] years just to get a job at a fast-food
[26:31] restaurant that's how
[26:32] competitive their job market is all
[26:35] right so and then you know they're
[26:38] working for less than $1 an hour about a
[26:40] dollar an hour sometimes so that's
[26:42] that's just
[26:45] thank God we live in a man we live in
[26:48] America and man we might have the worst
[26:51] we might have the worst this guy the
[26:52] other but I think I'll take here cuz
[26:55] they had no place like home
[26:56] somebody ought to write a song about
[26:58] that
[27:01] there is no place like oh but you know
[27:03] what is nothing to them this their home
[27:04] too so
[27:07] you respect that but yeah they're there
[27:10] economy's doing better but once you get
[27:13] outside of Manila it's not like you know
[27:15] we get outside of Atlanta and we still
[27:17] do okay we're all right and
[27:19] and such you know if you think about it
[27:22] think about even an average you take an
[27:25] average salary here of $600 a week you
[27:28] know on a medium scale
[27:30] that's thirty five thousand pesos a week
[27:36] they never seen thirty five thousand
[27:38] pesos in a month much less a week so you
[27:41] know they
[27:44] they live together and live you know
[27:47] brother
[27:48] brother Vernon's kids three of them got
[27:50] together and instead of driving an hour
[27:52] and a half to work which is only eight
[27:53] miles
[27:55] they all rent an apartment right where
[27:57] they work so you've got these big
[27:58] high-rise apartment places right there
[28:00] and I think brother John and sister
[28:04] Alicia I'm telling you that place that
[28:05] the the courtyard that you eat
[28:09] it's nice but what they do is they come
[28:12] in and see we're 12 hours different so
[28:15] their call centers because some of the
[28:17] brothers and sisters work at the call
[28:19] center their call center works at night
[28:23] because it's daylight over here because
[28:26] it today right now it's
[28:29] ten minutes till 3:00 Monday morning
[28:33] over there
[28:34] so they run their call centers at night
[28:37] over there because that midnight there
[28:39] is 12 o'clock in the day over here well
[28:41] that's when you get your calls you don't
[28:42] want a call center to call you at
[28:43] midnight
[28:45] maybe once
[28:48] but what they do is is they have this
[28:50] building and then they have people that
[28:52] work in the morning but then all them
[28:55] people leave well when they leave they
[28:57] turn the parking lot into just a it
[28:59] looks like a festival tents and fire and
[29:02] fryers and
[29:04] mango sheiks
[29:07] who
[29:08] anyway let's get back to the subject
[29:10] anyway so this place unit so they make
[29:13] this for the people that work at night
[29:14] and they come in and what they do is at
[29:16] about five o'clock in the morning they
[29:18] have to pack all that up and move it
[29:21] somewhere else so the people can park
[29:23] there so these are not restaurants that
[29:25] can stay there they're restaurants they
[29:27] have to be mobile
[29:28] so they have their grills and all their
[29:30] stuff but it's a really it's a nice
[29:32] place to eat didn't brother John good
[29:34] place to eat and you work not for you
[29:37] far from there didn't you you were right
[29:39] there to build it they showed me the
[29:40] building before you yeah brother John
[29:41] can look down and see see that so it was
[29:45] a good place - a good place to eat so
[29:48] anyway so let's get started we took our
[29:50] flight you can go ahead and pull the
[29:52] first person
[29:53] picture up if you want to
[29:58] so when I get to brother Danny stole my
[30:00] flight was good everything was fine I
[30:01] got my luggage that time
[30:03] hey man didn't get it coming back
[30:06] but this was waiting on me brother Danny
[30:10] del mundo he I stayed at his house for a
[30:14] couple of nights but we get in Friday
[30:16] night late and his youngest daughter
[30:18] which I'll show you in a minute her
[30:20] name's face you everybody remembers
[30:22] brother Danny a little short real dark
[30:24] dark brother that's them over there you
[30:26] can see him in the top so they welcomed
[30:28] me with this platter and they told
[30:30] brother Danny called me the other day
[30:31] and he said we haven't erased that yet
[30:32] so we want you to come back so I think
[30:35] that's really neat everybody's history
[30:37] Isabella she's kind of crafty in that
[30:39] way so but we went to brother Danny's
[30:41] we're off Friday night Saturday was kind
[30:43] of a man I had to get my I had to get my
[30:47] 12 to 12 figured out well John how long
[30:51] did it take you to do that a
[30:53] week it took me about three days cuz see
[30:56] when you arrived there I left Thursday
[30:59] morning when I got there Friday it was
[31:01] Friday night so you go past the date
[31:03] line the national date line is here in
[31:06] the Philippines is right here so they're
[31:07] at a different day than you are you know
[31:10] going around the world so flying there
[31:13] you gain but coming back you lose and
[31:16] I'll tell you about that later but when
[31:18] you do though when you land though at
[31:19] 10:45 at night your body thinks it's
[31:21] 10:45 in the morning back where it was
[31:24] 20 hours ago so you're standing there at
[31:28] midnight wide awake because you're your
[31:30] body says it's 12 o'clock the afternoon
[31:32] so Saturday I kind of slept a little bit
[31:34] during the day while they did all their
[31:36] work so I kind of get acclimated to the
[31:38] it took me about three days
[31:41] - that ain't really jet lag that's just
[31:43] totally something different than jet lag
[31:45] I've had jet lag but that a jet lag
[31:47] that's like your body's going you need
[31:49] to be asleep and then you're awake so
[31:52] but twelve hours difference it's what it
[31:55] that's what it does to you so let's go
[31:57] now to
[31:58] Sunday this is brother Danny's church
[32:01] he lives underneath
[32:04] land obviously land is at a premium with
[32:07] twelve point eight million people
[32:08] wanting to live in the same one mile
[32:10] area you know art one on one mile 20 or
[32:14] 30 mile area well you see a lot of
[32:16] things stacked up when brother Dale was
[32:18] there I think the church ended right
[32:20] here somewhere close to that well
[32:22] they've extended and make the pulpit and
[32:24] they've got a balcony so let's go the
[32:26] next and that's looking from the back to
[32:30] of the front like I said brother Danny
[32:32] lives underneath underneath the house
[32:34] then they have I have an outside
[32:37] courtyard down here so go the next slide
[32:39] all right this is when we first got
[32:41] started
[32:41] the first thing I asked them I don't
[32:44] know some of you may have seen this
[32:45] online but the first thing I asked him I
[32:47] said look you see all their songs are in
[32:49] English
[32:50] they sing no song in Tagalog or any
[32:53] other language all they're all of them
[32:55] come up just like this and they know
[32:58] when to clap huh oh the like they know
[33:02] when to clap I said y'all know when to
[33:05] clap and cry and everything else I said
[33:09] but then when I come out to preach you
[33:11] gotta have an interpreter
[33:15] how I'm really I was I was intrigued
[33:18] because look they would sing they knew
[33:20] when to clap they knew when to stop they
[33:22] knew when the crack goes it was a sad
[33:23] part of the song you know they knew when
[33:25] to worship but when you get a prayer to
[33:26] preach they go
[33:29] so that was one of my that was one of my
[33:32] questions that I asked him said why in
[33:34] the world can y'all sing in English and
[33:36] I have to somebody has because now
[33:37] brother Danny interpreted this night but
[33:39] all the other nights that don't because
[33:41] he hasn't a bit of an older group so the
[33:46] older group understands - golem and a
[33:49] little bit of English the younger group
[33:52] like brother royal has and brother
[33:53] Vernon's really younger and more
[33:55] educated they all are educated in
[33:57] English in the Philippines but they
[34:01] still have hold on to that and I think
[34:03] the guy look really if Christine was
[34:06] here its a mix between Spanish English
[34:09] Portuguese you just mix all that
[34:11] together and because I can I can kind of
[34:15] understand what they're saying knowing
[34:17] just a little bit of Spanish but they've
[34:18] had a real they had a real good Spanish
[34:20] influence actually it was they were
[34:22] Spanish colonies
[34:24] back when they got established and then
[34:26] you know we come over there in the 40s
[34:29] liberated them and stayed there two of
[34:31] two big base of Air Force bases on the
[34:34] island and we just you know flooded the
[34:37] island in the forties actually I talked
[34:40] to a man
[34:41] there's a beekeeper friend of mine that
[34:43] he flew over there during the Korean War
[34:46] I don't know the Vietnam War we stayed
[34:48] over there in the Philippines because
[34:49] that was really close to Vietnam he said
[34:52] they were actually telling that they
[34:53] would be signs that said Americans go
[34:55] home we've had enough of you so
[34:57] but now they everything is okay so I
[34:59] didn't feel I felt just as home there as
[35:02] I do here so next slide
[35:05] all right that's when we're getting
[35:07] ready to just keep going
[35:09] that's brother Danny that's beside
[35:17] [Music]
[35:21] that's the people
[35:23] [Music]
[35:37] they put air conditioners in see the air
[35:39] conditioners in the top they helped
[35:41] maybe five degrees okay
[35:44] maybe ten but that's about it
[35:48] but that's that was Sunday he did not
[35:52] have an anniversary meeting he had a
[35:54] Thanksgiving meeting and
[35:57] there was you know that was people here
[36:00] and people down in the courtyard sign
[36:02] they're still good
[36:04] brother Danny trying to figure out
[36:16] [Music]
[36:25] [Music]
[36:37] [Music]
[36:46] okay just keep going onto that web there
[36:48] brother Danny we had a good time there
[36:57] [Music]
[36:58] [Applause]
[37:04] [Music]
[37:08] just going through that safer time
[37:14] I
[37:17] was trying to get the point even being
[37:19] over there you know you you got
[37:21] different levels and you got a you got a
[37:23] really preach to the whole group of
[37:25] people
[37:26] [Music]
[37:30] but you really need to
[37:33] be letting the Lord to do what you do
[37:35] because you don't want to hurt people
[37:36] but you want to make sure that they get
[37:38] everything hang on go back to go back to
[37:42] brother Joe Joe I'm gonna show this is
[37:43] this is daddy's friend and these were
[37:47] all little bitty babies when they were
[37:49] over there before this ability o Joe and
[37:51] his wife he drove down around everywhere
[37:53] he went while he was over there so he he
[37:56] decided to be my driver he'd come pick
[37:58] me up at the airport and he drove me
[38:00] around so and I think his his roof was
[38:03] leaking so bad that then I think brother
[38:05] Dale do you paid to put a roof on his
[38:06] house didn't you yeah so he's still
[38:08] there after about 14 years they're still
[38:11] there so that's the EM they said to tell
[38:13] you all hello brother Joe Joe is
[38:16] actually brother and sister Isabella's
[38:18] brother and
[38:20] they live right there at the church so
[38:23] all right keep going this is sister
[38:25] faith this is this is sister Isabella's
[38:29] youngest kid she is like she's crazy
[38:31] see what I mean it gets worse
[38:37] that's what that's her telling y'all
[38:39] hello oh
[38:42] they were I guess they were showing from
[38:45] here
[38:47] to over here
[38:49] the airplane flight took me to Seattle
[38:51] from Seattle we went around this way to
[38:55] say and I'm telling you if you ever want
[38:57] to fly to South Korea I had a problem I
[39:00] thought maybe when I flew in South Korea
[39:02] it was going to be like they were gonna
[39:04] have to get the goats and the cows off
[39:06] the runway it's the most beautiful
[39:08] airport I've ever seen in my life way
[39:10] prettier than they got gardens and trees
[39:13] growing in there really really nice
[39:15] people
[39:16] but Korean air is a different situation
[39:19] anyway Korean air is Korean hot air
[39:25] because from South Korea then we stayed
[39:28] for a state for an hour there last time
[39:30] I flew into Japan and flew but we flew
[39:32] in himself I flew in here to save a
[39:33] little money but you fly in here another
[39:36] five hours to get to the Philippines
[39:37] there was zero
[39:40] zero air conditioning on that plane I
[39:42] sweat in places I didn't know I had
[39:45] places
[39:45] when I got finished I thought I was in a
[39:48] sauna sure enough I was bathed I was
[39:50] like sister Frieda oh I you know they
[39:52] tell you to take that little pamphlet
[39:54] out and read it you know in case there's
[39:55] an accident all these things you need to
[39:58] do and where the exits are I know what
[40:00] it's for now
[40:02] five hours I did this
[40:05] and the guy sitting beside me was
[40:07] American and he was helping every once
[40:09] in a while you know he but it was it was
[40:12] not good so
[40:14] you know how everybody writes reviews I
[40:17] used to never do that I
[40:21] did
[40:23] Korean air got a review but anyway
[40:28] it wasn't working but so what we done
[40:31] was is we took there's some of the slide
[40:34] there's some of the pictures hang on
[40:36] just leave it right there there's some
[40:38] of the pictures that didn't take
[40:40] because on well they took but they're
[40:43] sideways so brother Anderson couldn't
[40:45] fix them and I don't know why they
[40:46] turned out that way but
[40:47] after I we finished at brother Danny's
[40:50] we left brother Danny's Sunday night and
[40:52] went to brother Royals on Sunday evening
[40:55] he has a little know about this size
[40:58] it's got a bathroom and a place to sleep
[41:00] in his chair and and a table and a couch
[41:03] for people come in like me in different
[41:06] ministers to stay in so we stayed there
[41:08] Monday night Tuesday morning we got up
[41:10] at 4 o'clock in the morning now we
[41:13] couldn't get to we couldn't get to we
[41:16] had paid for a church to be built where
[41:19] Mount Pinatubo is used to be I mean this
[41:23] thing was a huge mountain and it's like
[41:25] half of it gone so it's just a flat
[41:27] plane they obviously everybody got moved
[41:30] away from it and they're called the Aeta
[41:33] at
[41:35] Indians tribe and it's the original
[41:38] there little old bitty
[41:40] the guy I met he was about this tall
[41:42] about 70 years old real deep set eyes
[41:45] and he he looked like a color uh negro
[41:48] he looked just like black kinky black
[41:51] hair but he was a he's the original
[41:53] Filipino tribe
[41:55] actually the ethnic tribe when Americans
[41:59] went over there in the 40s Japan was
[42:02] already there obviously you know they'd
[42:03] already conquered the island and
[42:05] the Americans come in a certain way but
[42:09] they met this tribe and that tribe
[42:11] taught the American soldiers how to
[42:14] survive in the in the jungles of the
[42:16] Philippines so they really helped him
[42:17] out because they do they're hunters they
[42:19] fit their fishermen they survive off of
[42:21] pretty much nothing but we went up we
[42:24] left at four o'clock in the morning and
[42:26] I say that laughing we left at four
[42:28] o'clock in the morning Kota brother
[42:29] Royal said it's four hour drive we got
[42:31] to be there about nine o'clock in the
[42:32] morning because you'll be speaking right
[42:35] around nine o'clock
[42:37] okay so we take off I mean we four hours
[42:41] we go up there like I told you we
[42:44] actually went past mountain to Penta too
[42:45] but we couldn't get there because the
[42:47] water was too high and they had not
[42:49] finished the church yet so we couldn't
[42:51] travel up there you had to travel in one
[42:53] of those
[42:54] jeep haulers that hauled troops
[42:58] you know I'm talking about where the
[43:00] troops sit on each side they climb up in
[43:02] the back there the this high off the
[43:04] ground that's the only way you can get
[43:06] there and we couldn't do that so anyway
[43:09] we went close to it and actually some of
[43:10] them from that church came down to the
[43:12] service but brother Anderson we didn't
[43:14] get any pictures of that none of those
[43:16] they were all sideways but this is us
[43:19] coming down to a place called Subic base
[43:22] yeah this is it right here sorry yeah we
[43:25] did all right let's see
[43:26] this is this is the active tribe brother
[43:30] where L brought two carload three car
[43:33] loads of people this is some of his
[43:34] people here this brother here the one
[43:36] taking the pictures but all these other
[43:38] you see there there these are all the
[43:40] tribal people
[43:41] some of them travelled several hours to
[43:44] get there but the funny part of it is
[43:47] we get there at 9:05 and brother Royals
[43:51] like we got to get out of the vehicle
[43:53] because you know they've been there
[43:55] started it at about 8:30 of they're
[43:58] gonna be waiting and
[44:00] yada yada yadi we get there at 9:05 and
[44:05] there's no one there
[44:10] so the little guy the little preacher
[44:12] guy walks up he comes out of a house he
[44:16] says all we're trying to collect the
[44:17] people and they're coming that well
[44:19] anyway at 11:15 we got started I
[44:23] said so this island is just like Jamaica
[44:26] if you say six o'clock that is just a
[44:31] suggestion
[44:33] don't try that here we start at 10:00
[44:36] that's what I told him I said now
[44:38] brother Dale don't make suggestions
[44:39] about time via Church I said when he
[44:41] says ten o'clock we gonna be there at
[44:42] ten o'clock or before no we got 11:15 we
[44:46] got started I looked over brother well I
[44:47] said we could have slept two more hours
[44:50] it's all brother don't worry about
[44:52] anyway so we had a good time with the
[44:54] tribal people there was a lot of people
[44:57] that did were not
[44:58] exposed to the message they were doing
[45:00] this outreach to expose the people to
[45:03] the message so I just did a real simple
[45:05] water baptism and a little bit of the
[45:10] Trinitarian doctrine and stuff just to
[45:12] you know get them kind of established
[45:15] and and we'll hear some more from that
[45:17] because there are several people but
[45:18] Subic Bay is where we come back to in
[45:21] Subic Bay is one of the bays that the
[45:23] Americans came in and built a big all
[45:26] this behind here is a big Air Force Base
[45:28] it's run by the Philippines now but it's
[45:31] all
[45:32] it's all Americans we built the base
[45:34] there and there was a ship yard and
[45:36] there was all kind of stuff it's really
[45:38] nice but it's called Subic they and
[45:40] that's some of the brothers now these
[45:42] people got up the same time we did these
[45:44] were sisters and brothers from his
[45:46] church
[45:47] that went with us that four hours up in
[45:52] four hours back they brought all the
[45:54] equipment they sang they have a mobile
[45:57] unit like brother dick has that just
[45:59] with the two speakers and and and they
[46:02] just set it up and then they had that
[46:04] meeting so eventually that was about 250
[46:06] people showed up for the for the meeting
[46:09] there with the the ethic tribe so that
[46:12] was Monday and then this was coming back
[46:15] Monday that's Monday evening we didn't
[46:17] get back home to
[46:19] probably 10 or 11 o'clock Monday night
[46:22] from that for our trip back because once
[46:25] we got coming back we hit the traffic so
[46:27] we were 5 miles an hour 5 miles an hour
[46:30] you know so but that's just the way you
[46:32] deal with it lets you sleep for a little
[46:33] while
[46:34] so now if you want to go to the
[46:38] go to the plowin map and I'll show you
[46:41] this is this place is
[46:43] to me it's a special place
[46:46] if they'll pull up that just I'll keep
[46:49] talking you pull it up but I'm going to
[46:50] show her where we went to because
[46:51] brother well and I left Tuesday morning
[46:53] early you can only get there two ways
[46:56] and that's by boat or by plane and this
[47:01] is the island here there's there's 1500
[47:03] islands in
[47:05] Palawan alright so we flew from Manila
[47:10] to here puerto princesa is almost in
[47:12] them in the middle of it and that is a
[47:15] tourist town
[47:16] called pretty princess port the Princesa
[47:21] so that's where we flew from there to
[47:23] here on Tuesday morning and then Tuesday
[47:26] afternoon is when we start our service
[47:29] now this down here is not very inhabited
[47:31] really mountainous this way it's
[47:33] 30-something miles long I mean wide
[47:36] 350 something miles to this one to this
[47:38] one and then those are included there -
[47:40] there was one brother came from this is
[47:43] the island of Corona
[47:44] if you've seen pictures of this place it
[47:47] is beautiful but coron island is off of
[47:51] Palawan but as part of the plowin
[47:53] province so they came in the people come
[47:55] from here the one I ministered the last
[47:57] time I was there see we left and come
[47:59] down into about right here and we spoke
[48:02] in a couple of churches and then we went
[48:03] up here and spoke in a church so we were
[48:06] there for three days but we did three
[48:07] services well I only hit three
[48:10] places but we had that one
[48:14] mystery Expo in puerto princesa right in
[48:17] the restaurant right on top of the hill
[48:19] and there was 60 people there and out of
[48:22] that 60 people that were denominational
[48:24] people they were not message believer 60
[48:26] preachers some of them are women and
[48:30] we'll tell you a little story about that
[48:31] too but some of were women and
[48:35] - I think two of the three women quit
[48:39] preaching and converted to the message
[48:40] but out of that 60 people there were 20
[48:43] I heard 26 I heard 29 I don't buddy
[48:46] somewhere in the 20s yeah that's a
[48:48] phenomenal number you number one you
[48:50] can't get 60 denominational people
[48:52] together in America anyway you sure
[48:55] can't get 60 message preachers together
[48:57] anyway but they got there was 60
[49:01] denominational preachers three years ago
[49:03] when we were over there came to this
[49:05] mystery Expo heard the Word of God heard
[49:08] about a prophet that's what I did the
[49:10] five comings of Elijah with them and
[49:12] talking about the the reason that the
[49:15] five comings had to be because of Elijah
[49:18] dealt with a good woman and a bad woman
[49:20] every Elijah that came on earth dealt
[49:22] with a good woman and a bad woman all
[49:23] right first one second one third one
[49:25] fourth one and even the fifth when you
[49:28] deal with a bride and then you deal with
[49:30] the other part you know so out of that
[49:33] twenty it's either 26 to 29
[49:36] pastor's converted to the message so out
[49:39] of 60 that's almost half and being
[49:44] almost half that's pretty good that's
[49:48] really good actually you just can't I
[49:50] tell you what happened you know people
[49:53] get a zeal brother as a brother from
[49:55] Ohio he went to Manila ten years ago and
[49:58] he goes back to Ohio and he's going to
[50:01] do this mystery Expo so he rents this
[50:03] big old building and he's got this you
[50:07] know he sense that I think he sends out
[50:08] like 200 Flyers to the denominational
[50:12] churches and wherever in part of Ohio
[50:14] he's in and he rents this banquet
[50:16] building and he's gonna feed everybody
[50:18] and blah blah blah one person showed up
[50:21] one that's how America is
[50:24] that place 60 people showed up on this
[50:27] island
[50:28] on this island 60 people
[50:33] denominational not even message
[50:34] believers they were denominational
[50:36] people showed up to go to this mystery
[50:39] active only way out of that
[50:40] twenty-something churches came out of
[50:42] that we'll see that's when brother
[50:43] Burrell called me back said hey I think
[50:45] we you know we've got 20-something
[50:47] churches and we're trying to get them
[50:48] establishing and thus and so and so I
[50:53] told him I said well that was my whole
[50:54] point of going back I knew I didn't have
[50:57] three weeks like I did last time I only
[50:59] had a couple of weeks on you I needed to
[51:00] spend some time in Manila but I wanted
[51:02] to spend three days here well the only
[51:03] way I could spend three days here and
[51:06] have any impact on those preachers
[51:11] pastors and preachers was to bring them
[51:14] all into one location so so we you all
[51:18] the church brother Dale paid for us to
[51:22] bring them in by bus and by
[51:26] whatever how they could get there and we
[51:29] fed them a few meals rented this place
[51:32] and I believe we really had a good
[51:35] impact on what went on because I didn't
[51:39] have to travel all over the island
[51:40] number one number two we were all then
[51:44] you can go ahead and pull it up if you
[51:44] want to where we were this restaurant
[51:48] now this is a different place than where
[51:49] we were this is enclosed it does have an
[51:52] air-conditioner
[51:54] set it about 90
[51:58] set it about 90 because that's about
[52:01] what it was but it was about 99 outside
[52:03] so it felt pretty good but these are all
[52:05] now some of them brought their wives
[52:07] they we're not supposed to do that but
[52:08] some of them just like us don't pay
[52:11] attention so some up but most of these
[52:13] all are message
[52:16] ministers now they have converted this
[52:18] is all message people they have
[52:20] converted to the message and they were
[52:22] in that some of the time at several of
[52:25] the twenty-something that come out some
[52:27] of these traveled and you'll see some of
[52:29] the tribal people go to the next slide
[52:32] okay
[52:34] [Music]
[52:44] this brother right here is the brother
[52:48] that's way down in South Palau and he's
[52:50] wondering I don't I told you about him
[52:52] because when we did the mystery Expo he
[52:55] had just just within the last month of
[52:58] being there came out of a
[53:02] denominational sure he was a Dean of a
[53:04] denominational Bible College him and his
[53:08] wife he was the Dean he feels real good
[53:10] at speaks real good English they had a
[53:13] house
[53:15] job
[53:17] place to work he accepted the message in
[53:21] within a month he was kicked out of the
[53:24] school and he was kicked out of his
[53:26] house they wasn't his house it was a
[53:28] house of the denomination they kicked
[53:30] him completely out well thanks to some
[53:32] of you brothers sitting here today
[53:36] you sent him enough funds to build him a
[53:38] church and it is I couldn't get a
[53:40] picture of it I tried of course we
[53:42] didn't go there but somebody had a
[53:43] picture and I wanted to get it but they
[53:45] never send it to me so but it is a I
[53:48] mean they sit on bamboo seats and it's
[53:51] probably about half the size of this and
[53:54] it's just bamboo strips for the walls
[53:57] and that's for the roof but it was about
[54:00] twenty two hundred dollars some of you
[54:01] brothers gave so now he has a church but
[54:04] he still does work I called him today
[54:06] before I left and he was huffing and
[54:08] puffing I said brother head what are you
[54:09] doing he said I'm climbing up a mountain
[54:10] going to see some people up and there's
[54:12] no roads eight-hour walk no roads going
[54:15] to visit the church they had established
[54:17] in the southern part of the island now
[54:19] this is brother Leto solo all of y'all
[54:22] most y'all remember Fantasy Island de
[54:25] plane de plane he looks just like he
[54:28] reminds me of
[54:29] but now when you say that over there
[54:31] they look at you like what are you
[54:32] talking about but he reminds me of that
[54:35] always always say duh blame but that's
[54:37] brother Leto solo we give him money
[54:39] every month and I'm telling you this guy
[54:41] is a worker he eats sleeps and breathes
[54:45] the message of the hour and he's a real
[54:48] good brother and he speaks then he
[54:51] speaks like eight different languages
[54:52] the island of Palawan has eight
[54:53] different dialects of one language so
[54:56] when you go in different parts you have
[54:58] to speak it he speaks them all so he's
[54:59] well received in Palau and he does do
[55:03] work in Mindanao he does do work in
[55:06] Manila but he's he's everywhere so we
[55:09] support him monthly with amount of money
[55:12] that some of us couldn't live off a week
[55:14] with he lives off a month so
[55:17] but you know what I finally got to meet
[55:19] his wife and I told her I said you know
[55:22] I was thinking in my mind I said I met
[55:24] you probably as much as your you met
[55:25] your husband in three years because he
[55:28] had not seen her in three months
[55:29] when we were over there three years ago
[55:32] we had not brother Leto was in Palau in
[55:34] for three months and he hadn't seen his
[55:35] wife in three months that's just the way
[55:38] they are in it well that brother Rolando
[55:41] brothers land land that came here his
[55:43] wife had a baby while he was gone didn't
[55:46] think a thing about it
[55:48] they're just a little different than we
[55:50] are yes but they have a passion for this
[55:52] message of the hour I promise you that
[55:53] and that's their life they cut
[55:55] everything out except that so let's go
[55:57] ahead and play that
[56:00] this is their saying you know these are
[56:02] all message pastors and preachers
[56:06] at the moment
[56:11] they're singing in English
[56:21] [Music]

[56:50] and they all come to one place we fed
[56:51] them lunch that day

[57:05] that's brother royal talking go to the
[57:07] next slide this brother right here I was
[57:11] making a point about something and this
[57:13] brother right here he he rides a
[57:15] motorcycle and he goes to church this
[57:17] church he's an evangelist but I want you
[57:19] to look that's his quote book I know
[57:23] somebody can't see that but he
[57:24] physically wrote quotes from brother
[57:27] Branham in this book
[57:29] can you make it a little bit bigger and
[57:32] yeah there you go he's got his Bible
[57:34] he's got it underlined and you know
[57:37] colored but he's reading quotes all for
[57:39] this book
[57:43] about that all right you do what you got
[57:47] to do all right let's come and that's
[57:50] his dad actually his daddy is one it's
[57:52] the 81 year old man now holder I expand
[57:54] it so we're in the middle of this this
[57:58] I'm up here speaking so we're in the
[57:59] middle of this of this thing I had that
[58:03] there everybody was sitting down except
[58:05] this brother right here
[58:07] this brother here he comes walking in
[58:10] and I said god bless you brother you
[58:11] look like a message believer to me I
[58:12] mean get short hair and didn't have an
[58:14] earring where he wasn't supposed to have
[58:16] it so he comes in and sits down well
[58:18] here I am and I'm talking and we're
[58:20] discussing how that
[58:23] God had through brother Branham had
[58:26] restored the faith of the fathers which
[58:28] were the original doctrines of water
[58:31] baptism no eternal hell no Trinitarian
[58:34] doctrine you know water baptism the name
[58:36] of Lord Jesus Christ brought all the
[58:38] major doctrines back well everybody was
[58:39] a man and in there you know they're
[58:41] reading their Bible and they're
[58:42] following me all through this and look
[58:45] they all have cell phones though
[58:48] they might not have a car if they got a
[58:50] cell phone but actually they have the
[58:53] message and the Bible in their cell
[58:55] phone so they carry that with them and
[58:57] that's what he's doing he's he's
[58:58] following me as we're reading the Bible
[59:00] so and it's like I was telling you
[59:02] before
[59:03] when I went over there I just really I
[59:07] took some quotes and I took some sermons
[59:09] but I really just didn't didn't read any
[59:13] quotes from brother Branham
[59:14] simply because
[59:17] these people some of them don't have all
[59:19] the quotes so we just stayed in the
[59:21] Bible but anyway so keep going so this
[59:24] brother keeps going keeps up now this is
[59:27] the same brother again now
[59:29] let me give you a secret you see this

[1:00:18] Crick's dale or something old public
[1:00:20] market I don't know where he got that
[1:00:22] from that's his wife sitting behind him
[1:00:24] she had a question too she only has she
[1:00:27] had her arm took off because the cancer
[1:00:28] so she didn't have but a half arm we
[1:00:31] were talking about the second session we
[1:00:32] were talking about the change of the
[1:00:33] body because somebody to ask the
[1:00:34] question about it and she held that nub
[1:00:37] up she said well I have this I said no
[1:00:39] you won't have that no I see you won't
[1:00:42] have that all right go ahead
[1:00:44] so anyway that was after the first
[1:00:46] session but let me take go back just
[1:00:50] state leave it right there that's where
[1:00:51] we stayed that's kind of the bamboo but
[1:00:52] that guy that brother that was sitting
[1:00:54] over here when I got finished I said is
[1:00:57] there anybody got any questions I
[1:01:03] said brother
[1:01:05] what do you got he looked down he said
[1:01:08] what do you mean about this father son
[1:01:11] Holy Ghost baptism
[1:01:13] number two what do you mean there's no
[1:01:16] eternal hell I thought right then this
[1:01:18] guy in a message believer he said in
[1:01:20] number three he said what about he said
[1:01:22] what about this Trinitarian you know
[1:01:24] that brother about the Trinitarian
[1:01:26] doctrine
[1:01:27] so I went through and I explained and
[1:01:30] then that's when these other brothers
[1:01:32] began to help me explain to this brother
[1:01:34] about the major doctrines because he was
[1:01:38] a
[1:01:39] Trinitarian he was a I don't know what
[1:01:43] denomination he was but to tell you a
[1:01:45] little story
[1:01:47] when we got finished now eating a knew
[1:01:50] his Bible because he would say well what
[1:01:52] about what about the on the River Jordan
[1:01:54] where the Dove and the voice and there
[1:01:56] stands Jesus well that's the one
[1:01:58] Trinitarians use all the time you know
[1:02:00] you got the father talking out from here
[1:02:02] and and the Dove coming down the Holy
[1:02:04] Spirit and even the Father Son Holy
[1:02:06] Ghost baptism now though no eternal hell
[1:02:08] when he had a lot of scriptures about
[1:02:10] where the worm never dies and forever
[1:02:11] and ever and that's when this other
[1:02:13] brother got up and started helping me
[1:02:15] out with the
[1:02:16] with the one about the no eternal hell
[1:02:18] because he went through the Bible a
[1:02:19] little more than I D because I didn't
[1:02:20] think we had enough time but anyway
[1:02:23] after we got finished we come to find
[1:02:25] out back when General Marcos took over
[1:02:29] the Philippines and and created martial
[1:02:32] law
[1:02:33] he was a
[1:02:35] rebel against that so he was a Marxist
[1:02:38] and that's why he was so if you'll read
[1:02:41] about it read about Marx he was under
[1:02:43] the Marxist doctrine so he was he was
[1:02:47] comfortable with confrontation he didn't
[1:02:50] mind it cuz soon as I got you know as
[1:02:51] soon as I said anybody got a question
[1:02:53] I'm is like a spring went off you know
[1:02:55] and then he won't any sat there just
[1:02:58] like that though and he said go now what
[1:02:59] about and what about swimming well after
[1:03:01] about an hour

[1:03:07] your Bible he said god bless you thank
[1:03:10] you I'll you know I'll think on these
[1:03:12] things

[1:03:17] walks back around and I'm shaking
[1:03:19] everybody's hand to go out brother well
[1:03:21] and I were standing there together and
[1:03:22] he looked at us and he said I've never
[1:03:25] run across the denomination like yours I
[1:03:29] thought well at least things I said were
[1:03:31] brother at least you know there's a
[1:03:32] difference we're not a denomination but
[1:03:34] at least you know we're different and I
[1:03:37] didn't know if he'd be back or not but
[1:03:39] you know what he came back the next day
[1:03:41] and
[1:03:42] went through the whole session the next
[1:03:45] day and
[1:03:47] really
[1:03:48] was listening he was intent so let's
[1:03:53] keep on going I'll tell you what he said

[1:04:29] a real big resort town for people from
[1:04:32] Holland and New Zealand and all the

[1:04:52] seen before he did not know the day he
[1:04:55] was born and did not know how old he was
[1:04:57] this gentleman right here had to guess
[1:05:00] how old he was
[1:05:02] that's how far and I'll tell you about
[1:05:05] these brothers he brought they all came
[1:05:06] together and we had our session was over

[1:05:21] said we're not riding in an
[1:05:22] air-conditioned that cost a little bit
[1:05:24] extra he said they said because air
[1:05:26] conditioning makes us sick

[1:05:30] they all slept somewhere I don't know
[1:05:32] where they piled up at they all slept
[1:05:33] somewhere and waited till this open-air
[1:05:36] Jeep comes by and takes them for hours

[1:06:19] ever how many kilos and nails back then
[1:06:22] well he has built six message churches
[1:06:24] since three years he's built six message
[1:06:27] churches and now he's starting on his
[1:06:29] own so I took some of the money brother
[1:06:32] Ryan I told you I was gonna take some of
[1:06:34] your money you said to give it to the
[1:06:36] people so I'm just gonna call you out
[1:06:37] that man now has enough nails to build
[1:06:40] his church and two more churches
[1:06:43] for just a couple of hundred dollars
[1:06:46] two hundred dollars bought enough nails
[1:06:49] for him to build three churches with
[1:06:51] LEC's nails but anyway that was a that
[1:06:55] was some of the money that we that we
[1:06:57] left over there but he finally is now
[1:07:00] building his own church so keep going
[1:07:02] but they're all they're all tribal
[1:07:05] people you see how they look they're
[1:07:07] really dark and they're really short
[1:07:10] but they all the ones that came from the
[1:07:12] Brahe of south part of the island of
[1:07:15] Palawan and that's him that's when I
[1:07:17] gave him the money and
[1:07:20] to build finished his church and and to
[1:07:25] others a couple others this is the
[1:07:27] second day session keep going
[1:07:31] and this is there's that same brother
[1:07:35] right there he comes back
[1:07:36] right there he comes back and gets a
[1:07:40] load gets a second load and there's mr.
[1:07:43] guy got all the hair in the world
[1:07:49] hey brother royal myself now that's uh
[1:07:51] that's the front of the motel that's
[1:07:54] some kind of bird kind of like our
[1:07:55] hummingbird
[1:07:57] but that's this that's the the older
[1:08:00] man's son he's the one with the
[1:08:01] motorcycle I gave him some money because
[1:08:04] he was
[1:08:07] know that wasn't him it's another
[1:08:09] brother but I gave him some money for
[1:08:11] traveling
[1:08:12] I gave brother Edward something for
[1:08:14] interpreting because he interpreted
[1:08:15] that's the one that had the Bible
[1:08:16] College that now he's kicked out but
[1:08:19] thanks be to God you know how God takes
[1:08:21] care of people his wife started her own
[1:08:23] private school and
[1:08:25] they're growing in numbers so I said man
[1:08:29] I said you can't outgive God God will
[1:08:31] bless you because when he was three
[1:08:34] years ago he was a little bit depressed
[1:08:35] I mean even though you told the message
[1:08:37] of the hour and saw the greatest thing
[1:08:38] there was you know his eyes were just
[1:08:40] open to the revelation of the message
[1:08:41] but he ain't had a place to live he
[1:08:44] didn't have a job
[1:08:45] and he had nowhere to go they literally
[1:08:48] kicked him off the campus and told him
[1:08:50] not to come back when he presented the
[1:08:52] message to the denomination and I'm not
[1:08:53] gonna call the denomination cuz it
[1:08:55] really doesn't matter
[1:08:56] but now he's established his wife he
[1:09:00] showed me many pictures of his wife that
[1:09:02] had a got a Bible School starting with a
[1:09:04] little bitty you know little small
[1:09:06] children had graduations and all that
[1:09:08] stuff because they're really educated
[1:09:10] hmm and he still does work on the island
[1:09:12] that's brother Leto and this is trying
[1:09:15] to think of his name but that's the
[1:09:17] brother that when he come to that place
[1:09:19] right there he told us brother whales
[1:09:21] taking the picture he told us he said
[1:09:24] brothers he said I he said I've been
[1:09:26] searching for truth he said I know there
[1:09:28] was more he said I went to the job was
[1:09:31] witness he saw went to one of the
[1:09:32] Jehovah Witness meeting he said they
[1:09:34] told me to be quiet you know hit me he
[1:09:36] was outgoing he was a Marxist this guy
[1:09:38] was a rebel so he he would ask questions
[1:09:40] freely they actually told him to be
[1:09:42] quiet he went over to
[1:09:45] that was Jehovah Witness he went over to
[1:09:48] seventh-day Adventist they told him he
[1:09:51] couldn't come in anymore so he goes over
[1:09:54] to a Life Church which is kind of a it's
[1:09:56] a big Church in port-au-prince s that
[1:09:58] kind of like our
[1:10:00] Jennsen Franklin's I don't mean to call
[1:10:01] his name but you know just a free chapel
[1:10:04] this is called life church so he goes
[1:10:06] into Life Church and he begins to ask
[1:10:08] them questions about certain doctrinal
[1:10:09] issues and he was he was confronted by
[1:10:12] the Deacons and said oh you've got to
[1:10:14] attend our church 14 services I don't
[1:10:16] know where they got 14 maybe they're in
[1:10:17] the 14th ceiling I don't know but they
[1:10:19] got you got a you got to come to our
[1:10:21] church 14 services before you can ask
[1:10:23] any questions he said they physically I
[1:10:26] was standing up he said a deacon
[1:10:28] physically grabbed me by Lee by the legs
[1:10:30] and set me down and told me to shut up
[1:10:34] he said but now he said when I walked
[1:10:36] into your place
[1:10:38] he said y'all so graciously answered
[1:10:40] every question I had
[1:10:43] told me with the love of the Lord he
[1:10:46] said he said whatever you got in other
[1:10:49] words it's not verbatim but whatever you
[1:10:51] got I have never seen it before he said
[1:10:53] every denomination and all the other
[1:10:55] churches I've been to I'll ask them
[1:10:58] certain things and said it's like you
[1:11:00] know the plague
[1:11:02] he said but you with open arms he said
[1:11:05] you answered all my questions you did
[1:11:06] not answer him out of out of anger you
[1:11:09] didn't he said you answered everything I
[1:11:11] asked and he said I've never found he
[1:11:13] said if I've seen the love of Christ
[1:11:15] I've seen it today that's what he said
[1:11:16] come and so that's good enough for me
[1:11:21] and brother well now he's brother rails
[1:11:24] on vacations right called hadn't
[1:11:26] bothered me but I'm gonna call him back
[1:11:27] they exchanged numbers there is a church
[1:11:29] in puerto princesa but there's like
[1:11:31] 20-something churches in in plowin so
[1:11:33] he's got a choice there we connected him
[1:11:36] with one of the pastors so we'll see but
[1:11:39] you know as far as one thing's for sure
[1:11:41] he knows he knows that we're different
[1:11:43] and that's that's the only thing I care
[1:11:45] is that somebody knows that
[1:11:48] we're different it's just it's like
[1:11:51] somebody was saying the other day
[1:11:53] to be christ-like is to be a Christian
[1:11:56] is to be christ-like are we Christian
[1:11:58] enough to be crops like you know that
[1:12:02] and that's a true statement and I think
[1:12:04] we as the collective group because what
[1:12:07] happened was I would because of the
[1:12:09] language now he spoke good English but
[1:12:12] but his number-one language this Tagalog
[1:12:14] so I left them kind of this brother here
[1:12:16] you know he he said can I say something
[1:12:18] I just said sure I said man here you
[1:12:20] know you speak his language so he goes
[1:12:21] so fast
[1:12:22] cuz I'd have to stop and somebody would
[1:12:25] interpret you know not have to stop and
[1:12:26] somebody have to interpret but this
[1:12:28] brother here he just rhyming he runs
[1:12:30] down through the Bible about the forever
[1:12:33] and ever and about eternal and about God
[1:12:35] and and you know the guy really
[1:12:38] understood and that's why in other words
[1:12:40] everybody was in unison with each other
[1:12:42] there was no argument and in the you
[1:12:45] know the 50 preachers so he saw that and
[1:12:48] he saw the love of God
[1:12:51] not just by words he saw actions so be
[1:12:54] being seeing the actions he he really
[1:12:58] enjoyed being there so that was the last
[1:13:02] this is kind of when is this this is the
[1:13:05] evening we didn't have an evening
[1:13:06] session because we want everybody to get
[1:13:08] home but this is right at porta princesa
[1:13:11] this is the this is the tourist section
[1:13:13] all the tourists here and then that's
[1:13:15] the that it's just a row of mountains
[1:13:18] kind of like it is in Jamaica you got
[1:13:19] your big mountains right in the middle
[1:13:21] of it but that's brother Edward and and
[1:13:24] brother for the Royal so go ahead
[1:13:30] this is just a little video of them
[1:13:34] kind of little boardwalk places to eat
[1:13:36] we found a little spot to eat down there
[1:13:38] all fresh fish obviously bird
[1:13:44] it's just a nice place I mean it's
[1:13:49] really not tough but you go five miles
[1:13:51] out of the out of the city and it's back
[1:13:55] to rural
[1:13:57] huts and shacks people so you it's a
[1:14:01] it's a tourist place but it's all just
[1:14:04] right there close together kind of like
[1:14:05] it is and all the other places even like
[1:14:07] Jamaica of it here you go to Montego Bay
[1:14:08] and you go sorryy ocean it's wonderful
[1:14:11] right inside that's where all the
[1:14:13] Americans go but you go outside with me
[1:14:14] and brother Dale go up in the mountains
[1:14:17] up in there and you're in a whole
[1:14:18] different world you're in you know
[1:14:20] jungle so we had a little bit of crab

[1:14:37] wailing out like this so we ate the
[1:14:40] other we ate a unicorn okay anyway it
[1:14:44] was unicorn fish all right go the next
[1:14:46] slide
[1:14:49] then we had a day to rest we went to the

[1:14:54] conservation center so we just kind of
[1:14:56] took a day Thursday our flight went
[1:14:57] until later in the afternoon so brother

[1:15:37] these birds are mocking birds but they
[1:15:40] don't talk English

[1:15:52] it what the brother royal would talk to
[1:15:56] him in Tagalog like I love you into

[1:17:04] beautiful all right go ahead
[1:17:08] so now I think we are

[1:17:22] brother burden lots of to bishops over
[1:17:25] there I'll tell you about in a minute
[1:17:26] but see right here
[1:17:29] brother Nestor so proud he is now

[1:17:37] the Philippines he's he's a license and
[1:17:39] Archives bishop

[1:17:45] International
[1:17:46] and he's got a partner brother Vernon is
[1:17:50] now a license and there's Bishop they do
[1:17:56] that so they can move around the island
[1:17:58] a little bit better they can show that
[1:18:00] card and move around the island a little
[1:18:01] bit better and not hassled by because
[1:18:04] look anytime Council of Bishops of the
[1:18:06] Philippines that's not that's the name
[1:18:09] of the place that's not what they came
[1:18:10] up with that's the name is endtime
[1:18:12] Council of Bishops of the Philippines
[1:18:14] and it gives them rights to marry and
[1:18:17] give them rights to do funerals and it's
[1:18:18] kinda like you know in Jamaica brother
[1:18:20] Keith was was supposed to have one of
[1:18:22] them remember but brother skyress does
[1:18:24] the he does it under his license well
[1:18:27] they've got their own license now where
[1:18:28] they can do that so I'm thinking about
[1:18:30] getting me one but
[1:18:32] so brother burnin on Friday night he has
[1:18:37] a Bible study and it's at a whole listen
[1:18:42] I mean it's at a business not too far
[1:18:44] from that Center of where you were a
[1:18:46] couple of buildings over this guy right
[1:18:50] here is
[1:18:52] the like vice-president of the whole
[1:18:55] company and he got brought into the
[1:18:57] message about a year ago brother burning
[1:18:59] through some people connected with him
[1:19:01] and brought actually brother Royals
[1:19:04] daughter worked for him for a time
[1:19:06] because she's a she's a Waco civil
[1:19:08] engineer engineer so this is before the
[1:19:11] church started we're at brother burnings
[1:19:13] and he said well we're having Friday
[1:19:14] night service said just come over and
[1:19:16] you can speak for us because I wasn't
[1:19:17] gonna be there during a during a a
[1:19:20] weekend service go ahead next
[1:19:25] there we are singing in English again
[1:19:29] so now we're speaking and then we used
[1:19:32] we had a little board over here we could
[1:19:34] use it and I took revelations five and
[1:19:39] the whole theme of the whole part I
[1:19:43] wanted to let people know was just like
[1:19:45] I've been trying to tell all of you guys
[1:19:46] and all of us here we are not a second
[1:19:49] person of a Trinity we're not a second
[1:19:51] person of nothing
[1:19:53] we are the person of Christ made
[1:19:56] manifest in another form called the
[1:19:58] bride
[1:19:58] we are the I am of the day amen we came
[1:20:03] from God we go back to God
[1:20:05] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:20:07] among us this the word made was made
[1:20:10] flesh and dwelt among us and if that's
[1:20:12] too hard for you to swallow then you got
[1:20:14] a real problem because it's like I was
[1:20:16] telling them downstairs if we keep going
[1:20:18] into this social gospel that we've been
[1:20:20] in for 50 years I'm sorry of hair and
[1:20:23] dress and do's and don'ts and that's not
[1:20:25] in the other we're gonna sure we're
[1:20:27] holding those peoples but we're gonna
[1:20:28] just die and go by the grave and then
[1:20:31] it's just going to keep going but listen
[1:20:33] there's not another generation this is
[1:20:35] it so we must brother branham I did not
[1:20:38] take this quote with me but I've heard
[1:20:41] the other day you've heard it a hundred
[1:20:44] times and I've heard it a hundred times
[1:20:45] a thousand times
[1:20:48] when the bride realizes who she is right
[1:20:51] and what she's doing here but now what's
[1:20:53] what's another quote brother Brown says
[1:20:56] when the bride begins to say I and my
[1:20:59] father are one and these other things so
[1:21:03] it's obvious that they hadn't been
[1:21:05] saying it before
[1:21:07] when the bride starts to say I and my
[1:21:11] father are one and these other things
[1:21:14] the shuck will pull away well that's
[1:21:16] what's going to happen I'll promise you
[1:21:19] this
[1:21:20] church any church you see people falling
[1:21:23] away that shucks
[1:21:25] the original seed word will absolutely
[1:21:29] be the seed word and we will receive the
[1:21:35] seed word and it will not harm us to say
[1:21:39] I and my father one it will not harm us
[1:21:43] to say I am that I am
[1:21:46] but I know my position that's what I was
[1:21:49] telling them there in revelations five
[1:21:53] you got one sitting on the throne but
[1:21:56] you got one taking the book from the one
[1:21:58] sitting on the throne same person but
[1:22:00] it's just positions and we know our
[1:22:03] position where there's no way we can be
[1:22:05] the physical God
[1:22:06] no that's not what I'm saying but
[1:22:09] because he's inside of me once he goes
[1:22:13] inside of you how can you find him and
[1:22:16] separate
[1:22:18] him from you again
[1:22:20] we were separated we were alienated
[1:22:23] alienated from God before our new birth
[1:22:26] but by the new birth you and I are sons
[1:22:29] and daughters of God we are God made
[1:22:31] manifest in another form called the
[1:22:33] bride we are the I am of the hour we are
[1:22:35] the Joshua generation we are that group
[1:22:38] of people that's going to say I and my
[1:22:41] father are one now how close is that I
[1:22:44] and my father are one and these other
[1:22:48] things the show could pull away because
[1:22:50] you know what's going to happen the
[1:22:51] shuck won't be able to chew it
[1:22:53] Chuck won't be able to swap swallow the
[1:22:56] shuck will be have to pull away to show
[1:22:58] the true grain and the true grain is the
[1:23:01] ones that can stand in the end time and
[1:23:03] say I come from God I go back to God and
[1:23:06] then I taught him our little slogan
[1:23:08] who's gonna take a body change I am I am
[1:23:13] it's gonna do the body changing I can't
[1:23:15] change my body you can't change your
[1:23:16] body
[1:23:17] but the I am can change your body and
[1:23:20] when you become the I am on the earth
[1:23:23] because there's not gonna be another I
[1:23:24] am here I
[1:23:27] hope y'all catch up with us on my all in
[1:23:30] all
[1:23:33] he's all in all in in us
[1:23:36] this too this used to be owned by
[1:23:40] somebody else now God owns this Amen God
[1:23:45] owns this now the whole thing that's why
[1:23:49] brother Brown stood one day and said I
[1:23:50] found out I'm not the son of Charles and
[1:23:52] Ella brento now look he and take a body
[1:23:54] change right then right
[1:23:55] he died and went on by the grave called
[1:23:58] he was prophesying but you and I must
[1:24:00] realize that our mom and dad is sure
[1:24:02] that brought us here but once God comes
[1:24:04] in and I saw a sign in the Philippines
[1:24:06] and I should have took it
[1:24:08] it says we vulcanize here
[1:24:13] I
[1:24:14] should have took that picture brother
[1:24:16] John you remind us we ever go back over
[1:24:19] there I'm cuz we drove by and I thought
[1:24:20] what did that sign say we've all
[1:24:23] connives here
[1:24:24] remember brother branham said you
[1:24:26] vulcanized when God comes in he
[1:24:29] vulcanized itself with you but what does
[1:24:31] he do takes rubber and rubber and
[1:24:32] vulcanized it together you can't pull it
[1:24:34] apart no more
[1:24:37] that's why some will be able to catch it
[1:24:39] in some wall and there's some that don't
[1:24:41] want take a body change that's just the
[1:24:43] way it is I miss just this message was
[1:24:45] not to help us live better
[1:24:47] this message come to the message the
[1:24:51] Prophet brought was to change our body
[1:24:53] it was to change our nature and change
[1:24:56] our body and give us a new way of
[1:24:58] thinking now
[1:25:00] like I said that's the essence of this
[1:25:03] message the essence of this message is
[1:25:05] to get our bodies lined up with what's
[1:25:08] already inside of us what's already
[1:25:10] inside of us all right so that's kind of
[1:25:12] what I brought to them even the
[1:25:14] revelations 5 how that the book being
[1:25:16] worthy and the one that took the book
[1:25:18] was worthy so the book obviously must be
[1:25:20] worthy so we'll get into that
[1:25:22] revelations 5 Bella's not here but
[1:25:25] that's Bella when she was a baby brother

[1:34:02] you saw sit first when we were all
[1:34:04] meeting when we first got there what we
[1:34:06] usually do is is we sit down and you
[1:34:10] know me I don't like to just say
[1:34:12] it is what it is
[1:34:16] hmm I don't like to even like that
[1:34:18] phrase but no I don't I want to go over
[1:34:21] there with an agenda I want to go over
[1:34:22] there know what we're gonna do who's
[1:34:23] gonna pick me up I'm kind of like mom in
[1:34:25] the way that way I want to know what
[1:34:27] time we need to leave what time we got
[1:34:28] to get there so brother Nestor brother
[1:34:31] Danny brother burnin sittin over here
[1:34:33] brother Rael he'd always he'd already
[1:34:35] flown to Saigon so he was gone but
[1:34:38] usually we meet together when we begin
[1:34:40] and we meet together when we leave so
[1:34:41] this is at a Pizza Hut they wanted to
[1:34:44] feed me some American food before we
[1:34:46] left I guess pizzas not an American food
[1:34:49] and I said this is not American food
[1:34:50] this is Italian food so
[1:34:53] anyway but we met there and there's some
[1:34:56] of the other brothers this is the
[1:34:58] brother here that
[1:35:00] this is brother this is brother don don
[1:35:02] he lives at dingle on he's got a church
[1:35:04] there that brother George Quinn helps
[1:35:07] with this is brother that was he's in
[1:35:10] with in the military with brother Vernon
[1:35:12] and he's one it helped me get in that
[1:35:15] real nice motel that we stayed in so
[1:35:18] look these guys this this is a five-star
[1:35:21] hotel in a casino sorry but they bought
[1:35:25] it for me they all took up money and
[1:35:27] bought that room for me and
[1:35:29] it was I don't know how much it was but
[1:35:31] these two brothers are the this is the
[1:35:33] head of security and he's a deacon and a
[1:35:35] song leader and brother brother Vernon's
[1:35:38] church and this brother is the deacon
[1:35:40] and brother burners church I think he's
[1:35:43] a deacon if not he sees he's something
[1:35:45] important but
[1:35:47] they are the head of security for that
[1:35:49] whole in 2014 when this hotel was built
[1:35:53] in Cassino brother Vernon they called
[1:35:56] him in to do lay out all the security
[1:35:58] the cameras the video everything was set
[1:36:02] up by brother burnin so everybody in
[1:36:03] that hotel knows brother burning well he

[1:36:08] became now the second-in-command in the
[1:36:10] whole place the whole unit and he's

[1:43:46] be over here over here brother Danny's
[1:43:47] just a real solid brother just a real
[1:43:50] solid brother so we are pleased to be
[1:43:54] back good to be back Wow it was a good
[1:43:57] trip though
[1:43:59] but I wanted to make it so simple but
[1:44:02] yet we covered seals we covered
[1:44:04] revelations 5 we covered you know what
[1:44:06] enough wasn't any vanilla it was a the
[1:44:10] meat of the word that's what they need
[1:44:12] they need the meat of the word you talk
[1:44:14] about refreshing when you stand in front
[1:44:16] of 50 message pastors or preachers and
[1:44:20] none of them had been in the message
[1:44:22] over like five years they all came from
[1:44:24] those mystery expose that brother
[1:44:26] rollout went over there before me before
[1:44:29] we were over there he did some mystery
[1:44:32] expose then we did the ones when I was
[1:44:33] there and then they've done in one or
[1:44:35] two after that they they've gleaned 50
[1:44:38] new message churches that are like 5
[1:44:40] years and younger on that one island now
[1:44:44] me that's phenomenal it would never
[1:44:46] happen in the United States you know
[1:44:48] that but there it's just like they just
[1:44:51] keep giving reports of another church
[1:44:53] being built in another church being in
[1:44:56] other words being established and you
[1:44:58] know I kind of thank God that they kick
[1:45:00] them all out I really do you know if we
[1:45:03] sometimes if we'd get kicked out of
[1:45:05] someplace it'd make you feel better
[1:45:09] but with them
[1:45:12] it's the same word we got they got to
[1:45:15] grow just like we grow
[1:45:17] they do not have the facilities we have
[1:45:19] now we did give them
[1:45:22] remember we get wheat y'all bought 50
[1:45:24] tablets they have warm out three years
[1:45:28] they've warming it only had the message
[1:45:29] on it was a little tablet about this big
[1:45:31] that the message was on and they've warm
[1:45:34] out some of them said they just warm out
[1:45:36] and the battery doesn't even work
[1:45:37] anymore so we may want to try to discuss
[1:45:40] later on there was no no one asked for
[1:45:42] it it's just they told me that they had
[1:45:44] war some of them out and that's just for
[1:45:46] the message there's no other apps or
[1:45:48] anything is just for the message now
