[7:44] this evening
[7:45] hey man good to be back
[7:48] and no I'm not gonna sing
[7:51] well
[7:53] but uh good to be
[7:55] back home and we had a good time
[7:58] got to go fellowship with uh
[8:02] brother Jack Duff's church Sunday and uh
[8:07] uh brother Jack asked me to get up greet
[8:11] the people so I got up and told him I
[8:14] said well rodell's always said blessed
[8:16] is the preacher who can get up and
[8:18] testify not preach so
[8:20] so that's what I did but uh we had a
[8:23] really good time and treated us really
[8:25] well
[8:26] and I have a wonderful group of people
[8:28] down there
[8:29] and I've got to see brother Smiley and
[8:32] the different ones and I gotta tell a
[8:34] little story uh brother Jack told him
[8:37] before I got there
[8:38] he said brother Aaron will know your
[8:40] names and he said don't be surprised if
[8:42] he'll walk something called you by your
[8:43] name
[8:44] he said he watches because I've watched
[8:46] the videos and they when when you get up
[8:48] to sing they put your name on the screen
[8:50] and then they have when they put all the
[8:52] birthdays up they put everybody's birth
[8:54] name up at birthdays so after a while
[8:56] you get kind of learned people's names
[8:58] and faces and everything so it's like
[9:00] it's not like you got discernment it's
[9:01] just over time you just kind of pick
[9:03] these things up but uh wonderful and we
[9:07] had a really good time and uh got to
[9:10] fellowship with him some and uh
[9:14] we got to go see the property that uh
[9:16] brother when brother Jack was here he
[9:19] was talking about the the church
[9:20] property that they're trying to buy and
[9:23] they're believing and they took us by
[9:24] and we got to see it
[9:26] and uh
[9:28] we were standing in the parking lot
[9:31] and he said brother the Aaron this is
[9:32] what we're believing in for by faith and
[9:36] we're believing for this and I told
[9:38] Brother Jack I said well brother I'm
[9:39] gonna do everything in my power to be
[9:41] here for the dedication
[9:43] so
[9:45] you just believe with them so brother
[9:47] Jack asked us just to uh continue to
[9:50] pray for that situation and believe I
[9:52] said well brother I'll certainly mention
[9:53] that to the church so
[9:55] it was God's mindful of all things and
[9:59] he's got it all in control
[10:01] whether sometimes we don't see it that
[10:04] way sometimes it's hard waiting
[10:07] but you know the greater the battle the
[10:10] sweeter the victory
[10:11] amen so if you have your Bibles tonight
[10:13] we go to Mark chapter four
[10:17] and begin at verse 35 and
[10:20] um
[10:22] just going to take a little fault this
[10:24] this afternoon and also want to remember
[10:27] and mention
[10:31] Levi
[10:33] I know y'all
[10:35] try to wrap your mind around this Levi
[10:37] graduates a week from Friday
[10:41] so may the 19th he's graduating from
[10:43] high school
[10:45] you wonder where all the time went
[10:48] but uh so anyway you're all invited it's
[10:51] going to be at the Memorial Stadium
[10:53] there in Jefferson
[10:54] and it starts eight o'clock so anybody's
[10:57] a that's uh
[10:59] if you'd like to go you're more than
[11:01] welcome to go it's open to the public so
[11:04] I just want to mention that to everybody
[11:05] so uh
[11:08] I still try to think about that
[11:11] you know
[11:12] they grow up on you
[11:14] and
[11:15] and then all of a sudden you got to
[11:16] figure out what you're gonna do
[11:18] and the main thing is is not try to
[11:21] figure these things out on your own
[11:23] but trust God
[11:25] let God lead you
[11:29] and so y'all just continue to pray for
[11:31] him pray for us
[11:34] and uh
[11:35] but I thank the Lord foramen
[11:39] he's grown up to be a fine young man
[11:49] amen so
[11:50] I know there's many other ones that uh
[11:52] be graduating I know Josiah graduated
[11:55] and
[11:56] and
[11:57] appreciate the Lord for that and just
[11:59] continue to remember all of them I know
[12:01] there's many others that'll be
[12:02] graduating and so just can Lord
[12:05] I just uh bless them and watch over

[13:34] brothers and sisters all around the
[13:36] world Lord that we're able to fellowship
[13:38] with just a little portion of them here

[14:17] eternal vibrant
[14:20] what a wonderful thing that we can look
[14:22] to Lord
[14:23] Lord we just look for that day father
[14:25] just help us get ourselves ready Lord
[14:28] let us be what you'd have us be
[14:33] and Lord just pray for your fivefold
[14:35] ministry Lord the brothers that are
[14:36] around the world that Minister Lord
[14:38] Faithfully
[14:39] but we just continue to hold them up
[14:41] Lord just bless them in a special way
[14:44] Lord we commit all things to you in the
[14:46] name of Jesus Christ amen
[14:48] amen Mark chapter 4 verse 35 says
[14:53] in the same day
[14:55] when even was come he'll say us unto
[14:58] them let us pass over unto the other
[15:00] side
[15:02] and when they had sent away the
[15:04] multitude they took him
[15:06] even as he was in the ship and there
[15:09] were also with him other little ships
[15:11] and there arose a great storm of wind
[15:13] and the waves beat into the ship
[15:16] so that it was now full
[15:18] and he was in the hinder part of the
[15:20] ship asleep on a pillow and they awake
[15:22] him and say unto him Master Charis thou
[15:25] not that we perish and he arose and
[15:27] rebuked the wind and set unto the sea
[15:30] peace be still and the wind ceased and
[15:32] there was a great calm
[15:34] and he said unto them why are you so
[15:36] fearful and how is that ye have no faith
[15:40] and they feared exceedingly and said to
[15:43] one another what manner of man is this
[15:45] that even the wind and the Sea obey him
[15:48] amen God bless your nights you can have
[15:50] your seats
[15:52] and so uh not only take this little
[15:55] fault
[15:56] on
[15:58] Jesus said there
[16:00] he said let us pass over
[16:03] and so that's what I want to speak on
[16:04] tonight let us pass over
[16:09] you know brother Brandon says here
[16:13] and he's speaking in the message calling
[16:15] Jesus on the same you know brother
[16:17] random's talking about
[16:19] he said so now he said now we find him
[16:22] knowing that he had a great job ahead of
[16:25] him the next day that he was going into
[16:26] gadera
[16:28] in gandero there was a maniac a man who
[16:30] had lost his mind and he was there
[16:31] living amongst the Devils cutting
[16:33] himself a poor man who could not call
[16:35] for his own help
[16:37] and now we find he that his own his road
[16:40] over there and I believe he knew all
[16:42] about it the father had sent him over
[16:43] there and he knew it
[16:45] and now tired and where he goes back and
[16:48] takes this opportunity for a little rest
[16:50] while the ship is crossing the sea
[16:53] great day
[16:55] and be about this time of the evening or
[16:56] a little later they're crossing the sea
[16:59] now while Jesus went back to the hinder
[17:01] Park back in the stern of the ship
[17:03] probably went into a little
[17:04] room back there and lay down on a pillow
[17:06] and while they were arresting the
[17:08] disciples they thought now our Day's
[17:11] Journey is over our work
[17:13] our work for him now we take our take up
[17:16] our own task and he said let's just
[17:18] start
[17:19] pulling the boat
[17:22] so that's the count you know the story
[17:23] there where brother Ram's talking about
[17:25] you know Jesus comes and
[17:28] you know it's interesting when you when
[17:30] you read this you know after all of the
[17:32] the Miracles
[17:34] and all the work that Jesus had done
[17:37] and all the things that the disciples
[17:39] had seen Jesus do
[17:41] all this time that he had went with them
[17:44] and he said the father had showed him
[17:46] what was taking place because he was
[17:48] going to gadera
[17:50] and here he is he gets in this boat
[17:52] you know he tells the disciples he said
[17:55] let's go over Let's cross over we're
[17:57] going to go over to the other side
[17:59] well the disciples didn't know what was
[18:00] taking place
[18:03] but you know there's one thing about
[18:04] brother Adam said about Jesus Jesus was
[18:07] a master of all his circumstances he had
[18:10] perfect faith
[18:12] and being a man of perfect Faith you
[18:14] know what all things was in his hands of
[18:16] all things that when the father had
[18:18] showed him all these things he didn't
[18:19] have any worries he didn't have any
[18:21] cares
[18:23] why because he was doing the father's
[18:25] will
[18:25] and it didn't hold him back
[18:28] and it's an amazing thing that when he
[18:30] got in that boat
[18:31] if he knew the if he knew that the the
[18:34] powers of the devil were coming against
[18:36] him and they were going to attack and
[18:39] stir up the sea and all these things
[18:41] well you know what it didn't bother him
[18:44] here's a here's a you know it's such an
[18:46] amazing thing he went on there picked up
[18:47] his pillow went in the back of the boat
[18:48] and laid down
[18:51] it's an amazing thing when you think
[18:52] about how he was he just went back there
[18:55] and laid down and the other thing I
[18:57] think is so amazing when I was reading
[18:59] this passage what stands out to me was
[19:01] you know in the midst of all this storm
[19:03] and everything and it's filling up with
[19:04] water and somehow you know how in the
[19:07] world was Jesus laying in the back of
[19:08] this boat asleep and all that water
[19:10] where he filled up the boat
[19:13] and you know you remember the old if you
[19:15] ever seen the old movies of the of the
[19:17] ships that were you know everything
[19:18] slides to one side of the boat and
[19:20] slides to the other side of the boat and
[19:22] Jesus sitting there sleeping
[19:25] and you know Harold they are here they
[19:27] are they go through all these things
[19:29] that that are taking place but you know
[19:31] Jesus wasn't worried about any of those
[19:33] things he didn't he didn't have any
[19:35] stress on him he didn't have any worries
[19:38] he didn't have any any doubt about what
[19:41] was going to take place
[19:43] why because if the father had seen him
[19:45] that he was going to heal the mate if he
[19:47] was going to deliver the maniac of
[19:49] gadera then you know what Crossing that
[19:51] water had no problems
[19:54] that was not anything that was going to
[19:56] stop him because he had seen where he
[19:57] was going and he knew what his
[19:59] commission was he knew what his what his
[20:01] what he had seen the father do and so
[20:03] then when the father had given him this
[20:06] commission to do what the father had
[20:07] shown him that was going to take place
[20:09] when he went out there to do that then
[20:11] you know what all the other all the
[20:13] other portions of this everything else
[20:15] was peripheral because that's not part
[20:17] of what God had for him
[20:19] because you know what if God has called
[20:21] you to a place and he's called you to do
[20:23] something then you know what no matter
[20:24] how many devils in Hell come against you
[20:27] to stop you you know what you're still
[20:29] going to do what God has called you to
[20:30] do because you know the only thing that
[20:32] stops US Is Us
[20:34] we stop ourselves because if we will sit
[20:37] and listen to what the devil has to say
[20:39] then that's what hinders us
[20:41] but it doesn't hinder us if we follow
[20:44] what God has said
[20:46] now it may slow us down and we may have
[20:48] to take a different route or whatever
[20:49] but you know what we still go the same
[20:51] way we still overcome
[20:56] so here when we see how they're they're
[20:58] writing on riding this boat and here
[21:01] they are and
[21:03] brother Brown continues on and he says
[21:06] he said now then we see those things and
[21:08] have them thoroughly examined identified
[21:11] certainly he said then why do we get
[21:14] scared when trouble comes in
[21:17] and so he continues on he says now look
[21:20] now we got troubles that we can't remedy
[21:24] he said because he was speaking of the
[21:26] of the disciples he said well they tried
[21:28] their sales and the wind was too hard
[21:32] it blew them off they tried their oars
[21:34] and the waves were so great it broke the
[21:36] horse
[21:37] then they got in their their little ship
[21:39] so let it drive it was let drive
[21:42] they probably tied the Keel down in the
[21:45] rudder and when they did they just let
[21:47] it drive just any way it would go and it
[21:51] dashing and splashing
[21:53] he said you have to ride a wave in a
[21:56] boat
[21:57] he said you fellas in a boat that ride a
[22:01] boat you know you just can't face
[22:03] right into a wind like that right into
[22:05] the wave if you do you'll pitch your
[22:07] boat right up at the bottom so you've
[22:10] got to guide that boat let it roll with
[22:12] the wave as the waves roll you roll
[22:14] right in and out with it when you if you
[22:17] don't he's you're you'll feel your boat
[22:20] full of water
[22:21] so here they are in this great storm
[22:24] that comes up and they're trying to
[22:26] handle it in their selves they're trying
[22:29] to do what they can do
[22:31] and here they are in this massive storm
[22:33] and here's all this water and they're
[22:35] trying to fight and trying to manage
[22:37] this boat and try to control it and all
[22:39] of a sudden they realize you know what
[22:40] there's no I have no control over this
[22:42] everything that I have is is useless
[22:45] because you know brother I'm talked
[22:47] about Peter and them you know they were
[22:49] fishermen they grew up on the sea
[22:51] so they were they weren't rookies they
[22:53] weren't novices they knew they were you
[22:55] know very experienced men
[22:58] and here they are in a storm and
[22:59] everything that they've done is is
[23:01] worthless it has no power they have no
[23:04] control over this and here they are in
[23:06] this boat going up and down in the water
[23:09] right and it's starting to fill up with
[23:10] water and then after all these things he
[23:13] said well after everything had broke and
[23:15] they couldn't hold on no more then they
[23:17] just let it drive
[23:19] and then when they did the boat filled
[23:21] up they said it looked like all hopes
[23:24] was gone and there they was all troubled
[23:26] and scared he said what a time it was it
[23:29] was a it was a trouble that they could
[23:32] not remedy anymore then Fair set in when
[23:35] they found out they couldn't remedy yet
[23:37] and he said we've hit likewise trouble
[23:40] we hit trouble he said we've got
[23:42] National troubles that are that our
[23:44] nation can't remedy
[23:47] so we live in a nation just like them so
[23:49] this situation that they were in when
[23:51] they got to the place that they realized
[23:53] they were not in control anymore
[23:55] they had no control over there's nothing
[23:57] that they can do to control this
[23:59] situation they can't help this situation
[24:01] because everything that they've done has
[24:03] failed and here they are in this and
[24:05] that and so they think they lost all
[24:08] hope
[24:09] and they don't have nothing there's no
[24:11] way that they can overcome this
[24:13] situation here they are in this and
[24:15] they're like well you know how are we
[24:16] going to handle this
[24:18] and you know and brother Brian was
[24:19] talking about here you know and it
[24:21] begins to talk about the the condition
[24:23] that the nation is in and he said you
[24:25] know we can't control the things that
[24:27] takes place out here why because we
[24:29] realize that the nation is under a curse
[24:32] of God and it's in the plan of God and
[24:34] it's going the way that God has for it
[24:37] and there's nothing you can do about it
[24:38] because you know but we know there is a
[24:41] way out there is a way that of Escape
[24:43] that's made for us why because that is
[24:46] not our our future that is not that is
[24:48] not what's been termed determined for us
[24:50] but we have a goal to get out of here
[24:52] there is a way of Escape made because
[24:55] when all of the of the world is trying
[24:57] to hold on and trying to Sure up what
[24:59] they can there's only one thing that you
[25:01] can do is make sure that you're sure on
[25:03] the Rock of Ages because if you're not
[25:06] holding on to him because you know as
[25:08] brother random said brother brother
[25:09] Branham did you hold on to your religion
[25:11] when all the troubles and trials in your
[25:13] life when you lost your wife and you
[25:15] lost your child and everything else fell
[25:17] apart he's like no it me so the thing is
[25:20] when we get into Christ Christ gets into
[25:22] us and you know what that he's holding
[25:24] us because you know I can't hold on but
[25:27] praise God he held on he said God didn't
[25:30] look to see if I held on he said he
[25:32] looks to see if Christ held on him he
[25:34] said he was the one that was examined
[25:36] and if he was the if he was the
[25:38] sacrifice if he was the lamb that was
[25:40] that was examined and if he makes the
[25:44] Mark if he is the one that satisfies the
[25:48] conditions and you know I don't have to
[25:49] worry about it because he's the one that
[25:52] met the conditions that he that he
[25:54] fulfilled the the requirements of God
[26:01] when you know in in the scripture there
[26:03] when when Jesus said it is finished
[26:06] hanging on the cross when he said it is
[26:08] finished you know there's three that the
[26:10] word in the Greek there means means
[26:12] three things when you say it is finished
[26:14] what Jesus said it means there's three
[26:16] things that it means number one it means
[26:18] the end of a battle it means the victory
[26:21] of a battle
[26:22] number two it means a debt is paid in
[26:26] full and number three it means that a
[26:29] judgment is settled in court what Jesus
[26:33] said so the word in Greek when Jesus
[26:35] said it is finished
[26:37] he is identifying that he was that he
[26:40] was the victory because he got the
[26:42] victory the the case that was against us
[26:45] was settled
[26:47] and the debt that we owed was paid so
[26:51] when he said it's finished then you know
[26:53] what that all we have to do is accept
[26:54] that because departing has been given to
[26:58] us but all we've got to do is accept the
[27:00] pardon that's been given to us so
[27:02] tonight you know we we're we're the
[27:04] recipients of that why because as the
[27:07] scripture says we've been made more than
[27:09] conquerors through him why because he's
[27:11] the one that overcame he was the
[27:12] Conqueror and he allowed us to step into
[27:15] that so when he that he made the way and
[27:18] all we're doing is going in the way that
[27:20] he's made
[27:22] then all I've got to do is follow him
[27:25] then it makes me an overcomer
[27:28] but so when we stand in those things we
[27:31] realize there's things that we can't
[27:32] remedy there's troubles that we have but
[27:34] praise God we know the answer
[27:37] we know the one who's got the answer we
[27:39] know the one that's going to make the
[27:40] way amen
[27:42] and praise God that we as brother Ernie
[27:45] Villanueva used to say all the time
[27:47] we've got tomorrow's headlines today we
[27:50] already know what's going to take place
[27:52] we've already got we've already got a
[27:55] place to stand on the Rock of Ages we've
[27:57] already got and we can hide in the cleft
[27:59] of The Rock and we can be safe and
[28:01] secure where we stand
[28:05] man
[28:12] says the troubles we can't we can't
[28:15] remedy
[28:16] he said the thing is sin unbelieving
[28:18] evil
[28:19] he said it's just weeded into US growed
[28:22] around us wrapped the whole nation in it
[28:26] say all of these troubles the way things
[28:28] are going today
[28:31] you know anything that's anything that's
[28:33] good is called Bad
[28:35] everything is bad is good
[28:38] yeah
[28:39] and anytime you have any time you have a
[28:42] moral stand
[28:44] don't don't try to have any kind of uh
[28:46] morals
[28:48] stand about you
[28:51] and people come up why do you why do you
[28:53] believe the way that you do
[28:55] why do you believe that
[28:58] well you know what you know God's just
[29:00] love
[29:02] and God is love and you know what we
[29:04] just we just love everybody and just do
[29:07] whatever we want to because you know
[29:08] what there's no repercussions
[29:12] I was like what kind of world do you
[29:14] live in oh
[29:16] all right bro okay well it's like well I
[29:20] want you to climb under a ladder and I'm
[29:22] gonna take a five pound of hamburger and
[29:24] I'm gonna stand on top of the ladder I'm
[29:25] gonna drop it and and we'll see what
[29:27] happens
[29:29] well there's a law called gravity
[29:33] and if you stand right there that five
[29:35] pounds is going to be on the top of your
[29:37] head
[29:39] well you can't just wish that away well
[29:41] that don't exist
[29:44] well you know what it's still going to
[29:45] work every single time
[29:49] and so if you go out and you know you
[29:51] you get out I was thinking about brother
[29:54] Kern cutting the cutting the Hedge a
[29:57] week or so ago you know and then you
[30:00] know he was if y'all if y'all saw his
[30:02] finger you know
[30:04] if you if you're not on a firm
[30:06] foundation when things get a little
[30:07] wobbly
[30:08] next thing you know you get cut
[30:12] and all that you know all the things
[30:14] that take place
[30:15] you know if you go flying down the road
[30:18] Hey listen you get in your vehicle and
[30:19] go down the road just as fast you can
[30:23] and one of Georgia's finest along the
[30:25] way is going to catch you
[30:28] but you know it's like there's no con
[30:31] there's no consequences
[30:33] well yes there is
[30:35] don't pay your taxes and see what
[30:37] happens
[30:40] somewhere along the way somebody's going
[30:42] to come and want to talk to you
[30:46] why because there's rules there's laws
[30:51] and so and yeah and just like and God
[30:54] has rules and God has laws that he has
[30:57] set in place and you know what you're
[30:58] not going to get away and get by with
[31:00] those things
[31:02] God God has a way that say it
[31:05] I was talking to a man the other day and
[31:08] and we were talking about uh the
[31:11] scriptures and and so we were we were
[31:13] discussing about about our church and
[31:16] and you know sometimes when you tell our
[31:19] Church's Name Is Spoken Word Church
[31:21] people think that's odd you know it's
[31:23] like I told him I said well listen I
[31:24] said do you know where the where that
[31:27] comes from
[31:28] I said you tell me someplace I said when
[31:31] Jesus spoke
[31:33] he said if you say to this mountain
[31:36] be thou removed I said in Genesis 1 God
[31:39] spoke and said let there be and creation
[31:42] took place
[31:44] and salvation is made by confessing your
[31:47] your faults and your sins
[31:51] when you believe in your heart and
[31:52] confess with your mouth
[31:54] I said when God spoke to all the
[31:57] prophets in the Old Testament he told
[31:59] them speak son of man
[32:01] I said God never chose the son to preach
[32:04] the gospel
[32:05] he said he never spoke he never calls
[32:08] the wind or the waves or anything else
[32:11] to to create you know to uh Worship the
[32:15] Lord
[32:15] to preach the gospel none of that ever
[32:17] come through any other way I said man
[32:19] was given that we were made in the image
[32:21] of God and God wants us to speak and so
[32:24] if you're going to if because the only
[32:26] way that you're ever going to know God
[32:27] is through a human because God is in us
[32:31] to make the make himself known to the
[32:33] world he said because he said we are the
[32:36] light of the world and so you know what
[32:37] it's not it's not just not just getting
[32:39] out and trying to speak it but your life
[32:41] ought to manifests that now when people
[32:43] see that something comes out of your
[32:45] mouth it speaks to them and then he's
[32:47] like this is something different I said
[32:49] all of the Bible is based on speaking
[32:52] I said because it was the spoken word I
[32:55] said when Jesus stood there one day and
[32:57] he spoke to a tree and he said because
[32:59] it had leaves on it but it had no figs
[33:01] on it because when it was supposed to
[33:03] had figs it didn't so it was just a
[33:06] make-believer see it was just putting on
[33:08] it was just acting because it should
[33:10] have had figs but it didn't
[33:12] and when when Jesus saw that he said let
[33:15] no man eat of you ever again
[33:18] and the thing dried up and the next time
[33:22] Peter saw that tree he's like Lord look
[33:23] the tree's dried up
[33:25] why because Jesus believed in what he
[33:28] had to say and when he spoke to the tree
[33:30] it obeyed him
[33:32] and I said it's the same way with you
[33:34] and I I said why is it that when people
[33:36] come in this in this plant you see
[33:38] people come through the door I said some
[33:40] people they hate being here and every
[33:42] time you try to talk to them they I mean
[33:44] they look like they've been eating a
[33:45] bunch of green Persimmons when they come
[33:47] through the door and you hate to even be
[33:49] around them
[33:52] I said what do you see me do
[33:56] I said when I get here what do I do
[33:59] most of the time when I get up there if
[34:02] I'm not one holding the door I let
[34:03] everybody else in and everybody that
[34:05] passed his man good morning good morning
[34:07] how you all doing how you doing good
[34:08] morning
[34:09] and I speak to everybody why because you
[34:11] know what that's what creates a good day
[34:13] because you know what you create the
[34:15] atmosphere that you live in
[34:17] now you can be upset and just blow up
[34:19] like a bullfrog eating Buckshot and all
[34:21] that but you know what or you can create
[34:23] the atmosphere that you live in you
[34:25] can't control the environment that you
[34:27] live in but you can create the
[34:28] atmosphere and I was like you know what
[34:30] I want people to see Jesus Christ in me
[34:32] I want to say that there's joy
[34:34] unspeakable and full of Glory you know
[34:36] you know even when things get upset you
[34:38] know sometimes we have to walk off and
[34:40] you know we gotta we gotta pray through
[34:42] sometimes because you know what things
[34:43] get under our skin but you know what
[34:45] there's still a time that you know what
[34:46] because of that because God is an
[34:50] overcomer and he's inside of us and we
[34:52] can overcome these things that you know
[34:54] I want people to say that God is real
[34:56] that God is still alive and that he's
[34:59] still molding a group of people in his
[35:01] mind Into His Image in his character
[35:04] because the world can see all kinds of
[35:07] fakes and they can see all kinds of
[35:09] unbelievers and they can say all kinds
[35:10] but I want the World to See Jesus Christ
[35:14] [Applause]
[35:20] he said he said we tried to introduce
[35:22] the word Christ tried to bring the word
[35:25] tried to bring it back by showing
[35:28] himself the resurrection for 2 000 years
[35:30] he is still the same they turned their
[35:33] back upon it walked away they're
[35:35] unbelievers he said May Believers still
[35:38] hold hang on to find a fault with it
[35:41] just as much as they can on and on but
[35:44] what is it it's the same thing repeating
[35:46] again
[35:47] so what he's talking about the way it
[35:48] was back then he said there was three
[35:50] kinds of believers they were the
[35:52] make-believers the unbelievers but there
[35:54] was a real group of Believers a genuine
[35:56] Believers that actually believed in that
[35:59] and you know what when I read that it's
[36:01] like Lord you know because some people
[36:04] you know unbelievers they're not ever
[36:06] going to believe and it doesn't matter
[36:07] what you do whatever you say whatever
[36:09] you show them they're never going to
[36:10] believe that
[36:12] and you can't change them no matter what
[36:16] because God's tried to change him and he
[36:18] couldn't
[36:19] so you're not gonna do it
[36:23] but that's what struck me when he said
[36:25] make believers
[36:26] still hang on to find a fault with it
[36:30] and it is what that's what struck me you
[36:32] know here's my eight Believers what well
[36:34] I'm still hanging I'm around but what
[36:36] was it that was a mixed multitude that
[36:38] was with Israel and you know what they
[36:39] didn't have any good thing to say about
[36:40] anything
[36:43] you know it's amazing if if you're a
[36:46] real genuine True Believer and you
[36:47] actually believe that this is what God
[36:49] has sent us to do and this is the
[36:51] workings of the holy spirit it's like
[36:53] you can't find anything good to say and
[36:56] all you can do is find fault
[36:59] then you know what that's not the Holy
[37:01] Spirit speaking
[37:04] because you know what when everything
[37:05] goes wrong whenever there's problems you
[37:07] know what that's what that is part of
[37:09] the life that's part of as brother Ram
[37:12] said that's life's grab bag
[37:14] you're gonna have all these issues and
[37:16] problems and everything but you know
[37:18] what greater is he that's in us than he
[37:20] that's in the world
[37:22] so if we have all these
[37:25] problems then Lord let us not just find
[37:27] fault with it
[37:30] I know there's I know there's problems
[37:32] and we've all got problems and there's
[37:34] always problems
[37:35] but Lord let us find something to be
[37:37] thankful for
[37:39] yeah you know I was I was speaking to
[37:42] that man I was telling you about where
[37:43] he's talking about the word and and
[37:45] whereas I was telling him I was like
[37:47] well you know I was like when you're
[37:48] raising children
[37:50] I said when you get out there I said the
[37:52] one thing you don't do I said and you're
[37:54] a coach you coach best the man coaches
[37:56] basketball I said when you get out there
[37:58] I said how well do you think your team's
[38:00] going to perform us I all you can do is
[38:02] find thought with everything they do
[38:05] if you pull them on the sideline you
[38:07] didn't do this right you didn't do that
[38:08] this and that and but what do you got to
[38:10] do you got to reinforce the things that
[38:12] are correct
[38:13] when you raise children what do you got
[38:15] to do you got to tell listen you're
[38:16] doing good right
[38:19] now well you got to correct the things
[38:22] that are wrong but you know what you got
[38:23] to create them but you want them to
[38:24] understand this is the reason why we do
[38:26] this
[38:28] but you want to praise him when they're
[38:30] doing good
[38:32] you want to encourage them
[38:35] how many times when because how many
[38:37] times has the Lord spoke to you and gave
[38:39] you a word of encouragement
[38:42] even in the midst of of sicknesses or
[38:45] heartaches or problems or whatever and
[38:47] the Lord comes and brings you a word of
[38:49] comfort a word of encouragement and it
[38:51] might have been just one word that he
[38:53] speaks but you know what it'll change
[38:55] your whole life just by that one why
[38:57] that one little minute
[38:59] and it's the same way it's by you
[39:01] speaking to your children and if you
[39:03] encourage them to go that way then you
[39:06] know what they'll get better if you have
[39:07] a team and you encourage them you know
[39:09] what they get better
[39:11] because you know what if they don't if
[39:13] you don't think they are ever do
[39:14] anything right or you know then whether
[39:16] they wanted they don't want to continue
[39:18] right
[39:20] right he's like well it's time to give
[39:21] up
[39:24] but God don't want us to give up
[39:28] he wants us to keep going
[39:31] just a little while a little longer just
[39:34] a little while to stay here
[39:36] just a little bit longer than we
[39:38] we can leave
[39:40] it won't be much longer just hold on
[39:46] he said in the midst of idolatry
[39:48] in the midst of worldlyism in the midst
[39:51] of all kinds of confusions and mix up we
[39:53] still have him in the ship
[39:56] stay still in all this he's still in the
[39:58] ship with us he said no wonder David
[40:01] screamed out I'll feel no evil for
[40:03] you're in the ship
[40:05] hey man
[40:06] oh how they could see this so much that
[40:10] they had seen was not able to express it
[40:12] all of what they had seen
[40:15] he said now it dawned on them that he
[40:18] was laying right close to them
[40:20] and it says now he is a lot closer to
[40:23] you than he was then is that right
[40:28] so in the midst of all these problems
[40:31] and everything as they were in this ship
[40:34] and they were looking at this storm and
[40:36] how great it was and all the problems
[40:37] and everything that they were facing
[40:40] and you know after they had tried
[40:42] everything and they'd lost almost all
[40:44] their hope and you know they had no
[40:46] other way to turn then all of a sudden
[40:47] they wrote oh you know what Jesus is on
[40:49] the boat
[40:52] here's Jesus
[40:54] and brother I'm talking about in all the
[40:56] midst of all this he said it dawned on
[40:58] them but he said you know what for y'all
[41:00] to understand for us to understand you
[41:01] know he's closer tonight to us than he
[41:03] was to them
[41:05] why because he's taking up residence in
[41:07] us so he is and then he said I'll never
[41:11] leave you don't forsake you but I'll be
[41:12] with you even in you under the end of
[41:15] the world so if he's here then guess
[41:16] what in the midst of all the chaos and
[41:19] the confusion and all the worldlyism and
[41:21] all the things that are happening all
[41:23] around us praise God we've got a way to
[41:25] go we know which way to go because we've
[41:27] got to Anchor this steadfast ensure
[41:30] that's going to lead us the way
[41:32] [Music]
[41:33] I'm so glad that we have a place to
[41:35] stand and we don't have to worry about
[41:37] these things God's leading us
[41:41] see if we understand in the midst of all
[41:44] the things that have taken place so you
[41:46] know all these things that that have
[41:48] come against us God is still real
[41:52] he said I'm with you now and I will be
[41:54] with you he said a little while in the
[41:56] world will see me no more yet ye shall
[41:59] see me
[42:00] what because on the day of Pentecost
[42:02] when they stood there and they saw Jesus
[42:04] walking and speaking they didn't
[42:06] understand everything that Jesus said it
[42:08] was a lot of things they didn't
[42:09] understand but what did they say what
[42:12] did Peter say Lord to whom shall we go
[42:15] when there's no other place to go Lord
[42:17] we don't understand these things but we
[42:19] know that you have the words of eternal
[42:21] life and there's no other place to go
[42:24] and he began to encourage the disciples
[42:26] and he told Peter he said he said when
[42:29] he said the Satan has desired to sift
[42:31] you like wheat
[42:34] see Satan's coming against you he said
[42:36] but I've prayed for you
[42:40] and he kept encouraging Peter he said
[42:42] listen he said when you're converted he
[42:44] said strengthen the brethren
[42:46] why because he knew that through the
[42:48] Battles Through the heartaches and all
[42:50] the things that Peter would go through
[42:51] then he would be a testimony he would be
[42:54] a witness to the things that God had
[42:56] done and he could go out there and tell
[42:57] the brothers listen don't be weary in
[42:59] well-doing don't worry about all these
[43:01] things because God is is a is a god of
[43:04] Mercy he's a god of Grace and he's
[43:06] leading us on and he's going to take you
[43:08] all the way
[43:11] when Peter could stand there and tell
[43:13] the early church and you know when he
[43:15] could give his testimony and say listen
[43:17] I walked with him I slept with him I I
[43:21] ate with him I've seen all these
[43:22] Miracles and you know what I turned my
[43:24] back on him but you know what praise God
[43:26] he didn't turn his back on me
[43:29] and you know what he began the top one
[43:32] Peter began to tell about his will about
[43:34] his testimony when he'd been begin to
[43:36] talk about the things that he had
[43:37] witnessed in his life and understanding
[43:39] the grace of Jesus Christ and what God
[43:42] meant to him because what had God had
[43:44] done for him where he had come from and
[43:47] where he come to he's like listen y'all
[43:49] can come the same way when when Paul can
[43:52] stand there and talk about being a being
[43:54] complicit in the murder of Christians
[43:57] when his brothers and sisters that had
[43:59] died and you know what he had their
[44:00] blood on his hands because he was
[44:01] complicit in that in that act and he
[44:04] could stand there and tell them but you
[44:06] know what he said but the grace of God
[44:07] covers Us
[44:09] Hallelujah and so what brothers and
[44:11] sisters if you if you can believe that
[44:13] the grace of God will cover you too the
[44:16] grace of God covers all of us and you
[44:19] know what if we fall down praise God
[44:20] because there's a way to get back up and
[44:23] come back into fellowship and divine
[44:25] fellowship with God that we can continue
[44:27] on
[44:30] God did make us quitters
[44:34] God didn't quit on you
[44:37] so let's don't quit on him and say Lord
[44:40] I can't make it well praise God because
[44:42] in in our weakness his strength is made
[44:44] perfect
[44:46] we've got perfect strength when we
[44:49] realize we can't do it ourselves
[44:52] when we come to the place to realize
[44:54] just as they did you know what we've got
[44:56] Jesus on our ship and if we can just
[44:58] turn to him and say Lord this is what we
[45:00] have need of
[45:02] Lord do you care not that we perish
[45:06] well you know what he wasn't worried
[45:07] about it
[45:09] why because he was the god of creation
[45:12] and he was standing there and he was not
[45:14] worried about it
[45:22] he said I think it's time when troubles
[45:24] come on that we say to those decide like
[45:26] those disciples who must have said let's
[45:29] go wait Kim Let's Go call him
[45:31] let's call him on the scene
[45:34] he said oh my beloved brother my beloved
[45:36] sister I love you and remember I'm
[45:37] telling you the truth if you've got
[45:39] trouble tonight he's right at hand
[45:42] he has caught he can be called on the
[45:45] scene
[45:45] just by by just a move of your lips
[45:53] see
[45:54] that's what I was
[45:55] when I was talking to that man about
[45:57] speaking
[45:58] see if we just speak it
[46:00] he'll come on the scene
[46:03] he's wanting us to make that invitation
[46:05] he will come on the scene amen call
[46:07] Jesus on the scene wake Jesus
[46:09] for we have him with us he is the same
[46:12] yesterday today and forever
[46:16] So He is wanting us to come in because
[46:18] he desires to have fellowship with us
[46:23] so he's there and he's closer than he
[46:25] was back then
[46:28] what is it then then it's us if we will
[46:31] have fellowship with him he desires us
[46:33] to have Fellowship
[46:36] you know his brother Bosworth told
[46:37] brother Brandon said well you know what
[46:39] is fellowship it's Two Fellas in one
[46:41] ship
[46:43] well he's on the ship with you and
[46:45] everything else is going wrong then you
[46:46] know what he wants you to have
[46:47] fellowship with him and tell him Lord I
[46:49] can't get through this do you see what's
[46:51] going on
[46:53] but you know he wasn't worried about
[46:55] what was going on
[46:58] because in the midst of that storm he
[47:00] just got up out of that out of that
[47:02] little room off the bed
[47:07] and you know what and here's this great
[47:09] massive storm and no you know the boats
[47:12] pitching every different direction
[47:15] but you know he just walked calmly
[47:18] to the front of that boat
[47:21] and of all that pitching and everything
[47:23] going on he just kept going walked right
[47:25] up there
[47:28] and put his foot on the front of that
[47:30] boat
[47:31] and said peace be still
[47:34] that's all he said
[47:36] he didn't you know he didn't get down
[47:38] and pray and he didn't he wasn't in all
[47:41] this kind of thing you know he just
[47:42] spoke to the storm
[47:44] and it's and it ceased
[47:46] yeah
[47:47] in the midst of all that you know then
[47:49] he he turned to the disciples and told
[47:51] him he said now listen he said and in
[47:53] the midst of all this and you've seen
[47:55] all because here he is he's trying to
[47:58] get them to understand they've seen all
[48:00] the Miracles that that has taken place
[48:02] all the you know the Dead's been raised
[48:04] the the feeling of all you know the you
[48:07] know the thousands or whatever all the
[48:09] Miracles that's taking place he knows
[48:11] the secrets of people's hearts all the
[48:12] things that Jesus has done and he's
[48:14] speaking to them and you know all the
[48:16] things that they've seen up to them and
[48:18] it's like
[48:20] why are you so fearful
[48:22] and you have no faith
[48:26] because you've come all this way and
[48:28] you've seen all these things
[48:31] but you identify me as the one that was
[48:34] back there with Moses
[48:37] it's like Peter your your dad Peter and
[48:40] and Andrew y'all's dad was talking about
[48:43] uh the great Jehovah of the Old
[48:46] Testament and you know you you've heard
[48:48] the the Scrolls read in the prophets and
[48:51] and all those things that you've you've
[48:53] read all the all your life and you've
[48:54] heard all the Miracles that God done
[48:58] and you identify me as that
[49:03] and and so
[49:04] here I am in
[49:07] in flesh
[49:10] I'm the one that's in flesh that was
[49:12] spoken of back there
[49:14] because that's who you identify me as
[49:17] the Messiah
[49:18] the word made flesh
[49:20] that you that well you said you said you
[49:22] believe what Isaiah said Jeremiah Moses
[49:25] Joshua David
[49:28] well if I'm the Fulfillment of that I'm
[49:30] standing in your midst why are you why
[49:31] are you not believing this
[49:33] oh man if I if I was down there around
[49:35] the walls of Jericho I would have just
[49:38] been marching knowing there was a great
[49:39] Victory coming
[49:43] well you know what there was a great
[49:44] victory in front of them they didn't
[49:45] they went up there rejoicing
[49:48] they didn't rejoice in the fact that
[49:49] they were about ready to look like that
[49:50] boat was about ready to go into in the
[49:52] sea
[49:55] well well you know what we we believe
[49:57] David that Daniel he was a man of God he
[50:00] was a prophet of God he had the word of
[50:02] God and you know what he went in that
[50:03] Lion's Den and he was there facing those
[50:06] hungry lands but you know what the angel
[50:08] of the Lord was there with him and you
[50:09] know what the Lord brought him out
[50:14] well if the Lord brought him out then
[50:16] why is it that the same God that was
[50:18] back there is the same God that stands
[50:20] before us and we don't have faith in
[50:22] what he believed and what he said we
[50:24] don't believe what he said
[50:26] it's just like well if that's the same
[50:28] that he's the same because the Bible
[50:30] says he's the same yesterday today and
[50:32] forever so if that was if that was true
[50:34] back there that it's true right here
[50:36] and here he is speaking to him he said
[50:38] why is it that y'all are so fearful and
[50:40] have no faith to believe because of the
[50:42] things you've seen the things that
[50:44] you've read
[50:46] if you begin to identify this ministry
[50:49] as the Fulfillment of the Old Testament
[50:52] of the law
[50:53] of the prophecies then how is it you
[50:56] can't believe what's taken place
[50:58] when it stands in your midst
[51:04] and if you can believe this
[51:06] it's like wow what manner of man is this
[51:11] that even the winds and see obey him
[51:15] why because there's you know because
[51:16] when you know brother Ram says you know
[51:18] God wants us to believe for big things
[51:23] and you know sometimes when when you
[51:25] know when it's small things you know
[51:27] what what we got we got faith hey we can
[51:29] believe that
[51:33] but you know what when things get a
[51:35] little bit tougher and the things get a
[51:36] little bit bigger then you know what our
[51:38] faith is being tried with sometimes our
[51:40] faith begins to waver on on the bigger
[51:43] things
[51:44] and when it becomes even bigger trials
[51:46] then we have we have well you know I I
[51:48] want to believe
[51:51] but it's harder to believe
[51:56] because you know but God wants us to
[51:57] believe in the big things he wants to
[51:59] ask for the big things he wants to ask
[52:01] for great things
[52:04] it's like well I don't I don't I don't
[52:06] know no God wants you to try him
[52:12] because you know what he tries you
[52:15] he brings things along your path and he
[52:17] wants to see if you believe him what
[52:19] you're going to do
[52:22] is that is that what he said about
[52:23] coming up the stature
[52:27] you're coming up to certain things in
[52:28] your life and you know he's going to try
[52:29] you see where you stand
[52:32] why because that's that's how you that's
[52:34] how you grow as child rearing bringing
[52:36] you up
[52:39] well do you have confidence in what God
[52:41] will do
[52:44] it's like well I don't I don't I don't
[52:46] see I don't see a way out
[52:49] well praise God you ain't you ain't
[52:50] found the Waymaker
[52:53] here is the Waymaker
[52:55] he's like well if we could just come to
[52:57] a place to realize that he's here
[53:00] and he wants to make a way for you
[53:03] he wants to show you there's a way out
[53:07] there's a way of Deliverance whatever
[53:09] you ask for he's there to meet your need
[53:14] now the problem is is sometimes when we
[53:16] get to that place where you say well you
[53:19] know we want God to do it the way we
[53:20] want it done and we want it done when we
[53:23] want it done
[53:27] and the problem is is God's not going to
[53:29] do that
[53:30] God's going to do it his own time
[53:33] and praise God you know there's been
[53:35] times in my life you know I'm glad that
[53:37] God didn't answer my prayers
[53:40] because you know what I found out you
[53:41] know what I had I had it all
[53:43] miscalculated
[53:45] because God knew more about it than I
[53:47] did
[53:48] and he's like well Lord I'm just going
[53:50] I'm just going to trust you because I
[53:52] realize that that I'm inadequate in this
[53:54] situation
[53:57] but you know he's got it all in control
[54:02] brother Ryan says I wonder today brother
[54:04] he said if we're failing to recognize
[54:06] yet Among Us the Holy Spirit
[54:10] he said I wonder if the people in our
[54:13] attitude today if we don't fail to
[54:14] recognize that this is the Holy Spirit
[54:18] that the holy spirit is Among Us
[54:22] President says if we can only realize
[54:25] that he is here with us the same
[54:27] yesterday today and forever he said lo I
[54:30] Am With You Always I'll never leave you
[54:31] I'll never forsake you I'm with you to
[54:34] the end of the world
[54:35] is that 24th chapter
[54:38] he said I'll never leave you again he
[54:40] said oh again I will never leave you nor
[54:42] forsake you I am I was just looking at
[54:45] the scripture I had wrote down here
[54:47] concerning it he said how can we be sure
[54:50] by his proven word
[54:52] he is now waiting for you to call him on
[54:54] the scene to be proved
[54:57] so let us go and wake Jesus on our lives
[55:01] he said how do you awake Christ by
[55:03] believing his word faith brings him on
[55:05] the scene that's what brings him on the
[55:08] same faith
[55:09] then call him
[55:10] and call on him to confirm his word and
[55:12] don't doubt in fear
[55:14] don't do that just believe him as as it
[55:17] is written and let it be done and God
[55:19] will prove to you that Jesus Christ is
[55:21] the same yesterday today and forever he
[55:23] said we worship an invisible God
[55:27] amen if we can believe what God has said
[55:31] he's here
[55:34] and all that he said
[55:36] is yours
[55:38] he said it's the father's good pleasure
[55:40] to give you the kingdom
[55:42] whatever you exit he said he would not
[55:44] withhold any good thing
[55:47] to those that walk uprightly
[55:50] and you know and you say well brother
[55:52] Aaron I got this problem I got that
[55:54] problem well guess what
[55:56] God's made a way he has a provision for
[55:59] you to come back into Divine Fellowship
[56:02] if you're not in fellowship with God
[56:04] then we know who's out of position
[56:09] but you know what he's made a way and
[56:11] he's here
[56:12] for you to call on him and say Lord I
[56:15] want to come back in Fellowship Lord I
[56:17] don't want to be cold in the spirit
[56:20] Lord I don't want I don't want to be
[56:21] bound by these same things
[56:24] there are certain situations in my life
[56:26] that I can't Advance Beyond this point
[56:29] and Lord I'm just like the disciples on
[56:31] that ship getting kicked around
[56:34] and I can't stay where I'm at
[56:37] I have no control over this situation
[56:42] but you know what he's on the scene for
[56:44] you to call on and if you will call on
[56:47] him he'll come on the scene
[56:50] and he will whatever has to be done they
[56:53] say Lord I'm just going to turn it over
[56:54] to you
[56:55] then you know what he's on the scene to
[56:57] work miracles to change lives to deliver
[57:00] to fill what the Holy Spirit whatever
[57:03] you have need of healing in your body
[57:08] there ain't no there ain't no big things
[57:10] in little things in God it's all the
[57:12] same
[57:15] why because when he when he died and he
[57:17] made a provision he covered all sin he
[57:20] healed all sicknesses he healed all
[57:22] diseases
[57:25] wow well he took when he took the the
[57:27] keys from Satan and he took over the
[57:30] whole Kingdom then you know what there's
[57:31] not a single one of them down there
[57:33] that's got any kind of power that that
[57:34] because it's permitted of God
[57:38] allows them
[57:41] and so you know what there's nothing out
[57:43] of cater with God
[57:46] and if you and I
[57:48] can just put our trust in him
[57:52] and as Jesus said
[57:54] let us pass over
[57:56] and go to the other side
[57:58] because that's our desire to get out of
[58:00] here because there's a better land
[58:01] waiting than where we're at tonight
[58:05] and that's my desire
[58:06] well God bless you let's all stand we'll
[58:08] have the musicians come
[58:20] on

[58:34] he led him through the Red Sea
