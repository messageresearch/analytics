========================================

get it started heavenly father it's just a joy to be able to participate in this kind of occasion see these these five new converse to this word hearing the word catching their attention a new attitude and you desire a new a new heart i'll give you i want to uh we always read the scripture here and it's always one fitting and it's a sermon in itself but we're not going to keep you long but we need we do need to realize while we're here we're not here just to get someone wet or to give them a new position in life no life tomorrow is going to be just as hard as life was yesterday right but it's made a little bit easier by being dead in christ and not being alive to the world that's what we're doing here today let's look in romans chapter six we see paul and what he says is what shall we say then he's asking a question shall we continue in sin that grace may abound question god forbid all right what shall we say then shall we continue in sin and grace may abound god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein for the old man's death know you not that so many of us if we're baptized into jesus christ we're baptized into his death that's what we're going to do today we're going down we're going to be buried and we're going to come back up in newness of life therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life for we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead he's free from sin many times we've made this this statement but my grandfather on my dad's side died in 1945. now you couldn't convict that man of robbing a bank yesterday why he's dead that man does not live anymore so you can't accuse the dead man of anything right that's what we're doing today going down live coming back the old man he's gonna wash away and bring the new man up you and don't don't know the scriptural baptism we're gonna read it right here sure this is not what jesus said well we're gonna read you what jesus said acts 2. paul and peter preaching a sermon about jesus christ listen verse 37 now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart what brother tom was saying they weren't pricked in their spirit or their body they were pricked in their heart down in the very very soul of man and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do that was your question that was your question what shall we do then peter said unto them the very first thing we should do is repent you're not repented you'll just go down a wet center or dry center and come up away all right but repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and listen to this promise and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise what promise the prophecy getting hold of right isn't to you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call and on that day there were three thousand souls added just because of one man's sermon now you say why don't we baptize in the name of the father and of the son of the holy ghost well my name is samuel wade dale i'm a father i'm a son and i'm a human being but i don't sign my checks father i don't sign my check son even though i am the son of samuel doubt but what identifies me is my name right my name is what i'm identified with so jesus was saying he was saying go into all the world preach the gospel baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost well what is the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost lord jesus christ jesus said in all words indeed do what do in the name of jesus christ not the name of the father you scream father all day and you don't know what it is but if you call someone's name that identifies who they are so peter given the keys to the kingdom he wasn't uh like uh brother tom was saying sure he had his problems in his in his uh part of life when jesus was there but when when that same god came into the heart of peter when i'm saying jesus came into the heart of peter he said peter when you're converted strengthen the brethren so the first thing he did was they had pentecost jesus told him said peter said whatever you bind on earth i'll find it in heaven whatever you loose on earth i'll loose in heaven so who better person that had a key than peter on the day of pentecost it wasn't any other it was peter would god give him the key he said whatever you find on earth i'll bind in heaven whatever you loose on earth i'll loose in heaven he said but to fulfill all righteousness you gotta baptize me all right that's what we gotta do oh let this be a possession if the devil comes to you you take him back to this moment right here he said look the old dave howard was dead i don't live no more right i'm dead take him back to this spot if you have to walk up here i don't care my brother won't mind if you could you come right here you said look this is where i died see i can take him back to the funeral home and i'm taking him back to the graveyard and i said that's what my grandfather was buried so that's where we buried him we're going to bury you today okay all right fulfill the great commission to baptize all new converts now that's converged in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost i now baptize my brother david houseman hallelujah in the name of the lord jesus christ amen i've been wanting to do this a long time in accordance to the scripture to baptize all new converts in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost i now baptize my brother joey knight hallelujah in the name of the lord jesus christ you know that old place that i was baptized they've about filled it in they are going to make a bridge and they tore down that tree i love that old tree because i never forget when i came out of the water brother didn't give it he said there's angels sitting in those tree limbs so there's angels sitting in those trees you know what whatever i find on earth i'll bind in heaven we just bound two men for the gospel of jesus christ now it's their job to walk in newness of life go back to the old man the old man's dead you're going to have problems you're going to have trials you're going to have tribulations you're going to have fears amen we're going to have trials and tribulations and fears but you know what put a stake down right say this is it right here that's right this is the day the old man died anyone else before i get out of this warm water feels good it's nice well it's 19 degrees when we went through the game all about froze and bud gotta die before sidewalk went down that water was so cold it took my breath so bad so i did not know anything until i got coming out of the water when she came out of the water i remember when they walked her back up from lakeland air there was ice sickles hanging off of her hair wow that's how cold it was it was 19 degrees and the air temperature was probably colder than that probably not seen below chill fashion every fountain in gainesville was iced over but you know what he didn't see that and stop she knew and i was baptized it was 30 degrees in that water down there in the river and it's as warm as it is right now
