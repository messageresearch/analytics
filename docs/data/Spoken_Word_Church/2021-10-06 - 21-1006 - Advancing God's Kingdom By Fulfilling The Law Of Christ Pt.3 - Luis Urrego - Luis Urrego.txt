heads before we go to the lord in prayer our heavenly father we thank you lord once again for the opportunity to serve you lord in this late hour that we live in lord we realize lord jesus that without you lord god we are nothing father lord without you father god where would be where would we be we be lord oh father god we could be lord in a hospital we could be father god even even have left the scene right now lord god but lord jesus you still kept us father god we're still here because father we have a work to do and we have for something that we must fulfill father and lord jesus we thank you father we lord we just commit ourselves and this time into your hands may you just continue to be with those that can't be here for whatever reason those that are sick lord god we pray

jesus when it's your word father god laying aside our all of our opinions and all of our own thinking lord god and just let your word speak father god lord we just commit this time now into your hands in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen praise the lord jesus if you turn with me to john chapter 15 john chapter 15 we're going to start at verse verse eight series yeah verse eight herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so so shall ye be my disciples as the father hath loved me so have i loved you continue ye in my love now we know that he was talking to his disciples here but it wasn't just a word for his disciples amen it's a word for each and every one of us if ye keep my commandments ye shall abide in my love amen it's the only way that you can keep his commandments is by his love and his love is comes through it comes by the holy ghost even as i have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love these things have i spoken unto you that my joy that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full amen verse 14 here this is my commandment that ye love one another as i have loved you now see he says this this is my commandment this is my commandment that ye love one another as i have loved you greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends in other words sacrifice yourself for your friends you are my friends jesus says if you do whatsoever i command you in other words if you obey him you're his friend if you if you don't you're not his friend these things i command you verse 17 these things i command you i command you that you love one another amen and then the last verse in galatians chapter 6 verse 2 says bear ye one another's burdens and so in so doing this and bearing one another's burdens you fulfill this law of christ that jesus is talking about here my commandment his commandment you fulfill that law you may be seated this afternoon this evening praise the lord jesus amen so um if the brothers can bring the the first picture up um and you can blow it up that'd be great so you all pray for us this this this sunday is brother wade he'll be out and he'll be ministering we'll be in orlando florida preaching as well ministering to to a group there a little group from el salvador and uh it's their meeting there and so they asked us if we could if we could visit them so we're gonna do that so you just pray for us and um also uh pray for us as well on november the sixth and the seventh we'll be ministering in jacksonville florida as well and then lord willing on november the 30th we'll be heading to central america for a seven week mission trip so it'll be about what month and a half something like that almost two months so i wanted to uh to kind of show you all we'll be leaving november 30th and it probably won't be back till like january the 18th so you all remember us in prayer i'm just trusting that everything goes well before and now and then there's so many changes going on in this world you just don't know what's going to happen between now and then but uh that's the plan well we already have our tickets to leave out november the 30th and we'll be heading to honduras first so this is uh the area where we're going to be going out so that you'd know um up here that up at the top right hand corner is florida and mexico so central america is right here um i know some people don't don't know where central america is and so this will kind of give you a little bit as to where there's the united states right there central america is right there and that's my home country right down there in south america so this strip right here central america will be in honduras nicaragua and costa rica lord willing next next slide so there's um we'll be uh this is what we'll be landing in honduras in san pedro sula and um we'll be in honduras mostly in this area right here and so where i have the little squiggly lines in those areas right there there's a lot of uh we're going to be up in the mountains a lot in those areas so there's there's a lot of there's different brothers that um that have um that go to these different areas uh and they do mission work and they work with the people there and of course they they need they need help you know any help that you can give them you know is is it's wonderful so i've i've been asked personally by a brother for two years to come and visit him from that area and to get to his church you have to walk like five hours up in the mountains nobody visits them but he's he's got a church over there and so so he told me two years ago because him and his family uh walked to a a youth camp that we were at for about two hours and so they they um he said yeah brother we'll be more than glad to have you we would love to if you come visit us we don't have anybody to visit us so you see the brothers that come from the states they'll go they go down there and they visit the the known churches and the churches in the cities but these brothers up in the mountains they never get visited harley so that is my purpose for this trip to go out and visit these little places you know that don't get visited hardly at all they need to be you know they need some encouragement from from here too so um so lord willing we'll be doing that and um and after that we'll be here around uh pretty much the month of december and then coming down here this is nicaragua now and then from here um lord willing we'll be we'll be traveling all the way to the east coast of nicaragua this is a 12-hour trip right here and this in this area right here it's it's a group called the mosquitos not mosquitoes but the mosquitos they they have their own dialect they it's like a it's like a fusion between spanish and something else so when you preach there you actually need an interpreter and there's an interpreter there's a brother interpreter over there so we'll be traveling with some of these brothers back to that area and probably be there maybe for for maybe a week and a half or two and uh now you all just just pray for me because some of these places where i'm going to be going to this time around the really rugged areas and really uh bad areas and it's actually areas that even my wife is not going to be able to go to actually the brothers they recommended that don't bring your your wife don't bring your daughters because it's gonna be pretty rough terrain so so you all just pray for us amen that there'll be no snakes or anything like that but um uh so from there lord willing we'll be heading back back to to this area right here and then and then we'll be traveling down to finish their trip off in january in costa rica in san jose costa rica up in that area and we'll probably be there for about a week a week and a half and then from there we travel back so you all just pray for us because that's all that all can change but um but that is the plan for now that is the plan for now um next slide now i show these picture and the little little boy there he's a he's naked of course and uh he has no clothes i tried to cover up what i could but uh this is some of the areas where i'm i don't i don't know if i'm going to get to visit uh this time around these areas but some of these some of these places as you can see these these kids they don't even have clothes to wear um next slide and you can you can kind of tell you know they got their little bulging bellies you know the little the little bellies that they're hungry they don't have they don't have a lot to eat some of them have some clothes some of them don't this brother right here this is brother eli he's a he works he's a missionary there in the in in honduras and he works in those areas a lot and he says brother these people are just the poor of the poor they're so poor that that these brothers they give those families in those areas clothes for them to wear and they they end up just selling the clothes so that they can buy food and that's one of the reasons why they they don't they they can't you know their children walk around some of them walk around nude next next slide this brother right here these pictures were just sent to me recently this is the same location this brother right here is getting ready to be married to the sister right here and if you if you could tell you know the p if there was more detail but you could see his shoes i mean they're they're just tattered um but they they already got married by this you know by the by the by the country but civil a civil wedding so next month they're going to have a an actual wedding at the little church but of course they don't have any he doesn't have any money to buy himself a uh something to wear she doesn't have anything to wear for the for the wedding gown so some of us brothers we pitched in to kind of help them buy some something so that they can have their little wedding i just sent that money last week to them and some other brothers from the from the country also helped out and also for them to be able to have a little a little you know get together afterwards a little thing food for the people but this sister right here if you can if you can go to the next slide that's the same sister right here you can see she's barefooted they tell me the brother tells me that every time they go visit her she's always wearing the same clothes and so the brother is telling he's like well last time we were here we brought you clothes what what happened he said i had to sell them i had to sell them because i need to feed my family i need to feed so um so you all just remember see remember those those families in prayer and yet they're still trying to be faithful going to church you know uh next slide that is that is i believe this is the the little church right here in the area and then this is the pastors or the the the pastor's house and uh that's where he lives right there and uh it's high it's because they're near the ocean so it floods a lot in those areas but they tell me it's just a very very poor area so next slide all right so that was honduras that was in honduras this right here is nicaragua now um last year i don't know if some of you brothers i had asked for some help for for this church right here because they had just bought a piece of land to build because this little area right here where they were congregating at uh it's the people are growing and they have no more space now so uh next slide this is the little area this is the little area where they're holding the services i've preached there before and uh just wonderful people the place is called monte tabor nicaragua next slide and it's up up on a kind of up on a hill so what they did is they they just built a little space right there so they can meet right next to someone's home and that's why you see it's kind of it's almost like a little garage type of thing next that's then meeting next slide and uh yeah that's best from looking from behind from the back of the church next slide next next all right so here this is uh so by the grace of god last year we were able to help them out with the down payment to buy the uh the the the piece of land the the piece of land cost them eight thousand dollars and so we were able to help them buy the uh the land we i think we gave them like 1200 or something like that for the down payment 1500 something like that they got it down now to about uh 5 000 now that they need to pay off so um the brothers are just asking they have not built a church there yet because what they want to do is they is they want to finish paying this loan off so that they can continue you so that they can start building the church and uh so they don't look bad to the people that they bought the land from they have a certain uh determinate amount of time so you all just pray for for for these brothers that uh they'd be able to pay it off uh sooner i think i think i can't remember the time frame that they gave them but they have about five thousand dollars that they need left to pay off so if you feel in your heart that you want to help out with that they would certainly appreciate that next slide this is them um in that same area next slide all right and this this is part of the group there this is brother allen and he's also he's a missionary there in nicaragua he goes all over nicaragua but he's the one who is helping built this group up there in nicaragua he's kind of spearheading this work over there so he's he's the one who's asking prayer for for for the little for this group their next slide and then this is more or the more of them i is that it okay so now yeah so now what they've done is they've they've built just for space sake they've built just a little temporary little hut type thing on that in the area where they where they where they purchased the property and so they can meet and they'd be able to have more space instead of being cramped up in that little other area next slide then this that's them right there but eventually they want to build their own church in that in that spot so you all just i think that's the last slide so y'all just remember that in prayer that is one of the places that i i want to go visit when we go over there and just kind of take pictures of the area and just report back and some of you all helped out with that with that with that church there and remember us in your prayers amen my desire is to just be able to help amen amen and uh in whatever way we can we can't we can't do anything i mean we can't do everything right you know but what little we can do amen and and we we will be more than willing to do and you know my wife and i we we i thank god that god gave me a wife who who loves to go on trips like that with me and that's been my desire you know to just just be on the mission field and it just breaks my heart just see these little kids like that you know and just and you wish you could just do something for them right there and then but the best thing you can do is we pray for them amen pray for them and uh and send who you if you can't go brother i'm saying to send somebody man if you can't go you just send somebody so so we just thank god for that so you all remember us in your prayers in the next coming weeks as we'll be prepping for that lord willing amen so let's go and let's look at this here and i promise i'm not going to keep you all along tonight so we're going to move here a little quick so if you remember in the last two services last two parts when we were talking about this um we were talk we were bringing it out of john chapter 13. i'm trying to shift my mind here now from mission missions now to the word and uh we were preaching out of john chapter 13 and we were we were looking at john chapter 13 and if you remember how what jesus was this was just a few nights it was real right before he was betrayed and right before he he uh he went to the garden of gethsemane and went on the cross and he was there with the disciples and we all know we all read the story we know what the story is and we see how the how judas was there and how satan had entered him and and and and he did and what he did was and jesus didn't didn't argue with him he just said you know i know what you're going to do so you just go ahead and do it and sometimes you know uh you don't have to argue with anybody you know just let them do what they need to do amen uh they're gonna go one way just let them go i think the best way that we can that people learn their lessons better is to just let them make their own mistakes let them learn their own mistakes and they realize then okay what am i doing you know now it just depends on what it is but most of the times you know that's that's at least that's how i was i make my own mistakes then i learned my own lessons you know then they stay they stay but if you try to push somebody won't you do this do this and that and they don't want to do it you're not going to get them to do anything just let them make their own mistakes let them have their own experience and that'll that'll teach them more let god teach them not necessarily you teach them let god teach them of course you know we as parents and we as uh as leaders you know we try to do and direct as much as we can but ultimately it's that person's choice i hope to you can take your children up to a certain point after that it's got to be god to do it then amen it's got to be if when god does it amen he does it good when we try to do it it never gets done or it gets done halfway and most of the time it's it just doesn't get done but when he does it he does it perfect amen and i don't know why i want to say that but uh that's that wasn't even in my notes it's just like brother wade by the way you was preaching sunday all kinds of things that we were talking as a family all last week and so you're you're you're saying somebody must needed this i see that's god that's the holy spirit just confirming those things even the night before we were having a little devotion at the house and brother wade was bringing things out sunday morning or sunday afternoon i believe it was exactly what we had talked about the night before i hadn't talked to brother wade i hadn't you know it was just that's that's god that's the god that we serve amen he comes to confirm his word and he does it in supernatural ways and when he does it those ways those ways stick but when it's planned and it's pushed and it's shoved you know it never sticks it never sticks amen praise god so we were looking there in john chapter 13 and uh we got to a point where jesus told uh judas hey just go go ahead and do what you need to do of course judas he left and went out the door and we talked about that a little bit in regards to uh how in the last days and the days that we're living in now the love of many shall wax cold if you remember that and we're seeing that now more than ever amen we're seeing how the love of people are as wax and cold amen and the the the situations that are taking place politically and in in the world amen it's causing people because they look at those things more than they look at the word it's causing the love of people to fall you know some of us we don't like to hear that but that's exactly what's happening because we look to the news we look to the media we look to the to the government so much amen it's causing us amen to real to forget where we come from our position amen and our position is not of this world we live in this world but we're not of this world so we don't need to act like the world amen praise god so so the love of because iniquity is abounding the love of many shall wax cold the bible says now we talked we we talked about how it the love wouldn't go away completely but it would wax cold it would get it would dwindle amen if we're not careful if we let the things of this life if we if we if we neglect this word amen we will allow that love amen for each other the love for god the love for his word the love for coming the church amen it will dwindle more and more and more if we're not careful praise god and and any and then and in talking about that i wanted to read a quote real quick where brother branham something interesting that i found uh or brother branham talks about in the third and church age if the brothers could bring this up it's the first quote i think that i put yes he says here i want to give you a warning right here it says concerning the last days that because of abounding iniquity the love of many will wax cold in the layer to sin or last age self love and love for material things will take the place of the true love of god amazon wouldn't have done good back in the 19 early 1900s amazon does good now ebay does good now it wouldn't be good back then in the early 1900s because the materialistic mindset of people you see so that's it it works hand in hand the in the other cn our last stage self love and love for material things will take the place of the true love of god we need to guard against the power of sin in these last days so many are getting so hard look what he says here so many are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effect of this last day spirit all right i'll read that again so many are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effect of this last day spirit and he says it is time to draw nigh to god and let him fill our lives with his love amen or we will or we will feel the coldness of the last day church and watch and reject the truth of god which alone is able to help us amen how do you think somebody that leaves the the word of god who who who decides i don't want to serve god anymore or who stop or or or leaves the message amen how does it start somewhere or another they leave the word of god some they start getting cold on god and eventually they will produce and you will see them i mean you just look go through their facebook posts they started out like this and then they end up this way it's a totally different thing wise because they let down their guard somewhere amen they let down the garden they felt that coldness of the last day church they rejected the truth somewhere or another amen you see in order for you to to uh in order for you to go and do your own thing and i'm speaking to everybody here but in order for you to go and do your own thing you have to overstep the word of god somewhere or another that's right you see yeah i i i if i if i if i'm gonna let's just say this is the word of god you know if i need to get to brother wade amen that's my idea i need to get to brother wade i've got to get around this this word somewhere or another to get to him right amen you see right and that's what people are doing in this hour that's right amen they're just overstepping the boundaries of the word they're overstepping what god has already laid out for them so that they could be happy so that they could have joy in their life so that they could have the peace of god so that they can live peaceably with man in order to fulfill their own lust their own desires and then they realize amen what am i doing here and you just have to look at their facebook posts and you realize what's going on people just tell on themselves just look at facebook well then maybe you shouldn't because then you'll be there doing this yeah and then you realize what am i doing has that ever happened to me [Laughter] or it just happens to me yeah but yeah yeah i mean you're there looking at people with what they ate for breakfast and all that stuff what do i care yeah all right so it's very this last day spirit is very very very very easy to get into there is nothing wrong with you having the business doing what you need to do working you've got to you've got to do what you got to do go to school have friends uh have a hobby do all those things and i'm talking to our young people amen do what you got to do but don't let those things ever take take over the word of god in your life don't ever let that take over the word of god or the holy spirit in your heart amen because this thing's about to end saints that's is this thing's about to finish up and we're just seeing the last few things last few things of it in this hour so we talked about last time in regards to how close judas judas was with the disciples that that jesus said the one that that that soaks the sop or the piece of bread you know he'd be the one and judas did it and the disciples still didn't realize that that was him you see and and we've lived in this hour in the last several years we've lived and we've seen amen the the how people have left this word and we thought we would never see them leave this world but we have a so close we would go to their meetings we'd we'd jump and shout sing with them and everything even eat with them and fellowship with them have them ask us questions and you talk with them and and all of a sudden hmm it's hard for us to see they're so close to each other it's like the tear the tear and the and the wheat they look alike amen they look alike but there are there's differences there amen there's differences amen the holy spirit will be able to spot those differences but if you don't have the holy spirit amen you'll just go right on with it amen you'll go right on with that because of the popularity because of of the of the status of the person and then you'll be you'll be you'll be uh uh you'll be deceived right just like just like the persons amen so so now let's look at ju john chapter 13. that was just a short and you can go back and listen to the last two services on this you get to get more details but if we look at john chapter 13 and uh we we stopped at verse 20 verse 30 i believe it was and uh where he says where judah says he then uh where judah where it says he then having received the sop went immediately out and it was night amen so when jesus pointed it out amen judas didn't like it and he stepped out and that's what they do amen when you point the with the truth and the word to people amen and they don't like it you realize amen their shift their their face changed and their attitude changes and their amen that that's that's one key thing and judas did what he was going to do and the bible says that it was night amen it was it's in this evening time amen they were seeing this and this late hour that we're living in is where we're seeing all these people amen that are just leaving the word amen and just uh you know they have found something better amen i don't know what's better than the word when than the revealed word i just i don't know what's better than that amen verse 31 now jesus wanted him to go amen i mean he was going to do that anyways he's the son of perdition but now we're getting ready to see here what what jesus is about to to to show them amen after judas steps out because he needed to step out in order for him to be able to speak more clearly to his disciples amen and in verse 31 he says therefore when he was gone out now see the bible makes it a point to even say that when therefore when he judas was gone out jesus said now now is the son of man glorified and god is glorified in him amen amen it's interesting that jesus says that right there because even in in him knowing what was getting ready to happen to him he was already making the situation as as if uh uh he wasn't uh he wasn't being stressed out by the situation you see he was looking at the situation as like this is an opportunity for the word of god to continue to be fulfilled i'm getting ready to be glorified i'm getting ready to fulfill everything that that that i was sent here to to fulfill amen praise god it almost reminds me of when on like on the day of pentecost amen what peter uh said this is that amen this is that that was spoken of amen so it's like jesus amen he said now amen now is or or or like when when if you remember the the vision that brother branham had when uh he went to go heal that that one girl and everything had to be in in in in in order there were there needed to be a lady sitting on that chair and cleaning her glasses this needed to be in place this needed to be in place amen that's the exact same thing that needed to be right here and this in this scene that we're looking at amen judas needed to leave so that now amen now is the son of man glorified and god is glorified in him verse 32 if god be glorified in him god shall also glorify him in himself and shall straightway glorify him amen are you glorified amen amen he's justified he has now glorified amen the bible says praise god are you is it just a separate glorification amen is the same glory if you got his holy spirit amen you're glorified in heavenly place you're sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus tonight it's hard to believe oh man i'm tired been driving that chicken truck all day long [Laughter] well ryan maybe he's got to drive it tonight oh man i've been hey man it doesn't seem like we're we're glorified amen but we are because the bible says so amen we don't feel it on the outside but the bible says that we are now in sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus now see now because jesus said there in verse 31 now is the son of man glorified and in reality it really what it hadn't not really taken place yet because it needed he needed to still die he needed to resurrect but he was already talking about the now and so we need to look at ourselves now even though we see this chaos even if we see the judas's leaving the message even if we see everything going on now are we sitting in heavenly places you are now special people not that you will be not that you were amen you are now i like brother dale brother dale loves the present the present god the now god amen we serve the now god amen praise the lord jesus it's good to serve the god of the future yeah we know that there's promises in the word for the future amen but that's for the future amen amen it was good to see the promises that god fulfilled in the past but that was the past i want to know what god's doing now what is god doing now in your life amen verse 32 if god be glorified in him god shall also glorify him in himself and shall straightway glorify him this is jesus still speaking verse 33 he says little children yet a little while i am with you so he's telling him i'm going to be with you for just a little bit more and you shall seek me you're going to you're going to seek me and as i said unto the jews whether i go where i go you cannot come but watch he says here so now i say to you so now i say to you he couldn't say this while judas was still there there's certain things that god is doing now in our lives and this word is just opening up more and more to us amen but you know what some of the things that have happened in the last several years have had to happen in order for us to come to the place where we are now i believe that amen and and and don't be surprised that there's more surprises i hope not but you stay with the word you stay where you need to with what you have believed amen don't worry about who who who else isn't believing or who seems like they're they're doubting amen you worry about yourself where if you're doubting the word am i doubting the word amen i go you cannot come so now i say to you watch what he says here in verse 34 a new commandment i give unto you a new commandment see because we talked about they had their commandments but uh at the even in their own commandments the first two commandments pointed to loving god amen and to love thy neighbor as thyself amen in other words pointing them back to love amen a new commandment i give unto you that ye love one another as i have loved you that ye also love one another now watch in verse 35 he says by this by what by loving one another by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love one to another amen now the love the the word love here that that we're talking about is the word agape this is when you look back at this word it's the word agape amen now how are we going to demonstrate to the world that we love one another i i mean that we are his disciples by loving one another right now you may ask the question how do i love my brother how can i love my brother how can i love my sister amen because it's it's usually the ones of the same family that get on each other's nerves most of the time amen some of us who see each other more and more often is ones that we get on each other's nerves more and more often if we're not careful if we allow it amen but we're supposed to amen those things happen to help mature us amen in the love of christ praise the lord jesus amen so how do i love my brother amen we're going to turn here in just a moment to romans chapter 12 amen we're going to read a few verses there but here are some things amen how do i love my brother i mean one of the things that you love your brother is be willing to forgive be willing to forgive amen that is something very easy to say but it's so hard to do be willing to forgive amen and and not just loving your brother because it's easy to love those that love you back amen amen amen because if you can love your brother amen if you practice loving for your brother amen then then it's it's not a problem amen you loving anybody else amen praise god it's being able to get along with those in the same family amen that that sometimes is the toughest amen because we just know each other so good and we just rub shoulders all the time amen we just don't amen that's when we need to make sure that we love because sometimes that gives us a it gives us an easy avenue amen to just say whatever comes to mind and disrespect one another and say things amen to each other and and about others amen that just is disrespectful and it in in it it hurts the body of christ and whole right amen i'm just being true i'm just being honest i'm just telling you that that's how it is but be willing to forgive amen and how many times did jesus say to forgive eight times ten times seven times no he said seventy times seven but that is not whatever 70 times 7 is by the way 490 yes for one thing that's not just 490 times and that's it oh you're at your 489th time you better not do it again i'm not going to forgive you after the 490th time that's not what jesus was talking about he was talking about unlimited forgiveness because why you want god to unlimitedly forgive you too so why can't you do that for your brother or your sister we always go to god lord jesus what is the first thing that we should at least be praying for is lord forgive me if there's anything i've done forgive us forgive me amen amen paul had to repent even for things and and the type of man that he was and the life that he lived he still repented brother branham the type of man that he was and the life that he lived he still repented we all have to repent so if we want god to forgive us amen we must also be willing to forgive every moment every time every single moment it happens and be patient with one another and loving to one another amen so be willing to forgive that's one way to show love to your brother because let me tell you your brother and your sister will fail you if they haven't already they will fail you that's just how it is amen they will fail you but can you forgive them lift them back up lift them back up with forgiveness sacrifice yourself for your brother or your sister amen amen are you willing to lay down your life for them jesus said you are my friends in john 15 we just read here you are my friends and friends will be willing to lay down their life for one another let's just sink that in for a moment are we willing to do that hey listen and when i'm i'm i'm talking to myself as well all right can you give your life and that's that's that's not just saying hey man somebody comes in here and shoots amen and i take a bullet for brother wade yeah because that's the that's the thought that at least it comes to my head you know [Laughter] take two but it's not just that but if if if you can't even sacrifice even a little thing amen sacrifice some time for your brother or your sister how are you going to take a bullet for your brother or your sister if you can't sacrifice some time for them if you can't if you if you if you can't if you're not willing to listen to them how are you going to be able to take a bullet for your brother or your sister think about that so that is one way to love your brother are you willing to sacrifice yourself or your brother lay down your life for your brother your sister another way is to how is is have unselfish compassion for your brother or your sister amen praise god amen we we see where cain he lost his compassion for his brother abel and you know why he lost his compassion his love for his brother because his his brother's works were were better than his and guess what happened instead of him seeing where can i where did i make a instead of him going to abel abel uh where is it that i'm missing it you know what you know humbling himself you know he takes a stone and kills him hurts his brother and what is what does that show it shows his jealousy it was jealousy that caused that drove cain to do what he did to kill his brother so have unselfish compassion for one another amen amen amen again everything that i'm saying amen i'm saying it from the pulpit down to the to the to the end of the hallway there amen another thing is is to have an attitude of sharing amen be willing to share praise god be willing to give up what you prize most amen now i mean if you if i if you're if the bible says to give up your life for your brother that's we prize our life right so anything else that you can are willing to give up for your for your brother amen not just give it to them because you don't want it anyways like they're a good will or something isn't that what we do when we go to goodwill oh we feel so good because we're donating some clothes we're donating some some some toys or whatever but we don't want them anyways are you willing to share with those the even the most important things in your life amen including your time amen and another thing here is keeping unity with each other and amongst each other amen keeping the unity that's that's that's so important amen keeping unity don't let anything amen break that unity between each other because it breaks it'll break the your affection and the love that you have for your brother amen romans chapter 12 romans chapter 12. you love the lord amen romans chapter 12 we'll just read a few verses here and maybe say a couple of things here this is paul speaking here he says let love be without the simulation verse 9 let love be without the simulation now what is the simulation the simulation is hypocrisy so in other words let your love be without hypocrisy or let it not be a feigned love amen let your love be real amen abhor that which is evil that means hate that which is evil and cleave to that which is good and then grab on to that which is good number 10 be kindly affection one to another with brotherly love now remember we are talking about jesus's commandment right his commandment was to love one another my new commandment amen that's what he was saying be kindly affection one to another with brotherly love and honor preferring one another not slothful in business fervent in spirit serving the lord rejoicing in hope patient and tribulation continuing in instant instant in prayer distributing to the necessity of saints given to hospitality amen are you willing to open your home to be hospitable to to to amen that's that's part of hospitality amen that's where we get the word hospital amen when you go to the hospital you don't get treated at home but you know you're you say you're in the hospital no you're you're somewhere else outside of your home you're in a hospital amen bless them which persecute you bless and curse not now isn't this like the words that jesus was saying when he was given the beatitudes and this is what paul is saying amen and paul has the same spirit that jesus has amen bless them which persecute you persecute you bless and curse not rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep be of the same mind one toward another mind not high things but condescend to man of low estate be not wise in your own conceits now i want to read this in the in the the new living testament version i believe that's what it is nlt version look what it says it says live in harmony with each other don't be too proud to enjoy the company of ordinary people and don't think you know it all that's what paul was saying in plain language and don't think you know it all lord help me amen amen lord help me because you see cain would have reacted differently to abel you see but because he didn't want to acknowledge amen that abel did something better than him which is fine amen but how can i learn from my brother or my sister instead of me hating them amen and and any bad word that you could say about your brother or your sister amen that's just like throwing a stone at them it's killing their influence amen praise god so don't be too proud to enjoy the company of ordinary people and don't think you know it all amen because let me tell you i want to throw in this little story when back home in in south carolina where i grew up i grew up in greenville south carolina and in in the streets there roamed this lady she would walk back for years this lady who who her her nickname was hubba hubba that was her nickname and she she looked dirty she had a beard uh she would i mean she just didn't look like she smelled she and she would just walk all over the streets of berea near traveler's rest all over the streets everybody knew who hubba hubba was and people would and kids and and and teenagers and even adults would go by her and drive by her and say hey hubba hubba and she didn't like it and so she would throw rocks at people every time you'd see you'd see her she'd be she she's picking up throwing rocks at cars and things like that one time we we we left school and uh and here comes hubba hubba i mean we had to walk home from from school and it was about three or four of us and so of course we as kids i mean here oh hubba hubba yeah and your long beard and all this kind of stuff and she took a stick and started chasing us i mean she was literally chasing us lady was about i don't know at that time she was like 60 something years old but she was i mean she she was thin i mean she because she walked all the time carrying a big sack so i got older and that's i was working at papa john's this was back around 1999 to 2000 and i was there at the store one morning and i saw her go by and i said well i'm a little bit more mature now i was about 20 years old at the time 21 years old and i went outside i stopped what i was doing i said hey hey guys you take over let me go outside i wanted to talk to her so i went out there and i didn't know i didn't know i i didn't want to call her hubba hubba because i knew she'd get mad so i went out there and i started uh excuse me excuse me and she she looked at me and she had that you know she she looked mean you know she looked mean and i said well you know i just wanted to just talk to you and just kind of get to know you a little bit and and and that kind of you know when i'd said that that it changed her demeanor on her face because people wouldn't do that to her partly people would always just be mean to her but then when she's when she saw that somebody was literally legitimate wanted to get to know her i could see that her demeanor changed and so she was there kicking you know what she was talking to me she's like well you know my name my real name is frances and she started telling me about her life and how her her husband her husband was a in world war ii and he died in world war ii and it caused her to to to after that it caused her to live that way she just decided that her life wasn't worth living uh that you know the way normal life so she decided to live her life that way and i learned about her and i told i told miss francis you know and i was standing right there in front of her you know she you could she just didn't smell good or anything but just to listen to this person who actually had a soul who has a soul no matter how dirty she was on the outside she just wanted to be heard she just wanted to be somebody to pay attention to her amen and i i in and and by doing that amen and i said you know miss francis we're going to be praying for you we'll be praying for you at that time i started serving the lord again because after my rebellious stage in life and i'm and so and just making that decision amen i got to know somebody and to learn something from somebody that i would have never known if i would have just continued with what everybody else was doing you see so so i i say that to to accomplish this this verse where paul says amen don't be too proud to enjoy the company of ordinary people amen amen and don't think that you know it all amen because you you can learn from the even the the most quietest person in the in the church and you can learn from somebody take every moment and every opportunity and not just to thank young people not just to think i'm just going to hang out with the with the with the with the popular group i'm just going to hang out with the with the ones that are always you know no amen take time amen to just learn from everybody amen i just can't stand seeing somebody sitting in a corner amen and not being it not having fellowship that's just that's never been me you know i at least want to go say something to him you know so just if you we take time to do that amen that'll just help us and it'll help that person too amen jesus humility amen that we read about there in john 13 i mean he the god of heaven and earth he humbled himself to wash amen the disciples dirty feet amen and that is our example praise god let's continue reading in verse 17. we're almost done here recompense to no man evil for evil in other words don't pay back don't don't get even with people i mean somebody does something to you don't try to get even with them because that's not that's not god's spirit that's not christ spirit recompense to no man evil for evil provide things honest in the sight of all man and watch verse 18 if it be possible as much as lieth in you live peaceably with all man i know that's that's what paul says here if it be possible because sometimes that's not possible but don't let it come from you [Laughter] sometimes you know you just can't you can't deal with people so the best thing to do is just stay quiet just just leave them alone some people just don't budge you know you've done your part let god do the rest maybe i'm wrong in thinking that way but if you've just tried and tried and tried and tried to deal with people at some point i mean god doesn't stops dealing with us at some point you see right if we keep rejecting him at some point he won't deal with you anymore the bible says that he won't strive with man forever amen praise god but but by if possible live peaceably with all men verse 19 dearly beloved avenge not yourselves don't try to get you know get even yourself but rather give place unto wrath in other words don't don't don't get angry don't let wrath take over you amen for it is written vengeance is mine i will repay seth the lord amen somebody did something to you in life somebody didn't amen just forget about it let god take care of it if it's not taking care of this life it will be taking care of the other amen therefore verse 20 therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him this is the opposite opposite thinking of what we should we think in in our in our you know in this life if your enemy hungers feed him in other words those that persecute you the most do good to them do the opposite amen do the opposite no matter who it is feed him if he thirsts give him to drink for in so doing watch what happens when you do this for in so doing thou shall heap coals of fire on his head in other words what you're going to do is you're going to put them to shame by your good behavior i know we've all heard these things but i love i love just looking at the verses and just and looking at them amen you put to shame the people that try to do evil to you amen by you doing good to them but you you you let them see oh my goodness what am i doing you put them to shame praise god you know one a good example is david the way he treated king saul and saul being his enemy well at least he was he he hated david because he had a demon but yet david never disrespected saul had the opportunity several times to even kill him and never did he said i cannot lay my hands on the lord's anointing and david did not have the holy ghost how much more us with the holy ghost how should we act amen praise the lord amen in verse 21 last verse here be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with with bad overcome evil with good amen saints i know that each and every one of us we're humans and we want to see justice i mean i'd love to see some justice especially in the day that we're living in oh my goodness you watched somebody committed a horrible crime killed somebody or whatever and you you want to see some justice right but but but then if you step back and you look and you try to look through the eyes of god amen you realize that person also has a soul no matter what horrible thing that they're they're they're engaged in or what they did amen you could be the opportunity you could be that avenue amen for that person to even come to christ we hear we hear many testimonies like that amen where where somebody chose because maybe they murdered their son murdered their daughter but but but they chose to not be hateful not to be spiteful not to be vengeful and because of that attitude amen they win people those criminals for christ amen that's powerful praise the lord jesus amen i want to just finish with this look what brother branham says here in christ the mystery of god revealed we all have we all know this this quote and i don't i don't know if i'll read it all but we'll see how it goes but it's pretty lengthy amen christ the mystery god revealed look what brother brown says here love one another above everything love one another above everything don't no matter what the devil tries to say now you're all one great big sweet group now he was talking to the tabernacle there but remember my warning see satan won't let that stay that way no sir he'll shoot everything if he has to bring somebody in to make his target he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in and sit him down and cause him to fellowship with you under the quietness and things and then he'll shoot that guy with some kind of a poison poison stuff and he'll start through the church with it amen don't don't you take sides with it brother branham says don't you have nothing to do with anything else he says you stay right loving and sweet and kind to one another pray for that man that he'll be saved to or that woman or ever who it is just pray for them and watch and stick one with another and stay with your pastor see he's the shepherd and you give him respects he'll lead you through and call and cause he's ordained of god to do so amen now do you remember that congregation says amen the enemy will come and when he does just cling that much closer together all right and i know here is the church you all have seen the enemy coming all the time amen best thing to do is just cling closer to one another amen that's part of fulfilling the law of christ amen and the one that the devil is using for an enemy will either get out or come in and be one of you that's all don't ever clan among one or talk make yours or make yourself clannish amen we are one i couldn't say left hand i'm i'm mad at you i'm going to take you away because you're not a right hand he's my left hand i want him to stay there even the little tip of my finger i want to stay right there every little part of my body stay right there you don't want any part of your body to be gone no matter if it's malfunctioning amen bella she's been having some problem with one of her eyes since yesterday but i'm sure she doesn't want her eye to be plucked out let's give that as an example you see we want to try to stay together you wanted to keep it intact right bella you want your eye to still stay and you just want it to be to get better all right even the little tip of my finger i want to stay right there every little part of my body stay right there and god wants us as a body of believers to stay right exactly with one another right right at with one another and now you've got tapes on that you've got tapes on what we believe you've got tapes on discipline in the church how we behave ourself in the church of god how we got to come here together and sit together in heavenly places don't stay home don't stay home if god is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in here to fellowship with your brothers that's part of the love of christ if you don't if you don't feel that way then i tell you it's time you got to go praying because watch what he says because we're in the last days do you believe we're in the last days brother branham was saying that in 1963 i believe this was how much more now because we're in the last days where the bible exhorted us to much more as we see that day approaching to love one another with christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in heavenly places and in christ jesus and love one another this will all men know you are my disciples when you have love one for the other that's right and he says again stay right together if the brother oh my goodness let me read right here if the brother you think he's a little wrong or the sister say lord don't let me never have the root of bitterness spring up because it'll it'll affect him and it'll take the christ right out of my life you think somebody's a little wrong amen just pray for him amen but don't ever let root of bitterness say man get into your heart because eventually that will show it will grow into a tree amen and it'll take the christ right out of my life that poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred that will just take the holy spirit right away from you it will run him from the tabernacle here it'll kill the spirit of god or drive it away from here or hurt your pastor it'll do everything just that little root of bitterness so any little root of bitterness that we may have against somebody just get it right make it right just talk about it talk mate just just just talk about it amen hurt your pastor it'll do everything you just wax that much closer together draw up the take the buckle as the brother testified a minister here the other night about having a buckle seeing it in a vision just that buckles on the whole armor of god just pull her on tighten up move right up close to one another love one another anyhow amen talk nice about one another say nice things about one another amen and then god will bless you just pull closer together amen when you see satan amen when you when with you with the spirit of god in you amen what happens when the enemy comes in you raise up a standard because you got the same spirit it's the spirit that raises the standard it's the spirit in you that raises that standard amen but you be the one amen amen so i know we've all read that quote amen we might read it again because it's so good as a reminder amen because i i i'd like i have one more thing i want to talk about this before we finish up this little series and we might just read this again but it's good to remind ourselves amen because this is real this is reality i mean brother branham you go back and listen to this yourself amen but but when you take the time to just kind of read it and just dissect it a little bit it uh like this is reality not just the tabernacle that brother branham was at suffered these things amen how much more our church and the other churches amen they go through these exact same things so let's stay closer together amen the world wants to divide us the world wants to divide you amen but you stay close together you don't have to listen to what the world says you listen to what god said and god is calling for love god's calling for unity while the world is calling for social distance and all this kind of stuff god's calling for unity and and love right amen stay with i just want to stay with what god said amen amen i want to say with what he says amen because the word of man will fail but god will never fail amen let's stand to our feet praise god let's sing the song i want to live the way he wants me to live amen i want to love love till there's just no more love i believe it's key of f sister esther i want to live [Music] the way he wants me to live i want to give until there's just no more to give i want to [Music] just no more love i could never ever i'll love the lord saying it
