father but may you do the speaking Lord May the hearers come to hear father may we all get something from you today Lord You're the alls sufficient one you're the Eternal one you're the one that before the foundation of the world knew the words that would be spoken today what a mighty God lord you know all of our needs but Lord as as a prophet said he God loves for you to remind him of what he said so Lord you said by your stripes we're heal and Lord I pray for those that have the flu Lord and those flu like symptoms that they would be taken away and the ones that have not had it Lord that we won't get it either and father I pray that you'd bless us now take care of us be with a little bride around the world in Jesus name amen God bless you uh we're on part 15 of transition to Perfection we're going to talk about the three polls today now when we are in our journey am I am I own up here they cut they cut this thing on for me so maybe they'll get it started but as we start into this third pull let me give you something really quick to look at before we read the scripture and before we get started now remember you and I are under an Elijah anointing all right an Elijah anointing now remember brother R gave us the characteristics of that Elijah anointing he'll be a man of the Wilderness he'll be this and that and the other all those different things hate women and and all that stuff so there's a characteristic now when we get started in the third pool you wonder well why is brother R talking about fishing and hooks and eyelets and well he's a prophet he's an Elijah Prophet he's a man of the woods he knew how to catch rainbow trout but remember that's all an allegory to put together to why we're here because of his ministry we are here and we must go through those same three polls in our journey not in the vision like he was in but in the message of the hour if Jesus had three poles Noah had three poles different ones had three poles then you and I have got three poles in our journey and we'll try to get into that if we don't then we'll get into it a little bit later but let's go to First Corinthians but as it is written I ha Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither ha entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him he's already got this prepared if we Agape him not filo him I love what brother Aaron was speaking Wednesday night he's a lot of people's savior but he's a your lord I told him I'd been battling for about 3 weeks of what to preach in down at the Methodist Church in a couple of Sundays that's what I'm going to preach he gave me the sermon I pre I think God give me the sermon not him amen because many people have made him the Savior but have you made him your lord and claimed lordship that's why we're baptized he claims Us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ all right sorry but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things ye the Deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in it even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know or understand or see the things that are freely given to us of God you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing do you believe that freely given to us by God but we have to want it we have to make ourself as brother R said make yourself available for the word of God we must make ourself as we say Open the Eyes of our heart all those years and then we we talk about you know Open the Eyes of My Heart Open the Eyes of My Heart what is your heart your heart's your soul open that up don't open it up for the world open it up for God all right let God speak to you today now the Bible tells us I take this one thought when I talk about the three polls we know that was personal for brother brandham all right everybody with me we'll get into it in just a second that was personal for him but it wasn't so personal that he kept it to his own self he told it he told what it was and then even even the we'll read it here in a minute the angel says this is that third pole so he is identifying what brother Brown's going through okay it's not just brother I'm coming up with three PS the angel told him the angel was the one that was in there and he said it was the angel remember he said the the voice that spoke to me come around in front of me and he was had his arms folded and he had on a turban look middle easterner that's pretty vivid that's pretty vivid but he was there what was he doing he was guiding brother brandham through that Vision all right now many interpretations have come up through that Vision but I know I'm just going to tell you what brother Ram said and then we'll U uh you can make your own assumption but why did he tell it he told it so that you and I can see where he's coming from cuz if I can see where somebody's coming from I can try to understand him a lot more right so those three plls were given to me so that I can understand that I have three stages in my Christian Journey justification sanctification baptism of Holy Ghost and we know that there's layers there that he even said you'll be Fishers of Men cuz he was fishing and same way with all of us as Ministry today we are Fishers of Men we're out fishing for fish that will learn or that will take the bait now remember Divine Healing though was the bait on the hook not the hook all right the hook was get them into the message of the hour everybody with me but you got to give them you got to present you we'll read it he present he knew how to do it he was a fisherman he he was got a little bit caught up in his he really did because remember the angel of the Lord said this is your problem somebody me brother a was talking about or somebody was talking about there being stupid brother Brown called himself stupid in that dream he said God forgive your stupid servant remember when he got the line all tangled up well what was he trying to do he was trying to tell brother R said look you're a fisher of men this is what you got to do don't get tangled up in times like this that's what the angel of the Lord said don't get tangled up in times like these in other words what's he telling now that that dream was a long time for to seal open come on I'll read it to you in just a minute it was in the 50s okay so don't get your line Tangled Up In other words you got to straighten out everything because I'm going to bring when I bring you the seals that's when you going to really start catching those real big rainbow trout trophies you and I today are the recipient are you and I are trophies of brother brandom throwing the line out and catching you by the word of God God by the word of God not by Brother Randon by the word of God he was debate on the hook the hook is what you're getting which is Jesus Christ the same yesterday day and forever there's no way the prophet of God ever turned anybody to himself never did he do that second Corinthians your Epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men when I was looking through some of this yesterday or day before yesterday and you look at this and you if you've been in the message how many's been in the message 10 years or less wow so it's been over 10 years every well and 10 years Michael 10 years or less all right so we must be pretty seasoned veterans right okay and you've heard of the third poll or the three polls or this is happen and and people speak of the Third third pole but if you really studied it for yourself not just what somebody said you got to study it for yourself cuz you have that same journey to go through do you know you are Fishers of Men also even though you're not ministers because somebody will be attracted or distracted with who you are and what you are and either they'll take the Baer they want a lot of you sitting here where the recipients of of brother Dale work in General Motors I know a lot have passed away but when the church was in the 80s and the early '90s it was full of people that that brother that brother Dale had cast a line out all right down there in General Motors and we're recipients of that of that catching of the fish and then brother dick caught fish and then brother col uh brother colie still here brother Al different ones they caught fish cuz look at it now somebody caught your attention didn't they no I got it from the paper you didn't get it from no paper you don't get this message from a paper you get this message by a Vindicated prophet and you believing he was and believe what he said so you are Epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men not to bring anything to oursel now because we're nothing but when we get into the Millennium when we get into the future home we're going to be special we're going to be the ones that's overcome we're going to be the ones that's overcome the devil we're going to be ones us overcome death and people are going to look at us and go wow you get to live in the city yes we get to live in a city because what did we do down here we became listen to me we became the message of the hour for our day we became that we didn't just go through the motions it's written about all of us that's right he talks about the bride that's you he he's calling your name your name is called every service you ought to say that ain't nothing but the truth find something for as much as you are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ so all right expressly manifest declared Epistle of Christ ministered by us now Paul was pretty specific got it from him or you didn't get it from nobody else all right I'm sorry I'm just telling this is Bible written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart we'll skip right there just a second because as we were talking the other day the great mystery is that you and I are standing here sitting here today walking through time here today Eternal beings if you're born again you're an eternal being doesn't matter what happens to you in the next 10 seconds 5 Seconds hours two hours days you're Eternal beings by the new birth you're sitting here with a soul that is eternal that's a mystery that is the mystery what is the mystery Paul said the mystery is Christ in you the hope of glory now if Christ is in you that makes you bride it don't make you a church member it don't make you a foolish virgin right makes you bride it makes you that Genesis 126 person not not like it but part of it listen that was a literal part of God himself he's the only one that can subdivide and not get any weaker that's right cuz he's a Creator we were created in His image formed in His image there was no time that we didn't exist but we didn't know that we had to come down here and that Mind Of God come to us gave us New Birth and as Paul said now we have the mind of Christ sure we make mistakes sure we got all these Devils that we worry about and I keep right here every day but what are we when are we going to stand up and say I am amen that I am I am that I am I'm that person yeah but all the devil just jumped on your back now and said well you did this yesterday and the day before to day remember remember as brother Aaron always said when Satan's talking he's lying when he's opening his mouth when he's moving his lips he's lying okay he might tell part of the truth but he'll never tell the whole truth but you and I are be able to stand up though and stand up in front of the devil and say devil whatever you're saying that ain't true it may look bad but why are we looking I thought we're supposed to believe the things that we can't see that makes us a believer you don't have to believe that I'm going to be at church today you may have at 10:00 or 9:00 but I am here you are here yes and that's what God is in the word of God sure we have a journey we have the three plls we go through justifica listen Paul said I Die daily so we go through sanctification process every single day if you're a Christian I mean there's things you do that you say God I'm so sorry I did that now pray for me if you got all if you're all that perfect and you got it all worked out come up here and help us I'm not kidding you there's things we have to look at worry about every single day but that doesn't deter me from studying to try to get us in a Rapture so it's not the letter but the spirit for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life and where is that spirit it's inside of me and you that's sister cleta brought me a uh she was want to know where brother R said that that Jesus never uh his foot never touched the Earth until the Millennium well he doesn't really that's one of those quotes that he really don't say that but I did but I did find where brother Brown said that Jesus will not be on earth until the Millennium don't look for his body of Flesh listen don't even look for his body of Flesh when we take a rapture we meet him in the air thank god brother Brandon was scripturally correct when he was in that Sage field and he was praying and the Lord appeared to him what'd he say he was 78 feet off the ground that was very scriptural cuz if he'd have been standing on the ground walking to him that wouldn't have been scriptural he was up in the air but we're going to meet him in the air but listen he has endued us with power so much he's going to give us that Authority on Earth as he as he did Adam and listen you and I are not going to lose that Authority we're going to win we're going to take us back to [Applause] Eden listen if you're a Christian today this is off subject but there's an Eden somewhere in you somewhere there's a piece that passes all understanding can't you read scripture you say well I'm just so beat well pray to God that he give you some kind of Peace somewhere okay cuz you'll drive yourself crazy Lord whatever happens I know it's for my good CU you said you'd never put anything on us more than we can stand I depend on that because sometimes it piles up pretty high amen right just true it just piles up the reason I said her is her you know you did y'all see the um baptismal services that brother Joe pulled up from the 90s who walked in the water well Josh was one Timothy Dy was one and then the other one was Robbie and a couple other people and there was Robbie getting baptized well you know what that may not have worked back then for him but it will catch up with him somewhere and it will for the same for some of you that have children that have come through and went and baptized and and came to church but then when they got older they left and I am one of them but God calls you in his time he calls you in his time not your time not your mama's time not your daddy's time he calls him in your time you know why because you can only be ready for God God when you're ready for God you hear me you understand that you can only be ready for God when you're ready for God I got to where I didn't I hated what I was doing I hated my life I hated what was going on I hated it so much I said I don't want this no more amen you so that's too simple that's the way the gospel is it's so simple get sick and tired of being sick and tired present it to God he's right there amen he's not you you don't have to scream he answered and said unto them now this is Jesus talking to the disciples but he's talking to me and you all right with me because it is given unto you not somebody else it's given unto you to know no see understand now listen I'm going to interpolate just a second the mysteries of the Kingdom for your time because look it says but to them it is not given go listen visible Union 1965 brother Ram he said the word that fell in the day Pentecost will not work this day no sir that was for Pentecost this is for the bride going home of the Bride we got some something different I'm just reading you quote the Pentecostals represented that again wherein the bride age no more than the word of Noah would work in the day of Moses no more than Moses's law would have worked in the time of Paul he tried to tell them you are dead to that and you cannot have that so down to the church ages he's given it to each Church age by portion but you and I are to be the fullness of the godhead bottle in the end time so he gave us the full Revelation he gave us the as brother R said the Myster is now history 1 Corinthians 10:1 now all these things happen unto them for example talking about the Old Testament and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come you and I are standing here right here today if you see what's going on around a country and around the nation this is it the world's not going to stand this anymore so what's the great secret mystery you and that you can hold your head above what's going on in the world we fall every day but you know what brother R said look he said what is the true Mark of a true Christian you get up you get up and you continue again you get up and continue again I was I looked for that quote the other day I quoted it where that guy was getting ready to have a a meeting in a town and he's washing the windows and getting everything ready and the bully walks in and he says um what are you doing Mist said well I'm having a meeting here he said well you got to whip me first he said brother R said he climbed down climb down off off off of the ladder he said he pulled his jacket off and I don't think he even give that guy time enough to do anything he said by the time he had him down he was on the ground and he was saying I must fight that I may win I must fight that I may win and he beat that guy up and then the guy got saved that night or the next night got he may have took a day off but after he got wept but he got saved in the meeting so we got a fight to win now watch Christ Ministry of God reveal but when the current is Flowing freely the word of God it expresses itself The Works that I do shall be you be also and in the last days it shall come to pass behold I sent to you Elijah the prophet now here he's telling us what's what's coming and we know it's there but he's telling us what's coming we know he was it behold I send you Elijah the prophet and he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers all right now that was remember there's two parts one part was what turning back to the faith of the fathers now watch and in there in there the second part the the pyramid that I told you you could read what was on the outside and he said all that on the outside I told him what it was he said but there was an Unwritten part on the inside that had to be interpreted by only by a prophet that's what he's talking about right there and in there there would be a Time come forth when he could express himself in fullness of his godhead deity through his church have the preeminence in this church oh my what the anointed man now the anoint OED people oh my what to bring back the anointed bride and bridegroom anointed by why accepting what Eve turned down and Adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit Anointed with the word what Eve turned down he comes back and we accept all right John 15 ver4 says abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself I think somebody read that today except it abide in the vine no more nor can ye except you abide in me I am the vine you are the branches he that abideth in me and look and I in him flow through the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing I say Amen to all that now watch what brother Brown talks about he talks about the Book of Revelations so it's an uncovering revealing what was previous ly hid now the uncovering is not only the revelation of the person of Christ he talking about the Book of Revelation but it is the revelation of his future work in the oncoming seven Church ages now who encompasses seven Church ages why are they seven Church agents why are they seven Messengers because there's seven groups of people that's going to take it and live it so it's not just seven Church ages it's the people in the age right amen remember you say the whole city came out to see the parade well all the buildings didn't jump up to the to the sidewalk no it was the people listen you and I come on somebody you and I are the people of the city we've come out to see now the whole world's going to come out to see you cuz God's going to not put you a b bystander he's going to put you in the parade remember remember the dream he the were the bride was put into view might have been a few got out of Step but they got back in everybody with me so you were put on preview that was you when I look at this and I read this I I look at this and I say God you're talking to me you're not talking to people sitting in the in the in the room at that time you're talking to me I'm the one who the ends of the world come upon I'm the on who the Mysteries are to be revealed I'm the one to where we our heart is open to where we go back to the faith of the fathers and then we're able as he took the unwritten part you know what he did he took the unwritten part and made it written in 1100 sermons he took it and made it written where you can read it and become it praise God for the print and press I know we're all digestal now and all that but thank God for those old books Hall remembering the Lord 1963 listen if there's anything we're lacking let's do it if there's anything lacking with us let's get back to that let's remember what he required not what we think we ought to have but what he said we got to have we got to have it that way the way he said it so you can't come any other way remember there some people try to get in the back door they some people tried to get in through the window and they were tossed out of the party right let's don't be tossed out of the party you have an invitation today to put on that robe and walk straight into that door walk boldly to the FR to the throne of God Walk boldly and say God I need this this is what I need today this is what I need tomorrow you don't know what you need tomorrow yet but when you get to tomorrow you don't know what you need praise the Lord so it's not discernment now brother R we were talking the other day about the new ministry brother R thought it was a something new with prayer lines it wasn't that's why he kept 1958 5960 I read you all those a little bit later on I mean a little bit beforehand he was searching for a new ministry and he kept wanting to know you know was it something to do with the prayer line it was not it was the opening of the word the Seven Seals to be revealed to the people and you know what that's going to do that's going to change our body that's going to put us through that little tent that little room so all us deser discernment was to knowing the very secrets of the heart and we always put it to the prayer line but you remember brother brandham he's he's preaching along and he says hey don't think that hey don't think that I'm sure glad I don't have that gift hey don't think that when he when everything was coming at him while he was preaching several tapes he say you don't know what just passed before me something in a vision passed before him of either what was going on or what he had said or something going on in the congregation that's discernment but listen that discernment now was in one man as a gift one gift to one generation everybody with me now it's Discerning the thoughts and intents of the Heart by the word of God that's brother B was talking about listen we are judged every time we walk in this building you're judged listen you're even judged every time you read the Bible or a a message a message book our tape for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing and Su of Soul and Spirit and of the joints and Marrow and discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart there's no one that I can figure out in history or look back and see where that some man stood in the pull pit and say there's three of you you got this Center realm you got this next realm then you got this realm right Paul spoke of it see there's there's to me that's the letter of the mystery Paul said I pray that your whole body Soul and Spirit be preserved but I don't know that he ever recorded that he said now you got five senses in this realm you got five in this realm and only one in this one right and that's you and kids I'm sorry if you cut yourself this way in half there's not three rings for some of us if you cut US Open like a tree there'd be a lot of rings CU rings tell how old you are the rings of the tree well praise the Lord anyhow so it's not it you're intertwined as a as a human being when you're born you have a spirit spirit and a soul your mom and daddy gives you the body through what was set up in the garden through desire man man Mom and Daddy everybody with me but then God puts inside of you something for you to live by sorry I'm getting off subject a little bit but still there's an inside part of us that's the even when you listen the reason I did things wrong is because in my sa emanated evil and you say oh evil anything against God's word is evil okay I wasn't a murderer I did it with my mouth liar yeah all those different things but I had representation that one day that that thing was going to die inside of me because I I come to the place I didn't want that no more and so God I believe gave he birthed me into the body closed that up sealed it till the day of the Redemption but now remember the devil just took got out of that house and went into the next real well pray for me he got into that second ring and started playing around by my memory reason conscious affection imagination just like three PS you got three 's amen now listen you're not schizophrenic there's not three personalities I hope but there's three ways that God contacts you by your spirit and soul and then your body reacts okay just as brother brandom was come to the first pole he come to the second pole and he come to the third pole cuz I read to you here in just a minute so just keep that hold that in your mind and notice the next thing now watch here he took a bar and cut off the rock the inside of the rock that had nothing wrot on it now listen he's in a vision he's telling us that but remember there's another one coming up where he said there was an Unwritten part all right and at time I started to the west and I told him I said don't go west stay here and look on this till I return went West for the blast returned back to the east with the Holy Spirit interpreting this Unwritten word so now when they all looked in brother Aaron they looked in that in the dream they looked into that the box was tore off right everybody with me the the pyramid was tore off they knew what was around here because he said hey stay and look on this but there was a part of White Rock that there was nothing written on well now right now he's telling us that he's interpretating what was in that rock what a secret that's a secret that only he knew that he had the mind of God and he gave it to you and I right we not can only understand the unwritten part we are the unwritten part now for that isn't perfectly God Almighty I want you to know what it is what I'm trying to say this for friends is to show you we're at the end time so now let's look at the three pulls just for a minute now pull means now remember he didn't say push okay he said pull you can't be pushed into this we people have tried but that pull is the pull of the Holy Ghost on your life and my life that Holy Ghost is your LIF line he's going to talk about lines here fishing lines the Holy Ghost is your lifeline it's out there but it's not going to attach itself to you you got to come and bite it so a pull means a Force drawing someone or something in a particular direction remember it's not for anybody else it's for us in a particular direction or course of action so what's God doing through your life he's pulling you through each stage of your life and you must know that we get stuck in Seasons we get stuck in times that's okay as I said before don't lay down get back up take off amen amen they God I'm sorry so now here's the dream this is the 1956 is when he had this dream or Vision all right everybody with me stay with me y'all doing pretty good and at that time and at that the angel of the Lord taken me out then he taken me to a real bright stream of water it was the most beautiful blue water now what is water water is people water is people all right it was the most beautiful blue water and great fish were swimming around in it in one interpretation not in one interpretation but in one time he tells it again it was big large rainbow trout okay and you know he you know brother R held the world record for several years for the largest rainbow trout ever caught on whatever line he was catching it on it's in the den now but I mean somebody's beat that since then but during the time right here it'll I don't think this one but the next one he tells them he said well I've got one hanging on the wall That's world record I believe he caught world record rainbow trout right here and right there he was taking me to a real bright stream all right he said I will make you a Fisher now look who is he he is the Angel of the Lord what he said now watch hold on the angel of the Lord taken me out then all right so now cast your lure into the water and when you do pull it slow first time the next time just give it a little jerk not too hard and the next time set your hook for the catch first time second time third time right and I started to throw my line in the water I pulled and everybody began rejoicing and saying that's wonderful that's wonderful I got all excited somewhere in another version of this brother r says he saw and discerned that it was preachers and he said that's when I get in trouble when I get around a lot of preachers all right that's what he said amen so anyway that's wonderful that's wonderful I got all excited and jerked it hard on the next one out I pulled the fish and all out of the water and what it was it was a little bitty fish and it was about the size of the lure and I got my line all tangled up and I was straightening out my line and the man which was talking behind me walked around in front of me dressed in Palestinian clothes and a turban on his head he had a white robe he said brother brandom that's it I said I know I don't do right a prophet admitting he didn't do right so now stop right here and I'll explain them the first pull right second pull third pole the the angel is fixing to admonish him for trying to to explain it got his line all tangled up why he kept trying to explain it it caused impersonation it called all this let's let's just keep going don't I I jerked it when I ought not to he said don't get your line tangled up in these kind of times and I said well I'm running it as straight as I can I'll be very careful he said now the first time I spoke with you he knew who he was talking to it wasn't an unfamiliar voice that's right you put your hands on the people and told them what was wrong with them now for those of you that are new in the message or have been here not too long he used to take them by the hand he'd hold their hand and they would turn different colors there would be bumps on it I don't know how he deciphered all that but I know it was God anyway because the only thing he would say was he'd said well you got this and this and then he he'd grab or hold them again or still hold on to them he says see they're gone you're healed that was a simple form pretty simple to grab somebody by the hand and you look in yourself me you're looking at the hand and his hand turns all these different colors cuz remember he gave Moses the same sign he said put your hand in your bosom pulled it out it was leprosy he said put it back put it back in brought it out and it wasn't cuz the angel tells him said I've give Moses three signs I'll give you three signs all right but now remember your sign and my sign is didn't come from Moses it came came from a end time Prophet an Elijah that was a Wilderness man and and thank God that he had a Wilderness mind and he can understand this this ain't the first time he'd been fishing okay and told him what was wrong with him and the second pull while when you did you would know the secrets of their hearts all right that was when he wouldn't take them by the hand he'd look right at them and one of the he said ma'am he said I'm not looking at you he said I'm looking at your past a little screen would open up somewhere and he just sat there and watched the television of their life so it's all recorded but remember what he said he said but if you put it under the blood I can't see it God can't see it problem was is a lot of people didn't know how to put it under the blood we do and the the second pull while when you did you would know the secrets of their heart and I made you a sear before the people but you was always trying to explain it you ought to have done that and he said you made a public showing of it all right this is where he got his line tangled up I said oh I'm very sorry then he taken me from there and I seen a great huge tent and I took him from fishing to a tent still Wilderness if you're a wilderness guy you can live in a tent everybody with me all right it was a cathedral it was a tent and he taken me from there and I seen a great huge tent never seen such a tent and it was packed in lined everywhere with people and I walked out to the looked like I was standing above the people looking down where I had just made an alter call and hundreds and hundreds of people were weeping and rejoicing after they had accepted the Lord Jesus's the Savior and I looked and then heard a man get up and say call the prayer line and the people began to line up over on this side the left from where I was looking down towards the platform and they lined all the way up and down the street for a prayer line I noticed to my left which wouldn't have been would have been to my right if he was on the platform a little wooden building and I seen that the light that all they have the picture of it of you know that's always in the ings I've seen that light leave me and go to that building now what is the light what's the light the angel of the Lord the angel of the Lord all right so he's talking about the angel of the Lord I seen that light leave me and go to that building and go in that building now remember this is all allegory right this is all an example this is all something that we can see by spiritual eye not a white tent setting out somewhere in Jeffersonville everywhere they think they going to put it sorry listen if this over here was an allegory the fishing and the catching and making you Fishers and doing all this and explaining you can't make this over here natural people try to make it natural there's only one tent God's worried about that's yours the tent you walk in every day is the tent that God's talking about remember I just read you not in fleshly tables but in the secret in your heart or fleshly tables of your heart that's where it's written right and I seen that light they have the picture of it now remember that's the angel of the Lord I seen that light leave me and go to that building and go in that building and a voice said to me I'll meet you in there that'll be the third pull all right I'll meet you in there that'll be the third pole all right is everybody with me I'm G slow down just for a second so you can get this I said why brother R had a question he said well it won't be a public show like the others I'm telling you that's what the angel said it won't be a public show by the like the others huge prayer lines and and thousands of people healed and hundreds of thousands of people healed he's telling brother brandham and I believe brother Bram caught after here in just a second that he was looking he was listen if he was fishing for men here he's still trying to get me in here but what he's done is he's took somebody from baby form to maturity knowing that that same Angel of the Lord is the same one that bir you in your temple bir you in your who came to you at your new birth brother brandham didn't brother Dale didn't the pastor didn't God himself came the angel of the Lord the one at the picture was tuck it not only shines above us it it goes in US it says right here went in the building and I'm sorry if you're waiting for something like that to happen that's fine you ever seen that movie Left Behind if it's something physical then the dream changed it's got to be something if it's spiritual start it's got to be spiritual end right if you don't then you've changed everything brother Adam every pattern he has told us when if it was a spiritual dream then it went all the way through as a spiritual dream or spiritual happening so it won't be a public show like the others and I was going to insert here where brother R comes up on the questions and answers on the seals and he said you're not getting it you're outside this part of the little room sorry may get in trouble but he's telling them the angel of Lord's telling them say look you're not going to speak before 25,000 people and they all get healed again right cuz remember end of his ministry what was he doing he preached a token message with 30 something people in a trailer but it won't be a public show like the others the end of the time of the end sir now this is right before the seals this is this is right after this happened right or right before this happened no right after this happened is that is this the mystery the whole message of sign of the end sir was a question asking you and and himself what was going on is this the end of the end of it sir sir is this the end time is this the mystery of the Thunders that will bring back The Headstone you know the pyramid never was capped The Headstone is yet to come now this is 1962 preached us back to the faith of the fathers what is The Headstone the seals the opening the seals the power back to the church the ministry of Jesus Christ the son of man the pyramid never was cap The Headstone is yet to come it's been rejected could it be brothers sisters oh is this that third pull that he told me 3 or four years ago the first pull you remember what happened I tried to explain it he said don't do that the second pull he said don't try and I pulled anyway you remember congregation says yes all of you remember it's on tape and everything and then he said now there's a third pull coming now remember he didn't say anything about tent nothing now there's a third pull coming but don't try to explain it you see how I approach this tonight I don't know remember brother brandham on the first seal he said I didn't know nothing it was way past my thinking I was getting my old notes out I was going to preach like I preached it in 1957 or 58 preach them all in one night you see how I approached it this this tonight I don't know but I feel Duty bound to my church to say something you draw your own conclusion right now will this be the mystery that would open up that would bring Christ bring a power to the church see I believe in Repentance being baptized in the name of Jesus Christ we believe in receiving the Holy Ghost we have signs wonders Miracles speaking in tongues and all the things the early church had what was that the faith of the fathers we have that he said and frankly there's been more done right here than is wrote In the book of Acts and this one little group of people this little bitty Ministry of ours here what about the world over more than wrote In the book of Acts same kind the raising of the Dead remember there was only about three people raised of the Dead by Jesus and we have on record doctor's record five works should I do more than that shall you do I know the King James virgin says greater but you couldn't do Greater Works more of it he was in one person then he's in the whole church now right More Than This shall you do for I go un my father if this is the third poll then there is a great ministry lying ahead I can't say I don't know if he's lying he's not a prophet cuz remember when he went into that constellation of angels they told him to go back to Jeffersonville he did not get the revelation of the seals out in Tucson Arizona the angel said go back to Jeffersonville I'll meet you there watch third pull let's stop on that a minute and division now watch he switches from the fish Vision with me good y'all perked up on your seat maybe you'll we'll do this next Sunday no suay after well it is a mystery but it's a mystery we need to understand when somebody says third pull people then and and that is not true to the point to say we're just all third pull people there's First full there's people here that's just in justification that's baby Christians there's sanctification there's different on but we are to be the third pole manifestation of what he's talking about because at the end when they went through that little room they had healing they come in wounded they come in wounded and they left healed boy what a body change watch third pole let's stop on that a minute in the vision the first flight was a little messenger version now he's went to this vision Vision everybody with me read that I didn't bring it but this Vision was he looked and saw a constellation of little birds then the next one that come was bigger then the third was angels that was when that was the little messenger birds that was when we first started it growed from just taking a person by the hand am and you remember what he told me if you'll be sincere it'll come to pass that you know the very secret of the heart how many remembers that announced from here and Across the Nation congregation says amen and it did happen congregation says amen exactly then he said Don't Fear I'll be with you see and it shall go on now the first pull was little be Birds they went on to meet the time all right meet the time meet the coming of the Lord the first message the second time the secrets of the heart from taking a person by the hand and just standing there and saying what they had the next time it revealed their sins and told them what to do now what does the word do the word does that all right brother bam had come to a place in his ministry that he was coming to the full manifest manifestation of the word of God congregation says amen then that come to pass perfectly I want to ask these people that that's got all this garbage going on about brother BR he's so specific they ain't nobody can make this up and keep it right and keep it straight and keep it scriptural I know we don't know none of us but if anybody does come Among Us or anything you tell them come talk to me come talk to me about this we'll talk about this because brother Ron was a human no doubt but he brought a perfect word of God and he was very scriptural and you are witnesses and so is the world so is the church when I said I saw an angel and it was an emerald fire burning people laughed said Billy Get Next To Yourself the magic scientific eye of the camera took it downstairs as a picture over his head it wasn't lying I was telling the truth God Vindicated I said Darkness overshadows death then it's white remember the picture he took of somebody took a picture of the woman he announced that she was dying of cancer and there was all you could see was a her body from here down and it was black from here up then he pronounced her healed and the person took another picture and it was totally gone I said Darkness overshadows it's death black and this is white one is life the other one's death and there it is on the picture back there as George J Lacy said the mechanical eye of this camera won't take psychology are you following me congregation said amen all right now watch we'll be done right here notice the first little flight hand all right everybody with me first little flight hand the second was greater White fighter doves Holy Spirit revealing the secrets of the heart and the third flight was Angels not Birds angels and that's the end time that's all of it will this be the time brother is this the time now he said listen don't interpret it don't misinterpret this he's talking about the church and knowing the scientific eye of the camera and all that stuff and I watch what did John do John was the first one he said behold Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world that's him is the hour has it arrived my brethren I don't say it has I don't know but I'm asking you I want you to think or will this be the time when it will be again Behold the Lamb of God or the time of Malachi 4 to return the hearts of the children back to the Faith of Our Fathers will it be such a blast that will do such Mighty things until it will set the church that's been slopping or sloping slopping and cannot understand the mysteries of God and so forth when they see that Mighty blast sweep forth will it turn their hearts back to the father as the Bible said it would or was this the message already passed that should have done it it was a message in the past that already took us back to the faith of the fathers everybody with me on that all right KN once at the end time now the very day when this messenger not when he starts on not in the 47 but when he begins to declare his message all right his message the first pull healing the second pull prophesying third pull the opening of the word the Mysteries reveal now it's 1965 he's only a few months before he's taken off the scene he's finally honing it down to where he knows where it's at he knows what's going on and he knows what he's got to do I just believe that there's no more Mighty order to reveal the word than a prophet and the third poll was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word so was in prison the second pull was discer of the spirits to prophecy first was The Healing The Sick second was the prophecy that went forth and know the secrets of the thoughts when the word itself was made manifest which that's great but remember the seventh is the Finish could this be the Finish finish pull it's all over could it be think of it now where we at seven is always to finish three plls Jesus's Ministry consisted of three plls did you know that now remember Jesus's Ministry had three poles Noah's Ministry had three poles everybody with me all right let me get through this real quick brother um um whatever his name is brother L brother l get ready cuz we'll do this I want you look now the first pull was Healing The Sick second Ministry prophesying first Min third Ministry was preaching to the eternally lost the three mountains so forth lost Eternal Noah's Ministry all Ministries done the same Noah preached that's exactly right he went into the ark and when he went into the ark there was seven days that nothing happened his testimony preached to the doomed Amen in the day of Sodom they had three polls we keep talking here just a second let's get down to right here now brother randam when is all this going to happen Christ's mystery of God revealed we' we've read this Brother D has read it many many many times but if you'll turn and look at the clock now he's at the end of his sermon it's at 2:00 he preached a long sermon but if you'll turn around look at the clock now if you're spiritual you watch spiritual things it's on the dot 2:00 the end of the second pull the third pull is at hand now when was that that was right after the seals come July of 1963 so what was the first pull the first pull was taken on of hands look at his hand all right um let me say this that was simple part okay then the next part was a little more hard he had to know what was going on yesterday the day before and what's going to happen the next day right and the third pull was standing there opening a word to them and they not getting it getting pieces and parts now listen one more we'll close right here and then when that time comes it's tightening when is this this is um look away to Jesus 1963 12:29 the end of the year preach the seals then when that time comes and the Press comes to a place to where you're pressed out then watch what I'm fixing to tell you in a few minutes watch the third pull then now look three things it'll be for the bride to the church and to the totally lost the third pool has three parts the bride will catch it the church will be rejected and whoever's not in will never be able to get in again ever let's pray for our people just pray for the ones that are not here just pray for the ones that's out in the world because me and sister C was talking a few minutes ago it can't go much longer he just can't look at the world they're even now talking about every going to the Bitcoin thing and going to the whatever that other um cryptocurrency and all that stuff when the rich get richer the poor get poor but you should never look at the news and worry you should never look at the news come on brother um Lise you should never look at that and worry about what's going to happen next we know for a fact the United States is going to have to be so powerful that it speaks for the mother Church everybody with me that was told thus sayith the Lord by brother brandham and we're in Revelations 13 the image to the Beast that has to have power to speak for the Beast well who in the world standing there now that guy's got more power than anybody's ever had and that's all right would you remember what president- elect Trump said and it's it's on YouTube you can pull it up he said if you Christians will vote for me he said it'll be the last time you ever vote I say that's absolutely the truth but he wasn't talking to them he's talking to me cuz that's only 4 years we're going to get out of here I believe before 4 years so we won't ever have to vote for nobody else we better vote for Jesus Christ and forget the rest but the world's going to do what it's going to do there's going to be a boycott there's going to be different things happening we already know that how it happened we really didn't know but now we did since the last Trump's here so we're done but God bless you we love you with the love of the Lord we are U we are third po people we are the Mysteries revealed you're part of the mystery and you've got to be made known that's what brother randam said she is part of the mystery and got to be made known and brother randam I believe told us one time he said when the door of the Gentile Church closes he said God will anoint a church then well we think we might have a little bit of anointing you just wait but you got to be at the bus station with the bus ticket and you got to be there at the right time right brother Dell had brother Dell told us that years and years he said you can't get if you're going to get on the plane don't go down here and buy a bus ticket and go to the bus station don't walk down to the airport and say I Got My Ticket they said buddy uh you need to be up there no if we got the we got the ticket we got everything we need we just got to get there the journey is continuing God bless you we sure appreciate brother Luise and what he's done in the Foreign Fields and brother Bob going and brother Aaron's

they're going to hook you up back there but God bless you remember all these announcements and things that we're doing um we love you and again thank you for your support from your vote last we week I appreciate it please help me pray that God will give us Revelation and that God will navigate us through all this and not myself that's right but I appreciate all the deacons Elders all the all the people that have anything to do in the church I really appreciate all of you joining together and uh and giving us a a Zeal to do something man without a have you ever just sat down somewhere and said I wonder what I'm doing here well you better know what you're doing here now all right go ahead praise the Lord I guess we'll just use this microphone here um uh I know that our trip for to Honduras with brother Wade was back in December so I know that we're a little bit late on the report but we we've just been in in and out and just so much going on in the last three months so so we haven't been able to give the report and Christine she may say a little something but she was the one who prepared these pictures remember she is my uh secretary and when brother Wade was there she was her her secretary as well his secretary she's the one who takes the pictures because I just can't go around taking pictures when I'm talking to the brothers and things like that and it's and he's interpreting for me so that takes up a lot of his time too I got to be in with the ministers and things and so she's she's reporting all these things so that's why I really need her there amen she's a huge huge asset because she's the one who comes with with these reports and then sends them back to you all so that you all can see them you know as as quick as possible but anyways uh I just want to say once again and I know I've said this I said this last time I really really really I I believe that this trip um two reasons why we took this trip one of them was because this this was one of the last few things that brother Dale did before he passed away this church that we're about to show it was one of the last things that he said let's just help that church you know he'd come up here I'd give a report or something and I'd give a need and he'd just come up here and he'd say let's just go ahead and just give that help that chur and he' just just whatever this was one of the the last one amen and so the brother the brother brother uh Robert which is brother brother Eric Gallo's uh uh father-in-law he um he asked if brother Dale could be there during this ministers meeting that he was going to be holding well when he asked me that I knew brother Dell wasn't well and I knew he couldn't do it and so I told him I said well brother brother Robert I said I may be able to bring brother Wade with me which is his son but I don't think brother Dale will be able to come and he said oh he felt really bad about that so so I'm glad that brother Wade was able to come and it wasn't for it wasn't I'll just say this it wasn't for brother Dale to go during this time it was for brother Wade to go because I believe the people there needed to hear something that he had that that God had to use brother Wade you know to tell them if brother Dale was meant to be there he would have been there I believe that and so and I believe if I would have asked brother Dale I believe he would have probably tried to go if he was being asked to but um but I I really enjoyed myself during this trip because I don't say this because he's my pastor Brother D brother Wade's my pastor and he didn't tell me to tell you this but I've said it before I really really enjoyed interpreting for brother Wade because the way I thought that it was going to be and I knew I know I know in Honduras I know what the people need spiritually amen and uh I know that this type of word is what they need and I knew I know that brother Wade could do it and so it really was a blessing to them and so I appreciate brother way taking his time to go but anyways so we'll just go to the report and um brother way Wade do you fill in in any spot on this if you want to say something you know stop me then we just go on so um but I don't know if the brothers have it I have it connected I don't know what has to be done on their end no should be pluged in just bear with us I thought it was just plug and play something that I have to do here here no how can we hook it up again somewhere um H sure come yeah come on sister our our lovely humble secretary is going to fill in until uh we're going to fill in the time I I really don't know what I'm going to say but I just thought to while they're figuring that out um so this was a a fun trip because brother Wade was there and um just to give you like a there's a preview of it we flew in Sunday by Monday the plan was just for him to preach that evening but of course as we're driving from the air airport we get a call and said oh we heard your Pastors in town we have somebody that wants to get baptized so then the plan was okay first thing in the morning we're going to find someplace to get baptized so we drove and out we didn't know who this person was we didn't know where we were going originally it was a man it was a man it was a friend of a brother but they were just very adamant about we want him to be baptized so we drove an hour we got there and they said we don't know where he is up so you can just imagine what's going through brother Wade's mind when we were very afraid to break the news but it was great it worked out really good well wait a minute American walking to a field it wasn't his or anybody else's that was there but Eric said right here is a place we're going to do it so we did it and God God did a a work that little girl came to the whole service all whole weekend whole week anyway so that's it we'll start out here so this um this was like the day the day after we we we came back we we got there so December 16th and we were about an hour away from Brother Eric's house and we were supposed to baptize a certain man and uh we were just happy ready to go baptize him rriv away and then we get there and the man's gone there nowhere to be found so of course you know we're going back to Eric's house which is an hour back and but the people that we were driving with there they took us to the to the place there was a little girl there that wanted to get baptized and so she uh she uh she had she had taken her clothes and everything changing clothes and everything and nobody none of us knew that and so uh so um they told us and and she said she'd like to get baptized and so we stopped by this little creek right there on the side of the dirt road and we went ahead and and and baptized the little girl brother Wade baptized her and I was there interpreting right off the side of the bank and like you said the brother those people they just they might be fenc there they'll just knock it right down and just go on in there and um and so we were there this is the the the the family the little girl's family her grandparents right here on the right and uh he he he has a he's a he has some health issues um wonderful brother and uh but we were praying for him and his wife as well and uh after the the the baptism but um I don't if we wanted to add anything gab G Gabriella is her name darella darella all right and then we're still trespassing we're still trespassing we decid to eat and they they they they they took a cooler with with with things and then they had food for for for us so we had some fried chicken and uh and and some other things there yeah so they weren't just it wasn't just going to be a baptism and that's it they were very appreciative of what we took yeah we had a little bit of Fellowship there all right that night uh that same night we went back to our brother Eric's house got rested up a little bit got uh uh uh refreshed and then that night we had our first service at brother uh Lucas cardona's church and uh brother Wade spoke there wonderful brother and uh uh we had a really good time but this brother the brother at the pull pit there at the the ppit that's the pastor brother Lucas and then uh brother margarito aosta was there uh and he's another brother uh he's the he's the father of one of the brothers from Honduras Brother Ali that we support there in Honduras there his that's his dad and Cindy yeah sister Cindy that's who oh yes sister Cindy I don't know if you all know that's that's the that came here when we baptized her and she got married here as well well uh little little quick wedding that's the brother that's talked to her over the phone about about the Lord and then he asked me if we could get reach out to her and she came and got baptized and everything a lot of you don't know about that cuz it was kind of done on a Saturday before a youth service started but so but that's that's that night all right so on the next day December 17th is when we were heading to where the ministers meetings were going to be held at it's usually a two to three-day meeting where where ministers uh brother Aaron's been there and but ministers held meetings during the morning there's two sessions for them one in the morning and one in the afternoon and then later that evening it's a general meeting under a tent for everyone and so everybody can can be there and everybody everybody's there at the service so we drove about four hours from talanga for from where we were where brother Eric is from to uh chuta or near chuta which an area called elor and uh that's where we were at so the road the roads are great I've been in I've been in Jamaica 11 times in it's it's one big dirt road but they had really good roads so it was it was pretty good on the old man okay yeah not to have to hit some p and um there was there's not just Honduran brothers that go to these meetings but there's also brothers from El Salvador that was there if you can see there El Salvador from Nicaragua uh they go to these ministers meeting which they hold every two months and Panama and also Panama there was Brothers there from Panama as well so uh it was about 150 pastors or ministers there just just the ministers that that doesn't count their churches and people I mean there's whole churches in buses just going in you know so there was a I'd say I'd say about 900 something people Al together they're Comm meting um this is us uh I don't know if this video will play but this is us going through the capital of Honduras this is teus galpa um traffic I'm sure brother Don and them theyve been through there before they're not from this area they're actually from up North nor than F further away from this area but you know you need to go around the the the country you you usually have to pass through the capital all right lot of traffic all right and so we uh they we rented this little this little van that a brother provided for us which was brother Lucas's son and we just helped pay for it and uh we had some issues with this van the Christmas lights were on on the dashboard you know this we thought they were like Christmas lights it was around Christmas time so they were blinking you know flashing you can say something you guys see I took a picture of Robert there so obviously they don't have car seats so he's sitting on the floor and he's using the seat for from the coloring books and all the crayons that sister Jun sent him so he he was pretty much like that the whole ride yeah when they come here didn't hear from him when they when they come here they just think it's so strange that you have to be restrained on a car seat they don't they don't see that they think it's weird yeah and so it's hard for them to get adjusted to car seats and things like that but uh there they they don't ride like that so all right this is a place where we uh uh where we took a little break before get to El Tambor now this is Brother Eric's parents this is Brother joavan on the left and then sister Nidia on the right and uh just they're just wonderful people amen amen they uh we just consider them part of our family they've always opened their doors to us and uh yeah brother Aaron knows them as well and they're just they're just lovely people Amen brother brother brother Eric's dad he's a he's a deacon in his church brother Eric's Church he's also the mechanic Church he's a Brother Don I'm telling you we had problems with this van several times I can't remember what the issue was brother Wade bu pick one but every time brother joavan would just come we'd just get Brother joavan Hey brother joavan he would just walk up to the vehicle and the vehicle would start he wouldn't even touch it he wouldn't even he just looks at it he never touch anything he opened the hood up and said okay party fine it's like the vehicles they're scared of him they don't want him touching anything of their parts so he says okay we're good yeah the vehicle Christine said that the the vehicle just says I'm joking I'm just joking just a little hi all right so um this is where we're heading towards the campsite it's up a little Hill but uh in this is the area called elor and uh that's brother joavan in the front of us and that's us right there Christine taking the video now in this in this area right here they would bring a lot of uh a lot of uh uh sugar can from the top of the hill so it was a big business there I don't believe they do that anymore but I remember going going to this Parts since since 20 uh I started first going here in around 2017 and I remember on these roads you would go there and the whole place would just smell like sugar sugar cane oh wow it was it was a it was a lovely it was like a mixture of of of of n nature with sugar cane yeah and they they don't smell like that anymore because they haven't it hasn't been um they haven't been working with the sugar cane anymore but that's us going up to the campsite and I believe this is the same video now this is Brother uh uh Robert's Church uh there in elor and uh this is just little fence a fence they have out there which is pretty nice um yes when we first started going there it did not look like that back in 2017 so they' progressively worked on this church uh little by little um I don't know if yall remember but a couple of couple of uh uh two years ago maybe I testified that this was the brother who was having an issue with a a man who wanted to kill him yeah this is the church this is the brother yeah and uh all that's been taken care of but brother brother Robert was put there he he he knows that it's of God but he it hasn't been easy for him he's have he's had to deal with drunk people coming in and and threatening his life uh a man who has a a man who has a bar uh next to his church uh who who who thought that brother Robert was in It On in It with with the local government to try to shut down his bar and everything and brother Robert wasn't trying to do that um he came to brother Robert threatening his life uh last just last year yep and of course he was drunk he actually he was high on something and uh when he came to himself he apologized to brother Robert and said I'm so sorry I acted that way and so so brother Roberts had had to deal with a lot of things like that but he still maintains firm and the people he has some really good people that are helping him out helping him there some good brothers so uh this is us bringing more chairs Under the Tent for that evening general service mhm so those chairs that you guys see like some people actually have that as a business they rent those out and so there would be a point where they need more chairs so they'd have to go around and the different places where they know and they'll say hey can we rent more chairs and so you see them they ENT the church out too yeah and then they still wouldn't be enough because you'd see a bunch of people just outside the tent they mostly would just eventually give the seats to the mothers and the children and the Remain the brothers would just be around the tent and the last service brother Wade asked everybody to go under the tent but there was there was just no room but there was just so many people outside the tent we all just had to squeeze in under there yeah and and there's there's no hotels nearby or anything like that for the all these ministers pastors coming from different countries for them to go and oh we're going to go to a nice hotel a holiday in no no they're all sleeping they have these little Cs and they put all line up all these CS inside the church inside the sanctuary and when the sanctuary isn't being used and that's where the majority sleep and these are pastors you know small and U but that's what they've gotten used to do you know and so they're really uh and families families nearby in their houses they would hold three or four families you know they find a way it to just fit everybody in there mhm so this is Brother Wade everyone wanted to meet brother Wade also known asmano Samuel had a hard time with my name cuz they could not say his name they could not say brother Wade and so uh they just say we just tell them just call him brother Wade I mean brother Samuel yeah and so majority of them that's what they call him that my name is actually close to a name was not very good yes so they quit calling me that probably why they don't want yeah it's like a donkey or something look it up q e y I think you I I I may explain to you later on in a private session private conversation well because they're dies so I'd be brother W so I said hey Samuel's good most of y'all are Nam Samuel anyway so just call me mhm so uh this was the first night of the meetings umad actually one service the pastor couldn't um introduce me he had um Eric to do it because he was afraid he'd say the wrong name that other name so brother Eric did it yeah brother Robert he's he just came to me and said hey can I just call him Samuel brother Samuel I said sure I mean that's his name name yeah we just know him here by Brother Wade um so that yes this night I I was the for opening night and I I ministered that night and uh we had a really wonderful service we did amen and uh so now the second day of the meetings this was me and brother Wade brother Wade uh Samuel brother Samuel sorry brother Samuel there was about 150 ministers there and uh brother Wade I don't know if you want to kind of just go over a little bit of what you mentioned well we was just talking about the when Jesus Took the when brother BR said it was the greatest anointing there was when Jesus Took the book sat down and opened the book the book was closed we spoke on it here the book was closed given to Jesus he opened it read identified himself closed it and give it back to him I just typed it all the way through the message so MH and one time I paused and the Lord got a hold of Louise and he finished my whole s he finished about two sentences that I was going to say and I stopped cuz I was going to pause and let him and he just said what I was going to say praise the Lord I just looked over him and you know he just kept going that's exactly what I was going to say so you get caught up in that's good I I I I get I get caught up with it because obviously you know it's a word that we love right amen and and God by God's grace you know he's been able to reveal that to us but I know that the people needed that as well and so I'm going to give everything that I have you know to it that's right and uh and they really my they were there just they were en really enjoyed it those I thought they was going to come because when he got to the point he got to a point talking about uh typing the seven Church ages with with with uh David's Seven Brothers you know uh and that they never had seen that typee before like that and and just different things like that any they just really really rejoiced so so wild brother way and so these are all the brothers the sisters weren't allowed inside in there so we were outside cooking just behind where they are so we can hear them so we're cooking back there and we would just hear everybody just roaring yeah and we were like oh something's happening in there yeah there they are yeah this is this is a a front Church actually yeah right yes that's brother Robert's Church add something in there sure so when um actually they thought brother Wade went too short they wanted they were saying we're not done with we're not done with with lunch but so I knew that it was hot in there it's super hot in that church so when I heard that they were finishing so I go and meet brother Wade and you can just see he was just pale I don't know if you remember he was just pale and he said I need some a tall something of caffeine like he just he was just you could see his energy was just he was gone he was ready to just drop so I'm like okay just sit down because and and it made sense because there was just so much going on inside of there there was just so much virtue you know people really pulled and you could really see that he was just like I need to sit down but I need something so that was that was something they made coffee in the biggest walk I ever seen in my life Aaron you seen it B you seen it you walk out there and want some coffee and they're like Arline it's this big around and that deep and it's all coffee under an open open fire absolutely under an open fire and now like you want some coffee yeah he's like said I hope the cats hadn't been in there I didn't care at that point in time though but those sisters from the day they begin that meeting till the day they leave they fix food for 800 people 00 people per service three times three times a day three times a day I'm not talking about one me I'm talking about three times a day but these are sisters from different countries so you see um from El Salvador from Nicaragua so they're from this different churches and really I guess they're just so used to just okay we're going to do this and everybody just does something and there's a lot of them that that had done that so it it's really a really group effort I mean the first night you got a lot of chickens running around the second night there's not as many third night crickets no I mean listen they fed us you see that big old thing right there an yeah yeah that's a that's a paddle that's what they stiring that but we went outside and admonished his sisters and prayed with them cuz that's a it's a it's an ordeal I mean a big time ordeal I don't know if you anything else oh um most of the time brother Wade would ask for for Mountain Dew and I'd be like no or he would want like a soda and like no that's not good for you but that one day I took my mother with me that I was respons ible for two people so so but that one after that service where you see his face he was just pale I'm like I'm going to get you soda yeah she did you need soda thank you big sod probably some of the sweetest people you'll ever see in your life even I even from the people at the airport um drivers people that weren't Christians they were just I mean you go go to other places you know Jamaica 11 times the Phil even the Philippines if you're not if they don't know you they'll walk right past you but these people just so jovial and and and happy and I appreciate that yes so that was the uh the after the morning service brother Wade made sure to greet the sisters and that that's good that's good you i' I've been to places where some of the brothers they go and they just they just want to go back to the hotel you know I think it they want to be with the people you know and I I I want to be with the people I want to be with because that's where you can there's certain other type of ministry that you can do like that right that you can't do from the pulpit right on a personal level you know and I know brother Aaron was he he he he he wanted to be with the people as well when we went and so I believe that's very important amen and I think it made a huge impact that right after service brother Wade was right there with with the sisters because the sisters were like they were saying to me the food's not ready why is he here I'm like no it's okay he just wants to say hi you know yeah they they thought he was just like I want to eat now you know but it wasn't that he just wanted to I mean you know how brother way is I just want to be around say hello to people I want to see how they could fix for that many people so three meals and I mean they were good meals too they weren't just potato chips and crackers right no I I said them chickens they running for their life all right let's continue here this is a where we where we had car trouble in one of the places where we had stalled and right next to the road and there these trucks just passing right by me there was there was nothing that you can I mean we had to sit there and try to work on the vehicle with uh I didn't know what I was doing good thing we had brother Allan there with us uh from Nicaragua but they just big old 18 wheel just zooming right next to you blow the car over I told Louise one time I said get in this car stand up there so that that morning was the ministers meeting but it's only for the local ministers the second part was yes that morning so we were going back we had we took the opportunity that morning to visit um a little boy a baby yes so we'll we'll show a picture we're on our way to that but getting to that baby seemed to be imp possible yes so and so we kept having the car trouble with this vehicle because uh brother javani came he got it going but then when we got to the place near the house where the baby was at uh we had trouble with it again it was a diesel and I Donnie can correct me but I smell diesel fuel the whole time get a headache like you wouldn't believe but if you have a small leak in a diesel motor doesn't it won't it lose its pressure and then shut down mhm cuz there's no there's no there's no electric pump like you have in a gas motor that keeps them keeps the fuel coming um and um diesel it it's from suction and I could smell it so it had a little little areas that what it just wasn't right and then we get out and start pushing Manpower they went out and started P yeah I said I'm whipped guys there was a a man out there just a random man by Hey Brother wait have worked hard you know he did and this was outside of a Wendy's and he was okay because there was I didn't put the video in but they were pushing they were pushing it but brother raade was okay cuz we finally got him a frosty yes I did and so yeah had to go to H that's me pushing we had to get that thing out of the way the people wanted the drive-thru we were we were in the parking lot we were well have everything so and thank the Lord it wasn't extremely hot it was pretty hot but it wasn't extremely hot like in Jamaica it I think it was in that video where brother re was just happy with the frosty this is the baby Dylan So what had happened was his they wanted us to come and pray for yes because the home it's a very sad story yeah um um do you want to go ahead and say it the the his dad um who was there pushing helping us with the vehicle he he we were going to meet him at the Wendy so that he could take us to the house where the baby was at and so when he came he helped us with the vehicle got it started and everything but what happened with what happened is that in DEC was it last in December of 2020 November November November was it last year oh it was one year before well they were about a year married and he had waited a long time he was 40 35 something like that found his love of his life and got and she got pregnant and then now she got pregnant and uh she got sick and the Lord took her while she was pregnant she it was also they had to deliver the baby a medical Mal Mal practice in the hospital where they were at she didn't make it but the baby survived yeah so it was very bittersweet she was very young too 23 years old 23 yeah so we went to their home to give them some comfort and the mother was just devastated and the sister too yeah and the father that's the father right there holding his brother Jimmy right there his name is Jimmy I mean he waited till he got 35 to get married and then well Lord's Lord it was Lord doing it what yeah whatever it is he'll know it that's that's what I told him I said whatever it is the Lord the Lord will reveal it to you abely but you did get a baby out of it beautiful kid so that's the mother of the of the of the girl his wife that passed away right there in the red and so we left him prayer cloths left some prayer cloths uh gave him a little little bit of money she was a seamstress and oh primitive like you wouldn't ever believe but she she was a seamstress in the community and so um she's taking it very hard because that's her youngest one of her her I as her child you know I passed away so young 23 years old you know had everything going for them and and uh and then their life just her life just gets snubbed away like that and so but uh we're still keep in touch I keep in touch with brother Jimmy always and he always sends me pictures of a little baby he's growing he's so cute and and we're just always praying for so if you remember brother Jimmy and the little baby little Dylan just remember them in your prayers remember the family A Long issue a breathing issue yeah he's needing a nebulizer but as far as we haven't heard back about if it's gotten worse so we give him some money for that for Navy l no no okay we talked about oh we talked okay okay okay okay then sounds good yeah that's awesome thank you sister okay so this is uh uh this is Brother Ayah Costa uh right here on the left he's one of the brothers he's an evangelist brother that we help support here in the church on a monthly basis and this is Brother Allan right here on the left the uh he we also help him on a monthly basis as well and so um uh brother Allen traveled by bus from Nicaragua yeah can Allan he's a big guy and the girls love him because they love traveling with him because when the girls don't want to eat their food and I always tell them you got to finish your food you know like don't you have to finish it even if you don't like it finish it you're going to get hungry later so what they'll do is they'll nudge brother Allan and be like brother Allan do you want some and they'll just give everything to him and he's more than happy to to take it look like it happened often brother Allan would already eaten his meal maybe his kids meals and then we ask him hey do you want to finish this one sure yeah sure but he he's a a really awesome brother yeah we were with him at one trip I don't remember where in the mountains and we found out that a dog bit him on the leg and he's like oh yeah it's okay and then as the day as the days went on apparently it was getting worse and he was just preaching kept on preaching till he went back home and said yeah I got to go to the doctor and get this checked out but they're they're really rugged Brothers the brother Eli and brother Allan they go down to the jungles of Honduras and Nicaragua uh they preach there and so they're just very very rugged um brother Bob knows brother Allen and uh so that's why I felt that you know that uh that's they're they're just missionaries locally to the area and so I'm glad that we we can help support it just pray for them because they're desire they're young but they have good strong desire to Amen to spread the the word this message they love this message absolutely kid all right so this was the last night of the ministers meeting there were approximately 800 Believers under that tent and brother Wade just he didn't preach a fiery sermon like you know uh uh Andrew Glover style but he brought it down home and it was something that needed it that that was needed and he spoke about love and uh it was a wonderful atmosphere after the service it was but at the end of the service I kind of the day studying thought about having a prayer line but my word there was 800 people there so I just had them all gather as close as they could and they all just laid hands on each other and we just had a about a 15minute prayer service and people got delivered people got healed it went good good yeah you don't have to have a prayer line every time you have a service but yes so we still get messages about that service yeah about that sermon how simple it was but yet it was it was very needed um you know I'll say this you know a a lot of the a lot of the ministry there in these countries you know they it's almost like U it's almost like that it's a it's a it's kind of like a macho type Ty type Spirit you know like you know and so they really preach a lot against the women and how they should dress and a lot of clothline type of things so when you bring things that are a little different from that what the message really is about I mean hairess and all that stuff the brother before that the story I had already had this sermon I was going to preach it so that was not I didn't change it right yeah but the brother that spoke before they was a sister there 800 people under that tent and about where maybe where brother uh and sister sitting back here um brother M there was a sister comes in and she's got like fishing lure earrings I mean they were hanging down and very wide and they you know anyway she was a visitor she come visiting had on pair of pants well that poor preacher sent her to Hell brought her back out sent her back again the whole time he preached on the not the whole time but so that next night buddy I let him have it with love but I did it with [Applause] love I asked him I told him I looked at him and I looked right down the preacher was sitting right there and I told him I said how long did it take you to accept this message of course the whole place is dead silence I said see there some of y'all are thinking in your mind months years I said so there's not one person going to get it at one night right so let's love them and not and and and it's not that everybody is like that it's not it's just that some of them they get I guess a little bit carried away in in that because that's the easy part of the of of this of the message yeah preaching against people and about how they dress and about how they look that's easy you know but when you start breaking down the word that's what they need and she did not come back to Second the night I she wasn't I was hoping she'd come back but so she wasn't there so anyways but that was the last night and uh we had a really really good time in the Lord and Brethren really appreciate they they came up that they uh brought the people that helped in the camp there and uh from different churches who helped out and they they uh acknowledged them uh and thank them for their service during those those days of the camp all right those sisters didn't perspire they sweat to fix that food for them I mean they stood over a fire for hours cooking so yeah all right and then um uh we went to Brother Eric's church this is Brother Eric's church and we preached there on that Sunday I believe it was Friday on Friday night okay and then uh we ministered there had a wonderful time um I don't know if I'm missing something about that service but brother got a really nice church for sweet people so that's that's the church there now we after uh the next day we went up and had some fellowship at up in in another area about an hour away from where brother Eric lives and this is Brother Melo brother Melo he is U he he's he's a very well-known Pastor there in Honduras and but he's sick he has uh he has Alzheimer's or dementia and so uh you just pray for him um uh the actually during this time he was act actually a little better because they've been trying to work with him on that yeah on a natural basis and so didn't he have one of the first churches or the biggest church he had he had the biggest church in Honduras okay and and so so it just you know it kind of his his his it just kind of reminds me of what we went through here with then that's what that church there is going through right now yeah and so uh he might be small but he packed a punch I tell you that wonderful brother all right and then then we had some fellowship at some brothers uh brother Maul's house uh there in Honduras there were some brothers uh from Nicaragua they were there as well brother Manuel who's a pastor who's the one sitting there in the uh seat and he was there waiting for us uh brother Bob knows brother Manuel and then uh this is uh we stayed that last night before we left um uh to come back home we stayed there at brother Milo's house brother MCO is the son of the brother who I just told you who was who's sick the pastor who who who was sick um and so that's his family right there so this was us getting ready to go to the Ser to the church that morning and uh the last service this is 3 hours before flying back home so brother wait this church is huge it's like a compound we park on the we park on the the street that goes down we parked there they had to be six stories that church is six stories there's different levels there's a level here for people to have musicians and practice and then they had a place where the sanctuary used to be and it's huge they don't use it anymore you're going up a little higher to Sunday School classes you're going up a little higher that then you go up a little higher and there's a balcony on the top well they told me they said when we leave we're going out the back door I just went up eight flights of stairs how we going to get out the back door without going back down it was built on on a hill so when we walked the back door we were right in the street but that's how steep that thing was and they built it you know like in layers all the way up and it it's a big church it's almost a type of place that you think a helicopter is going to come the helipad at the top and just go pick you up you know and take you that's kind of like I told Lise when we were sitting in a pastor study I said I hope you know how to get out of here we went through like eight different doors two flights of stairs just to get in the sanctuary but it so y'all pray for this church because they've been having some issues with their pastor's not there CU they're pastor and so what's been happening is some of the ministry within the congregation they've uh they're getting into believe the sign type stuff yeah um not believing the message not saying that you know brother bram's not a prophet and just things like that and so there's like an internal struggle within the church and so just remember that church in prayer all right so this was the the the just real quick uh brother Dale's last missionary support on the left was what what what the little kitchen that brother Robert was requesting that they upgrade because he knew two years later this they're going to have these meetings there yeah and so they wanted to give the best that they could but just to add the the before picture of the kitchen they held the same meeting with that kitchen yes s years before that the first time we went there they had the same meeting and that's what they used that's that's the kitchen that's all the that's all she had and so on the right you see the blue thing back there it's what they call a Pila and that's where they have all the water so that helped out a lot having that water there because before we would constantly have to ask the brothers to like bring us more water bring us more water so that was very helpful so on the right there where you see the Pila the blue box that was added on and you see where the black tarp is is that's where the kitchen is so that's where we were cooking and so they were able to expand that in the back there was 20 gallons in that pot with a coffee at least yeah at least so they that the place was expanded and that was one of the requests that brother Robert had asked and uh it was it was made possible and and that's the sister's personal kitchen because she lives behind the church yeah brother brother Robert was also asking if that we could he could have a pastor's study because the study was his his his bedroom the church church connected was connected to his house so he would come from his bedroom and go in and straight to the pulpit you know and so he wanted to have a little place you know for like a minister study as well um so that not everybody's going to his bedroom you know so so we I brought the need meet up and this is what those funds went to help as well and they have a little nice study right next to to the to the entrance to the pulpit of of the of the church there um and also a little uh some bathrooms were added uh as well four bathrooms were added one of them had had a shower included prior to this brother Robert shared his home bathroom with his congre with 800 people well they and everybody would would like just go different places different houses around locally and and uh and so uh Zoe had an experience with that Christine can tell she can tell about it we knocked at a random person's house that was back in 2018 Zoe was 6 years old yeah but they were just like brother Wade said it didn't matter who you were they were going to let they were letting us in right so so those bathrooms weren't there now they have a good a good place to go I mean a lot of people you have to go to the bathroom so right so I I do want to add that you know there were at least 800 people so if you see in the corner there where you see the little cushions it's just right outside that bathroom so people were sleeping there people were sleeping right there that's because they just any space that you can find and you can put a little cushion then that's where you're sleeping that night and on the side there when the window that's where brother Robert is that's their house yeah yeah yeah so that's what that the last thing that that that U dad had any dealings with was to give them support for that so yes so we wanted to be there and support dad and um and so I'm glad that we were able to do that um and I appreciate brother Wade's willingness to to have gone I appreciate your prayers and uh remember us in April that we're going to be there in uh again to uh attend a youth camp uh brother Eric's annual Youth Camp and Lord willing will will be there for about a week or so and God bless you all thank you so much for all your prayers yeah because you know funds can can can do they can do a lot but prayers do more yeah absolutely prayers do more because prayers changes things and it does the impossible whereas money you know it just targets one thing prayers does a lot of different things so please continue to pray for us that uh that the Lord just continue to bless those people that God you see the prayers the prayers go out to the different families money maybe not get to somebody's family but prayers do get there so just pray for the people in Honduras and we we've got several in our congregation from Honduras and uh we sure appreciate them and they're just wonderful people and the most surprised I ever was is that I'm talking about when it was in the morning it was 65 degre and it wasn't a lot of humidity now you go to Jamaica the only difference in the summer and the winter is what wind blows and the wind don't it's 90 90 in January 90 in July so that's the tropical weather but their weather was was really nice and we sure uh we sure had a good time we appreciate all of you all your support um let's stand our feet um also we had decided when we got there since um they're having meetings again later on is we are going to uh put brother Robert an air conditioner in his church so yeah praise the Lord you should have been in that thing with 120 something preachers and nothing they was a window of fan I think they had a fan behind us that was about it and then some saing fans that was just blowing hot air so uh we going to uh give them some funds to uh to put an air conditioner in and uh you see how we are we're we're Americans but but that's okay we have our place we're fine I'm glad God sent us a prophet from America so that we could get the a lot more benefit than them because we get it in our language but now we can take whatever we can get as a prosperous nation and we can give it to people like that and their brothers and sisters it's not just is helping the poor is helping is helping the Brothers and Sisters in Christ because they didn't they didn't um have anything to do with being born over there but they got the same message we do they got the same Holy Ghost we do and they were there they were there talking and and I was enjoying it cuz you could whether I didn't whether I didn't understand them or not you could feel the spirit behind it you can feel the spirit behind them those people that the passion that they have and the ministers did for for hearing more of the word of God and um we appreciate having the time to do that we appreciate all of you staying and we apologize it took a little bit longer but you didn't go to sleep so that's good so and it's only it's only 12:23 old time but your stomach I'm sure is telling you it's 123 so all mine's clear we're anybody need prayer uh we appreciate brother Lise uh I'm telling you he's rock star over there yeah isn't he yeah he's a rock star over there he is here too he is here too but he's a rock star over there and I mean the solid rock not that kind of rock I'm talking about the solid rock but but it's a passion he has and I appreciate that and then he can communicate with them where I have to wait let somebody say something and then you know Get Lost in Translation but thank God that we have brothers and sisters even um we got brother Manuel back here now uh interpreting he's in the in the room and glad him and sister Emma decided to park it out here we sure appreciate that I prayed to God to give us another interpreter I did I prayed that they give us another interpreter that he would give us another interpreter to take a lot off off of brother Lise and they showed up but they came out here to be with us and we sure do appreciate all of them that um that can interpret and and and like brother Lis I just one more thing when I was there with those ministers and and he was I probably should have stopped and let him let him preach but he was if you see the U I would back up and he'd make a point and and I made a point one time like I said and I backed up and when I did he interpreted the point that I was making and said about four more things after that and I Ain got to it so that you know he was getting caught up in the in the in the word of God and they really enjoyed it and U like again like I said again thank you all for supporting I'm glad and listen from the bottom of my heart even though it was my father we are so fortunate in this church I'm telling you folks there's there's churches and and there's nothing wrong with it brother brandham said the tithe goes to the ministry goes to the pastor okay whatever he does with us his business but Dad never did that he took a salary and he put the rest in a pile and that's what we used out of that pile was um the amount of money that we send overseas and for the different ones a lot of churches if brother Luis was going to other small churches he'd have to pay for everything we try to support him as much as we can and all of you that go somewhere at least pay in your your airplane Bill and and give you an offering to take over there but a lot of churches can't do that but we can and I pray and it comes from you guys I'm like like brother um Joe Green said he said now we've got all these needs are met he says at camp meeting there's like $400,000 worth of needs at camp meeting he said we got every bit of it he said it's in your pocket don't think about that so um we love you with the love of the Lord thanks so much thank you for your support again let's bow our heads dear heavenly father thank you Lord number one that you give us a group of people that's so giving Lord and they
