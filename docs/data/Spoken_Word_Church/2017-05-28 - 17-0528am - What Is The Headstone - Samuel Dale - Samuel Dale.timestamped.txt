[5:00] amen amen
[5:01] did you see everybody in the house of
[5:03] the Lord if you'd like to turn in your
[5:05] scriptures turn to acts 4 1st Peter - I
[5:10] think these are the ones we use last
[5:12] Sunday we want to stay with that and
[5:15] carry that all over
[5:17] remember the announcements we know
[5:23] tomorrow is Memorial Day and we thank
[5:26] God for the fact that we can have our
[5:28] freedom until this time and a lot of
[5:31] people gave their lives so that we could
[5:34] be able to keep that freedom on and it's
[5:38] fast going away but yet their their
[5:41] lives sustained for a long time the
[5:43] ability of you and I to be free and we
[5:46] really thank God for those thing I
[5:49] remember Aaron will be preaching for Ash
[5:51] Wednesday I had to chase him down he was
[5:53] up in North Carolina somewhere to let
[5:56] him know he had to preach but you're
[5:58] doing and there was somebody he told me
[6:00] through there Jean Williams
[6:05] Jean Martin had passed away and I don't
[6:08] know what he's going that away or what
[6:10] but he's from up in the Hickory North
[6:13] Carolina area and all of brother Martin
[6:16] so remember the family there all right
[6:18] now the Bible study will be this coming
[6:20] Saturday 6 o'clock brother Prakash will
[6:24] be with us on Sunday to minister unto us
[6:28] the Lord willing brother Daugherty has
[6:31] been to the doctor and they have
[6:33] diagnosed him with stage 2 cancer of the
[6:38] prostate but yet you know we're still
[6:42] praying they're going to tell him
[6:44] Thursday kind of the procedure of what
[6:47] to do it not like that but we just pray
[6:50] and believe that it'll be all right
[6:52] we're not sure we thank God for the
[6:54] healing and no matter how it would come
[6:57] and what science would use to bring it
[7:00] to pace that's fine too
[7:02] we thank God for his healing because
[7:04] shines cannot heal us they can't take
[7:06] care of it so if God wants to use any
[7:09] way fine he wants to deliver it that's
[7:11] fine we believe in a delivery factor
[7:14] right because that's what we're supposed
[7:16] to believe okay all right remember those
[7:19] as anything else
[7:22] I think that's all of the announcements
[7:25] on anyhow but Acts for in first Peter -
[7:29] Lord Jesus we thank you for this day and
[7:32] thank you for an opportunity to be able
[7:35] to come together into worship you we
[7:39] thank you for all of those that have
[7:41] given their lives and things that we can
[7:43] be able to be free at this time of life
[7:46] to where we can worship you and not be
[7:49] under the problems and things of
[7:51] dictatorships and all kind of things
[7:53] that we can worship and freedom and love
[7:56] for you and we thank you for all of
[7:58] those who gave their lives for us to be
[8:01] able to have it and we pray that you
[8:03] would Lord then be with all of the
[8:05] families and everyone to loved ones
[8:07] who've lost them and the ones that were
[8:09] wounded in different things that are
[8:11] happening and we pray that you just
[8:13] bless each one have you away with us
[8:15] today and Lord forgive our sins leaders
[8:18] by that understanding we commit all to
[8:21] you in Jesus name Amen
[8:26] x4 verse 9 if we just Dave the examined
[8:38] of the good deed done to this impotent
[8:40] man by what means he is made whole be it
[8:45] known unto you all and to all the people
[8:48] of Israel that by the name of Jesus
[8:51] Christ of Nazareth whom you crucified
[8:53] whom God raised up from the dead even by
[8:57] him that this man stand here before you
[8:59] hold now who is he this is the stone
[9:02] which was set at nought of you builders
[9:05] which is become the head of the corner
[9:10] and once neither is there salvation in
[9:13] any other
[9:15] there is none other name under heaven
[9:16] given among men whereby we must be saved
[9:23] first Peter two six and eight wherefore
[9:28] also is contained in the scripture
[9:29] behold I lay in Zion the chief
[9:31] Cornerstone elect precious and he that
[9:34] believeth on him shall not be confounded
[9:36] under you therefore which believe is
[9:39] precious but under them which be
[9:42] disobedient the stone which the builders
[9:44] just allowed the same has made the head
[9:47] of the corner and a stone of stumbling
[9:49] and a rock of offense even to them which
[9:52] stumble at the word the one so you've
[9:57] got to tie together and make sure you
[9:58] get the person and the word to be the
[10:00] same so there's not you're going to
[10:02] having turn him down just a person but
[10:05] now the emphasis is laid upon what they
[10:07] stumbled at the word being disobedient
[10:10] wording to they were appointed you may
[10:13] be seated the Lord that is blessing to
[10:16] the reading of the word now tried a
[10:20] couple of messages trying to get
[10:23] everything in line and I hope we can
[10:25] finish this this morning kind of on
[10:29] these things but I want to make sure we
[10:32] keep the point like I said we know when
[10:36] we've been through that the Old
[10:37] Testament spoke of a coming stone a
[10:40] messiah the whole Old Testament was
[10:44] prophecy of the coming of the Lord Jesus
[10:46] and he came exactly the way the Bible
[10:51] said he would come but mankind had he
[10:54] had it all figured out in their ways and
[10:57] their thoughts of you know their
[11:01] concepts of how it was to be they were
[11:04] looking for the Messiah but what about
[11:07] now even like a prophet would say you
[11:09] know and they were there singing the
[11:11] hymns right there as they were out there
[11:14] crucifying him and those very hymns they
[11:18] were singing was talking about they
[11:20] pierced my hands and my feet the things
[11:22] how blind can we be if you
[11:28] ask them was there a god oh yes I like
[11:31] the way the Prophet emphasizes saying he
[11:33] said Eve never doubted that God was real
[11:36] he said it was just his word then he
[11:40] wouldn't keep it which he believed that
[11:43] Israel was looking for the coming
[11:45] Messiah but mankind had interpreted to
[11:50] them what it was to be when he would
[11:54] come
[11:55] they had him as a warrior or deliver all
[11:58] kind of things you know and and they had
[12:02] put into the minds of the people until
[12:06] actually when when Jesus Christ came
[12:09] exactly according to the Scriptures they
[12:13] rejected him you said well some of the
[12:19] people believed in we they believed him
[12:22] but did they believe him enough to be
[12:24] able to continue on with him and that's
[12:29] been the thought that I've been trying
[12:30] to bring to us for a couple of services
[12:33] could we reject the corner the corner
[12:37] stone Curtis Nodine talking about a
[12:39] headstone until you get the stronger
[12:40] corner stone correctly and places in
[12:43] order there is no need is talking about
[12:45] we would reject a headstone with the on
[12:48] you know there's no need of even dealing
[12:50] with that until we get it in line but
[12:53] could we reject Jesus Christ claiming -
[12:57] believing now remember you say but but
[13:06] it's just accepting Jesus Christ as our
[13:08] Savior that's what I emphasized last
[13:12] week from Romans 10 and we need people
[13:17] have confessed with their mouth and
[13:20] believed in their heart that Jesus
[13:24] Christ died for them does that make them
[13:30] saved we said well yeah what else can
[13:32] you do that's true all of the Abraham
[13:38] could do was believe God but what did
[13:41] God due to Abraham he gave him the sign
[13:45] of circumcision right to prove his
[13:49] believing was correct what all we got to
[13:52] do is believe but we emphasize it over
[13:57] and over our Sunday at the end of the
[14:00] message you say I've accepted Jesus
[14:04] Christ as my savior that's wonderful but
[14:09] has he accepted you run well you're
[14:18] making it something that's you know
[14:21] beside the point for me what can I do
[14:23] about it
[14:25] you can make sure you're accepting him
[14:27] correctly you can make sure your
[14:31] understanding of accepting him is
[14:34] correct what we've done what Roman said
[14:39] okay why didn't God come to the fact of
[14:42] saving people there must be something
[14:47] wrong with the approach right it's just
[14:53] like I've always emphasized to you I
[14:55] don't believe everybody in the Old
[14:57] Testament they brought a lamb and laid
[15:00] it down and they killed it
[15:03] I don't believe every one of them went
[15:05] home free of their sin because it was
[15:09] just a act or a work or a thought it was
[15:14] not a sincerity of the heart and see God
[15:18] what about a God who ordained all of the
[15:21] offerings and the sin offerings and all
[15:24] thing but then one day he said my
[15:26] nostrils they're stinking of your
[15:30] sacrifices of your offerings he said I
[15:34] would just an honest in the contrite
[15:36] heart and I've always emphasized what
[15:40] about David
[15:41] it didn't matter about him being King
[15:44] because they didn't kill him for his
[15:47] action is doing I didn't have anything
[15:49] to do with it the high priests do
[15:51] something wrong they kill him
[15:55] but David always had a sincerity in his
[15:58] heart that no matter what he done he
[16:03] getting this fall back on a crutch oh
[16:05] Lord I couldn't help it now you know
[16:08] that that you just made me like this and
[16:12] I couldn't help being the way that I've
[16:15] been he didn't take that route that's
[16:19] not a sincere route he was apologetic he
[16:23] was crying out always searching
[16:26] returning to me and Scofield even
[16:30] verifies it Brennan says it David was on
[16:36] his way home from the bed of Bathsheba
[16:38] when he began to cry out Lord return
[16:40] unto me the joy of thy salvation
[16:45] so couldn't we today turn down the very
[16:53] opportunity whatever you want to call it
[17:00] to be a Christian by believing we
[17:04] already are well I've done everything
[17:08] God told me to do well don't you think
[17:12] the high priest could say that
[17:14] now come on remember what we emphasize
[17:16] it any word that Jesus ever said
[17:19] anything about the high priest and them
[17:22] of the things they were doing come on
[17:25] bring me the scripture he never got up
[17:30] the front accomplished accomplish your
[17:32] dirty dog you've seen you've done this
[17:34] not the other you never said it why
[17:39] because he didn't do it well he just
[17:44] didn't want to bring it out philosophies
[17:47] get you in trouble
[17:48] vain jangling gives you to worry exactly
[17:53] what I'm talking about
[17:55] they buy philosophies and vain jangling
[17:57] and ideas of mankind we can turn down
[18:00] the very word of God claiming to believe
[18:03] it
[18:04] look at those Pharisees where could he
[18:06] touch their lives
[18:07] of what
[18:08] were doing nobody he never told him is
[18:12] wrong why because they kept the law to
[18:19] the letter but he said you've rejected
[18:25] me and thereby be rejected me said the
[18:31] kingdom is going to be taken from you
[18:34] so they rejected him as the Messiah they
[18:39] also rejected him as their king he come
[18:43] riding in to them probably even calls it
[18:47] well not donkey that day the very king
[18:52] they were looking for and Pilate wound
[18:57] up being better than rest of them he did
[18:59] at least nail to sign up and said the
[19:01] king of Israel he must have thought more
[19:05] about it and understood it better than
[19:06] they did we had he come exactly
[19:09] according to the word but was rejected
[19:13] could we reject it again one of these
[19:20] days you'll realize why I make the
[19:22] statement constantly never stop seeking
[19:25] God no matter what you do never get to a
[19:31] state that you think when I Lord I've
[19:34] done enough in seeking you never get
[19:39] that foolish trying to get away from him
[19:44] words stupid sometimes
[19:46] I've been known to be kind of rough
[19:48] about that part a kind of life in this
[19:50] morning I said go brother
[19:52] lluís back there we got a email from
[19:55] India and Irish brother Louisa's name in
[19:58] there and brother Bob's in it wages in
[20:01] it you know
[20:01] talking more about the words and it was
[20:03] about she was and what I would bring
[20:06] yeah well I thank God for that that's
[20:09] what a tow brother Louie censored Ceaser
[20:11] if you hadn't come to Lulu your name
[20:12] wouldn't been on the internet going
[20:14] around her world you would have never
[20:16] been recognized as being all over so
[20:20] there is some good about coming to
[20:22] right but listen could we turn down the
[20:26] word it explained to me the difference
[20:31] in the situation of Israel of old and
[20:34] they're following the word to the letter
[20:36] and walking in the law then what you
[20:42] would say we have done well with a
[20:45] brother della
[20:46] I've done all they can do I accepted
[20:48] Jesus Christ as my savior and he'll
[20:50] tried to be a Christian all my life and
[20:51] I've done this I've done that I've done
[20:53] all these things well which one was
[20:58] justified the one standing it said Lord
[21:01] I've done all of these things or the one
[21:05] that said Lord just forgive me which
[21:08] went home justified well David was a
[21:15] shyster a crook or dirty God words or
[21:21] anything you could bring up about David
[21:23] to be good yet the Bible said he was a
[21:27] man after God's own heart you mean the
[21:34] dirty guy with the garden I mean that's
[21:36] the kind of God you're serving no no no
[21:38] no it's he had an honest in the country
[21:41] heart he had a forgiving attitude he was
[21:47] always crying out for forgiveness he'll
[21:49] never stop seeking God cuz my what is my
[21:52] statement has always been to you I'd
[21:54] rather go all of my life seeking after
[21:58] God you know every day crying out unto
[22:03] Him and get to that final day and come
[22:06] to find out I had it all along then did
[22:10] not seek after God and believe in my
[22:13] great philosophies of the great
[22:15] justification for reasons that I know my
[22:18] salvation is real and get down to the
[22:20] end of it and find out it wasn't real
[22:23] which one of you we seek to reject him
[22:30] then was to reject now listen dear woman
[22:34] try to pick up
[22:35] the point one to reject Jesus Christ as
[22:39] the Messiah as the king and all the Old
[22:42] Testament speaking to reject him as
[22:44] being though saying you realize you are
[22:48] rejecting the unto our Old Testament and
[22:56] what did your prophet say he said word
[23:00] rejecters
[23:01] what word rejecters he said goes to hell
[23:12] then we can try to appease God or
[23:18] whatever by saying what Lord we didn't
[23:21] know well that's a good excuse
[23:26] maybe a lot on that day that God will
[23:29] deal with at the watch on judgment of
[23:32] the Old Testament you or whatever
[23:34] wherever people are you'll be dealing
[23:36] with people that have that confession
[23:39] and a lot of it is right you know and
[23:42] what and a lot would be giving eternal
[23:44] life and all of the great goodie doodoos
[23:50] and you know the guys is always right
[23:52] everything is going to miss it because
[23:58] they rejected me yes but you don't
[24:05] understand from the tale I've accepted
[24:08] Jesus Christ as my savior and if he
[24:13] don't save me he's a liar be careful be
[24:21] careful now what's the issue you say but
[24:24] it's just to accept Jesus Christ then
[24:32] he's going to have to accept every
[24:33] religion there is
[24:41] every religious person or whatever you
[24:44] want to call it am i right no matter
[24:50] what you put it or what they do or all
[24:52] of the great rituals are doing but still
[24:54] all the religious world is saying Jesus
[24:58] Christ as their Savior am i right
[25:02] well why is he not accepting that and by
[25:10] what justification our signs or wonders
[25:13] are you going to put it on that's all
[25:19] I'm trying to ask you and I to to verify
[25:22] that after 50 years of studying this
[25:25] message brother Dale I don't look at
[25:33] those what do you want me to does I want
[25:39] you to keep on seeking God but Renison
[25:44] stay there until you're certain he has
[25:49] accepted you that was remember was in
[25:51] the last quotes we were giving it is not
[25:54] whether or not you accepted him it's
[26:00] whether he accepts you now as I said
[26:07] then if it's just upon accepting him
[26:09] because he said it and we can quote
[26:13] Romans 10 confess with your mouth and
[26:14] believe in your heart well then why is
[26:18] it that all religions all religious
[26:25] realm religious people why is it that
[26:29] everybody that says they're saved it or
[26:34] not let's don't go into philosophies we
[26:40] know there's people who make concessions
[26:42] and they're going on and they're going
[26:43] to be judged according to those like at
[26:45] the white throne right and some will be
[26:49] given eternal life now leave that out of
[26:51] it just get down to honest and
[26:53] straightness to think about it why is it
[26:57] that God does not accept all the
[27:01] religious world of this nut according to
[27:06] my Bible and according to the Prophet
[27:10] messenger that we try to believe it
[27:14] comes to a day that in the lady you see
[27:16] an age that he's put outside of the
[27:21] church right outside of the church
[27:29] that's inside the church singing about
[27:33] him right
[27:36] yes Patricia she's not that bad well
[27:39] well now according to the Bible now he's
[27:42] standing at the door knocking trying to
[27:44] get back in now that's according to the
[27:46] scriptures he said well it's really God
[27:49] is not there when you go ahead and argue
[27:50] with him all you want to that's what he
[27:53] put in his word what has been rejected
[27:59] by the religious world that would make
[28:04] him be on the outside knocking at the
[28:06] door trying to get back in not God is a
[28:12] savior
[28:13] right they want that and confess that
[28:17] not God is a healer or deliverer a
[28:21] comfort of whatever in a time of need
[28:25] what is it that had that the religious
[28:27] world has turned down that would put him
[28:30] at outside the door knocking that's a
[28:36] simple question all I asked everybody
[28:40] said brother they are so deep is that
[28:42] tea and that's really something it's so
[28:44] deep I just asked a simple question yes
[28:47] would you confuse this card we don't
[28:48] know what you tell me
[28:49] I just said what I'm talking about how
[28:58] come your prophet would start out in an
[28:59] early ministry preaching to 500,000
[29:03] lined up in his life ministry preaching
[29:06] to a dozen
[29:15] he was just stubborn he just he had all
[29:19] them invitations to go we've listened to
[29:23] him last night he said had thousands of
[29:26] invitations laying back there people
[29:31] inviting him for a we are not just one
[29:33] day he said for two weeks and for this
[29:35] that in the other but did they really
[29:39] want him for the words that he was
[29:41] bringing or did they want him for the
[29:42] gifts that would be innate manifest they
[29:44] would draw the crowds and bring the
[29:46] money which one is it he said we'll pray
[29:54] to see where God sends us you know where
[29:58] God was going to send him the place the
[30:02] door wasn't closed is that plain enough
[30:05] he went to a lot of places the doors
[30:08] were already closed will you agree with
[30:10] that because they certainly didn't open
[30:14] the doors and invite him in for the word
[30:16] and he was ran what did the prophets say
[30:20] about Jesus he said oh they loved him
[30:23] because it he was a healer he was a
[30:25] feeder of the people who's doing it but
[30:27] said when he begin to say I and my
[30:29] father won he said then they turned away
[30:32] from him in other words when he begin to
[30:36] say I am the fulfillment of the Old
[30:38] Testament Scriptures was that what he
[30:41] was saying I am the one that has come
[30:45] according to the word Regis Thomas and
[30:49] Rita it is if we go through it that he
[30:51] he talked about the stone which is don't
[30:53] you know there's a he talked about the
[30:57] bread in the wilderness and did he say
[30:59] I'm that bread all the Old Testament was
[31:02] fulfilled in Jesus Christ right I'm not
[31:05] the part of the coming Messiah in the
[31:07] rulership but you have to turned him
[31:11] down
[31:14] yes but it's a brother we're good on
[31:17] behavior something I don't walk home bad
[31:19] not to walk home meeting you
[31:20] I just come from there no result Jesus I
[31:25] accepted Jesus as my savior but what
[31:28] else would you want me to do come on
[31:34] come on now you've been there you've
[31:39] been on both sides of the fence all
[31:42] right you've been there and set it to
[31:45] people right they were trying to help
[31:48] you and now what do you hear what else
[31:54] what you offered them I've accepted
[31:57] Jesus Christ as my savior what a
[32:03] Christian shouldn't women shouldn't cut
[32:07] to her now that's according to we we
[32:10] don't believe that that's some Old
[32:12] Testament thing you're rejecting the
[32:15] word how much wood could we stay on that
[32:19] that's why I don't preach on that life
[32:20] if you got to be preached to about your
[32:22] hair and you dress in your clothes by
[32:23] now forget it
[32:25] you've already rejected Jesus Christ
[32:28] turn on any tape come on get rock walk
[32:32] right over there in that church and
[32:33] listen to them talk about Jesus Christ
[32:36] and the love that he has and the things
[32:39] in the forgiving what about it but I've
[32:52] done everything I can do what do you
[32:56] want me to do oh I won't you get don't
[33:00] you repent what I've done that praise
[33:02] the Lord
[33:03] okay now once you be baptized like
[33:07] brother Mike Kennedy said when dumb is
[33:09] listening to radio broadcasting the man
[33:11] was coming across like that you know he
[33:13] was going through the scripture and he
[33:15] told us had read you know how the black
[33:16] people read one for the other he said
[33:18] read
[33:19] he's feller said repent he said repent
[33:23] you know the preacher reader read it the
[33:27] preacher
[33:27] Semih and he got that and be baptized in
[33:31] the name of Jesus Christ he said Oh
[33:35] you know you didn't agree with that you
[33:39] understand what I'm getting at simple a
[33:46] little matter in it you know yourself
[33:49] where you stood and you know where you
[33:52] came from and you know what you faced my
[33:56] baptism don't mean nothing
[34:01] rejecting the word well that's not
[34:04] rejected I don't know number one you
[34:09] don't know you've got an excuse number
[34:13] two now you know you have no excuse
[34:15] okay solve the problem you know what I'm
[34:19] talking about the truth you talk to
[34:21] people and try to get them to see Jesus
[34:24] Christ and you know where they came from
[34:27] because you came from die right but yet
[34:34] why won't they accept it it's just
[34:37] simple a matter they try to get you to
[34:42] see what they turn down Jesus said my
[34:49] word have no part in you you can't hear
[34:57] my word he said I'm a quoting scripture
[35:02] who was he according to the Bible he was
[35:07] the Word made flesh John 1:14 is it run
[35:13] he was the Word made flesh they were
[35:16] looking for a God and believing their
[35:20] God would be the word they had heard and
[35:23] studied made flesh right I mean am i
[35:30] right now
[35:31] see what we think those Jews all they do
[35:33] is you sit around ruler dogs everybody
[35:35] read way too easily we know they're
[35:37] studying that word you know what I loved
[35:43] when Reuben that Israeli God said to me
[35:46] he said Sam
[35:48] he said y'all took the Bible out of the
[35:51] school he said our children in school
[35:56] have the Koran the scriptures to thank
[36:00] layer1
[36:00] and said the Bible laying on the other
[36:03] side and said it's mandatory that you
[36:06] study that Bible and here we took them
[36:12] out of school but we're nation we're a
[36:14] great thing anyway oh yeah go to Russia
[36:19] right now and say I'm a homosexual and
[36:21] you ain't gonna live long go to America
[36:24] and say I'm a homosexual and make you
[36:28] ruler of imitation I won't say president
[36:32] because they ain't nobody said that
[36:33] about him yet so we just you know we
[36:34] just we forget all of that but listen
[36:38] what you're talking about really do
[36:43] Jesus Christ according to the Bible was
[36:46] to become first the Cornerstone right
[36:54] which would be God Almighty in human
[36:58] flesh dwelling on the earth is that - is
[37:02] that a summation of the Old Testament
[37:04] Bible speaking of the coming Messiah it
[37:11] is not that right with a Jew that
[37:14] brother Adam talked to and he asked him
[37:16] said who will the Messiah be he said oh
[37:18] you be God in human flesh
[37:20] well he's summing up the teachings of
[37:23] all of Israel right they no matter how
[37:25] it come who it came or when it come it
[37:28] would still be the Word made flesh it
[37:32] would be their God
[37:33] now this son and you'll see where you're
[37:37] going to trap your own sale they was not
[37:41] believing in three guards coming right
[37:50] because when Jesus said I and my father
[37:52] woman they said you're making yourself
[37:54] God because they was not looking for a
[37:59] trinity to come the word Trinity was not
[38:01] even it into being they were not looking
[38:07] for something like that to come and they
[38:10] knew that the Messiah would be God in
[38:12] human flesh when he stood there what
[38:20] happened they crucified since he was
[38:28] caught simply because he said he was God
[38:30] and yet he had ever signed to prove that
[38:34] he was until even they had to admit it
[38:37] the greatest were leaders Nicodemus
[38:39] Khmer etc no man can do these things
[38:42] Nicodemus to Lord you unless God be with
[38:45] you
[38:53] but yet because of their society they
[39:01] would not stand up for him as to being
[39:04] the Messiah tool even a heathen King
[39:10] would say were you this editor he sent
[39:15] unto this on in without board he just
[39:20] wrote him out a little decree put it on
[39:21] it said knighted overhead that he's a
[39:23] king of the Jews he didn't do that as a
[39:26] sarcastic matter but he didn't want to
[39:29] cause interaction he done it because it
[39:32] that was what the man was saying
[39:37] were they not looking for a king he was
[39:49] taken from being the king of Israel the
[39:56] Messiah
[39:57] anything you want to call him and made a
[40:02] common criminal but they hung him on a
[40:07] tree that's what they thought of him you
[40:16] get the emphasis they would try maybe to
[40:20] stone him at times but they decided that
[40:22] was maybe not a good idea it will hang
[40:24] him up before the world and let the
[40:26] world see what we think about him and
[40:33] they crucified him they had to because
[40:37] the word said it would be that way well
[40:40] why didn't they read the word to find
[40:42] out what to do you know what they could
[40:44] have read the word and found out how
[40:45] many nails in needed they could have
[40:47] read the word and found out how the man
[40:49] died and he would be piercing the side
[40:51] not a bone was broken they could they
[40:53] could say well a lot of trouble of
[40:55] having to go through living the things
[40:57] if it had just read the word before he
[41:00] sure is dumb are you with me
[41:07] but in final analysis what he wind up
[41:10] doing he wound up being the word made
[41:12] flesh and they turned it down the very
[41:15] thing they were looking for he said my
[41:19] word hath no part in you why don't you
[41:22] keep my saying code you can understand
[41:24] my words he would say is that Scripture
[41:28] what did it mean I didn't understand his
[41:30] speech no they didn't understand what he
[41:35] was saying because they knew he was
[41:38] saying things different from what they
[41:40] had heard before what about it
[41:46] did he not himself say you've rejected
[41:51] me and set up on this rock revelation of
[41:58] who I am
[42:00] not on Peter not on the other with
[42:02] Revelation who is Jesus Christ yet
[42:04] he said I'll build my church and the
[42:06] gates of Hell cannot prevail against
[42:08] that did that stop them from crucifying
[42:12] no that made for sure that he was going
[42:14] to he said the kingdom will be taken
[42:20] from you and given to a people that are
[42:23] not a people in other words are dogs or
[42:25] Gentiles you know when that took place
[42:32] he wound up being as I was emphasizing
[42:35] throughout the message you know when you
[42:37] say the headstone hasn't come yet now
[42:39] say people say well he don't believe it
[42:41] a good bit of the headstone Israel had a
[42:43] headstone he walked on the shores of
[42:46] Galilee he offered his life but he could
[42:49] not be their king
[42:50] their head had to become the cornerstone
[42:54] right but he became the head of the
[43:00] church around even said he's the head of
[43:03] the center he said God he created him
[43:07] he's ahead of all times right
[43:15] but listen what is it church to be built
[43:22] upon what was Israel and we went to what
[43:26] did they reject they reject the sonship
[43:28] they rejected all of the things we went
[43:30] through that Sunday and by rejecting all
[43:34] of those things see the revelation of
[43:40] God's Word was removed from them by the
[43:46] leaders is that right you stand in the
[43:51] doors there what Jesus said about and
[43:53] said you won't go in and said you won't
[43:55] let them win what percent of the hell
[43:59] you don't understand all I gotta do is
[44:01] just accept Jesus and just just tell if
[44:08] it has he accepted you what if he ain't
[44:14] is his fault
[44:15] you can good should take time go ahead
[44:18] you're playing the new devil's territory
[44:20] so go ahead because you're trying to
[44:23] make vain philosophies an answer to a
[44:25] serious question
[44:29] you're a talk to people you ever talk to
[44:35] people you know about the Word of God
[44:36] and like I said they always say against
[44:38] the Lord's coming real quick and then
[44:40] all at once you start saying with this
[44:41] and isn't this about to come and look we
[44:43] don't want we're not talking about him
[44:45] coming right now see it you talk to them
[44:50] about the word as I said about to hire
[44:52] the dress the clothes and when it's old
[44:54] you're just in that Old Testament stuff
[44:58] we're in the new testament well I guess
[45:00] New Testament means you can strip off
[45:06] the kind of written thing yesterday
[45:09] talking about this news commentator I
[45:12] won't call them names or nothing but you
[45:14] know you can make your vain philosophies
[45:17] as trying to conquer somebody by your
[45:20] words your superiority of your words
[45:22] that you use and that was what he was
[45:25] made known popular about doing back in
[45:27] the 30s 40s and it
[45:29] and it was real quick so that's what we
[45:37] think a quick answer you know when we're
[45:41] not in the New Testament we're I mean
[45:45] the olds had win the New Testament to
[45:47] see that person go back to the church
[45:49] well I straighten them out in people
[45:52] talking about that stuff and I told him
[45:54] we wouldn't in the Old Testament
[45:57] well I straighten them out did not and
[46:01] this news commentator he happened to
[46:03] have a wooden leg and so he said to a
[46:06] man that was in a group of singers they
[46:12] were sitting in front of him one day he
[46:13] was interviewing him and one of them had
[46:16] long hair and he looked over at him and
[46:17] he said well I guess sir the end you've
[46:19] got long hire so he was being sarcastic
[46:21] he said I guess being you got long hard
[46:24] makes you a woman being sarcastic nicely
[46:32] he was interviewing these people can
[46:34] even being real nice you know what the
[46:36] guy said back to he said sir said you've
[46:38] got a wooden leg I guess it makes you a
[46:40] table see he didn't want that I'm sure
[46:47] main philosophies will get us no work
[46:50] quick answers slow to thinking is the
[46:55] right way thank over what somebody says
[46:59] to you
[47:01] they've always Illustrated to you about
[47:03] brother Moe when he put me up against
[47:05] the wall about one God oh I had all of
[47:09] those answers I could have said all
[47:11] these things about God in three persons
[47:12] Blessed Trinity and nobody knows all
[47:15] about that stuff we were not able to
[47:17] know and he said your Trinity just like
[47:22] the rest of them I knew I was standing
[47:26] nailed to a wall and not in one hope to
[47:28] whatever my vain philosophy was doing no
[47:30] good I could scream and holler about all
[47:34] of my doings and what I've been told but
[47:36] you know what I said I said sure I don't
[47:37] believe that no more
[47:42] I had a little sense I knew where I
[47:44] stood but are you understanding what I'm
[47:49] getting at they rejected the person of
[47:57] the word that was standing before them
[48:04] the very hopes of anything
[48:08] now let's divide it just a little bit
[48:12] they were not looking for a new
[48:14] testament to come the old testament
[48:16] people wasn't because they couldn't
[48:17] understand the writings of david and all
[48:20] of the Psalms in the difference they
[48:22] didn't understand that that was why they
[48:24] rejected him when he came they didn't
[48:25] understand those things they were not
[48:27] looking for a kingdom to come
[48:29] that would be meek and on bullying and
[48:31] you know they were looking for somebody
[48:34] to be a David or AG lot you know a
[48:38] killer of Saul you know anybody that
[48:42] they could think of they thought that's
[48:43] who the Messiah was going to be he was
[48:45] going to get rid of them Romans he's
[48:47] gonna take over they wasn't looking for
[48:50] a new Testament because they had no way
[48:55] of understanding about it but yet we say
[49:00] we're in the New Testament it's one of
[49:06] jabber jabber words and I said I want to
[49:07] go that we just spout out to try to
[49:10] conquer somebody else with it you know
[49:17] but listen
[49:21] see the word spoke of him coming and the
[49:26] word spoke that he would be the word
[49:29] made flesh was that right read your Old
[49:35] Testament get in especially the Psalms
[49:37] and then especially Isaiah or something
[49:39] and get to that and try to follow it
[49:43] we'll get to one in a minute and let's
[49:45] see if we can if we don't we'll take it
[49:47] up later on the word because this is on
[49:51] my mind and this is what it's going to
[49:52] get off of my mind he he
[49:55] was the fulfillment of the word you
[49:59] agree with that then why would they
[50:04] stumble as Peter says at the word that
[50:06] we read now back up in your mind just a
[50:16] little bit and think of sensible things
[50:18] and be a human being for a minute and
[50:21] let's go away from the Prophet said one
[50:23] time we're so people are so spiritual
[50:26] until they're not worth nothing and then
[50:28] he says they're so natural that I not
[50:29] worth nothing spiritual something to
[50:31] that degree is my way of saying it
[50:34] anyway back up to where you came from
[50:38] and when you begin to hear the word and
[50:45] how you fought against the word but yet
[50:53] the word was being presented to you Ron
[50:56] you remember that back up in your life
[50:59] where you come from this be sensible I'm
[51:01] not backing up our code I'm come up here
[51:04] when you oh you're wonderful can you
[51:12] remember when you used to fight the
[51:13] truth then what would be if you had to
[51:21] face God at that time now come on we all
[51:30] the great philosophies you want your
[51:31] great words will do no good I'm asking
[51:33] you a simple question you were a
[51:40] Trinitarian right mostly everybody
[51:44] someone that's because we wasn't into
[51:47] the one that's line of that that much
[51:48] probably but we were back in the
[51:50] Trinitarian idea how would it be if you
[51:54] had to face God with that concept
[52:02] and he says I'm not that concept I'm
[52:08] trying to present a truth to you by
[52:10] person it's bringing the word to your
[52:14] understanding and why are you turning me
[52:18] down yeah but I cannot get away from
[52:21] that so you're making your super was it
[52:24] word super visual in other words you're
[52:27] making something great thing to try to
[52:29] conquer with it it ain't conquering me
[52:31] whatsoever that don't bother me
[52:33] whatsoever for you to run your vain
[52:34] mouth about what we believe this we I
[52:37] was just out of the other I can talk to
[52:39] I can say that I was probably more
[52:42] oneness when I was in back during I was
[52:44] Trinitarian but didn't make no
[52:45] difference are wrong on either side what
[52:49] I'm trying to get you to look at is one
[52:50] time what if God had demanded that you
[52:55] face him then where would we be
[53:01] well he understands come on are you
[53:05] philosophy see floating so you're trying
[53:07] to answer instead of being truthful
[53:09] you're not getting what I'm talking
[53:11] about
[53:12] what if God required for you to answer
[53:15] him with what you believe when you were
[53:18] a Baptist Methodist Presbyterian clinic
[53:20] long story etc what about the old ones
[53:29] that we don't like to state but you ever
[53:32] noticed you there most all of us make
[53:34] this one when mama said I was born to
[53:36] Baptists and I'm going down bad dish and
[53:45] you were sitting right there
[53:47] not saying what about mama she's a
[53:49] little off the wall but she's right
[53:57] time to get a point if you look at those
[54:02] Old Testament people were keeping the
[54:05] letter word to the letter we can't say
[54:10] we were keeping the word to the letter
[54:13] when we were back there where we came
[54:15] from
[54:20] no we've keeping what we thought was the
[54:22] word and God winked at her ignorance and
[54:27] brought us in that's good
[54:28] amen he brought us in but what if he's
[54:31] are required of it back then mm-hmm well
[54:39] what about now we won't go into it but
[54:44] what about in this message in the end
[54:45] time when there's so many doctrinal
[54:47] issues and so many things I have one
[54:49] message you so many people believe in
[54:51] this and so many people believe in that
[54:52] and all around the world it's just
[54:54] scattered everywhere and everybody's got
[54:55] their philosophies about what this is
[54:58] and what the Prophet told and all of it
[54:59] out of one message and your prophet
[55:05] would say I doubted dozen out of this
[55:08] generation to make a change well you
[55:13] know what that means
[55:14] oh you say but he didn't really mean it
[55:15] that way why don't say yeah yes oh okay
[55:18] what was he getting out a small number
[55:20] right seven billion people in the world
[55:24] if it would one be and believe the truth
[55:27] right now that'd be a small number right
[55:31] that'd be an equivalent of an eight
[55:33] people in the days of the flood compared
[55:36] to maybe eight million or whatever you'd
[55:40] want to run your days your taient you
[55:42] know what are you listening they
[55:48] stumbled at the Word made flesh he said
[55:57] show me were that I'm contrary to the
[56:00] word condemn me see they turn down the
[56:13] word that was standing before them what
[56:23] about now they failed to accept the word
[56:30] that would have been the Messiah now
[56:37] listen are you understanding what I'm
[56:39] talking about
[56:42] they were not looking for the Messiah to
[56:45] come as a baby right that was not their
[56:50] philosophies even though Isaiah had
[56:51] spoken anybody have had a few that was
[56:54] looking in searching but it wasn't
[56:57] looking for a baby to come they
[57:02] certainly weren't looking for a king to
[57:03] come riding in on a donkey and then
[57:05] beating the daylights out of everything
[57:07] stricken with his clothes took
[57:08] everything from him and hung him on a
[57:10] cross you remember the Prophet
[57:13] emphasizing those two on the road to
[57:15] Emmaus as they were going along because
[57:18] they said well this is what we thought
[57:19] we thought he was going to be king he
[57:21] said with we thought this going out and
[57:22] said look at her did they beat you and
[57:25] killed him and said now what are we even
[57:27] now they said well we don't need no said
[57:29] the body has been gone so we don't know
[57:30] what's going on you realize they turn
[57:39] down the right a rejecting him as the
[57:44] Messiah as the king they turned down the
[57:48] right of sonship is that where we've
[57:50] that Sunday Israel turned down the right
[57:53] of sonship right thinking they were the
[58:01] children of God
[58:03] you know until Jesus came they were
[58:07] come on let's go to our profit let's get
[58:10] him in the right order until Israel
[58:12] until Jesus come before Israel they were
[58:15] great everything's okay but when he came
[58:24] to them then they rejected him see they
[58:32] don't know what they turned down Jesus
[58:39] told him said now the kingdom that
[58:41] you've been doing and looking for it
[58:43] come he's standing here among you since
[58:49] you've rejected it said it's going to be
[58:53] taken from you remember
[58:55] and they said god forbid no no no he's
[58:59] going to be taken from you and given to
[59:00] a people that are even not of a name
[59:02] which the Gentile dog boy they really
[59:05] didn't like that did
[59:08] what are we done you see one Jesus never
[59:16] had confront a Shinra what you want to
[59:18] call them with the ferret that hi Frank
[59:20] in fire season too much he said well
[59:24] they would know how old he had dude what
[59:26] right in the info and you better believe
[59:29] they wouldn't nobody gonna stop him from
[59:31] walking by their words the high priest
[59:33] was that right you said they were tried
[59:38] yeah they were tried would you think
[59:40] they could have stopped him cuz remember
[59:41] Hey he was Almighty God you think they
[59:44] were going to do no and he never went
[59:46] before Caiaphas that's or any high
[59:48] priest that's what I'm trying to get you
[59:49] to see there was no need of going to
[59:56] them they had already turned him down he
[1:00:01] said yeah but what about us what is the
[1:00:09] new birth
[1:00:14] remember they don't want we talk about
[1:00:16] Sunday
[1:00:16] they rejected sunshield they rejected
[1:00:19] the new burro see because they had no
[1:00:22] way had it figured out that he was going
[1:00:25] to come a baby and he was going to grow
[1:00:27] up and he was going to die for their
[1:00:28] sins
[1:00:31] and then he was going to come back and
[1:00:34] live within them in a new birth right
[1:00:36] none of that Old Testament people had it
[1:00:38] figured out even if the great religious
[1:00:42] leaders even after you come on into the
[1:00:44] church ology of thinking about Jesus
[1:00:46] Christ with the disciples and they get
[1:00:49] over and acts one after Jesus's
[1:00:52] resurrection and they are still saying
[1:00:54] are you going to return the kingdom to
[1:00:58] Israel at this time they were not
[1:01:01] looking for him to come back and live in
[1:01:04] their lives to give them an uber that's
[1:01:09] why I've always preached is where I am
[1:01:11] what is the new birth brother branham
[1:01:13] Christ mystery of God reveal wonder
[1:01:15] decide paragraph 3 333 and 334 Christ
[1:01:19] the mystery of God revealed what is the
[1:01:21] new birth right around him it's
[1:01:22] revelation Jesus Christ personally to
[1:01:25] you not you said of creed not you read a
[1:01:27] book not you done to this aren't you
[1:01:29] done of these things it's a revelation
[1:01:30] of Jesus Christ personally to you was
[1:01:32] that not the rock that he was talking
[1:01:34] about when he said upon this rock I'll
[1:01:36] build my church and the gates of Hell
[1:01:38] shall not prevail against it do you
[1:01:43] think those Old Testament people was
[1:01:45] looking for anything like that okay
[1:01:52] simple questions for a few minutes what
[1:01:54] are we looking for what are you looking
[1:01:57] for I'll give it to you all the time and
[1:02:03] it's just simple way of saying it we
[1:02:09] think he's coming in the bush and we go
[1:02:10] down to the airport wait on the bus now
[1:02:18] you know what that means don't you
[1:02:20] that means we're not following the
[1:02:22] prescription
[1:02:25] we were going over to see brother
[1:02:27] Jeffrey's one time two years ago the
[1:02:29] only time they ever had anybody hardly
[1:02:30] even run something up because I don't
[1:02:31] trust all that stuff and to show you it
[1:02:34] didn't work they told us I told him I
[1:02:36] said you run it up for me to be able to
[1:02:37] go and one of the kids run it up for us
[1:02:40] to go to to be able to find brother Jeff
[1:02:42] researcher at the nursing home we see I
[1:02:45] knew where the road went into Covington
[1:02:48] and 11 and how it turned and which you
[1:02:51] go in and turn that go back this way and
[1:02:52] come back around we followed that thing
[1:02:55] to the letter Maracana ever turn ever
[1:02:58] screw tree every one of them was perfect
[1:03:02] we wound up sitting in the middle of a
[1:03:05] subdivision looking for a nursing home
[1:03:09] and we kept riding around and around I
[1:03:13] said well maybe it's your someone and he
[1:03:15] said we might we'll forget it a take
[1:03:16] down here what happened to be a guy on
[1:03:19] the side of the road work and stop and
[1:03:20] ask him we're sewing so nursing home I
[1:03:25] said according to the directions it
[1:03:27] supposed to be right here and I mean
[1:03:29] street numbers Road numbers everything
[1:03:34] when the coordinates piece of paper a
[1:03:36] wife can verify that guy said you are
[1:03:40] you familiar with coming out yesterday
[1:03:42] around a little bit he said you know
[1:03:43] where you come in to Covington and said
[1:03:46] it makes a left turn and it goes down in
[1:03:49] a swing kind of round little I said yes
[1:03:51] sir he said the nursing home said you go
[1:03:53] back to where you spoke when you turn
[1:03:55] left he said turn right right iris of
[1:03:56] Nursing I followed every direction
[1:04:02] according to the piece of paper with the
[1:04:06] numbers and everything and didn't get to
[1:04:09] the right place he said well what are
[1:04:14] you talking about
[1:04:14] I'm talking about some body goofed up in
[1:04:19] installing the software for that thing
[1:04:22] it wasn't their fault for looking it up
[1:04:24] it was right he just showed you
[1:04:27] mechanics don't work too good unless
[1:04:29] you're right all right and it might wind
[1:04:34] up to be like this we're coming out from
[1:04:35] brother
[1:04:36] Henry's one time and illustrate
[1:04:39] we've come driving out and I started to
[1:04:41] turn right and I said you got to go lay
[1:04:42] out I said we gotta go ride she said you
[1:04:45] got to go lay out and now we got to go
[1:04:46] ride it she said we got to go left to
[1:04:49] get back home I said okay okay I agree
[1:04:51] with you 2,500 miles around the world I
[1:04:55] said we were left she decided about the
[1:04:57] end I knew or that you know so sometimes
[1:04:59] it's better just old-fashioned murder
[1:05:02] trails you know knowing where you're at
[1:05:04] is better is my point than it is to read
[1:05:07] all the books about everything but
[1:05:10] somebody didn't get in right place my
[1:05:11] point is what the religious world of the
[1:05:15] Old Testament had man set mind set to
[1:05:19] mankind of all forms and every one of
[1:05:22] them missed even though they call him
[1:05:25] Messiah even though they call him King
[1:05:27] even though they call him ruler they
[1:05:29] miss how he was coming but yet he put it
[1:05:33] in earth to the letter he was gonna come
[1:05:35] as a baby he was gonna come up and out
[1:05:39] to be killed he was going to come up and
[1:05:43] have to give his life and come and live
[1:05:49] in the people and they rejected it that
[1:05:54] was the word I'm talking about they
[1:05:55] rejected so what about you and I Jesus
[1:06:02] said to those he said in John 8 and 37
[1:06:05] I know that you're Abraham's seed we
[1:06:11] said you're trying to kill me because my
[1:06:14] word had no place in you
[1:06:24] you cannot hear my word well you can't
[1:06:30] understand my speech
[1:06:33] John 1843 okay so you've been hammering
[1:06:42] this for three services and it looks
[1:06:45] like I'm a hammer mower so it's alright
[1:06:51] you're not following maybe my point if
[1:06:56] you backed up 20 30 40 years ago to
[1:06:58] where you come from him denominational
[1:07:00] churches all of us would come down to
[1:07:03] that we had our origin there and we can
[1:07:06] preach the great philosophies of how
[1:07:07] great and wonderful God letters in
[1:07:09] that's true he did he brought us to the
[1:07:11] right he brought us to the truth but
[1:07:13] remember why we was there what is he
[1:07:15] required of that day for us to answer
[1:07:20] him according to his word would we be an
[1:07:27] idiot written in Israel what about now
[1:07:35] just go follow some of these ideas you
[1:07:38] know why all these ideas come up because
[1:07:40] people come up with the idea that they
[1:07:41] got some way to get us out of here and
[1:07:44] you know in a way I appreciate them for
[1:07:45] being that way I hate lazy people that
[1:07:47] just shift it so long we don't need to
[1:07:49] understand the word oh we got to just
[1:07:52] stay real simple and do nothing
[1:07:53] hey you ain't gonna get nowhere with me
[1:07:56] like that we don't need them deep things
[1:08:02] we need to stay with a simplicity saying
[1:08:08] this to the person on the internet that
[1:08:10] actually the question about it they
[1:08:12] stand for the truth on all the message
[1:08:17] stand for the truth no matter where
[1:08:20] you're at stand for the truth it's the
[1:08:22] only answer I give to somebody that asks
[1:08:24] me a question about fit because we were
[1:08:27] wondering about ideas and doctrines and
[1:08:29] salts stand with the truth because then
[1:08:32] when you do your stand alone don't worry
[1:08:35] about it
[1:08:36] she truly then the new birth is the
[1:08:39] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:08:41] and by that new birth coming into the
[1:08:44] disciples we come to Ephesians 2 in 20
[1:08:46] now that we're built on the foundation
[1:08:49] of the apostles and prophets Jesus
[1:08:51] Christ being the chief Cornerstone right
[1:08:56] you notice that it's not emphasized that
[1:09:00] much but notice it said we're built on
[1:09:02] the foundation of the apostles and
[1:09:03] prophets why would he emphasized and
[1:09:08] prophets be all the Old Testament
[1:09:14] prophets this statue of a perfect man is
[1:09:18] built on the foundation apostles and
[1:09:21] prophets it's built on the Jesus Christ
[1:09:24] of the Old Testament those disciples
[1:09:28] were bringing that's why Paul went to
[1:09:29] the backside of the desert to read the
[1:09:31] scrolls to bring his messengers Jesus
[1:09:33] Christ
[1:09:34] he went back and studied the prophets
[1:09:36] right so when it says apostles that's
[1:09:40] New Testament people because they're
[1:09:42] called apostles you remember that
[1:09:45] they're called disciples when they were
[1:09:47] just believers right so your scripture
[1:09:51] and go through it and read them Matthew
[1:09:52] Mark Luke and John and watch them be
[1:09:54] disciples then watch it when it comes on
[1:09:55] over there changed to apostles you know
[1:09:58] what it is
[1:09:59] apostle is just like a person but I mean
[1:10:03] a disciple but an apostle is one sent
[1:10:06] all right so we're built on not just the
[1:10:10] foundation to what Peter Paul James John
[1:10:13] and those men of the New Testament bro
[1:10:15] we're built on the foundation of the
[1:10:16] entire Old Testament that said Jesus
[1:10:21] Christ would come as the chief
[1:10:23] Cornerstone he would be head of the
[1:10:25] church as Paul would bring him you can
[1:10:31] go through the husband and the wife that
[1:10:33] he would be or all of your studies would
[1:10:40] see down through times in in other words
[1:10:45] they had what we would call the faith of
[1:10:47] the father you agree there's a shopper
[1:10:50] trying to move into the message now what
[1:10:58] questions we have should be answered by
[1:11:01] the Apostles you agree admit that we
[1:11:08] still took that and interpreted what we
[1:11:10] want to do out of it to mean what it
[1:11:12] meant but you can still can't change
[1:11:14] what we said because the New Testament
[1:11:17] brought Jesus Christ not looking for him
[1:11:23] to come in flesh of being but we meet
[1:11:25] him in the air right pleased to come in
[1:11:28] our flesh you not to come back here as a
[1:11:32] person standing on the earth in human
[1:11:34] flesh he's not made to be that way
[1:11:36] we meet him in the air see the word made
[1:11:40] flesh he's dealing with you and I now
[1:11:44] now listen what is the faith of the
[1:11:47] father's as I said the other day
[1:11:49] illustrate we say faith for the father
[1:11:50] and by the say faith no this entire
[1:11:54] period where you come to not the
[1:11:56] headstone but all of this is the faith
[1:11:59] of the father's that's what Peter was
[1:12:00] explaining in second Peter add to your
[1:12:03] faith virtue knowledge temperance
[1:12:04] godliness president kind of that is the
[1:12:06] faith of the fathers now the age is down
[1:12:10] through time never received that they
[1:12:13] only received a partial realization for
[1:12:15] the time and they came forth after the
[1:12:18] dark ages with the just shall live by
[1:12:21] faith but that was the faith you we've
[1:12:24] been through that over and over volition
[1:12:28] the Bible had already spoken in the New
[1:12:30] Testament trying to run fights to get
[1:12:32] you just a little bit the New Testament
[1:12:35] had already spoken the Old Testament
[1:12:38] showed that he would be crucified but
[1:12:42] what about in the New Testament showing
[1:12:44] where he would be crucified again and
[1:12:46] put to an open shame by who
[1:12:49] who's there going to hang on a tree now
[1:12:55] he's not here in flesh they hung the
[1:12:58] people in the dark ages on the tree but
[1:13:00] that's not the point right
[1:13:03] what he's being rejected in the last
[1:13:05] days that he's outside the church and I
[1:13:10] don't mind saying it forget it do what
[1:13:11] you want to the biggest portion of
[1:13:13] people is this message has already put
[1:13:15] him outside why because the word is not
[1:13:17] read not accepted in those churches
[1:13:18] where the words not accepted God's not
[1:13:21] dark right where do you think you're
[1:13:25] that I'm being forget it come and show
[1:13:28] me where I'm wrong that's open the
[1:13:30] internet been open ever since we turned
[1:13:31] it on come and show me where I'm wrong
[1:13:37] don't you worry about it I'll come back
[1:13:39] and tell the people and name you that
[1:13:41] told the people that I was wrong but you
[1:13:46] see cause when you stand like that you
[1:13:47] don't have to worry because I'm not I'm
[1:13:50] not trying to make anything to try to
[1:13:52] make a kingdom I told you in that
[1:13:55] message I was looking at it again
[1:13:56] yesterday or twice I listened to like
[1:13:58] Sunday's message I was crying in my
[1:14:01] heart to go to these old far in fields
[1:14:03] and hear them people talk about this
[1:14:05] message and how perverted the people had
[1:14:07] made it yet they're quoting them as
[1:14:10] Peter Paul and John then they turn
[1:14:12] around and quote brother so-and-so and
[1:14:14] brother so-and-so and brother so-and-so
[1:14:15] I set my heart then to one time I
[1:14:21] appreciate straight hair I won't preach
[1:14:24] I said that one time the brother said
[1:14:28] when you tried to quit it lula said come
[1:14:30] on where I'm at I said you don't
[1:14:31] understand
[1:14:33] that's a brother you don't understand I
[1:14:37] said the day I can't preach in Lula what
[1:14:40] God gives me I will preach no more
[1:14:43] anywhere you mean I can't preach in my
[1:14:49] own church what I would believe I don't
[1:14:54] agree William trouble come and tell me
[1:14:58] that's all I've ever asked and people
[1:15:01] leave and go off and say all a lot of
[1:15:03] that's that enough but why don't they
[1:15:04] come and tell me that's all I've ever
[1:15:07] happens it makes you sarcastic so what
[1:15:15] makes me what I am - but listen the
[1:15:20] church started out on the Deaf Pentecost
[1:15:22] on the faith of the father's right the
[1:15:31] upper room there was 120 we see the
[1:15:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost that put them
[1:15:36] up where you call brotherly kindness on
[1:15:37] your pyramid bringing down all of them
[1:15:41] ain't going to argue with you I am going
[1:15:44] to say that least the Apostles that walk
[1:15:45] with the Lord Jesus receive those things
[1:15:48] as their new birth but on the outside
[1:15:51] they was because they'd heard the word
[1:15:53] and then with it three and a half-year
[1:15:54] but outside there was a group of people
[1:15:56] 3,000 received the Holy Ghost on the day
[1:15:58] of Pentecost that only heard one sermon
[1:16:00] now don't tell me they got to faith
[1:16:03] through the father's but here in one
[1:16:04] sermon if they did why was peter wanting
[1:16:05] to teach us how to get to the faith of
[1:16:07] the father the sea it was talked to the
[1:16:11] early church and it like stood for for
[1:16:14] ages I'm quoting brother Branham if you
[1:16:15] want these for ages and he said the word
[1:16:18] went into the ground that Nicaea under
[1:16:21] Columba ever how you pronounce it
[1:16:24] crumble the fourth church age the pure
[1:16:30] and unadulterated word he said went into
[1:16:32] the ground beseech all said you can't
[1:16:40] confirm palm or locust and the
[1:16:41] caterpillar would eat the church down
[1:16:43] and it started eating on it heavily
[1:16:45] right after the disciples are and by the
[1:16:48] fourth church age annotated into the
[1:16:50] ground but God said I will restore the
[1:16:53] years of the cankerworm pouring locals
[1:16:55] to caterpillar I'll bring it back and he
[1:16:58] started in Martin Luther to bring it
[1:17:00] back he started in John Wesley to bring
[1:17:01] it back and the people of this message
[1:17:03] of preachers don't even want to believe
[1:17:05] what Martin Luther told of the truths
[1:17:07] that is just shall live by faith
[1:17:08] oh we're beyond all that I had we're up
[1:17:11] here with a headstone there like I asked
[1:17:13] a brother of my house one day I said
[1:17:14] would you mind telling me what the
[1:17:15] headstone is you say you're going to go
[1:17:21] beyond brother Branham
[1:17:24] yeah that's what we believe he swept off
[1:17:26] the foundation when you'll get to it
[1:17:29] in Zechariah but I do ask you to read
[1:17:31] zechariah and listen to a message called
[1:17:34] what is it message of grace if you
[1:17:45] listen to that and read zechariah 4
[1:17:47] we'll get to it but that brother he said
[1:17:49] when we go beyond brother random he just
[1:17:52] swept off the foundation I said well
[1:17:54] okay tell me beyond the future huh I
[1:17:56] know I'm sarcastic
[1:17:58] sorry hateful right glory at least you
[1:18:04] know where I'm at I said tell me
[1:18:07] something beyond the future home because
[1:18:10] Road around free sister the future home
[1:18:12] I said why don't you get in the message
[1:18:16] or get out the man's wife looked at me
[1:18:19] and said brother Dale you're right II or
[1:18:20] to get in or get out of the message that
[1:18:22] was his choice it wasn't against a man I
[1:18:26] was just telling the God's honest truth
[1:18:28] I'm not against anybody in their
[1:18:30] thoughts and ideas
[1:18:31] I love the Brethren but there's one
[1:18:33] thing about it when it comes to the word
[1:18:36] we're gonna stand on the word but joe
[1:18:39] said i will restore the years of the
[1:18:41] cankerworm locust a caterpillar i will
[1:18:44] restore luther started a restoration but
[1:18:52] it really turned to be a reformation am
[1:18:54] i quoting the prophet west become was
[1:18:58] more of restoration but it turned to be
[1:19:01] reformation he said the Pentecostals
[1:19:05] came with more bringing restoration he
[1:19:08] said but it turned to be reformation
[1:19:10] even to the holy ghost onizuka street
[1:19:13] he's calling it reformation why because
[1:19:16] his carnal reforms this message was to
[1:19:21] come to bring restoration i preached it
[1:19:25] to you for years and years in your
[1:19:28] Melancon floor Malachi fuller says what
[1:19:33] if during the hearts of the children to
[1:19:35] the father's and the father's to the
[1:19:37] children right John the Baptist came to
[1:19:41] turn them one way
[1:19:43] they got to be an endtime message come
[1:19:45] turn them back don't go into your
[1:19:47] scriptures with John and say well he
[1:19:48] done this out of the other color I'm
[1:19:49] gonna quote dirt around them
[1:19:51] you couldn't have John turning them to
[1:19:52] the New Testament and then turn them
[1:19:54] back to the Old Testament that's what
[1:19:55] you're saying we see you don't listen to
[1:19:57] that your smart-aleck lis you won't
[1:19:59] listen to a simple terminology then what
[1:20:01] would ever happen what you see Lutheran
[1:20:06] Wesleyan em didn't have the restored
[1:20:08] word back to the faith of the Father but
[1:20:11] according to the Prophet on 327 with a
[1:20:13] lady OC in church age what is it this
[1:20:15] prophet in the end time is to do contain
[1:20:16] one turned the hearts of the children
[1:20:18] back to the face of the father to reveal
[1:20:20] the seven thunders which is revelation
[1:20:22] containing the seventh seal and it'll be
[1:20:24] these divinely revealed mystery truth
[1:20:25] that literally Turney I'm quoting him
[1:20:27] word for word turn the church back see
[1:20:30] there was no way for the church to be
[1:20:32] turned back that you could understand
[1:20:35] what it would be to mean to reject the
[1:20:36] word god winked at ignorance of Luther
[1:20:42] and Wesley a.m. in Azusa Street but no
[1:20:44] longer after this message has come in 50
[1:20:47] years that we've had to study it there's
[1:20:50] no point of saying God is winking at her
[1:20:52] ignorance no he's commanded all men to
[1:20:54] repent it's not your ideas or my ideas
[1:20:59] that's why I say come on
[1:21:01] I'm not sarcastic and hateful you show
[1:21:04] me the truth I'll be glad to receive it
[1:21:06] and come right here and tell you who
[1:21:07] told it but until that day comes don't
[1:21:11] call me or Susie 5 peti 8 little ideas I
[1:21:15] stand for one thing the Word of God this
[1:21:19] message has the answer to every question
[1:21:22] I just quoted you the point
[1:21:26] who's going to restore the faith of the
[1:21:28] father that's why we're going to get
[1:21:30] into it I'm right down to it now
[1:21:33] Zachariah for when we say just a word
[1:21:37] Zechariah was a great Prince that
[1:21:40] restored the temple he laid the
[1:21:47] foundation he built the building
[1:21:53] Zacharias to bring forth the headstone
[1:22:04] Zechariah was to bring forth the edge
[1:22:06] strong brother Branham says notice the
[1:22:10] scripture it does not say he will
[1:22:14] restore the cornerstone
[1:22:17] he said he'll praying that hitch tongue
[1:22:22] even though Zachariah rebuilt the temple
[1:22:27] he still put the thorn the stones right
[1:22:31] were probably some of them were left
[1:22:33] around the edges and he put her right
[1:22:37] down where it was this message church
[1:22:46] has to be the headstone to the church or
[1:22:52] what are you looking for I end with that
[1:22:56] tape statement because I don't have time
[1:23:00] this message if this message is not the
[1:23:04] headstone of the church tell me where
[1:23:05] it's coming from
[1:23:08] tell me words to be and what it is no
[1:23:12] they turn down the word back there so
[1:23:15] does the people at this end time turn
[1:23:17] down the message or the hour by making
[1:23:20] it whatever they want it to be come on
[1:23:21] musician making it what they want it to
[1:23:24] be I think is this I think is that
[1:23:27] that's why I like to read I like to ask
[1:23:33] for the rental questions so yeah but we
[1:23:36] can ask them questions now haha that's
[1:23:38] where you're wrong right about them what
[1:23:41] is the evidence of the Holy Ghost when
[1:23:45] we've got all of these problems and
[1:23:47] things about everybody saying it he said
[1:23:49] evidential the Holy Ghost where the
[1:23:51] spirit in you agrees word enough he just
[1:23:53] answered your question right and what is
[1:23:57] the new verb well it's the interest
[1:23:58] added these other pieces visitor right
[1:24:00] around and what is an uber he says
[1:24:02] revelation Jesus Christ personally
[1:24:05] run around him what is the Seventh Seal
[1:24:13] wrote around said it was the coming of
[1:24:15] the Lord but I thought it was even I
[1:24:22] thought that's what you're thinking you
[1:24:24] ain't asked the question you didn't ask
[1:24:26] the question get an answer you asked a
[1:24:29] question to get what you think is an
[1:24:31] answer he said it's the coming of the
[1:24:33] Lord and we believe the report that has
[1:24:43] been made to us I got it pictures I got
[1:24:46] just got notes laying on my desk and
[1:24:51] believe believe the report it has been
[1:24:56] made to us I believe that word the
[1:24:59] Prophet says okay where ya at today the
[1:25:08] Bible says forsake not just sending that
[1:25:09] yourselves together the Prophet said
[1:25:14] that we're yeah you see what I mean folk
[1:25:25] we all we don't reject the message well
[1:25:30] the message tells you all the answers
[1:25:33] you agree well that fearfully show me
[1:25:38] what he said it was give me a definition
[1:25:42] of the new bird from the Prophet that
[1:25:44] does not identically fit this revelation
[1:25:47] of Jesus Christ personally to you he
[1:25:51] just making it simple I think you're
[1:25:57] showing so I think you do
[1:26:01] could it be that we've rejected the
[1:26:04] stone I have stood here for three
[1:26:08] services proving one time the religious
[1:26:11] world and I'm talking about they're
[1:26:12] believers of this message the religious
[1:26:15] world has turned down the word of
[1:26:18] odd just exactly in the same way that
[1:26:22] Israel of old turned it down just
[1:26:25] exactly like the denomination's has
[1:26:28] turned it down could we turn it down be
[1:26:41] careful when you say you believe
[1:26:42] everything the word says remember what I
[1:26:50] said about the guy that was a smart
[1:26:51] aleck told that guy said you got long
[1:26:55] liar so I guess it makes you a woman I
[1:26:56] think I look back at him and said you
[1:26:58] got a wooden leg I guess that makes you
[1:27:00] a table just remember you quote all you
[1:27:04] want to but you're going to come back to
[1:27:08] face the Word of God what is the new
[1:27:12] birth right around the revelation of
[1:27:14] Jesus Christ personally to you now what
[1:27:19] if you ain't heard the revelation of
[1:27:21] Jesus Christ and I end it by quoting one
[1:27:25] man a man run into people that had walk
[1:27:31] with the word studied the word been with
[1:27:34] the word been later the man that
[1:27:37] introduced them men on the river and yet
[1:27:41] one day he said you're great believers
[1:27:45] and you're doing this and you're doing
[1:27:47] that and you are declaring cause there
[1:27:50] was who was it
[1:27:51] was his name he was preaching that Jesus
[1:27:54] was the Christ right acts and then was
[1:28:00] preaching that Jesus was the Christ but
[1:28:03] not knowing that he'd been crucified he
[1:28:08] said let me ask you a question have you
[1:28:11] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:28:13] believed me ask you another same
[1:28:20] question have you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:28:23] since you come into message
[1:28:32] what is your holy ghost grip surely it
[1:28:40] has to be the Lord Jesus Christ why
[1:28:47] would we need a prophet because you got
[1:28:50] to deal with restoration then when the
[1:28:55] church can come back to the faith of the
[1:28:57] fathers I'll quote you one quote that
[1:29:02] we're going to in the message that'll be
[1:29:05] next Sunday what about the head and body
[1:29:08] is going to unite in the last days to
[1:29:13] bring the message
[1:29:23] you want to cook that hidden body is to
[1:29:28] unite in the last days to bring the next
[1:29:30] siege but yeah we know all about it
[1:29:37] don't we the Stan
[1:29:41] be we can turn down the cornerstone and
[1:29:45] reject a headstone there's no need to
[1:29:47] talk about headstone until we see the
[1:29:48] cornerstone you said well brother Dale I
[1:29:51] know what the cornerstone it's a
[1:29:53] revelation of Jesus Christ amen
[1:29:58] but where would that fit in with a two
[1:30:00] sold seven Thunder peru's is River
[1:30:03] Jordan the people of this message where
[1:30:06] would it fit when even like river jordan
[1:30:14] says he wasn't even God until the River
[1:30:16] Jordan came and then God Vacanti became
[1:30:18] caught and then God left him in the
