was you did he did it yesterday now let him do it today is that wonderful and God bless you you may be seeing it just for a moment praise God Amen and I will take off my watch praise the Lord amen praise God hallelujah amen one of my problems has been over the years is um when I start to do a subject it gets so so just grows amen instead of you know four pages you've got six or seven eight pages nine pages and am I going to preach that all the one sermon you can't do it but thank God so I've tried to keep this down low today amen for the morning anyway so uh it's just I want to tell you how sweet it is how nice it is to be back amen and uh praise God the devil can put things many things on the earth and the pandemic was one of them and but I'll tell you what um uh we got through that and here we are on the other side amen PR it didn't matter to us because he never stopped us the word never stopped going around the world Amen we were able to stream and praise God and on our property uh I never seen my little town so empty there wasn't nothing everything was closed and just I don't even know why I was there but I was driving through it was the only one there and uh amen so we had to do that but having our own property we could walk around and get our exercise and things like that but amen we shall not be defeated brother W was right he says we are in the victory praise God Amen Hallelujah the scripture cannot be broken amen we know who we are we know where we came from and we know where we're going amen praise the Lord amen so it's just so nice to be with you and um things change nothing in this life stays the same and I'm sure you a lot of you are old enough to know that that life has changed things happen and we're just out of control of that but as brother Branham used to always say we can't stay here amen and we would reach the point when amen and sometimes it's younger than older amen you reach the point where God calls you home for whatever reason but the thing is to know that he is in control amen and the thing to know is I'm sure i' be talking to some people today that might not even think much of themselves but you are important to God he cares for you and you're important and you are here for a purpose amen you say well I don't feel like I mean what purpose the very fact that you're sitting there and you're fulfilling a purpose amen praise God we you know the Lord has has has ordained us and and I love that because in this message amen that we love praise God we can see that ordination in the things that we do and and what is happening and we look at the world and we can see the world for what it is and Putin for what he is in Ukraine you know uh amen but I'll tell you what we're looking for the coming of the Lord amen we're looking for the coming of the Lord so uh certainly it was lovely to see sister Peggy a face to face this morning I was talking to her one time on the phone uh and it was lovely just at the beginning when brother Samuel about two year and when he was just beginning to do that and I've been through all that uh maybe differences and different things happen to different people but we've been through it with my own wife and I'm not going to say much about that save this that maybe later on I'll give you a little breakdown of it but uh certainly what I know is that it was her time cuz brother just remember this just remember this it's God that takes you amen the day that you're called it's God it's not it's nobody else got that choice not the devil not sickness not nothing he's the one that says today this minute it's your time amen like same when you were born praise God the same when you go Hallelujah that right amen praise God certainly is so we're so glad about that today amen and um bless God I was so so thrilled there's uh I I I would just have to say this because the pandemic stopped us traveling and then when my my wife began to develop the dementia the vascular dementia um well I I I I I I just promised her that I would never leave her and I actually cared for her for two years three years and uh and we never went to any other country I think I took her to Scotland at one stage and that's another story but uh praise God uh yeah but I never after and this year this year we were over in the grand Canary Islands in uh January lovely 26° weather or would it be about 74 something like got over here but uh beautiful weather and we enjoyed it and she enjoyed it and I was so glad we had that time together with my daughter there and God is good Hallelujah there's too many people in I'm looking out at today that knows that they don't have me to tell them it cuz they know it's the truth they've experienced it they know God is good Hallelujah and God likes to do nice things for his people amen he really cares for us praise the Lord so I'm so glad he's worked everything out for us amen and and and I'm just glad to be here today and fellowship with you all and God willing we're going to see uh brother Samuel this afternoon amen and I've got a couple of little photographs of my wife and you can see that the change we know it's there it it happens in our life and and praise God if you say brother George are you afraid to die I can tell you I'm not afraid to die if this was right my last day I'll tell you I'm ready praise God I'm ready I know i' step right into that theophany body hallelujah praise God I seen my wife going into it I know it's there it's real it's not just some pie in the sky when you die thing I heard our brother speak this morning about the eth this and that well amen praise God yeah you can say a lot about that as well but we're not amen and I'm just I'm just so thankful and God bless you Sister Peggy amen all the family and when I actually saw uh when I actually saw uh uh amen and the first one I came to to day Terrence and you know I never said it to him but my when I first came about that's the way brother deal looked brother Samuel that's the way he looked just you could see that that that and that's what I thought yeah just I can remember all them years ago he looked like that so amen and and and it doesn't really matter but the jeans are all there in the family and we're so thankful for that today so it's lovely we got to watch the the time and as i s say more about my dear wife later on but uh when we I did make a promise that we would get the I'll show you this surround and all that where um we made a promise to the Lord that I wouldn't do anything until uh we have it a bit little bit different in in Ireland uh in the churchyard which is buried to have a surround with it and and the nice Stones over that and then the two headstones one for her mama and one for her and I and uh that's the way it is the way we do it it's a lovely place and I've got a little photograph on my phone you you see it from there you can see it all and it's in the rivers beside it and uh and if if I if the Lord carries and I go I'll be right beside her I'll be right there with her so uh amen uh but as I say more on that later amen but I wouldn't come anywhere until that was all set up and now it's all done there's nothing more I can do physically for her and and we've been there a lot actually about three or four months it's about a a kilometer away from us and that would be about what a third of a mile or something like that so it's easy just to pop down and just reminisce with her and it's like my grandfather when his wife passed away he said now remember this he said it's not goodbye he said it's just good night he said it's just good night he said I will see you in the morning amen is that right folks praise God well Hallelujah Hallelujah wonderful to see and I can see a move in the church uh it's wonderful praise God that the sprits there and we're all uplifted and moving on and we are on a Higher Ground now Lord put my feet on a higher we're on a high more Higher Ground than we've ever been on amen and praise God we're getting closer and closer to that day and that pull is there amen and we can feel it Hallelujah experience it amen and that Crystal is in tune with God hallelujah that soul is in tune with God and I tell you it's good things amen that the world's in darkness and we're in go we're walking in the light as he is in the light well um amen I suppose you wonder what you know about a pastor and how do you get your messages and what are you doing things just happen in different ways you can get a message in different ways but wasn't all that long ago I I was reading that little scripture in in in Galatians amen and it says uh for I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me amen Christ liveth in me and the life that I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God Amen now there's a man speaking about something that has happened in his life amen and that's the whole criteria of it amen something got to happen to you and you know it happened amen you were there praise the Lord and and and now you're living a different life and that would be the the title m message the life that I now live I live by the faith of Jesus Christ now you will forgive me amen because I'm going to come to that in a later point but uh it was just a few weeks ago that about 6:00 in the morning I I I woke up and you know a minister will tell you this sometimes when he gets real close and he starts to it comes like a machine gun you know and you're thinking about it sometimes you get it wrote down and you're thinking about it and this is the way it came to me and that's what you're getting this morning so you just understand that amen cuz I want to take you different directions amen but first of all I what did you call it sadoku is that what you call it over here Soko okay and I'm sure a lot of you maybe you're one I don't know but I'm sure we'd all know what that that game is you know soku amen where you've got your your box and you've got your three or nine n squares in it and your letters and you have to join them all up and one line and then the box and and all the words you know and and uh I never did that I mean I'm what 76 years of age and I and I never did that and only when when my wife passed away that that I I picked it up one of her books one day and I started to do it so I've been doing it ever since amen with varying degrees of success but but amen I I was thinking about that as we start off the message amen and and I was just thinking you know when this message came to me about about numbers you got to get your numbers right praise God and and and and and uh you know I would I would like to just talk about that for a moment for the younger people uh maybe not so younger people about the numbers in the Bible amen uh just for a moment amen like if you looked at say the first 10 up to 12 numbers but I'll not go into 11 but you know numbers are important amen and and the first number is that the Lord your God is one amen amen is one I preached just a message not that long a go to my own congregation that what you can't separate and what you should be separated so you can't separate the godhead this here I was looking at there brother we did this morning you can't separate that amen there's your morphe there Hallelujah there's the servant who thought it not robbery to be eagle with God and you can't separate it you can't separate Jesus from Christ or Christ from Jesus it is the one person amen and so praise God the logus you can't separate the logus from the amorph cuz they are one one part of it God I might even speak about a little bit I was often wondered about Divinity you know like divinity we know about deity he's God he's all powerful he's created but what is Divinity and and I thought about that and and maybe share a little bit about that you know but one one God hallelujah amen and and we see that when he Express that because that's important as we're going to go into this in a moment something that was lost but was found again and we've got it Hallelujah that's the great thing amen talk about what about in the 1840s or something the Gold Rush we've got the gold today amen we certainly got it Hallelujah and two witness you know uh the two is always the number of witness amen uh and the two witnesses that are to come and brother Bram was almost jumping like that when he said when I saw that he said he said it's not one it's alleah and Moses amen two he says coming and he said that was a real blessing that's the only time that the two came together that's how important it is to the Jewish people Amen in the Great Tribulation amen and so and the three which is a beautiful number the most beautiful number I I sometimes I would just use a Sunday morning and preach these things to my people and maybe I we're talking about the first SE I did that not long ago of got and you know and there's a lot when you read them things there's a lot there praise God and and tree the Perfection amen the three offices cuz it is three is divine Perfection that's that's his Perfection amen and his three offices amen and uh amen it's the first of the the perfect numbers one of them uh three and seven and 10 and 12 and if you multiply them all together you end up with 200 2,520 and that is the time of the dispersia across the world and then praise God that is the time of the Gentiles and we these are all all gone now the dispersia is over the dentil times virtually 99% over and praise God so these are all important amen and uh but you could say a lot about that you could make a message I've got it uh but but it's beautiful and and for the Earthly number amen you know I heard somebody say one time when as a young boy he says never get so Heavenly mind that that your feet is not on the ground amen so some people can have their head in the sky but that's not a good thing not all the time amen so praise God but four is the Four Winds amen uh the Earthly the four horsen that are Unleashed on the earth it comes on the earth Hallelujah and of course the four seasons of your year amen your uh H H your your your winter and summer and Springtime and harvest amen it's just so beautiful Hallelujah that God said I'll never break that that cycle will never be broken and When God says it you can rest your soul on it because it will come to pass it has to come to pass so praise the Lord and and and and the five I'm not going to say much about them just to to bring it to your cuz you got to keep your numbers right amen and five that unmerited favor of God that wondrous Grace I learned a little hym years ago and it was wondrous Grace it reaches me it reaches me right down where where where I couldn't even reach myself he reached down his hand for me amen for me Hallelujah I was lost on undone without God on a son until he reached down his hand hand for me amen well wonderful just wonderful and and and of course six Adam was created on the sixth day we know that and uh praise the Lord and of course the Antichrist comes 666 uh yeah and and what happens then man trying to take the place of God that's all that's what it comes to that point that man is God Amen there's a lot of people believe that they believe that they he the and what are they they go down to the Grave like like all the other people amen praise God yes absolutely Hallelujah no amen I just go on I was nearly going to venture out there but I'm pulling it back Hallelujah seven the spiritual Perfection oh my spiritual Perfection is that wonderful if God would call you that spiritually perfected people because you're a seven you've got you're the last age that's on this Earth amen there's not eight ages seven Church ages perfect Perfection spiritual and completion it's done hallelujah amen and and when we think about that that that uh three three and seven amen and and God created the world in seven days and a day we know it's with the ages we'll get that to later because it's in the notes but the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals and spiritual completion and Perfection Amen to us and and and this is the the the what we're walking in in these times Hallelujah this is what we're walking in the truth of them amen and the blessing of them amen and you notice that if you look at seven and you've got three plus 4 uhh and there you've joined your spiritual Perfection Amen to your spiritual completion amen God's part the three your part on the earth four and here we have seven and we're still here wanting to go amen praise God you know somebody said h h h you know are you looking for a great Revival all over the world I said we're looking for the coming of the Lord that's what we're looking for amen hallelujah praise God so hallelujah and amen and that that first part that is that Divinity of God when I got thinking about that boy it blessed my soul I've got a whole message on it on the Divinity uh and all the things you know we sing a song and said you know it well love divine all lovees excelling amen and and we know that and Divinity actually speaks of the person of of let me read it like this here to you amen there is only one Divine person amen only one and that's him there praise God hallelujah and you say well what about this you can't divide them Hallelujah that's the that's the only Divine person there is amen he was divine at the tomb of Lazareth brother Bram says yes he was a man he could weep amen and calling Lazarus back to this old world Amen oh my I wouldn't call my wife back to this old world for all the all the money in the world I would not do it praise God and we're trying to get out not get come in come in amen hallelujah and and and Jesus Christ truly God and mind and the divinity is the distinctive nature uh uh or Essence of God what he is that's the Divinity amen what he is and it's a funny thing if I never give this uh to to to to Joe but in in one Romans where it talked about that the the the the heavens up there declare his eternal godhead and that word godhead there is a is translated Divinity so sh is Divinity hallelujah praise God he's a Divine amen it's wonderful Hallelujah and that Divinity has been given to the church you say well how would that be brother George you know you never when you talk about deity you never say uh Divine deity like you never use that but you do use that term Divine for divine love Divine Healing is that what we call it Divine Healing amen because it's showing the essence of what he is hallelujah and praise God uh the Divine Authority that he gives us I'm going to speak a little bit about that in a moment and the divine revelation it's it's divine it has to come from that one person and that's Jesus Christ himself that's why the life that I I live I live it by that faith of Jesus Christ amen and me Christ liveth in me amen so Hallelujah now and and and you can go right into it and whatnot the the the the the the new beginning isn't it wonderful and and you know folks scripture cannot be broken I I don't care anybody can come and say this that or the other scripture cannot be broken if God said it Hallelujah God will do it amen and so Hallelujah there's going to be a n day there's going to be another spring we'll be in a millennium but we will also go into the Eternal day what a day that will be amen and I can't wait there to to see that Crystal uh sea or Crystal water flowing clean pure and and what a place that will be all together we'll just cannot fathom what that's going to be like amen praise God and he has revealed it to us because John being our type he had a tour amen I love that you know you go over to is somebody take you on a tour around all the places this happened here that but you know I'll tell you what John got a tour of the of the New Jerusalem Hallelujah and thank God we've had a tour of it too amen the future home and uh brother we was telling me he' been speaking about that too well we speak about everything I think over this last many years we've covered nearly everything is to cover but praise God as regard what's there but it's getting into the the the ethos of at night it's getting into the power of at night the authority of at night and we'll talk about that just in a moment nine and the gifts of the Spirit amen so praise the Lord and and and 10 or or didn't what God ordains to be to rule us like the Ten Commandments and you know these things and I was thinking about these things you got to keep them right amen and the 24 Elders that the 12 of Apostles of the lamb and and the sons of of of uh Jacob amen of Israel you got to put them together the 24 there they are amen and we've got the revelation of it and that's so important I want to speak uh just in a few moments about two of my favorite quotes now this is the way the Lord led me that's why I'm going this way but but uh just in a moment and so praise God when we think about that and and these scriptures cannot be broken they're there Hallelujah right now and so praise the Lord and you know something I want to say this as well that you know I'm not trying to stand here and tell you what I know oh that fellow he knows a lot doesn't he because that would not be my purpose amen praise the Lord uh uh God forbid that but what I am trying to do is tell you I know whom I have believed I know him Hallelujah let you many of you here know him really as much as I do amen we know whom we have believed and are persuaded we're convinced Hallelujah that he is able to keep that which I've my whole life Brother D my whole life committed onto him against that day there's going to be a day coming Hallelujah and I'll tell you we'll all stand there and and our works will we all tried but oh my goodness everything that's done for Jesus will last amen and and and and you know it's wonderful that you might say well uh could you tell me all you've done I forgot 95% maybe of what I've done but I'll tell you what I know there's somewhere somebody didn't forget Hallelujah so we leave that with the Lord amen no amen okay Hallelujah now I I had two favorite quotes and and there really are person personal and it would make me H you know I get so thrilled I've still got I've never lost that from I was a young man in the ministry I never lost that Amy man there still an 18y old in here all right brother with you know praise God something that you know the body Can't Jump the way you used to the body can't do what you used to do like you know I was up there painting at the wall you know and wo I was glad to get finished you know you know and that's it see but but two two of my favorite quotes and I want to give them to you cuz they mean so much to me and and I'm sure to some of you young people here today they'll mean something all of us amen and I love this uh in in the ludan church head's book it's the uh the book chapter 9 amen there uh where brother BR made this statement and I love it that's why uh brother Joe might shoot it on here malikai 4 he said now this Minister this messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 you can't split them up you just can't pull them apart amen you cannot do it Hallelujah and so uh it's going to do two things two things what one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers man we understand that to be we're the children turn our hearts back to the Pentecostal fathers yeah we understand that amen and two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 amen which are the Revelation contained in the Seven Seals now that's what he said and I love Simplicity praise God I love Simplicity when God just says it like that so you don't need to worry what's these is there seven more Thunders or anything that's exactly what he said that's exactly what he meant amen you know the arish people consider themselves playing speaking people amen and and you always say what you mean and you always mean what you say amen and that's the best way to do it so he meant what he said here praise God and and and amen it says it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that will literally literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers amen amen no and and I'm I'm not bragging or boasting but I can tell you one thing when I get the glory and somebody out to the first church I says Oh Brother Quinn it's great to see you here amen and and and what did you do for the Lord and and in our day we saw healings all the time and we saw the mighty hand of God doing Miracles I say amen and so did I so did I hallelujah praise God Amen because our hearts have been turned back we've got the same spirit that Paul had I said it many often times brother we that you know in in the church and Paul was sitting there be Amen in the word amen in the word hallelujah praise God he wouldn't be sitting there I'd Haven him preach him but you know what I mean hallelujah praise God to see my brother Bram have you there he just Amen in the word I enjoyed that that's good you were right there you kept it straight Hallelujah and so it's wonderful and and just think about that today young people your heart has literally been changed back there's been a change in your heart back to what they had at Pentecost hallelujah amen woo I remember we were over we were I was over in uh Myanmar and um we we we we actually from popet you could uh take a place a little flight and it dangerous cuz it's going through the valleys you know and there was an N crash in it not long ago and um we went up to a place where the big prison was but it was also a tourist attraction place so we were there and that night it rained hard and when we arrived the pastor was brushing out the the water out of the the the basement and and that night the people came and they came in like a tractor and and a trailer and they were all on it and then there was another one and that's how they came now I of I often wondered about that you know is this like R the crowd have but it's not R to cred hallelujah it's as as many as wanted to come that could get on was there Hallelujah and I tell you what I'm sure they were glad they were there because uh at the end of that service and this woman there was there about a 14-year-old girl I think uh her age was and and I still got her testimony wrote down and wow uh when I went down and was praying for the people she said this girl uh her daughter she said she's deaf she can't hear nothing she's completely St deaf and I said well I pray for her sister and I prayed for her and nothing happened she just looked at me and nothing happened and she couldn't hear nothing and I said well that's that's that's fine amen I said um I just I want to apologize that we should have the power and I'm going to talk about that in a moment but we should have the power but uh amen and and that was it so we moved on prayed for that well the next night and I was only there two nights the next night uh that girl her mother brought her again into the par so I looked down and I said well my that's faith I love that you know something about prayer can I just throw this in here right now to you something about prayer you could have been praying I'm sure some of you have been praying for years year in year out about thing maybe it's a l one anything and you're praying or maybe about yourself something that you would like God to do and all them prayer seems to just hit the ceiling and back and you're never going to get an answer but well well Zachariah was like that in the temple he was exactly like God and and and Gabriel says and your wife will conceive and your prayer is here that's what he says he said what prayer like would you be talking about you know I mean you know come on let's get real here what what are you on about and he said you're going to have a child oh no I don't believe that that was maybe a couple of years back 10 years May yeah I don't believe that he said okay you don't believe it will you'll be de or dumb until until the de happens amen cuz I've come from God to tell you this message and and and amen so so God can hear the first day you can pray a thing it may take 15 years to answer answer but I'll tell you what the first day you pray it was heard in heaven you find out with Daniel you find out in the Book of Daniel okay and and that's the way it is amen and and I love this here may I just know this and before I get onto that other quote he said but could consider this also this Prophet Prophet Messenger will be in his nature and manners as were Elijah and John Elijah the tishbite and John the Baptist the people of this Prophet Messengers day will be as they were in Abraham's day and in John's day absolutely absolutely surrounded by unbelief amen praise God it's always going to be that way and I remember one guy I seen him there not long ago but I just didn't get a chance to talk to him and he's a kind of a he does this music and he said one day he singing which not sorry he wrote an article and it was nothing to do with anything that he was talking about he said and the people that believe and know in dark and all that that bunk them and all that there I said well I'd love to talk to you one day about it I'd love to talk to you about it because God said it happened sence has even tell him it happened that's not going to convince an unbeliever that ain't going to convince no you heard our brother this morning speaking about that that won't confess an unbeliever amen praise God but listen to this amen so as it were in ahab's day we we talked about the yesterday we just what we're talking about everything yesterday and praise God we're talking about the the seven Messengers in the Old Testament Church amen and they are there Hallelujah and praise God and it says uh and since it's only only the children whose Hearts will be turned right it's only the children who will listen right there you go folks there you go amen praise God and uh the best you can do is just hand it out do what you say and let it the rest with the Lord amen and witness and your life is a witness I know that so wonderful and then could I just go on this very fast amen uh brother BR said the church has labored against sin for 6,000 years true enough and one time you'd say but brother George did you ever see an angel couple of times I could say probably probably but one time I was over in Scotland and I just down at the grass Market below the castle in edenburgh uh uh that's where they used to hang the people to disagree with the system at the time and uh so people PA with their lives well you know there was nice no nice funeral homes in all in them days you were thrown onto a cart taken up up the little Hill and uh and you were just thrown into a pit covered over and that was that and so now they have a a monument to that and it was all kind of gray over when I was there and I was reading it about how these men sacrificed their life for the cause of Christ and um and and I I said um and I salute you today Hallelujah and something said behind me amen and I I I look right and I seen this fell here with black hair bit taller than I was amen with a white ging coat on and and so I turned back and and I'm just thinking you know couple of seconds more so I turned around to talk to him and he wasn't there I thought hold on a minute you couldn't even had the time to walk up to that door that church way up there so where did you go I looked everywhere for him couldn't find him amen so praise God it happens and the church has labored against sin in the oage they went to there's a man I want to meet where he could have uh kissed that little l or did what he had to do for the Romans and they said oh you're you're okay you go but he wouldn't do it he said I am a Christian and they got him right into the arena in Rome and and they said now all you got to do is bow down to this little thing here and take it or whatever you did and and you can go out your life saved and he said I am a Christian and they sacrificed him it cost him his life that day well I want to shake his hand one day and said I was blessed by your testimony hallelujah amen I was blessed by your testimony praise God okay so we've been laboring it hasn't been easy praise God but it's glorious it's a glorious path Hallelujah and uh I'm glad I can look back and that and I'm so glad amen and uh thank the Lord and the 7,000th is the Millennium and the Millennium I preached on this the memorials of God in church in our own church the memorials of God and her joa cross the river Jord and they set up the stones and you know the memorials of God and and Samuel Rising the Ebenezer the stone of help Hallelujah he's a help folks today to you a present help in time of trouble and God knows I can take that box amen hallelujah and so here he is a memorial the Millennium that thousand years of Peace will be a memorial to all creation that God has redeemed his church hallelujah amen we'll look around and we'll be enjoying that and say God has redeemed his church and here we are what a glorious thing I love that amen when when he lets a man live through a thousand years it's a type in Memorial no man in the Old Testament lived a thousand years but I'll tell you what we'll live more longer than that amen praise God with eternal life in us and and so it's wonderful a type of an immemorial that he will never more destroy man Hallelujah and there will be never no more sin you're going to be looking for that no more unbelief amen you're not going to meet anybody over there says I don't believe it praise God they're not going to be there question it because you've come through the whole thing and you're there amen and and he said we're at it right now amen praise the Lord so amen hallelujah yeah we're right there now that would lead us on to something else because this is a very important thing for us all today that we've had a change from this message has done one wonderful thing many wonderful things but one of the Glorious things that it did is it acknowledged the supremacy the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ that this is a no second person this is the person of God hallelujah and the Supreme deity he said brother Bram said it's the greatest of all Revelations amen he that's what he said it's the deity the Supreme deity of our Lord Jesus Christ you can't get to first base now I know but I I I was at a a baseball match up there with brother Ron Spencer and uh I think it was his nephew or something was playing the baseball for the the school and we went to see it and I learned more lessons that night about I didn't know really but I learned some lessons you know and I know one thing if you hit that ball right and goes right of the out of the stadium well you got a home run baby it you know amen so I learned that much praise God and and of course you got your popcorn and all that there but I'd never bother with that that wasn't amen hallelujah and so he said you'll never get rid of first Beast Until you realize that that this that is supreme deity speaking to you every day amen and and taking the time to speak to you every day Hallelujah and so the first of all Revelations amen and you must know I'm going to spend a little bit of time here but not much but you must know who he is and when you hear his voice that's it like Samuel you know Samuel didn't know who it was and and and and and and Eli says no go lie down and he call him again he didn't still know and and the third time Eli was spiritual enough to realize look there more than just man here he said the next time he speak say Speak Lord for thy servant and that's your theop that's what he was standing on cuz the Lord stood there amen praise God he wasn't an invisible God at that moment he was in a theophany and he speaks to Samuel all what was going to happen amen and the same voice sounded on Mount Sinai the same V voice sounded on the Mount of transfiguration uh the same one one like onto the son of man amen right there in Revelation 1 and what is it it was the revelation of the Supreme deity amen being God himself no Hallelujah and you know where where where brother brandham talked about the in the church ages about uh Luther's time you know that was a wonderful move of God in Luther's time but the trouble was with his move is that so many just wanted to leave the Catholic Church get out of it they seen the Ridiculousness and there's people that got uh still moving out of it amen a lot of Catholics in Ireland have been shaken to the core about what they were doing with the children so amen and so uh a lot of them just left to do that and and not because they had a spiritual uh H uh thing with God no they just left with the rest amen it was the thing to do get out of that Blackness and and and you know and and it says that a brother Bram here he quotes it he says amen that he says that uh you have a name that you live but you're dead amen what a thing to say you have a name that you live amen praise God but you're dead right Hallelujah well he doesn't say that to this age he talks about the the lyan uh uh day amen lukewarmness in the churches and all that but not of the Bride Hallelujah he's talking to the Overcomers here you know and if you read the book of of uh The Song of Solomon come away my love my fair one my do that's not the Ludy in church AG that's the bride in the ludan church AG amen and so we're we're so thankful amen and and and and you know that was why why was that the god brother George because that's when they lost the deity of Jesus Christ they lost the name Hallelujah and they did it they did it and brought in a tri God at the Council of n that's what they did now the thing about it is this amen praise God uh uh to lose the name what they had I remember I I I I I had the book and you still get it on the internet today on the life of Columbo by adaman and adaman at that beginning of that book he says greetings in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and that's the way he's writing the book and I think wow that's wonderful cuz you have not denied his name but amen before his life was ended and the Romans had made so much uh and Ina into Britain amen they got him to a point where they got him to change Easter and they got him to a point where he denied the name and he went to father son Holy Ghost well I'll tell you when he went back up to Iona how Hallelujah a lot of the monster wouldn't going to have that amen said if Columba taught it it was right and we believe it and you can go and do whatever you want but we're staying with what he said well that's that's wonderful but the name was lost amen it was lost Hallelujah and and the thing about it is amen hallelujah uh right here at this age praise God here comes out the name of Jesus again in between these anges ages uh the open door where he came up when he seen the one sitting on the throne you show me any place in this scripture where there's more than one sitting on the throne I've never read it and I've read the Bible a couple of times good couple of times I've never read there's two sitting on the throne amen and the one that will be there will be his bride amen praise God beside him but but here amen and and John saw I'm standing there at the seven candlesticks and my and he says I am Alpha I am the beginning and I am the end hallelujah what you see John my Divinity here today the Supreme deity of who am amen will be restored again it was lost at the beginning it will be restored again and it was restored in our day amen it came to us hallelujah praise the Lord yeah the light rises in the East and s in the west it's been dismal dark time but it shall be light in the evening time and that's one of the lights that come out of it that Supreme deity and I want to show you how important that is amen praise God and then we're going to go on to the the the the Highlight amen I'm watching the time amen so praise God way back then I am he that was which is and which is to come I am the first and the last I am elsh I am the almighty amen he said it three different times there's his Divine Perfection three different times amen and praise God uh making himself deity to the first church before he went into the last age and my could you imagine John Wesley believeing I was over there in London and I said to the pastor I said I've never been to where John Wesley had his church and that there where he's buried and all he said I'll take you so he did and and it was beautiful because in that place and they used to go away upstairs you know right up to the pulpit and he was nearly could preach to the people on the balcony he was nearly that high up but he was a small man he was a really small man he's been smaller than me and and uh and and you could see his clothes just you know a teenager already get into them last small and and uh amen and there he was and he had a little hat there and I touched it and say oh don't do that I said I'm sorry I'm sorry CU it was one of his real hats that he wore amen was it was just awesome and uh we went around all that and we went into his little bed chamber very humble amen and lovely like God and then she said and this is this little prayer closet here where he used to come and study and pray and and we went in and she turned around and she said to me would you like to pray that's said a sure word amen praise God to walk in the the steps of that man amen and we did pray and it was a wonderful day and we went outside where he was buried and I asked was he uh you know when you get um what do you call it uh uh the embomb you amen I said he emomed said no he's not inomed and I said uh where where where is uh his brother amen uh Charles buried and he says oh Charles wouldn't be buried here she says Charles had to be buried in one of the Church of England places the consecrated ground amen well folks you don't care about the consecrated ground don't matter where you're buried you ask the Apostle Paul cuz within 5 minutes have been cast into that pit he was standing in the presence of God with his head back on again hallelujah amen just wonderful Hallelujah so it it came back in the last age amen and brother Bram says uh what he said Upon This Rock I'll build my church who do you say that I am well you're one of the Trinity Lord you know no he said thou the Christ the son of the Living God and he said flesh and blood has not revealed revealed not but my Father in Heaven has revealed that to you Peter and all that you've got today has been Revelation to you amen it had to come to you you had to see it hallelujah amen I I I it's it's it's nice to say well I believe what my pastor believes but I mean you have to experience what your pastor experienced as well what he's preaching so amen and there it was amen and that's that's so much of it there is so so precious amen and uh what was he going to do amen what was he going to do Hallelujah he was going to build his church on this revelation of who he is and he's done it Hallelujah he's done it and the bride amen and he said I love that song down from his glory

Sunset mountain and the sunset light the evening L has come God Vindicated himself amen the facts that God and Christ are one amen that white W grown them was the very Angels themselves he says wonderful Hallelujah and we love them we love that Revelation amen and he uh right in that mind dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily oh my we we we could we could say it I was thinking there you know I I love when even today I might I just see how the Lord leads us today but you know when when when Jesus was going to be baptized brother Bram says and he walked along the path with Lazarus his friend the both of them went together you know that wonderful that a prophet could look back and see amen could look back and see that see Adam and Eve leaving Garden of Eden amen and and some of the stories he tells you you can see he's seeing it right there cuz he's a Seer a prophet a Seer amen and and so it's wonderful hallelujah how how it all comes amen no Hallelujah okay now praise the Lord um amen okay so if that Divine deity that he's going to build his church on Amen this is a little handful on purpose for you this is a little handful on purpose for you amen for Ruth this morning amen when she gleamed in the field amen and praise God see they left little handfuls on purpose and she come oh my Hallelujah I mean you don't get them every day but my goodness God gives you when you need them a little handful on purpose something special he does something nice for you Hallelujah now Moses was given a rod amen a judgment rod and he went down right there from the from when I threw it down there right in the burning bush and turned to a serpent and he picked it up again by the tail which I wouldn't advise anybody to do but God told him to do it and as you heard the brother saying today even if a donkey talks to you and he tells you the truth just believe what he told you cuz it's the truth amen so and here he was he he obeyed that voice and he went down there amen and uh the Egyptians had they known uh they would have taken it off him and that's right then what what like Samson in his hair see they didn't know until he give to Delilah amen the bad thing folks and you young people here amen don't ever get married to somebody because you look at their looks amen I can show you as matter of fact I'm going to leave some photographs out and you'll see when I was young and my wife were young and the kids were sitting on her knees I'm going to leave them out today that you can see some of the little photographs that I brought over but listen you never marry because of looks now that could be a first attraction that you like a person to see that's okay but M has to be character it has to be someone that's going to love you amen someone that's going to we know that you loved your wife you know that went all over the south of dony G amen people even last Friday I was talking to a man and he telling me about how good I was to my wife and she passed away in March that was Friday there before I came over here amen I tell you it's just wonderful and what a testimony praise God you did really love her didn't you amen I sure did and I still love her Hallelujah I still wear the wedding B amen I'm not going to marry anybody else I've got one wife Hallelujah and I'll tell you what I can't wait to be joined with her amen absolutely okay so but you know the world always miss it you know when bam in his time I'm going as fast as I can but I'll get there amen we made a deal so we'll keep that but you know in Bam's time that's what convinced him to to go ahead with the big party he said surely these people look at them down there in Israel that couldn't be the the the promised people of God and looking on the outward appearance you see an old person like got surely That Couldn't what they could that old fell do amen but I'll tell you what Hallelujah he missed it Baum missed it Hallelujah for they were because the shirt of the King was in the camp and if there's any shirt of the King today it's in the Bride of Jesus Christ R the world R the world Amen Hallelujah and and and you know my my my daughter was in over in Canada there and and and again even when the sisters came from Canada at one time they said that's just exactly the same in our church Same Spirit same of course it is cuz we're exactly the same family we're exactly the same bride amen and he's ministering he's not ministering to one greater than another one or Sat one up higher than another one we're all the family of God the saints of God and the Bride of Jesus Christ amen and I love that and so here he was and and they missed it the Egyptians missed it the the Philistines missed it with Samson that his hair grew again amen and three times woo three times Moses raised that Rod Hallelujah and they didn't know what was happening they didn't know and you know when when it's a wonderful thing I'm not going to talk about the devil today but but woo amen there's only about times in the Bible that he's actually recorded as saying anything but you know amen we're not going to talk to him today but he he missed this he didn't know it was going on and when when brother Bram could look at you people and say the devil doesn't know what to do with you he can't handle you Hallelujah you've overcome him he knows you beat him Hallelujah he knows it he walks back there and said to all them demons they can't Lord we can't do it we can't break through that bloodline we can't break through that Holy Ghost amen and and it's wonderful so I I think that's a wonderful thing for to be told that the devil doesn't know what to do with me I'm sure he doesn't done tried many things you know praise God but Hallelujah and three times it's recorded bringing the plagues over the egyptions my raise up your Rod over that and and strike the river or whatever amen and and and he did it Hallelujah and something happened amen and uh then praise God when josa was fighting amen sorry when they crossed the Red Sea again don't cry speak just raise up that Rod again and tell them to go forward Hallelujah not backward forward Hallelujah and so there then when josa fought the amalekites and and he would had the rod up and he got he was older getting tired and so they got a rock s him on it and held up his hands while that Rod was there and the victory was given three times it's recorded that he did that there amen no Hallelujah and the Victory came and when he did that the final Victory but listen to this amen we've got a rod far greater than what Moses ever had we have got the name restored back to us the name of the Lord Jesus Christ restored back to us hallelujah and that'll do more than raising the Lord over anything but but that was God's way but now we've got the name and we don't use it enough Hallelujah we don't find the devil enough brother Ram says amen and we shoot because not let them get the victory over you Hallelujah no Hallelujah and so what a what a thing amen the Roman came and said to uh I said to Jesus now uh when when jarus came he said come and lay your hands on my daughter amen but when the Centurion came he recognized something and it's good to recognize hallelujah amen you know I didn't finish that story about the little deaf girl because on the second night when she was there I looked down and I said my that's that's faith and I went down and you know you know the scripture says it that Faith worketh by love and it means it it really means it Faith does work by love and and I looked down and I said well that's amazing that death girl and her mama's brought it again tonight well I'll go down and pray again tonight Hallelujah only this time it was different amen as I went up to that girl started to pray for her hallelujah amen what happened was I could feel a lovely sweetness come down and a love that went out amen for this child that was stricken in this way Hallelujah and I'll tell you what when we prayed for her amen and just as I finished praying she let her yell hallelujah amen and and and she run out of the place and I never knew it till a red brother R him on it amen he said that's what happens sometimes they've never heard for years and years or whatever maybe from birth I don't know but it wasn't me that opened her ears praise the Lord but by just giving the gift of faith Hallelujah and I'll tell you what folks you know when them things happen you don't need to wait for the Holy Ghost to come down he'll fall and he fell in all the people and people were falling all over the place he said did you do that no I did not do that I was only there I seen it in Africa too I was only there when it happened amen and it was wonderful amen and and and and I I better go on I'll just leave that there can say a little more but I won't amen so praise God and that lovely name to have it amen what a name amen praise God in my name you shall cast it as a matter of fact the Bible says not only cast out devils and and I've done it many times amen but uh and and seen the sick heal from it but I'll tell you what amen the Bible says this and how could anybody believe in anything else when it says everything you do do all in the name of Jesus Christ now what that that's kind of Nar we better there don't it Hallelujah so you can't do nothing you can't receive your your drink of water you can't do nothing other than in the name of Jesus Christ amen and of course we know uh that is who the father Son and Holy Ghost is amen but that was to be a test for them amen no and so praise the Lord but when that Roman came he had Authority and he knew it amen and he said I can say that Soldier yep and he said now you speak Lord it'll happen and he said I've never found greater Faith No so that's where we're at we've got that name oh my what a wonderful thing amen you know I just say this very quickly brother because some of you may heard this and some of you might have brother Bram was over in Germany and there was a a Guang of wizards or whatever you call them and anyway and so this head Wizard or whatever he kind of thought well we're going to have some Sport with this American evangelist and so he challenged him amen uh to prove his power and so he said now I'm going to do something here and I want you to undo it and brother B I'm listening very carefully mhm and he lifted the table off the floor he lifted the table off the floor and he said now can you get it done and brother son looked at him and said M yeah yeah he said well and the name of William Bram come down nothing happened oh my what a smirk on his face see just another another just one of these guys yeah big talk you know all wind no sails and he said okay he said well in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost come down nothing happened and know he was really smiling ey amen but then that Prophet you could just imagine him if you could see what it would be like he would just get real and the hers in his face would stand out and he would just tilt over and he would just turn around without Authority and he would say in the name of Jesus Christ come down Hallelujah and that table hit the floor so hard and nearly broke it amen there's the power that's what you've got never be afraid to use that name everything Lord I ask it in the name of of Jesus Christ amen so Hallelujah no and uh amen this coming up to the end now uh but I want to just say this I might go on later I don't I'm not 100% sure about that but because the life that I I live you can go right back to the beginning where right into the mind of God Amen and the life you're living now was all done then everything was done then hallelujah in the mind of God Amen the Eternal mind of God got there the answer I may never know but I'll tell you I know I was there that's all I know amen that's all you need to know praise God Amen praise the Lord yeah yeah so amen here he was a Paul the great Apostle and man of God wrote these words no doubt thinking uh uh no doubt at all he was thinking of his own life a Pharisee of the Pharisees sat under gel would have Rose High to ranks in the organization of the Pharisees and one day just one day and one moment in that day his life was changed forever amen I had the pleasure of and it's off the Beaten Track it's not on the the tourist Trail you can go to the marmatan prison and you can go right down the wooden stairs and right down to the big cave where they had Paul in incarcerated amen down there and no wonder he could say to Timothy bring the cloak and and and a little C candle and and some some parchment amen it wasn't easy but he said I'm not ready to be offered I'm ready to go and there is a crown amen waiting for me I used to have a little badge here where there was a crown on a cross inside it amen I don't know how I probably get my suit clean one day and I I i' I've misplaced it but my I believe that with all my heart no cross No Cry amen the praise of suffering the praise of sympathy when people come and say look we're sorry this is happening to you that's the price of suffering you only get sympathy when you suffering amen and so praise the Lord here he was amen and what happened that day was what happened to you and I of maybe all of us I hope so but where we met the Lord where we met the Lord and here he was on the Damascus Road breathing out utterings and what he was going to do and he was going to destroy them and he he'd do it for the Pharisees in Jerusalem bringing them all back in Chains and whatever amen but he met that Pillar of Fire and that Pillar of Fire always identifies itself I am Jesus who you are persecuting amen what a change and he's off the ground he's lying there and the

American far company there in in Ireland and he's never asked and he's went to all those countries but we've always always Tred to help him to go he's never asked for anything at all nothing but dad's always been faithful to give brother George some little extra cash cuz them two million 2 and a half million miles I hope you got frequent flyer miles but that cost a lot of money so the why I'm saying this is I asked him yesterday I said brother George now that everything's kind of settled down and he can get out I said do you want to travel again he said brother waade I have a desire to travel again if as long as he can okay as long as he can so as a church if you don't mind will'll give him some some funds to do that with if he's go ready to go back then we're going to we're going to help just like brother Dale did we're going to help fund that brother George so you just let you just let brother Terrence know or sister Lisa and and he's never he didn't even know I was going to say this but that's the reason I asked him yesterday I said you want to travel again cuz I'm telling you he's had a lot of done a lot of work in in a lot of small places like Vietnam uh Thailand Thailand Cambodia Cambodia Myanmar all the different Indonesia yes Indonesia and he he he says he had a desire to go back to the Philippines also so we're going to pray about that number one and then then brother George if you need the funds we'll we'll get you some funds to go okay we sure will cuz he's retired now and um and he's uh living on living on his Social Security kind of social security so more than enough more than enough okay well we're going to give you a little extra so you just you just see brother Terrence and and uh and then do what we usually do amen but we brother listen he works when he goes he works and I like a man that works for a living and then does I know you get to a time and place where a pastor doesn't need to work cuz he's got a lot of work to do but brother
