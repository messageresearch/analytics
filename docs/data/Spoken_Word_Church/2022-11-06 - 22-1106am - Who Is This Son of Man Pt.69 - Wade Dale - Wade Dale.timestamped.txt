[28:08] always wins a race in that book I have
[28:10] never read that book where the hair ever
[28:12] won the turtle won the race every time
[28:15] even when I was a little kid mom would
[28:16] read it to me the turtle one I read into
[28:19] my granddaughter the turtle one and yes
[28:21] there were books when I was a little kid
[28:23] okay sorry
[28:26] hmm
[28:28] she here
[28:30] yes Josiah's girlfriend's here okay your
[28:33] mama June up here taking care of you
[28:35] when your real Mama's not here good to
[28:37] have you here sister Watkins
[28:40] talk about her daddy and she's back
[28:42] there oh boy
[28:43] good to have you I didn't say I didn't
[28:45] say you about that but good to have you
[28:46] with us so let's read the scripture and
[28:48] be seated but we're on the topic of who
[28:50] is this son of man and we've started
[28:52] this series 69 weeks ago and we haven't
[28:56] even got to the first virtue yet so but
[28:59] we're trying to get a foundation and
[29:01] today we're going to talk a little bit
[29:02] more about that Foundation but we're
[29:04] looking at the scripture and John once
[29:06] and then the beginning was the word the
[29:08] word was with God and the Word was God
[29:10] and the Word was made in your flesh
[29:14] two thousand years ago is good that's
[29:17] fine but if he's not coming your flesh
[29:20] amen then he came for naught
[29:23] he came so that what you and I could be
[29:25] his victory you and I could be his glory
[29:27] amen and the Word was made flesh so
[29:29] let's not take two thousand years ago
[29:31] we're going to take it today and dwelt
[29:34] Among Us that's the you that's why I
[29:35] said shake your hand shake the hand to
[29:37] God
[29:38] I'm not worthy well
[29:41] the Bible says you are amen amen like
[29:44] brother John said the whole the whole
[29:46] program's been right here the whole time
[29:48] right here amen no self-help book we
[29:51] don't need Joel Olsteen or somebody tell
[29:53] us how to live better we need the Bible
[29:55] amen and the Word was made flesh and
[29:58] Goth among us and we behold his glory
[29:59] which is today the glory of the only
[30:02] begotten of the father full of grace and
[30:03] truth go ahead and be seated and we'll
[30:04] read these first Thessalonians 4 verse 4
[30:07] says that every one of you
[30:10] should know look how positive that is
[30:12] should know how to possess his vessel
[30:15] now not your neighbors not your wife Not
[30:17] Your Daughters not your neighbor yours
[30:20] how to possess your vessel in
[30:23] sanctification
[30:24] and honor Romans 12 verse 2 says be not
[30:27] conformed to this world that's what
[30:29] we've been talking about for the past
[30:31] few weeks and we'll continue on a little
[30:32] bit more
[30:33] and I want to speak maybe next Sunday on
[30:35] a topic that's maybe a little bit
[30:37] strange but but it all connects together
[30:39] but the power of a thought
[30:42] think of the power of a thought because
[30:44] what brother Brown say he said it was a
[30:46] thought first
[30:48] then it became a word
[30:49] then it became expressed and the Word
[30:53] was thought of before the foundation of
[30:55] the world but that world that word
[30:57] became flesh when he spoke through
[31:00] Isaiah and said a virgin shall conceive
[31:02] and bring forth a child all right but be
[31:05] not conformed to this world but be what
[31:07] transformed
[31:09] not just turn over a new Leaf not just
[31:11] have a good thought like we're going to
[31:13] talk about next Sunday Lord with him by
[31:16] the renewing of your mind
[31:18] the Bible tells us which folks have the
[31:19] what the mind of Christ by the renewing
[31:22] of your mind because you were born this
[31:23] way
[31:24] right here with my hand you were born
[31:26] this way yes everybody in this building
[31:28] came the same way
[31:31] all right there's no secret to that
[31:32] every person except for Jesus Christ
[31:34] that ever began
[31:38] by desire everybody with me all right so
[31:41] you've got to have a renewing of that
[31:43] carnal mind because that carnal mind is
[31:45] what it's enmity it's a division between
[31:48] you and God that God put there that's
[31:51] right
[31:52] but God had a plan pray to God God had a
[31:55] plan and a purpose
[31:56] the prophet of God told us and he sent
[31:58] us a prophet to make that purpose not
[32:00] different
[32:01] to but to make it more clear than any
[32:04] other person ever brought on the face of
[32:06] the third they never understood Jesus
[32:07] Christ
[32:09] because they didn't have the new birth
[32:11] so I said we spent so many of those 69
[32:14] sermons probably what 50 of them was on
[32:17] you must be born again
[32:19] you're right because brother Brown said
[32:20] you got to be born again not in your
[32:22] spirit but in your soul right you gotta
[32:25] what by the renewing of your mind that
[32:27] you may want that you may prove yes yeah
[32:30] you may prove
[32:32] it's in your lap now we know God's
[32:34] infinite we know he's Eternal we know he
[32:35] never makes a mistake we know he never
[32:37] never had a bad thought what about me
[32:39] and you
[32:40] he's going to transfer that to me and
[32:41] you and if we have the mind of Christ
[32:43] we're supposed to think like god wow
[32:46] prove what is that good and acceptable
[32:49] and perfect will of God Matthew 12 34
[32:52] we'll get to these a little bit later
[32:54] old Generation of Vipers how can ye
[32:57] being evil speak good things for out of
[33:00] the abundance of the heart
[33:05] all right out of the abundance of the
[33:07] heart
[33:08] the mouth speaketh
[33:10] your thoughts come from your listen your
[33:13] thoughts do not originate in your brain
[33:16] whoa you're all enough your thoughts
[33:19] originate in that inside guy
[33:21] your brain is just a computer that you
[33:24] punched in just like you do now it's a
[33:26] hard drive you have to punch in the
[33:27] information then it spits it out and
[33:30] sometimes we do spit out some
[33:31] misinformation and everybody says amen
[33:35] all right good so I want to make sure
[33:36] we're still in this message Church
[33:38] I'll ask her several times brother Steve
[33:41] how many people believe brother Brown
[33:42] was the prophet make sure you raise your
[33:44] hand okay
[33:46] for how the abundance please do for how
[33:48] the abundance of the heart the mouth
[33:50] speaketh look a good man out of the good
[33:52] Treasure of the heart not not this thing
[33:54] that
[33:56] but the center of you the cardia we're
[33:59] going to talk about in just a minute
[34:00] before they get to work Cardiology from
[34:02] a good man out of the good treasure the
[34:04] heart bringeth forth good things an evil
[34:06] man out of the evil treasure that's
[34:08] where we were before we were born
[34:09] against everybody say Amen all of us we
[34:12] our thoughts were evil continually
[34:16] nobody with me
[34:18] now listen we may still have those evil
[34:21] thoughts oh
[34:23] if you hadn't please pray for me
[34:26] okay please pray for me
[34:28] all right
[34:30] I just don't express them like I used to
[34:32] express them before because what because
[34:35] like we were talking last Sunday that
[34:36] fountain that water has been made what
[34:39] it's not bitter anymore that Fountain is
[34:41] a Fountain of Living Water that Fountain
[34:44] is something that we want you to drink
[34:46] from that's what we're going to get to
[34:47] Virtue if we ever get to it we'll get to
[34:50] Virtue that is that fountain that
[34:51] everybody wants to drink from all right
[34:53] now the statue of perfect man brother
[34:55] I'm tells us
[34:57] so now that's the way it is trying to
[34:59] manufacture Christianity listen I don't
[35:01] want any feathers to stuck in no I want
[35:04] the eagle feathers that's already
[35:06] produced from the eagle all right if
[35:08] you've got eagle feathers and you're an
[35:10] eagle and you got eagle feathers yeah
[35:12] but if you're just chicken and you stuck
[35:14] some eagle feathers in you start coming
[35:15] to a message church and wearing your
[35:17] hair long and dressed anyway
[35:19] I don't want that
[35:22] from the abundance of the heart amen the
[35:24] mouth speaketh and you and there's one
[35:26] thing for sure for those of you that are
[35:27] visiting today I told the church first
[35:29] of the year right what did I tell you
[35:31] let it out whatever you got inside of
[35:34] you it's going to come out anyway just
[35:36] let it out whether it be bad that's okay
[35:38] if you let it out and then if it's good
[35:42] you let it out so that others can what
[35:44] drink from your fountain or can smell
[35:46] your roses or smell your Lily or
[35:48] whatever you want to say
[35:49] so the first thing you got to do is what
[35:51] be born again you got to be changed
[35:53] you're not just going to say you're not
[35:55] going to take just a mind change though
[35:57] it's a heart that's why God chose the
[36:00] heart Satan chose what the mind and
[36:03] that's what we're the greatest battle
[36:04] ever fought is is not in Warfare out
[36:07] there it's in the Battle of your mind
[36:09] because listen that's where your
[36:10] thoughts
[36:12] originate from the heart
[36:17] now here we have a chart that's what
[36:18] we've been talking about for 69 sermons
[36:21] but we started down here at the
[36:23] foundation and we believe here in this
[36:24] church that you got to be born again we
[36:27] don't believe that you came here with
[36:28] this eternal life in you
[36:34] no you came with representation
[36:37] you came with the foreknowledge thought
[36:39] of God that that seed was in the mind of
[36:41] God before the foundation of the world
[36:42] but you were born lost I was born dead
[36:46] or I didn't need Sanctified I was born
[36:48] there I didn't need Justified and I was
[36:51] born dead if I didn't need a new birth
[36:52] my first birth would have been right the
[36:53] first time that's right that's right and
[36:55] man we know those quotes we know those
[36:56] things but I want us to understand you
[36:58] were lost
[36:59] you were lost as lost could be before
[37:02] God got a hold of you and said hey be my
[37:06] child and you either what you either
[37:08] chose to be or not to be
[37:10] right amen
[37:11] and we hope today that them too say I
[37:14] will Over Yonder and I do okay that's a
[37:17] choice they're gonna have to make
[37:18] a life choice
[37:20] I like that let's get brother John one
[37:22] more hand that was good I enjoy I enjoy
[37:25] you know I uh
[37:27] me and Jim we started with Financial
[37:29] Peace a long long time ago and we taught
[37:32] some of the courses and and uh and
[37:34] they're all biblical it's not just a
[37:37] self-help book I mean it's all all
[37:38] biblical that you need to what
[37:41] you need to not be
[37:43] Laden with dead I know we do have some
[37:45] debt we've got your house payment you
[37:47] but you don't need four cars
[37:49] with four car payments everybody say
[37:51] Amen all right just want to make sure
[37:54] we're still in the same place where John
[37:55] brother John was from the same we went
[37:57] and went and switched buildings
[37:59] but but we we go back to where brother
[38:02] Branham was telling us and I just tried
[38:04] a background a little bit for the ones
[38:06] that's not been here that that we
[38:07] believe in justification sanctification
[38:09] we believe in the new birth and we
[38:11] believe that that starts at Faith not up
[38:13] here at the top of the pyramid it seals
[38:16] you more at the top of the pyramid it
[38:18] sells those virtues inside of you
[38:20] everybody with me say Amen all right and
[38:23] then brother Brown told us said that God
[38:25] came back on the day of Pentecost or
[38:27] Jesus did as the Holy Ghost most as the
[38:30] Son of God dispensation is everybody
[38:32] with me now that was the spirit gods
[38:34] that came inside those 120 in the upper
[38:37] room and gave them the new birth and
[38:39] it's been giving the new birth all the
[38:41] way up through
[38:42] the church ages but now in the end time
[38:45] we got to look at another dispensation
[38:48] change and that would be the son of man
[38:52] they didn't get the revelation of Son of
[38:53] Man the son of man stood on Earth word
[38:55] was made flesh dwelt among us there was
[38:58] The Headstone there were the seals there
[38:59] were all the all the revelation of God
[39:02] was standing in Jesus Christ right but
[39:04] he went away and came back to be the
[39:07] what foundation stone or the Cornerstone
[39:10] of the church
[39:11] but in the end time according to what
[39:13] Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 Revelation 10 7.
[39:16] God was going to come back in the end
[39:18] time and write all the wrongs because
[39:20] remember under the Son of God revelation
[39:23] there was some father-son Holy Ghost
[39:24] baptism going on
[39:27] there was some trinitarian Doctrine
[39:29] going on
[39:31] hello somebody
[39:33] but God honored that and the prophet
[39:35] said winked at their ignorance knowing
[39:37] that you and I though he's not weakening
[39:39] our ignorance today you're not ignorant
[39:42] if you've been in the message church at
[39:43] least a year you should not be ignorant
[39:45] of these trinitarian doctrines and all
[39:47] the other things that we've that we take
[39:48] for granted right so the Son of God
[39:51] Revelation could not take a body change
[39:54] there's no way you can have your body
[39:55] changed with with false Doctrine inside
[39:59] of you everybody with me
[40:02] but now the son of man Revelation I
[40:04] asked you many times before how many
[40:06] times was Jesus wrong
[40:11] how many times did he say well I didn't
[40:13] do what my father said today I think I
[40:14] just did what I wanted to do
[40:17] did he no no he said how old I only do
[40:20] that what the father tells me to do I
[40:26] owe somebody and that's what's going to
[40:28] happen to me and you we've got to
[40:30] subject our Humanity that's why we've
[40:32] got to have renewing of our mind because
[40:34] remember the virtue here on the pyramid
[40:36] is not being a virgin you'll be a virgin
[40:38] all the days of your life and die and go
[40:40] to hell
[40:42] sure you can have knowledge Temperance
[40:44] there's a lot of people that that have
[40:47] bad temper but there's a lot of people
[40:49] in this earth it's not even born again
[40:50] that you could beat them up over the
[40:52] head throw them under a truck and they
[40:53] wouldn't they just say okay because
[40:56] brother Ralph said some of these virtues
[40:59] are naturally given
[41:01] but when you get born again what's going
[41:03] to happen when you get born again you
[41:05] come under that change
[41:08] and you got to now become aware of that
[41:10] temper come on somebody listen to
[41:13] getting a new birth didn't do away with
[41:14] your temper
[41:15] if it did some of y'all needs Born Again
[41:17] get born again I said some of us I'm
[41:19] sorry some of us
[41:21] but what he's still working on me right
[41:25] but the son of man Revelation is what
[41:27] came back in the end time let's just
[41:29] bring it all back together to the
[41:31] opening of the seals because the seals
[41:34] are Jesus Christ the seals are what the
[41:36] sealing of the book of redemption it's
[41:37] opening that book so that we can read it
[41:40] and read that there was no trinitarian
[41:42] Doctrine listen do you know what we'll
[41:44] talk about next Sunday do you know that
[41:46] thought that they had
[41:48] that thought that they had at nicaea was
[41:50] the thought of the devil but the
[41:52] religious World accepted it
[41:58] so the thought of God had to come back
[42:00] in the end time
[42:02] through a little man yeah
[42:04] and that pure God of God
[42:07] he would speak and he'd say hey I saw
[42:09] you yesterday you were outside you had
[42:11] on a red shirt you live at 4 26. where'd
[42:14] that come from I didn't come from
[42:16] William Branham but remember that wasn't
[42:18] his message that was to get the
[42:20] attention of the people
[42:22] bait on the hook he said not in the
[42:24] years of preparation not in the healing
[42:27] campaign but when the word what the son
[42:29] of man when he stood one day and he said
[42:32] I had my father are one
[42:35] Amen brother Brown said he said when the
[42:38] bride says I am my father are one and
[42:40] these other things
[42:42] she'll be an invincible Army
[42:44] I'll tell you some of the visitors here
[42:46] I know you all know it but I think as
[42:49] the Bride of Jesus Christ we beat the
[42:51] Oneness up we beat the trinitarians up
[42:54] but we've been tuned this our whole life
[42:56] Jesus over yondering us over here
[42:59] and y'all even understood I said Yonder
[43:01] and you understood what I said
[43:04] but Jesus over there me over here I'm
[43:07] not worthy I'm this I'm not I'm this I'm
[43:09] not
[43:13] bury Johnson
[43:16] father I pray that they may be one they
[43:21] as we are one now how was the father in
[43:23] Jesus one
[43:25] no
[43:26] one
[43:29] we are the further manifestation of God
[43:33] through Jesus Christ
[43:34] everybody with me we are not Tunas we're
[43:38] Oneness
[43:39] true Oneness
[43:41] Adam and Eve were truly one they were
[43:44] literally bone of the bone and flesh of
[43:46] the flesh they literally had their own
[43:48] DNA now you and me and my wife been
[43:50] married 43 years Mom and Dad have been
[43:51] married 60 something years some of you
[43:53] have been married a long time
[43:55] but you never won
[43:57] you'll have two dnas you'll have two
[43:59] thoughts you'll have two ideas oh come
[44:01] on somebody say Amen okay all right I
[44:04] stopped me and Jim was the only one I'm
[44:06] glad to worry about it here
[44:09] but uh
[44:12] Adam and Eve though were one body but
[44:15] yet two separate beings standing here
[44:18] brother Brown said that's true Oneness
[44:21] true Oneness was God could come down
[44:23] talk to Adam and Eve in the garden treat
[44:25] them co-equal somebody only after the
[44:29] fall wasn't like this but co-equal so
[44:31] what about the Bride of Jesus Christ no
[44:34] heirs and Joint heirs with Christ
[44:35] whatever he gets we get he got a body
[44:38] change we get a body change he was the
[44:40] son of man we're the son of man
[44:42] [Applause]
[44:44] so now we've looked at a higher form of
[44:47] justification a higher form of
[44:49] sanctification not that we just Die
[44:51] daily but that sanctification has
[44:52] totally wiped the thing out
[44:54] brother Brown said the real you didn't
[44:56] do it amen amen and you got to realize
[44:59] that oh but
[45:01] I was just thinking the other day
[45:04] how bad I was
[45:07] God did
[45:12] extremely we go fishing a lot of times
[45:14] and to see a forgetfulness
[45:17] we go dragging all that old stuff back
[45:20] out
[45:21] and God's like can you just leave it
[45:23] alone stop fishing in this Pond all
[45:27] right I can't remember what you did what
[45:29] a mighty God Amen
[45:32] so now what are we doing we're not we're
[45:35] not we're not
[45:36] we're on the Son of God Revelation but
[45:38] we're heading toward the son of man
[45:39] we're the son of man where we're going
[45:41] to watch speak the word and what
[45:44] the Rapture is going to take place but
[45:45] we're going to speak the word first and
[45:47] the resurrection is going to take place
[45:48] listen we in this church believe one
[45:50] thing for sure I'm not looking for the
[45:52] rapture
[45:53] boy get them quiet
[45:56] and for Rapture Rapture is a culmination
[45:59] of the body change uh them coming out of
[46:03] the ground first so let's preach
[46:05] Resurrection then let's preach body
[46:08] change then let's get out of here
[46:10] because Rapture is ecstasy it means what
[46:12] the culmination the height the what
[46:14] something you want you're going up to
[46:17] but we got to get the dad out of the
[46:18] ground first listen you gotta destroy
[46:20] death in this thing first
[46:21] and through the son of man Revelation
[46:23] that's exactly what we're going to do so
[46:25] let's move on if that's all right y'all
[46:27] foreign
[46:32] the other day
[46:33] we were talking about the three Hebrew
[46:34] children brother Brown was telling a
[46:36] wonderful story and I've just got part
[46:38] of it so I'll paraphrase some of it you
[46:39] know y'all all knew what I was talking
[46:40] about what happened with the three
[46:42] Hebrew children we talk about trials and
[46:44] tribulations that we have in our life
[46:45] and we think man this is so
[46:47] insurmountable what was insurmountable
[46:49] was is that they were looking at a
[46:51] furnace that was heated seven times
[46:53] hotter than it was supposed to be so
[46:55] have you ever been to a campfire and put
[46:57] something in like a burn barrel or
[46:58] something that thing starts glow you
[47:00] know not to touch that
[47:02] they heat it so hot the people that were
[47:05] taking them in died
[47:07] but you know what it did to them it
[47:09] didn't kill them what it does brother
[47:11] Brown said it loosed them from what they
[47:13] their bonds it just burnt their bonds
[47:16] off same way with you and I tribulation
[47:18] we go through we say all this is the end
[47:21] my kids are gone my wife's this my
[47:23] husband my family my church
[47:27] maybe if you'll keep walking
[47:30] toward the fire
[47:32] keep walking toward the fire baby you're
[47:35] bounds what you bound with is gonna be
[47:37] loosed you know what they didn't even
[47:40] smell like smoke that's how much God
[47:43] protected them but watch this brother
[47:44] Ryan says sometimes in our own life that
[47:46] Paradox repeats sometimes you're brought
[47:48] to a showdown where you have to make a
[47:51] decision I've been preaching on making a
[47:53] decision because you got to make a
[47:54] decision whether you won't go up to
[47:55] statutory man or not
[47:57] where you have to make a decision you
[47:58] have to stand on that decision like they
[48:01] did they stood up one day and said hey
[48:03] that's all right you worship whoever you
[48:06] want to we're not worshiping that image
[48:08] which was the image of who oh well and
[48:12] then a prophet
[48:18] think about that for a minute
[48:20] they said but we're not bowing down to
[48:21] that image
[48:23] if we die we die if we live we live
[48:25] we're going ahead we're heading toward
[48:26] the furnace
[48:27] oh no I don't want that for you got to
[48:30] go through fiery trials to burn off the
[48:33] bands that you got wrapped around your
[48:35] head or your arms or your feet
[48:38] and listen even when Lazarus was raised
[48:40] from the dead he was still bound
[48:43] remember Jesus said loosen and let him
[48:46] go
[48:47] we need to lose it we've had a
[48:50] resurrection in our soul we've had a
[48:53] resurrection but what about our
[48:55] loosening to let us go so that we can go
[48:57] up the statue of perfect man and we
[48:58] could be a living moving instrumentality
[49:00] of God everybody with me
[49:02] you have to stand on that decision and
[49:05] I'm going to tell you something folks
[49:06] God is going to make you make a decision
[49:08] you've heard me say it many times before
[49:10] he's not going to let you be wishy washy
[49:12] all the time he'll put up with you every
[49:14] once in a while but somewhere or someday
[49:16] you're gonna have to stand and say I'll
[49:17] take it or I won't take it right
[49:21] I have decided to follow Jesus
[49:25] like they did and it all worked together
[49:27] for the good what did he do it never
[49:29] hurt him it loosed them
[49:31] and I like what brother Brown said in
[49:33] that rest of that quote he's talking
[49:35] about the man that was drowning in the
[49:36] water he said you got to get the man out
[49:39] of the water first before he can get the
[49:40] water out of the man
[49:41] amen hey man you gotta get the man out
[49:45] of the water preach repeat repentance
[49:48] get them out of the water
[49:49] and then get the water out of the man
[49:52] in other words get them out of the world
[49:54] and then get the world out of them
[49:56] amen by what preaching the word of God
[49:59] not stomping shouting Thorn them
[50:00] throwing them across the aisles no
[50:03] the word of God defeats more demons than
[50:06] anything in the world
[50:08] Jesus Christ look these son of man if
[50:10] we're going to be that character
[50:12] I believe in prayer lines I believe in
[50:14] laying on hands you know what but Jesus
[50:16] never had to do that he didn't have to
[50:17] he did he did because of them
[50:20] he wanted to do it the Gentile way oh
[50:22] you just say the word and it'll happen
[50:26] got called a dog one of those Gentile
[50:28] women did and she said but dogs eat from
[50:31] the master's table
[50:33] so us Gentile dogs have assembled today
[50:35] to eat for the crumbs from the master's
[50:37] table amen
[50:38] amen but we have been transformed by the
[50:41] renewing of our mind what into the Bride
[50:44] of Jesus Christ that what we sit at the
[50:46] table all the time now
[50:48] amen
[50:50] but we got to get to a place
[50:52] brother Brown said look committed to him
[50:54] the greatest weapon I know of a
[50:56] Christian today is what committal to God
[51:00] Camille to God give me time that's right
[51:03] when you can't do nothing about it just
[51:05] commit it to him and what God will take
[51:08] care of it
[51:10] amen
[51:11] greatest battle ever fought
[51:13] I believe it's the greatest battle it's
[51:15] ever fought is look 1962.
[51:19] he said it's now ready
[51:21] to go into action
[51:23] you think man that's going to action
[51:25] since 1947 back in spursion and all no
[51:28] he said right here it took a prophet to
[51:29] tell us now the battle is fixing the
[51:31] rage
[51:33] and it's going to rage Satan against the
[51:35] bride
[51:37] listen the devil the devil care about
[51:38] them people out there
[51:44] he's not got the bride defeated
[51:46] and even in the bride you know somebody
[51:48] said many times ago many years ago they
[51:50] said oh the bride really looks bad or
[51:53] looks awful it looks bad for the never
[51:55] has
[51:56] right you're looking at the mixed
[51:58] multitude
[51:59] you're looking at the ones that's
[52:01] hanging around for the fishes in the
[52:02] loaves you're not looking at the true
[52:04] bride because the true bride will always
[52:06] always stand forward always be the best
[52:09] and always take what God Said Amen
[52:12] always
[52:14] and I believe it's the greatest Bible
[52:15] Ever Fall is now ready to go into action
[52:18] now so that's the prophet he told us now
[52:20] it's ready to go into action what when
[52:22] the seals open that opened up the mind
[52:24] of God
[52:26] but remember it also open up the mind of
[52:28] the devil too
[52:29] because he's got to Incarnate a beast
[52:31] down here at the end time and he don't
[52:34] know how to do that until God incarnates
[52:36] me and you because remember he's a
[52:37] copycat he's not an originator he don't
[52:39] know how that's why he's watching you
[52:41] that's why he came to church he got here
[52:42] for you dude
[52:44] some of you brought him with you
[52:46] I believe that God has been selecting
[52:48] his soldiers that's us I believe he's
[52:51] been dressing them
[52:54] training them for 60 years since the
[52:57] prophet left training them in the
[52:59] Battlefront is now set getting ready to
[53:02] start where in the mind
[53:05] of the individual
[53:07] when this great battle started on Earth
[53:09] there had to be a mutual meeting place
[53:10] there had to be a place selected for the
[53:12] battle to begin and for the battle to
[53:14] raise now look that battle began where
[53:16] in the human mind we know that because
[53:18] that's why he preached the greatest
[53:18] battle ever fought everybody with me all
[53:21] right and that Battleground began in the
[53:22] human mind it didn't begin in the heart
[53:27] because you were dead and lost
[53:30] if Satan was in your soul
[53:34] amen
[53:36] so that's not that's the choice you got
[53:38] to make to drive that unclean Spirit
[53:40] down and let God come in Seal you in as
[53:42] a unit everybody with me okay
[53:45] chief
[53:48] he said now in me after he gets born
[53:50] again listen I didn't have a fight when
[53:52] I wasn't born again
[53:55] did you
[53:58] know am I talking to the same people
[54:02] I didn't fight I did what I wanted to do
[54:05] said what I wanted to say drink what I
[54:08] wanted to drink go where I wanted to go
[54:10] why it's all black
[54:13] but oh when the Holy Ghost comes here
[54:16] burns out that black Satan knows he
[54:18] can't get it's like that hot furnace say
[54:21] you're trying to grab your shoulder he's
[54:22] like
[54:24] oh but you got a spirit realm I can get
[54:27] into that Spirit realm and I can play
[54:29] that's my playground
[54:30] that's why God took the heart now
[54:32] Satan's not in your what your heart your
[54:34] soul then the Battleground begins in
[54:36] what in your mind
[54:37] there is where the battle starts the
[54:39] human mind was chosen for the place of
[54:42] battle where it was beginning that is
[54:44] because the decisions
[54:48] are made from the mind
[54:51] the head
[54:53] brother Brown tells us in the church age
[54:55] book
[54:56] you have to suffer the rain
[54:58] remember
[55:02] sister Larissa this is not a cruise ship
[55:05] we're not on a cruise ship voyage
[55:08] Fantasy Island
[55:10] bring me a no I don't drink my ties what
[55:12] I was going to say that for bring me
[55:14] bring me something
[55:16] don't be laughing
[55:18] but this is a battleship your own
[55:21] it's a big difference
[55:23] on the cruise ship the cruise ship
[55:26] is fine on about
[55:29] are you going to kill somebody we're
[55:30] going to kill the devil I want him daddy
[55:33] you know what God's given us the
[55:34] ammunition he's given us an Army full of
[55:38] Believers that needs to put on that
[55:40] armor
[55:42] but you got to suffer a little bit
[55:44] remember five-star generals were not
[55:47] made in the mess hall
[55:49] five-star generals was made in the
[55:51] battlefield he made the right decision
[55:53] based on what based on his intelligence
[55:56] he made the right decision and then what
[55:59] he saved many lives he won the battle so
[56:01] therefore he gets five-star
[56:04] or whatever how many on his shoulder so
[56:06] it goes to what
[56:08] suffering to rain the reason for this is
[56:10] that character is never made without
[56:12] suffering characters of Victory not
[56:15] something you were born with even at the
[56:17] new birth
[56:19] well don't get quiet on me now
[56:22] it was a victory to get born again but
[56:24] now you got other battles to start with
[56:25] all right A Man Without character can't
[56:28] Reign because power what the Holy Ghost
[56:31] without character is satanic
[56:34] um but Power with character is fit to
[56:38] rule all right say bye with me brother
[56:41] Robert said why am I against organized
[56:42] relation religion now many times we've
[56:45] heard people preach on the Statue of
[56:47] perfect well actually we won't hear many
[56:48] people ever preach on the Statue of
[56:49] perfect man but a lot of them preach it
[56:51] with the pyramid turned upside down
[56:52] you've got to get all these virtues
[56:54] before you get to Holy Ghost yes there
[56:56] is a doctors that I've heard it before
[56:57] brother Dale has two and Aaron has two
[57:01] that you got to get all these virtues to
[57:03] get the Holy Ghost how you gonna get
[57:04] Holy Ghost virtue without the Holy Ghost
[57:06] amen amen
[57:08] that's the devil putting a thought in
[57:11] your mind
[57:14] but that Holy Spirit seals you in
[57:16] remember if you've got a little crack
[57:18] the devil's gonna stick his finger in it
[57:21] a little bit of crack in the building
[57:23] have you ever seen a building though you
[57:24] go see the building you see a little
[57:25] crack if there's nothing done about it
[57:27] what's going to happen in about five
[57:28] years
[57:29] crack's gonna be about this alone
[57:31] by five more years after that in other
[57:33] words you and your battle in your
[57:34] journey your armor is going to have a
[57:36] crack in it Satan's gonna stick his
[57:38] finger in it
[57:40] but remember folks look
[57:43] if what is purpose to the church that's
[57:45] me and you the life that was in Christ
[57:47] isn't reflecting in you don't you stand
[57:49] still
[57:51] until you haven't got until you've got
[57:53] haven't got patience virtue and all
[57:55] these things Temperance godliness and
[57:57] all these things are required
[57:59] it's a requirement amen that we preach
[58:02] on this it's a requirement that you come
[58:04] to these virtues
[58:06] then of course I I I'm not going to
[58:09] background much on this but you've heard
[58:11] the expression it's all in your head
[58:14] amen God's all in your head because
[58:17] remember when you see that it means it
[58:19] comes from your head it's imaginary made
[58:20] up psychosomatic
[58:22] while it indeed is from your head it
[58:24] implies that it was created by your mind
[58:27] not that it's from your brain
[58:32] we come on the internet must be right
[58:39] it means if something is all in your
[58:40] head you have imagined it and it's not
[58:43] real
[58:45] how many times have we had a thought
[58:49] that we formulated
[58:51] we've created we've colored it
[58:56] and it never come to pass
[58:59] God is not that way
[59:01] when he has
[59:08] such a man got involved in not seeing
[59:10] all the different ones and it was all in
[59:12] their head yeah yeah they formulated an
[59:14] idea that God was three they formulated
[59:16] that the father son Holy Ghost was a
[59:18] Doctrine and that there was a purgatory
[59:20] and that there was this and that and the
[59:22] other that was a formulation but you
[59:24] know what man didn't think of it all
[59:26] herself
[59:27] Satan had a what he had partied because
[59:29] why he can get in your mind
[59:31] he can run around in your mind
[59:33] and he can make you think these things
[59:35] that's what he did with Martin Luther
[59:36] Martin Luther was born again believer in
[59:38] his soul
[59:39] but what a paradox that it was in his
[59:43] soul never believed what he was
[59:44] preaching
[59:48] somebody say Amen
[59:50] because that couldn't there's no way a
[59:52] father said holy ghost doctor and
[59:54] originated from his soul if he was born
[59:55] again that's right it originated of a
[59:58] formulation of a spirit that he got on
[1:00:00] him come on somebody that's where all
[1:00:02] doctrines come from it's a spirit that
[1:00:04] gets on you good or bad
[1:00:08] so is it all in your head
[1:00:14] James 1 says be careful
[1:00:16] but let him ask in faith nothing
[1:00:18] wavering for he that wavereth is like a
[1:00:20] wave of the seed driven with the wind
[1:00:22] and tossed for let not that man think
[1:00:24] that he shall receive anything of the
[1:00:26] Lord a double-minded man
[1:00:30] I'm reading the Bible
[1:00:32] it's unstable in some of his ways
[1:00:36] oh it says all y'all can read that
[1:00:38] it says all his ways oh
[1:00:43] that word double-minded actually means
[1:00:45] wavering uncertain doubting look divided
[1:00:48] in interest
[1:00:50] some of you say here today with thoughts
[1:00:52] in your mind and you're in you're
[1:00:53] somewhere else
[1:00:54] [Music]
[1:00:57] I'll have my hand up there's something
[1:00:59] Sometimes some people been preaching my
[1:01:02] mind went somewhere else
[1:01:04] Elvis had left the building
[1:01:16] but don't we though
[1:01:18] you formulate ideas
[1:01:21] especially either the excuse you make of
[1:01:22] well I'm not listening to him because I
[1:01:24] don't understand him I don't like him
[1:01:25] he's not wearing my favorite vest he's
[1:01:35] but if you bring those thoughts the
[1:01:36] Bible says in captivity
[1:01:39] to the word of God
[1:01:41] bring those thoughts that's what we're
[1:01:42] going to talk about next Sunday bring
[1:01:44] those thoughts listen cast down
[1:01:46] imagination listen uh brother Dale tells
[1:01:49] a story about this one brother was real
[1:01:51] honest with him back when he was
[1:01:52] preaching uh brother comes out up to
[1:01:54] brother Dale after the service and
[1:01:56] brother Dale said I want to tell you I
[1:01:58] what oh he said I'll he said I figured
[1:02:00] out how to fix my tractor while you were
[1:02:02] preaching right
[1:02:04] foreign
[1:02:06] Place y'all don't do that to me that
[1:02:08] hurt my feelings
[1:02:11] I want to think that everybody's getting
[1:02:13] it all getting everything
[1:02:14] [Music]
[1:02:18] at least he was honest
[1:02:20] he learned how to fix this
[1:02:23] but that was him that was his thoughts
[1:02:25] [Music]
[1:02:27] cast down imagination we're going to
[1:02:29] talk about that maybe next
[1:02:34] remember you you can't you can't help
[1:02:36] the birds that fly over your barn
[1:02:39] but take a double barrel shotgun and
[1:02:41] blow them in the head and they won't
[1:02:42] build a nest in your house I promise you
[1:02:44] that
[1:02:52] you can use a single barrel if you want
[1:02:54] to but the double barrel Works twice as
[1:02:55] good
[1:02:58] but brother Ram tells us even the right
[1:02:59] mental attitude
[1:03:01] the right mental attitude toward any
[1:03:04] promise of God now not the right mental
[1:03:05] attitude toward what you want
[1:03:10] no the right mental attitude toward any
[1:03:14] Divine promise you're right mental
[1:03:15] attitude toward God's Divine promise
[1:03:17] will bring any promise to pass now maybe
[1:03:20] you don't believe that you say well my
[1:03:22] faith is weak I wouldn't confess it
[1:03:25] see don't let the devil know it
[1:03:28] I always say I've got good faith I
[1:03:32] believe God with all my heart see don't
[1:03:34] testify nothing
[1:03:37] all the devil made me do it now I'm like
[1:03:39] brother Dale there's a lot of things you
[1:03:41] blame on the devil you did yourself
[1:03:43] he just might have encouraged you to do
[1:03:46] it and when you stepped out into his
[1:03:48] field guess
[1:03:54] always remember Church God's words are
[1:03:56] true I believe the right mental attitude
[1:03:59] toward any Divine promise of God would
[1:04:00] bring it to pass if you can look at look
[1:04:03] if you can look at it in the right way
[1:04:06] but remember here's my standard in life
[1:04:08] and I read this because this should be
[1:04:09] our standard in life because what
[1:04:10] brother John was preaching this morning
[1:04:12] the first thing I want to find out
[1:04:15] whether it's the will of God or not
[1:04:17] and what is his will as well as his word
[1:04:19] yeah it's like I told you about your
[1:04:21] brother the brother comes up to the
[1:04:23] pastor of a church several years ago and
[1:04:25] says says brother God has impressed me
[1:04:27] now bro Steve don't you try this God has
[1:04:30] impressed me to go to work on Sunday
[1:04:33] well he was right there out of the will
[1:04:34] of God to go to work Sunday to make this
[1:04:37] extra like double time that is this
[1:04:40] place he volunteered for it
[1:04:43] so I can give all the money to missions
[1:04:46] well this motive and objective was right
[1:04:48] sure
[1:04:50] sure but the will of God it was not so
[1:04:52] that stopped the whole plan right there
[1:04:54] if it's not the will of God
[1:04:56] whether whether you're motive and
[1:04:57] objective listen they are some hungry
[1:04:59] people overseas that he didn't feed I'm
[1:05:01] sure but about a year from that
[1:05:04] he didn't start he wasn't even going to
[1:05:06] church
[1:05:07] he backslid
[1:05:08] see he got out of the will of God first
[1:05:10] first name brother Brown said look find
[1:05:13] out whether it's the will of God or not
[1:05:14] then I know it's God's will the next
[1:05:17] things he moved on I know it's God's
[1:05:19] will
[1:05:19] the next thing he moves to watch see if
[1:05:22] my objective to it and my motive in
[1:05:24] doing it then if it's the will of God my
[1:05:28] objective is right my motive is right
[1:05:30] see if that brother would have said well
[1:05:32] I've got an opportunity to work double
[1:05:33] time on Saturday
[1:05:36] and I'll take that double time money and
[1:05:38] I'll pay it to Mission work that would
[1:05:41] have been fine God would have honored
[1:05:43] that all the way through
[1:05:46] but he went the first one he dropped out
[1:05:49] on the very first one all right because
[1:05:51] first is the will of God no I'm sorry
[1:05:53] let me back up native fish the will of
[1:05:55] God my objective is right my motive is
[1:05:57] right I have faith that it'll be done
[1:06:00] because first is the will of God and I
[1:06:03] have my motive is to glorify him and my
[1:06:06] motive is to my objective is to glorify
[1:06:08] him and my motive is to give him all the
[1:06:10] glory so there's no selfish motives
[1:06:13] about it if you have a selfish motive it
[1:06:16] won't work listen we're the most selfish
[1:06:18] people in the world we got selfies we
[1:06:19] got selfie sticks we take selfie
[1:06:21] pictures we have Instagram we have
[1:06:22] Twitter we got all these different
[1:06:24] things that you take a picture of
[1:06:25] yourself
[1:06:26] thank you
[1:06:26] yep
[1:06:31] first time I was ever exposed to that
[1:06:32] was several years ago when I went to
[1:06:34] Philippines all them folks has got them
[1:06:36] they're the little short things anyway
[1:06:37] and they got one of them things that
[1:06:39] just stands out
[1:06:40] I thought what it was like a fishing
[1:06:42] pole
[1:06:44] but on the end don't laugh
[1:06:47] at the end of it with the phone and
[1:06:50] they're holding that thing way out like
[1:06:52] this they're all going
[1:06:54] I said that's what that's for yeah yeah
[1:06:58] that's what it's for
[1:07:00] selfish motive
[1:07:02] if you have a selfish motive it will not
[1:07:04] work
[1:07:05] if your objective is to make money for
[1:07:07] yourself or something you'll never
[1:07:08] succeed
[1:07:10] brother John was talking about this
[1:07:11] morning and then try to do something
[1:07:13] outside of the will of the lord it's not
[1:07:15] the word to begin with
[1:07:17] okay
[1:07:20] listen to this
[1:07:21] is brother Brown look I go on record in
[1:07:24] other words this is thus saith the Lord
[1:07:26] I go on record I say this about the word
[1:07:28] of God being a seed if you can take the
[1:07:30] right mental attitude toward any Divine
[1:07:33] promise of God why are you harping on
[1:07:35] this brother wait because look our
[1:07:37] attitude our mental human attitude is to
[1:07:40] not do any of that
[1:07:42] mm-hmm
[1:07:46] the mind the rock crown
[1:07:48] okay just want to make sure if y'all
[1:07:50] switched over another one came in
[1:07:52] look
[1:07:54] you want human knowledge you want to
[1:07:57] have a temper
[1:07:59] hello Regina you know you wanted to have
[1:08:02] one it pleased you to have a temper when
[1:08:05] you were not in a willow when you were
[1:08:06] not born again
[1:08:08] I told you I could I didn't have to hit
[1:08:10] you with my my hand I hit you with this
[1:08:13] yeah
[1:08:15] I cuss you every name in the book make
[1:08:17] you feel about that tall
[1:08:19] well God didn't remold my mouth
[1:08:22] he put a new nature in now hopefully
[1:08:26] that same mouth is trying to get you to
[1:08:27] do the same thing to yours
[1:08:33] so he's not going to take the vessel and
[1:08:35] destroy it
[1:08:36] he's going to repurpose it
[1:08:39] amen
[1:08:40] he didn't cut your arm off if you draped
[1:08:42] beer he didn't cut your arm off and put
[1:08:44] you in your hand on there because this
[1:08:45] one had Michelob in it or whatever it
[1:08:46] was no what he transforms you by the
[1:08:49] renewing of your mind that you don't
[1:08:50] want stuff anymore but it didn't bother
[1:08:53] you to have a temper you sure didn't
[1:08:55] want to have patience and some of us
[1:08:56] have that problem already all right
[1:08:58] everybody with me
[1:09:00] and brother kindness out the door
[1:09:05] our Bible said hate your neighbor as you
[1:09:07] hate everybody else
[1:09:10] and I ain't talking about your physical
[1:09:11] neighbor in your house I'm talking about
[1:09:13] everybody
[1:09:15] we had hatred listen all those things
[1:09:17] the Bible tells us what we had in our
[1:09:19] nature
[1:09:20] defiled things we they were just nasty
[1:09:23] yeah
[1:09:24] oh I know I wasn't no your Halo may have
[1:09:27] been held up by horns
[1:09:29] but
[1:09:32] if you can get yourself in position to
[1:09:34] believe that that promise was to you
[1:09:39] if you can what get in position
[1:09:41] to believe that that promise was made to
[1:09:45] you what was the promise the promise is
[1:09:47] we're going to win this battle
[1:09:49] he's going to equip us how's he going to
[1:09:51] equip us
[1:09:52] I left that out but I've been reading it
[1:09:53] so many times you ought to know it he
[1:09:55] gave us Apostles prophets pastors
[1:09:57] teachers and evangelists
[1:10:00] and you can press play if you want to
[1:10:02] that's fine
[1:10:03] but you're not going to get you're not
[1:10:05] gonna grow that statue of perfect man
[1:10:06] just by pressing play I promise you that
[1:10:08] you're gonna have to listen to it live
[1:10:10] man
[1:10:12] I know brother Jason believes in that
[1:10:13] it's live Ministry somebody look you in
[1:10:16] the face and say we all go on to health
[1:10:18] we don't do the right thing
[1:10:25] hey either Faith or doubt yeah right
[1:10:29] ain't no halfway
[1:10:31] we got to get down to the battle here
[1:10:33] which side are you on
[1:10:35] you know what they call somebody that's
[1:10:37] kind of wishy-washy they call them a
[1:10:38] traitor
[1:10:39] and you know what usually he ends up
[1:10:42] dead
[1:10:43] usually he ends up dead and a lot of
[1:10:45] times the people he was doing the
[1:10:47] training with get him
[1:10:49] because they think he might be doing
[1:10:51] this over here well guess what I promise
[1:10:53] you the devil is a traitor
[1:10:55] he may try to get you to do stuff under
[1:10:58] the auspice that it was God
[1:11:01] yeah yeah you're right because remember
[1:11:03] brother Brown said you can have the
[1:11:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost on your spirit
[1:11:09] every day of your life
[1:11:11] Miracles preaching
[1:11:16] and dying go to hell
[1:11:19] that's how close it is
[1:11:21] so I was telling you the other day
[1:11:22] somebody came up to me and we were
[1:11:23] talking about something they said man
[1:11:24] when I read anointed ones at the end
[1:11:26] time he said that sermon scared me to
[1:11:28] death
[1:11:29] it should yeah
[1:11:31] they should
[1:11:33] it's so close that it would deceive us
[1:11:36] if God didn't put that little thing
[1:11:38] inside of us that we went to church and
[1:11:40] we listened to a five-fold Ministry and
[1:11:42] that fivefold Ministry taught you the
[1:11:44] word of God to drive that unclean Spirit
[1:11:46] out of you like I said before Jesus
[1:11:48] never screamed at one demon
[1:11:50] not one
[1:11:52] actually they screamed to him
[1:11:57] listen the Devils called him God
[1:12:00] and the religious world called him a
[1:12:02] devil
[1:12:03] right all your bills above and then
[1:12:05] those demons when he walked up to those
[1:12:07] demons those demons say what are you
[1:12:08] doing here they were looking in the
[1:12:10] spirit Realm they saw this
[1:12:15] all the fallen angels that it fell from
[1:12:16] glory and they said we recognize you
[1:12:19] what are you doing here
[1:12:21] you're the son of God
[1:12:23] Jesus said hold your peace
[1:12:27] just leave can we just let's get out of
[1:12:29] the building folks I wish every devil in
[1:12:32] hell would do that now please leave this
[1:12:34] building
[1:12:37] we want God to be comfortable but we
[1:12:39] want the devil to be so uncomfortable
[1:12:41] until he leaves the building we want to
[1:12:43] be so uncomfortable in you until he
[1:12:45] leaves you
[1:12:48] according to his Divine as his divine
[1:12:51] power hath given unto us all things
[1:12:54] I can't believe people don't believe
[1:12:55] again I get born again there's nothing
[1:12:56] Divine but God
[1:12:58] there's no divine power in the devil
[1:13:00] that you weren't born with a divine
[1:13:02] power
[1:13:03] you were born with hatred malice gods
[1:13:06] and all those things the Bible said but
[1:13:08] according as his divine power hath given
[1:13:10] unto us us some things
[1:13:14] oh you want me to make it a little bit
[1:13:16] bigger it says oh
[1:13:18] things that pertain unto life and
[1:13:20] godliness
[1:13:21] to the knowledge of him that's called us
[1:13:23] the glory of virtue
[1:13:25] whereby are giving unto us exceeding
[1:13:27] great and precious promises that by
[1:13:29] these you might be partakers of the
[1:13:31] divine nature
[1:13:33] from the get-go
[1:13:35] because he's going to say it besides
[1:13:37] this but that's what besides getting
[1:13:39] bored again
[1:13:41] add these things to you yes giving all
[1:13:43] diligence what is diligence haste
[1:13:45] earnestness uh well
[1:13:47] I I think I'll try
[1:13:50] I think I'll try to do it I don't know
[1:13:53] that furnace looks really hot
[1:13:55] you know what you're bound
[1:13:58] number one your mind is bound
[1:14:01] you're professing and confessing
[1:14:03] something that you shouldn't listen
[1:14:04] that's the imagination of your mind to
[1:14:06] say that God can't do to you what he
[1:14:08] done to others
[1:14:12] that's binding you
[1:14:14] you're binding you who's your worst
[1:14:16] enemy the devil mouth you're your worst
[1:14:18] enemy
[1:14:19] right absolutely
[1:14:21] hey
[1:14:23] so besides this
[1:14:25] giving all Earnest giving all giving all
[1:14:28] diligence add
[1:14:30] why we need that we already got it
[1:14:34] I think that word add means to add to
[1:14:38] add to your faith now it's your faith
[1:14:41] it's not God's faith anymore it's your
[1:14:43] faith because you've what you've molded
[1:14:45] or melded with the faith of God
[1:14:48] vulcanize the prophet said and now add
[1:14:51] to that Faith virtue
[1:14:54] our Chasse virtue face
[1:14:57] because you don't lose Faith all the way
[1:14:59] up that pyramid
[1:15:00] you got to have faith that you'll have
[1:15:02] the faith of God the virtue of God the
[1:15:05] knowledge of God the temples of God and
[1:15:07] I believe when I look this up it really
[1:15:09] impressed me because you looked that
[1:15:11] word ad you say oh it's just plus and
[1:15:13] read what the Greek meaning of that is
[1:15:17] to minister until
[1:15:20] there's no way
[1:15:22] you might be able again like I said to
[1:15:24] press play and get born again
[1:15:27] but you'll never press play and continue
[1:15:29] that way and add these virtues to your
[1:15:32] life
[1:15:33] you can't do it you got to have a live
[1:15:35] Ministry to deal with life problems with
[1:15:37] live issues and the things that go on in
[1:15:39] our life from Sunday to Wednesday till
[1:15:41] Sunday to Wednesday till Sunday to
[1:15:42] Wednesday till we get out of here
[1:15:45] so ad means to minister nourishment
[1:15:49] Minister unto so you got to have a
[1:15:52] minister
[1:15:54] amen
[1:15:56] all right listen to this a person of
[1:16:00] virtue makes the progression from
[1:16:01] knowing what is right to doing what is
[1:16:03] right you get born again you're a babe
[1:16:05] in Christ all right you're going to fall
[1:16:07] you're going to cry babies cry
[1:16:09] right babies cry all right we cry out by
[1:16:13] father tells us in the Book of Romans
[1:16:14] that's because we were newborn babes
[1:16:16] right Desiring the sincere milk of the
[1:16:18] word but what Paul tell us what grow up
[1:16:21] there's meat
[1:16:23] I had a glass of milk this morning with
[1:16:25] my egg it was good
[1:16:27] but I don't want glass of milk for lunch
[1:16:29] and a glass of milk for supper we do
[1:16:32] believe in supper around here dinner's
[1:16:34] in the middle of the day suppers at
[1:16:35] night I just want to make sure that's
[1:16:37] clear on that because it was the Lord's
[1:16:38] Supper not the Lord's dinner
[1:16:40] that was in the evening the Bible tells
[1:16:42] us all right
[1:16:43] but you learn everything when you come
[1:16:45] here
[1:16:46] something you shouldn't some you
[1:16:47] shouldn't
[1:16:49] but look it's going from knowing what's
[1:16:51] right to doing what's right so now we
[1:16:53] gotta do this yes
[1:16:55] we gotta do this we know what's right
[1:16:57] now we got to do it look he or she
[1:17:00] intentionally chooses what to say do in
[1:17:03] value reaching beyond the good toward
[1:17:06] the best look this is not self-help yeah
[1:17:09] this is the Bible all right you can read
[1:17:12] self-help books that's okay
[1:17:13] but the Bible is where you're going to
[1:17:15] get your nourishment from The Prophet's
[1:17:16] message is where you're going to get
[1:17:17] your nourishment from
[1:17:19] reach beyond the good toward the best in
[1:17:22] every situation a virtuous person knows
[1:17:25] that they have an opportunity to honor
[1:17:27] the Lord power without character it's
[1:17:29] satanic but Power with characters what
[1:17:31] fit to rule and reflect him to others
[1:17:35] it's not that we hold these virtues and
[1:17:37] we keep them in
[1:17:42] first thing you want to do is let it out
[1:17:44] first thing you want to do is somebody
[1:17:46] come up to you and say it's like I said
[1:17:48] before
[1:17:49] um well Steve I said if you have a
[1:17:52] headache or or a problem or an issue
[1:17:54] with your wife or or anything that goes
[1:17:56] on like that your kids you didn't get
[1:17:58] that did you
[1:18:00] do you go to the convenience store and
[1:18:02] ask that guy to pray for you
[1:18:04] why
[1:18:06] there's no
[1:18:09] facing brother to Mars brother different
[1:18:11] one hey I need some help will you pray
[1:18:13] for me why because there's virtue there
[1:18:15] yes right there's something you can pull
[1:18:17] from right get on the phone and call a
[1:18:20] brother a sister
[1:18:22] you don't call a convenience store
[1:18:23] operator or the guy you know he may be a
[1:18:25] good guy I don't say anything about it
[1:18:27] but still you don't want to pray for it
[1:18:29] because there's no virtue there there's
[1:18:30] no life because he said the beer and
[1:18:32] wine and cigarettes and all the other
[1:18:34] stuff so all right everybody with me all
[1:18:37] right so reflect him to others
[1:18:42] real quick
[1:18:43] I don't have to be real quick we ain't
[1:18:45] got to be there at four o'clock I'm
[1:18:46] preaching till three so
[1:18:48] I told y'all already
[1:18:50] I warned you
[1:18:53] pack your lunch
[1:18:58] listen how many times did Monica tell us
[1:19:00] not to be there early
[1:19:01] I'm just ain't doing what Monica said to
[1:19:03] do okay
[1:19:04] so if we leave here if we preschool
[1:19:06] three we leave at 3 3 15 we'll get that
[1:19:08] four we'll be fine
[1:19:10] I'm just kidding
[1:19:12] kinda
[1:19:14] but these virtues listen it's not just
[1:19:16] at virtues the first first ad
[1:19:19] these are all virtues everybody with me
[1:19:22] all right so that whole word of of that
[1:19:25] is moral Excellence value Merit
[1:19:27] meritiousness like we were just talking
[1:19:29] before specifically moral excellence
[1:19:33] not just be morally good there's a lot
[1:19:35] of people that are morally good sure
[1:19:37] a lot of people there's a lot of people
[1:19:39] outside me and you
[1:19:40] I don't know if you know them but I know
[1:19:42] a few of them
[1:19:44] okay
[1:19:46] but there's something inside though
[1:19:48] that makes us want to go a little bit
[1:19:50] further
[1:19:51] just a little bit further not that
[1:19:54] they're bad
[1:19:56] that's something they don't have maybe
[1:19:58] you got something you give them
[1:20:01] but like Daddy said before he said many
[1:20:03] many times he said maybe your kids don't
[1:20:05] want this message because you don't live
[1:20:06] it in front of them
[1:20:09] blame him don't blame me I'm just
[1:20:12] quoting brother down and that's what he
[1:20:13] said for years he's never backed off on
[1:20:15] it
[1:20:18] mine too I mean everybody all of us what
[1:20:21] look around we go home and talk about
[1:20:23] the preacher
[1:20:27] yeah I'm fixing to get into something
[1:20:28] right now
[1:20:29] you go home and talk about the preacher
[1:20:32] your kids hear that then they start
[1:20:34] making little snippy little comments
[1:20:36] cause you made them first
[1:20:38] or if you can't start talking about it
[1:20:39] or you answer your uncle's anybody you
[1:20:41] don't say hey shut your mouth
[1:20:43] we're working on he's still working on
[1:20:45] me and he's still working on you right
[1:20:46] no we don't do that you know what we do
[1:20:51] here I'm gonna put that log on that fire
[1:20:53] I'm gonna put that bigger log on that
[1:20:55] one I won't see it burn
[1:20:57] no
[1:20:59] no folks
[1:21:02] I need to sweep out her own door first
[1:21:05] I'm talking about all of us
[1:21:07] I got something I got kids that don't
[1:21:09] don't come to church so and I didn't I
[1:21:13] did I tried to live the best I could and
[1:21:15] that's what you got to do you got to try
[1:21:16] to live the best you can around them
[1:21:19] but do they hear you talking about the
[1:21:20] preacher they hear you talking about the
[1:21:21] Deacon they hear you talking about this
[1:21:23] you hear you say well brother Brian
[1:21:24] really didn't mean that he brother well
[1:21:26] we're not going to listen to that tape
[1:21:27] anymore because he hello somebody
[1:21:34] he's still working on me
[1:21:39] real quick
[1:21:41] these virtues affect your senses
[1:21:45] think about it
[1:21:48] the thoughts you have when brother
[1:21:51] Branham
[1:21:52] said virtue
[1:21:55] first thing pops in your mind
[1:21:57] a virgin life
[1:21:59] he said that's not it
[1:22:03] wow what do you mean brother that's not
[1:22:04] no that's not it it's not what he's
[1:22:06] talking about he's done by strength
[1:22:08] right okay uh well you got to have the
[1:22:11] knowledge uh oh we've got knowledge
[1:22:13] we've got DD's llds and Double D's and
[1:22:15] all these other uh college education no
[1:22:19] brother Ryan said that's not what I'm
[1:22:20] talking about
[1:22:22] he said it's knowledge to know whether
[1:22:24] the Bible's right or wrong
[1:22:26] you see what it means so there's a
[1:22:28] paradox there's something going on that
[1:22:30] we all believe this over here as the
[1:22:32] virtues and brother Brown says no that's
[1:22:35] not what that means it means it's over
[1:22:37] here yeah
[1:22:39] yeah
[1:22:41] change a renewing of your mind because
[1:22:43] your mind goes over here
[1:22:46] we got to take our mind and put it back
[1:22:48] over here
[1:22:49] put it in the word of God knowing that
[1:22:51] it is knowledge but it's Heavenly
[1:22:53] knowledge
[1:22:54] all right Heavenly thoughts yes yeah
[1:22:57] sitting in Heavenly places
[1:23:00] I'm trying to understand God I say
[1:23:02] trying because we all try we're trying
[1:23:04] to understand God
[1:23:05] all right so it does affect your senses
[1:23:07] but it starts in that heart or the soul
[1:23:09] of you and that's just faith and doubt
[1:23:12] that's it there's no in between you're
[1:23:13] either a born again believer today or
[1:23:15] you're lost I'm sorry I didn't write the
[1:23:17] book he did right
[1:23:20] and you might be justified and
[1:23:22] Sanctified that's okay but until you
[1:23:24] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:25] you're not born again
[1:23:27] you're not a Christian right you're
[1:23:29] trying absolutely a lot of us are in
[1:23:32] that are in that place but you got to
[1:23:34] come to where you got to put that state
[1:23:35] down and say God you you know me
[1:23:39] you and him the only two that know each
[1:23:41] other real well well the devil does too
[1:23:43] but
[1:23:44] say God I'm done I'm sick and tired of
[1:23:46] being sick and tired this stinking
[1:23:48] thinking has got he's got me over here
[1:23:50] on this side nothing's going right
[1:23:52] that's why I pray when I pray for my
[1:23:54] kids and I pray for your kids I say Lord
[1:23:57] stir their water don't let them sleep
[1:24:01] until they find you just what Josh told
[1:24:05] us one time but we were praying for him
[1:24:07] and and and thank God he's back in
[1:24:09] church and that's great been a while
[1:24:12] but we were he just comes up and he's
[1:24:15] just having a goofy time
[1:24:18] he acts like me now he's not my wife
[1:24:20] it's goofy time he's out of the goofy
[1:24:22] time he's running hitting people he was
[1:24:23] you know speeding and he was getting put
[1:24:25] in jail and poor old mom and dad had to
[1:24:27] go get him one time and that's all he's
[1:24:29] back there now he's
[1:24:32] yes is right
[1:24:34] he comes up to us one day and he says
[1:24:36] would y'all stop praying
[1:24:38] then I was there would y'all stop
[1:24:40] praying to me you said what do you mean
[1:24:43] he said I know y'all praying for me to
[1:24:45] do right he said I'm out here trying to
[1:24:46] do all this and y'all praying for me to
[1:24:48] do right in my whole life being messed
[1:24:49] up

[1:25:21] right there
[1:25:23] be my natural daddy or my spiritual
[1:25:25] Daddy I wonder what that man had because
[1:25:27] I knew there was a fair mom too there

[1:25:30] I wanted that Lifeboat see I didn't call
[1:25:32] it a holy ghost you can call it whatever
[1:25:33] you want to I wanted that life why
[1:25:35] because it was virtue it was something
[1:25:38] that what was in there and it came out
[1:25:41] I didn't look at the mistakes they made
[1:25:45] sorry Mom I
[1:25:50] the hardships of Life yeah hey look at
[1:25:52] that
[1:25:53] I looked at the what will of God
[1:25:56] purpose
[1:25:58] and what they were going to try to do
[1:26:02] right brother Dale wore his he wore his
[1:26:04] body out
[1:26:07] all ministers wear their body out why
[1:26:10] because they're giving so much trying to
[1:26:12] what get your sorry self in I'm one of
[1:26:15] them sorry sales okay I'm sorry yeah why
[1:26:19] I'm sorry South sin right
[1:26:22] yeah
[1:26:23] but where's him at look at brother
[1:26:25] random he was 56 years old when he died
[1:26:26] he looked like he was about 70. yeah
[1:26:29] if you look at it if somebody's got a
[1:26:31] picture of it somewhere you can see his
[1:26:32] hands just a picture of his hands when
[1:26:34] he was doing a wedding
[1:26:36] his hands were all crinkled up looked be
[1:26:39] about 80 years old
[1:26:40] why
[1:26:42] because what he was doing he was doing
[1:26:44] it for me and you why he was letting the
[1:26:47] virtue in knowledge there's no way you
[1:26:50] can't say brother random what a manifest
[1:26:52] the Son of God then all these virtues
[1:26:54] were working through
[1:26:55] well that was just for the profit and he
[1:26:57] left no I don't think so no
[1:26:59] that's for me and you amen
[1:27:04] everybody all right
[1:27:06] we can't go just a little bit further
[1:27:10] not everybody said amen
[1:27:14] at least you're not sleeping
[1:27:17] look
[1:27:19] do not yet understand that whatsoever
[1:27:22] entereth into the mouth and goes out to
[1:27:25] belly is cast out in the drought praise
[1:27:27] God it ain't got nothing to do with the
[1:27:28] diet right brother
[1:27:33] that's right
[1:27:34] but those things right which proceed out
[1:27:38] of the mouth come forth from the heart
[1:27:41] that's what defiles a man
[1:27:44] for out of the heart perceive is what
[1:27:46] evil thoughts murders adulteries
[1:27:48] fornication theft false witness
[1:27:51] blasphemies and I'll quote you where
[1:27:54] um Paul said in Corinthians I said he
[1:27:56] said and such were some of you
[1:27:58] but you're washed but you're sanctified
[1:28:01] I like that word bud every once in a
[1:28:03] while but you're washed
[1:28:05] these are the things which defile them
[1:28:08] that's hands to file is not a man
[1:28:09] remember the
[1:28:11] I said oh he's eating food without
[1:28:13] washing his hands
[1:28:15] well I'm a chief of centers because I
[1:28:18] don't I'm not a good hand washer
[1:28:20] sorry
[1:28:22] I eat with my Fork not my hands
[1:28:28] watch this right here though but watch
[1:28:30] what watch what Paul said in the Book of
[1:28:32] Romans Romans 6 verse 16. know you not
[1:28:35] that to whom you yield yourself servant
[1:28:37] to obey his servants you are to whom you
[1:28:40] obey
[1:28:41] lean this way lean this way all right
[1:28:43] whether of sin unto death or of
[1:28:47] obedience unto righteousness so let's do
[1:28:49] two choices all right by the abundance
[1:28:51] of the heart soul
[1:28:53] but God be thanked that you were the sir
[1:28:55] you were the Servants of sin
[1:28:58] but you have obeyed from the heart
[1:29:02] that form of Doctrine
[1:29:05] which was delivered to you
[1:29:08] according to Ephesians 4.
[1:29:10] prophets pastors teachers evangelists
[1:29:13] being then made free from sin you became
[1:29:16] the Servants of righteousness
[1:29:20] Paul a prisoner of Christ can you say
[1:29:22] you're a prisoner of Christ no I've got
[1:29:24] this I'm in this prison house and I mean
[1:29:26] be a prisoner of Christ one time
[1:29:28] I speak after the manner of man because
[1:29:30] of the affirmity of your flesh for as ye
[1:29:32] have yielded your member servants to
[1:29:34] uncleanness and to iniquity and iniquity
[1:29:37] unto iniquity even so now look yield
[1:29:40] your members what brother Brown tell you
[1:29:42] now here's a great prophet
[1:29:44] the greatest Prophet that ever lived
[1:29:46] before besides Jesus Christ
[1:29:48] the greatest Prophet we listen I mean
[1:29:51] edge of our seat
[1:29:54] brother Branham what I do if I'm stingy
[1:29:59] what'd he say no let me tell you in that
[1:30:02] good Kentucky English he said do the
[1:30:03] vice versa
[1:30:04] you know what that means do the opposite
[1:30:07] no now we need to
[1:30:09] pass and he said if you're stingy start
[1:30:12] giving money away
[1:30:13] some of y'all preached Indy all right
[1:30:20] but now look look that's what Paul's
[1:30:22] saying look even so now yield
[1:30:25] your members service to righteousness
[1:30:28] just ill listen we yield to the devil
[1:30:31] enough Amen to God
[1:30:35] and that word heart means cardia all
[1:30:38] right that's where we get the word
[1:30:39] Cardiology from it denotes the center of
[1:30:42] all physical and spiritual life the
[1:30:45] center and Seed of spiritual life the
[1:30:46] soul or mind as it is the Fountain and
[1:30:49] Seed of the thoughts passions desires
[1:30:51] appetites affections purposes Endeavors
[1:30:53] of the understanding The Faculty the
[1:30:55] seat of the intelligence that's why you
[1:30:57] don't you don't think you don't with
[1:30:59] your brain your brain's a processor it
[1:31:02] processes what comes out of here
[1:31:04] everybody with me yeah right as a man
[1:31:06] thinks in his heart not in his mind
[1:31:09] all right the faculty and see the
[1:31:10] intelligence or the will and character
[1:31:12] of the Soul so far as it is affected and
[1:31:15] Stern in a bad way are good or of the
[1:31:19] soul that is as the seed of the
[1:31:20] sensibilities the affections emotions
[1:31:22] desires appetites and passions it's the
[1:31:25] middle and center of you Matthew 12 34
[1:31:27] says for out of the abundance of the
[1:31:30] what heart the mouth speaketh all right
[1:31:33] a good man out of the good Treasure of
[1:31:34] his heart bringing forth good things
[1:31:36] that evil man have evil Treasures bring
[1:31:38] forth
[1:31:39] evil things then brother Brown real
[1:31:42] quick let me let me run through these I
[1:31:43] want to read because I want to read you
[1:31:44] something you know those five senses are
[1:31:46] what memory reasoning conscious
[1:31:48] affection imagination that's five
[1:31:51] out here now look see tastes Phil
[1:31:54] smelling here is to contact the world
[1:31:56] with they can be absolutely fooled
[1:32:03] absolutely so see they spell smelling
[1:32:05] here it's not something you need to
[1:32:07] depend on
[1:32:09] go deeper
[1:32:11] memory you know that's our problem
[1:32:14] you've heard me say it many times before
[1:32:16] our problem is in that second realm
[1:32:18] because what we remember
[1:32:21] what we reason
[1:32:23] our consciousness
[1:32:27] our imagination
[1:32:30] yeah
[1:32:31] what's what's your old saying don't let
[1:32:33] your imagination get the best of you
[1:32:35] happens a lot
[1:32:38] and then the last one is affection we
[1:32:40] know that's not agape love that's paleo
[1:32:42] love that's the love you have down here
[1:32:44] brother Brown said agape love is from
[1:32:46] heaven
[1:32:48] and if you're born again you have agape
[1:32:50] love in your soul so your Soul's in
[1:32:52] heaven I've already told you many times
[1:32:53] before I believe your soul is in another
[1:32:55] dimension now Not Over Yonder is still
[1:32:58] here
[1:32:59] but it's working in another dimension
[1:33:01] because look this ain't so to it this is
[1:33:04] falling this is something your soul
[1:33:06] should never touch if it's born again
[1:33:08] because evil and good can't live
[1:33:10] together
[1:33:11] you can't mold them together
[1:33:14] to our memory reason conscious affection
[1:33:16] and Imagination is what's killing us and
[1:33:19] brother Adam tells us right here God of
[1:33:21] this evil waves 1965. and as I've said
[1:33:24] many times before folks this is going to
[1:33:26] really stun some of you that are that
[1:33:28] are here for the first time
[1:33:30] your body
[1:33:32] flesh does not sin
[1:33:36] think about it
[1:33:38] it's on a v only a vehicle
[1:33:42] because what's motivating inside just
[1:33:43] like I said before you say you prove
[1:33:45] that Jesus told him one day because in
[1:33:48] the Old Testament the Pharisees could
[1:33:50] stand and say I've never touched that
[1:33:52] woman
[1:33:53] I've never committed adultery
[1:33:55] never touched her
[1:33:58] but Jesus went a little bit further
[1:34:01] he said if you just think about it
[1:34:05] so it wasn't the flesh part
[1:34:08] it was the thought part
[1:34:10] so let's don't say what my flesh made me
[1:34:12] do it no your flesh is something to hold
[1:34:14] on
[1:34:16] all right hold your guts together in
[1:34:17] your real heart and all that other stuff
[1:34:20] it's a capsule that holds you together
[1:34:22] but you what out of the heart perceives
[1:34:24] everything all right
[1:34:27] so don't blame the lies My Flesh maybe
[1:34:30] no
[1:34:32] Jesus said the flesh is weak but the
[1:34:34] spirit's willing
[1:34:35] but he's vice versa for the disciples
[1:34:38] because they fell asleep
[1:34:40] so the five inner senses five outer
[1:34:43] senses five inner senses are memory
[1:34:45] reasons conscious facts and Imagination
[1:34:46] I told you one time before I wanna but I
[1:34:48] want to read this again your memory your
[1:34:50] memory is what you remember
[1:34:52] and you can't erase that I I hope to God
[1:34:55] this that you know there's a lot of
[1:34:57] things that we did when we were younger
[1:35:01] that we remember but there's a lot of
[1:35:02] things we did that we don't remember
[1:35:05] I mean you vaguely remember something
[1:35:07] you know that happened well as time goes
[1:35:09] on time what time heals all wounds
[1:35:13] time the bad stuff because remember the
[1:35:15] Bible says the former things will be
[1:35:16] passed away what in your mind
[1:35:19] God's gonna wipe your hard drive
[1:35:21] but he's going to leave the good things
[1:35:24] he's a good god he's going to leave the
[1:35:27] good at the time you had a wonderful
[1:35:28] time in a service the time you got born
[1:35:30] again the time you married your wife
[1:35:31] come on somebody the time you kids came
[1:35:34] to the Altar and gave their heart to God
[1:35:36] the time you came to the altar you're
[1:35:38] going to remember those things but the
[1:35:40] heartaches and tribes and the things
[1:35:41] that we lord Jesus the things we set up
[1:35:43] and and all night long we worry about
[1:35:46] stuff can't do a thing about them
[1:35:49] and when we get over there you ain't
[1:35:51] even gonna remember they happen
[1:35:53] so why worry about them now
[1:35:59] but what we're about to worry warts
[1:36:02] right we worry about everything
[1:36:05] but that's just a human part but with
[1:36:07] what we got to yield our members over
[1:36:08] here
[1:36:09] to where there's positive
[1:36:12] not to the negative all right one more
[1:36:13] thing and then we'll close
[1:36:15] memory reasoning what we reason things
[1:36:17] out
[1:36:18] it's a decision or or we think a logical
[1:36:21] sensible way you know when they were
[1:36:22] when they were at nicaea they didn't
[1:36:24] come in and go
[1:36:26] I think could have get the people
[1:36:29] to believe this this Doctrine no they
[1:36:33] went in believing that was the doctrine
[1:36:36] that Jesus said
[1:36:38] right
[1:36:39] now the devil was inside going
[1:36:43] I'll get him
[1:36:44] I'll get them but the outside man they
[1:36:46] were trying
[1:36:47] they were trying but they what they
[1:36:50] yielded themselves to the devil and not
[1:36:52] to God all right everybody okay with
[1:36:54] that ain't God knew that
[1:36:55] wink at their ignorance but now now
[1:36:57] today okay you can't be ignorant
[1:37:01] book's been open there's nothing hid
[1:37:05] nothing
[1:37:07] so that gives us power
[1:37:09] to take the word of God like it's
[1:37:11] supposed to not take a false Doctrine
[1:37:13] these people kill you over a false
[1:37:15] Doctrine
[1:37:18] when it's actually killing them
[1:37:22] all right memories and conscious we talk
[1:37:24] about conscience that's just the
[1:37:25] conscious part of you that's when you go
[1:37:27] to sleep at night you have them crazy
[1:37:28] silly dreams that you don't know where
[1:37:30] they came from
[1:37:32] yeah okay just wanted to make sure I
[1:37:34] wasn't the only
[1:37:35] okay
[1:37:37] it's just State that's just the humanity
[1:37:39] part that's just a firing mechanism in
[1:37:40] your brain that's putting all these
[1:37:41] things together all right
[1:37:44] imagination is the act or power of
[1:37:47] forming a mental image of something not
[1:37:49] present to the senses or never will be
[1:37:53] that's exactly what it is
[1:37:55] imagination is what you imagine
[1:37:57] something not present to the senses or
[1:38:00] never will be
[1:38:01] never will come to reality we need to
[1:38:04] get rid of that one I don't like that
[1:38:06] one at all
[1:38:07] but let me tell you this right here and
[1:38:09] then we'll close musicians come on
[1:38:11] Aaron
[1:38:13] I'll read you this real quick
[1:38:17] brother Brown said in Christ the mystery
[1:38:19] or Christ revealed in his own word they
[1:38:21] said they don't have this I just pulled
[1:38:22] it up a few minutes ago
[1:38:25] you can't love with your body
[1:38:28] you love with your spirit
[1:38:30] your body only what projects it all
[1:38:33] right everybody with me all right
[1:38:35] because remember the Pharisee is in
[1:38:37] their heart they wanted to do what they
[1:38:39] couldn't do to that girl
[1:38:41] yeah because he's afraid they'll get
[1:38:44] caught or or and they were under the
[1:38:46] Bible in the Old Testament as long as
[1:38:48] you didn't touch them you were fine but
[1:38:50] Jesus said no you sit there and
[1:38:52] formulate these things in your mind that
[1:38:55] you want to do with them you're just as
[1:38:57] guilty all right
[1:39:00] let me read this real quick
[1:39:02] now this is about affection
[1:39:04] but I thought it timely if we have a
[1:39:06] wedding coming up this is a timely read
[1:39:08] right here we'll stop that we'll
[1:39:10] continue with that a little bit later on
[1:39:12] listen to this let's go and stand our
[1:39:13] feet in time-tested memorials
[1:39:17] was talking about men losing their
[1:39:19] affections for their wife
[1:39:21] and don't love them as they did when
[1:39:23] they were sweethearts
[1:39:25] shame on you
[1:39:27] wait a minute everybody believed brother
[1:39:28] Brown was a prophet everybody hold their
[1:39:30] hand up you don't you didn't believe it

[1:39:37] sweetheart
[1:39:39] absolutely that's the part she should be
[1:39:42] and you should treat her like that
[1:39:45] oh never let that little honeymoon cease
[1:39:48] hmm
[1:39:49] yeah
[1:39:52] because it isn't going to in heaven
[1:39:56] don't let that honeymoon cease because
[1:39:59] it isn't going to in heaven
[1:40:01] praise God
[1:40:05] it's going to be just perfectly one
[1:40:07] there looks like some women ought to
[1:40:10] said Amen to that don't it he said you
[1:40:12] never hear you always hear me about
[1:40:14] balling out women says sister Hickerson
[1:40:16] why don't you say something
[1:40:20] Mr Hickerson why didn't you say
[1:40:22] something
[1:40:23] or somebody oh thank you sister Cox
[1:40:26] that's very good brother cops that's for
[1:40:28] you
[1:40:31] I'm just reading quote
[1:40:33] and we should never forget to honor each
[1:40:36] other always be sweethearts never let it
[1:40:40] sneeze Kathy boy came to me not long ago
[1:40:42] his wife was separated he said Billy I
[1:40:45] hate to come to you I'm Catholic and
[1:40:46] you're a Protestant said but a priest
[1:40:49] run me out of my house or I'm out of his
[1:40:51] house a minute ago
[1:40:53] and I said what's the matter with him he
[1:40:56] said well he told me he says I drink a
[1:40:58] little
[1:40:59] all right he said of a night I worked
[1:41:02] hard and said my wife thinks I ought to
[1:41:03] come in every night and kiss her and hug
[1:41:05] her and make it out I'm telling you what
[1:41:07] brother Brown said and make out just
[1:41:09] like we were fixing to get married
[1:41:13] [Music]
[1:41:17] see you must always remember I said
[1:41:19] she's 40 years old now at that time and
[1:41:23] she really needs your attention
[1:41:28] hmm so they had a divorce court and I'm
[1:41:31] not doing this is kind of funny I don't
[1:41:33] know what to do I said go call her if I
[1:41:36] go out there as a Protestant she won't
[1:41:37] listen to me he said oh she likes you
[1:41:41] and I said you go call her and tell her
[1:41:44] that you've changed your mind
[1:41:48] and so the next day I called the judge
[1:41:50] and talked to him so brother Brown went
[1:41:52] and talked to the judge for him and I
[1:41:54] told the boy I said I'll be sitting
[1:41:56] right down beneath the floor where the
[1:41:58] judge is going to give you a raking over
[1:42:00] I'll be praying for you
[1:42:03] don't tell her about it
[1:42:04] all right he said
[1:42:06] so I was down there praying after a
[1:42:08] while I heard some little clicking
[1:42:10] coming down the steps and here they come
[1:42:11] arms around one another just smiling I
[1:42:15] said well hello there
[1:42:17] he said brother Branham it's been some
[1:42:18] time since I seen you in parentheses he
[1:42:21] said yeah just about 30 minutes ago
[1:42:28] sometimes since I see you and she said
[1:42:30] well Reverend Branham I haven't seen you
[1:42:32] in a long time glad to see you again
[1:42:35] I said thank you why you look like your
[1:42:38] sweethearts I said we're just doing fine
[1:42:41] aren't we honey
[1:42:42] she said yes we are there
[1:42:45] she said
[1:42:46] I have to say it sometime Reverend I
[1:42:48] said thank you very much
[1:42:50] say goodbye to him went by the old boy
[1:42:53] turned around and waved back like this
[1:42:56] they were all happy now listen that's
[1:42:58] right look love conquers everything
[1:43:03] even feel your love
[1:43:05] even feel your love conquers everything
[1:43:07] agape love conquers it all
[1:43:10] but look what he's saying
[1:43:13] that's right
[1:43:15] conquers everything
[1:43:17] just love
[1:43:19] you can have all your signs and
[1:43:21] evidences but just give me love
[1:43:25] he said that'll settle it for me
[1:43:29] Just Give Me Love
[1:43:31] that's right wonderful
[1:43:33] right around I hadn't seen you in a long
[1:43:35] time
[1:43:37] he said I saw him 30 minutes ago
[1:43:40] it's kind of funny
[1:43:41] he let him tell a little fib and he
[1:43:44] didn't take him to the Altar and smack
[1:43:45] him upside down
[1:43:47] why it was the cover-up that he'd been
[1:43:49] talking to Brother by Adam because his
[1:43:50] wife would go you've been talking to him
[1:43:53] how some women are you've been talking
[1:43:56] to him yeah well we have to talk to
[1:43:58] people every once in a while but I
[1:43:59] thought brother Brown he said look Love
[1:44:00] Will Conquer everything and I'm telling
[1:44:02] you when we get to when we get to that
[1:44:04] love right there that's not love that
[1:44:05] that a normal person has
[1:44:08] that's not filial love that's agape love
[1:44:12] and that's the epitome that's the love
[1:44:14] that Jesus had when he went to the cross
[1:44:16] and said not my will but thy will be
[1:44:18] done when he went and said I'm not going
[1:44:20] to save myself I'm going to save you
[1:44:22] that's the ultimate sacrifice
[1:44:25] but you know what we could do the same
[1:44:26] thing and and still die and go to hell
[1:44:31] but he had the Holy Ghost
[1:44:34] inside of him
[1:44:35] and he said that Lord I'm going to come
[1:44:39] back and I'm going to give it to them
[1:44:41] see I can't get my I can get my life for
[1:44:43] brother Aaron but I can't put my soul in
[1:44:44] him he probably wouldn't want him but so
[1:44:46] in him but the love of God
[1:44:49] the agape love that he had when he was
[1:44:51] on the cross that was the part that you
[1:44:53] are now and he was able to come back
[1:44:56] into a believer
[1:44:57] and that's why we believe in the New
[1:44:59] Birth here more than anything you if
[1:45:00] you're not born again you're lost
[1:45:02] you might be heading in the right
[1:45:04] direction that's fine but until you get
[1:45:06] sealed in Satan is right there with his
[1:45:08] grubby hands and he's going to claw you
[1:45:11] and do everything he can to get you but
[1:45:13] you know what greater is he that's in me
[1:45:15] than he that's in the world let's sing a
[1:45:17] song God bless you
[1:45:18] and I will not leave remember we don't
[1:45:21] need to get over there at four o'clock
[1:45:22] we need to get over there if you get
[1:45:24] over a little bit earlier I mean at 3
[1:45:25] 30. but that's okay but just don't go in
[1:45:28] the facility because there's not a lot
[1:45:29] of room but let's just eat about here
[1:45:31] and then leisurely take our drive over
[1:45:33] there so God bless you we love you with
[1:45:34] the love of the Lord thank you all of
