touch each one of us and keep us all safe amen so if you got your bibles we're going to be on eternal redemption part 11. go to hebrews 9 11 we'll read our scriptures run through these quotes pretty quick and i was gonna go we're getting into the sixth dimension but there's so much to that sixth dimension that uh there's one little place that we always forget but it's part of the plan of redemption and it's called paradise totally a part of redemption had to be put there and we're going to prove tonight and show why it had to be put there you couldn't just put the old testament saints into the sixth dimension because that's the born-again that's the genesis 1 26 man after they pass away here and go into another dimens sixth dimension right that is just for them so there's got to be a place for these other ones and thank god there was a plan an eternal plan that included the ones in paradise that died under the blood of bulls and goats amen so we'll look at that tonight hebrews 9 11 so let's bow our heads and talk to the author one time the heavenly father thank you for the day and hour you give us to live in lord as we were thinking yesterday and just kind of reminiscing on all the people that we know and the people that we've all come in contact with that we know around the world that are truly friends of ours and brothers and sisters in christ that we would have never met if it hadn't been for this message and lord but you because of this eternal plan lord it's kind of like a family reunion get together we know that there's family out there we just haven't met him all yet and if we don't meet him on this side we know we're going to meet him on the other side so lord you've set this thing up where as brother adam was saying there that right after the resurrection that we'll be 30 40 days just looking around to see if this one made it and that one made it then we're going to turn our eyes and we're going to focus our face on you lord because we'll meet you in the air and ever never to be away from you again lord we thank you for that father we know that this time that we're living in we are separated from you by the these dimensions and by these bodies that we live in but lord we know in in spirit and our soul we commune with you lord as much as we let you come in with us father we pray that you'd commune with us tonight lord you do the speaking of the word to the people may they receive something from you bless all the ones that are sick the ones that are needy lord the sin sick all the ones on this list right down below my feet on the wall lord we look at it sometimes and lord we want them all to come in we don't want to lose one of them father because they're connected to some family member in this church father we pray that you just be with us now and take care of us in the furthermore this service keep us safe in jesus name amen hebrews 9 verse 11 but christ being come a high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us you may be seated in the lord as blessing to the reading of the word but there had to be a part of redemption that had to be played by the old testament saints and there had to be a place for them to go there couldn't just be one where because they died under good faith and we'll read what the prophet says but let's continue through here and see just kind of go back and let's read this one from job 19 55 job being the oldest book in the bible let's read the red to save time redemption is one of the oldest things in the bible did you know redemption was even before the plan of redemption was laid out before the world was ever formed think of that look god foreseeing i keep looking at that word for seeing because that's foreknowledge by for knowledge this eternal plan you say well it had to have a beginning no it doesn't it's in the mind of god listen this plan of redemption was in the mind of god from you can't say when he started it always was because it can't change if it was the eternal thoughts of god now look there's eternal thoughts of god and there's thoughts of god and he's the only one who can keep them separated because me and you can remember everything we did back right bro donnie but now according to god he's put our sins in the sea of god forgetfulness never to be remembered again so some way he can wipe that out i don't know i can't say some way i know how he did it he's god and when he died at calvary we'll look at some some really wonderful quotes for brother um talks about what happened at calvary because that was where the mind of god was transferred to earth into a man named jesus and then jesus what did he do he did what god foresaw and his brother dale's been preaching this listen jesus had to come he didn't just say well now there'll be somebody may be born in bc4 that'll maybe he'll be the one i choose no that was god himself and being he wasn't he wasn't part of the plan he was the plan but he became and made himself part of the plan that would be like the guy that writes the play or writes the script for the movie and then he stars in the movie amen because god wrote the script saw it happen and played a big part in it because he had to die to fulfill god foreseeing and making a way of redemption before he even made the world that gave adam and eve a chance that gave even cain a chance to make it so that give everybody a chance to make it before he ever made the world for the bible plainly says that christ was predestinated for dane and was the lamb of god slain before the foundation of the world everybody understand that jesus it wasn't like jesus was he thought he might be god or he he just decided no see you and i are disconnected from that jesus came in human flesh predetermined that he was going to be here because he was a lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world it wasn't somebody that just come down here and received him like me and you we don't know who's saved and who's not saved or who's going to be saved and not saved but we know there had to be god almighty and human flesh according to the old testament which was several hundred scriptures telling us how he was going to get here and who he was and when he came according to that they hated him and killed him but that was part of the plan that was part of the plan for ordained and was the lamb of god there couldn't nobody else take the place we were talking about brother branham today at lunch we were talking about brother branham you know he he's the only one that could stand and preach some of the greatest sermons he ever preached knowing nobody in the whole congregation was ever understanding one thing he was saying all they wanted was to see the signs and wonders listen i was telling them today have you ever realized this brother ryan spent 40 something years brother luis tearing down the major doctrines of all the denominations of the world especially catholic how many of them dissolved and moved to the tabernacle zero zero now they was people come out of there people come out of those denominations but you would have thought if he tore that thing down and just tore the foundation apart of your denomination or your belief then you would go well we have no denomination let's close our headquarters and we're going to go with this guy no that's not what it but that wasn't part of the plan either because he said come out of her my people there had to be a her that even went all the way to the end time being the and the harlot daughters so see that was predetermined there had to be the they had to be the harlem daughters brother brown didn't come to dissolve that sure he come to destroy their doctrine but not one of them left its denominational whole they're still baptist still catholics and they're growing like crazy so who is it too it's to the select few mom raised their hand i'll raise my hand it was the to the select few even the people that were sitting there that time when the seals were were being preached by the rest is in the questions and answers on the seals and brother brown said it's not for you it's gone from you you're not even you're not even you're not even going to get it it's not even listen he said it's not even for you now that was 1963. you said well that was it it was done finished nobody's going to get it now no he said but no right around the coming of the lord these things will come together in other words and they'll be a a preacher unless titus 1 1 paul a servant of god an apostle of jesus christ according to the faith of god's elect and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness put this on 1.25 big boy in hope of eternal life which god that cannot lie promised before the world began but hath in due times manifested his word what through preaching the whole fivefold ministry not just one fold all five foals has to be given to perfect the saints unto me according which is committed unto me paul didn't have a problem i i'm you know i some people may thought brother trevor was a little bold somebody some people may think i am but you know what there's people that are chosen to take this thing and sweep it on to the coming of the lord i'm just dumb enough to believe that then i'm going to i'm going to connect myself to that and i'm going to give him what gift i have and let him use it for the glory of the lord amen and so you should be the same way we shouldn't be cocky or arrogant but we should be confident in that you're in the right message you're hearing the right word and you are born again and you are the bride of jesus christ now listen that takes everything else and puts it down low right but now if you build yourself up you got a problem see you build yourself up you got a problem but now who would look at paul though and paul said you're going to be judged by my gospel others would have thought paul was elevating because remember he even says i magnify my office right paul was a lo paul was a hook knows jew paul was jewish he had a little bit of maybe a little bit of quick temper but he was bringing a message that was going to solidify the early church that was going to take that early church and make it settle make it established go to ephesus and not worry about right here in ephesians 1 where we're talking about now let's go to there because this is to the ephesians he said look best blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame now that's pretty tough to take but we're chosen in him if you're chosen in him then you take whatever he's got that's what i get right having predestinated us into the adoption of children we're all listen adoption is predestinated adoption is predetermined because we have to have adopted sons and daughters of god to get out of here they did not need adopted sons and daughters of god in luther's day in wesley's day in pentecost that was not required but in this age it's required to go up that statue of a perfect man to go to adoption to go to the fullness of christ because we're talking about doing something no one has ever done before and that's taking a body change by what we have inside of us now look martin luther had the same holy ghost you've got but it could only work by what word that he could see and that god allotted for that time you understand what i'm saying god allotted so much for each age i read that quote to you a long time ago brother brown said each age was allotted what according to revelations 1-3 they were allotted ephesian church age and and like brother travis trevor said in the book each there was seven actual cities that were in asia minor call these different churches ephesus smyrna pergamos started sergeant and they fit the character of the people that was going to be in the age because look right here columba was from where he was from ireland he lived in ireland i don't even know that he left the whole of the island we don't know that but the thytara that thai tower city was over in asia minor but god took the characteristics of what that church what that city was matched it with by the prophet matched it with columbus character and the character of the people of that age because remember columbus died before his church age started so it had to be they couldn't press anyway their messenger died before the church age started so it had to be what yeah it had to be the preachers that took the message of columba and took it to the people amen i'm just as they say it might work there's a little girl worked there she said just saying you're just saying you know you look at it and you say well this church age messenger wasn't he meant his age but you know what though his preaching the character of his preaching though carried through that 1500 years columbus age was the largest age it was like almost it was a thousand years so those messengers had to carry through that those preachers behind pulpits and behind pulpit in that day meant you died if the romans came in the door but they preached it anyway and they got that to luther's age amen right so they persevered verse six to the praise of the glory of his grace we're in heaven made us what accepted in the beloved that's why i said before you and i cannot stand before judgment if we're chosen in christ we've already been judged when he went to calvary we've been we were judged all those that are in that sixth dimension they have been judged even those that were in paradise we'll read in just a minute i'll let brother brown explain to you let's let's look at verse 11. and him also we have obtained an inheritance being what predestinated there's that predestination now predestinate is right it's predetermined destiny but it's by what for knowledge according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will and we were talking about foreknowledge again just before i don't want to beat this to death but still we need to see this because if you just look at predetermined you can't read the message of the hour you can't and get it right because the way you look brother branham you look at one way he makes quotes it's like you could not go any other way you had you came here wheat you came here an eagle you came here well then i've got the quotes here was it no you came here a kookaburra so if you don't put them two together then you do have confusion i think about what trevor was saying the other day you know i don't blame some people for pla press and play they've heard so much junk out there of message preachers saying brother branham was wrong here or he did this or that over there they probably need to press play maybe to bring their self back but they will never get perfected by just pressing play because they can't go past the bible right the bible says for the perfecting of the saints he give a fivefold ministry and you know what you know there's no plan without you there's no predetermining without you there's no foreknowledge without you a plan is not a plan you you can you can draw up the best football plan in the world but you got to have 11 men on that and and guess what there's 11 other guys that have put their plan and they want to put it in force too right so that's the way it is with you and me we've got our plan satan's got his plan but we gonna win it may look bad every once in a while but we gonna win because this is the this is an eternal plan satan's plan may work for him and it is it's gonna take us it's gonna take the world into chaos amen that's what it's doing now but that plan has an end yes that plan comes to an end at the what white throne judgment and then the the burning in the in the fire that's where that ends and guess what we do we just go right into the future home and just keep right on going that eternal plan of redemption amen romans 8 verse 29 save time for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to what look you're not just predetermined you're predetermined to do something to be conformed to the image in other words to what's the image of god you say oh i said this is the image of god this forms every image that god ever has been ever will be in every every character every characteristic of god is right here now what'd the prophet do the prophet made sure the holy spirit through the prophet made sure that we saw the right picture because see the the denomination plan of redemption is different from ours you saw bro well why are we sitting here why aren't we saying blessed holy trinity and and baptize in the name of father son holy ghost and why aren't we believing in an eternal hell and why aren't we believing that we got to go through seven years of tribulation maybe three and a half here and three and a half over there but they still believe in a that you go through a tribulation period now that's their denominational idea we're different from that why because the prophet of god came and said this is it i was telling them before you know brother brown used many people uri smith clarence larkin all these different ones he even used scofield listen brother brother is not the one that came up with theophany scofield's got it right here before brother brown even was born almost brother brown read it though but you can read scofield and scofield somewhere in here in his footnotes he says see the trinity is laced all through the bible he was trinitarian he had that trinitarian idea but brother branham gleaned from this one gleaned from that one very well-read individual and he read all these but you know what he done he took it back to god he remember he took it back to the word and that's what you and i are supposed to do take it back to the word for whom he did for know he did predestinate what to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren watch moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called whom he called them he justified and whom he justified then he also glorified because you got to remember we're going to read here in a few minutes you and i go through justification sanctification of baptism the holy ghost to get the new birth the old testament saints were justified under the blood of bulls and goats but not saved not holy ghosts feel now they uh and i thought there might have been a pushback a couple of sundays ago when i was at brother richard heist and he don't mind me saying because we talked about afterward he said that was marvelous how you brought it out and i said well it's true john the baptist the bible says he got the holy ghost from his mother's womb but that whole that baptism of the holy ghost and your birth is different there is a difference in the baptism of the holy ghost because you can have the baptism of the holy ghost on your spirit every day of your life and die and go to hell but you can't have the new birth in your soul and die and go to hell so john was anointed by the holy ghost to do his job because i'm gonna prove right here he was in paradise i found that quote i've never seen it before brother brown said there was john in paradise with abraham isaac he was an old testament prophet they're bound right with that we know that but a lot of people didn't know that and sometimes people cross their eyes we've had many discussions donnie's had one with a brother a preacher in the message that said that oh no they got the new birth in the old testament just like we did i just walked away because there wasn't no needing me doing anything i was going to see what he'd do he lived through it maybe he didn't change the brother's mind but still you can't do that you can't have the savior or the the salvation of that kind of salvation before the savior because the bible says the death has to be a death of the testator to become a new testament the old testament was like the bosom of abraham it was the faith of abraham it was the faith of those ten commandments and all the laws and the prophets we'll read it in a second but see that's not what we're living under excuse me let's go to number three we'll skip through these if y'all don't mind brother bob's working back there he can get it how can i take a kuga bear and make a grain of wheat out of it it's impossible for me to do it the only way it can be is because inside that kookaburra has been transmitted from a cuckoo bird wheat a cuckoo bird to a germ called wheat life then you bury that cocker burn and produce a grain of wheat listen we buried a lot of fu birds around here but you'll never see that crocodile again because that transforming power of what was inside of them is in that sixth dimension well when that six dimension person comes back into this dimension because we're going to read here in a minute look excuse me when samuel died and went across excuse me whatever you want to call it we shouldn't eat that much across the curtain of time and he comes back he's samuel still with a robon and they recognize who he is he was in a dream condition just like brother brown said so he didn't change to a young man nope he did not because i'll prove to you in just a minute brother brown even when when jesus went to paradise there was there was um abraham and sarah but he says when they resurrected he said they were young see when they resurrected not while they were in paradise paradise is just a holding place and that's why and listen to me that's very important where would you have put those people that plan we know it's perfect but you keep looking at it and you go man he thought of everything they he thought of everything and it's perfect then you bury that cuckleberry to produce a grain of wheat because there has been a life of wheat put in that kookaburra and we know that because that's what what happened at the new birth then this new life has been fully developed out of the ground and raised up again when it comes back no more cockapoo but wait but while it's here on the earth kokober still sticky but it's got the nature on the inside of that wheat amen right and he talks about having a carnal nature so let's go let's jump on through here real quick we know what the first three dimensions were they were life light time and matter and we're all now caught in that dimension and listen even when jesus came into this dimension he was caught here there was no recording of him traveling through walls now there's a couple of times that he said that he disappeared in the crowd i believe he just changed their vision just like just like they did in the old testament remember here stands elisha here stands gaza elisha said there's more force than against us and he's just going one two one two one two ten thousand one two ten thousand what elisha say lord open his eyes now look those angels were already there they didn't develop they were already there because the prophet saw him he just said open my servant's eyes because remember what happened in that situation elisha went to the syrians and said who are you looking for they said we're looking for elijah he said come here i'll show you where he's at it was him god had changed their vision to where they didn't see who he was because remember when they get over right in the middle of the camp of the israelites what'd god do open their eyes they listen their eye wasn't shut they just couldn't see what was going on so i believe jesus just changed their changed their vision a little bit and he just walked right remember they won't throw him off a cliff and they were going to do all these things he just disappeared in the crowd if we're going to make it to a body change that may be what's going to happen to me in you amen that's the speaking condition that's the adoption that's to having supreme power in control not out of control amen then luke 16 is proved that abraham said son remember that thy lifetime you receive as good things like lazarus evil things you understand this is where lazarus is over here rich young rulers over here but they can't cross each other there is a boundary there even in the even in the paradise versus hell there's a gulf there that they couldn't cross back and forth to but the witch of endor could call samuel up and then he could look behind samuel and he said i see gods she said i see gods raising up out of the earth brother brown said she opened up that portal in those that dimension and she saw everything but you can't do that now he said you can't do that now because we'll read it in just a minute so that's luke 16. we know that you cannot pass from one dimension to the other we're stuck in this dimension until god takes us out of here amen until death takes us into another dimension or until we take a body change we are stuck here but you know what it's part of the plan because right here on this earth is where we're going to prove that there is a god we're going to prove there is a plan of redemption we're going to prove that a kuckleberg can be changed into a wheat we're going to prove that god as brother trevor was saying this is god's body there's no other body on the earth this is god's body he doesn't even step foot here until the millennium we go to meet him right because there'd be two bodies on the earth at the same time as we were talking about all right let's go to the next one john 12 28 became a voice from heaven saying i both glorified it and glorified it again people therefore stood by and heard it and said it thundered others said an angel spake to me we were talking today about the the great opening of the seals and i believe that's what happened they just heard a voice not say listen not de-christianizing anyone that was setting during those seals or any time under brother brown's message you understand me they were in their time in their place born again amen but not being able to get the full revelation of the open book some of them probably still didn't you know after even brother brown left they never some called him a prophet some say well he's just a good preacher with a gift because you know what they turned around went right back into the denomination they were in when he died so what they didn't get a full revelation of what was going on so same thing i believe there where jesus is standing on the earth he's preached his sermon this is when he's getting ready to leave and god was talking to him god was talking to brother branham he many people heard the voice but they didn't get or heard the thunder but they didn't get the voice behind it because that part of the plan is and we're going to see here in a few minutes that when jesus cried with a loud voice it said it was finished amen all right now look that's the first three dimensions we talked about the sound barrier we know about that that when you break the sound barrier that it almost shakes the bolts think about me and you the same way but after that you know it gets a little better but after you break the sound barrier there's always a noise and there's always a cloud fourth dimension let's look at that science the tree of knowledge i'm going to try to get through this because i want to get to the other part pretty quick now we have contact through science to fourth dimension as it was because coming right through this building now comes pictures voice of radio pictures on television that our senses can't contact now you can't contact it but it can influence you remember we were talking the other day about the subliminal messages i you know they had to cut that out because they were doing that in movies they were flashing up coca-colas you know and popcorn and all that stuff and you're wondering why i just ate two cheeseburgers at mcdonald's why am i hungry and why am i thirsty well that's a blend why your subconscious was catching that because it was faster than your eye could contact remember your hands are even faster than your eyes a hand is quicker than the eye amen so now look we have contact through that but they have a tube or a crystal to pick up the ether waves then we're going to get to the question and answers on the seals you'll get to in just a little bit maybe on your trip back to to the the coast believers don't go to the beach believers go to the coast don't forget that there's no sense in our body can detect number six our television over the ether waves yet right through us us now is coming people's voices now i like what brother brown said because look that device doesn't create the image the image is there i've got to take this device to take your picture and send it somewhere else but you're who you are it's not that you now listen this end time photoshop and all those different things yeah they just about almost create you but back when brother brown was talking about it you couldn't do that you couldn't manipulate um pictures like that so what he was saying was it had to be something that's what i believe he's talking about questions and answers on the seals he said something's going on something he said the voice of god is in this building now the literal voice of god but who was picking it up he said it's gone from you let's read that let's go right down to number eight don't make yourself odd to be a christian because you see you take yourself away from god and you you you there's that you you you and you you you if you can understand it this is that third pull see you kind of stuttered on that we're talking about brother i'm stuttering seeing what god would have him to say you should have caught that the other day you remember there'll be no impersonation like there was of the other two see so that's as far as you you should know now just remember that you see now there's something taking place in this room now he's pretty specific he said there's something taking place in this room in other words that's the tabernacle while he's preaching there's something going on and that's pretty um you know they should have went man where is it what's going on but watch so that's as far as you should know now just remember that you see now there's something taking place in this room and there's something here there's there's actual in this room angels voice of god not just an angel's voice voice of god but how you you can't he's he's trying he he's trying he's trying not to tell them it ain't for them but he's going to anyway later on but watch what he's but look how do you you you can't uh now watch if you can't hear the natural voice without something to send it out how are you going to hear the spiritual voice exactly right now you might make believe that somebody is singing this certain song mate believe there's no make believing god you might may believe he's preaching on something besides what he's preaching on but now watch this that might not even be there see but when it actually strikes the crystal that it's supposed to strike that it's supposed to strike not any crystal not any crystal in the spectrum of all the different different waves and different things no there's one when it actually strikes the crystal that it's supposed to strike look then it gives a true interpretation and vindicates it by showing the picture vindicates it by showing the picture what is the picture this is the picture that wasn't the picture they weren't getting the seals you and i are getting the seal amen it vindicates it by showing the picture see what i mean now the spirit of god look watch this now the spirit of god when it speaks through the true word it vindicates itself to show itself that it's right you understand now he said all right which they probably didn't and look not belittling those people at all i'm just telling you they had a time and a place i want to ask you something though are you stuck back there no come on are you stuck back there under what god sent a prophet you got to ask yourself that question are you stuck back there with them going oh god set a prophet all we got to do is press play that's stuck in another time and it's not the right crystal this is the right crystal today you're hearing not just from me you're hearing by a five-fold ministry you're hearing the right crystal now do you have the right right crystal to take it right because you got to be cut the same as the one that's sending it or you can't pick it up so we got to be cut the same but thank god there is a fourth dimension it's a horrible time brother brown said you know even demons and and cancer and all that travels in the fourth dimension but so does god so does his angels they free travel through the fourth dimension it's just according to what you listen to and what you let go down to here from here to here all right now we talked about the fifth dimension which is hell all right everybody got that now the fifth dimension is where the sinner the unbeliever dies and goes to now look the fifth the fifth dimension is kind of well the horrible dimension now and when a christian dies he goes into the sixth dimension and god is in the seventh dimension we'll cover those a little bit later now then you see the christian when he dies he goes under the altar of god look right into the presence of god now look be careful with that because you don't go into the presence of the almighty person of god everybody understand that because remember when brother branham will read it next sunday when brother brown goes in the sixth dimension he said where's jesus he said i want to see him he said you can't see him now he's high or what he's in a faster dimension than even what brother brown had got himself into which was way faster than where his body was laying back down there about 20 feet below him now the fifth dimension now you see the christian when he dies he goes under the altar of god right into the see that is the presence of god we feel the presence of god here but that is the presence of god in that sixth dimension there's not good days and bad days there's not trouble in heartaches and trials one day and sunny day is the next no you've went into the presence of god as much as you're going to get until god himself comes but listen let's take it while we can take every bit of what we can because we're sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus the bible tells us all right now look to break it down when a man has a nightmare he's not altogether asleep neither is he awake something like some of y'all that are sitting here right now he's between sleeping awake and not you no you're good he ate he said he ate too much sweets he might take a nap so you all just be bear with him i told him if he did it quietly it wouldn't matter most y'all do the same thing and that's what makes him have a horrible shaking and screaming because he's not asleep and he's not awake to take that and to take that shows where a man goes when he dies unconverted he's lived his time out now listen right here you say well now all those old testament saints they weren't born again so they must have been no they're not there they're not in a horrible place they didn't they were not unconverted they were converted for their time they had faith for their time they believed in their prophets they believed listen i'll read this in just a minute i'm going to read all these quotes where brother brown talks about look when jesus we we dwell on when jesus went to hell and preached to the souls in prison that were that repent did not repent in the long suffering of the days of of noah right so that was before the flood all those people that were that that were unconverted he preached to them but now remember there was a converted group down there called paradise because he didn't stop and go from hell all the way back up and rows on in this dimension no he had to stop and pick up the ones that were converted so there was an unconverted bunch but remember the converted bunch had several that were before the flood because there was eight souls that were saved right i don't argue with the prophet i don't know about ham but you don't understand what i mean but i'll read it to you in just a minute you argue with that but you know what we're not to argue about things like that because that really has nothing to do with our salvation but it does show the plan of redemption and how it works down through the time all right is everybody okay with that so to break it down a man goes dies unconverted he's lived his time up he's dead on earth and he cannot go in the presence of god because he's not fit to go there without the blood now remember now you can put paradise in that group because brother brown is going to say they can't go in the presence of god because the blood of bulls and goats covers their sin they still took it with them until christ come and emptied paradise apparent to me paradise is wonderful because it was a group of people that never saw jesus never never saw jesus christ kind of like the fifth sealed jew didn't care about that i mean they didn't know i didn't say they don't care but but they least listen to their prophet and and they died realizing that something was coming right job said i know my redeemer liveth and six thousand or five thousand years later here he come but he before even that happened he was waiting isaiah ezekiel we'll read it in just a minute he cannot come back to earth he's caught because his time's finished here on earth and he's caught between he's in a nightmare now remember hell's not burning we already read that i think we'll read it here again he can't go in the presence of god to rest could you imagine dying all them years ago and you can't rest boy those in the sixth dimension we're just resting kind of like some of y'all now resting with your eyes closed but now them in the fifth dimension i promise you they're not sleeping they know they're in a wrong place and he's caught he cannot come back to earth because his time's finished and he's caught between he's in a nightmare see he can't go in the presence of god to rest he can't back come to earth because his time's up he's in a nightmare and there he stays until the day of judgment a horrible thing to be in see first peter 3 verse 18 says for christ also hath once suffered for sin the just for the unjust that he might bring us to god being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison which sometimes were disobedient who wants the long-suffering of god what's the long-suffering god 120 years man preached one sermon not go up to that's your perfect man not wait on the seals it's gonna rain get ready to get in the ark it's gonna rain while the ark was preparing wearing few that is eight souls were saved by water look at number 10 souls are in prison now prophet god said now jesus after he'd finished his ministry watch this preach to those souls that were unsavable how did he know that for knowledge listen if he hadn't had foreign knowledge how big would that boat had to be that boat only held eight human beings and whatever two of each kind that was it ever how big it is if i was no i'd be going lord how can we get all these people because you know like brother brown said there were some that didn't believe none at all and there were some that kind of hung around the door i mean noah's got man you've got to get in this ark i don't know where we're going to put you but see god knew that at the very end as soon as he shut that door he knew there was nobody else same way with the gentile door once he shuts that door there'll be no other gentiles say but he knows who that is all right they were unsavable they could not ever be saved see there's the foreknowledge of god that if he'd give them all a million years put them past the flood down to this day they still would not repent they would deny what you're listening to right now they would deny jesus just like caiaphas did that same denial spirit didn't die on that side of the flood it came right on over here in ham and all the different ones and all the way down nimrod and all the different ones down that way because brother brown said people die spirits known that same spirit that persecuted jesus went over and persecuted the jews listen when mercy was given to them they spurned mercy now they're waiting for the judgment oh what a time that must have been oh i wish there was some way i could shake the world with that to let them see what the reality is souls in prison paragraph 108 let's go to number 11. but after the days of his preaching his ministry continued on because the last group he preached to was the souls that were in hell that could not be forgiven i have clearly read that from the bible from ii peter he went and preached to the souls that were in prison which is hell locked up until the day of judgment because you see the judgment isn't now and there's no burning hell now see that's another thing your denominationals think when once you're once you're dead and you go to hell you're burning no they don't know nothing about a fifth dimension or a sixth dimension or fourth dimension thank god it took a profit to go into every one of them basically to tell us what was going on because brother byron said i was in both places i remember at jcpenney's and that and when he was falling when he was a kid he was falling remember and he said god saved me because you see the judgment isn't now and there is no burning hell now somebody tell you the guy is in burning hell now that's wrong see a judge of this earth is just just enough to never condemn a man until he's brought to trial and god will never throw a man into the fiery furnace until first he is condemned by god's own laws he rejected mercy so you see he first has to have a trial and the trial is the great white throne judgment but now he's in a place called a prison house so he's locked in the fifth dimension can't get out of the fifth dimension all right so let's look at the sixth dimension real quick hope that wasn't too fast for you let's see if you put that on 1.25 but i want to get to this right here because i was going to go jump into the sixth dimension but i thought no let's talk about paradise for a minute because it's very important because it helps to see the true doctrine that nobody in the old testament was saved as we are saved now they're justified under the blood of bulls and goats but they're not born again okay they're put in a place but watch this now the sixth dimension i'm going to talk just for a second now the sixth dimension is christ in christ the saints dead saints are look resting saints who is completely work finished on earth and has entered into rest with christ under the altar beautifully you could parallel parallel it like a wonderful dream that you didn't want to wake up from now that's a big contrast to the ones that want to wake up in the fifth dimension but look it ain't a dream that's kind of southern but this ain't a dream it's natural it's real but i'm just making a parable for you because the seventh dimension is god alone so now we're going to talk about paradise and let's go to luke 23 verse 42 because paradise was before the sixth dimension see there was not a six dimension saints dimension anywhere in the old testament okay because there was no new birth that eradicated their sins so they couldn't go in the presence of god these people in the sixth dimension they had their sins eradicated on earth by what accepting jesus christ jesus christ cleaned their soul out and made them a what a wheat and that wheat is what went into the sixth dimension the kuckleberg had to stay here because the cuckoo bear's not going yet right they got to come back and get the huckleberry but once they come into that body new body which is the body they live then it's made new all right everybody okay with that because remember there's no transmigration of souls you can't take this soul and put it over here no you're connected with when you're given a soul when you're born that's you that's right that carries you either to heaven or hell luke 23 verse 42 why in the world would jesus resurrect in the body he was beat up in nail scars if it didn't mean something he stayed and actually he stayed in the exact body he's in all right and he said unto jesus lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom now watch jesus had to correct him because remember the kingdom is the baptism of the holy ghost watch what jesus said though this is the thief on the cross right before he died i told him i said you know there's been a lot of people in paradise brother russ but now this guy this thief he wasn't in paradox but about a day and a half because he came up you know with him and went on into into glory now watch jesus said unto him verily i say unto thee today today because they died the same day today shalt thou be with me in paradise so there was paradise the bosom of abraham what we saw where lazarus was in that condition after he died because lazarus wasn't in the sixth dimension lazarus wasn't a born again believer maybe he was after jesus died but this lazarus we're talking about is old testament you got to remember listen even jesus died under the old testament but he said this is the new testament in my blood it had to be when he come out of the grave that was a new testament the testator had died the old testator had died and now a new testament the book of acts had to come into being and there stephen was the first martyr so he was the first one to step into that sixth dimension had it already prepared because you know what jesus said jesus said my kingdom's come my kingdom is what my kingdom is right here so what do you do when he come back on the day of pentecost he brought the kingdom back he brought the holy ghost back but it wasn't that the holy ghost could go and anoint somebody it could go into peter not anoint peter peter had a problem with a few things temper patience that's why i believe peter wrote ii peter about how to go up that statue of perfect man because peter had to get rid of every one of them peter was a prime example i i no lord i'll cut i'll i'll hack them into let them touch you one time jesus said before the croc rooster crows one three times you'll deny me you know why because peter didn't have the kingdom inside of him he was talking to the kingdom and the kingdom was saying look you got some work to do we got to work on you but you know what peter i prayed for you and i like what it said when he went to the tomb he said go get my disciples and peter because he knew peter was probably over there somewhere going man he told me i was going to deny him three times i wonder peter didn't go crazy but he didn't because he had a commission now let's look at number a this is demonology in 1953. now this witch of endor she called up the spirit of samuel and saul talked to samuel so there must be something that dimension was not exactly all the way set because she brought him up and she saw him and saul saw him and saul could talk to him kind of like lazarus than the rich young ruler they could talk to each other but they couldn't go and move from one place to the other everybody got that saying ma'am if you say a man a few times you won't go to sleep amen amen amen okay you might wonder how that could be done watch now we heard with our own ears a man stand up somewhere in up north and tell us that that's the reason brother adam can come back it's because of that right there did we not hear that those of you that went with us to that place up north heard it with our own ears the little guy was just a little arrogant dude he said see there samuel was brought back from another dimension of course they were trying to push their brother brown is going to come back that's under the blood of bulls and goats it can be done the prophet they say is going to come back we'll tell you in just a minute that it can't be done anymore because he said that's catholicism whoa that's communing with saints all right listen it cannot be done today no sir he just answered it now you might wonder how that could be done it cannot be done today no sir because the blood of bulls and goats was only a waiting for the time of what fulfillment when a man died in them days preachers back me up if you think is right when a man died he died under the atonement of an animal and his soul went into paradise and there he stayed until that to the to the day of redemption and his soul was in there so it wasn't just some spiritual thing it was his soul it was that person all right now look demonology number b now this brother i'll tell you something we need to be skinned down and rubbed a little bit to see where we're standing amen don't you think so make right right any person look if those saints now i'm not condemning catholic saints but look listen to this look the reason that the witch of endor could call the spirit of samuel because samuel couldn't go into the presence of god if they bring if they think can't bring william branham back into this dimension then our prophet never went in the presence of god that's what they're saying because samuel couldn't go into the presence of god and that little guy he just laid it out with a witchman door called samuel up everybody recognized him and he was the problem is samuel never got into this dimension right he was talking to saul saul was in this dimension the timeline matter the three dimensions but now he called she called him from another dimension watch now look i'm losing my voice i have to talk one talking 1.0 i'm not condemning catholic saints but look the reason that the witch of endor could call the spirit of samuel because samuel couldn't go into the presence of god he was in paradise for the blood of bulls and goats would not take away sin now it didn't make them sinners but their sin was covered only covered it was still there but since jesus died he divorced sin and taken away sin and the believer now goes into the presence of god and he can't come back he can't come back jesus said in luke when he was talking about the rich man he can't return so if you're interceding with any kind of spirit of someone that's gone on outside of god christ the only mediator between god and man then you're in spiritualism called religion now where is spiritualism at so be careful what you say about the spirit of god communion with saints is spiritualism i'm not making that up i'm reading it right from the prophet of god now let's read this one right here demonology owensboro kentucky he preached demonology and yeah that's from your hometown demonology here he comes climbing up brother she's coming near daylight i can see the big morning star looking around the grave already amen he can tell a story make it so real it's coming on the third day hallelujah wait he's got somebody else over here in paradise so he don't forget nobody pass me not old gentle savior hear my humble cry over here in paradise lay some souls abraham isaac jacob sarah and those who've been faithful look believing the promise of the prophets and they're laying there waiting with only the blood of bulls and goats look a shadow or a type of his own blood i can see him go up to paradise brother i'm not knocked on the door so there must have been a a space there right rich young ruler can't get in lazarus can't get out but when jesus knocks on the door here's the reason they're there abraham the faith of abraham or the bosom of abraham is what they call it abraham to open the door who are you he said i am the seed of abraham i can hear daniel say what that's the stone i've seen hewed out of a mountain without hands now look they never saw jesus they saw him in simple form but every one of them in paradise abraham said sarah that's the man we fed the calf to melchizedek ezekiel said what i saw him coming with such speed to it looked like he was powerful with a dust under his feet what the wheel in the middle of the wheel i can hear one prophet say i wrestled with this man all night at the river before i crossed hallelujah now look john the different ones recognized him that's john the baptist because john the baptist was put in paradise when he died as great as john was because remember jesus said and i didn't bring that quote but you ought to know what jesus said he said the least in the kingdom was greater than john why because john didn't have the new birth right john had the baptism of the holy ghost an anointing but he's in this same place that all these other people are amen so that proves if you don't if you if you didn't believe it maybe you ought to believe it now that the people in the old testament did not have the new birth even john listen that sixth dimension is only four that genesis 1 26 promised children of god that was before the foundation of the world god said i'm going to put a man right here in this place and i'm not going to move them they ain't going to want to come back here until the people that are here conquer death john the different ones recognized him all right look in 1964 questions and answers number two know there's a time that the people didn't go into the presence of god when they died look they're justified they were justified they believed on not the lord jesus christ but who who was talking to them the lord jesus in jehovah or in whatever you want to call him the old testament jehovah god they were speaking of that jehovah god which dad jehovah god was jesus christ they went what look that was in the old testament they went into a place called paradise and there the souls of the just waited in paradise but paradise was a place where god kept the souls in like a dreamland not at rest i don't think not turn back to young man and woman because samuel wasn't moses and elijah they recognized them they must not have been turned back why jesus christ hadn't come to totally eradicate that sin until the look kept the souls in their dream land until the blood of jesus christ was shed for the blood of bulls and goats would not take away sin it only covered up sin but jesus's blood takes away sin you notice that when he died at calvary and on his return let me let me make sure i read this right excuse me what number of my own number i got them all c d number d right right there we go and you notice when he died at calvary on his return he brought out from the grave those dead saints that had died under the atonement of blood of bulls and goats and heifers and they entered into the city and appeared to many now we know that they came out of paradise paradise was emptied up let me read this one right here because this one is really neat number e let me tell you what happened this wasn't a quiet scene probably on easter morning that graveyard was as quiet as it could be wasn't nothing stirring at all but buddy in another dimension there was something going on watch this no wonder it brings emotions no wonder the human heart cannot contain it oh with our conquering faith we can stand yonder and say we're justified forever freely because he died and was buried and god raised him up again on easter morning then god showed that it was accepted all the things that he did everything freely paid you can go free now rising he justified freely forever all no one can never know can never think of that great day when he rose up and the angel saw it and the heavens of heavens the angels sang the praises of god and rejoiced while the old testament saints in paradise shouted hallelujah rising you justifying the heavens shook the earth shook paradise shook and i know hell shook because remember he went to hell first took the keys from the devil and his little his little angels looked around and said we got a leader that can't even get us in our house anymore amen because jesus took them all hell shook when that great voice come forth up from the grave he arose rising he justified freely forever oh my let's look at the future home death doesn't change you death only changes your dwelling place remember samuel when he was dead and been buried for two years he was in paradise and the witch of endor called him up and looked and saul recognized him it must have been somebody he knew two years ago not 40 or 50 or 80 years ago and the winston which vendor called him up and saw recognized him and she did too and fell upon her face he hadn't changed one bit he was still the same samuel after being dead two years he was still a prophet he said tomorrow you'll fall in battle your son with you and by this time tomorrow night you'll be with me and that's just what happened see and when moses returns back in elijah for revelations 11 there'll still be prophets all right let's listen to this right here this is we'll stop right here now remember brother brown talks about the different raptures there's more than just one you got it there's more than just one there's about four one we're going to talk about one two is us three is 144 000 and four is the general resurrection right the old testament saints has gone into its presence paradise done away and the old testament saints ascended up at his loud voice when he screamed and gave up the ghost why the sacrifice the perpetuation of their sins that they had waited on believing that perfect lamb was coming see they believed their prophets just like we should believe our prophet not that he's coming back he's already brought it because why the sacrifice the perpetuation of their sins that they had waited on believing that perfect lamb was coming they had offered the sacrifice the lamb and when he died and yielded up the ghost he screamed with a loud voice and the old testament saints awoke look watch the shout and the voice because remember the second coming he comes shout voice trump shout voice and same thing that is coming yielded up the ghost and when he did the sacrifice was perfect paradise was emptied out of the old testament saints came to the earth again walked around on the earth and entered in with him at his rapture but now let's continue on same just keep going david said over there lift up your everlasting gates and be lifted up he let captive captive give gifts unto men the old testament saints went in with him they said who is this king of righteousness the lord of glory mighty and host mighty host here they come in marching now look watch what happens because i want we need to stop here and look at something jesus led captivity captain and here he comes with the old testament saints and went in the new gates up there and said lift up the everlasting gates be lifted up let the king glory come in the voice came from the inside who is the king of glory the lord mighty in battle the gates fall open now listen that has nothing to do with a future home because he's taken the old testament saints that has nothing to do with the future home what is the future home it's for the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride and these people are not bride if you're not born again you're not bride john was not bride john the baptist sorry john the revelator was john the baptist was not anybody got that even abraham he's not considered bride right he has a part he has a place but he's not bride the lord mighty in battle so so look what are you saying brother way that's not the ho that's not the city john saw coming down in revelation 22. that must be another place that they're being held at but i believe they if paradise is emptied out then they did change back and they went somewhere and they're waiting on me and you according to hebrews 11 40. they without us cannot be made perfect sure they're in a condition but they're not perfect how can you make somebody that died under the blood of bulls and goats that never knew jesus christ more perfect than me and you are before us can't happen not part of the plan right well i didn't get many amens on that not part of the plan you talked about yeah no they're not proud part of the bride plan they're part of the whole eternal plan of redemption they will be there but listen it's not recorded anywhere that they're going to be in the city with us you've got your 12 patriarchs you've got your 12 tribes of israel i mean you're 12 apostles and 12 prophets but there's no recording that abraham's going to live in the city there's no recording that isaiah is going to live in the city because that city is only for the bride now they're part of the economy of god no more no less right but they're not going to live in that city because brother brown said only in that city that city is made what by the bride by her desire now i want god god's going to brag on us i'm not bragging on me i'm bragging on what god's already done right the lord mighty in battle the gates flew open and jesus a conqueror led captive captive then they had believed on him and the word had come to them there the old testament saints laying in their waiting he led captivity captive ascended on high took the old testament saints and went in there is one rapture already past that was a rapture of the old testament saints yes sir they are somewhere but they are not in the sixth dimension and they are not in a future home where are they i don't know i can't name a name of a place but i'll promise you they're not going to be perfected until me and you get perfected why part of the plan don't tell me listen there's a lot of things we did in our life but i've never had my best friend killed so i could take his wife i've never killed an egyptian i've never went into a and had children you see what i'm saying that's what the old testament was because that was types and shadows they had to do that to type all that the way down through here but when the blood of jesus christ takes away sin and takes it out of your life he doesn't just cover it he takes it away and when he takes it away you're not a murderer anymore you're not a thief anymore i'm sorry any of that yeah the future home is for the bride and the bride and jesus christ alone now the millennium is different that's why there's a difference in part of the millennium and in the future home now in the millennium they can be a lot of things we're there on a honeymoon there's a there's a fifth sealed jew there's 144 thousand don't know about the others you understand what i'm saying but that's not our home our home is coming in revelation 22 after god destroys every bit of this and after god takes all those demons and destroys them in the lake of fire then we come back now watch what is the second resurrection what is the second resurrection it's a resurrection not of them that we just talked about musicians get ready to come not them right there they're in another compartment sure jesus eradicated their sin anything that was against them has been covered i'm not covered eradicated but they were not bribed because they did not receive the new birth while they were here on earth you and i as the bride of jesus christ we receive christ into our soul here on earth we have to pass away that's okay but there's somebody gonna come to a place the shout the voice and the trumpet just like it was in the old testament but what are we gonna do i wrote myself a little footnote what is the sixth dimension that we're gonna talk about it's the bride that's gone on right that is the second resurrection because the second resurrection is not the jews it's not the old testament saints the second resurrection is the dead in christ shall rise first and we which are alive so what is the second coming the live bride and the bride that's went on that's coming back into this dimension that is your second coming the only reason we're going to make it is because of three things the shout the voice and the trumpet of god amen that's all they bought listen they've had their time in that sixth dimension there's there's millions in that sixth dimension they've never heard of william branham millions probably out of 50 million 45 of them never heard of him but brother brown don't save your soul jesus christ the everybody knew who he was in that dimension amen because they accepted him in this dimension so they're waiting they heard their shout voicing trump but it was impartiality because they had to pass away and go over into this part because you know what look we'll read it next sunday paul has his shout he listen paul didn't paul didn't preach brother brown's message the fullness you understand what i mean irenaeus martin because brother brown gets into that sixth dimension and he looks and he says did paul make it well now you'd think if they were all in the sixth dimension together paul's people would come running up to brother branham and and irena's people would come but why did brother rum have to say did paul make it he didn't see him but what he said he said if paul made it i mean yeah paul made it now angel said yes and i think he said well i know i'll make it because i preach the same thing paul did and remember brother branham's group said we're resting on that they're resting on let me just put it this way let's stand musicians coming and i'm not making anything out of us but i'm telling you those who are alive and remain are special those that have went on have completed a journey they're done they're finished they don't need a seventh seal to change their body this is the listen the seals didn't open in the sixth dimension the seals didn't open in heaven the seals opened in the first three dimensions right here so this is where it's going to have to culminate it's not going to culminate there because they're saying we're they said we're resting on that right what is that we are that we're resting on brother brown what you said now you got to go back we'll read it sunday because brother brown wanted to stay he said no no they said they told him you gotta go back in other words you're not finished that was 1960. he hadn't even revealed the sales yet he hadn't got into the great mystery that he got into in 63 64 and 65. they said you got to go back amen your your race your race is not finished he said do i have to go back to that seeing his body laying there at 50 something 50 years old i think or something like that angel said you know your work's not done yet right you got to go back now listen he came back and gave us a message that's going to get him out of there because now he is in there and his body's laying up there in jeffersonville that don't be little nothing nobody and those that have gone on but there is a group of people that will take the shout the voice and the trumpet and put them all three together because remember three is completion right three is perfection so three is perfect so the perfect in threes all right you and i have to take the shout the voice and the trumpet and we have to make it so real that they don't say just we're resting on that they're saying we're resting on us because the dead saints are dependent on me and you god in me and you to bring them back into this dimension but they'll never come back into this dimension brother us until death has been destroyed by somebody why would you come from a place of perfect peace back into they know what this is like brother brown said do i have to go back to that they say yep you do you got to go back we can't but you got to go back well now he's over there and he can't get back here without somebody's help his message in a group of people to shout the voice and trump of god not not to uh well never mind i'm gonna cover that he's done his work trevor read it this afternoon this weekend he said under her messenger she will be the final voice what the shout the trump is going to create a resurrection and that's what we're looking at we're looking at a resurrection message we just keep walking just keep walking because listen folks just as jesus came to shout voice trumpet to bring the old testament under his wing and he took them somewhere right now remember they weren't his body right think abraham isaac that's not his body but he took them somewhere though and dropped them off and he's waiting in the seventh dimension because he can't come back here anymore remember he came here one time with his body in him when he come back the second time or he coming back on the day of pentecost he sent the holy ghost to create his body amen to create his body therefore now he can't come back here his body's already here we become connected to him and we go what meet him in the air then we all come back in the millennium because see then we're his body flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone that's what we got to look at flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone let's sing a song god bless you paradise was a wonderful thing but when we get in that sixth dimension it's gonna be even better amen no breaking [Music] gentile days numbered with horrors and cumbers eternity soon will unfold the day of redemption is near men's hearts are failing for fear one raptor's already finished filled with the spirit jesus has something to do with it this rapture coming up his body's gonna have something to do with it the fig tree is jerusalem see we're watching seeing what

but he just said watch him he didn't say go over there and get him involved in it he said watch israel watch russia look at all these names that the prophet brought in that we're watching now watching russia doing what they're doing watching rome we know it's going to all end up in catholicism we know that many are mistaken it's not a mystery how this is going to end up because it's going to end up with us that's being squeezed out the power that's shaking and christ going to the jews through two prophets [Music] redemption is near men's hearts are failing for fear be filled with a spirit your

foundation of the world and it's all now being played out before your bride and lord i believe this ought to give us more confidence than it did a month ago a week ago a year ago it should give us a daily confidence that we are walking in the truth that we are walking in the light of the word that we're walking as a scr as the song says where the apostles have trod we're walking through what they saw and lord i thank you for the things you've given us lord i pray that you'd be with us take care of us on the highways be with us rest of the week keep these sicknesses away from us keep our pastor

resurrection we honor it every week every sunday we think of the resurrected jesus christ and that's the only way we can make it folks from week to week is to realize that he has risen not going to rise but he's already risen and we should be risen and sitting in heavenly places with him thank you for all things lord we ask you blessings in jesus name amen you're dismissed [Music] look up your redemption is near heaven's powers are shaking and many are mistaking god's meaning to be of the sky god's church is a power that's shaking this hour the day of redemption is the day of redemption
