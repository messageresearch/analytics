[5:41] last week was trying to see how frosted
[5:43] we was going to get frozen over and
[5:45] snowed in and
[5:47] everything else and
[5:50] last week I saw it it was at 32 and
[5:52] today I saw it at 72 so
[5:55] what a difference a week makes
[5:58] we're so thankful Lord has allowed us to
[6:01] be here tonight
[6:04] Lord take care of us and amen I hope
[6:06] we're done with all that
[6:08] cold weather and wet weather and Frozen
[6:10] weather
[6:12] it was a gentleman that worked the other
[6:14] day doing some doing some work for us
[6:17] and
[6:18] he's from Buffalo New York they had five
[6:20] feet of snow up there at the end of last
[6:22] year and he was showing me these
[6:23] pictures
[6:24] I got no desire to be there yeah
[6:28] they say that
[6:30] I had a great uncle always said that the
[6:32] best thing about the north was they had
[6:33] roads leading South
[6:37] that's made for as a whole different
[6:39] group of people that live in that
[6:41] in that part of the world I'm so
[6:44] thankful where we live
[6:46] but I thank the Lord for all his
[6:48] blessings on us and what he's given us
[6:50] and so we uh
[6:53] I want to remember
[6:55] the different ones that are not anyone
[6:57] Bob called me or he sent me a text
[6:59] message saying he was having to work and
[7:01] everything and so it wasn't but he'd be
[7:03] watching in tonight so I know different
[7:05] ones and I'll be able to make it
[7:07] so the Lord be with them and know the
[7:10] different ones that are sick have needs
[7:12] but Lord take care of all that
[7:16] I mean the doctors can only you know
[7:18] doctors can tell you what they can take
[7:19] you but I have a I have a better doctor
[7:24] I have I have one that has a Eternal
[7:27] prescription
[7:28] has an eternal diagnosis so you know
[7:32] they can tell us what's what takes place
[7:34] in this realm but there's another realm
[7:36] that we don't see that's eternal
[7:39] and that's the one we look to
[7:43] so if you have your Bibles we're going

[9:36] we just ask all these things in the name
[9:38] of Jesus Christ
[9:39] amen
[9:41] amen
[9:42] first Peter 4.
[9:46] verse 1 says for as much then as Christ
[9:48] has suffered for us in the flesh arm
[9:51] yourself likewise with the same mind for
[9:53] he that hath suffered In the Flesh has
[9:56] ceased from sin that he no longer should
[9:59] live the rest of his time in the flesh
[10:01] to the lust of men but to the will of
[10:03] God for the time past of our life may
[10:06] suffice us to have wrought the will of
[10:08] the Gentiles when we walked in
[10:10] lasciviousness lust excess of wine
[10:12] revelings banquetings and abominable
[10:15] idolatries wherein they think it's
[10:17] strange that you run not with them to
[10:20] the same excess of riots speaking evil
[10:22] of you who shall give account to him
[10:24] that is ready to judge the quick and the
[10:26] dead
[10:27] for this cause was the Gospel preached
[10:29] also to them that are dead that they
[10:31] might be judged according to men in the
[10:33] flesh but live according to God in the
[10:35] spirit but the end of all things is at
[10:38] hand be ye therefore sober and watch
[10:40] unto prayer
[10:41] and above all things have fervent
[10:43] charity among yourselves for charity
[10:46] shall cover the multitude of sins use
[10:48] Hospitality one to another without
[10:50] grudging
[10:51] as every man hath received the gift even
[10:53] so minister to the same one to another
[10:56] and as good stewards of the manifold
[10:58] grace of God if any man speak let him
[11:01] speak as the Oracles of God if any man
[11:03] Minister let him do it as of the ability
[11:05] which God giveth that God in all things
[11:08] might be glorified through Jesus Christ
[11:10] to whom be praising Dominion forever and
[11:13] ever amen amen amen y'all can be seated
[11:16] Lord bless you bless the reading of the
[11:18] word this evening
[11:20] and they'll just pray for him but not
[11:23] take a little salt
[11:25] speak on the Oracles of God
[11:29] Peter speaks here in in chapter in
[11:32] chapter four
[11:34] just for a little background he says for
[11:37] as much then as Christ has suffered for
[11:39] us in the flesh all yourselves likewise
[11:41] with the same mind for he that hath
[11:43] suffered In the Flesh has ceased from
[11:46] sin
[11:47] and so we understand that Christ
[11:49] suffered for us and that he paid he died
[11:54] and he he paid the sin pavement
[11:58] he paid the price for us he freed us
[12:01] from sin and he said if we have if he
[12:04] has freed us from sin then Peter says
[12:07] for us to arm ourselves with the same
[12:08] knowledge that he that is
[12:11] um
[12:12] he has suffered In the Flesh has ceased
[12:14] from sin that's right that's right so if
[12:16] Jesus as as Hebrews 4 tells us he said
[12:19] that he was tempted at all points as a
[12:22] man yet without sin
[12:24] so he he suffered but he overcame and
[12:29] John 16 he tells them he said you know
[12:31] that in in the war in me you have peace
[12:34] but in the world you have tribulation
[12:36] but he said he said but be of good cheer
[12:39] he said I have overcome the world
[12:42] so if you that if he's overcome the
[12:44] world then you and I are to overcome the
[12:46] world because we are supposed to arm
[12:48] ourselves with the same mind that he
[12:51] suffered as as all things but you know
[12:53] there's nothing that that he because
[12:55] he's our high priest so he can be
[12:57] touched by the feeling of our infirmity
[12:58] so he knows what we've been through and
[13:00] what we go through but you know he
[13:02] overcame and you know what we are able
[13:04] to overcome also why because he's made
[13:06] the way for us and Peter says to arm
[13:08] ourselves with this with this same mind
[13:11] the same mind that was in Christ Jesus
[13:14] and he says for that we no longer should
[13:16] live and the rest of this time in the
[13:19] flesh under the lust of men but to the
[13:21] will of God so when we're down here
[13:23] we're supposed to be living as until
[13:24] unto the will of God what the will of
[13:27] God is in and so we should do that's
[13:29] what our desire should be that we've
[13:31] overcome and we should be doing the will
[13:32] of God and he says for in the time
[13:35] passed you know we've lived as other
[13:37] Gentiles we we've lived in the old life
[13:40] and he said because you know it becomes
[13:43] strange to them that we don't walk in
[13:45] the same way that we used to live or the
[13:47] same ways we used to walk you know a lot
[13:49] of people say you know they say I'm
[13:51] saved I'm saved but you know the thing
[13:53] is is what were they saved from
[13:55] you know because you can't live the same
[13:57] life you used to and act the same way
[13:59] that you used to and say that I'm saved
[14:01] because you know what if if you were
[14:04] drowning and somebody come and pulled
[14:06] you up out of the River or the pond or
[14:08] whatever and they saved you then you
[14:10] would have a change they were to change
[14:12] take place you would be something that
[14:14] would be changed about you you would
[14:16] know there would be something that was
[14:17] drastically different
[14:20] amen
[14:21] and if you and I because you know what
[14:24] we were drowning in sin
[14:26] and you know what they never become a
[14:28] change in us because if you're drowning
[14:30] in sin because as the song said you know
[14:32] I was Sinking Deep in sin far from the
[14:35] peaceful Shore so if I knew where I was
[14:38] and I know where I am today because I
[14:40] know what I've come up out of because I
[14:43] was drowning in sin but I know what God
[14:45] pulled me up out of and so I know where
[14:48] I'm at today and you know you're right
[14:50] they they should see a difference in us
[14:52] because people should look at us and see
[14:55] Jesus Christ they should see there's a
[14:57] difference we shouldn't walk like
[14:58] everybody else you know let's try to be
[15:00] religious I don't want to be religious
[15:01] the world is full of religion
[15:04] but I want to see the life of God I want
[15:07] I want people to know as they were in
[15:08] any other than when they saw those
[15:10] people they said they're just like
[15:11] Christ well if they can't see Christ in
[15:13] us then we need to go back to the Altar
[15:15] and get a hold of something that's real
[15:21] so that going on here and and Paul tells
[15:24] us how we ought to live or I'm sorry
[15:26] Peterson tells us how do we ought to
[15:28] live you know because he says the end of
[15:30] all things is a hand he said be there
[15:32] for sober and unto prayer well because
[15:35] that's one thing we ought to be looking
[15:36] for is a rapture we should be getting
[15:39] ready to get out of here nothing else
[15:41] should matter you know I see the world
[15:43] and the condition that it's in it makes
[15:45] me happy why because I know that's the
[15:47] condition the world is supposed to be in
[15:49] the prophet told us this place was going
[15:51] to fall apart and it's going to be
[15:53] prepared to be burned over well praise
[15:55] God that's what's happening
[15:59] the money in your pocket ain't no good
[16:00] yeah we have to live down here but it's
[16:02] not worth the paper that is printed on
[16:05] right and one of these days it won't be
[16:07] it won't be have anything won't be any
[16:09] value to us when it's all gone you can't
[16:12] take it with you
[16:16] you know the story is about the man that
[16:19] you know I've told it before about the
[16:21] man you know he wanted he wanted to take
[16:22] some of his riches with him and then
[16:24] when he got to when he got to heaven and
[16:26] and he wanted to take you God allowed
[16:27] him to take something with him and he
[16:29] took his gold and he went up there and
[16:30] Peter went and saw him at the gate and
[16:32] looked at him and said you brought
[16:33] pavement with you
[16:39] see because the things down here we have
[16:41] such a hold on and to have such a hold
[16:43] on us
[16:45] but see the thing is is when it's all
[16:47] gone you know all this stuff is all
[16:49] going to be burned off
[16:51] right you know your your car payments
[16:52] and your cars and all your clothes and
[16:55] all these different things that we worry
[16:56] about and these things you know if we
[16:58] just put these under the blood he said
[17:00] seek ye first the kingdom of God and his
[17:02] righteousness he said that all these
[17:04] things will be added unto you
[17:08] if we put ourselves in the right place
[17:10] then God comes on the scene and he meets
[17:12] our needs he gives us what we have need
[17:14] of
[17:15] the old saying is God never turns us
[17:17] away empty unless we're full of
[17:19] ourselves
[17:22] right and so we need to make sure that
[17:24] we're empty of ourselves that he can
[17:26] come in and fill us
[17:29] but he says
[17:30] continuing
[17:32] he says every man hath received the gift
[17:34] even so Minister the same one to another
[17:36] as good stewards of the manifold grace
[17:39] of God why because each one of us have a
[17:42] gift
[17:43] God God didn't call us and and just to
[17:45] be uh Benchwarmers
[17:49] have you ever have you ever found you
[17:51] ever found a place in the Army and it's
[17:53] called a benchwarmer
[17:56] there ain't there ain't no spot in the
[17:58] army of just people just sitting around
[18:02] if you're a soldier you know what they
[18:04] got a job for you
[18:09] it may be cooking it may be washing
[18:11] dishes but you're doing something
[18:13] they don't they don't just bring you in
[18:15] there just for you to stand around and
[18:16] look pretty
[18:17] there's there's a job that each one of
[18:19] them has so God has given us a gift and
[18:21] he said for each one of us to minister
[18:23] the same because we ought to be faithful
[18:26] in the in the job that God has called us
[18:28] to no matter what it is we ought to have
[18:30] the same faithfulness as anybody
[18:33] we shouldn't say well brother Dale has a
[18:35] bigger gift than or a greater gift than
[18:37] I do but no but we should be every one
[18:39] of us here should have the same
[18:41] dedication the same faithfulness to the
[18:43] gift that God has called us to as our
[18:46] pastor does and if we don't then we say
[18:48] well Lord help me because I need to be
[18:50] more faithful do I need to be more
[18:52] dedicated to what you've called me to
[18:55] I may not be able to do what everybody
[18:57] else can do but I'll be the same
[18:59] faithful right
[19:01] right it's just like when when you're in
[19:03] the Army when somebody or when you're on
[19:05] on the ball team or whatever you know
[19:07] you all got to play together you all got
[19:09] to work together each person has to is
[19:11] an integral part of the piece of the
[19:14] plan so each person has to do their part
[19:16] and if each person doesn't do their part
[19:18] then it collapses
[19:21] you say well I'm just a supply sergeant
[19:24] well you know what if all the guys
[19:25] fighting don't get supplies guess what
[19:27] there ain't no fighting going on
[19:31] maybe God calls us to pray but you know
[19:34] what we need to pray
[19:37] somebody's got to be doing some eating
[19:38] interceding
[19:40] right you know I was listening to
[19:41] brother Branham and he was talking about
[19:42] the meetings that he was talking about
[19:43] the success of his meetings and he was
[19:45] talking about those men they just sat on
[19:47] their faces laid on their faces all
[19:48] those days with them when they were
[19:50] preaching you know he was preaching in
[19:52] his and the healing was going on and
[19:55] those men and they were faithful to what
[19:56] God had laid on their heart to do to
[19:58] just stay before God in prayer and he
[20:01] said that's the success of my Ministry
[20:07] it'd be great
[20:09] but sometimes it's the people behind the
[20:11] scenes That You Don't See right
[20:15] you know we we think about sister media
[20:18] you know brother I'm talking about you
[20:20] know here I hear the angel the Lord
[20:21] comes to comes to brother random and
[20:23] speaks to him and you know he sees all
[20:24] these great things and he sees visions
[20:26] and he has all these things happen to
[20:28] him and he talks us about the
[20:29] Supernatural and you know his sister
[20:31] made and he said you know honor if there
[20:34] was any honor given to my family a ghost
[20:36] to her
[20:38] what she do washed his clothes ironed
[20:41] them she raised the kids
[20:43] he said she kept me from the public
[20:46] right
[20:50] and we say well you know we we put
[20:52] brother Branham up on this pedestal
[20:57] because you know what God called a woman
[20:59] to be with him right
[21:03] you know it we we we think that there's
[21:06] no there's no integral Parts but there
[21:08] is doesn't matter what your how small it
[21:10] is how minute it is it's if God called
[21:13] you to that then you have to be faithful
[21:15] to that and you are departed part
[21:18] there is no there's no there's no big
[21:21] eyes in little you
[21:24] we're all the same
[21:28] God calls us to do one part then we
[21:30] ought to do that
[21:32] he says if any man in verse 11 says if
[21:34] any man speak let him speak as the
[21:36] Oracles of God if any man Minister let
[21:39] him do it as of the ability which God
[21:41] giveth that God in all things might be
[21:43] glorified through Jesus Christ to whom
[21:45] be praised and Dominion forever and ever
[21:48] amen
[21:50] so if we should speak
[21:52] he said we speak as the Oracles of God
[21:55] and we Minister Minister as the gift
[21:57] that God has given us
[21:59] and so we want to speak speak as the
[22:02] oracles and that's one of the things I
[22:04] want to look at tonight
[22:07] it's like what is it
[22:08] what is an oracle what is the Oracle of
[22:10] God
[22:12] and I have some definitions if the
[22:16] brothers will pull this up I don't uh
[22:18] there you go
[22:22] in Oracle
[22:24] so the agency or medium given a Divine
[22:26] communication or revelation
[22:28] it's a shrine or a place at which such
[22:31] responses were given any person or
[22:33] things serving as an agency of divine
[22:36] Communication in an utterance made or
[22:38] received as authoritative extremely wise
[22:41] or infallible yeah
[22:44] so he said we ought to speak as the
[22:46] Oracles of God right now when when you
[22:49] look at this I want to break it down
[22:51] into three different groups out of here
[22:53] that because this is very wordy
[22:57] but I want to break it down into three
[22:58] parts
[23:00] out of this
[23:01] yeah there's a person
[23:06] any person serving as an agency or an
[23:09] Avenue
[23:11] or as a channel right
[23:13] of divine communication exactly
[23:17] the first word that comes to mind is a
[23:19] prophet right
[23:21] right a place
[23:24] or something that's used for divine
[23:26] communication
[23:28] he's an utterance
[23:31] tongues and interpretation right
[23:33] prophecy
[23:38] inspiration of a song
[23:41] anything that God communicates through
[23:46] brother Branham says in the in the
[23:48] message spiritual food and due season
[23:51] this one
[23:52] this first one
[23:55] brother Branham says
[24:01] he says we find out Elijah could say
[24:03] that because the message of the hour in
[24:05] the word of God or the messenger the
[24:07] message and the Word was exactly the
[24:09] same thing the prophet the word the
[24:10] message messenger message and God was
[24:12] the same Jesus said if I do not the
[24:15] works that's written of me don't believe
[24:16] me that's good any man and his message
[24:18] is one
[24:20] he said that's why today that they do
[24:21] not believe in doing the works of God
[24:23] because they do not accept the message
[24:25] of God
[24:28] they don't believe the message
[24:31] so the message and the messenger are one
[24:33] the man in his message are one amen so
[24:37] we want to look at these these three
[24:38] types
[24:40] these three oracles that are in the
[24:42] scripture most of the time when you go
[24:43] to the Old Testament is where you're
[24:45] going to find the word oracles when you
[24:46] go to the Old Testament it gives you one
[24:48] one place
[24:50] and that place is the holy of holies
[24:55] and so one of the ones that I want to
[24:58] look at
[24:58] the place of the Holy Holy of the holy
[25:01] of holies and this is a scripture one of
[25:03] the scriptures that you'll find in the
[25:05] scripture First Kings 6 19 it says and
[25:07] the Oracle he prepared in the house
[25:08] within to set there the Ark of the
[25:10] Covenant of the Lord see you know that's
[25:12] where he's talking about is the holy of
[25:13] holies is where the Ark of the Covenant
[25:15] set so that was the oracle
[25:19] in Exodus 25
[25:23] he says Thou shalt Put The Mercy Seat
[25:26] upon the ark
[25:28] and the Ark shall put
[25:31] and then the ark thou shall put the
[25:33] testimony that I give thee and there
[25:36] will I meet with thee in communion with
[25:37] thee from before the mercy seat from
[25:39] between the two cherubims which are upon
[25:42] the Ark of the testimony of all things
[25:44] which I give thee and commandment unto
[25:46] the children of Israel
[25:49] so when he said The Mercy Seat he said
[25:52] this is where I want to communion with
[25:53] you
[25:54] right as so we're speaking of the Oracle
[25:56] he said this is what I want to communion
[25:58] with you
[25:59] he said I want to communion with you
[26:01] before the word right
[26:05] you're going to have to come before the
[26:07] word
[26:08] that's where that's where the Shekinah
[26:10] Glory come down where the mercy was
[26:12] where The Mercy Seat was and he said
[26:14] this is where I want to meet with you
[26:18] but he said there was a divine a divine
[26:21] order given
[26:23] brother Brown talks about there was a
[26:26] divine order
[26:28] and we can go to the next one brother
[26:30] this is from and it fulfill us
[26:34] all righteousness and brother Brandon's
[26:37] speaking here and he was talking about
[26:39] how there was only one way for a man to
[26:42] go in and that was that he had to be
[26:45] cleaned and set aside right right God
[26:48] called God told Moses how to prepare
[26:52] Aaron to go into the holy of holies
[26:55] he couldn't go in just any way
[26:58] he had to be prepared right and brother
[27:02] Brandon said
[27:04] he said see
[27:07] let's go to 87 there brother scroll back
[27:09] down just a minute
[27:11] I put this one in there because he's I
[27:12] was going to read this scripture and
[27:13] it's already in the message I want to
[27:15] praise the Lord
[27:16] he said I want to read some scripture
[27:17] here to you for a moment Book of Exodus
[27:19] I think it's the 29th verse between that
[27:22] chapter rather
[27:23] begin at the first verse he said and
[27:25] Aaron and his son shall bring Thou shalt
[27:27] bring unto the door of the Tabernacle
[27:29] the congregation and washed them with
[27:31] water and thou shalt take the garments
[27:33] and put Aaron in the coat and the robe
[27:35] and the ephod and the ephod and the
[27:38] breastplate to gird him with the curious
[27:40] curious girdle of the ephod and thou
[27:43] shalt take the minor upon his head and
[27:46] upon the holy upon the holy crown upon
[27:48] the miter and thou shalt take the
[27:50] anointing o and pour it over the head
[27:52] and anoint him
[27:54] he said see Aaron the high priest before
[27:56] he could ever be anointed he had to be
[27:57] washed with water therefore when Jesus
[28:00] before he could be anointed our high
[28:02] priest he was washed with water and then
[28:05] and then not anointing oil port on him
[28:08] to anoint him like Aaron was anointed
[28:10] with oh he was anointed with the Holy
[28:12] Ghost for John bear records seeing the
[28:15] spirit of God descending like a dove and
[28:17] going upon him and the voice saying this
[28:19] is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to
[28:22] dwell in
[28:24] and he continues on and he says well
[28:25] it's a beautiful
[28:27] type of us today as priest of God we
[28:30] must be first baptized
[28:31] confess our sins and be baptized in the
[28:34] name of Jesus Christ washing away our
[28:36] sins and then you shall receive the
[28:38] anointing the gift of the Holy Ghost
[28:41] he said so a manner minister or any
[28:44] believer must first be washed from his
[28:46] sins in the name of Jesus Christ and
[28:47] then Anointed with the Holy Ghost to
[28:49] bring forth a testimony for God
[28:53] so there was a there was a divine order
[28:55] given for them to have access he said
[28:58] come before me but you couldn't come
[29:00] just anyway you had to follow the divine
[29:03] order that God gave them and you know he
[29:05] said it was death if you went in without
[29:07] following the prescription the
[29:09] directions that he gave him
[29:12] and he said you couldn't just come in at
[29:14] any time you wanted to you had to come
[29:16] in at the feast time when when the high
[29:18] priest was to bring the blood in before
[29:21] and sprinkle it on The Mercy Seat so
[29:23] there was a divine order given and he
[29:25] said and then you had to be first Aaron
[29:28] and his sons had to be washed
[29:31] so they had to be first you know first
[29:33] on we say realizing they had to be
[29:35] stripped of everything else everything
[29:37] that belonged to them had to be stripped
[29:39] away
[29:40] so it wasn't it was just Aaron standing
[29:43] there and in the washing took place by
[29:45] the prophet
[29:47] right so the prophet came and washed the
[29:49] high priest and then the the robes and
[29:53] the garments that were made just for
[29:55] this purpose was placed on him
[29:58] but it wasn't put on just in any order
[30:00] there was a divine order on how he was
[30:02] dressed and how everything took place
[30:05] and everything had its order and then
[30:07] when it all came together then after the
[30:10] the ephod and the crown was put on and
[30:13] then he was anointed right
[30:15] and then when the oil was poured upon
[30:18] him then he could approach The Mercy
[30:20] Seat but before that he couldn't and he
[30:23] said you and I are the same way
[30:26] we must be anointed
[30:30] so you just can't approach God anyway
[30:36] right it goes later on will
[30:38] see
[30:39] it become a there was a divine order
[30:42] given
[30:44] and you know brother random speaks of
[30:45] the of the pomegranates and the Bales on
[30:48] you know alone and you know even even
[30:50] the walk that the the high priest had
[30:52] going in to the the holy of holies there
[30:55] was a divine order to that right
[30:59] and so he had he had this everything
[31:01] that he done said holy holy holy unto
[31:04] the Lord so there was a divine order
[31:06] given for everything and you and I have
[31:08] that same divine order
[31:10] so will you come to the house of God you
[31:12] know we just don't approach approach it
[31:14] in any way
[31:16] see there's a reason that God has told
[31:18] us how to approach him even when we come
[31:20] to prayer
[31:22] you know people will say you know it
[31:24] amazes me that people sing that song
[31:26] Sweet Hour of Prayer
[31:29] for a lot of people it's unheard of
[31:32] all right
[31:33] you know some people some people say
[31:34] sweet hour a prayer they ain't got a
[31:36] prayer they ain't got an Hour of Prayer
[31:38] in the whole week pop right now
[31:43] and lay me down to sleep
[31:48] Lord help me don't get run over
[31:51] for y'all that left to go through
[31:52] Atlanta
[31:56] anyway you don't say Lord bless my feet
[31:57] food as I munch all this Stone
[32:01] but your other thing is why what's
[32:02] lacking is is because prayer is not just
[32:05] speaking to God
[32:09] prayer is is communing with God there
[32:12] was a communication that took place
[32:14] because you know when the high priest
[32:16] went into that when he went into the
[32:18] holy of holies he said when he sprinkled
[32:20] the blood there he was looking at the
[32:22] Shekinah Glory he was wanting to see
[32:24] that God accepted his his offering right
[32:29] he was deathly sincere because if God
[32:31] did not accept him and accept that blood
[32:34] then he was dead
[32:37] right so it was a death a deathly
[32:39] sincere walking and and going before him
[32:45] and sometimes you know we don't have
[32:47] that sincerity you know if we went in
[32:50] there then Lord you answer back to me I
[32:53] can speak to you but are you going to
[32:54] speak to me
[32:56] yeah
[32:59] one of the other things is
[33:01] speaking of the other the other thing
[33:03] that when you when you speak of an item
[33:05] or a thing or a place rather that you
[33:08] would uh see in the scripture is the is
[33:11] the urum and thumb
[33:14] you know it was the breastplate you know
[33:16] brother Brian said it was on a post it
[33:18] was on a temple in the in the uh on a
[33:21] post in the temple and you know and when
[33:24] the dreamers went before that and
[33:26] brother Branham says in uh
[33:29] and Christ Christ is same yesterday day
[33:31] and forever
[33:33] this is from 1956 and he says
[33:36] he says but now in the Old Testament
[33:38] there were three ways of knowing a
[33:39] message the first was the law the second
[33:41] was the prophet the third was a dreamer
[33:43] then they had a way of proving that
[33:45] whether it was exactly right or not
[33:49] and then he was talking about the he
[33:52] said in the air Nick or the levitical
[33:53] priesthood on Aaron's breastplate had 12
[33:55] Stones and that's it and it's not
[33:57] exactly known by the scholars whether it
[34:00] was a reflection of The Twelve Stones
[34:01] together or a certain sacred light that
[34:04] when a prophet prophesied or a dreamer
[34:05] told his dream whatever it was and these
[34:07] Supernatural lights didn't flash on that
[34:09] that was called the armam thumb and then
[34:11] when the supernatural didn't flash to
[34:13] give witness to that well then it was
[34:15] wrong no matter how true the prophet was
[34:18] how real the dreamer was or whatever the
[34:20] Revelation was it had to be witnessed by
[34:23] the urham thumb if it wasn't it wasn't
[34:25] true
[34:28] he said but in this new priesthood the
[34:31] Bible is God's urham thumb and he said
[34:33] if a revelation comes a prophet
[34:35] prophesies a church is established a
[34:37] Doctrine is made and it don't flash on
[34:39] the Bible that it's wrong this is God's
[34:41] Urban it must be we must listen to the
[34:44] word right
[34:46] right and continuing on this is in the
[34:48] infallibility of the infallible uh word
[34:51] of God 1956 and brother Graham said God
[34:54] is under times and divers manner spoke
[34:55] to the prophets and to the children of
[34:57] the the children by the prophets but in
[35:00] this last day he spoke to us through his
[35:02] son Jesus Christ and this Bible is God's
[35:04] urham thumb and if a prophet prophesies
[35:06] a preacher preaches or if a dreamer
[35:08] dreams a dream or something that is not
[35:10] is done that don't flash on that Bible I
[35:13] just don't go for it that's all
[35:18] now when brother Brown was speaking of
[35:21] this
[35:22] when he's speaking of the urham thumb
[35:24] when they went before the urham thumb
[35:26] and they told their dream
[35:28] you know they didn't go in there and it
[35:30] wasn't some Ouija board that they went
[35:31] in front of
[35:33] you you know when they went before they
[35:35] went and you know people think well you
[35:37] know they just walked in there and the
[35:38] dreamer told his dream and all of a
[35:39] sudden boom there was a light but you
[35:41] know that was not the way it was when
[35:43] they went before that you know they
[35:44] sought God for an answer they looked for
[35:47] a supernatural happening a supernatural
[35:49] light in front of them they just didn't
[35:51] go in and say hey God there it is no
[35:53] they had to go stand in front of the arm
[35:55] thumb and they had to stand there and
[35:58] give their dream and they waited for God
[36:00] to give an answer right
[36:03] see people think well you know Lord you
[36:05] know even brother Branham talked about
[36:06] that you know when he was really
[36:08] heartbroken after after a sister hoping
[36:10] all of them passed away you know and he
[36:12] said you know I don't believe this being
[36:13] using this as a Luigi board but you know
[36:15] God spoke through him through that but
[36:17] you know there's no way it is when we
[36:19] open the scripture we lay in the
[36:21] scripture you lay in the word you just
[36:23] don't jump in there and you know Lord
[36:25] I'm gonna find what I need is
[36:28] there it is
[36:29] no sometimes you lay in the scripture
[36:31] you lay in the word you as Mary did you
[36:34] know she pondered these things in her
[36:36] heart because she had the word and she
[36:38] held it there until it was quick and to
[36:40] her because you know you have to stay in
[36:42] the word and lay in the word and people
[36:44] just think you know I'm just looking for
[36:46] a quick answer well that wasn't the way
[36:47] it was that's the way not the way God
[36:49] does it right
[36:54] so they had to stand there
[36:57] they say they had to be sincere when
[36:58] they went before there
[37:00] and they had to wait they would say that
[37:02] was a divine order given how they
[37:04] handled that
[37:08] so they had to be deathly deathly
[37:11] sincere when they went there and waited
[37:12] for God to give an answer to him that he
[37:15] would answer but if it's true they would
[37:17] answer
[37:18] he would give an answer to it and he
[37:20] said it didn't matter how real it was
[37:23] or or what took place or whoever it was
[37:26] whatever they spoke if it did not flash
[37:28] with the word then that Supernatural
[37:30] light didn't take right and there wasn't
[37:33] no Supernatural happening no light that
[37:35] flashed on it
[37:37] and many people have taken the word and
[37:39] they've had so many doctrines and so
[37:43] many ideas but you know what there's
[37:45] only one thing that can that you can
[37:46] bring through this Bible from Genesis to
[37:49] Revelation and that's a true revelation
[37:51] of God you know you're not going to get
[37:53] anything else as brother Adam said you
[37:55] can't get nothing else to the thinking
[37:56] man's filter because there's only one
[37:58] thing that's going to come through that
[37:59] and that's the word of God
[38:06] so we have to stay before God
[38:11] because you know I've held things many
[38:14] for many years in my life I had
[38:16] questions
[38:20] but you know I know God would give an
[38:21] answer
[38:24] don't know when it would take place
[38:27] but I held it before God
[38:30] and I got my answer
[38:34] you know for many years
[38:37] our heard people preach on the River
[38:39] Jordan
[38:42] and I've told this before
[38:45] you know our our dad and other other
[38:48] people said the same thing you know you
[38:50] hear that the first time sometimes you
[38:52] don't even know why
[38:54] but something just it just something
[38:55] hits you yeah
[38:58] yeah it is just like down inside of you
[39:01] and it's like I remember I remember the
[39:03] first time I ever heard somebody preach
[39:05] on that and I said Lord if that's the
[39:06] truth you'll have to show me that
[39:07] because I don't understand it
[39:11] I held that for a long time
[39:15] and understanding understanding
[39:17] how we how we come here with a seed in
[39:19] US
[39:22] I still remember I don't know if brother
[39:24] Dale remembers or not but we were
[39:25] sitting in his cough at his uh
[39:28] dining room table
[39:30] drinking coffee one morning
[39:33] I don't know if you remember that or not
[39:35] I was sitting there and he was the first
[39:37] time anybody broke that down and started
[39:40] showing me about receiving the word
[39:43] being the seed that's quickened to say I
[39:46] never heard anybody preach on the seed
[39:48] of predest uh seed of representation of
[39:51] predestination
[39:53] I'd never heard anybody speak on that
[39:55] before
[39:56] but you know what as soon as I heard
[39:58] something clicked inside of me and you
[40:00] know I could see things that brother
[40:01] Branham said made sense
[40:04] because people take things and you say
[40:06] well you know which see what seed is
[40:08] being quickened the seed that you came
[40:10] here with or the word that you heard
[40:14] you had to receive the word
[40:19] so if you don't receive if you don't
[40:21] receive the word
[40:23] as even the scripture talks about your
[40:25] brother speaking of you know when Peter
[40:27] preached her when Paul preached to the
[40:28] people when when they heard the word
[40:31] then when that took place then the Holy
[40:34] Ghost came and quickened the word to
[40:35] them right
[40:39] hold on
[40:42] I'm the air man
[40:45] is that on
[40:47] whoo
[40:54] we received a time out here
[40:57] maybe that'll help y'all everybody
[40:59] Fanning
[41:02] I'll run
[41:04] that won't happen everywhere
[41:11] um I'll have to get to that part of the
[41:13] message later where
[41:15] you know God changes changed his mask
[41:17] and he went from one to the other so I
[41:19] had to step I had to go into the other
[41:20] office of being the AC man right
[41:26] God knows all things
[41:29] but you know we stand here and so we go
[41:32] before God and sincerity
[41:35] and God gives us our answer right
[41:38] and you know when you when you say you
[41:40] what what how you how you came into into
[41:43] being
[41:44] just like just like that story about the
[41:46] little Eagle you know when something
[41:47] Rings true you know that's what you're
[41:50] always you've always been looking for
[41:52] the scripture says when when the Deep
[41:54] call it to the Deep
[41:56] see when there when there's a deep
[41:58] calling there's a deep to respond to
[42:00] that well because there's something that
[42:02] you're looking for and when you find it
[42:04] then you'll say that's what I've always
[42:05] been looking for and it's like thank God
[42:08] because there's something that fills me
[42:10] now well because there's a void there
[42:12] until that time and you're looking for
[42:14] something and when that void and then
[42:15] there's something that fits right
[42:16] perfectly and you say thank God that's
[42:18] what I've been looking for right
[42:20] sometimes you know brother random said
[42:21] in the message thirst he said the man
[42:23] was had a thirst inside him God put that
[42:25] thirst in him for God and he tries to
[42:27] fill it with everything else Under the
[42:29] Sun and they're looking for it and
[42:31] people have tried to dig and probe into
[42:32] the message and tried to come up with
[42:34] their own ideas but you know what they
[42:36] need to do is get before God and let him
[42:38] come and bring the word to him because
[42:40] that's what they're looking for but you
[42:42] know what they start running without a
[42:43] message
[42:44] yeah
[42:47] I just I just want to be you know I tell
[42:49] everybody you know that I'm just like a
[42:52] spare tire the Reason God made me look
[42:54] like the Michelin Man but that's all I
[42:56] want to be
[43:02] whatever whatever you know whatever
[43:04] little part that I've got that's what I
[43:05] want to be
[43:09] all right I don't you know because a lot
[43:10] of people you know they have it in their
[43:12] mind they have to be the best you know
[43:13] they want to be the top dog or you know
[43:15] the highest one everybody looks up to
[43:19] I don't want that
[43:22] yeah I don't have I don't have enough
[43:26] God didn't make me that way
[43:30] thank the Lord
[43:34] you know everybody gets worried about
[43:35] somebody else doing doing better I hope
[43:37] people do better than me
[43:40] I hope you know the Lord gives
[43:44] opens his word to a lot of people
[43:46] it's a lot more more than me Lord just
[43:49] open up the windows of heaven and pour
[43:51] it out on them
[43:55] right I don't want you know I don't want
[43:57] to ever get to the point where I feel
[43:58] like you know
[44:01] that that I'm
[44:03] uh envious of anybody because of what
[44:06] they have
[44:09] because he said he'd opened he's the
[44:11] only Divine revealer of the word and
[44:13] he'll give you the portion that you have
[44:15] need of
[44:23] now this the other one here will be
[44:26] going to
[44:28] is uh the other Oracle
[44:32] is a person a prophet a person within an
[44:36] infallible Authority or Commission
[44:39] one that God works through
[44:41] brother Brahm says here in in the
[44:43] message of seventh seal
[44:46] he said if there's a whole bunch of
[44:48] trumpets laying here and one of them had
[44:50] to sound out a certain music if the man
[44:52] them trumpets
[44:53] are perfectly mute
[44:56] it's the fella that can sound the
[44:57] trumpet that knows what he's going to do
[45:00] that picks up a trumpet the trumpet has
[45:03] nothing to do with it the sound comes
[45:05] from the intelligence behind it that's
[45:07] right so all trumpets are the same all
[45:10] men are the same
[45:12] all Christians are the same amen
[45:15] so we're perfectly mute
[45:18] when God calls us it's not what we do
[45:20] it's not what we can do it's what he
[45:23] does
[45:24] hey brain what he brings through us
[45:31] and so
[45:32] we're gonna
[45:34] continue here
[45:37] going to do a little
[45:38] go do a little reading here
[45:41] but you know you look at people in the
[45:44] scripture and this is this is one person
[45:45] that that really stood out to me
[45:48] without doing it I was doing some
[45:50] reading and
[45:52] it was it was the it's the prophet
[45:55] Michaela
[45:57] and the scripture says
[46:00] and all the prophets prophesied so
[46:02] saying go up to Ramos Gilead and prosper
[46:05] for the Lord shall delivered into the
[46:07] king's hand
[46:09] and he said in the messenger that was
[46:10] gone to call Michaela spake unto him
[46:12] saying behold now the words of the
[46:15] prophets declare good unto the king with
[46:18] one mouth
[46:20] let Thy word I pray thee be like the
[46:23] word of them of one of them and speak
[46:26] that which is good
[46:29] and Michaela said as the Lord liveth
[46:31] what the Lord saith unto me that will I
[46:34] speak
[46:35] so he came unto the king and the King
[46:37] said unto him Michaela shall we go up go
[46:41] against Ramos Gilead or battle or shall
[46:44] we forbear and he answered him go and
[46:47] prosper for the Lord shall deliver it
[46:49] into the hand of the king and the King
[46:51] said unto him how many times shall I
[46:54] adjour Thee that thou shalt tell me
[46:56] nothing that which is true in the name
[46:59] of the Lord
[47:01] and he said I saw all Israel scattered
[47:03] under the hills of sheep that had no
[47:05] Shepherd and the Lord said these have no
[47:08] master let them return every man to his
[47:11] house in peace
[47:12] and the king of Israel said unto
[47:14] Jehoshaphat
[47:15] did I not tell thee that he would
[47:18] Prosper he would prophesy no good
[47:20] concerning me but evil and he said hear
[47:23] thou therefore the word of the Lord I
[47:25] Saw the Lord standing sitting on his
[47:27] throne and all the hosts of Heaven is
[47:29] standing by him on his left right hand
[47:31] and on his left and the Lord said who
[47:33] shall persuade Ahab that he may go up
[47:36] and fall at Raymond Gilead and and one
[47:39] said on this manner and another said on
[47:42] that manner and there came forth a
[47:44] spirit and stood before the Lord and
[47:46] said I will persuade him and the Lord
[47:49] said unto him wherewith and he said I
[47:51] will go forth and I will be a lying
[47:53] spirit in the mouth of All His prophets
[47:55] and he said Thou shalt persuade him and
[47:58] Prevail also go forth and do so now
[48:01] therefore behold the the Lord hath put a
[48:04] lying spirit in the mouth of all thy
[48:05] prophets and the Lord has spoken evil
[48:07] concerning thee but zedekiah the son of
[48:10] China
[48:13] went in there and smoked Michaela on the
[48:15] cheek and said which way went the spirit
[48:16] of the Lord from me to speak unto thee
[48:19] and Michaela said behold Thou shalt see
[48:21] in that day when thou shalt go into and
[48:24] enter enter chamber to hide thyself and
[48:26] the king of Israel said take Makia and
[48:29] carry him back unto Amon the governor of
[48:32] the city under the Jewish the King's son
[48:36] and say thus saith the king put this
[48:38] fella in the prison and feed him with
[48:40] bread of Affliction and with water
[48:41] Affliction till I come and Michaela said
[48:44] if Thou shalt if thou return at all in
[48:47] peace the Lord have not spoken to me and
[48:50] he said hearken old people every one of
[48:52] you
[48:53] I know there's a lengthy reading but but
[48:55] you know I I it really stands out to me
[48:57] a number of things that In this passage
[48:59] and you know when when the children of
[49:02] Israel when when God told Abraham Moses
[49:05] in the book of Deuteronomy when when
[49:08] Moses
[49:09] was told that he was not going into the
[49:11] promised land but he gave the words to
[49:14] the children of Israel before they went
[49:16] in
[49:16] and he prophesied to him and told him
[49:18] about the land that God had brought him
[49:20] to the place to carry him into the land
[49:22] and he said I'm you know I'm not going
[49:24] in but I've seen the land but he said
[49:26] God has promised y'all that land you're
[49:28] going to go in and possess it but he
[49:30] said you must hearken to the word of the
[49:32] Lord and you must stay there and you
[49:35] must follow it you must follow them and
[49:37] you must drive the inhabitants out
[49:39] because if you'd only drive them out see
[49:42] there'll be a problem unto you they will
[49:44] be Authority in your flesh for the rest
[49:46] of your life and and and God tells Moses
[49:49] later on he said these people he said
[49:52] when they go into that land he said
[49:54] they'll possess it he said but then
[49:56] they'll waxing fat and they'll get lazy
[49:58] and he said and then and then they'll
[50:00] turn away from me and break my Covenant
[50:02] he told Moses before he died what they
[50:05] were going to do when they went into
[50:06] that land and that they would not
[50:08] receive the word and you know what those
[50:10] people would be upon them as as a weight
[50:13] and a chain and a problem all of their
[50:16] lives yeah
[50:17] why because they wouldn't go in and they
[50:19] wouldn't destroy every single one of
[50:21] them
[50:26] so when God told him what was going to
[50:28] take place here here was that the word
[50:29] was given to them
[50:31] and they didn't go in
[50:35] and then we see how you go through the
[50:37] Kings and you know
[50:39] the children of Israel told Samuel that
[50:42] they wanted a king and he said you don't
[50:43] need a king but we want to be like
[50:45] everybody else we want to be like
[50:47] everybody else we want our King to rule
[50:49] over us and Samuel said have I not told
[50:51] you the word of the Lord that my entire
[50:53] life what have I done against you
[50:55] nothing
[50:56] you've been just what the word what
[50:57] you've done what the what the prophet
[50:59] that you were supposed to be you've been
[51:02] a blessing to us but we want to be like
[51:03] them
[51:05] he said you know what he's going to take
[51:07] your children from you he's going to
[51:09] take the best that you have and make it
[51:11] his
[51:13] yeah that's okay we want to be like
[51:15] everybody else
[51:18] the next thing you know they've got Saul
[51:21] and then they had David and Ed Solomon
[51:25] but then all of a sudden after that they
[51:27] start having all of the other ones you
[51:29] know Solomon was the was the great one
[51:31] but you know when he got old he got away
[51:34] from God because he looked because the
[51:36] scripture said he loves strange women
[51:37] and because he had had all these women
[51:40] he had a lot of children that didn't
[51:42] follow God he didn't instruct his
[51:44] children in the way that was true and
[51:46] what happened was his children came
[51:48] along and they took the throne and they
[51:50] built altars to Baal and they had Groves
[51:53] that they could that they could burn
[51:55] incense and all these things to all
[51:57] kinds of other gods and they didn't
[51:58] follow the word
[52:01] and what happened after that
[52:04] the next king was worse than the one
[52:06] before him the scripture says in the
[52:08] next one was worse than him before him
[52:10] and every time that they had one that
[52:11] was halfway decent they tried to follow
[52:13] the word and you have Josiah and the
[52:15] different ones that tried to raise up
[52:17] but you know there was only once but the
[52:19] scripture tells us every time one rose
[52:21] up they tried to follow the god it says
[52:24] but yet they never cut down the Grove
[52:29] see he tried to walk in the way that God
[52:32] had prepared
[52:34] of his fathers but the problem was he
[52:37] could never destroy what was around the
[52:40] people he might have tried to build it
[52:42] up but you know what that Grove was
[52:44] still there as a testament to the false
[52:47] gods and they still stood there and they
[52:49] still burned their incense and still
[52:51] altered their sacrifices and had their
[52:54] children walk through the coals not fire
[52:59] well they'd gotten away from it but you
[53:01] know what they still wanted to be called
[53:03] by his name they still wanted to have
[53:05] the blessings that God got bestowed upon
[53:08] Solomon
[53:11] and then when they come to this point
[53:15] you know Ahab comes along
[53:18] and you know here's here's a son Ahab
[53:21] and you know he sees that Ramos Gilead
[53:25] you know ramach Gillette was one of the
[53:27] cities that was given to him that was a
[53:29] uh one of the Cities of Refuge that God
[53:31] had put where the where the Slayer had
[53:34] innocently killed somebody that they
[53:35] could run to
[53:37] and it was a place that was given and
[53:39] Ahab said you know Ramos belongs to us
[53:41] we ought to go up and take it and he's
[53:44] asking about Jehoshaphat will you raise
[53:45] up with us and let's go take this from
[53:47] the syrians
[53:49] well you know what they wouldn't be in
[53:51] that mess in the first place if they'd
[53:52] followed the word
[53:55] but you know here it was they got messed
[53:57] up in all of this and they were wanting
[53:59] to go back
[54:02] and Jehoshaphat had no business being
[54:04] with him
[54:06] Eliot Elijah had already cursed Ahab
[54:08] because of taking naboth's Garden
[54:12] he'd already put put a curse on him and
[54:14] he said well can we find somebody that
[54:16] can prophesy we've got 400 saying take
[54:19] it it's ours
[54:21] president said they were all
[54:23] fundamentally right
[54:26] but he said Abraham wasn't right himself
[54:30] and I'll say oh yeah we can take that oh
[54:32] yeah we can do that God has given us us
[54:34] this land
[54:35] it's all of ours it's been ours
[54:39] but you can't walk away from God and and
[54:42] turn your back on what God has called
[54:44] you to do and expect you're going to
[54:45] claim the blessings of God
[54:49] and he said Michaela I want you to know
[54:54] you know he had one of them come up
[54:55] there and say Makanda we want you to say
[54:57] what all these other 400 are saying
[55:00] you better say this
[55:04] if you know what's good for you we got a
[55:07] lot of things we can bestow upon you if
[55:08] you can just say what the 400 say
[55:12] yeah and Michaela says I'm not going to
[55:14] say anything but what God tells me to
[55:15] speak
[55:17] but you know when he walks up there and
[55:18] Ahab will ask him and Jehoshaphat ask
[55:20] him say what does the Lord say what do
[55:22] you say Michaela he said go up
[55:26] go up and prosper the Lord's told you go
[55:29] ahead
[55:31] no wonder but I have gotten mad at him
[55:33] yeah
[55:35] he said how many times am I going to
[55:37] enjoy you to speak what God tells you to
[55:39] speak
[55:42] but see ahabit already made up his mind
[55:44] it didn't matter what what Michaela told
[55:46] him he was going to do whatever he
[55:47] wanted to right right
[55:50] and that's when he went up there and he
[55:51] told him he said look he said God they
[55:54] come and was speaking to God and he let
[55:56] a lying Spirit come to that 400 prophets
[55:59] and tell you what you wanted to hear
[56:02] and it's going to be your death
[56:07] and they didn't they didn't appreciate
[56:08] it
[56:09] but it was the truth
[56:12] many times people people they were they
[56:14] just want to go find somebody to tell
[56:15] them what they want to hear
[56:20] how does had a situation many years ago
[56:23] a young man was a young preacher and
[56:25] this and this lady had had something
[56:26] going on and
[56:28] she come to ask the pastor a question
[56:35] of a personal
[56:38] situation going on and he told her
[56:42] go ahead
[56:44] blew that preacher's mind
[56:46] that young preachers
[56:48] what I can't believe the Pastor said
[56:50] someone asked the pastor later
[56:54] he said brother that's what gets the
[56:55] prophet's message how could you tell her
[56:57] that I said brother she's been around
[57:00] all kind of different preachers asking
[57:01] about that same question everybody keeps
[57:03] telling her the same answer she's trying
[57:05] to find somebody to tell her he said it
[57:07] don't matter what I tell her she's going
[57:08] to go ahead and do what she wants to
[57:12] it and he said I just told her go ahead
[57:14] I didn't tell her it was right I just
[57:15] told her to go ahead because that's what
[57:17] she's going to do anyway
[57:20] and that's what Michaela told him listen
[57:22] you ain't gonna listen to me you got
[57:24] these 400 you got what you wanted you
[57:25] got your cheering section over here
[57:27] they're telling you go ahead so that's
[57:28] all you're going to do why are you
[57:30] asking my opinion
[57:33] people want people they got to justify
[57:35] everything that they do
[57:38] they gonna prop it up you know none of
[57:40] that's going to stand but that's what
[57:42] people do I want to be right with the
[57:44] word
[57:47] right so you know he told him he said
[57:48] listen
[57:49] he said go on up
[57:51] but he said I seen him scattered like
[57:54] sheep without a shepherd
[57:56] that you're going to die Ahab
[57:58] it's death but go ahead do what you want
[58:01] to you're not going to listen to me
[58:04] and you know they got mad at
[58:06] McKay and they put him in and took
[58:09] prison and you know said feed him the
[58:10] water reflection to the bread of
[58:12] Affliction until I return
[58:13] he said if you return it all God never
[58:15] spoke to me right
[58:18] right it was death but you know what
[58:19] they didn't listen but people are that
[58:21] way you can tell them what they what you
[58:23] want what you know because they're going
[58:24] to find somebody that's going to tickle
[58:26] their ears
[58:28] but that's not what God has called them
[58:31] what's called them too
[58:34] to receive that
[58:37] God has called us to receive the word
[58:41] whatever the word
[58:43] whatever the word does to us
[58:49] continuing on
[58:53] brother Adam
[58:55] speaking here
[58:57] and then another one
[59:00] you see a man
[59:03] as as McKay you know come and speak the
[59:05] word of God
[59:07] in a
[59:10] uh everybody against you but you know he
[59:12] stood there and said what what God laid
[59:14] on his heart to say and done what God
[59:16] wanted him to do
[59:19] and you know you look at ones that come
[59:21] and you know Michaela said all those
[59:24] Prophets
[59:25] they spoke of Christ they manifested
[59:27] Christ that was Christ being made
[59:29] manifest and you know we look at the
[59:32] Life of Christ and and you know brother
[59:34] Brandon was talking of of Christ you
[59:36] know he said
[59:38] here in uh
[59:41] we're gonna jump around here a little
[59:42] bit Saint John 5 19 he said then Jesus
[59:46] answered and said on there he said
[59:47] verily Mary I say unto you the son can
[59:49] do nothing of himself but what he seeth
[59:51] the father do for what things soever he
[59:53] doeth these also doeth the son likewise
[59:57] so he could only he could only do
[1:00:00] what God had called him to do he said
[1:00:02] for the father of the son and showing
[1:00:04] him all these things that himself doeth
[1:00:07] and he will show him Greater Works than
[1:00:10] these
[1:00:11] that you may Marvel right
[1:00:13] right God so you know God called
[1:00:18] spoke to Jesus and we know we know it
[1:00:21] was God made manifest in another form
[1:00:24] but you know
[1:00:27] brother Dale was talking about the other
[1:00:29] day and I never did I never did find
[1:00:31] that quote Brethren never never mentions
[1:00:34] in in the message that uh he ever
[1:00:39] he ever sprinkled the human flesh on the
[1:00:41] theophany
[1:00:43] but brother Brandon did say
[1:00:45] this is in faithful Abraham this is this
[1:00:47] is where I where I got this from and
[1:00:50] bring that other faithful Abraham the
[1:00:52] quote up and brother Branham says
[1:00:55] when he's speaking of of Melchizedek
[1:00:58] coming
[1:01:00] he said it was God himself and two
[1:01:01] angels God himself and two angels in
[1:01:04] human form he said I often said someone
[1:01:06] said you don't mean that Bill yes I do I
[1:01:08] sure do God he said what we made of he
[1:01:11] said 16 elements of the Earth
[1:01:14] Cosmic light and petroleum and potash
[1:01:16] and calcium God just reached over and
[1:01:19] got him a handful of each went
[1:01:22] and stepped right into it said come here
[1:01:25] Gabriel
[1:01:26] puff get in here Michael and going to
[1:01:29] see what what's going on in Sodom Ben a
[1:01:31] lot of prayers coming up here I want to
[1:01:33] see what's going on and he moved out
[1:01:35] there
[1:01:37] and you know when when and the the point
[1:01:40] that what struck me was when brother
[1:01:42] renovus when you listen to brother
[1:01:43] random speaking this and he's speaking
[1:01:45] of of him coming down and he was coming
[1:01:47] to see meet with Abraham and he was
[1:01:50] coming in to step into flesh right you
[1:01:52] know he blew that he blew that 16
[1:01:55] elements
[1:01:56] and when those 16 elements went forth he
[1:01:59] stepped into that
[1:02:01] yeah so when when they you see the when
[1:02:03] I was explaining about the sprinkling it
[1:02:05] was when he went like that then he
[1:02:07] stepped into that and then that human
[1:02:09] those 16 elements took the form
[1:02:13] of that theophany
[1:02:16] because when you go back and watch see
[1:02:18] what the the point that it struck me was
[1:02:20] I was reading and when you look at when
[1:02:22] it talks about Genesis 2 7 it says and
[1:02:24] God formed the Man Out of the Dust to
[1:02:26] the Earth you go back to Genesis is
[1:02:28] where it talks about that Aaron CR he he
[1:02:31] fashioned took a fashion until and he
[1:02:34] fashioned the golden calf and it's the
[1:02:37] same word because when you go back when
[1:02:39] he when they took the earrings well he
[1:02:41] took their earrings and their gold and
[1:02:43] he put it into the fire it had no form
[1:02:46] the goat had no form it was a mass of
[1:02:50] gold there and he went in and he formed
[1:02:52] that to make that calf so it took on the
[1:02:56] Creator was Aaron he took the toll and
[1:03:00] he formed that goal to look like he
[1:03:02] wanted he wanted it to so when when when
[1:03:05] Genesis 2 7 when the flesh came he took
[1:03:08] on the form that God had in his mind
[1:03:10] which was that theophany so when when
[1:03:13] brother Branham step you know speaking
[1:03:15] of him stepping out there that he stood
[1:03:17] there and he spoke to Abraham and he ate
[1:03:19] that calf and he ministered to him and
[1:03:22] then when he went to went to Paradise
[1:03:24] when when he was in paradise and Abraham
[1:03:26] saw Jesus there he said that's the one
[1:03:29] we fed the calf to why because he took
[1:03:32] on that form he said we no longer see
[1:03:34] Melchizedek because he became Jesus
[1:03:37] Christ
[1:03:41] so that form was there
[1:03:45] so when when the logos came forth it
[1:03:49] wasn't it wasn't some part
[1:03:54] you know like like it was like something
[1:03:55] was lost
[1:03:58] it was just another manifestation of
[1:04:00] himself
[1:04:02] so when you when he came forth it wasn't
[1:04:05] that he that you know he he was
[1:04:08] different
[1:04:10] he was manifesting himself that he would
[1:04:13] that that he could be seen in a greater
[1:04:15] Realm
[1:04:17] see people people sometimes they they
[1:04:19] try to make this thing like it like he's
[1:04:21] trying to uh confuse people no he
[1:04:25] stepped forth to make himself known
[1:04:30] and people people
[1:04:32] get confused I don't I don't know but I
[1:04:35] see that more that when when you can't
[1:04:38] you can't eliminate God you can't
[1:04:40] decrease God
[1:04:43] something that's infinite that has that
[1:04:45] has no bounds and yet it has a form that
[1:04:49] looks like you and I
[1:04:52] so when he stood there and he said he
[1:04:54] said A Part went out from him well if
[1:04:56] he's infinite
[1:04:58] he's Limitless it don't matter how many
[1:05:00] times he expanded or went out it didn't
[1:05:03] change who he was
[1:05:06] so when all God was he poured into
[1:05:08] Christ
[1:05:09] he didn't he didn't do away with God
[1:05:11] right right the father's still there
[1:05:15] so when the son came forth the logos it
[1:05:17] didn't change who he was
[1:05:23] because when you take something that's
[1:05:24] infinite
[1:05:27] because of what and when you when you
[1:05:29] look at something that has no bounds it
[1:05:30] has no ends you can't you know like I
[1:05:33] always say you know if you take infinity
[1:05:35] and you cut it in half what do you have
[1:05:38] you still got Infinity
[1:05:43] you can't you can't say well you know
[1:05:45] this is this is this is the left
[1:05:47] Infinity that's the right Infinity
[1:05:49] no it's still Infinity right
[1:05:54] you know most people of mine you know
[1:05:56] you look we say well how many numbers
[1:05:57] fall between one and two I've asked this
[1:06:00] question many times and I'm gonna ask it
[1:06:01] again and I know I confuse some people
[1:06:03] but uh hopefully I'll keep saying it to
[1:06:05] you I'll figure it out the Lord will
[1:06:06] show it to you rather
[1:06:09] any more how many numbers fall between
[1:06:10] one and two
[1:06:13] they say there's no numbers between one
[1:06:14] and two
[1:06:17] so one and a half is not a number
[1:06:20] one and three quarters is not a number
[1:06:22] one
[1:06:23] one in one thousandths not a number
[1:06:26] one in one fifty thousands is not a
[1:06:28] number
[1:06:29] one in one Mega that's not a number
[1:06:31] so let's keep going how many numbers can
[1:06:33] you put between one and two yeah
[1:06:36] there's an infinite set of numbers in
[1:06:38] between one and two
[1:06:40] I can divide I can divide one into give
[1:06:43] me some you know one you can divide as
[1:06:46] many times you want to
[1:06:49] I can just sit there and keep dividing
[1:06:51] dividing you give me any number I can
[1:06:52] divide it in half
[1:06:54] it just keeps on dividing
[1:06:58] so we say well we have a portion of him
[1:07:05] but if you've got a part of him then
[1:07:07] guess what you're infinite too
[1:07:09] right because if he's Eternal and you
[1:07:12] and he's giving you a person a part of
[1:07:13] that eternal life that eternity and
[1:07:16] that's what makes you it makes you
[1:07:18] Eternal it doesn't matter how small that
[1:07:20] part is if it's a part of God that
[1:07:22] you've received then guess what it's
[1:07:24] eternal
[1:07:26] you can't you can't diminish it because
[1:07:29] he didn't become diminished because he
[1:07:31] gave us something because he made itself
[1:07:33] known
[1:07:35] but it was when in the beginning all
[1:07:37] that he was back there he is today
[1:07:40] all that God was he poured into Christ
[1:07:44] well he didn't lose nobody right
[1:07:47] right so they didn't disappear
[1:07:50] all that Christ was he poured into the
[1:07:52] church
[1:07:56] see some some of these one of these days
[1:07:58] I know right dad's going to get to it
[1:07:59] one of these days we're going to see who
[1:08:00] we are right
[1:08:03] right because if brother Branham said
[1:08:05] all that God was he poured into Christ
[1:08:07] and all that Christ was he poured into
[1:08:09] the believer right
[1:08:13] when we see who we are then we're
[1:08:16] exactly who he is
[1:08:19] right we've not we've not diminished
[1:08:22] right see sometimes the only the only
[1:08:24] limit that we really have in in in who
[1:08:27] we are through Christ is the limit so we
[1:08:29] put on ourselves
[1:08:31] that's that's the limit that we have
[1:08:34] because we say well there's a part
[1:08:36] there's you know that peace we we
[1:08:38] received our portion we've received the
[1:08:40] seed you know all these we try to look
[1:08:42] at it almost like it's minute or some
[1:08:45] kind of little piece yeah
[1:08:48] and we understand the little peace the
[1:08:50] part that we receive it's more than
[1:08:51] enough
[1:08:54] but sometimes we don't see we we try to
[1:08:55] we try to limit ourselves
[1:08:59] because if you see who and and I I tell
[1:09:03] you I don't I don't see it all but I say
[1:09:04] enough because I when I say that I see
[1:09:07] greater is he that's in me than he
[1:09:10] that's in the world why because I have
[1:09:12] my I have my portion and that's enough
[1:09:16] I know that I know God will reveal more
[1:09:18] to me but in what he started with in the
[1:09:21] beginning is what's going to carry me on
[1:09:23] because I'm just going to be adding to
[1:09:25] that or it's going to become manifest
[1:09:27] it's going to continue to grow
[1:09:32] and you know and sometimes we look at
[1:09:33] words like like growing it's not it's
[1:09:35] not like God is getting bigger because
[1:09:37] if he's infinite then he's not getting
[1:09:39] bigger because he's infinite so he's not
[1:09:41] growing
[1:09:44] but it becomes more real to us we're
[1:09:46] growing in him we see more of him we
[1:09:48] manifest more of him so it's not that
[1:09:51] he's changing we're changing so the
[1:09:53] changing is taking place in us because
[1:09:55] we're becoming more like him
[1:09:59] foreign
[1:10:02] part of what you what you're preaching
[1:10:04] on
[1:10:07] that's what I see anyway
[1:10:10] because I want I see because if God ever
[1:10:13] given me a part of him then that's the
[1:10:15] part that God wanted me to have and
[1:10:16] that's what I'm going to manifest
[1:10:20] and there's more of him revealing
[1:10:22] himself because if you make it to Faith
[1:10:24] then it's this what was that faith is
[1:10:27] continuing
[1:10:30] it's more of him making a new manifest
[1:10:32] in us he's growing in US
[1:10:35] so when we're adding to that we're
[1:10:37] adding
[1:10:38] not not in a not in a physical or you
[1:10:41] know as we think of it we're trying to
[1:10:43] add to but it's that is growing or
[1:10:45] making more manifest
[1:10:51] so when we're adding to that there's
[1:10:54] more of God to be made known to us
[1:10:57] to make us a full stature of Jesus
[1:10:59] Christ
[1:11:02] I thank God because you know a lot of
[1:11:05] people don't see that
[1:11:07] and a lot of people you know I thank God
[1:11:09] for brother Wade and him bringing the
[1:11:11] messages that he did because you know
[1:11:13] there's there's so many things that you
[1:11:15] can that you see and a lot of people you
[1:11:17] know you realize a lot of people have
[1:11:18] never heard that in their entire life
[1:11:22] exactly right A lot of people you know
[1:11:24] the message has has been more has been
[1:11:27] published more and and made more
[1:11:29] available today than it ever has in in
[1:11:31] the entire history of the of the brother
[1:11:34] random's Ministry and you know people
[1:11:35] understand it more at least now than any
[1:11:38] other time
[1:11:39] we got more people confused about what
[1:11:41] he's saying
[1:11:54] and I'm just so thankful that God has
[1:11:57] given us a Ministry to bring us to that
[1:11:59] place because you know we
[1:12:03] we can't all we can't do it ourselves
[1:12:06] right no man's an island
[1:12:08] right and he gave us a five-fold
[1:12:09] Ministry and each each person brings
[1:12:12] their part in and you receive from that
[1:12:14] fivefold Ministry because it's not it's
[1:12:16] not one person it's him
[1:12:22] so when when we receive that word
[1:12:26] we're gonna go to
[1:12:28] skip down to
[1:12:30] brother I'm sending a message the perim
[1:12:31] in church age
[1:12:33] he said now then this word has left
[1:12:36] behind on the printed Pages a part of
[1:12:38] him when you accept it by faith into a
[1:12:40] Spirit-filled life he said his word was
[1:12:43] life
[1:12:45] John 6 63 says
[1:12:48] but that is exactly what is
[1:12:51] John 14 6 says I am the way the truth
[1:12:54] and life Romans 8 9 be says if any man
[1:12:57] have not the spirit of Christ he has
[1:12:58] none of his there it is he is spirit and
[1:13:00] his life that is exactly what the word
[1:13:02] is that is exactly what Jesus is he is
[1:13:04] the word so when a spirit-born
[1:13:06] Spirit-filled man in faith takes the
[1:13:08] word into his heart and places upon his
[1:13:10] lips why that is the same as deity
[1:13:12] speaking every man has to go Satan
[1:13:15] cannot stand before that man
[1:13:18] amen
[1:13:21] so we've received that
[1:13:23] if we received the word and he said and
[1:13:26] he says if we speak the word
[1:13:29] a Spirit-filled child of God speaks a
[1:13:32] word he said it's the same as him
[1:13:34] speaking
[1:13:41] he said it's deity speaking why because
[1:13:43] it's it's not us speaking but it's him
[1:13:45] if we speak the word he said if if you
[1:13:48] say unto this mountain
[1:13:52] because if it's the father speaking
[1:13:54] through you then it'll take place
[1:13:57] he said he said ask that your joy might
[1:14:00] be full
[1:14:01] he said he said we do not have he said
[1:14:03] you have not because you ask not
[1:14:07] right because why because you know he
[1:14:08] said you know if we want little things
[1:14:10] then ask God for little things but if
[1:14:12] you want big things then ask God for big
[1:14:13] things
[1:14:18] you know I've got I've got you know my
[1:14:19] boys they don't they don't mind asking
[1:14:21] me for anything
[1:14:24] and I understand as they get older it
[1:14:26] gets worse
[1:14:30] oh it gets better
[1:14:33] more expensive that's what I hear it
[1:14:36] gets more expensive
[1:14:38] but you know they don't mind asking
[1:14:41] and asking and asking and asking when
[1:14:46] they get tired of asking me they'll ask
[1:14:47] their mom you know I ask
[1:14:50] and ask
[1:14:54] The Book of Luke I think it's chapter 11
[1:14:57] there he said you know if if you
[1:15:00] if your son asks for a fish he said well
[1:15:02] you give him a serpent he said if he
[1:15:04] asks for bread would you give him a
[1:15:05] stone
[1:15:07] he said he said if you being evil know
[1:15:10] how to give good gifts to your children
[1:15:12] how much more will your heavenly father
[1:15:15] give unto them that ask him he said he
[1:15:17] said how much more will he give the
[1:15:20] other other scripture says how much more
[1:15:21] will they give of the Holy Ghost to them
[1:15:24] that ask him right
[1:15:28] right so he said ask
[1:15:30] ask and you shall receive
[1:15:34] but you know we say well what we should
[1:15:38] come as as the faith of a child
[1:15:40] well you know they don't mind asking
[1:15:43] right
[1:15:45] you know they can get in trouble and you
[1:15:47] know you're just ready to
[1:15:49] uh
[1:15:51] I always like to say I like
[1:15:56] anyway I want to get a hold of them
[1:16:00] but you know what they don't mind they
[1:16:02] get you can get you know they just get
[1:16:03] under your skin you just like
[1:16:06] I know you don't have that problem y'all
[1:16:07] pray for me I know y'all don't know
[1:16:09] about anything about that but but you
[1:16:11] know and then they turn around and you
[1:16:13] know a little bit later they come right
[1:16:14] back to you
[1:16:15] they love on you
[1:16:17] right
[1:16:18] and you know what you know it's just it
[1:16:20] it goes right past
[1:16:24] and you know and they come right back
[1:16:25] and they don't mind asking for something
[1:16:27] and you know what if they if they need
[1:16:29] something they know where to go right
[1:16:32] right but you know sometimes we don't
[1:16:33] have we don't we get wrapped up in
[1:16:35] ourselves
[1:16:38] and we get Bound by things because the
[1:16:40] devil put things in our minds and we
[1:16:42] don't we won't go
[1:16:44] before the father
[1:16:46] they say Daddy I got a problem
[1:16:53] you know
[1:16:55] I remember I like talking about Richard
[1:16:57] every now and then
[1:16:59] people might forget he's my brother
[1:17:02] but you know Richard had a problem one
[1:17:04] time and
[1:17:05] and you know he was he was so afraid
[1:17:07] that he was that he had to go tell Mom
[1:17:09] and Daddy
[1:17:10] always outside he was shaking like a
[1:17:12] leaf
[1:17:15] and he's like well I don't know what I'm
[1:17:16] gonna do I don't know what I'm gonna do
[1:17:18] I don't want them on there I'm just I'm
[1:17:20] just I'm just a nervous wreck
[1:17:22] and you know what I done
[1:17:24] that's it come on
[1:17:27] got a hold of him drug him in the house
[1:17:30] mom and dad was in the bed I would woke
[1:17:32] him up he said you need to come to the
[1:17:34] living room
[1:17:35] we come in the living room
[1:17:38] I said well listen
[1:17:40] you can tell them the problem or I'm
[1:17:42] going to tell the problem but the thing
[1:17:43] is is they're going to find out tonight
[1:17:48] and you know what he told them
[1:17:50] but you don't want to come to find out
[1:17:52] it wasn't near as bad as he thought it
[1:17:53] was going to be
[1:17:55] but you know what he was such a nervous
[1:17:56] wreck because in his mind he had already
[1:17:59] knew how things was going to play out
[1:18:01] but you know what we have an intercessor
[1:18:05] we need somebody to intercede for us
[1:18:09] why because you know sometimes we get
[1:18:11] wrapped up in ourselves that the Holy
[1:18:13] Ghost intercedes on our behalf because
[1:18:15] we don't know what's going on because
[1:18:16] sometimes we can't pray we don't know
[1:18:19] how to handle the situation but you know
[1:18:21] we have one that intercedes for us just
[1:18:24] the same way that takes over the in the
[1:18:26] situation that will intercede for you on
[1:18:29] your behalf and give you what you have
[1:18:30] native who will come and meet your need
[1:18:32] right
[1:18:33] right
[1:18:37] but you know the thing is is we we get
[1:18:39] wrapped up but you know God is here to
[1:18:41] meet our need is mindful of us
[1:18:43] if we come before him
[1:18:48] and you know
[1:18:50] We Lay ourselves before God he'll come
[1:18:53] and he'll meet our need and he'll give
[1:18:54] us what we have need of
[1:18:56] all right
[1:18:59] and then we'll
[1:19:00] the the third the third one
[1:19:04] in the in the Oracles of speaking of the
[1:19:06] oracles the first one was was the was
[1:19:10] the place the second one was was the was
[1:19:12] the person that God's that God uses to
[1:19:15] speak through in the second one and this
[1:19:16] in the third one I want to speak up is
[1:19:19] the is the is the message or the
[1:19:21] utterance that God gives or the response
[1:19:24] that God gives and the the person that
[1:19:28] that stands out to me in in this
[1:19:30] situation is is David when David was
[1:19:33] rejected as king and he was overthrown
[1:19:35] and he was run out and and a second and
[1:19:37] second Samuel here in the 16th chapter
[1:19:39] he says
[1:19:41] and when King David came to baharam
[1:19:44] behold fence came out a man of the
[1:19:47] family of the House of Saul whose name
[1:19:48] was shimai the son of Guerra he came
[1:19:51] forth and cursed steel as he came and he
[1:19:54] cast stones at David and all and all the
[1:19:57] Servants of King David and all the
[1:19:58] people of the mighty men were on his
[1:20:01] right hand and on his left
[1:20:02] and thus said Shema when he cursed come
[1:20:04] out come out thou bloody man and thou
[1:20:07] man of belly hell
[1:20:09] he said the Lord hath returned upon thee
[1:20:12] all the blood of the House of Saul and
[1:20:13] who stead thou Hast reigned and the Lord
[1:20:16] hath delivered the kingdom into the hand
[1:20:17] of Absalom thy son and behold Thou Art
[1:20:21] taken in thy Mischief because thou art a
[1:20:23] bloody man
[1:20:24] then said abishay the son of zerua
[1:20:28] and to the king why should this dead dog
[1:20:31] curse my Lord the king let me go over I
[1:20:34] pray then take off his head and the King
[1:20:36] said why have I to do with ye you sons
[1:20:38] of zerua
[1:20:40] so let him curse because the Lord hath
[1:20:42] said unto him curse David who shall say
[1:20:45] then wherefore hast thou done so
[1:20:48] and David said unto abishay and all this
[1:20:51] service behold my son which came forth
[1:20:53] of my bowel seeketh my life how much
[1:20:55] more now may this benjamite do it let
[1:20:59] him alone and let him curse for the Lord
[1:21:00] hath bit in him and it may be that the
[1:21:03] Lord will look upon my Affliction and
[1:21:05] that the Lord will Christ me good for
[1:21:07] this cursing this day
[1:21:09] and as David and his men went by the way
[1:21:11] Shema went along on the hillside against
[1:21:14] over against him cursed as he went and
[1:21:16] threw stones at him and cast dust
[1:21:20] and brother Brando says in in the
[1:21:21] message of Statuary of a perfect man he
[1:21:25] said and he and his own people turned
[1:21:27] him off and throw things at him spit at
[1:21:29] him and made fun of him as he started up
[1:21:31] the hill and he was rejected he said oh
[1:21:33] how perfect the Son of God 800 years
[1:21:35] later rejected king among his own people
[1:21:38] sat on the the mountain wept over
[1:21:40] Jerusalem as a rejected King what was it
[1:21:42] God reflecting himself in those prophets
[1:21:45] reflecting Christ
[1:21:47] now there's a few things that you know
[1:21:50] when you look at when you look at David
[1:21:51] and and this In this passage of
[1:21:54] scripture well and you know most of us
[1:21:57] know that know the story but you know
[1:21:59] what what stands out to me is that when
[1:22:01] when David was overthrown
[1:22:03] it was because of his own his own sin
[1:22:07] caused him to be overthrown by his own
[1:22:08] family
[1:22:10] and when when he was overthrown and he
[1:22:12] was and he was run out and Absalom took
[1:22:15] over the kingdom
[1:22:16] and then when she and I come out and
[1:22:18] cursed him you know
[1:22:20] he stands out there and and he says he
[1:22:24] could you know he first calls him and he
[1:22:26] says you're the man of belly ill
[1:22:29] which if you if you know that that is a
[1:22:32] false god
[1:22:34] so and so you know you don't even serve
[1:22:36] you don't even serve God
[1:22:38] you're the Antichrist
[1:22:41] he said he said in the Lord hath have
[1:22:43] returned unto thee all the blood of the
[1:22:45] house the salt see the thing is is he
[1:22:47] comes out and he accuses David of
[1:22:50] running of ruining Saul and running Saul
[1:22:52] off the throne
[1:22:54] but you know it wasn't it wasn't David
[1:22:55] that run Saul off the throne it was it
[1:22:58] was his incomplete obedience to the word
[1:23:01] that took him off the throne
[1:23:04] and when he went out there Samuel told
[1:23:06] Saul he said he said you know God is
[1:23:08] today has rent this the uh when when
[1:23:11] Saul grabbed a hold of his of Samuel's
[1:23:13] garment and he ripped it he said and God
[1:23:15] is the Kingdom from you today and given
[1:23:18] one who's better than you are and has
[1:23:19] given him the kingdom and you know
[1:23:21] anointed David to be the king but you
[1:23:23] know it was it was not anything that God
[1:23:26] that David had done God had taken away
[1:23:28] from him because what Samuel I mean what
[1:23:30] Saul had done of his own accord
[1:23:33] and then when all these things had taken
[1:23:35] place
[1:23:36] and he said you know because of the
[1:23:39] Mischief that you've done he hadn't done
[1:23:41] anything
[1:23:43] Saul was the one that tried to kill
[1:23:44] David
[1:23:45] multiple times you know we we know that
[1:23:48] you know even the even his his men told
[1:23:50] David he went down there and he cut off
[1:23:52] part of uh Saul's garment
[1:23:55] and he walked away
[1:23:57] and you know the scripture says that he
[1:23:59] was struck by that and he said he he was
[1:24:02] guilty by that and he called back to
[1:24:04] Saul and he told him he said my Lord he
[1:24:07] said I've cut off your garment
[1:24:09] it broke his heart that he done that but
[1:24:11] he said you know I want you to know he
[1:24:13] said I could have taken your life but I
[1:24:15] didn't he said you know they were there
[1:24:16] were men they were in my ear telling me
[1:24:18] to take your life and I didn't
[1:24:21] and he went out there and he told him
[1:24:23] said look here they were accusing him of
[1:24:25] ruining sawing and running him off the
[1:24:27] throne and now he said now you know the
[1:24:29] same thing that you've done to Saul was
[1:24:30] happening to you your sons run you off
[1:24:32] the throne
[1:24:33] and you know abishay says Lord let me
[1:24:36] just go out there and cut his head off
[1:24:39] he's he's a dead dog he's worthless they
[1:24:42] said no he said the Lord has told him to
[1:24:44] do that the Lord has told him to curse
[1:24:48] and he said and in the verse scripture
[1:24:50] he said that that it may be that the
[1:24:52] Lord will look upon my affliction
[1:24:54] and that the Lord will require me good
[1:24:57] for this cursing this day
[1:24:59] and you know it was very low that he had
[1:25:01] to walk out of there rejected
[1:25:05] that he would that he was rejected of
[1:25:06] the people and there he was and he was
[1:25:08] facing this and it was it was very
[1:25:10] difficult
[1:25:14] when was the last time somebody threw
[1:25:16] stones at you
[1:25:19] sometimes that people say things about
[1:25:21] us
[1:25:23] sticks and stones or break your bones
[1:25:24] but words won't ever hurt you
[1:25:29] but that's not always the way it goes
[1:25:33] but he says you know the Lord will look
[1:25:35] upon this he said God told him to curse
[1:25:37] me he didn't do anything and he walked
[1:25:40] on
[1:25:41] and brother Brown you know speaking
[1:25:43] there was Christ rejected he said how
[1:25:46] would I've covered you with my wings
[1:25:50] he said I would have drawn you to myself
[1:25:51] and he said but y'all rejected y'all
[1:25:52] didn't want it
[1:25:54] you know he weeped over Jerusalem
[1:25:58] first Thessalonians 1 5 says for Our
[1:26:01] Gospel came not unto you in word only
[1:26:03] but also in power in the Holy Ghost and
[1:26:06] much Assurance as you know what manner
[1:26:07] of men we were among you for your sake
[1:26:09] and you have become followers of us and
[1:26:11] of the Lord having received the word in
[1:26:14] much Affliction with joy of the Holy
[1:26:17] Ghost
[1:26:18] say it's not always easy because there's
[1:26:21] a joy of receiving the word but it comes
[1:26:23] with it with a heart with Affliction
[1:26:25] with hardness there's a hard way to go
[1:26:28] and then and then in scripture you know
[1:26:31] we know a few chapters later and and in
[1:26:33] second Samuel 19 when it continues on
[1:26:36] and and you know he comes back
[1:26:38] and we try to say save some of the
[1:26:41] reading
[1:26:43] and he says it's so King
[1:26:45] he said so the king returned and came to
[1:26:48] Jordan and Judah came to Hugo to go meet
[1:26:50] the king to conduct the king over Jordan
[1:26:52] and Shema the son of Garrow benjamite
[1:26:55] who was of borua cast down hasted and
[1:26:59] came down with the man of Judah to meet
[1:27:01] King David after he had been restored to
[1:27:04] the throne
[1:27:06] and there were a thousand men of
[1:27:07] Benjamin with him and zebra the servant
[1:27:10] of the House of Saul and his 15 sons and
[1:27:12] 20 servants with him and they went over
[1:27:14] Jordan before the before the king and
[1:27:16] they went over a ferry boat to carry
[1:27:18] over the king's household and do what he
[1:27:20] what he thought good and Shema the king
[1:27:22] the son of Gareth fell down before the
[1:27:24] king as he come over Jordan and said
[1:27:27] unto the king let not my Lord impute
[1:27:29] iniquity unto me neither do thou
[1:27:32] remember that which thy servant did
[1:27:33] perversely the day that my Lord the king
[1:27:35] went out of Jerusalem that the king
[1:27:37] should take it to heart
[1:27:39] for that servant doth know that I have
[1:27:42] sinned therefore behold I am come the
[1:27:44] the first this day
[1:27:46] of all the house of Joseph to go down to
[1:27:49] meet my Lord the king but abishay now
[1:27:53] this is but abishay the son of zerua
[1:27:55] said answered and said shall not sham I
[1:27:58] be put to death for this because he
[1:28:00] cursed the Lord's anointed
[1:28:02] and David said what have I to do with
[1:28:04] you you sons of zarua that you should do
[1:28:07] this that you should be adversaries unto
[1:28:09] me there shall
[1:28:12] shall there any man be put to death This
[1:28:15] Day in Israel for for do not I know that
[1:28:18] I am this day King over Israel therefore
[1:28:22] the king said unto Shema Thou shalt not
[1:28:24] die and the King swear unto him
[1:28:29] it really struck me you know so when
[1:28:31] when Shema went out there and he cursed
[1:28:33] David but when he saw that he was coming
[1:28:35] back
[1:28:36] he run out there to David's feet and he
[1:28:38] bowed down and he said Lord don't bring
[1:28:41] your money don't remember my iniquity
[1:28:43] unto me again unto this day he said
[1:28:45] because he said I was one of the first
[1:28:46] ones when I saw you coming back I went
[1:28:48] right out to meet you I didn't want you
[1:28:50] to come on there and try and look for me
[1:28:51] and find me some other time I wanted to
[1:28:53] meet you on your way back in because I
[1:28:55] didn't want this to be over my head
[1:28:59] those same ones that that they saw and
[1:29:02] and abishay was standing there and he
[1:29:04] said let's just go ahead and kill him
[1:29:07] when they saw because you know what he
[1:29:09] cursed us he threw rocks at us as we
[1:29:11] walked out of Jerusalem
[1:29:13] and he come back and said no God told
[1:29:15] him to do that
[1:29:18] and David said no he said you won't die
[1:29:20] today
[1:29:21] and swear unto him yeah
[1:29:24] when he saw the things that they had
[1:29:26] done
[1:29:27] he did not remember his iniquity even
[1:29:29] though he should have
[1:29:31] Abby Shea said how can somebody curse
[1:29:33] God's anointed and live
[1:29:36] he said no God called him to do that
[1:29:43] brother Brown says in the message
[1:29:46] a man running from the presence
[1:29:49] says
[1:29:50] and remember we're going to have to
[1:29:51] answer for it remember those who spent
[1:29:53] on Christ's answer for when David
[1:29:54] returned back from Exile he was a
[1:29:56] fugitive when he returned back and
[1:29:58] remember His fellow fell on his face and
[1:29:59] cried out for Mercy spit on David going
[1:30:01] out but he almost was ready to bathe his
[1:30:04] feet with tears when he came back and
[1:30:06] someday those who Pierce Jesus will see
[1:30:08] it and those who are piercing him today
[1:30:10] will see it also they someday they'll
[1:30:12] come back or revelation 22 he requires
[1:30:16] us to keep every word that was written
[1:30:17] every word
[1:30:19] Romans 14 11 says for it is written as I
[1:30:22] live saith the Lord every knee shall bow
[1:30:24] and every tongue shall confess that he
[1:30:26] is Lord
[1:30:28] infest tongue confessed to God
[1:30:31] that he that he is Lord
[1:30:34] that they they have
[1:30:36] turned their back on him right
[1:30:40] and you know what we know that that some
[1:30:42] that
[1:30:46] God has Mercy on people
[1:30:53] will be amazed
[1:30:55] on the day of judgment who receives
[1:30:57] eternal life and who doesn't
[1:31:00] you know as he said there's those ones
[1:31:04] they may not have wanted God had
[1:31:06] anything to do with him
[1:31:09] but you know
[1:31:11] he said unto him
[1:31:14] he said you saw me naked and you clothed
[1:31:17] me you saw me hungry and you fed me
[1:31:21] he said all those things that that they
[1:31:23] done to him and he said he said when did
[1:31:25] window when we do these things to you
[1:31:28] he said when you've done it under the
[1:31:29] least to these my brethren he said
[1:31:31] you've done it unto me
[1:31:33] you know there's there's people that's
[1:31:35] going to receive eternal life they may
[1:31:37] not wanted to have anything to do with
[1:31:38] God but maybe there's a way that they
[1:31:40] receive
[1:31:41] eternal life
[1:31:43] and people people and and you you look
[1:31:45] at the Jews
[1:31:48] they went out there and said let his
[1:31:50] blood be on our hands and our children's
[1:31:54] those being blinded that you and I can
[1:31:57] see right
[1:32:01] we're a blessed people that those people
[1:32:03] that have turned him down and rejected
[1:32:05] him that the Gentiles can come in
[1:32:08] the dogs can come in
[1:32:10] that he can that we can receive what
[1:32:13] they've what they've lost
[1:32:16] I thank God for that
[1:32:18] right that there's a there's a group out
[1:32:20] there that's going to receive eternal
[1:32:21] life because what God done right
[1:32:24] all right you said go ahead let's all
[1:32:27] stand how the musicians come
[1:32:30] I'm so glad
[1:32:31] that God has been so so wonderful to us
[1:32:37] the message
[1:32:38] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:32:42] he said and God will never speak to the
[1:32:44] church until he comes back to until it
[1:32:46] comes back to the oracles and principles
[1:32:48] that God laid down
[1:32:50] it's not dominated by some emotional or
[1:32:53] some denomination to put this in that
[1:32:55] way it'll have to come back in believing
[1:32:58] Miracles believing in signs believing in
[1:33:00] the Holy Ghost baptized in the name of
[1:33:02] Jesus Christ
[1:33:07] and all these things will have to come
[1:33:09] back to that God wants or God won't
[1:33:11] speak to them
[1:33:13] right that's right
[1:33:16] brother Brown says in the speaking of in
[1:33:18] the laodicean church age
[1:33:26] he says but what is in the mouth of the
[1:33:28] Lord he said the word is in his mouth
[1:33:30] said Matthew 4 4 but he answered and
[1:33:33] said it is written man shall not live by
[1:33:35] bread alone but by every word that
[1:33:37] proceedeth out of the mouth of God he
[1:33:39] said the word is supposed to be in our
[1:33:40] mouths too now we know that the church
[1:33:43] is his body
[1:33:45] it is here taking his place
[1:33:48] what will be in the mouth of the church
[1:33:50] the word
[1:33:52] he said first Peter 4 11 If any man
[1:33:54] speak let him speak as the oracles or
[1:33:57] the word of God
[1:34:03] the message from and this is from
[1:34:04] message things that are to be brother
[1:34:06] Brown says
[1:34:08] now if we are those attributes of God we
[1:34:10] cannot live by Creeds we cannot live by
[1:34:13] denominationalism we must live by the
[1:34:15] word because the bride is part of the
[1:34:16] bridegroom like any wife is part of her
[1:34:19] husband therefore we must be that word
[1:34:21] bride and what is that word bride
[1:34:24] the manifestation of this hour the bride
[1:34:27] not a Creator denomination but a living
[1:34:30] Oracle of God a living attribute of God
[1:34:32] displaying to the world the attributes
[1:34:34] of God in the formation of the Bride
[1:34:37] that's to be expressed in this hour that
[1:34:40] we're now living
[1:34:44] so we're to be that Oracle
[1:34:47] the word made flesh
[1:34:55] that we can be
[1:34:58] the living Tabernacle the Living God
[1:35:03] you know the scripture says take no
[1:35:05] thought
[1:35:06] what you'll say
[1:35:08] he said it'll be given to you what
[1:35:09] percentage
[1:35:12] God is taking
[1:35:15] resonance here
[1:35:16] to manifest it to the world
[1:35:21] because
[1:35:22] the world is see is is looking for
[1:35:26] reality yeah
[1:35:28] they spend a lot of time
[1:35:30] talking about reality
[1:35:33] everything is reality to now
[1:35:36] but they're missing reality
[1:35:41] but God said that he was going to make
[1:35:43] make this word known to the world
[1:35:46] has it as Peter told us
[1:35:48] it was going to be preached
[1:35:51] the best sermon ever preached is a life
[1:35:53] lived they're going to see this word and
[1:35:56] they'll be judged by it
[1:36:00] but some will receive it and some won't
[1:36:02] right
[1:36:04] but I thank God for what he's given us
[1:36:06] amen
[1:36:07] let's sing that little song
[1:36:09] I want to live
[1:36:11] the way he wants me to live
[1:36:17] I want to live
[1:36:26] I want to give
[1:36:29] until there's just no more to give if
[1:36:36] you haven't need this evening you like
[1:36:37] prayer you can come until there's just
[1:36:42] no
[1:36:43] more love I could never ever outlaw
[1:36:50] the Lord
[1:36:54] I want to live the way he wants me
[1:37:01] to live I want to give
[1:37:05] until there's just no more
[1:37:10] if I want to love
