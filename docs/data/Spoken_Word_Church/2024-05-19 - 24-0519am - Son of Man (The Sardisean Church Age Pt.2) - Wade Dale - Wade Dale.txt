TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] oh it has followed me and so glad you found me and you said me free so glad of your so glad of you amen and amen good to see everybody here this morning you know for me to come to church and be here around my little family uh it's a wonderful thing uh just to come and be around some real Believers some people who uh good conscience and knows how to listen to their conscience I've had a bad conscience all my life it slapped me many times thank God for it but I thought I had it all until the real one came and said hey you know better and you just back up and leave it alone and uh you know sometimes I think for me I Take God for granted do you ever do that all of you I mean really you stop and think you take God for granted you asked him to do something I was working on a little thing down at the shop I found a little little toy of all the things I got to do in my life I found this little toy give me a minute here anyway it had a piece missing and I couldn't find it it was a little tricycle brother Mark had it and the wheels were gone on it and everything and wanding through all my junk I found a set of wheels to put on it I took a break and I missed one of the little pedals was about as big as my thumb and I couldn't find it and I had a little bicycle working real good it took me about an hour to put it all back together and I couldn't find that pedal nowhere and I would have had made one and you can't make them exactly the same so I just said simply Lord you know where it is if you want me to have it you'll show it to me and you'll find it for me and I just said that prayer and just walked away when on about my business two or three days later I'm walking through the same path every day getting water out the refrigerator the whole nine yards and I look down and there it is and I mean you know just take him minut his word that's all I got to say God's word said it and and that's what we're going to do uh we're going to read this morning from Psalms 51 and before we go to the author let's uh let's give him some few words precious Heavenly Father we thank you for this day you've given us to come and gather around your word and father to knock the dirt off from the earth that's weighing us down lord Lift us up father and we know today that this is the place that we're fed and we're fed truth here Lord and your word is truth and your word is our lives Lord and we ask father God that you just continue sending your word here to this little pull pit and Lula feed all these pastors Lord just let them have an overflow father cuz they'll bring it to us Lord because we need it father and you know we do we need the word revealed to us more than anything there is cuz the world is getting harder and it's really not get in confusion because you sent us a prophet to teach us these things will happen and they are happening today with troubles all around the world we ask now Lord that you just touch and bless those that couldn't come in the door today for whatever reasons but Lord you bless them and be with them and bless those that are at home listening in Reach Out And Touch them today with something special father that your word goes

way I know that there's many that's help me and and thank you God for putting them in my path and this church has been the biggest thing in my life that has come in my past and I thank God that has came here at the end Lord that you can have your way with us and we ask now Lord as we go to your word let us become this word to have thy mind is the only way we can do it that we can follow through and Manifest this Lord is to have your word fully in US Lord forgive us of our sins and father those little children that walk out of here that don't come back bless them Lord as you say just have

and uh what we're going to do too is is we're going to have a couple of prayer cloths and we're going to pray over them when we get finished with the service because the afternoon service is going to be uh worship but we're going to give them to Sister June for her operation on Tuesday for her hip replacement so sister Regina if you all be seated good morning Saints good to see all of you I just want to share with everybody um these past few months maybe you can pick up some nuggets to make some changes in your life um you know we lost my brother-in-law Lonzo in January and and we funeralized him in February and then we lost Denise his wife my sister in April what happened was um we hadn't talked to her that weekend and I put my book uh on on the family feed and she didn't respond so we knew something was wrong so we had a wellness check and um they found her in the bed she had had a seizure and um underlying lupus but she didn't want to live anymore um I want to stress that clean up your house um brother John is teaching us about finances but clean up your house they were hoarders good hoarders they sales shopped till the ultimate um so cleaning out that house is what I want to ask you to pray for my sisters because I think we're all losing it um to and I'll give you an example two dumpsters two vet pickups five pickups for the homeless it's just overwhelming to do that and they're still there I had to come back because I'm under workman's comp and I have to have surgery on my knee but please that's male and female clean out your house don't leave somebody with that it's terrible it's absolutely terrible I'm very concerned for my sisters because it has been overwhelming one of them talks to me like I had never been there so that's a little disconcerning for me um I was there from the 20th as or back up so I was in Michigan visiting Kendrick and KAS and I got the call the night before I was to leave I came back repacked and I went up there so I've been up there since the 20th of April and I came back on the 11th of May so just please go into prayer tomorrow is her service her grave site service um and I won't be there so just remember me it's tomorrow at 2:00 and lift us all up in prayer please that's just what I wanted to let you all know pray for us cuz I'm concerned about it's going to be take God's therapy to get through this so just pray for us continue to pray for us please thank you amen we all have family issues and things we need to take care of and it doesn't make it easier but uh it's part of life so let's stand to our feet remember

SAT test and and uh we're looking forward to being able to sit on the couch and talk to her cuz she thinks we're all crazy anyway so um um I hope it's free so it may take a while but let's turn in the Bible to Revelations 1 verse1 it's just like that Michael you just get crazy when you get older let me read this to you this is from a man named Charles West is we turn to God for help when our foundations are shaking only to learn that it's God that's shaking them that's good y we turn to God for help when our foundations are shaking only to learn that it's God who's shaken the foundations amen so let's go to Revelations 1 we're going to continue with this sardian church age I'm going to use my computer today to go fly through some stuff so let's bow our heads Lord thank you for this day thank you for this purpose that we have of meeting Lord is to talk about you and Lord we come with expectation Lord to hear from you father through the foolishness of preaching father this is what you you ordained before the foundation the the world for us to come to Perfection is through the Sunday schools and the teachers and all the different things Lord the preachers and evangelists and pastors and Prophets You You ordained that whole group of people to bring a a group of people to Perfection and father we pray that you would help us today Lord be with the ones that are sick the ones that are not here Lord that are traveling maybe we pray that you'd just be with them Father forgive us of our sins and our mistakes that we make Lord against you just cleanse us from all unri in Jesus name amen jardian Church age this is part two we'll get to all that in just a second and we'll go over one more thing on the U tharan Church age that I'm I'm missed I want to talk about it just a second so I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last now remember the alpha bride we already been through the alpha bride right right all right but we haven't been through the Omega bride because that's you right you are the Omega bride the alpha bride's already gone on they've already done their job they've done what they supposed to do then that that same Alpha bride anointing is supposed to come back in the end time as the Omega bride everybody with me all right so that's what we're into right now but we want to see what happened here but now when we come to these middle Church ages that's all become eroded man's ideas Creeds doctrines and then remember God said I'm going to kill him with death all right with doctrines because Doctrine is what kills us but here God says I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last what thou see us write in the book and send it to these seven Church ages Ephesus Smyrna pergamus thara Sardis Philadelphia and L to see and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one liken to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about to paps with a golden girdle you may be seated and I'll read Revelations 3:1 we're now in Revelations chap 3 and unto the angel of the church in Sardis right these things sayith he that hath the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars God is telling us in every age that he's got it he starts off and say look I got it I got it handled I know what I'm doing I've got the stars in my hand I've got the churches in my hand and I know what I'm doing then he goes I Know Thy works that thou H has a name that thou livest and are dead now remember before the Dark Ages there was no such thing as a denomination by name Baptist Methodist Pentecostal there was not a name until we get to this ttir age when we come out of that into Sardis when we come into the sardian church age there's a name comes out that you liveing by but you're dead all right Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain they are ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect before God this is a statement that God's telling us remember therefore how thou Hast received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch I will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I will come unto thee or upon thee thou Hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defile their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy thank God he comes to a place and he says I got a group that's worthy all right and I'm going to work on them and I'm going to work through them because remember as God goes he's fluid through the church ages he he doesn't stop remember he just continues going on so he's got to bring an anointing to these sardian people that are a little bit different but I want you to realize one thing I was thinking about this yesterday as we build foundations to build a building on all that is something that you and I are standing on today all right we've all if you've been born again or you just started in your journey if you've been Justified you were justified by the same justification that Luther had hello all right cuz that was his Revelation but now God put him in the body in that Revelation but we come up to the Revelation now and we see that I'm going to do a a sermon a little bit later on after we get finished with this cuz you got to understand that when when Martin Luther he had the same Holy Ghost you did right God's not de different he don't give different Holy Ghost but a holy the Holy Ghost only works by what words you have so Martin Luther had a had the Holy Ghost he didn't have the fullness now you'll hear Brother R say they had part well listen if you got part of the Holy Ghost you got the Holy Ghost right okay he had the Holy Ghost in his soul he's very important right but there was a lot of things Luther did we were talking about yesterday he caused a lot of problems being a human being but brother I'll read it to you in a few minutes brother R said Jonah had a lot of problems too but he was a prophet all right so we have to take the prophetic part that that Lu or had that is your very Foundation to start your Christian Journey everybody with me we can't do away with that then same way with John Wesley we can't do away with that we got to come to sanctification then we got to come to the new birth but when you plant a garden as Zach's planted and found out the deer eat his too that when you plant a garden and you look out through there there's nothing and all of a sudden there's two little green shoots pop up that's what the deer like the two shoots pop up well that's important that's not corn but it's identifying itself from the life that's in it that this is going to be corn if you let it mature and keep the devil dear off of it you'll be able to grow all right I told you it happened thou Hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy worth y he that overcometh shall be clothed in white rment see that that group of people coming out of the Dark Ages we can't we can't negate that they that they were a powerful church cuz anybody with the Holy Ghost is powerful but like I said before I'm trying to formulate a a sermon by the help of the Lord that'll show you why that you've got the Holy Ghost today it it feeds on the word for your day Martin Luther had the Holy Ghost Columba had the Holy Ghost for their day and it fed on what word they had all right but it it makes them different to a degree but remember the Holy Ghost is an individual a timid person brother Brown said right he's very timid so in other words if you're going to read the word a a different way come on Martin Luther read that just shall live by faith God said that's it but he moved over and said we're still going to baptize father Son and Holy Ghost we still believe in eternal hell now remember God don't move over that way that's man's ideas but he winked I thank God that brother brandham was a a southerner he said God winked at their ignorance like they're coming you know they they're my people and I'm going to read you a quote here in just a few minutes where brother Brown said God was happy with that age see we may not be happy with that age cuz they drank beer and they smoked the pipe and and Martin Luther caused some problems in his in his personal life and different things but he had a message to bring and then you and I know then now that the importance of the message that we have that he brought the fullness back though not not the not the in between not the reformers but he brought the alpha message back to us in the end time he that overcome the saint shall be clothed in white rment and I will not blot his name out of the book of life because you can have that done you know that but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels He that ha an ear let him hear what the spirit say the churches so we've coming out of the th tyan age which is the Dark Age it was 900 years of persecution and listen they set up a hierarchy they set up a hierarchy that was so strong that even Martin Luther got caught up in it he came out but remember and I didn't bring the quote brother Ry said that that he came out but he didn't come all the way out he tried to bring some of the things with him to from the Catholic Church into into what he was doing because he was a reformer now remember he reformed now listen when you reform somebody you send them to AA you send them to different place that's Reformation you try to reform them amen but restoration is get them with the baptism of the Holy Ghost in This day and time and they won't drink a drop of beer ever in their entire life I don't care if they've been a drunk ever since they was a baby all right so that's the difference in reformation and restoring or restoration all right he's restoring us back to the faith of the Fathers as we'll get to in the other Church in the church age that we're living in and we'll spend a pretty good bit of time in that in our church age kind of pulling apart what has been going on and most of you are living it today you're living this church age but remember we get all the blessings and the curses of the other one remember I read just quote not long ago where brother R said whatever evil was in that age it's going to be evil in this age it started out with woman worship over here with Dina in Ephesus and it comes up with this person right here in saara and it's going to actually end up in a building a church building the Vatican but she had daughters too but they're all dead we'll look at it just a second so the th age lasted 900 years and Columba wasn't even in that age so there was a group of people that took his message caught the Revelation and come on in and brought that message to a group of people wasn't a very big group of people but they were there and it was the ARX anointing which is laboring like I said continual sacrifice you sacri oxs were sacrificed so but the meaning of that thyre means dominating female so it begin to be that you look in the day and time that we're living in now it's pretty much controlled by women or it's controlled by a woman at woman's attitude or a woman's um uh brother Brown said it was a woman's Nation we were 13 you know 13 Nations so it's a woman's nation and why would we say that is because when we come under Reformation we see that you're reformed to a place but you continue to wear I'm not saying you but you continue to wear what the world wears you continue it you not come all the way out but see once you become fully restored once you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost for your day you you quit wearing pants you'll quit you'll quit doing the things that you did before all right where we'll see here in a minute where he talking about works works is Faith expressed we know brother Brian preached that sermon and we'll read something he he said off of there but you got to remember that not only just works is not going to do it and not only is just Faith going to do it I'll show you my faith by my works all right I Know Thy works and charity and service and faith and patience and thy Works he says this four times says it three times then he says his works and the last be more than the first not with standing I have a few things against you they still suffered or they still allowed and that was our their problem and our problem we allow hello somebody we allow that's brother Bob was talking about conscience we allow that Spirit to come Among Us and if we don't get rid of it it captivates Ates us cuz what does a woman do a beautiful woman captivates you hello somebody John was at John was in The Book of Revelations and he saw that church that woman and he admired it right that means he looked on it and he thought man that's pretty but remember it was full of death we know that which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed un Idols I gave her space to repent look how many times it says repent I gave her space to repent and she repented not behold I will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into great Tri now this is God speaking all right this is God speaking this is red letter in your Bible if you'll read it this is this is Jesus Christ talking to John and John's writing it down all right so this is not hear say this is what God's going to do to this group of people all right I will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into Great Tribulation except they repent of their deeds and I will kill her children with death all right and all the churches cuz remember you get a child and thank god brother Anderson's in the back I guess he found that book CH kids are like wet cement kids are wet cement from Amazon and I got it the other day and I've been reading it you take a child and you formulate in that child you can formulate anything you want to just about it if you just keep bombarding with a certain thing right and they'll grow up being what the same thing remember brother BR said mama was a flapper come on down all the way H okay all right and I will kill her children with death cuz cuz God's not going to kill them physically he's going to kill them spiritually all right and then they're going to die the death and come up at the second resurrection and who the second death that's where you if you come up in the Resurrection the second Resurrection you got to stand before the white Throne judgment we don't want to do that we want to come up in the first resurrection we want to have the new birth we want to have the Holy Ghost in our soul and know that all right and then that works will show and all the church shall know that I am he which searches the Reigns and hearts I will give unto every one of you according to your works all right now watch but unto you I say unto the rest in thara as many as have not this Doctrine and which have not known the depths of Satan as they speak I will put upon you none other burden so he's not going to put any more on them but what is required and that's to get through that age be a Christian and get through that church age all right see you and I have a different burden you and I have a bigger burden we have a let's get out of here burden we have a let's get the Saints out of the ground burden we have a body change burden that they didn't have we do all right and that's our desire that that's our call in this church age is to come to Perfection they weren't required to come to per Perfection Martin Luther wasn't required to come to Perfection like we come to Perfection all right everybody with me but that which you have already hold fast till I come I was thinking this morning listen if it's just a thread hold on to it amen if it's just a thread of Hope hang on to it hang on to your kids as brother Donnie was praying hang on to them doesn't matter how far they go hang on to them all right live the life before him that'll probably help but that which you have already hold fast till I come and he that overcometh and keepeth look my works so now he's come to your Works your Works your Works my works until the end to him will I give power over the Nations and remember this age is the ox age it's an age of works and here's James 2:1 17 and I'm going to read you a quote brother BR that I hadn't read before and it's really outstanding it'll explain to you because there is not a fight in a message but there always been well works and Faith Works well I'm going to work work work work work don't have to have a whole they work together all right thank God for a prophet even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone yeah a man may say thou Hast faith and I have Works show me thy faith without thy works and I will show thee my faith by my works there's no way for you to have faith in God and not show works right that's right totally different than the works that you showed out there in the world cuz they show works out there too you know for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also brother BR says here says I Know Thy works the Son of God himself believe me for the very Works he put an emphasis on his own Works while on Earth The Works that he did were ordained of God to inspire faith in him it was a great part of his ministry His Holy Spirit and the apostle Paul said for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto what good works but now it's created by the workmanship that you're in Christ Jesus is why you come to that good works CU really it's not your works anymore if you have faith if you have truly the faith of God it's not your works it's God working through you working his Works through you that that's a revelation is his Works you're you're not well bless no you're going to do it because of the works that the Bible has already written you're just taking it out and making it live that's what you're doing now look created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath ordained that we should walk in them so it's ordained by God that we walk in them that we show Works Ephesians 2:1 these Works were to inspire faith in him as they would show forth that relationship to him that Paul described as created in him in this verse he is commending his children because they were living changed lives their Works testify to a new spirit within does yours does your Works testify to a new spirit within men saw their good works and glorified God yes sir if you are a Christian you're going to do what is right like brother Bob was talking about conscience you may do something wrong but quickly quickly oh God that was that was me that that was me that wasn't that I got caught oh go ahead and get silent I'll just preach on me today your Works will show that your heart is right and it won't be something that you put on for you will do his will when no one but God sees you and you will do his will even if it cost you your life amen now here's around the quote that I wanted to read and I want to bring these two together now the two men that were talking on faith is Paul all right cuz he talks about unmar favor he talks about Abraham all right believe God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness all right so I'm going to back up just a second M James testified though Abraham by what man saw in Abraham he produced a child he walked with God he had God around him all the time Paul Justified Abraham by what God saw in Abraham see that's why Paul's a prophet Paul was a prophet that could look and see and and know that that he picks up the mind of God that you and I are the same way we're justified by what what by what God saw but when we're Justified and Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost man's going to be able to see that if people can't see a change in your life right you need to get the Holy Ghost now see now James says he's justified by his Works Paul said he's justified by faith but see Abraham believed God that's what God saw in him all right put your name in there it's not Abraham anymore okay don't he believe God that's what God saw in him he believed it but then when he went to acting as it were already done that's what man saw in him all right people around Abraham thought he was crazy he was 100 years old we're going to have a kid any any moment now but one day he walked out of that tent with a baby in his hand now let me tell you something that's the the culmination that's his faith was expressed by that work that he brought out that baby same way with me and you does your words exp express your faith your works right that's why we come to church I know it's hard hard to get up but it's what you do as a Christian I wouldn't want to do anything else there was no option some people have options on Sunday well I don't have an option on Sunday we don't have an option on Sunday you can if you want to but I you know I just you know we'll come to church and I'll preach when I can and uh see you later uh I think I'll just stop right now it's time to go home I need to go to the bathroom and if I fell asleep it'd really be it' really be something wouldn't it where was I because our works Express what faith we have now watch a prophet our wordss Express what faith we have not Faith we're getting faith that we have all right but if we're afraid to act on what we believe then we don't believe it that's right that's what I want to bring you right there if we are afraid to act on what we believe then we don't believe it see you got to believe it all right he said I Know Thy works and the last to be more than the first this is certainly remarkable as the darkness of the age increased as the honor rooll of the martyrs grew lengthier day by day they worked all the harder they served all the more as I was telling you before that's strange I have a tooth a lord now make two of them hurt y'all don't pray that right okay well as they were more persecuted they said pour it on they worked harder look they worked all the harder they served all the more and their faith increased amen that's the key for me and you our faith has got to increase it cannot Wan or it cannot get weaker if it gets weaker let's go back to the other quote you don't believe it go back and start to working on the believing part they worked all the harder they served all the more and their faith increased let the enemy attempt to thwart our service to the Lord our reply is increased service right when the faint are crying in fear that is the time to shout the victory that's totally contrary to your nature though totally contrary to the human nature is is to say pour it on I heard give me two amen but I thought we were supposed to overcome and it's not what it's how we overcome by what believing and having faith just like Abraham well I don't see nothing Abraham didn't say God I don't see nothing he just kept walking just kept walking kept walking and look to the world or to the let's just put it this way to the doctors it looked more impossible every day he went further from the 75 years old that he did have a kid by everybody with me he did have him and Hagar did have a child so at 70 something years old so he could produce but now he had to keep getting f and further away from that to where he can say God I'm dead I can't do it no more and God said that's exactly where I wanted you at that's the same way with me and you he wants us dead too much eye going on brother R said look I want to give a warning right here it says concerning the last days that because of abounding iniquity the love of many will wax cold and the layout to see in her last days selflove and love for material things will take the place of the true love of God we need to guard against the power of sin in these last days so many are getting so hard because they haven't realize the effects of this last day Spirit that's why we preach so hard about spirits and and all these different things about even the little foxes this SP Divine it's the little things that we have to deal with it's time to draw nigh to God and let him fill our lives with his love or we will F the coldness of the last day church and reject the truth of God which alone is able to help us as we said many times many times many times before when you get in trouble you disappear this is the place you should be you show me another place you should be home having a py party right home having a pity party oh whoo is me me me me okay we'll get off of that bless let try to reverse this thing let's try to reverse it if we start if we start feeling bad and and we think that remember as I said the quote I read to you Sunday or Wednesday I think it was where the man said look he said I have given God a million reasons to hate me and he still ain't changed his mind about me that's pretty cool cuz God remember God can't change his mind all right let's just start realizing we're in the mind of God we are the mind of God we're a piece of God's mind that back part that brother R was talking about so this church age is is just full of church everything's everybody's going to these big Cathedrals now they got these great big um um Mo mosque and all those different things that that man has built they put church and state together and the female is starting to dominate or the church is starting to dominate not the true church false church right all right it started in Ephesus as Diana worship of a woman thara was the prophetess on a three-legged stool and then our age is the great and her daughters and we'll get to that as we go a little bit further cuz remember why did he say come out of her my people her the church the church ideas come out of her my people not come out not he didn't even say come out of the world he said come out of her he pointed exactly where to come out of come out of that and I will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that I am he which searches the Reigns and hearts and I will give unto every one of you according to your Works 1 Timothy 5:6 but she that liveth in she she back to the church again but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth and listen we appreciate all the programs and all the things things that that the Baptist do and the Methodist and Pentecostals and all that but remember if they don't come back to the true word of God that's all God's worried about am it's his word amen all right his word will not return void somebody will take it and somebody will produce what the word amen not produce bigger churches not produce you know programs and and all this stuff that and we appreciate them doing that the food F Banks and all those different things and as Regina said taking the taking the clothes to the homeless I mean that's and that's a Ministry people need help but where do you first need help at right here and that's your house right here's where you need help first June always says and I appreciate every time we get on a plane I start chuckling the when they tell you that you're losing cabin pressure and this oxygen thing's going to fall down out of the sky and you better really start praying when that thing falls out you when that thing falls out what do they tell you to do put yours on first not your neighbors put your mask on first cuz without your mask you can't help your neighbor hello somebody so without the new birth and without Shoring yourself up and getting your oxygen right you're not going to be able to help you'll pass out and then you're both going to pass out and die it's a good analogy CU if you look at and and and when you counsel people you you look at the different things and and they always well if my if my aunt suie was good I'd be good if if if my mama quit being so mean to me it's always pushing it outward put your mask on first if you want to have a successful marriage put your mask on first start working on you finger amen that's right Regina you are the problem you are your own problem though but she that liveth in pleasure look at the world they got everything in the world now that you to pleasure yourself with I mean games and you can you can be sitting somewhere and playing video games and you can be sitting on the internet there all the different things that that just blows your mind up with all this information and we got Google and we got Yahoo and we got all these different things that we can look up stuff and and I enjoy it because I like to go into Wikipedia and look at some of like I did with Martin Luther and do some research you can really use Satan's tool if you'll use it right everybody with me you can use that technology if you use it right you can get some good information and it's pretty quick but remember all that pleasuring that's going on out in the world is dead it's dead and you know what dead means let me show you what dead means and I'll get back to it it's a separation or that separation whether natural or violent of the soul and the body by which the life on Earth is ended that's why you're dead while you living if you're not born again your life you may be breathing you may be sucking air you may be thinking right you may be acting you or doing something but you're dead and I hate to see that I hate to say that but all the preachers that are not preaching the true word of God they're dead amen right you can amen if you want to but that's what brother Ram he condemned that whole system out there and I want to bring it back in there out here condemn everything that's off but remember condemn it with Grace yes cuz you were condemned at one time yourself I was reading some quotes back here where brother Brown and I know he said it he said it about three times he said my whole makeup is Grace my whole makeup is Grace you St brother Rand a man he just cut their heads off and sliced them up and spit them out but it was Grace it was Grace to the people that God come to me and you and said hey I got a message here I'm in a I I'm in a I'm in a pickle here and God says uh I'm going to change your cucumber into a pickle I'm going to take you pickle and make a pickle out of you remember what the pickling process is baptismo baptismo it makes you a pickle can't be a cucumber you may look like one but you're not going to taste like one or you're not going to act like one all right so what will be the punishment of the Harlot and her children now watch the Harlot and her children so it's going to be people that get put in hell it's not buildings right okay first he said I will cast her into a bed according to the last part of verse 22 it will be a bed of tribulation or or the Great Tribulation that is what will come upon the Harlot and her daughters secondly it says says that he will kill them excuse me with death or as a literal translation says let them be put to death with death and we're going to explain that just a second we did before we're going to back up explain it just for a minute this is a strange saying we might say let a man be put to death by hanging or by elocution or some other way but this says let them be put to death by death death itself is the cause of their death cuz they're dead while they're living listen you and I were born dead death reigned I'm quoting scripture death rained in our members naturally and physically if the Rapture don't take place we're going to die naturally but that's just this thing going away if we die out and take Christ then we don't have to die again we may fall asleep in this right but we're alive in Jesus Christ we're alive in that sixth dimension More Alive now than ever before we just don't realize that though we want to hang on sure because we have a threat of Hope or we have humanity is in our heart for the people but my if somebody's suffering like you wouldn't believe it's better to let them go let them go and go over in that another dimension and and hide away from the the world and hide away from uh arthritis and cancer and all listen there ain't no cancer in the sixth Dimension there ain't no diabetes in the sixth Dimension it all stays here devil you're stand here you can't even crawl around in that sixth Dimension you can't even get your hands on anybody in that sixth Dimension that's how much God really believes that he is going to do it through you and when they come back here you think a look on the devil's face oh I I I put them in the ground I give them cancer and I give them diabetes and heart attacks and and they're gone I I don't know where they're at that their body's laying here in the grave I see that but I can't find their soul you know why cuz it's in the six Dimension but they're going to absolutely come out of that sixth Dimension and they're going to walk into this one and they going to pick up their body that the devil killed hello somebody and then the devil's going to have a real bad look on his face he's going to say how did that happen well it happened for me and you it happened for us believing and having faith in what we've already got and then build on that Faith like they did in that fourth dimension keep building on that Faith keep building on that Faith because remember there was a there was come on there was a new birth coming right that that fourth dimension we're talking about it had to die it had to go in the ground amen according to the Bible the corn of wheat had to go in the ground the word had to go in the ground but it had life in it pra and even if it's just two shoot that without them you cut them off you don't get no corn but then it goes to the stock those two shoots die come to the stock stock has a tassel every bit of it comes from that life it's in that one seed you watch that corn man that corn is it's wrapped up it's in that thing it goes up you know it's got the leaves that go off like this and you'll watch it if you watch it you know a day or two you'll see it doing this it don't get it from somewhere else it get it from the life is down in the roots from that Original Seed and then it opens up like this and then you see a ear of corn coming out like this real small don't want to eat it then can't plant it either but once that pollen comes down and hits that hits those do you know why there's a Shu the shook protects the corn right but you know the tassel that comes out that stuff that comes out that you have to scrape off every one of them is connected to one seed in that corn kernel every one of them so they've got to be pollinated to grow I hope somebody's getting something out of that they got to be pollinated by the word of God to grow if you listen if you don't for some reason that it that it's hid and and the um and I meant to tell D that you got to leave a room enough to where the wind will blow that will blow that uh tassel it'll blow it on to that U corn and when the thing's hanging off like this it's got to attach itself to it but if you put it in a different situation that's why you get ears of corn it don't have like you whole one side don't have any right you've seen them before and they're all not fully developed somebody with me with this I hope you get the spiritual part of this okay you're not fully developed okay and you look kind of ugly okay so that's why because you didn't get truly correctly pollinated go back and read the spoken words Original Seed and you'll get all that the minute the First Church of Rome organized it died the minute that the Lutheran organized death came in and they died the Pentecostals came along last and they organized the spirit left though they don't believe it oh they were sitting right there while he was preaching it but he did that marriage brought death then the light of the Oneness of the godhead came they organized they died too then after the fire of God fell on Ohio oh he's talking about himself now after the fire of God fell on Ohio River 1933 a healing Revival swept the world but it's never come through any organization God went outside the Pentecostal group outside of organization and what he's going to do in the future is going to be outside organization because remember it's got to be the alpha bride it's got to be the same as Omega so the alpha bride came out from they had no organization Paul had to come out of Pharisees Sadducees he had to come out of that cuz he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees said he had to come out of that forget everything and then what go on with his message well same thing with brother randam he had to come out of that church he was in the Baptist then he come to the Pentecostal people who accepted him for a Time until he start talking about them God can't work through the dead he can only work through the living members those living members are outside of Babylon the world so you see death organization came and the church died or to make it pler death became a resident wherein shortly before only life reigned as the original Eve brought death to mankind so now organization has brought death for organization is the product of the double corruptors nanism and bism propagated by a propheus jezebel so there's a your definition of death that separation natural violent of the soul and the body by which the life on Earth is ended now that's the way we see death if some we say somebody's passed away or died which means that there's a shell there and the Soul's gone right all right but now what about being dead though while you're living while you're still breathing while you're still standing up while you're still going to church you have no life in you so if you have no life in you there's a separation and your life on Earth is ended even though you have pleasure you're dead while you're living Matthew 6: 211 say therefore where your treasure is there will heart be also the Light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light but if thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of Darkness if therefore the light that is in thee be Darkness how great is that Darkness or how great is that death so under the law we were talking about the other day real quick under the law in Exodus and all the different ones Leviticus listen if you did something you didn't go to court you died okay keep Sabbath day some people wouldn't live in the message very long everyone that defileth it in other words don't come to church shall surely be put to death for whosoever doeth any work therein that Soul shall be cut off from among his people that's how reverent they were under the law six days May word be done but in the seventh is the Sabbath of rest holy to the Lord whosoever doeth any work in the in the Sabbath day he shall surely be put to death natural death I'm talking about Soul separated from the body usually it was by stoning which was very horrible cuz it wasn't a quick death Proverbs 14:1 The House of the wicked shall be overthrown but the Tabernacle of the up upright that us the Tabernacle of the upright shall flourish there is a way which seeth right unto man everybody that goes to church today wherever Church they're going to thinks they're right thinks they sitting in the right place they they everything's cool and we're good and XYZ well we're fine but the end thereof are the ways of death and listen folks you ain't got to sit in a Baptist Church to die you can sit in a message church and die you can actually die quicker because there's the death by Death everybody with me put you to death by the death that comes inside of you but now we got here now we're over into the New Testament and Jesus tells us if a man keeps my saying he shall never see death and then the Jews said now we know you got a devil you're speaking really something we don't understand Abraham is dead and the prophets and thou sayest if a man keep my sayings he shall never taste of death what was Jesus telling them die here get born again here you get born again here you'll never see the second death amen that's the one you better worry about now Paul walks up and he says look I persecuted this way unto the death he caused people to blaspheme he caused people to die by what he said now listen you talk about Grace cuz if he would have been under the law well he was under the law but look what he done to the law he perverted it turned it around cuz remember he said one time he said what I thought was life is now death amen all right what I thought was life the light in me that I thought was light has now become Darkness cuz in Romans 6:8 said now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion over him listen death the separation of soul and body should have no dominion over you but we still do I mean who of you today would say okay if I got to die I'll die right now nobody's going to do that right but you ought to be able to you ought to be able to not scar be not scared of it right right if you are then let's go back to the believing let's go back and read the quotes in the scripture back over here that you need to start believing that what you got is going to be greater than death for in that he died he died under sin once but in that he liveth he liveth under God likewise now he's talking about us now likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead indeed under sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord that's the alive we want to see and that's the dead we want to see we want to be dead Christians dead and Christians let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lust thereof neither yield you your members as instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin but yield yourself unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God for sin shall not have dominion over you who believes that if you look at job job was not a bride he wasn't bride material right that's right he didn't have a new birth in his soul right but God said okay Satan you do whatever you want to do but don't touch his soul his soul stays in his body you can do whatever you want to to his body but you can't you can't kill it right but go ahead and you see what happened I think Satan still scratching his head just over job for sin shall not have dominion over you for you are not under under the law now look under the law you're now under grace What then shall we sin because we are not under the law now that's what I said before there is no Greece in Grace no Greece none at all but grace is sufficient there is a thing called Grace or it wouldn't be here several hundred times and brother B wouldn't say that my whole makeup is Grace What then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace in other words the law says you got to go to church or you die well under grace you still got to come to church but they're not going to take you out and kill you you're going to die spiritually anyway if you don't start if you don't come to church I'm going to amen that anyway because it's the truth know you not that to whom you yield yourself servants to obey his servants ye are to whom you obey whether of sin under death or of obedience under righteousness Romans 6 verse 21 say what fruit had ye then in those things where you now ashamed for the end of those things is death in other words what's fruitful to you now that if you like to go to the Beer Joint if you like to go to the the different things in the world what fruit is that that you should be ashamed of that you should be ashamed of those things you did and we are ashamed for the end of those things is death but now being made free from sin and become servants to God you have your fruit under Holiness and the end everlasting life for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord and we know that sin is not smoking drinking cussing sin is unbelief it's it's go back over here you got to start believing believe who you are you say well I don't feel it now I nobody said a word about you feeling it but now remember if you take a stand right here your works is going to produce what you're standing on all right your works is going to produce it you can't go off somewhere like he said he said can we now this is what Paul's saying Paul's saying well now you're telling us we're not under the law so we can sin anytime we want to that's what he was saying he said God forbid God forbid you can't do that that's your whole totally terrible attitude you can't do that you got to come under righteousness and as Bob said you you got to have a conscience now your conscious listen I want to tell you something real quick I'm going to stop right here we'll get to it next week I've been to a couple of battlefields um never been to get his bird but you go to these battlefields now you come on in different ones it's so pristine it's so beautiful you can see the bull works or you can see the trenches that they trenched out and the little bitty cannons them ain't real the little bitty cannons and you can listen to the guy tell you that so and so was over here if you want to know ask George Quinn he'll tell you everything about the Civil War they'll tell you ever where they were supposed to be or should have been or was way more than I ever knew about it but you can see all that and it looks so pretty right they've got the grass growing up and they've got it you know at Gettysburg they say they got all the monuments and they got the hedges around it and they got everything trimmed up that's not the way it looked no at one point in time there were holes in that ground at one point in time there was men's guts on that ground there was men's blood there was awful cannons and there was awful guns and when the battle was over if you look at some of the pictures the trees where they shot so many cannons the trees have fell over they broken limbs look on look online and you'll see after the battle look what's going on well that's the way I want us to be I don't want to us to see the pristine part yet though because remember brother R told us he said that the greatest battle ever been fought is in your mind is Satan bombarding you with his doctrines God is still bombarding you with his cuz it's a Battleground it was two opposing forces everywhere there's a Battleground it wasn't Confederate fighting Confederate or or or Americans F or you know North fighting to North it was two opposing ideas came together to one place and didn't make it pretty right they made it ugly I I can't remember there was uh 20,000 men di to get hisb or something it was a huge amount talk about people just laying dead in all forms of deadness you know understand what I mean but see that was a battlefield that's what I want I don't want us to see we going to get to pretin part we're going to get the part to where say hey that was a battle that was a battle when on right here but look I've overcome I won that battle and now I'm standing on my ground I'm standing in a pristine place that's beautiful it's called Christianity it's called going to heaven but the greatest battle ever fought is ugly it's in your mind right now some are saying shut up some are saying keep going believe it will but we don't want to be caught up in look what was on that Battlefield life at first it was but when it was over the only thing left lay on the ground was dead men dead horses amen after that battle was over there was just nothing but AG laying in those fields that death is a separation of the soul and the body all right but what about your Battlefield what's dying in you right what you going to leave on the battlefield today what are you going to leave out there I hope you leave the defeated one and become the ones that take over the field and it's only by Jesus Christ because if you're not now you take these an analogy here death by death so if you take some of those soldiers that are just they were ranked Sinners they died two deaths that day they died naturally and then they didn't die die spiritually their Spirit went over into or soul went over in another place and it's going to have to die that's the second death but you got a group of people like brother R talks about uh Stonewall Jackson and different ones that were true Christian men they died that day he didn't die get hisb but he actually got shot by one of his own men but he died and if he was a Christian he only died one time so what we see is defeat was his victory that's what I want to tell you and I today you look at your Battlefield look at what you're fighting because it is a battle everything we do is a battle if it's not a battle it's like I was telling them in Ohio chief how you doing today Chief who said that Ellie hey baby Chief and they have at their Church they have a figurine of a white dog and a black dog but when but when Chief was not born again cuz remember Chief said after I got saved after I got saved in me now is white dog black dog all right because at first it was just black dog amen till you get born again it's Blackness it's death by death you're dying and you're still alive but once you get born again again there's a we don't want to call God a dog but brother Brown did he said now there's two dogs in me a white one which has got to be the Holy Ghost and then that black one is still there the battlefield is still still there he said well Chief which one wins he said the one I feed the most let's stand to our feet the one I feed the most listen let's let do like brother Ernie said let's hack them smack them kill them drill them and if we lose our teeth we'll gum the devil till he dies but it's a battle that battle in that church at Fourth Church age that battle was to stay alive physically but they were alive spiritually by the word of God that they held in their heart then we'll see the sardian church age we didn't get to it we'll get to it next week where they were called The Escape ones that's what Sardis means the Escape ones they escaped out of that and Luther came out of that all right he came out of that but remember when he came out he came out as a reformer we do not and cannot listen we cannot stay in Reformation you will always fall back in this age you go fall backwards you got to be full restoration which means restore the dead you back to life then you can be alive though you may be laying on your physical deathbed you are more alive than you have ever been in your entire life if you're born again and you're getting ready to step over into another dimension where you're not going to carry all that junk with you that's to me you just just lay that on the table that's just Christianity to me you got life after death and it's Eternal see it was a great thing when Lazarus was called that back out of the dead right Jesus said come forth Lazarus now remember probably 30 or 40 years after that Lazarus died again but I believe I hope that he was born again I hope he stayed and went to Pentecost or or or was one of the 500 I hope he was around because you know he was kind of attached to the to the maker you know and um he didn't have to die again though in his soul he's still alive we'll see him I will'll see Lazarus what a blessing it'll be when his face I'll see you love the Lord these people died to give us what we got as I told y'all before we'll talk about later on tendale brought us a Bible and they hated him so bad they drugged him through a street and killed him just for putting the just for doing this putting this together and giving the people some knowledge that's what when when they come out of that Catholic Church that Catholic Church was like no no no no no no uhuh you're not teaching these people this that was the battle and then when Luther stood out I believe God protected Luther because Luther said hey the just shall live by faith we don't have to do that I'm G to put my 95 thesis up and he did exactly what God said he said he came out of her my people and he brought a group of people with him have have you been brought completely out have you been reformed are we just reformed or have we been restored let's sing a song God bless [Music] you am we me through when life is pressing me I have a SW of power from above why I'm covered over by a shield of love [Music] I claim the blood Jesus shed on calary all that Battlefield may look messy but all To the victor the Victor gets the spoil for me for all my sin my sickness and my pain when I need healing I
