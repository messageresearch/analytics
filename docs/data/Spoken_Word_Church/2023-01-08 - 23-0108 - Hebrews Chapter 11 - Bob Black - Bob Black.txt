========================================

foreign could be in the house of the Lord this morning we've been studying through Hebrews and we made it to um if you remember last time we were talking about um verse 25 of chapter 10 not forsaking the assembling by ourselves together so we'll just kind of pick up there and keep moving on and uh and and I think we'll find ourselves in Hebrews 11 this morning oh God we're so grateful to be able to gather together around your word this morning we just ask that you'll just bless our study but open up these passages of scripture to us Lord that you'll give us the understanding of the essence of what each of these things mean be with us today we pray in your name amen so in verse 24 it says let us consider y'all y'all forgive my voice a little bit it's like real deep because I've been struggling with a cold or something um uh so it sounds scary I don't like to sound scary but uh anyway it is what it is and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good work so Paul's telling us we need to provoke provoke one another we're constantly provoking one another to keep to keep marching on and do better and and to love one another and to do good things and and one of those things of course is verse 25 not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the day approaching I think last time we pretty much laid it thank you thank you brother Josh I always forget to do the that's weird I don't know I forget that sometimes I'm getting older I guess y'all wasn't supposed to laugh at that that's not funny not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the day approaching so certainly is the more we see the signs of the times and the word being fulfilled the more that that should encouraged us to get to to fill it to Fellowship together and get together and more and want to hear the word more and all those kind of things so I was saying the last time we laid a pretty good foundation down of what uh the importance of coming to church and of course now on the flip side you know uh you know we lay it on the congregation you need to be at church but on the other other hand you know if if you if we're putting the word out there it that there's a promise in the Bible that where the carcass is the Eagles will be gathered together the Eagles are going to come to the word oh and so uh you know we it's it's it's it behooves us as ministers to to lay before the Lord and pray and seek God for his will and and study um uh and and just like like the brother will say in the Sunday lay in his word and and just constantly be meditating in it uh like the like the early disciples were doing the verse 26 says for if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth and no more sacrifices for sins and after you've received after we've received the knowledge of the truth a few if you if you just kind of if you disregard that God gave us a sacrifice for sins and if we go around that and say well I don't want that that that's the only sacrifice for sins you're going to get there's not another sacrifice for sins so that's that's that's it and so if you cast that aside uh you're casting the side the only hope that God has given to us the only thing that remains for you Paul's saying is a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall Devour the adversaries and that kind of goes along with what John the Baptist preached that that if you don't bear forth fruit then you're going to be cast Into the Fire any any plant we're all like plants that are growing up but if you don't bear forth fruit eventually going to be casting the fire that's the warning of Malachi 4 that before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord before the atomic bombs fall before fire falls and for judgment Falls that God's going to give us a a chance to a chance to accept Christ uh if you if you disregard that that sacrifice that God made for us though then that's that's what awaits and so in verse 26 28 Paul saying he that despised Moses law died without Mercy under two or three Witnesses of how much sore punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden underfoot the Son of God and hath counted the blood of the Covenant where if he was wherewith he was Sanctified an Unholy thing and if done despite unto the spirit of Grace so if you died under without Mercy under two or three Witnesses in the time of Mercy then surely under this day when God has just poured out so much grace and mercy and and died on the cross for us how much more would how much more worthy of punishment would be we'd be worthy of if we would try that grace and mercy that God has given unto us under our feet like that little picture I've got of you stepping on somebody stepping on something what a horrible thing I'm kind of I'm kind of moving fast throughout through some of these scriptures to get so I can get to Faith because Paul is just kind of reiterating a few things that he said in the past he said for we know him that has said Vengeance belongeth unto me I will recommend saith the Lord and again the Lord shall judge his people it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God but call to remembers the former days in which after you were illuminated ye endured a great fight of afflictions partly once you were made of gazing stock both by reproaches and afflictions and partly well she became Companions of them that were so used for he had compassion of me and my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance cast not a way therefore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward for ye have need of patience that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise I just love how encouraging Paul's statements are he's constantly trying to build up our faith to look what the promise is that you're you're you're you're working toward you don't give up just keep keep pressing the battle because he's saying for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not take carry now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him I got a picture of a little uh a daisy or some kind of a flower growing up because that's that's what you when a seed is planted it grows and it grows and grows until eventually it's going to come it's going to reproduce exactly the same thing that was planted again so Paul's saying now now it's been planted and you don't draw back you just keep pressing on and eventually you're going to see the you're going to see the fruits of what was planted in your heart eventually you're gonna there's you're gonna see that promise of of a body change of of of the fruits being working working and you remember all these things that that he's speaking of for we are not of them who draw back under Perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the Soul and so in that verse in Hebrews 11 it says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen now we are them that believe I believe in is is everything a Christian knows how to do we believe and now brother Brown said any questions and answers she said now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things you did not see taste feel smell and hear but by faith when he catches the word it sends him into a dimension that makes it so real to him until it's just as good as he got it in his hand he knows it's going to happen and improving his word he said faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence not seeing taste felt smell or heard you believe it and Faith now now here's maybe the point I want to make this morning as we kind of study this out Faith must have a resting place and anything that's contrary to the word of God faith in God can have no resting place until it's a promise of God and there it takes its Eternal stand and the message persevered and he said he said I was in a I spoke at a Kiwanis Club some time ago and there was a doctor told me that said oh I believe Billy I was talking about a certain patient he'd get up and the Lord healed he said oh I believe in faith and I said now wait a minute what kind of Faith you talking about he said just the faith I believe if that man would walk out here and put his hand on the tree and believe he was going to get well he'd get well just the same as what someone had prayed for him now now see how how some people believe in fight you the point is you've got to have something that you base your faith in you can't just go out and like sit under a tree and hope something pops into your head you got to have that your faith is based on something I said now who tell me doctor you're an intelligent looking man how could a man ever have faith by putting his hand on a tree you would make him well you gotta have faith in something and the Bible said Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God that bases it your faith has got a foundation because God promised it right so then and that's in Romans chapter 10 so if Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God maybe maybe we could ask that question this morning what's your faith based on when we read these words of Paul why do we believe Paul are these when we when you really read any word in the Bible uh you know these these men Paul wrote these words down as Paul Paul's words why do we count what was special about this it's because of the character of God backs it up God inspired these words and these are not just a man's words but God God spoke these inspired these words to be written and spoken by Paul you you see the point that you got to base any anything that you believe has got to be based in something and so we're basing our faith in the words of not just a man but we're basing our faith in the words of God and it's backed up by his character and his integrity and his honesty and all those attributes that make up who God is and that's what we have comfort us in brother Adam said no watch the order of the word and you shall receive it shall have it first you believe you've got it then it'll be given to you and when you come make your confession believe God believe that he will do it and he's under obligation to do it God is worth no more than his word is no man is worth any more than his word is and God is infallible he cannot lie his word is true and we just accept him by his word and believe it it's got to happen and I so this morning I I believe maybe that this will build our faith if we can just really accept that God is not a liar that God is not going to make fun of you if you believe his word that there's not a trap laying there for you if you believe his word there's not something bad going to happen but the things that are written in the God's word are true and you can base everything on everything that God said in John chapter 8 he said ye are of your father the devil and the lust of your father he will do talking to the Pharisees and the sadduce you standing out there he said he was a murderer from from the beginning and Abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it and because I tell you the truth you believe me not he's telling you the truth in Proverbs chapter 3 he said trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding in second Corinthians he said that God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which is blessed forevermore knoweth that I lie not that's Paul speaking and in first Timothy it says where unto Paul's to Paul's instructing Timothy on how to preach to preach the gospel and how to be a minister and how to how to be a good Christian he said where unto I am ordained a preacher and an apostle I speak the truth in Christ and lie not a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and Verity oh you you see what what an interesting thing that God has his with it he's got that his character of who he is is backing up his word and then when you become a Believer he's he's kind of transposing that down to you that what other people are now going to be looking at you to see to pursue an influence of what this message is and so we also have a mandate to conduct ourselves with integrity and honesty and to not lie to one another and to be truthful because people are looking at you to see what this gospel really is and that's what Paul's getting at he's saying I'm not telling you I'm not coming to you with fables and I'm not coming to you with tricks and flattery and things I'm telling you the truth and I'm telling you the truth so you'll believe me because the things that I'm you know what a minister is a minister is a peddler of Truth a minister is a peddler that's a merchandise our merchandise is the truth and like like Jesus he goes standing there in front of pilot and he said and Paula said what is truth and truth was standing there right in front of him and he didn't recognize it that's what in Ephesians chapter 4 he says speaking but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even crossed so Paul was telling us and if you go back to what Ephesians chapter 4 is this talking about that God gave a gift of the fivefold ministry to bring you up into the fullness of the stature of a perfect man of that of that stature and that's what he's talking about to do that we've got to speak it in Truth and speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head in Christ I was reading this at the time I speak in the truth in love that brother Brian said the truth it's got to be spoke the truth has got to be spoken but if you don't mix it with love then you'll lose your influence with the people that's interesting isn't it the angel of God he said the hardest thing that God has ever had to do is to get one mortal to believe another and an influence he said and if we take the testimony of being Christians I think that is one of the most solemn things that a man or a woman boy or girl could do would when he takes on the name of Christ that he is going to be a representative of Christ you should watch every move you make because somebody is watching you why should we watch every move we make every word that we make be careful about things because we want to be influenced to others and what Christianity really is because I want people to believe God that's why we should be so careful about the way that we Act and the way that we do because I want people I want to lead people to Christ that's what that's what that message influence is about that we're not interested in popularity but we're interested in being a Christian influence popularity is when somebody Pat you on the back and says good job but influence is when somebody looks at your life says I want to be a Christian because I'm looking at that person and that I I want what that person has when they can see something genuine in first Thessalonians Paul said but as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel even so we speak not as pleasing men but God which trieth our hearts for neither at any time usually flattering words as you know nor a cloak of covetousness God is witness and if you keep going down Paul said ye are witnesses and God also how holy and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe that my goodness to think about that that is a mandate that every Christian has to behave themselves like that holy and justly and unblameably where somebody can look at you and see the Life of Christ so manifest in you to know that you're not a liar that you're not an adulterer that God has changed so that you're living and doing just like Christ because your goal your mandate is to live a life that will lead others to Christ in Proverbs chapter 10 he said the lips of the righteous know what is acceptable it could not be our confession this morning that you know what's acceptable what you should say and what you shouldn't say what music you should listen to and what you shouldn't listen to what you should do and where you should go the lips of the righteous know what is acceptable but the mouth that the wicked speaketh fruitness in Psalm chapter 34 it says keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips from speaking God in Proverbs Chapter 12 it says lying lips are an Abomination to the Lord but they that deal truly are his Delight Colossians 3 9 says lie not one to another seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds in Proverbs 11 says the Integrity of the upright shall guide them but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them and brothers said in the prayer line he said now you believe I'm trying to you see how brother Brown I'm gonna read some quotes where he's he's trying to get people to believe him to be an influence to people people and he said now you believe I'm trying with all my heart to help you trying to do everything I know how to do to help you I am a Christian friend I am your brother and I love you with the dearest of Christian love I do that with all my heart God forbid that I'd ever be a deceiver I'd rather go go on home right now to Glory then and take my reward there than to try to be here to try to be a deceiver or to do something that was wrong oh no friend I'm your brother and I'm telling you the truth uh you you see how your faith has got to be based on something and how how much our faith should increase to know that Paul was telling us the truth that William Branham was telling us the truth that when a man stands up behind this Pulpit he's just not just standing up here to play but to tell you the truth to give you something that you can base your salvation on at your whole heart your whole life on tell you something that'll change your life and change your family he said I'm telling you the truth as my heart before God if I found Grace in your sight you believe me tonight as God's Prophet as far as the Divine gift that's the truth here lays the Bible it's over my heart with all my heart that's the truth see that's the truth it's a Divine gift that was given to be unmerited I had nothing to do with it it come by God's Sovereign Grace when I was born I had it all my life gifts and callings are without repentance and brother Brown said in the total in a Deliverance he said just to kind of lay before you how much truth matters how much the things that we do in life matters because people are looking at us he said I just had to do that I know that I did wrong I lied because my wife this is the story about how the the IRS agent and called and and he he stepped outside on the porch and told his wife just tell him I'm not here I think it was his lawyer anyway whoever it was it called and he said I lied I caused my wife to lie I believe I told you about it here at the churches a few days not long ago it's been about six weeks ago the attorneys had me so tore up over this investigation until I hardly knew where I was at I just went home from the office to eat dinner and the private phone number rang and Mita went to answer the phone she put her hand over it said it's them attorneys again I said I couldn't stand another evening my head feels like it's going off I'm losing my mind just pulling me this way that way and this way I said I can't stand it and I jumped up and I said tell them I'm not in here and I run around behind the house when I come back meat is very conscientious of those things she met me at the door half crying she said bill was that the right thing to do maybe let's let's let that prick us a little bit this morning see how it seemed like just a little simple little thing but he was he was there in the house and he just told her just I'm going to step outside and you tell them I'm not here but he was there meat is very conscious instead of so he said you know how you are I know how I am I said sure I wasn't in here right then I knew God had condemned me for it I said I wasn't in there right then said but you was in here when he made the call and then he said that afternoon I went to pray for a sick baby and before I left the house the phone rang again and little Joseph run over and took a hold of the phone and said Daddy you want me to tell him you ain't here you see how sin corrupts what a family that would finally be then I started to pray for this baby and when I started to lay my hands on it the Lord rebuked me and said you told a lie and you ain't fit to pray for that baby because less people are on why why would he why was he not fit to pray for that baby because he's a peddler of Truth truth you can't mix truth and a lie in a mouth of a crit of a of a minister of a Christian you can't mix it up and because people are people are watching you people are watching you to see what you're going to do and how do you act they were watching him his little boy was watching him to see see whether he was going to mix truth and a lie and and as soon as he started mixing it up his daddy wanted to be like him because people are watching you people are watching your kids are watching everything that you do your church is watching everything that you do people want to see a real genuine influence something something genuinely reflected that that famous spanish author Miguel de cervante said an honest man's word is as good as his bond and Jesus said in Matthew Chapter 5 he said again you have heard that it has been said by them of old time Thou shalt not forswear thyself but shall perform unto the Lord thine Oaths but I say unto you swear not at all neither by heaven for it is God's Throne known by the Earth for his footstool neither by Jerusalem for it is the great king neither shalt that swear by thy head because thou cast not make one hair white or black but let your communication be what yay or nay nay you tell the truth you say yeah I'm going to do it or no I'm not you let your conversation be well what does what good does it do if you've got the footstool and the Jerusalem and and heaven and everything all stacked up like something that you can place your hand on and make make an oath on if you're still going to tell a lie you just tell the truth let your conversation be true whatever is more of these cometh and evil in Proverbs chapter 26 I really like this proverb like a madman who throws firebrands arrows and death is the man who deceives his neighbor and says I was only joking like I'm it's like a madman to go around and say and making statements and saying things and stuff and then just follow oh I was only kidding why because people want to hear the truth from you the truth from a real Christian believer because that's something that you can base your faith in right brother Adam said we should have confidence in one another we should have faith in one another we should have faith that if we hire somebody in the church and they come to do some work for us that they're going to do what they say that they they do we should have faith and confidence in one another if we if we buy a car or buy something from somebody that they're going to do what they say that they're going to do right brother and said and I will restore he said there come a man by the name of Peter they know he was a prophet old and ananias walked up before him one day and he said I sold this so and so and Peter said you're lying you ever wonder what that story of ananiasis the fire really was about when it got called out in the church it's a story of Integrity Integrity that when ananiasis and Sapphire came into the church they were holding back the truth of what they were really intending to do and Peter said you're lying is that right went right down with that Spirit of Christ upon him and said you kept back a portion of the money frighten the old boy so bad till he felt dead and they packed him out here come his wife in Peter said you're into it too in a way they packed her and what is integrity Integrity implies trustworthiness and incorruptability to a degree that one is incapable of being false to a trust responsibility or pledge you see what my point this morning that we've got to have faith in something and that faith that our faith is based on confidence in the word of God that God and His Integrity the one that spoke the word is going to back it up if he said it you know that's what knowledge is to know that if God said it he's going to back it up if God said it he's able to bring it to pass and we're right here at the time so we'll stop right there and God bless you God is able to fulfill his word foreign [Applause] [Applause]
