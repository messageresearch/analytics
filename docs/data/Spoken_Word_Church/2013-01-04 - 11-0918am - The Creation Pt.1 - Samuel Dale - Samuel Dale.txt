we calculated somewhere between 25 and 30 of us so we had a good turnout and out of about probably 100 people we had we had a good turnout really had a good time enjoyed it and always enjoy fellowshipping uh one with the other so just remember these remember all sick among us and pray that the Lord would touch each one yes and bless each one because that's what we're here for and we thank the Lord for all things Remember Me this coming Tuesday they put me back on the list now I want to whack this your little old thing out they call it uh Gorder or aroid and I'm going to go find out why he wants to do what and if he don't talk my language we're going to keep the thing till we have some other need but we just leave everything in the hands of the Lord cuz I'm not worried about it neither way it doesn't bother me I'm just I've always just been made that way so I live one day at the time I do I live one day at a time I look forward to Future things but I live one day at a time cuz that way I can just take care of everything and not have to worry about it amen I get up every day and I say thank you Lord for giving me another day I lay down at night I say thank you Lord have a good day y got all I could do or plan to do for myself and now we'll just uh go to sleep wake up in the morning get started on something else amen we appreciate remember all the announcements now the Lord willing that brother Reed will be here with us on the 2nd of October and just be here for the Sunday services with us all and brother fory will be here is it the 12th all right 10 11 12

I know you did here I got to to view the services and the things and pray that the Lord would would bless remember those that are on the way back home from the the youth camp and the things that the Lord would would be with each one amen and any other announcements I generally forget something I'll be in witch next weekend right Lord willing Wade will be in witch next weekend couple of weekends later it'll be brother Richards so just remember that and keep everything in you might anything else there is an announcement down there in the stairway going down about a shower so remember that just read it as you go out and you know you don't have to go do do a lot of shopping cuz you can just go get a card from Walmart or Target orever what it is and everything then when when Mary and in the future gets out there they can buy what you want to so that's you know that's the easiest way to handle anything all right Genesis 1 oh two we will be having a fall festival uh you know like we did last year so whenever we can get that planed to where it it can be we'll be on having the chicken house on Saturday and we talked about it yesterday Danny maybe we can we got enough fish I think or if we don't we'll we'll U buy some right but you know we'll probably that we that thing how the fish fry along with the Fall Festival you know out in the evening and that would work out to be all together a good time and and you can you know eat the fish and enjoy it so that'll be a good time so remember these amen father we thank you we love you and we ask you that just bless each and every one of us with your presence you said you sent your word and healed us so we believe it we just depend upon you we put our dependence not upon anything else but we depend upon solely what you have to say we confess your word by your stripes we are healed and we walk forward Lord we ask you to just dismiss from us anything that would be a hindrance whatsoever and just let your light shine in our hearts and lives forgive our sins because we want to stand complete in you and just lead us and let your light shine in Jesus name amen Genesis 1 and remember we've been bu in heaven now for quite a while all right so we coming down all right so we're on the horizontal rainbow you know the old brother preached and coming down to the Earth we still got a little bit this morning to jump back up but we've got to we're coming down to into life upon the Earth in what we're trying to study okay so in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called a light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day all right now while we're at it jump over to verse 16 and you'll find that it was two lights made amen the Sun and the Moon all right and God made two great lights the greater light to Rule the Day and the Lesser light to rule the night and he made the Stars also so you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now I would love to I done this one time years ago but we don't have the time now to do it but I'd love to take each day and the creation and the the things and you know and emphasize on it and uh you know be able ble to uh to talk a little bit about it because I believe that what God done is through his creation he was revealing himself right amen putting himself down into words first which would be creation and we'll talk about it in a minute where the Prophet said that he made the stars and things he was writing his first Bible right and he was doing those things and and as he was doing it then it's it's wonderful to look at each day and see but the main thing I want you to remember is that to tie back into the previous services that remember brother R said the first thing God created was angels and they worshiped him all right then we know that the world was formed cuz we read there in Genesis 1 and uh you know and it was with it was without form and void darkness and Etc and that's the reason I like it because if you notice the reading of the Scriptures it really in the Bible I don't mean this the Lord knows it but it looks like God does everything backwards you know because it's just the way he does it and you know over in there where Jacob laid down and he was dreaming a dream it says the Angels were ascending and descending well it looked like they ought have been you know descending and ascending but no see right they was down there with him amen all right and they were taking up his prayers and bring it back down the rewards you know so then God the way he does things is really odd but uh I'm glad to have little back back her with us today and she got her a job she can mail us an onion a piece from V but you know I'm glad of that glad she got her job Amen Let me see it but see then we read here in Genesis and it says like the first day and and it says the evening and the morning right right was the first day then the next one is the creation and they say the evening and the morning mhm well that's kind of backward the way we look at things right know we look at things is the morning you know and the evening but it's kind of odd the way God does it but how beautiful it is because if the world was without form and void and then he starts to do something then that would be the evening the darkness you know the evening time as we would be looking at it and and I like that because it comes all the way over to where we're at and uh in the evening time it shall be light then in the morning you'll be a resurrection right all right so I like it that way but just you know you keep those things in mind as we go along that's why I'd like to just preach on each thing but you know we want to get into something this morning that we were looking at as I said the prophet said the first thing that was made was Angel and then he begin to create and to bring into being like the world and he said then there it says in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth period he said then he could have let it lay for billions of billions of trillions of years before he ever done anything see because that's not the first day right right the Earth was created in things because that wasn't the first day you see you got to divide if you read your scripture that you'll see that it comes over in the face of the deep the different things God was moving upon it and then he said let there be light and there was light right now you're getting to the first day cuz see if you tie it too close together then you'll cross up what brother randam is saying when he would say that see it says in the beginning God created heaven and earth period he that's where science don't understand and and even if you try to tie those things together you're going to bring it in to a day but just remember your start your days which we know and we can go in you know that the day is a th years 1 th years is a day with the Lord but still get the point that the world was there every this thing was doing was going on in what we would call the universe and as it was then he would start to create so that's what we're going to talk about for probably this morning this afternoon is the creation all right and in doing that brother random never denied some of what science has to say right he accepted it because they could prove it you know in in everything and I wish said a couple of messages if you want to more or less follow along what I'm saying about it get the message of uh cruelty of sin preached in 1953 uh 403 and and listen to that message and then go over to uh 1953 729 which would be like questions and answers on Genesis all right then you'll hear what is being said okay and in doing that see I didn't choose to bring those things but I just chose to to uh mention them to you and then we will get to a point in just a moment but see science says there was a Big Bang Theory science says that it was and I don't understand how they got to gas this together cuz I'm not a scientist I'm not to do it but they say that it was just like a massive like the sun was just a great thing and the then all at once you had explosions etc etc and from there came the planets and the stars and I never could understand what a planet meant and what a star meant you know one's supposed to be one thing one's supposed to be another one uh one them supposed to have the capability of Life the other one's not supposed to be I remember all that from school but I I I'm not concerned to whether you call them stars or planets or we look out we see the stars falling we see and we say look at the stars well it's impossible because Stars don't fall if they fail it would mess up the whole universe but still the point of what I'm want you to see is that science says there's a big bang theory that it was all gases and then it begin to just out and you know and start uh doing things and and all of this universe that we're living in that it's a massive uh Universe of things and uh as it would go out then the stars begin to develop the the different things but now I want you to remember one thing and brother random doesn't deny science he brings it to a point of understanding science that's right amen because you see we have in our solar system of where we are and I'm not a scientist I'm just making this point to get you to see what God how marvelous he can make things all right in our solar system as we call it like where we are see we have a sun of our own right we have a moon of our own well many many planets out there have some of them have many moons you know some of those planets I mean they can prove that they've got Suns of their own they got Moon of star you know things that in their atmosphere or in their uh Universe would be a way of saying it which means it's in a a form but now remember the messages behind this that we tried to bring that we live in in a in a thing that we call a dimension right and remember a dimension is a uh an area as defined maybe large small whatever this building is talked about is like a a dimension a cubicle or whatever you want to make it but just think about it because I didn't have time and all the others to bring see that all of this universe that's going out and all these stars and moons and and planets and whatever you want to call them that they can look out there hundreds of billions of billions of billions of light years and find more planets amen just remember the one thing that I tried to bring that we live in Dimensions we live in a fact of light life and matter whatever you want to say time then there's a fourth fifth sixth seventh Dimension all right now so then if we are in an atmosphere of Worlds out that's still a dimension no matter how big it is right no matter how vast it is it's a dimension and remember Heaven is not a dimension that's right you remember that right I told told you these will be imported as we go along Heaven is not a dimension because you can't put a you can't calculate it there's no way to put it into a cubicle right you can't make it into a square round or whatever it is so just keep that in mind that that's why science can't find those things cuz they can only see in the dimensions that we're living in Connected To Life Light matter from here and they can see all this vast universe that's out out there but they can't find Heaven you remember the Russian went up came back and said went all the way up to the moon and back but said found no God found no Heaven found nothing like that we see because we're Limited in a dimension right amen so think about the the worlds and all the planets now with me for just a minute is that still a dimension right no matter how vast it would be no matter how far it could go and they say that it's still even going and and and that we're actually moving right that we're not standing still but we're going to drop back to the Bible one day about it and see that why that heaven comes to you know why the future home comes down on this earth right because I believe this is the only one that has life amen you can believe other planets have life you do what you want to but I don't believe in it amen I don't believe in extraterrestrial being we got enough monkeys down here that's right we got enough problems on this Earth why don't we worry about something up in there right you know well one of these days one of them drop down pick you up brother D you'll change your mind well I say hey buddy where'd you come from New York we was over in Israel and uh this fell was supposed to make a speech and I mean he got up there there going to tell us something we fixing to do why he was as North Carolina hillbilly as you ever heard in your life and he was a Jew I said where in the world you live he said North Carolina I said no wonder you know know if they pick me up I say Hey Joe where you from you know what's going on there but you know I ain't worried about it I'm concerned about this planet because I've always told you the Bible says Eve is the mother of all living so that solves it for me all right well you're just too stubborn well that's all right maybe I am but you know God loves stubborn people sometimes but now get on back to what we're talking about all of this universe no matter how bask it could be it's a dimension right sure see and and if it was possible and and if we stayed around here another 50 years you would see interplanetary travels you would see going from here to Venus or Mars or something and you know they just learn back because you know of the great advancement of science right and all like that but still remember you'd be bound to a dimension right yeah you would be like the movie they made of Lost in Space where they couldn't get back you know and and the things you would be into those forms but yet you would still be limited right because science says you know Einstein said if you went out so far and went so fast you could go out and be gone 50 years come back you wouldn't be a bit older well now he can convince you of that yeah but he can't convince me of that cuz I might not be no older on the clock how many have you ever been out on a boat and come back to land how many of you ever been in a plane and had jet lag right and problems oh yeah you got fun if you ain't never been out on a boat and been out there about 24 hours or 12 or 15 hours come back in and maybe 2 or 3 hours later you walk in around about that time you lag cuz everything starts just going like that you know not making light just talking but see remember now my point because that was what I was trying to get over there that no matter how far we could go out into space we could never reach heaven right right it's not another dimension it is so Superior to this dimension until there's no way to even hardly talk about that's right but you say well now you know that's still on with you that's right I still ain't through what I was talking about but the point I want you to get was that the while in heaven God created the Angels MH then he created a world you know an atmosphere life of doings so science where their big bang theories is not too far off and all like that but remember now see I'm saying that to where somebody hears it they would not life at us as idiots we're dumb enough as it is don't worry about it pray for us but brother randam knew of the other world having Moons and stars and things you can read science that can tell you but yet his dealings was right here because this is where God is going to come back to right is to this world this point doings right here all right so then as we talk about it just think about what your Prophet knew and yet science wouldn't accept what he had to say about it but you know just think on it now from the message while we are not a denomination I want I chose to read basically this whole thing so if uh you'll pull it up while we are not of denominations 1958 927 paragraph 240 so just look at it and listen to what your Prophet knew now as I said before we start reading all right before we start off our reading remember the point I just made he drops down dealing with just the existence in this uh what do you call it in our what was the word I used one ago in our world our system Galaxy our galaxy all right the all right in this he's dealing just with that he's not dealing a lot of times with the big point but you got to remember it evidently must have been a Big Bang Theory right there must have been the masses of gases and things because you hear him telling about God writing his his Bible all right now writing his Bible is the whole universe right now he drops back more or less to the Earthly form to bringing it into our place all right now I want I want to you to see that because you know that way you won't get tied up into the two so just remember there had to be as we'll we'll get to it the prophet said said the clinkers blew off said what's he doing on those two messages gave he said he's writing his Bible well that's all up in the atmosphere that's that's not just what's in our circular with our moon and our sun that's dealing on out all right but then he's dropping back because there's really no need of dealing out there it's dealing here cuz here's were and you can say what you want to this is the center of the universe right amen why is it the center of the universe Brother D because we know it's not the center position no it's the center of the universe because it's where God chose righten to bring into view what he wanted amen all right so that's why it's going to come back here all right now listen but when he was back Yonder before the foundation of the world before he took his old son and he moved it around this whole star that we're living on now this Earth he molded over here by the Sun and he laid it around the Sun saying here's the sun he molded it on this side and let her hang there for 100 billion years what was he making some gases he moved around on the de side he made something else what was he making there some potato some Poes he moved around this way what was he doing here making some calcium what was he doing he was making you and me amen now our bodies was in the Earth right amen now it didn't say our bodies was on the moon right get my point that's what my whole thing was to explain all the other he didn't say our bodies was on Mars Jupiter y our bodies were here on this Earth amen cuz this is the whole center of the universe when we get to it all right what's he doing he's making you and me what was he doing like the contractor laying all his two was making you and me what was he doing like the contractor laying out all of his 2x4s and and 2 by8 he he sheeting his sighing he know just how many buildings he was going to build y we're made out of 16 elements of the earth and he was making us all and laying us out there before the world ever come into now watch he didn't mean before it ever come into existence he's saying before it ever come into what he was going to use it for CU watch and it might have been oblong at that time I don't know what it was what was he making gold and copper and BR and water and all those stuff for he's a contractor he's he he's a builder he was laying everything out there had everything cut and fashion when he got it all made it was just a great big volcanic eruption see now that's where your Mountain Rangers come from and we'll get on to the other part in just a minute he let them old volcanoes brewed out there for 100 100 million years to make some calcium what is it it's part of you he's building your body so we'll get back to that later okay but now on the messages that I ask you to read cruy of sin or questions and answers you find brother randam saying he said it was just a mass of gases and said he let it sling off and said what's he doing said he's writing his Bible said clinkers went off then he narrows it down to the reason I using that he narrows it down to this earth to this do we're living in this world this system this Dimension or whatever you want to call it see atmospheres and things uh and brother BR said he let it hang out there y now he says here are the volcanic eruptions Etc all things got to do and it begin to form into uh you know materialistic things we call it all right but then he tells you on the other ones that God let it go out so far he said then he stopped it right and he said it was then going through and science can prove it that this world went through at one time a thing called an ice age and he said he let it hang out there so far said it went through a nice age I IED over everything you know because of what was doing and uh you know then the r said he pulled it in closer to the Sun and he said begin to let it thaw out and he said then that's what you see formed of Texas like I've always said I look down in the Grand Canyon and you're looking down like that and you're looking down like that and you keep looking down and you realize it's miles down there and they say that little Old River run down through there and washed it out I never could agree with that you know I'm just I'm sorry but you take the ice a and the things and as the prophet said you'll hear him talking about it said forming Texas and the things he said then as the water begin to recede out so then you see the Seas the things coming into view and you know water begins to accumulate in certain places because he moved it into a certain orbit and stood it up perfectly and and as it did see then you see all of these big valleys and things that's where I believe Grand can come from I believe one of those great big chunks of ice melted up in there somewhere and as it go down through Mel it's just cutting the ground up and doing things and all like that that's that's nothing I'm just trying to get a point of a natural and then we'll get to this to something else the prophet said then dry ground begins to appear and he says then from that dry ground begins to form the beautiful trees you know I mean you look around the world and you see before man got to hold up start cutting out everything right and you see beautiful places amen just marvelous places I like to get back into the woods you know back where that there's not been too many people you know but then you're sitting out there looking around and you find a beer can you find all kind of things you realize somebody done been there and messed it up right but you just think of what America looked like when we came here and the things and the beauty of this country and and all like that and see God planted those seeds in the earth you say were the prophet said it was from another civilization what not another one like the doctrine of another world before this world and there people before more people created than Adam and Eve I don't believe in that cuz the Bible would say Eve is the mother of all living solves that to me all right now I'm trying to get down to just a point of looking at something and it was a beautiful place yep beautiful situation he begins to create as I said in this place that we're living He creates a moon he creates sun he creates all the things he creates all of the beauty you read the Genesis coming down to there and he creat creates the animals and everything's beautiful but there was still something wrong with the scene that was there right because God had within him attributes and being a Creator would be part of it right y but he had attributes in him to be a father yep by that time the Angels had displayed the fact of being you know God but he wanted to be a Healer he wanted to be a savior he wanted to be a redeemer and he realized something would have to take place to bring that into being and by that time Satan had already begin to start developing all right now then you come down to the last thing that was created on the sixth day and it was man all right now to me that's why the prophet spent so much time emphasizing the difference between Genesis 126 and 27 and Genesis 2 amen because Genesis 2 is the natural man that was created Adam upon the Earth right that was what was created on the sixth day right because the 126 man was not created on any day right amen that's right so we get over to 126 and 27 and we read and what does it say and God said let us make man in our in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them all right now as I said the creation of man was on the sixth day that was the natural human Adam right the man the 16 elements was brought together and formed a body but this 126 and 27 man what about him see I wasn't trying to show how smart I was with the Stars and whatever I was just trying to tie together the messages of what I previously preached down to this message because what kind of a man did God create amen and when did he create that man that he speaking of in 126 and 2 that's right we know when he created the natural man the sixth day right but when did he create this man and what kind of a man did he create so according to what we read here in the Bible that first he says let us make man brother brandom emphasizing that one day he says and I can give you these if you need them he said Father and Son MH oh we're trinitarians no we're not trinitarians he said Father and Son word and spirit right right the word is what created the world Jesus Christ created the world according to the Bible Hebrews 1 John 1 Colossians 1 James 3 and9 all things were created by Jesus Christ all right so who created the man of Genesis 2 Jesus Christ now not Jesus the flesh I have to say that because people run their minds in the wrong direction when I say Jesus Christ I am talking about almighty God Elohim self-existing word the offy whatever words you want logos speech whatever all of those words is talking about because I believe in one true and living God yes sir but I'm not a Oneness because I believe in a father Son and the Holy Ghost amen and this proves it here in Genesis not that it proves two personalities or person or identities it proves exactly what happened in the beginning that God stepped over into another form called the word Loos theop Son of God God in another form right stood there and begin to create all all right and as he begin to create see then it would be Father and Son in communication because the father would be totally in command that's where your people don't see what I'm talking about because you surely wouldn't want to believe that I'm a Oneness right right if you really seen what I try to bring because when I try to bring you know I don't bring all God was he poured into Christ and do away with God that's what they seem to do and I surely don't believe all Christ was he pours into the church and that does away with Christ I don't believe that I believe all God was he stepped over into another form and become the word the Christ right and then all Christ was Ste into another form called The Bride amen and that she's the final form form of God in this dispensational time the Jews get their dispensation but we're not concerned with them that's right all right see then that way we are the final form of God right well where would it be any trouble believing then that we would be made in the image of God Amen all right now here's the importance of the back messages see we studied and brought it out and emphasized over and over that God is real right amen that he's not like the wind the prophet said that's right he's a being he said he said he lives in a house anybody need these out there on the internet you just send us a note and we'll get them for you cuz Joe's got them right out there now where he can send them back to you probably before we get through with the service if you want God is a being the prophet said he's not like the wi that's right he said if he was like the wind you wouldn't have to seek the Holy Ghost because he would just be in everybody but he's a being he's a person he's real yeah now brother Dale God's a spirit what do you think a spirit is well it's just a spirit you know just just some nature some something you know has no form to it now where do you get that out of the Bible right I mean I want it in the Bible I want the prophet's message that's right where do you get that from you get that from Grandma's idea right that's it y of what Spirit meant cuz she's got scared one day cuz something went through the house she thought the wind blowed and blowed the curtain and she jumped up and down but you see in that other dimension we call Heaven can't you comprehend that God is real amen that's right then as he begin to condescend into this Dimension as we would call it was he losing the fact of being real and just becom an anointing a spirit that just floats around no form to it where did you get that from right well I just believe the Bible said God is a spirit that's true right but why don't you believe more of the Prophet what he be talking about he created a spiritual being right right which is US y well then God must have been spiritual being amen you see that's where I've spent all of my time trying to emphasize the importance of believing in the the uh reality of a living God and how real he is because as I just said if it was like the wind the prophet said then we wouldn't have to pray for the Holy Ghost it would just be in us right and then you would run ground when brother Ram would say that the person of Jesus Christ comes into you in the new birth right brother I thought it's just an anointing anointed ones are just anointed that's right they don't have the person of Jesus Christ in their soul they're just Anointed with what they believe a spirit y That's Right Good Feeling y the Holy Ghost ain't just a good feeling he is a wonderful feeling but he's real he's not just floating around imaginary thing that's what I tried to get you to see right all right Spirit man is not just a spirit it's real amen right what was God brother brandom so if we can see what God was we can see what this 126 and 27 man was right and find out how when he was created and how he came into being what is your god is your god real that's right now Jesus standing on Earth one day said I said show us the father yep he said have I been so long with you that's right don't you understand he said if you seen me you seen the father cuz God is real amen what Anna of God's real when she stood here Wednesday night had been sick for weeks go ask her if God is real and see that she was totally delivered amen well ask brother Stewart right over at brother pageant right been diagnosed with cancer treatments chemos radiums and everything the way he said it but he says God healed him I took him a prayer cloth I believe God when you P the prayer cloth around here that day for me you didn't know you passed two they because you just picked up Sister Gail had Jun them they picked up two well I made sure I kept one okay I ain't giving away all my blessings now I'll rub it on you brother colie maybe let you bar but you ain't going to give okay I got to thinking I thought there's two in there and I thought now what's going to happen with brother Stewart and that's what I told him I believe you're healed but I said the devil's going to try to come back now that's right he's going to fight you I said just remember there's more of us praying than you think right they gave him the prayer clock cuz you see I believe it amen I believe in God being real amen yes sir and doing what he said he would do amen right but brother Ram let's get on it brother Richard I just say brother Joe y'all get whose in the backroom let's look at Hebrews 4 1957 91 to evening service paragraph 229 you read all the others and everything but look what he says was God a man certainly no no brother Dale God is Spirit well now you just argue with the Bible and brother Brown in the Bible they saw things yep Moses saw the back part of a man right amen now that's according to the Bible now brother brandham said what he saw was a theophany MH man he said in that I'm quoting different places he said in that man became flesh you know what that man looked like I believe back there Moses the back part of Jesus all right look like that is your god that real that's right brother Dale you you just confuse us with all I thought I understood all about spirits God being a spirit and and I just feel his presence and I would to God one day he would just open your eyes I felt his presence I've been in those places I smelt his presence I've told you about it I've seen his presence I would to God that he'd open your eyes and let each each one of you view something just for a second right of how real is walking and just feeling something and just looking where are you cuz knowing that I'm not subject to lares and things but to be able to feel the presence of almighty God right i' still rather see him in the word revelation that's right cuz Satan can impersonate those feelings right he can get all involved with you and you think you see things right but the word's real all right was God a man certainly let us make man in our own image what was God a the off a body a body a man y I thought we believe the Bible Hebrews what is it 7 4 is that where it is where it talks about mzd and it says the man right right amen right you know that man sat down there and ate calf right ate meat drank milk bread right yep he was a man amen right look at it there was man and there man was made like that and put Over the Garden put Over the Garden you ain't got to the sixth day yet you understand what I'm saying right right you ain't got the natural man yet and I don't like that you know my English is no good ain't they did put it in the dictionary I'm capable of using it I used it a long time before they put it in the dictionary right maybe that's why they put it there maybe they heard me so much but and there man was made like that and put Over the Garden but there was no man to tell the sa you ain't got to gen you ain't got to the sixth day yet see in the senses he wasn't there he created man Out of the Dust of the Earth in the animal life and that man killed the soul and that man fell by transgression certainly or correctly and God the theop come down and was made flesh that's right and dwelt among us to redeem the man that's right so I believe God's real amen Jesus said unless you believe I am he you will die in your what sin what is sin disbelieving disbelieving what God says all right okay what was he made in look at the next one questions and answers on Hebrews 3 paragraph 8 41 which is 1957 106 look what do we do my dear Saed brother my dear sainty sister before the foundation of the world when God created You In His Image are created The Man In His Image and created the woman in the image of the man for the glory of the man he made you a theophany just like himself when day six no that's the natural man this was before the foundation of the world we just read read he made you a theophany just like himself when he said let us to the creatures that he made talking to the animals right let us make man in our own image and our likeness a theophany God had never become flesh yet he was in theophany Moses saw him now you go on and read so what was made before the foundation of the world brother Brandon with the ofy man right now here's where we come to technical wording in our human terminologies the word made is like something you do you know and the word creation signifies a beginning right a human terminology but this man of 126 and 27 was God in another form amen that was not a creation no more than Jesus was the beginning of the creation of God and no more than the quote I gave you the other week where brother randam said God was his first creation right you remember that one yes God was his first creation he said then out of that came the logos what do you mean God when God begin it's words terminologies right to try to express the condescending of that God to where we can comprehend him and what kind of words could you use we're a new creation in Christ Jesus that's eternal life right now how could eternal life have a beginning we put it you you got a new creation that's easy to understand amen but how could eternal life have a beginning right so we use the word creation and the word creation to us always signifies something that was nonexistent right and then something that was made right as Jesus Took The Five Loaves and the couple of fishes or what it was which had States at there and they begin to create but remember he didn't throw away the two fishes and Loaves and then stand there and start no no he kept bringing it off the original right that's right so it's not even to signify our human words of creation right our human words of creation mean something that was created right there right all right now when brother R said when before the foundation of the world when God created You In His Image sure you said well look at our something was created I preached it back three or four messages ago that when God Elohim self existed as the prophet said stepped over in another form to be the word the Son of God the Loos the theophany if we wasn't in him then we never will have eternal life that's right amen was that a creation like something different no God in another form right God in another form before the foundation of the world remember the messages we preach that we were chosen in him amen not chosen by him or chosen of him we were chosen in himen when was he chosen when God stepped over in another form Amen to begin to create that was God's choosing to do that not God choosing like one's over here one's over there I'll take this and leave that one he never has done nothing like that amen it's when he stepped over in another form right you become a new creation am but not something that would have signifying no beginning and then a beginning because that's our words now sister said something to me about it and she said I hope you explain that one these day I said I'll get back to it what so much to Creation cuz it does sound odd doesn't it right CU we take the word creation and we make it something that was in non-existence and then we bring it into existence but as I was saying about the fish and the loav see and and then two we said we created a car from what did we get it off of Mars and Venus did we reach up in the A and grab some materials and do or did we take what we already had and made a car amen but what was it a new creation that's right not signifying something that was not before but then come it was just in another form before right so is it with God right right God just stepped over in another form to be able to where we could in some way one day be able to comprehend I said one day because I don't quite understand it I claim to believe it what he's revealed to me is what I understand amen now I still have my questions because as long as we in this world we're going to have them right but I believe we're getting closer amen but see going down to number three which would be uh the believer's position in Christ 1955 uh 1166 a service paragraph e35 look what he said listen you don't remember it neither do I but we were before the foundation of the world right now we don't believe in the Mormon doctrines and etc etc that's right so how was we before the foundation of the world little people running around little napoleons I believe I was there no no was in God right or else we got a problem but we was before the foundation of the world when God made made man said let us make man our own image let us give them plural let us get make man in our own image Spirit man and give them dominion over the fish of the Sea and the cattle and so forth he said Genesis 1 God said let us make man all before the foundation of the world this 126 and 27 man was a part of God Amen right right how you going to say it cuz that's what your Prophet said amen he said we're just a part of God right amen he said not like a lamb or an arm no we're part of God where're his offspring where're his children amen and being that then we were back there ow now all these other people's got all these seeds and this and that and the other and they just come down and they make it sound so beautiful but when you get through you got the same question yeah right right amen you can shout all you want to and rejoice over what you hear but go back and check it you might be listening to Hera right right you know and I I don't think God can Quicken error well now he he quickened the truth to me and error to everybody no no no no he didn't Quicken no error to nobody he it but remember we was before the foundation of the world what part of us that eternal life that you have today amen was a part of God when he stepped over into that form called the word amen that's right now you remember who is this mezic we by Pastor the offy but he become full theophany but then the prophet said if we wasn't in him right we'll never be that's right that's right all right we become the word here yeah all right right because remember now where we're at we're coming down into the Fallen estate of mankind and getting down here where we're at and then becoming a Christian here right if we come here as a Christian with eternal life Jesus died in vain that's right that's where people don't realize that that's right as I told you there the other day the last message you remember the last couple of message that's what I preach up brother Richard and preached here why would Lucifer want to destroy Michael I hope you caught that when Michael was the only thing that kept Lucifer from being destroyed right he even protected Lucifer to where he could come to this earth and do his garbage caned plans and how long has he protected you and I to keep us from being destroyed that's right amen why would you want to destroy Michael why would you want to destroy Christ why would you want to destroy the truth amen everybody says that got the TRU I never met anybody said there's an error you ever met anybody in this message said I won't preach error to you today I had found it yet 40 something years but you see what do they do with the 126 and 27 man now there's only one man that has eternal life and that's almighty God there's only one Eternal person in this almighty God that's right there's only one soul that is eternal that's the soul of God the only way you and I can have eternal life is by accepting Jesus Christ as our savior and letting giving us let letting him give us eternal life right amen no but brother d i I know these quotes that always was eternal the eternal life you have always was eternal but was you eternal well then if you was eternal will you even have any comprehension in your mind to think that one day you was a sinner right surely there's not a human in the world that wouldn't in one way or the other admit that that some part of their life that they were Sinners surely there's not a human that would go that route now there's cooks that go that route but I said a human right amen amen a good old ficing Baptist beli that that you was lost but see the people this message want to come here saying you're saved yeah well now I've been through it over and over with you up and down through it and everything else that the only way we can have eternal life is we come here in Jesus Christ amen then Christ got to come in you and I where did Eve get her start in Adam right but the way we preach it see we preach it that it was that Adam was in Eve that's a good old Catholic Doctrine folks that's right amen but yet have the preach of the message call it Revelation yeah but listen that 126 and 27 man would have it been Jesus Christ I said it to where I wanted to Jesus Christ who is the logos theop Son of God whatever you want to call him and according to Galatians 3:16 there is only one seed right which it labels it there and says it's Christ amen yep the only way you can have eternal life is to be a part of that Christ amen so the 126 and 27 man is not the creation of all man right amen sir but yet we will cover this afternoon that man falls under that because of his creation right you know that brother around said every person in the world is a child of God by creation sure amen and that they are in the image of God in the form that they can create right right see that's where we leave it all out we don't jump over here jump over there why can't we put it all together but you see where this man was created at before the foundation of the world right then so we'll just say these few words and then quit then Genesis 2 comes into being and God creates a body called Adam y brother RAM on Blasphemous 9 said especially into Adam right he breathed the breath of eternal life right why because he was the beginning of the creation of life so you need have to begin his full grown that's why we don't believe you say well which come first a chicken or the egg kind to show how smart we are and show how dumb we are God didn't create eggs he created chickens right I don't reading my Bible he created two eggs laid them out on the Rock let them hatch I don't like jokes especially about Bible but see now you come to Genesis 2 so we pick up there this afternoon Genesis 2 will pick up the word and natural creation of man and God placed in that man eternal life right right the part of God that was eternal before the world came into the man called Adam and gave him eternal life y just as the new birth comes into you and I and God breathes into our nostrils the breath of eternal life and we become an eternal person in Soul by the new birth one the prophet said the new birth is most important thing in the world but brother Dale I've been in the message all these years I told Brother Richard Wilson this morning I said Brother Richard I realized that when the prophet of God said he didn't know how many to be saved in that last moment to to Rapture the church I said Brother Richard you realize it might be us I said of course I believe that there'll be some saved you know I believe it'll be a twofold there'll be some saved but you know could be you and I realizing we're lost and get eternal life well then I've reached my goal if it does if there's one person today that God can speak to your heart and try to get you to see that you need eternal life amen then I've done my part my part's Done Right y but I feel it there's your spirit thing we're talking about one brother there you mean to tell me that when I receive the new birth that a person comes in me right well I'm just going to put it to plain language there ain't no other way it could be that's right amen when God spoke that he spoke it ain't no other way for it to be when your Prophet said what is it Christ my God reveal what is a new birth he say it's the person of Jesus Christ revealed in you it's not a spirit to anoint you no come on brother amen it's not a good feeling it's not even a conversion of natures right you can have a conversion of nature upon your spirit being and want to go to church and Glory Hallelujah shout and all kind of thing on your spirit amen right convert that nature you I'm not throwing off on them people out there right I'm talking here right I won't call his name cu no need of but did hear a good one there yesterday that a big man in this message I'm not excuse me not a man in this message a big man in the land that was a preacher that run for president so I'll say the more he's going to divorce his wife cuz he got all Homer oh my yeah cuz he say she's dead only thing I asked I wonder what would happen if he had the alimer and she was amen it's the only thing I wonder where he changes doctor
