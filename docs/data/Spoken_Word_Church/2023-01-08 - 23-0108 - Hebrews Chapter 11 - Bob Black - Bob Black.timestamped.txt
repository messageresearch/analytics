[0:04] foreign
[0:11] could be in the house of the Lord this
[0:13] morning
[0:18] we've been studying through Hebrews and
[0:21] we made it to um if you remember last
[0:24] time we were talking about
[0:25] um verse 25 of chapter 10 not forsaking
[0:28] the assembling by ourselves together so
[0:30] we'll just kind of pick up there and
[0:31] keep moving on and uh
[0:34] and and I think we'll find ourselves in
[0:37] Hebrews 11 this morning
[0:40] oh God we're so grateful to be able to
[0:42] gather together around your word this
[0:43] morning we just ask that you'll just
[0:45] bless our study but open up these
[0:47] passages of scripture to us Lord that
[0:49] you'll give us the understanding of the
[0:51] essence of what each of these things
[0:52] mean be with us today we pray in your
[0:55] name amen
[0:57] so in verse 24 it says
[0:59] let us consider y'all y'all forgive my
[1:02] voice a little bit it's like real deep
[1:04] because I've been
[1:05] struggling with a cold or something
[1:08] um
[1:09] uh so it sounds scary I don't like to
[1:12] sound scary but
[1:15] uh anyway it is what it is
[1:18] and let us consider one another to
[1:19] provoke unto love and to good work so
[1:22] Paul's telling us we need to provoke
[1:24] provoke one another we're constantly
[1:26] provoking one another to keep to keep
[1:28] marching on and do better
[1:30] and and to love one another and to do
[1:32] good things and and one of those things
[1:35] of course is verse 25 not forsaking the
[1:37] assembling of ourselves together as the
[1:39] manner of some is but exhorting one
[1:41] another and so much the more as you see
[1:43] the day approaching I think last time we
[1:45] pretty much laid it
[1:49] thank you
[1:51] thank you brother Josh I always forget
[1:54] to do the
[1:57] that's weird I don't know I forget that
[1:59] sometimes
[2:01] I'm getting older I guess
[2:05] y'all wasn't supposed to laugh at that
[2:06] that's not funny
[2:09] not forsaking the assembling of
[2:11] ourselves together as the manner of some
[2:13] is but exhorting one another and so much
[2:14] the more as you see the day approaching
[2:16] so certainly is the more we see the
[2:19] signs of the times and the word being
[2:21] fulfilled the more that that should
[2:22] encouraged us to get to to fill it to
[2:25] Fellowship together and get together and
[2:27] more and want to hear the word more and
[2:28] all those kind of things so I was saying
[2:31] the last time we laid a pretty good
[2:32] foundation down of what uh the
[2:34] importance of coming to church and of
[2:37] course now on the flip side you know uh
[2:39] you know we lay it on the congregation
[2:41] you need to be at church but on the
[2:43] other other hand you know if if you if
[2:45] we're putting the word out there it that
[2:47] there's a promise in the Bible that
[2:48] where the carcass is the Eagles will be
[2:50] gathered together the Eagles are going
[2:51] to come to the word
[2:53] oh and so uh you know we it's it's it's
[2:57] it behooves us as ministers to to lay
[2:59] before the Lord and pray and seek God
[3:01] for his will and and study
[3:03] um uh and and just like like the brother
[3:06] will say in the Sunday lay in his word
[3:08] and and just constantly be meditating in
[3:10] it
[3:11] uh like the like the early disciples
[3:13] were doing
[3:15] the verse 26 says for if we sin
[3:17] willfully after that we have received
[3:18] the knowledge of the truth there
[3:19] remaineth and no more sacrifices for
[3:22] sins
[3:23] and after you've received after we've
[3:26] received the knowledge of the truth a
[3:27] few if you if you just kind of if you
[3:29] disregard that God gave us a sacrifice
[3:32] for sins and if we go around that and
[3:34] say well I don't want that that that's
[3:36] the only sacrifice for sins you're going
[3:37] to get there's not another sacrifice for
[3:40] sins so that's that's that's it and so
[3:43] if you cast that aside uh you're casting
[3:46] the side the only hope that God has
[3:47] given to us
[3:48] the only thing that remains for you
[3:51] Paul's saying is a certain fearful
[3:54] looking for of judgment and fiery
[3:56] indignation which shall Devour the
[3:57] adversaries and that kind of goes along
[3:59] with what John the Baptist preached that
[4:01] that if you don't bear forth fruit then
[4:03] you're going to be cast Into the Fire
[4:04] any any plant we're all like plants that
[4:07] are growing up but if you don't bear
[4:08] forth fruit eventually going to be
[4:10] casting the fire that's the warning of
[4:12] Malachi 4 that before the great and
[4:14] Dreadful day of the Lord
[4:15] before the atomic bombs fall before fire
[4:19] falls and for judgment Falls that God's
[4:21] going to give us a a chance to a chance
[4:25] to accept Christ
[4:26] uh if you if you disregard that that
[4:29] sacrifice that God made for us though
[4:31] then that's that's what awaits and so in
[4:33] verse 26 28 Paul saying he that despised
[4:36] Moses law died without Mercy under two
[4:39] or three Witnesses of how much sore
[4:41] punishment suppose ye shall he be
[4:43] thought worthy who hath trodden
[4:45] underfoot the Son of God and hath
[4:47] counted the blood of the Covenant where
[4:50] if he was wherewith he was Sanctified an
[4:52] Unholy thing and if done despite unto
[4:54] the spirit of Grace
[4:56] so if you died under without Mercy under
[4:59] two or three Witnesses in the time of
[5:01] Mercy then surely under this day when
[5:03] God has just poured out so much grace
[5:05] and mercy and and died on the cross for
[5:08] us how much more would how much more
[5:10] worthy of punishment would be we'd be
[5:12] worthy of if we would try that grace and
[5:14] mercy that God has given unto us under
[5:16] our feet like that little picture I've
[5:18] got of you stepping on somebody stepping
[5:21] on something what a horrible thing
[5:24] I'm kind of I'm kind of moving fast
[5:26] throughout through some of these
[5:27] scriptures to get so I can get to Faith
[5:29] because Paul is just kind of reiterating
[5:31] a few things that he said in the past he
[5:33] said for we know him that has said
[5:35] Vengeance belongeth unto me I will
[5:37] recommend saith the Lord
[5:38] and again the Lord shall judge his
[5:40] people it is a fearful thing to fall
[5:43] into the hands of the Living God but
[5:45] call to remembers the former days in
[5:47] which after you were illuminated ye
[5:49] endured a great fight of afflictions
[5:51] partly once you were made of gazing
[5:54] stock both by reproaches and afflictions
[5:56] and partly well she became Companions of
[5:58] them that were so used
[6:00] for he had compassion of me and my bonds
[6:03] and took joyfully the spoiling of your
[6:05] goods knowing in yourselves that ye have
[6:07] in heaven a better and an enduring
[6:09] substance cast not a way therefore your
[6:12] confidence which hath great recompense
[6:14] of reward for ye have need of patience
[6:17] that after you have done the will of God
[6:19] you might receive the promise
[6:22] I just love how encouraging Paul's
[6:24] statements are he's constantly trying to
[6:26] build up our faith to look what the
[6:28] promise is that you're you're you're
[6:29] you're working toward you don't give up
[6:32] just keep keep pressing the battle
[6:36] because he's saying for yet a little
[6:38] while and he that shall come will come
[6:39] and will not take carry now the just
[6:42] shall live by faith but if any man draw
[6:44] back my soul shall have no pleasure in
[6:46] him I got a picture of a little uh a
[6:48] daisy or some kind of a flower growing
[6:50] up because that's that's what you when a
[6:53] seed is planted it grows and it grows
[6:55] and grows until eventually it's going to
[6:56] come it's going to reproduce exactly the
[6:58] same thing that was planted again so
[7:00] Paul's saying now now it's been planted
[7:03] and you don't draw back
[7:05] you just keep pressing on and eventually
[7:07] you're going to see the you're going to
[7:08] see the fruits of what was planted in
[7:10] your heart eventually you're gonna
[7:12] there's you're gonna see that promise of
[7:14] of a body change of of of the fruits
[7:18] being working working and you remember
[7:19] all these things that that he's speaking
[7:21] of for we are not of them who draw back
[7:24] under Perdition but of them that believe
[7:26] to the saving of the Soul
[7:30] and so in that verse in Hebrews 11 it
[7:32] says now Faith is the substance of
[7:35] things hoped for the evidence of Things
[7:37] Not Seen now we are them that believe I
[7:41] believe in is is everything a Christian
[7:43] knows how to do we believe
[7:46] and now brother Brown said any questions
[7:48] and answers she said now Faith is the
[7:49] substance of things hoped for the
[7:51] evidence of things you did not see taste
[7:53] feel smell and hear but by faith when he
[7:56] catches the word
[7:58] it sends him into a dimension that makes
[8:01] it so real to him until it's just as
[8:04] good as he got it in his hand he knows
[8:07] it's going to happen
[8:10] and improving his word he said faith is
[8:13] the substance of things hoped for the
[8:14] evidence not seeing taste felt smell or
[8:18] heard you believe it and Faith now now
[8:21] here's maybe the point I want to make
[8:23] this morning as we kind of study this
[8:24] out Faith must have a resting place and
[8:28] anything that's contrary to the word of
[8:30] God faith in God can have no resting
[8:33] place until it's a promise of God and
[8:36] there it takes its Eternal stand
[8:39] and the message persevered and he said
[8:42] he said I was in a I spoke at a Kiwanis
[8:45] Club some time ago and there was a
[8:46] doctor told me that said oh I believe
[8:48] Billy I was talking about a certain
[8:50] patient he'd get up and the Lord healed
[8:52] he said oh I believe in faith and I said
[8:55] now wait a minute what kind of Faith you
[8:56] talking about he said just the faith I
[9:00] believe if that man would walk out here
[9:02] and put his hand on the tree and believe
[9:04] he was going to get well he'd get well
[9:06] just the same as what someone had prayed
[9:09] for him now now see how how some people
[9:12] believe in fight you the point is you've
[9:14] got to have something that you base your
[9:16] faith in you can't just go out and like
[9:18] sit under a tree and hope something pops
[9:20] into your head you got to have that your
[9:22] faith is based on something
[9:24] I said now who tell me doctor you're an
[9:26] intelligent looking man how could a man
[9:28] ever have faith by putting his hand on a
[9:30] tree you would make him well
[9:32] you gotta have faith in something and
[9:35] the Bible said Faith cometh by hearing
[9:38] and hearing the word of God that bases
[9:41] it your faith has got a foundation
[9:43] because God promised it right so then
[9:47] and that's in Romans chapter 10 so if
[9:49] Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[9:52] the word of God maybe maybe we could ask
[9:53] that question this morning what's your
[9:55] faith based on when we read these words
[9:57] of Paul why do we believe Paul are these
[10:00] when we when you really read any word in
[10:02] the Bible
[10:03] uh you know these these men Paul wrote
[10:06] these words down as Paul Paul's words
[10:08] why do we count what was special about
[10:11] this it's because of the character of
[10:14] God backs it up God inspired these words
[10:17] and these are not just a man's words but
[10:20] God God spoke these inspired these words
[10:23] to be written and spoken by Paul
[10:25] you you see the point that you got to
[10:28] base any anything that you believe has
[10:31] got to be based in something and so
[10:33] we're basing our faith in the words of
[10:35] not just a man but we're basing our
[10:37] faith in the words of God and it's
[10:40] backed up by his character and his
[10:42] integrity and his honesty and all those
[10:44] attributes that make up who God is and
[10:47] that's what we have comfort us in
[10:49] brother Adam said no watch the order of
[10:51] the word and you shall receive it shall
[10:53] have it first you believe you've got it
[10:55] then it'll be given to you and when you
[10:58] come make your confession believe God
[11:00] believe that he will do it and he's
[11:02] under obligation to do it
[11:04] God is worth no more than his word is
[11:08] no man is worth any more than his word
[11:11] is and God is infallible he cannot lie
[11:15] his word is true and we just accept him
[11:19] by his word and believe it it's got to
[11:21] happen and I so this morning I I believe
[11:24] maybe that this will build our faith if
[11:27] we can just really accept that God is
[11:29] not a liar that God is not going to make
[11:31] fun of you if you believe his word that
[11:33] there's not a trap laying there for you
[11:35] if you believe his word there's not
[11:36] something bad going to happen but the
[11:38] things that are written in the God's
[11:40] word are true
[11:41] and you can base everything on
[11:43] everything that God said in John chapter
[11:46] 8 he said ye are of your father the
[11:48] devil and the lust of your father he
[11:49] will do talking to the Pharisees and the
[11:51] sadduce you standing out there he said
[11:53] he was a murderer from from the
[11:55] beginning and Abode not in the truth
[11:57] because there is no truth in him when he
[12:00] speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own
[12:02] for he is a liar and the father of it
[12:04] and because I tell you the truth you
[12:07] believe me not
[12:08] he's telling you the truth in Proverbs
[12:10] chapter 3 he said trust in the Lord with
[12:13] all thine heart and lean not unto thine
[12:15] own understanding
[12:17] in second Corinthians he said that God
[12:20] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[12:22] which is blessed forevermore knoweth
[12:25] that I lie not that's Paul speaking
[12:28] and in first Timothy it says where unto
[12:31] Paul's to Paul's instructing Timothy on
[12:33] how to preach to preach the gospel and
[12:35] how to be a minister and how to how to
[12:37] be a good Christian he said where unto I
[12:39] am ordained a preacher and an apostle I
[12:42] speak the truth in Christ and lie not a
[12:45] teacher of the Gentiles in faith and
[12:47] Verity
[12:49] oh you you see what what an interesting
[12:52] thing that God has his with it he's got
[12:54] that his character of who he is is
[12:56] backing up his word and then when you
[12:58] become a Believer he's he's kind of
[13:00] transposing that down to you that what
[13:02] other people are now going to be looking
[13:03] at you to see to pursue an influence of
[13:06] what this message is and so we also have
[13:09] a mandate to conduct ourselves with
[13:11] integrity and honesty and to not lie to
[13:14] one another and to be truthful because
[13:16] people are looking at you to see what
[13:18] this gospel really is and that's what
[13:19] Paul's getting at he's saying I'm not
[13:22] telling you I'm not coming to you with
[13:23] fables and I'm not coming to you with
[13:25] tricks and flattery and things I'm
[13:27] telling you the truth and I'm telling
[13:29] you the truth so you'll believe me
[13:30] because the things that I'm you know
[13:32] what a minister is a minister is a
[13:34] peddler of Truth a minister is a peddler
[13:37] that's a merchandise our merchandise is
[13:39] the truth and like like Jesus
[13:42] he goes standing there in front of pilot
[13:44] and he said and Paula said what is truth
[13:46] and truth was standing there right in
[13:48] front of him and he didn't recognize it
[13:51] that's what
[13:54] in Ephesians chapter 4 he says speaking
[13:57] but speaking the truth in love may grow
[14:00] up into him in all things which is the
[14:03] head even crossed so Paul was telling us
[14:05] and if you go back to what Ephesians
[14:07] chapter 4 is this talking about that God
[14:09] gave a gift of the fivefold ministry to
[14:12] bring you up into the fullness of the
[14:14] stature of a perfect man of that of that
[14:16] stature and that's what he's talking
[14:17] about to do that we've got to speak it
[14:19] in Truth and speaking the truth in love
[14:22] may grow up into him in all things which
[14:25] is the head in Christ
[14:27] I was reading this at the time I speak
[14:29] in the truth in love that brother Brian
[14:30] said the truth it's got to be spoke the
[14:32] truth has got to be spoken but if you
[14:34] don't mix it with love then you'll lose
[14:36] your influence with the people
[14:38] that's interesting isn't it
[14:41] the angel of God he said the hardest
[14:43] thing that God has ever had to do is to
[14:46] get one mortal to believe another
[14:49] and an influence he said and if we take
[14:51] the testimony of being Christians I
[14:53] think that is one of the most solemn
[14:54] things that a man or a woman boy or girl
[14:58] could do would when he takes on the name
[15:00] of Christ that he is going to be a
[15:02] representative of Christ you should
[15:04] watch every move you make because
[15:06] somebody is watching you why should we
[15:08] watch every move we make every word that
[15:11] we make be careful about things because
[15:13] we want to be influenced to others and
[15:15] what Christianity really is because I
[15:17] want people to believe God that's why we
[15:20] should be so careful about the way that
[15:21] we Act and the way that we do because I
[15:23] want people I want to lead people to
[15:25] Christ that's what that's what that
[15:27] message influence is about that we're
[15:28] not interested in popularity but we're
[15:31] interested in being a Christian
[15:33] influence popularity is when somebody
[15:35] Pat you on the back and says good job
[15:38] but influence is when somebody looks at
[15:40] your life says I want to be a Christian
[15:42] because I'm looking at that person and
[15:44] that I I want what that person has
[15:47] when they can see something genuine in
[15:50] first Thessalonians Paul said but as we
[15:53] were allowed of God to be put in trust
[15:55] with the gospel even so we speak not as
[15:58] pleasing men but God which trieth our
[16:01] hearts
[16:02] for neither at any time usually
[16:04] flattering words as you know nor a cloak
[16:07] of covetousness God is witness and if
[16:10] you keep going down Paul said ye are
[16:13] witnesses and God also how holy and
[16:17] justly and unblameably we behaved
[16:20] ourselves among you that believe that my
[16:23] goodness to think about that that is a
[16:25] mandate that every Christian has to
[16:26] behave themselves like that holy and
[16:30] justly and unblameably where somebody
[16:32] can look at you and see the Life of
[16:34] Christ so manifest in you to know that
[16:37] you're not a liar that you're not an
[16:39] adulterer that God has changed so that
[16:41] you're living and doing just like Christ
[16:43] because your goal your mandate is to
[16:46] live a life that will lead others to
[16:48] Christ
[16:49] in Proverbs chapter 10 he said the lips
[16:52] of the righteous know what is acceptable
[16:54] it could not be our confession this
[16:56] morning that you know what's acceptable
[16:58] what you should say and what you
[17:00] shouldn't say what music you should
[17:02] listen to and what you shouldn't listen
[17:03] to what you should do and where you
[17:05] should go the lips of the righteous know
[17:08] what is acceptable but the mouth that
[17:11] the wicked speaketh fruitness in Psalm
[17:14] chapter 34 it says keep thy tongue from
[17:16] evil and thy lips from speaking God
[17:19] in Proverbs Chapter 12 it says lying
[17:21] lips are an Abomination to the Lord but
[17:23] they that deal truly are his Delight
[17:25] Colossians 3 9 says lie not one to
[17:28] another seeing that you have put off the
[17:30] old man with his deeds in Proverbs 11
[17:33] says the Integrity of the upright shall
[17:35] guide them but the perverseness of
[17:36] transgressors shall destroy them
[17:40] and brothers said in the prayer line he
[17:42] said now you believe I'm trying to you
[17:44] see how brother Brown I'm gonna read
[17:45] some quotes where he's he's trying to
[17:47] get people to believe him
[17:51] to be an influence to people
[17:53] people and he said now you believe I'm
[17:54] trying with all my heart to help you
[17:56] trying to do everything I know how to do
[17:58] to help you I am a Christian friend I am
[18:01] your brother and I love you with the
[18:03] dearest of Christian love I do that with
[18:05] all my heart God forbid that I'd ever be
[18:09] a deceiver I'd rather go go on home
[18:11] right now to Glory then and take my
[18:13] reward there than to try to be here to
[18:16] try to be a deceiver or to do something
[18:18] that was wrong oh no friend I'm your
[18:21] brother and I'm telling you the truth
[18:25] uh you you see how your faith has got to
[18:27] be based on something and how how much
[18:30] our faith should increase to know that
[18:32] Paul was telling us the truth that
[18:35] William Branham was telling us the truth
[18:37] that when a man stands up behind this
[18:39] Pulpit he's just not just standing up
[18:41] here to play but to tell you the truth
[18:43] to give you something that you can base
[18:45] your salvation on at your whole heart
[18:47] your whole life on tell you something
[18:50] that'll change your life and change your
[18:52] family he said I'm telling you the truth
[18:54] as my heart before God
[18:57] if I found Grace in your sight you
[19:00] believe me tonight as God's Prophet as
[19:03] far as the Divine gift that's the truth
[19:06] here lays the Bible it's over my heart
[19:08] with all my heart that's the truth see
[19:12] that's the truth
[19:14] it's a Divine gift that was given to be
[19:16] unmerited I had nothing to do with it it
[19:19] come by God's Sovereign Grace when I was
[19:22] born I had it all my life gifts and
[19:24] callings are without repentance
[19:27] and brother Brown said in the total in a
[19:29] Deliverance he said just to kind of lay
[19:32] before you how much truth matters how
[19:35] much the things that we do in life
[19:36] matters because people are looking at us
[19:39] he said I just had to do that I know
[19:41] that I did wrong I lied because my wife
[19:43] this is the story about how the the IRS
[19:46] agent and called and and he he stepped
[19:48] outside on the porch and told his wife
[19:51] just tell him I'm not here
[19:53] I think it was his lawyer anyway whoever
[19:56] it was it called and he said I lied I
[19:58] caused my wife to lie I believe I told
[20:00] you about it here at the churches a few
[20:01] days not long ago it's been about six
[20:03] weeks ago the attorneys had me so tore
[20:06] up over this investigation until I
[20:08] hardly knew where I was at I just went
[20:10] home from the office to eat dinner and
[20:12] the private phone number rang and Mita
[20:13] went to answer the phone
[20:15] she put her hand over it said it's them
[20:17] attorneys again
[20:18] I said I couldn't stand another evening
[20:20] my head feels like it's going off I'm
[20:22] losing my mind just pulling me this way
[20:24] that way and this way I said I can't
[20:27] stand it and I jumped up and I said tell
[20:29] them I'm not in here and I run around
[20:32] behind the house
[20:34] when I come back meat is very
[20:36] conscientious of those things
[20:38] she met me at the door half crying she
[20:40] said bill was that the right thing to do
[20:43] maybe let's let's let that prick us a
[20:46] little bit this morning see how it
[20:48] seemed like just a little simple little
[20:50] thing but he was he was there in the
[20:52] house and he just told her just I'm
[20:55] going to step outside and you tell them
[20:56] I'm not here but he was there
[20:59] meat is very conscious instead of so he
[21:02] said you know how you are I know how I
[21:04] am I said sure I wasn't in here right
[21:07] then I knew God had condemned me for it
[21:09] I said I wasn't in there right then said
[21:12] but you was in here when he made the
[21:13] call
[21:15] and then he said that afternoon I went
[21:17] to pray for a sick baby and before I
[21:20] left the house the phone rang again and
[21:22] little Joseph run over and took a hold
[21:24] of the phone and said Daddy
[21:26] you want me to tell him you ain't here
[21:29] you see how sin corrupts what a family
[21:32] that would finally be then I started to
[21:34] pray for this baby and when I started to
[21:36] lay my hands on it the Lord rebuked me
[21:38] and said you told a lie and you ain't
[21:40] fit to pray for that baby
[21:43] because less people are on why why would
[21:46] he why was he not fit to pray for that
[21:47] baby because he's a peddler of Truth
[21:50] truth you can't mix truth and a lie in a
[21:53] mouth of a crit of a of a minister of a
[21:55] Christian you can't mix it up and
[21:57] because people are people are watching
[21:59] you people are watching you to see what
[22:01] you're going to do and how do you act
[22:03] they were watching him his little boy
[22:05] was watching him to see see whether he
[22:07] was going to mix truth and a lie and and
[22:09] as soon as he started mixing it up his
[22:11] daddy wanted to be like him because
[22:13] people are watching you people are
[22:15] watching your kids are watching
[22:17] everything that you do your church is
[22:19] watching everything that you do people
[22:21] want to see a real genuine influence
[22:23] something something genuinely reflected
[22:26] that that famous spanish author Miguel
[22:29] de cervante said an honest man's word is
[22:32] as good as his bond
[22:37] and Jesus said in Matthew Chapter 5 he
[22:40] said again you have heard that it has
[22:42] been said by them of old time Thou shalt
[22:44] not forswear thyself but shall perform
[22:46] unto the Lord thine Oaths but I say unto
[22:49] you swear not at all neither by heaven
[22:50] for it is God's Throne known by the
[22:52] Earth for his footstool neither by
[22:54] Jerusalem for it is the great king
[22:56] neither shalt that swear by thy head
[22:58] because thou cast not make one hair
[23:00] white or black but let your
[23:01] communication be what yay or nay nay you
[23:05] tell the truth you say yeah I'm going to
[23:07] do it or no I'm not you let your
[23:10] conversation be well what does what good
[23:12] does it do if you've got the footstool
[23:14] and the Jerusalem and and heaven and
[23:17] everything all stacked up like something
[23:18] that you can place your hand on and make
[23:20] make an oath on if you're still going to
[23:22] tell a lie you just tell the truth let
[23:24] your conversation be true
[23:27] whatever is more of these cometh and
[23:29] evil in Proverbs chapter 26 I really
[23:32] like this proverb like a madman who
[23:34] throws firebrands arrows and death is
[23:37] the man who deceives his neighbor and
[23:39] says I was only joking
[23:41] like I'm it's like a madman to go around
[23:43] and say and making statements and saying
[23:46] things and stuff and then just follow oh
[23:47] I was only kidding why because people
[23:49] want to hear the truth from you the
[23:52] truth from a real Christian believer
[23:54] because that's something that you can
[23:55] base your faith in right
[23:57] brother Adam said we should have
[23:59] confidence in one another we should have
[24:01] faith in one another
[24:02] we should have faith that if we hire
[24:04] somebody in the church and they come to
[24:05] do some work for us that they're going
[24:07] to do what they say that they they do we
[24:09] should have faith and confidence in one
[24:10] another if we if we buy a car or buy
[24:13] something from somebody that they're
[24:14] going to do what they say that they're
[24:16] going to do right
[24:17] brother and said and I will restore he
[24:19] said there come a man by the name of
[24:21] Peter they know he was a prophet old and
[24:23] ananias walked up before him one day and
[24:26] he said I sold this so and so and Peter
[24:28] said you're lying
[24:30] you ever wonder what that story of
[24:31] ananiasis the fire really was about when
[24:33] it got called out in the church it's a
[24:36] story of Integrity Integrity that when
[24:39] ananiasis and Sapphire came into the
[24:41] church they were holding back the truth
[24:43] of what they were really intending to do
[24:46] and Peter said you're lying is that
[24:49] right went right down with that Spirit
[24:50] of Christ upon him and said you kept
[24:52] back a portion of the money
[24:54] frighten the old boy so bad till he felt
[24:57] dead and they packed him out here come
[24:59] his wife in Peter said you're into it
[25:01] too in a way they packed her and what is
[25:03] integrity Integrity implies
[25:05] trustworthiness and incorruptability to
[25:09] a degree that one is incapable of being
[25:12] false to a trust responsibility or
[25:15] pledge
[25:16] you see what my point this morning that
[25:18] we've got to have faith in something and
[25:20] that faith that our faith is based on
[25:22] confidence in the word of God that God
[25:25] and His Integrity the one that spoke the
[25:27] word is going to back it up if he said
[25:30] it you know that's what knowledge is to
[25:33] know that if God said it he's going to
[25:36] back it up if God said it he's able to
[25:38] bring it to pass and we're right here at
[25:41] the time so we'll stop right there and
[25:42] God bless you God is able to fulfill his
[25:45] word
[25:48] foreign
[25:51] [Applause]
[26:08] [Applause]
