[5:21] wonderful blessing down there brother
[5:23] Matthew said to tell you hello
[5:24] and he hope to see you soon so I also
[5:27] remember I did anybody say anything
[5:32] about brother JT Paget's grandson okay I
[5:35] got him I got a message from brother
[5:38] Dutch Scott that he had been
[5:39] electrocuted that's Brandon the one that
[5:41] plays to get to her thing he was
[5:43] electrocuted and hit burned his hands
[5:46] now how bad we don't know but okay
[6:00] okay all right so all right well that's
[6:04] why you get message of a message of a
[6:08] message of a message and then you know
[6:10] we we got this thing going on in
[6:13] Galesville that they're talking about
[6:15] putting a casino in gilt Ville so so
[6:18] wait a minute you laugh you laugh but
[6:22] from what we're hearing now from the
[6:24] horse's mouth we may be getting one so
[6:28] pray to Lord Jesus that we get out of
[6:29] here in the next year so we don't have
[6:31] to deal with that stupid thing in front
[6:33] of our house so then they're telling me
[6:37] that all you got to do is have a Native
[6:40] American Indian buy a piece of property
[6:41] and he put a casino there so that may
[6:44] happen you don't know but see the rumors
[6:46] got started that this was going on and
[6:48] this was going on but if you go straight
[6:49] to the horse's mouth the horse will tell
[6:51] you so we went straight to the horse's
[6:53] mouth and he said yes that is exactly
[6:55] the truth so let's pray that that thing
[6:58] doesn't happen so right there in our
[7:00] front door so good to be in the house
[7:03] the Lord turn to revelation 6 verse 1
[7:04] couldn't have always good to have always
[7:08] good to have brother Daniel sister debut
[7:10] with us always did I say that always
[7:13] okay and Rachel their daughter she's
[7:16] it's good to have her here - and where's
[7:20] Timbo Tim good to have Tim - but I was
[7:23] really wonderful that brother Daniel and
[7:25] sister Debbie are here really wonderful
[7:28] good to have them and everybody good
[7:31] they win anybody heard any more about
[7:33] the the North Carolina everybody do we
[7:36] have any believers that that got thrown
[7:39] out of their homes
[7:40] tell you what though that thing if it
[7:42] hit at a category four had been a real
[7:44] bad but the Lord graciously the Lord run
[7:47] that thing down to a 1 by the time he
[7:49] hit the hit the coast and you know what
[7:54] one day that won't happen no more we're
[7:57] heading toward that where I believe that
[7:59] we can not have to worry about that junk
[8:02] that when God did that that was a
[8:06] effects of the fall so let's turn to
[8:08] revelation 6 we're gonna start on the
[8:12] 4th see
[8:12] again and today we're going to speak on
[8:14] death before life because you have to
[8:16] have a death before you have life when
[8:19] it comes when it comes to Christianity
[8:22] and even when you look at natural seed
[8:25] when you put a natural seed in the
[8:27] ground we'll talk about in a minute when
[8:28] you put a natural seed in the ground
[8:29] something's got to die so that life can
[8:32] come forth so we got to have a death
[8:34] before life comes and that's what we
[8:36] looked the fourth seal it's called death
[8:38] and we'll get the chart back out and
[8:40] kind of get everybody back up to speed
[8:42] so let's let's go to the Lord in prayer
[8:44] mmm the Heavenly Father thank you Lord
[8:46] for bringing our pastor and his wife and
[8:49] the Brethren sister-in-law home safe
[8:51] from the journey Lord that they feel
[8:53] refreshed rejuvenated Lord ready to
[8:56] press the battle father we thank you for
[8:58] our ones among us there brother Daniel
[9:01] sister David definitely not visitors
[9:03] Lord they just a part of us we thank you
[9:05] for having them here too Lord we pray
[9:06] that you just be with each one that's
[9:07] sick ones that are not with us Lord we
[9:10] ask you to just heal the sick as the
[9:12] word goes forth you said you sent your
[9:13] word and heal the people father so give
[9:15] us something from you today Lord without
[9:17] you being here it's just it'll just be a
[9:19] meeting like a lodge or something where
[9:21] we just gather and laugh and talk and
[9:23] have a good time but Lord come down with
[9:25] your anointing father we've sung the
[9:27] songs and we prayed the prayer we had
[9:29] responsive reading we've done the things
[9:30] that we're supposed to do to get Lord in
[9:33] order that we can hear from you Father
[9:34] so today let us hear from you Lord give
[9:37] us this day our daily bread and forgive
[9:39] us of our sins bless the missionaries on
[9:41] the foreign fields give them fruit for
[9:43] their labor father just be with us and
[9:44] take care of us in Jesus name we pray
[9:46] amen revelation 6 and when he had opened
[9:49] the fourth seal I heard the voice of the
[9:51] fourth beast say come and see now who
[9:53] was that fourth beast the eagle all
[9:56] right and I looked and behold a pale
[9:57] horse and his name that sat on him was
[9:58] death and hell followed with him and
[10:01] power was given unto them over the
[10:02] fourth part of the earth to kill with
[10:04] the sword and with hunger and with death
[10:05] and with the beasts of the earth you may
[10:07] be seated in the Lord and just blessing
[10:09] to the reading of the word we're gonna
[10:10] put the chart back up today so we can
[10:12] kind of brother Danny's gonna graciously
[10:16] help me do that
[10:20] good to see brother Daniel sister debut
[10:22] with us today's I said that already
[10:24] I do that because the aggravates Rachel
[10:34] that's alright
[10:38] all right now to back up and just go
[10:41] over hmm
[10:48] tell you what we spend money on these
[10:49] things and they still tear up
[10:58] that okay
[11:02] boo devil they're right there
[11:05] all right we've been on the seals and
[11:07] now we're on the fourth seal so I'm just
[11:09] going to back up just a little bit
[11:10] you're a mind back in order with the
[11:13] seals because you got seal one two three
[11:15] and four right now we're on number four
[11:16] and remember the rapture take place on
[11:20] the fourth seal we know that say man all
[11:23] right
[11:24] so rapture takes place on the fourth
[11:25] seal you say oh what about the others
[11:27] we'll get to that later
[11:28] not today but later on but the rapture
[11:31] takes place on the fourth seal because
[11:32] there's no combat beast there's only
[11:34] four combat be the lying the ox of man
[11:36] and the eagle all right well now we're
[11:38] in the Eagle Age right here we're in the
[11:41] Eagle age so there's no more combat
[11:43] beasts oh brother Brian said therefore
[11:44] the Raptor must take place on the fourth
[11:48] seal all right everybody know that we've
[11:50] been through it now for four weeks and
[11:52] in months actually so but the seals we
[11:56] see seal one two three and four types c1
[11:58] times the first three ages seal two
[12:01] times two fourth now we got them lapped
[12:02] over because remember there is a lap
[12:04] over between all the ages all right God
[12:07] does does not just abruptly shut one
[12:10] down and start a new one he has a lap
[12:11] over all right even your messengers
[12:14] coming to lap over of the Church ages
[12:16] everybody got that right we've been
[12:17] through that forever all right because
[12:19] you mentioned you're comes right here
[12:21] right in between these ages the
[12:25] messenger comes brings his message to
[12:27] this age then they go in the ground
[12:30] another messenger comes up takes over
[12:33] preaches his message and we'll read
[12:35] where brother battle talking about the
[12:36] box but your third seal then is what the
[12:39] man and then the fourth seal is the age
[12:43] we're living in now which is the Eagle
[12:45] Age which you've got your line ox man
[12:48] and eagle you've got white red black and
[12:50] pale horses that are riding all right
[12:52] there's a spiritual aspect to this and
[12:54] then there's a natural happening mm all
[12:57] right so the first seal we type with
[13:00] justification we preached on that for a
[13:02] long time the second seal is
[13:04] sanctification which is read we preached
[13:06] on that for a while and then the Holy
[13:08] Ghost is the type of the third because
[13:11] there's only three there's only three
[13:14] listen there's only three
[13:15] manifestations of God in your new birth
[13:18] justification sanctification baptism the
[13:20] Holy Ghost but please remember one thing
[13:24] once the baby gets here you can't just
[13:27] put him up on a chair and say oh we got
[13:32] a human he'll die
[13:35] you gotta feed it and it it grows and it
[13:39] grows as it fed same thing in your
[13:42] spiritual life that's what a lot of
[13:45] Pentecostals did sure they got the
[13:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost but what did
[13:48] they do they cabbage down the prophet of
[13:51] God said are they stopped the process of
[13:55] God moving on they said nope this is it
[13:57] we're done we're finished and so God
[13:59] just moved on and brought the messenger
[14:02] to the church aid in the last stage here
[14:04] all right everybody all right with that
[14:05] I know it's kind of kind of fast but but
[14:09] the fourth manifestation is what it is
[14:12] the three brother Bram tells us on the
[14:15] fourth seal that the fourth seal is
[14:18] white red and black mixed together to
[14:21] make this horse
[14:22] so justification sanctification baptism
[14:25] the Holy Ghost mix together makes the
[14:27] word manifested in a human being called
[14:31] a bride you ma'am it's alright and then
[14:35] because that's what you got to have you
[14:36] gotta have four stages to be with your
[14:40] Joel and we're going to read in Ezekiel
[14:42] and we're going to read in several
[14:43] places where there's four things that we
[14:47] have to do to bring the rest to get full
[14:49] restoration because I'm gonna read you a
[14:52] statement in a few minutes there must be
[14:55] a restoration before there's even a
[14:56] resurrection
[14:58] you can't bring a resurrection out of
[15:00] something impure you can't bring now
[15:03] sure we plant them in corruption but we
[15:05] have to raise them in in corruption
[15:06] therefore therefore something must be
[15:10] standing on the earth that's already
[15:12] incorruptible and man something's got to
[15:15] already be here and then because they're
[15:20] corruptible is waiting on the
[15:21] incorruptible and then to bring them
[15:24] back here so so by the Daniel don't
[15:28] don't get me
[15:28] don't get bug-eyed but I'm not worried
[15:31] about a rapture I don't even want to
[15:34] talk about a rapture hold brother we got
[15:37] to have a resurrection first without a
[15:40] resurrection they will never be a
[15:42] rapture that's why the rapture hasn't
[15:43] taken place it's because there's no
[15:45] resurrection here yet amen we got to get
[15:48] two dead Saints out of the ground we got
[15:50] to be the word manifested so much till
[15:54] the dead walk among us but right now
[15:57] we're in the corruptible part but we're
[16:01] also in the restoration part I will
[16:05] restore saith the Lord let's read that
[16:08] in Joel 2:24 because remember the four
[16:13] bugs eat it down so if four bugs eat it
[16:15] down there's got to be four
[16:18] manifestations of God to bring it back
[16:20] to what full fruition to get everything
[16:24] we need
[16:25] be glad you children of Lulla Church
[16:29] Bride of Christ in time people I'm not
[16:33] talking to dead people today if you're
[16:36] born again you're not dead now if you're
[16:37] not born again I'm talking to dead
[16:38] people
[16:39] and then be glad you children of Zion
[16:41] and rejoicing the Lord your God for if
[16:43] giving you the former rain moderately
[16:45] and he will cause to come down for you
[16:48] the rain the former rain and the latter
[16:51] rain in the first month former rain is
[16:55] what teaching rain brother branham come
[16:58] to teach us the Word of God the Elijah
[17:01] of the day but he did not see the latter
[17:05] rain he's part of the former the latter
[17:13] rain is the harvest now he saw it by
[17:16] prophetic but you and I are the
[17:21] recipient of that we're the
[17:24] manifestation we are not just part of
[17:28] the lettering we're the only latter rain
[17:30] there is go that's the harvest rain in
[17:34] the first month and the floor shall be
[17:37] full of wheat the fat shall overflow
[17:40] Lord of Mercy we're not
[17:42] gonna be wanting anything with wine and
[17:47] oil which we were in the what was it the
[17:49] third field second scene which I'm but
[17:51] hurt not the all the wine a man the Holy
[17:54] Ghost and what the anointing that goes
[17:56] with it and I will restore to you the
[18:01] years that the locust eat number one
[18:05] cankerworm to caterpillar three palmer
[18:07] worm for my great army which i sent
[18:11] among you and you shall eat him plenty
[18:13] and be satisfied and praise the name of
[18:18] the lord your god that he had dealt one
[18:20] Dursley with you Lula Church and my
[18:24] people shall never be ashamed man you
[18:27] should never be ashamed of what brother
[18:29] branham bro you should never be ashamed
[18:31] of what God's reveal to us amen now
[18:38] let's go to John 12 let's read a few
[18:39] scriptures here just real real quick
[18:41] John 12 verse 23 says in jesus answered
[18:45] them saying the hour has come that the
[18:48] son of man keep that in your mind
[18:51] because we're going to talk about the
[18:52] Son of Man why he had to be here to
[18:55] bring a resurrection that's why the son
[18:59] of man had to come back in the end time
[19:01] to bring the sign to bring the
[19:03] resurrection to bring everything back up
[19:07] that's a son of man should be glorified
[19:10] verily verily I say unto you except a
[19:13] corn of wheat fall into the ground and
[19:16] die die
[19:18] remember there's got to be a death
[19:20] before there's a resurrection how can
[19:23] you resurrect life people you can't sure
[19:27] you can have a spiritual I'm talk about
[19:28] natural you can have a natural
[19:30] resurrection unless something's died and
[19:32] you can't have a spiritual resurrection
[19:34] to let something die your old self has
[19:37] got to die except the corn of wheat fall
[19:40] into the ground and die it abideth alone
[19:44] but if it die it bringeth forth much
[19:48] fruit now we're going to look we're
[19:49] going to look at that in a minute
[19:50] because when you plant a seed in the
[19:55] ground
[19:56] yes technically it does but it's just
[20:02] the outside cuz there's life inside that
[20:06] now alright hey man alright let's go to
[20:10] the let's go to the first quote we read
[20:12] it the other day I like this quote
[20:13] because look when brother Branham came
[20:16] we'll read it in a little while maybe if
[20:18] we have time it was a message of
[20:21] restoration to bring everything back
[20:23] right the prophets of bale had just
[20:26] knocked the altar down and rocks were
[20:28] layin trots rocks revelation was laying
[20:31] everywhere
[20:32] that's scattering it 450 line message
[20:35] preachers
[20:45] what's this brother branham said i'm
[20:48] going to send this is on the fifth seal
[20:49] I'm gonna set this box up here I've been
[20:51] doing this now this is for the just just
[20:54] a review we did this last Sunday or
[20:56] Sunday for last 94 laughs I'm gonna set
[20:58] this box up here to represent that no
[21:00] watch if God sends a certain spirit
[21:02] among them that's the only thing that
[21:05] they can work by Martin Luther couldn't
[21:08] sit here today
[21:09] sure by the Holy Ghost he could after a
[21:12] while understand what I'm saying but
[21:13] other than that he's laying in the grave
[21:15] saying the just shall live by faith
[21:17] that's the new birth look to us that's
[21:19] not the new birth now hey man that's not
[21:21] the new birth that won't even get you in
[21:23] the body that just forgives you you pass
[21:25] in you see how God has moved up but
[21:28] there was a box that Martin Luther said
[21:29] in and that was what what they can work
[21:32] by is the spirit that works among them
[21:34] now will prove to you by the history of
[21:36] the church and by the opening of the
[21:38] seals that's what that's what revealed
[21:40] all these things nobody ever knew this
[21:43] till brother Branham God giving the
[21:45] revelation to open the seals to me and
[21:47] you and remember the seals are not the
[21:50] Antichrist it's a revelation of Jesus
[21:53] Christ
[21:54] it is redemption in its highest form
[21:56] well sure it's good to know that Elias
[21:59] riders Antichrist but I was telling them
[22:01] in mobile this weekend but yeah but
[22:03] where did that white horse go it rode
[22:06] away the Red Horse rode away I want that
[22:10] thing to ride away I don't want to ride
[22:13] in me I want him to go away
[22:17] that will prove to you by the history of
[22:19] the church and by the opening of the
[22:20] seals and the powers that let loose and
[22:24] watch exactly the church respond to the
[22:28] anointing and they couldn't do nothing
[22:31] else so today you are responding to the
[22:35] anointing and you can't do anything else
[22:38] but respond to the anointing of this
[22:41] hour which is to me it is the total
[22:45] opening and revealing of all the word
[22:48] you show that happening brother Browns
[22:51] day I doubt it I doubt it we're still
[22:57] here
[22:58] he said in the sixth seal he said it's
[23:00] gone from you it's not even for you
[23:01] you're not going to get it it's for us
[23:04] people
[23:05] this message is specifically for you and
[23:08] I sure there's a lot lending the grade
[23:12] there's a lot a lot of things got to
[23:14] happen but you and I the anointing of
[23:16] that box is a resurrection through a
[23:19] group called the bride and then it's to
[23:22] bring the dead back to the earth but how
[23:26] can we bring the dead back to the earth
[23:28] when we're dead
[23:29] we're dying physically we can only
[23:34] respond and that's what we're doing
[23:36] because Martin Luther's people couldn't
[23:38] respond with what's being taught today
[23:41] Wesley couldn't respond Pentecost
[23:44] definitely couldn't respond they just
[23:45] want somebody to stand up and speak in
[23:47] tongue I mean really come on me really
[23:49] if you should I'm speaking tongues of
[23:51] Pentecost was like oh that must be it no
[23:54] there's more than that there's that plus
[23:57] a man and this is the plus all right
[24:01] there by all rights a man okay good
[24:04] I like this awake crowd you respond a
[24:06] whole lot more number two
[24:13] the ones in the back ER asleep number
[24:16] two the fourth seal now we're going to
[24:19] work on back to four now I want you to
[24:21] notice the four of them notice the off
[24:24] mark of four of the spiritual matter
[24:26] mathematics God is 3 this is 4 but I've
[24:30] got already told us in Joel that took
[24:32] for death messengers knead it down and
[24:35] then brother Brown said it took for live
[24:36] messengers the line ox man and eagle to
[24:38] bring everything back up right right
[24:41] so it's an off mark what he's doing is
[24:44] he's telling you it looks like it's an
[24:46] off mark because of your three sevens
[24:49] and nines and all the things in Bible
[24:52] but see to me in earthly in our
[24:56] situation I love 4 because 4 is a
[24:59] restoration of man it's a restoration
[25:01] back to what God wanted this is for here
[25:05] is for first Antichrist white 2nd false
[25:10] prophet red
[25:11] third biker of heaven and earth and
[25:14] purgatory black which is right here
[25:18] fourth the beasts pale horse
[25:21] Satan kicked out of heaven that he talks
[25:23] about reading in Revelation 12 so he's
[25:25] telling the off number of white red
[25:27] black and pale which is what you got
[25:31] what Antichrist false prophet then
[25:34] you've got what Phi curve heaven and
[25:36] earth and then what have you got you got
[25:39] Satan coming down and Satan in this
[25:41] right when we leave Satan incarnate to
[25:45] be right when we leave when when he's
[25:48] kicked out of heaven we go to heaven
[25:49] he's kicked out of heaven sure he's
[25:51] kicked out of heaven inside of you today
[25:53] I hope I pray that he's been kicked out
[25:55] of your heaven inside because for you
[25:58] and I are supposed to be raised up
[25:59] living in heavenly places at the moment
[26:01] right now alright that okay so
[26:05] Antichrist false prophet but you know
[26:10] what the glorious thing is Satan is
[26:13] going to continue his ride after we're
[26:14] gone but he will be destroyed in a group
[26:18] of people because when death is
[26:20] destroyed the saints come back from that
[26:22] other dimension Satan has been cast out
[26:25] of everything that was weak everything I
[26:32] mean this thing everything he's been
[26:36] kicked out of this thing alright so now
[26:42] let's go to the next I'm gonna try to
[26:46] cover as much as I can today but not
[26:48] keep you remember this is remember
[26:50] remember how all the time we've we've
[26:53] put the Redemption Redemption Redemption
[26:56] so we must keep Redemption in our mind
[26:59] when we talk about the seals not that
[27:01] the Antichrist was this and that in the
[27:02] other we know that that was the seal
[27:05] that rode away but I want to know what
[27:08] the revelation was underneath that seal
[27:11] the revelation underneath that seal is
[27:13] my and your Redemption and then not just
[27:17] redeemed in soul so death has to be
[27:23] destroyed now if you're born again today
[27:25] death is destroyed in your soul but not
[27:29] in your spirit right your memory reason
[27:35] conscious affection imagination is your
[27:37] problem in my problem again one more
[27:40] time this flesh is not your problem
[27:45] this flesh only does what's motivated on
[27:48] the inside this same hand that used to
[27:51] hold the beer I'm sorry you used to hold
[27:53] a beer in this hand right here and I
[27:55] used to curse out of this mountain now
[27:56] God didn't throw my old body away and
[27:58] get me a new one
[27:59] what'd he do he changed this one but he
[28:02] didn't change this flesh he changed the
[28:05] motivator down inside but still I have
[28:09] problems you know why it's like brother
[28:10] Nell said he said I didn't like beer til
[28:12] I got saved and then every time somebody
[28:14] open the beer well you know who that is
[28:16] that ain't the devil in his soul doing
[28:17] that that's the devil anointing his
[28:19] spirit to try to do that amen so it's
[28:22] not your flesh so forget about your
[28:24] flesh sure your flesh is the product of
[28:27] sin but it's not sin
[28:29] you're gonna live in that body for an
[28:31] eternity that's a revelation that we
[28:36] don't understand living this body this
[28:39] body redeemed not another body because
[28:44] resurrection is not replacement Jesus
[28:47] didn't resurrect in another body but yet
[28:54] he stood there one day great revelation
[28:58] to me the other day I told you about
[29:00] great revelation to me my problem was is
[29:02] is how am I gonna stand in a corrupt
[29:04] body are you how are you gonna stand in
[29:06] a corrupt body and call the Dead Saints
[29:08] out of the ground
[29:09] Jesus stood in a corrupt body you saw
[29:14] his body was dying folks Jesus's body
[29:18] looked 50 but he was only 30 so
[29:20] something in his flesh was dying because
[29:22] he came into this world and then but he
[29:25] stood one day and he said Lazarus come
[29:29] forth I am the resurrection and the life
[29:33] and you know what Martha got so confused
[29:36] she said oh I know my brother will raise
[29:39] in the resurrection she throat that
[29:41] thing thousands of years ahead when he
[29:44] was standing right there beside of her
[29:46] could that be our problem folks the
[29:53] resurrection has got to be among us in
[29:58] us not benches and chairs and walls and
[30:01] tapes and it's got to be a live message
[30:08] we're not gonna take a tape recorder
[30:10] listen to me we're not gonna take a tape
[30:12] recorder out there in the in the
[30:14] graveyards and set it down and match
[30:16] play and expect the people to come out
[30:19] of the grave no it's gonna be somebody
[30:21] stand one day and say I believe
[30:23] everything that the Prophet said I
[30:26] believe everything that the Bible says
[30:27] and it all connects and then death has
[30:32] to be destroyed a resurrection has to
[30:34] take place this is on the fourth seal
[30:36] then a rapture takes place rapture is
[30:39] the last thing a rapture is what is a
[30:42] what it's a what does rapture me ecstasy
[30:46] it means the the pinnacle the point of
[30:50] the top point so that rapture takes
[30:52] place but how'd you get there oh no
[30:56] brother Mark I just appeared and there I
[30:58] was I was looking to know please when
[31:02] you were a baby you were a baby but then
[31:05] you grew up and that's why you grow up
[31:09] brother those priests in the statue of a
[31:11] perfect man that's got to be in place
[31:13] how you gonna get a resurrection without
[31:16] that thing in place because that man was
[31:19] standing there he was the perfect man
[31:22] standing on earth in a body that was
[31:27] corrupted that okay maybe that will help
[31:33] boost your faith a little bit because a
[31:35] lot of times you know what we say wait a
[31:36] minute you know what Satan says to us
[31:37] how you gonna get the dead out of the
[31:40] ground and you looked in the way you are
[31:42] yeah right right right Ray's going gray
[31:45] is gonna go I am the resurrection
[31:49] but you know what I didn't bother Jesus
[31:53] they didn't bother him they didn't
[31:56] bother him and say I am the resurrection
[31:58] and the life I'm sure he probably wasn't
[32:00] feeling good that day maybe he's been on
[32:02] a four-day journey he's probably a
[32:04] little tired and any wept remember
[32:07] afterwards hope but a rapture takes
[32:10] place on this seal so if something's got
[32:11] to happen to destroy death a
[32:14] resurrection takes place and then a
[32:16] rapture is is is just the trying to the
[32:23] culmination of everything that's
[32:25] happened will be the rapture so I'm not
[32:28] looking for the rapture please don't
[32:32] just look for the rapture and I like
[32:39] that I'll see you in the rapture that's
[32:40] okay but I want to see in a resurrection
[32:43] I want to see the Dead come back because
[32:45] they got to they got to come back here
[32:49] through the opening of these seals is
[32:51] what's going to bring the dead out of
[32:53] the ground and I believe that's what it
[32:57] was sent for what's it for a rapture a
[33:01] rapture is going to take place amen
[33:05] unavoidable but the things that lead up
[33:09] to it it's what you and I had lost down
[33:12] through the ages man had preached this
[33:15] was it and this was that listen even
[33:17] when Paul was on the earth talking about
[33:20] an out resurrection sitting in heavenly
[33:24] places to see the message preacher they
[33:32] go out and start preaching the
[33:33] resurrections already happened hello
[33:38] remember Paul had to rebuke them Paul
[33:42] had to rebuke him that's what's
[33:43] happening now folks that's what's
[33:46] happening now we got message preachers
[33:48] thinking what brother Brian said and
[33:49] they go out and preach it in this room
[33:51] sorry resurrections not going to happen
[33:54] without the perfect word being in place
[33:58] but now where is Satan oh he's in the
[34:01] bar
[34:02] he's in the whorehouse he said he got
[34:07] here before you did and he was sitting
[34:10] right here when y'all got here and he'll
[34:13] be sitting around here when you leave
[34:14] because he's got in your spirit realm
[34:17] and he's playing in your memory reason
[34:20] conscious effect listen if you're born
[34:23] again forget about you so it's going
[34:29] free ticket right but you got to feed
[34:33] that baby you got feed that baby and
[34:36] whether your flesh feels good or not
[34:39] your memory reason conscious affection
[34:41] imagination it's where your problem is
[34:45] so I'm not worried you know I went to my
[34:47] 40th class reunion last night Josh and
[34:50] Danny were there they were a year well a
[34:53] couple years back and forth but we had a
[34:56] 40 year anniversary and I told him I
[34:59] said I know we were going to have a
[35:03] meeting with all of us there I said
[35:06] because the haircare aisle at Walmart
[35:08] was empty never seen as much fake in my
[35:14] life I told them I said I know every one
[35:17] of these aids because we all graduated
[35:19] together
[35:20] but what's man doing though my point is
[35:23] man has trained I don't mind you put
[35:24] hair color don't bother me but man has
[35:30] tried to dress this thing up and that's
[35:34] okay to make it better you know I
[35:36] deliver a mail and I see these things
[35:38] you know it'll make your life 20 years
[35:41] younger feel like 20 again I just shove
[35:48] in the mailbox and then about two weeks
[35:50] later I see this pill bottle come
[35:53] and I put that pill bottle in a pill
[35:56] bottle in the same mailbox and that's
[36:01] okay I take vitamins and you know I take
[36:04] those things I need to quit eatin dhania
[36:06] Susan are looking good they're losing
[36:08] some weight that's good that's fine but
[36:10] remember remember bodily what is it
[36:13] bodily exercise profiteth little it
[36:15] didn't say didn't profit nothing is
[36:16] probably the little we don't want to
[36:18] destroy our flesh but look
[36:20] Satan's already doing that so don't
[36:21] worry about it but that spirit realm
[36:25] where the memory reason conscious
[36:27] effects an imagination is what God is
[36:31] inside if you're born again working its
[36:33] way through those senses but Satan has
[36:35] took the mind and through those senses
[36:37] that's where my memory reads and
[36:39] conscious infection because remember
[36:41] your affection is is always feel your
[36:46] love in that realm agape love is what's
[36:52] in your soul that's the love of God
[36:54] that's not to love God that's the love
[36:56] of God
[36:57] remember perfect love the prophet of God
[36:59] said was what was in that six dimension
[37:01] so that's what we're dealing with if
[37:03] you've got the new birth today you have
[37:05] perfect love in your soul but any other
[37:09] realm you deal with it's going to be
[37:12] filial love memory reason conscious in
[37:15] that spirit realm all right so the love
[37:18] of God's working this way out but you
[37:19] know what the love of this world if you
[37:23] love the world and the things of this
[37:24] world what the love of God is not in you
[37:26] the love of God now the love of God is
[37:28] what I got beloved which is right there
[37:30] on them on the pyramid there by all
[37:33] right with that okay but watch what
[37:36] Satan does though let's go to the
[37:39] national number three no getting very
[37:42] far no it is fully Satan on his throne
[37:44] offered it to God offered it to our Lord
[37:48] here you're sitting here with this
[37:50] beastly heart in him now here's the
[37:52] person the Beast incarnate devil nice
[37:54] home but we're on the fourth seal so
[37:55] we're right here at our time he makes
[37:58] his appearing here on earth under the
[38:01] false pretense oh my goodness under the
[38:04] false pretense of the true word
[38:06] he associates himself with the word
[38:12] listen he's not worried about the
[38:13] Baptist in the Methodist anymore he's
[38:16] got them this is where he's worried
[38:20] about and then he's worried about here
[38:23] this is where he's worried about he
[38:27] associates himself with the word sort of
[38:30] be so close to the what deceive that may
[38:32] deceive they're very late right
[38:34] excuse me no watch but look how he's
[38:36] going to be destroyed number four for
[38:40] sale now we had him come in last night
[38:42] with this great sword to kill we find
[38:45] out that he gets killed with the sword -
[38:48] that's a capital F the sword of the word
[38:54] you can't remember brother brems that
[38:56] you are no match for the devil you're
[38:57] not because you're weak in your memory
[38:59] reason conscious flex and imagination
[39:01] because he chose the mind God chose the
[39:03] heart and then your heart is either
[39:06] faith or doubt no gray area there but
[39:10] you've got a lot of gray area in that
[39:11] spirit realm and then sharp two-edged
[39:13] sword the sword of the word god's word
[39:15] sharp two-edged sword slays him puts him
[39:18] right down wait till them seven thunders
[39:20] uttered their voices and I believe that
[39:23] we have that group here that's hearing
[39:26] the Word of God I don't mean here in
[39:30] this building I mean here in this the
[39:32] people that are preaching the true
[39:33] message of the hour and the depth of the
[39:35] message the meat of the message and then
[39:37] not just herring dressed brother Ram
[39:39] didn't come to restore hair and dressing
[39:40] on he came to restore the word in its
[39:43] power power weight to limb seven
[39:50] thunders are the voices to that group
[39:51] who really can take the Word of God and
[39:54] hand it there it sliced it'll slice and
[39:57] cut they can close the heaven eating
[39:59] shouldn't what they want to whatever
[40:01] they want to now he's talking about the
[40:02] two prophets to a degree but he's also
[40:04] talking about you and I because remember
[40:07] the two prophets will not come to this
[40:10] earth until we're out of here so
[40:13] therefore a resurrection have had to
[40:16] take place for restoration a
[40:19] resurrection
[40:20] a rap from the Gentile Church and then
[40:22] the two prophets can come on the scene
[40:24] and do what they do but I believe right
[40:25] in that little space of time though you
[40:28] and I are going to be able to maybe tell
[40:30] a hurricane to go away I tell somebody
[40:32] the other day I said you know what I got
[40:34] a guy that all he had to do was stand up
[40:38] and say peace be still
[40:39] man can't even they've tried to blow
[40:42] them hurricane that them things are so
[40:43] huge but it's not huge to God if you
[40:47] have a hurricane in your life you say
[40:48] this thing's just too big you know what
[40:50] turned over to God let him stand on your
[40:53] boat and say peace be still
[40:54] hey man that all right that's how great
[40:59] he is but the last plague that hits us
[41:07] is spiritual death natural death people
[41:12] have been dying for me nzl thousands of
[41:14] years right people been dying physically
[41:19] but they're spiritually alive if they're
[41:22] born again all right okay so now look
[41:27] let's go go ahead and pull it up because
[41:30] spiritual death is the last thing that
[41:32] hits the church but I want you to
[41:33] realize something real quick though
[41:36] listen to me don't look at that in a
[41:38] natural death life leaves the body okay
[41:42] life leaves the body in a natural death
[41:44] it goes somewhere the body is put in the
[41:48] ground all right we'll read a scripture
[41:50] maybe in a few minutes if we have time
[41:52] for don't we maybe this afternoon where
[41:54] we we plant them in corruption you have
[41:58] to plant something before it can grow we
[42:01] plant them in corruption but we raise
[42:03] them in in corruption that's what Jesus
[42:05] said
[42:05] all right well that's what the scripture
[42:07] says when I say Jesus said he wrote the
[42:09] whole Bible is that okay when I said
[42:11] Jesus said it doesn't mean this
[42:12] red-letter because remember in the
[42:17] beginning was the word the Word was with
[42:18] God in the Word was God
[42:19] so Jesus is the word made manifest so if
[42:23] I say Jesus said it and it was in
[42:24] Galatians don't say no Paul wrote that
[42:27] thereby all right with that
[42:33] you put a human in the ground his life
[42:37] goes somewhere but if you put a seed in
[42:40] the ground a natural plant you put a
[42:44] seed in the ground what is it it has to
[42:47] have life in it but there has to be a
[42:50] death I'm getting back to what was some
[42:51] of them in ago there has to be a death
[42:52] of that outside shell coach there's life
[43:00] inside that all right but something has
[43:04] to die Jesus didn't accept the corn of
[43:06] wheat fall in the ground and die it
[43:08] abideth alone but what in other words if
[43:12] that one corn comes up it will produce a
[43:14] whole field and in another field and
[43:16] then another field and then that's what
[43:18] now we know that that was Jesus they had
[43:20] to we had to he had to be planted in the
[43:22] earth he was dead Jesus Christ in the
[43:26] first part of him was dead laying in the
[43:30] grave cold and dead but remember he was
[43:35] alive so he said step the corn wheat
[43:38] going the ground one that we know to
[43:40] that the corn wheat went in the ground
[43:41] around here in the fourth Age in the
[43:44] Dark Age remember right but it's to come
[43:49] back but not to go in the ground again
[43:52] hey listen we can't all be dead in a
[43:56] resurrection happens somebody's got to
[43:58] be alive because the dead in Christ
[44:01] shall rise first we'll get to that maybe
[44:04] next Sunday and we which are alive and
[44:07] remain shall not prevent so in other
[44:12] words we're prevent we're preventing and
[44:13] hindering them from getting here amen
[44:16] this whole thing hinges on enough to
[44:20] witnesses 144,000 even the Millennium
[44:23] Millenium can't start you said watch too
[44:28] much no God pressurized you for this
[44:30] time he puts you in a place where you
[44:33] can understand what's going on if you
[44:35] can't understand what's going on you
[44:37] need to be somewhere where you can
[44:38] understand what's going on so this is
[44:40] too late but if you plant that corn seed
[44:43] in the ground but
[44:44] you know what let me give you a little
[44:46] revelation now I would think that he had
[44:51] lost his rocker some of the family
[44:55] thinks he already lost him but that's
[44:56] okay ask but if he plants all this corn
[44:59] seed and then I go over there one
[45:01] morning and he's he's sitting in his
[45:03] chair looking down that row two days
[45:08] later he's still sitting there looking
[45:10] down that row you know what he's doing
[45:12] he's waiting for that seed to come up
[45:15] but you know what's happening ain't
[45:17] nothing happening where he can see it
[45:21] ain't nothing happening where you say it
[45:23] Louis what's happening is underneath in
[45:26] the earth there's life there's a process
[45:30] there's a death but in underneath there
[45:34] and then what does he see he sees the
[45:36] manifestation that there's already life
[45:39] and that's what's happening that he saw
[45:41] there's nothing happening don't be the
[45:44] one to stamp sets and looks in the
[45:45] garden and wait for the whole corn to
[45:46] come up you plant a seed if it's got
[45:52] life in it it'll come up so all that
[45:56] work though you can't see it until that
[46:00] little thing pops up several days later
[46:02] about that high and all of a sudden you
[46:06] see a manifestation of the life there
[46:08] was a lot of work brother out going on
[46:10] underneath that soil maybe you'll get
[46:16] that one day alright let's go to this
[46:21] right here but look we're not we're I'm
[46:26] not worried about physical death if
[46:27] you're born again you shouldn't be
[46:28] worried about physical death spiritual
[46:33] death is the last thing to strike the
[46:34] church you should all it's got to be
[46:36] them denomination they're already dead
[46:42] they're already there the way you worry
[46:44] about them because remember we hang on a
[46:52] lot about Eve having sex relation with
[46:56] the beast in the garden to cause the
[46:57] fall that did not cause the fall that
[47:02] didn't cause the fall Eve accepted it in
[47:07] her mind first then what happened is her
[47:12] body yielded to what that thing inside
[47:15] now remember remember she had to lie for
[47:20] guarding her soul her theophany was
[47:24] eternal according to the Prophet and I
[47:26] believe that remember Eve was in
[47:29] theophany and Adam and then they were
[47:30] separated I don't believe he gave her a
[47:33] lesser soul he gave her the soul of God
[47:37] so she didn't send in her soul she
[47:42] reasoned in her memory reason conscious
[47:46] affection imagination you know why you
[47:49] know why I know that happened go that's
[47:51] how the devil gets the menu not this but
[47:55] this will manifest what's inside and
[47:57] that's what happened so what this was
[47:59] both physical and spiritual Brennan's
[48:01] book words Regency first and anytime
[48:06] there's a physical and a spiritual death
[48:08] with E first and anytime I told you
[48:11] asked you this morning sisters to
[48:13] forgive me so I can mention that any
[48:15] time that a woman takes the wrong step
[48:17] I'm talking about crossing the bride now
[48:18] but anytime a woman takes a wrong step
[48:21] she has the first receive it in her mind
[48:24] some slicker has to persuade her hold on
[48:28] let me read it again some message
[48:29] preacher has to persuade her is a
[48:36] Baptist gonna as a Baptist preacher
[48:37] gonna come in here today and deceive you
[48:39] I hope not
[48:44] I hope not but anytime a woman takes the
[48:49] wrong steps she has to first receive it
[48:51] in her mind the first wound that was
[48:54] polluted was not her physical wound the
[48:56] first wound that was polluted was her
[48:58] fifth was her mind Amen right some
[49:02] slickers so first it hit Satan hit Eve's
[49:06] mind and then the will of her mind she
[49:10] doubted God's Word then come the actual
[49:14] ID and the only way that we can ever be
[49:18] born again now look if you want to know
[49:20] right here the prophets telling you
[49:22] anyway if you want to know brother
[49:24] Dale's been preaching on the new birth
[49:25] for a year or so this one quote should
[49:28] answer it right here because brother Ram
[49:31] says the only way that we can ever be
[49:33] born again if you believe brother Ram
[49:35] was a prophet he's telling us something
[49:36] I said if you believe brother Branham
[49:39] with the problem he's telling you
[49:40] something right here first in the womb
[49:43] of the mind receive the word and then
[49:49] the Spirit comes on top of that and
[49:52] brings it to life there you are that's
[49:57] what does it that's the real gospel
[50:00] teaching brother
[50:01] I believe it st. Paul standing here he
[50:05] teach the same thing I do in this hour
[50:08] so how do you get the new birth receive
[50:10] the word receive the word in the womb of
[50:13] your mind and then the Holy Spirit comes
[50:16] on top of that word and brings it to
[50:17] life that okay I'm just telling you what
[50:22] the Prophet said get mad at him if you
[50:23] man met him I'm just reading you a quote
[50:28] the only way never be born again
[50:30] now let's go number six cuz remember we
[50:32] still got to cover this everybody all
[50:36] right
[50:36] amen now we're coming down to the last
[50:39] plague last thing and I'm God said I'm
[50:43] tired of fooling now I'm gonna give the
[50:45] last plague now I want you to notice the
[50:47] lags
[50:48] last plague was death now we've had
[50:52] quakes and I picked this quote out and I
[50:55] thought it was kind of striking with all
[50:57] the things going on or
[50:58] quakes manhunt earthquakes in Hawaiian
[51:00] and typhoons in in Philippines and this
[51:03] whole world shaking and this big thing
[51:05] that just hit here you know they just
[51:07] one or two behind it so now we've had
[51:09] earthquakes we've had wars and rumors of
[51:11] wars
[51:12] this is 1953 we've had tidal waves as
[51:17] Jesus said would be the sea irori man's
[51:20] heart failing more heart trouble number
[51:23] one disease fear perplex of time
[51:26] distressed between the nation horseless
[51:28] carriages in the Broadway cars all these
[51:32] things fulfilled but the last plague is
[51:35] death not physically speaking but
[51:38] spiritually speaking death spiritually
[51:41] in the church you notice it was amongst
[51:44] the sons spiritual death the church has
[51:47] got more members than it ever had
[51:48] thriving better than it ever did and yet
[51:51] the weakest in the spirit that it ever
[51:53] was that's true that's just like what it
[51:55] was in Egypt remember all the plagues
[51:57] hit Egypt finally the last plague was
[51:59] death and without the token applied over
[52:03] the door you died firstborn you and I
[52:05] are the firstborn Jesus Christ with the
[52:09] firstborn but you know what we're joint
[52:11] heirs with the Church of the white
[52:14] firstborn all right so if you don't have
[52:16] the token applied then one of the Death
[52:19] Angel comes you die amen but remember to
[52:26] have blood over the door you got to have
[52:29] a lamb inside the house you gotta have a
[52:32] lamb inside the house then you ply the
[52:36] token you can't apply the token without
[52:38] a lamb in the house hey man Lamb of God
[52:41] you get you can apply you throw blood
[52:43] everywhere no you got to have a lamb and
[52:47] that lamb had to what died that lamb had
[52:51] to die and then you eat the lamb same
[52:54] way with the Word of God
[52:56] all right let's go to number seven the
[52:58] unveiling of God they spiritually die
[53:02] now this is a spiritual veil that was a
[53:06] natural valley stone method the veil of
[53:08] the temple all right this is a spiritual
[53:10] veil they
[53:11] walking right on in behind there you can
[53:14] tell them oh I know I know that but I
[53:16] see go ahead that's all right it only
[53:18] speaks you remember the last plagues in
[53:20] Egypt was death before the Exodus the
[53:23] last plague on earth is spiritual death
[53:26] before the Exodus then they'll be
[53:30] cremated and turned back to the dust hmm
[53:34] what when all the atomic stuff blows up
[53:37] they'll be cremated and turn back to the
[53:39] dust and the righteous will walk out
[53:40] upon their ashes but the last thing is
[53:43] spiritual death rejecting the word and
[53:47] the word went into the ground at Nicaea
[53:50] we know that for a fact brother I'm told
[53:52] us but remember the life went down in
[53:54] the roots it didn't kill the tree you
[53:56] can't kill the Tree of Life
[53:58] but you can kill the effects of the Tree
[54:01] of Life and that's what the problem is
[54:02] they've they've took away the the pom
[54:04] warm light a pillar and the other one
[54:06] they have taken away what fellowship and
[54:09] all these things so it's for it's going
[54:12] to do it
[54:14] take this down then for it's got to
[54:16] bring us back that's why we see steel
[54:17] one two three and four steel four is
[54:20] what we leave we get out of here all
[54:24] right but now five six and seven has
[54:26] something to do with it because we're
[54:29] Gentiles we get all of it
[54:30] Israel gets 144,000 they get 1260 days
[54:34] preached by two prophets that's it
[54:36] there's this specific that's a you know
[54:38] they come in you and I are Gentiles
[54:40] we're scattered that man then all right
[54:43] so the word wind of the roots but said I
[54:46] will restore now what happened was right
[54:49] here we may talk about a little bit this
[54:53] afternoon but right here what happened
[54:57] was Satan began to fool the whole world
[55:03] the whole world today is food by Satan
[55:10] they all agree on Father Son Holy Ghost
[55:12] baptism they all agree in the Trinity of
[55:15] God amen they all agree in eternal hell
[55:19] the oh the world the whole world Oh
[55:23] religious world agree agrees on that
[55:25] that's why it's going to be so hard what
[55:29] Satan has done he's attached itself to
[55:31] the word so that he looks like the word
[55:34] he looks like the word but they'll come
[55:39] a showdown because he can't stand all of
[55:42] it and you and I are gonna be the
[55:45] manifestation of all of it but he fooled
[55:47] everybody what not with corruption of
[55:49] the body Satan didn't come in and make a
[55:51] prostitute a prostitute what do you do
[55:53] that prostitute is motivated by what's
[55:56] inside of her we were we were looking at
[55:59] the what we look at what was the mayor
[56:03] of Joe or somebody was listening to the
[56:06] testimony of had the testimony of the
[56:09] woman that was the drunk and all what
[56:11] was her name
[56:13] Rosella now God didn't throw her body
[56:17] Wayne gave her a new one he cleaned that
[56:19] one up he didn't clean the body up
[56:22] itself he cleaned the motivating spirit
[56:24] that was inside that body and brother
[56:26] Brent said she went out in what she's
[56:28] testifying to the world had that God
[56:32] changed her that's the same way with you
[56:34] and I because the rest of the world
[56:36] you're corrupted in your mind first you
[56:39] have to accept it in your mind first
[56:41] that's why that even though that Satan
[56:45] is doing that though but remember the
[56:47] Bible always talks about hearing the
[56:49] word hearing the word hearing the word
[56:53] open the eyes of my heart Lord I want to
[56:57] see you but I want to hear you and then
[56:59] I want to hear what you got to say
[57:01] because look revelation 13:5 tells us
[57:04] this and they worship the dragon wood
[57:10] gate power into the Beast and they
[57:12] worship the Beast saying who is likened
[57:14] to the beast who is able to make war
[57:15] with him and it was given unto him a
[57:17] mouth speaking great things and
[57:18] blasphemies and power was given in him
[57:21] to continue forty and two months and he
[57:23] opened his mouth in blasphemy against
[57:25] God to blaspheme his name now this is
[57:27] supposed to be the most religious person
[57:29] in the world this is going to be the
[57:30] Antichrist that's going to lead a
[57:32] religious awakening hello a religious
[57:37] awakening
[57:38] where they're going to persecute us a
[57:40] little while but they're going to kill a
[57:43] hunt they're going to kill the foolish
[57:44] virgin for what they believe because
[57:46] it's outside of what they believe and it
[57:50] was given unto him to make war with the
[57:52] saints and to overcome them and power
[57:57] was given unto him over all Kindred's
[57:59] and tongues and nations and all look all
[58:03] seven billion people on this earth that
[58:08] dwell upon the earth shall worship Him
[58:11] whose names are not written in the book
[58:14] of the life of the lamb slain from the
[58:17] foundation of the world that's the only
[58:19] thing that will keep you amen
[58:22] that's the only thing it's going to keep
[58:24] you and I from falling into that trap
[58:27] that all right say ma'am first Timothy
[58:37] first Timothy said but she that liveth
[58:40] and pleasure is dead while she liveth
[58:46] seven billion people are Walking Dead
[58:49] all but all but the bride were the only
[58:51] people that are alive we're the only
[58:54] people that have life eternal life but
[58:59] she that liveth in pleasure is dead
[59:02] while she liveth hey listen the
[59:05] denomination's they love their
[59:06] denomination Catholics you know
[59:10] Catholics love their cat they love their
[59:12] Pope they die for him amen
[59:15] but she that liveth him pleasure is dead
[59:18] while she liveth they're all right I
[59:22] mean but I want to say something right
[59:24] here about this about this guy that
[59:27] we're talking about that's so powerful
[59:28] let's go to Isaiah 14 hours our fallen
[59:35] from heaven o Lucifer son of the morning
[59:37] how art thou cut down to the ground
[59:39] which didst weaken the nation's now this
[59:41] is the all-powerful
[59:42] devil Satan himself this is not talking
[59:46] about another person this done by him
[59:48] for thou hast said in that heart I will
[59:51] ascend into
[59:52] and I will exalt my throne above the
[59:55] stars of God and I will sit also upon
[59:58] the Mount of the congregation tell you
[1:00:02] who he's that he's in the congregation
[1:00:03] in the sides of the north I will ascend
[1:00:06] above the heights of the clouds I will
[1:00:08] be like the Most High yet thou shalt be
[1:00:12] brought down to hell to the sides of the
[1:00:14] pit they that see thee shall narrowly
[1:00:18] look upon thee and consider these saying
[1:00:20] is this the man that made the earth to
[1:00:23] tremble that did shake Kingdom that's
[1:00:27] what's got to happen to me in you you
[1:00:30] got to look and say is that the man
[1:00:31] because remember he's one he doesn't
[1:00:34] have any power I just read where he says
[1:00:36] power was given power was given power
[1:00:37] was given power was given we give Satan
[1:00:41] power once we take it away from him
[1:00:44] though Jesus which stood one dance did
[1:00:46] the Prince of this world's come has
[1:00:47] nothing to me now can you say that I
[1:00:50] want you to start confessing it I want
[1:00:53] us to start confessing that because you
[1:00:55] know what that statue of a man perfect
[1:00:57] man if you come to that that proves that
[1:00:59] Satan's been destroyed in you Allah can
[1:01:05] see brother branham because he was a
[1:01:06] complete grief he's in the grave wait no
[1:01:12] me and you what he preached is going to
[1:01:16] bring him out of the ground there's not
[1:01:22] gonna be clear tape recorder let's let's
[1:01:27] finish right here I got a few things
[1:01:28] that I wanted to bring it but I want
[1:01:32] there must be a restoration before a
[1:01:35] resurrection I will restore remember the
[1:01:39] promise of Joel I will restore now was
[1:01:43] reading this and I was thinking about
[1:01:45] you know Elijah when you do in first
[1:01:47] Kings to save time we won't read that
[1:01:49] remembering first kings are what
[1:01:51] happened the 450 prophets a bale what
[1:01:53] did they do they jumped up and down on
[1:01:56] that altar with their false teaching
[1:02:02] broke the altar down scattering the
[1:02:05] altar scattered worship got a little out
[1:02:08] of hand but did their but did their God
[1:02:11] show up no but they did tear the
[1:02:16] sanctuary down they did say you can cut
[1:02:19] your hair and they did say there was an
[1:02:20] eternal hell and they did say that you
[1:02:22] could do this and they did say you could
[1:02:23] do that
[1:02:26] brother Brown said it was a weakness
[1:02:28] behind the pulpit because we're sheep we
[1:02:32] have to be led have to be led
[1:02:35] we're sheep you better just believe that
[1:02:38] we all are
[1:02:40] we're sheep to be led by the chief
[1:02:43] Shepherd our problem is is we get out of
[1:02:46] the fold every once in a while but what
[1:02:49] did he restore cuz remember what he told
[1:02:51] him he told him he said in other words
[1:02:54] you've destroyed this so what did he do
[1:02:55] he took 12 he took all the stones and he
[1:02:57] put them back in place let me read that
[1:03:00] that's just too good not to read let me
[1:03:02] read that Bob will read it anyway that
[1:03:05] okay all right here we go first Kings 18
[1:03:08] verse 29 I don't think they have this
[1:03:10] but listen to what I'm saying and it
[1:03:11] came to pass when midday was passed this
[1:03:14] is verse 29 if you want to pull it up
[1:03:15] that they prophesied until the time of
[1:03:18] the offering of the evening sacrifice
[1:03:22] that sound familiar this is the evening
[1:03:27] time later than you think then that that
[1:03:33] there was neither voice nor any to
[1:03:36] answer nor any that regarded in other
[1:03:40] words silence and Elijah said unto all
[1:03:45] the people come near unto me now think
[1:03:51] of what the profit of guarding this last
[1:03:52] day did for us and put it in this scene
[1:03:56] come near unto me gathering the people
[1:03:59] together and all the people came near
[1:04:02] unto him and he repaired the altar of
[1:04:05] the Lord that was broken down he
[1:04:08] repaired all those false doctrines that
[1:04:11] had been up until the evening time
[1:04:13] they'd been false doctrine
[1:04:15] repaired all that false doctrine and
[1:04:17] Elijah took 12 stones according to the
[1:04:19] number of the tribes of the sons of
[1:04:20] Jacob
[1:04:21] remember you can't forget Israel because
[1:04:22] this message is going to Israel to what
[1:04:25] to restore them not back to temple
[1:04:27] worship but the worship of the true God
[1:04:29] and Elijah took 12 stones according to
[1:04:32] the number of the tribes of the sons of
[1:04:33] Jacob unto whom the word of the Lord
[1:04:35] came saying Israel shall be thy name now
[1:04:37] watch and with the stones what is a
[1:04:40] stone revelation and with Revelation he
[1:04:45] built an altar in the name of the Lord
[1:04:46] and he made a trench about the altar as
[1:04:49] great as would contain two measures of
[1:04:51] seed and he put the wood in order
[1:04:57] thereby right with that and cut the
[1:05:00] Bullock in pieces and laid him on the
[1:05:03] wood and said fill four barrels wine ox
[1:05:10] man and Eagle fill four barrels with
[1:05:17] water and pour it on the burnt sacrifice
[1:05:20] it on the wood right and he said do it
[1:05:23] the second pool then he said do it the
[1:05:29] third pool he did it three times and the
[1:05:33] water ran we're out of bounds the altar
[1:05:35] and fill the trench also with water and
[1:05:37] he came to pass at the time of the even
[1:05:40] offering of the evening sacrifice that
[1:05:43] the lines of the Prophet came near and
[1:05:44] said Lord God of Abraham Isaac of Israel
[1:05:46] let it be known this day that thou art
[1:05:49] God and Israel and that I am thy servant
[1:05:52] and I've done all these things at thy
[1:05:54] word
[1:05:56] hear me O Lord hear me that this people
[1:06:00] may know that thou art the Lord got in
[1:06:03] that thou has turned their heart back he
[1:06:07] didn't say hearts he's quoting Malcolm
[1:06:09] or Malachi was actually quoting him
[1:06:12] remember we turn the heart back then the
[1:06:16] fire of the Lord fell why he had to
[1:06:18] restore he had to turn the heart back
[1:06:20] first then the five the Lord fell and
[1:06:23] consumed the burnt sacrifice and the
[1:06:25] wood and the stones and the dust and
[1:06:27] licked up the
[1:06:28] that was in the trench and when all the
[1:06:30] people saw it they fell on their faces
[1:06:31] and they said Lord the Lord hears the
[1:06:34] God the Lord he is the God and then what
[1:06:37] do you do with the prophets a bale took
[1:06:39] him down to the river and slew every one
[1:06:40] of them
[1:06:42] listen prophets are really nice people
[1:06:44] until you cross them with the word amen
[1:06:48] so now let's read this one thing right
[1:06:50] here to set up for this afternoon let's
[1:06:52] go to Ezekiel 37 because I never really
[1:06:55] seen this - me and brother Matthew was
[1:06:57] talking about it this past weekend
[1:06:58] because remember we look at the off
[1:07:00] number for their bow right we look at
[1:07:03] the off number for but for his
[1:07:04] restoration all right man I tell you I
[1:07:08] thought I was getting asleep and cried
[1:07:09] this afternoon what are you sleeping for
[1:07:11] this morning you just got up this is
[1:07:14] life good staying up all night might be
[1:07:21] able to sleep the hand of the Lord was
[1:07:22] upon me and carried me out in the Spirit
[1:07:24] of the Lord and sent me down in the
[1:07:25] midst of the valley which was full of
[1:07:26] bone and caused me to pass by them
[1:07:31] roundabout and behold there were very
[1:07:34] many in the open Valley and lo they were
[1:07:36] very dry but now watch and he said unto
[1:07:39] me son of man capital s son of man can
[1:07:46] these bones live I've looked through
[1:07:50] seven Church ages and I saw a lot of dry
[1:07:53] bones I saw a lot of dryness but I will
[1:07:58] restore and I answered O Lord thou
[1:08:01] knowest and again he said unto me
[1:08:03] prophesy upon these bones and saying to
[1:08:07] them oh ye dry bones hear the word of
[1:08:11] the Lord thus saith the Lord God unto
[1:08:14] these bones now he's talking to bones
[1:08:17] he's not talking to flyff he's talking
[1:08:20] to bones he's talking to bones behold
[1:08:26] that will cause breath to enter into you
[1:08:28] and you shall live each oh that's it
[1:08:30] we're done the bones just popped up and
[1:08:32] started breathing is that what happened
[1:08:35] no because you started with bones
[1:08:39] it's not good to have flesh without
[1:08:41] bones it's not good to have muscle
[1:08:43] without bones take the bones out man

[1:10:06] the prophet it's telling them what's
[1:10:08] gonna happen that's what happened to you

[1:10:13] time straight I mean straight to us
[1:10:16] so I prophesied as I was commanded and
[1:10:20] as I prophesied there was a thunder
[1:10:27] there was a noise and behold a shaking

[1:10:42] shakes your whole house today and the
[1:10:44] bones came together because remember the
[1:10:47] bones were even scattered
[1:10:49] he had to put the skeleton together I
[1:10:52] hope you're getting something here and
[1:10:54] when I beheld lo the sinews and the
[1:10:57] flesh came upon them and the skin
[1:11:01] covered them above they were still
[1:11:04] laying down there was no breath then
[1:11:10] said he unto me prophesy unto the wind
[1:11:13] prophesy not Son of God not son of David
[1:11:17] son of man and say to the wind thus
[1:11:21] saith the Lord God come from the four
[1:11:25] winds line arts man and Eagle come from
[1:11:29] the four winds o breath and breathe upon
[1:11:30] these slain that they may live so I
[1:11:34] prophesied listen this is the prophecy
[1:11:36] but you and I are going to live the
[1:11:38] reality of this so I prophesied as he
[1:11:42] commanded me and the breath came into
[1:11:44] them and they lived and stood upon their
[1:11:47] feet an exceeding great army then he
[1:11:50] said unto me son of man capital s these
[1:11:55] bones are the whole house of Israel sure

[1:11:59] about Israel are you gonna take you out
[1:12:03] of this yet were you just gonna say last
[1:12:06] for Israel no that's for me and you so I
[1:12:10] prophesied as he commanded the breath
[1:12:11] came into them and they lived put it on
[1:12:12] the feet sitting right on these tend to
[1:12:14] me son of man these bones are the whole
[1:12:16] house of Israel behold they say our
[1:12:18] bones are dried and our hope is lost we
[1:12:22] are cut off for our parts therefore
[1:12:25] prophesy and saying to them watch this
[1:12:28] thus saith the Lord God behold o my
[1:12:31] people I will open your grave I will
[1:12:40] open your graves and cause you to come
[1:12:45] out of your graves and bring you into
[1:12:48] the Land of Israel and ye shall know
[1:12:51] that I am the Lord when I have opened
[1:12:54] your graves o my people and brought you
[1:12:57] up out of your grave and shall put my
[1:12:59] spirit in you
[1:13:01] and ye shall live and I will place you
[1:13:04] in your own land then shall you know
[1:13:05] that I the LORD have spoken it and
[1:13:08] performed it saith the Lord now it's
[1:13:11] already been spoken

[1:13:15] believe it let's stand our feet you got
[1:13:22] to believe listen we all wait we all we
[1:13:27] need to look here one more one more
[1:13:30] thing let them bring it up right here
[1:13:31] Hebrews four and twelve now this is our
[1:13:34] scripture for this day I believe for the
[1:13:37] word of God is quick and powerful and
[1:13:38] sharper than any two-edged sword
[1:13:41] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[1:13:44] soul and spirit what we've been talking
[1:13:45] about now our problem is as we get all
[1:13:48] convoluted that he's talking about the
[1:13:50] soul and then we said no he's talking
[1:13:51] about the spirit and he was saying well
[1:13:53] my flesh is bad forget the flesh forget
[1:13:56] the flesh you're not gonna ever make
[1:13:59] that flesh better until you make the
[1:14:01] inside got better alright but look it
[1:14:04] took a prophet to come to separated and
[1:14:06] tell us the characteristics of the body
[1:14:08] spirit and soul and of the joints and
[1:14:12] marrow that's bone that's what is in
[1:14:15] your bone and as a discerner of the
[1:14:18] thoughts and intents of the heart it
[1:14:20] took a prophet to come to divide that to
[1:14:22] show us can these dry bones live can
[1:14:26] this dead Pentecostal Turks live can
[1:14:29] this dead whatever you want to call it
[1:14:31] live yes it can live hear the word of
[1:14:38] the Lord

[1:14:45] that Ezekiel was hearing the word of the
[1:14:47] Lord
[1:14:53] can these dry bones live somebody
[1:14:59] prophesied that they live like we saw it
[1:15:03] but he said he promised he said I'll
[1:15:06] bring you out of that grave and I'll put
[1:15:13] life in you comes I'll promise you one
[1:15:15] thing when they come out of that grave
[1:15:19] they ain't gonna have to dig their way

[1:15:24] happening that nobody in the world is
[1:15:26] gonna know nobody in the world is gonna
[1:15:28] know except the bride of Jesus Christ is
[1:15:30] the only people that's gonna know why
