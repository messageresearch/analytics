[13:24] coming
[13:25] for since the father fell asleep all
[13:28] things continued
[13:33] for this they willingly are ignorant
[13:36] of that by the word of god the heavens
[13:40] were of old
[13:42] and the earth standing out of the waters
[13:44] and in the
[13:47] the water that then was being overflowed
[13:51] with water
[13:52] perished but the heavens and the earth
[13:55] which are now
[13:56] by the same word are kept in store
[13:59] reserved unto fire against the day of
[14:01] judgment
[14:02] and perdition of ungodly men

[14:16] living
[14:17] the lord is not slack concerning his
[14:20] promise
[14:21] as some men count slackness but is long
[14:24] suffering to us

[14:28] that all
[14:28] should come to repentance but the day of
[14:32] the lord shall come in the night
[14:35] into which this shall be supported
[14:38] when the north and the elements shall
[14:41] melt

[36:50] among us and just bless each one lord in
[36:52] jesus name amen
[36:55] john 3 we just use this again for
[36:59] what we're getting into today
[37:03] verse 1 there was a man of the pharisees
[37:05] named nicodemus the
[37:07] ruler of the jews the same came to jesus
[37:09] by night and said unto him
[37:11] rabbi we know that they are the teacher
[37:13] come from god for no man can do these
[37:15] miracles
[37:16] that thou doest except god be with him
[37:18] now remember
[37:19] how we were bringing out winds wednesday
[37:21] he he
[37:22] this wasn't just a five-minute
[37:24] conversation
[37:26] this is just what's written down as to
[37:28] what would take place
[37:29] if you've seen this in a movie uh you
[37:32] know projected of what was being seen
[37:34] it wouldn't just be it would be a 10 or
[37:37] 15 minute
[37:38] uh segment ever how you call that of
[37:42] of doing it to give you him coming in
[37:44] the greetings they sit down and talk
[37:46] they do things you know
[37:47] but it's just recorded what is here
[37:49] nicodemus wanted to know
[37:52] some things all right then
[37:56] and he comes to the right one well i
[37:57] went in when he did he says
[37:59] we know that he recognized the lord
[38:01] jesus that thou art a teacher come from
[38:03] god
[38:04] for no man can do these miracles that
[38:06] thou doest accept god be with him
[38:09] and jesus answered and said unto him
[38:10] verily verily i say unto thee
[38:13] except a man be born again he cannot see
[38:15] the kingdom of god he can't understand
[38:18] me nicodemus said unto him how can a man
[38:22] be born when he's old can he enter the
[38:24] second time into his mother's womb and
[38:26] be born
[38:28] jesus answered verily verily i say unto
[38:30] thee except a man be born
[38:32] of water and our spirit the spirit he
[38:34] cannot enter
[38:36] now see you could see and then enter
[38:38] into the kingdom of
[38:40] god that is born of the flesh is flesh
[38:43] and that is
[38:44] which is born of the spirit is spirit
[38:46] marvel not that i said
[38:48] unto thee you must be born again you may
[38:51] be seated the lord
[38:52] have his blessings to the reading of the
[38:55] word
[38:56] now remember what we were bringing out
[39:01] wednesday night that if you look up the
[39:04] original translation you'll see
[39:06] that jesus was saying you must be born
[39:09] from above
[39:11] all right now nicodemus was
[39:14] expressing what it would be like to be
[39:16] born from the earth
[39:18] because it wouldn't do us any good no
[39:21] because he knew as i said wednesday
[39:22] night he
[39:23] he knew the teachings or else he would
[39:26] not come
[39:27] this wasn't a thornt temple of a coin
[39:29] you know and said well i think i'll go
[39:30] down and talk to him
[39:32] no he knew about him he'd heard about
[39:34] him he he wanted to meet the lord jesus
[39:37] and
[39:37] you know and see the things so he goes
[39:40] down
[39:40] and and has a conversation with him and
[39:44] in doing that he was trying to find out
[39:46] some things
[39:48] but as the lord jesus began to speak to
[39:51] him
[39:52] you know he said you must be born again
[39:56] well you know that threw a man for a
[39:58] luke that was uh
[39:59] thinking that everything was fine in his
[40:01] lineage and
[40:02] all of the things that's expressing
[40:04] wednesday but
[40:07] he said how can that be he said i know
[40:10] kind of your teaching your teachings is
[40:12] that
[40:12] that we was born wrong and now you're
[40:16] trying to tell me that i must be born
[40:18] again
[40:19] what does that mean well you say well a
[40:21] poor old man
[40:23] that's what we used to say in the
[40:24] baptist you know the poor old nicodemus
[40:28] all he had to do was believe
[40:31] well you know i'm not throwing off on
[40:34] nobody
[40:35] i'm just saying that a lot of people
[40:37] believed and didn't get saved
[40:38] nicodemus did put his life on the line
[40:40] his job on the line
[40:42] is his is a you know
[40:45] big high place position was on the line
[40:48] for the basis of what he was doing
[40:51] but now i was trying to get a point
[40:55] across this past wednesday to you that
[40:58] that i've been driving at for months and
[41:00] months and months
[41:02] you know and you know that i made this
[41:05] statement no telling how many times
[41:08] that see the soul of an individual
[41:13] we we look at bodies we can see them
[41:16] we can see manifestations of uh
[41:19] what would be called spirit people you
[41:21] know realms and things we can talk to
[41:24] one another we can imagine we can carry
[41:26] on conversations and
[41:28] and discuss things you know and and we
[41:30] can do all of that
[41:32] and we look at those things and we're
[41:34] actually thinking that that's
[41:36] real and don't don't forget now
[41:39] please don't you know that we are a unit
[41:42] right of body spirit and soul all right
[41:46] and we must have those to display
[41:49] ourselves
[41:50] and without any one of those we would
[41:53] not be alive or doing
[41:55] so don't don't lose that in the point
[41:57] that i'm trying to bring
[41:59] but we make i believe in ourselves we
[42:02] make our
[42:02] our body and our spirit realm to be more
[42:06] real
[42:07] than we do the the soul and then we just
[42:09] don't really know what the soul is and
[42:11] we just
[42:12] you know we just well i don't really
[42:14] know i guess it's the nature of the
[42:16] spirit you know and
[42:17] and all like that well all of those
[42:19] things are well and good
[42:21] no but the soul of the individual as
[42:26] i've tried for months and months now to
[42:28] express
[42:29] that is the part of you that lives on
[42:31] after death
[42:33] the body goes to the grave the spirit
[42:35] goes back to god who gave it you know
[42:37] but the soul has to go somewhere and
[42:38] abide so why don't
[42:40] we get down to realizing the reality of
[42:43] the soul of an individual
[42:45] and what makes the difference between
[42:47] the the
[42:48] the animal and the human being is the
[42:51] fact of the human being
[42:52] having a soul and and you know that
[42:56] makes us
[42:56] into the basis of of in god's
[43:00] image because it was in our body that
[43:03] was created in the image of god that's
[43:05] created an image of the animals
[43:07] but see we can look at something and we
[43:10] make the point that well that's real
[43:14] when there's something within the
[43:16] individual that is a whole lot more real
[43:19] you know than what we can see right as
[43:22] we look at the outside
[43:24] or we even look at manifestations and
[43:27] things of what we're doing you know
[43:28] there's something within us that's real
[43:31] and that's what i'm trying to deal with
[43:34] see and i was trying to express to you
[43:36] there wednesday
[43:37] that satan
[43:42] he cannot create now that's you know
[43:45] forget it brother brown said that we
[43:47] brought the quotes to you wednesday
[43:49] you know if you're going to believe
[43:50] brother brown and believe if not go and
[43:51] believe what you're going to believe
[43:52] anyway
[43:53] you know short time from now we're going
[43:55] to be worried about it but the way
[43:56] things is going
[43:57] you know and i'm praying lord bring it
[43:59] on quicker
[44:01] even though lord jesus come let's get
[44:03] out of here let's get on with this and
[44:04] what we got to do
[44:06] go by the grave or wind up in in glory
[44:08] one and get on with something
[44:10] because you know i'm just getting tired
[44:12] of just haphazardly floating along you
[44:14] know
[44:15] and going to church and things and i
[44:17] love to go to church
[44:19] but still you know that's not all of it
[44:22] but now see satan he cannot create
[44:28] the only creation he can do is create
[44:30] confusion
[44:32] he can't create he has nothing no
[44:34] ability to create
[44:35] and see he doesn't have a soul
[44:38] so he wouldn't be creating a soul in the
[44:41] image
[44:42] of his self because he doesn't have a
[44:44] soul to start with
[44:46] he's an angelic created being then
[44:50] and you know in doing that then what
[44:52] would he how would he create it
[44:55] but what he done we we've been talking
[44:56] about it and i preached this for 40
[44:58] years to you that
[45:00] satan then he perverts the nature of
[45:03] your soul when that baby's born
[45:05] it comes into the world looking up and
[45:07] seeing and hearing the
[45:09] the loud vulgar languages and and seeing
[45:12] all of the things in the
[45:14] perversion of life because we're born in
[45:16] satan's domain
[45:18] amen and being born in this domain
[45:22] he perverts the nature of that soul that
[45:24] god gave you because the bible said all
[45:26] souls are mine you know what is ezekiel
[45:29] 18
[45:30] 4 souls are mine see
[45:33] all right then satan cannot do it but we
[45:36] want to give him more credit
[45:40] than what he's even do in life our
[45:43] thoughts
[45:44] see he can only pervert brother around
[45:46] said those fallen angels
[45:48] give you a nature we don't believe in
[45:51] pressing into it like you know they
[45:53] believe back there and
[45:54] becoming this and that and all but they
[45:56] just give you a nature because they come
[45:58] down and pervert you
[46:04] see the reason we need to be born again
[46:06] is because we were perverted
[46:08] into a way and like i told you and i
[46:10] believe it you know
[46:12] that god cannot create anything
[46:14] imperfect
[46:16] so when he created your spirit and your
[46:19] soul they were created perfect
[46:21] not eternal perfect
[46:24] amen all right because what could he
[46:26] create something from
[46:28] he can't create anything imperfect
[46:32] it's perfect but satan over time
[46:35] perverts the nature of that until we
[46:38] wind up then to be
[46:39] you know liars i mean the psalmist david
[46:44] he was smart he
[46:45] he you looked down at a little baby and
[46:47] he said with our ladies a liar well
[46:48] that's true but that's future tense
[46:51] baby can't lie
[46:54] all right but after a time comes it will
[46:58] start lying
[47:01] why because the nature of it has been of
[47:03] that soul of that individual now
[47:05] remember that
[47:06] see then the soul is what is the real
[47:08] part of us
[47:10] and that's where satan started to
[47:12] pervert
[47:13] through the head right right
[47:17] that's right because that was the only
[47:18] way he could do it brother around said
[47:20] satan started in the head
[47:21] he said god started in the heart all
[47:24] right
[47:24] so satan starts through the head to come
[47:27] down through in our memory reason
[47:29] conscious effect
[47:30] to pervert that nature and we wind up
[47:34] being as we've showed our in the
[47:36] in the book of ruth we wind up being uh
[47:38] to a point
[47:39] of where that we've actually got one
[47:41] closer ken
[47:43] and that's not just your body that's the
[47:46] whole individual
[47:48] why because it's perverted right and it
[47:51] can't come from god
[47:52] all right now we try to do that but
[47:55] as i said we try to make things more
[47:57] real
[47:59] but remember that soul will live on
[48:02] after death and it will have to be
[48:06] judged that's right
[48:08] now that's what we do here see we judge
[48:12] ourselves as being sinners
[48:14] and we accept jesus christ as our savior
[48:18] and in doing that then we don't have a
[48:20] judgment
[48:22] to come to decide eternal life or not
[48:24] there's a judgment that indeed's done in
[48:26] the body whether good or bad but that
[48:27] has nothing to do with eternal life
[48:29] right
[48:30] all right see but the soul that
[48:33] sentenced the scripture said that soul
[48:34] shall die
[48:36] or be destroyed the annihilated all
[48:40] right
[48:42] see then we got down to this part and
[48:43] that's where we want to pick up from
[48:46] see why you must be born again
[48:50] and what will take place in the new
[48:52] birth
[48:54] all right that's what i don't understand
[48:57] it i never have but that's all right
[48:59] people say brother dale is so deep and
[49:01] then i hear i dropped down so far
[49:03] until i'm talking on a level that we
[49:05] already understood
[49:07] 40 years ago you know to try to get
[49:09] people to see what the new birth really
[49:11] is
[49:12] what do you mean the new birth i come in
[49:13] a world eternal life i don't need no
[49:15] your birth
[49:19] well you're quoting brother branham but
[49:20] what about all the others
[49:22] right if one fights the other remember
[49:26] doesn't work right one contradictory the
[49:29] other one
[49:29] doesn't work right they have to fit
[49:32] right somewhere
[49:33] all right now we got down to the point
[49:37] wednesday night of talking about it
[49:41] see in the new birth
[49:46] god don't destroy your soul
[49:50] to give you a new birth that's right
[49:53] when it says in ezekiel and we haven't
[49:55] got to that yet we might use it
[49:57] this evening but we'll see when he said
[50:00] i give you a new heart and your spirit
[50:05] now that's not even that's not your soul
[50:07] he's talking about it
[50:09] right he said then i'll put my life
[50:11] within you
[50:12] there's the new birth so god begins
[50:16] in the heart whereas satan begin
[50:19] in the head
[50:22] but satan perverts through the head
[50:25] but god doesn't start to try to wash the
[50:28] head i gotta
[50:29] come in here in a minute i'll get to it
[50:30] when i get this point here
[50:32] satan doesn't try he tries he has to go
[50:35] through the head
[50:36] he can't go through your heart in his
[50:38] heart is soul
[50:39] now when i say heart you know i i mean
[50:42] soul
[50:44] all right now because it's not the
[50:45] thumping gizzard
[50:47] your heart the thumping music you know
[50:49] the thing that's pumping the blood
[50:50] throughout the body
[50:51] that's not your soul right that's a
[50:54] mechanical thing because if it is
[50:56] we would have more doctrines than two
[50:58] souls
[50:59] because you could have ten heart
[51:01] transplants
[51:03] they didn't try to chip and i'm sure
[51:04] they got two or three underway
[51:06] right so what would you be that's what
[51:09] people's worried about
[51:11] they're worried about going and getting
[51:12] a heart transplant because they think
[51:14] the heart is the soul
[51:17] and who saw what i have would i be me
[51:21] after i've got the heart transplant
[51:25] that heart is just a thumping gizzard
[51:29] all right if god don't start in your
[51:32] heart to try to
[51:34] do it that's only the that's just words
[51:36] of mankind
[51:37] he starts in the soul
[51:40] to dealing with that soul
[51:44] because that's where the new birth
[51:45] starts it doesn't start in your body it
[51:46] doesn't start your spirit
[51:48] it starts in the show right all right
[51:51] it's not an
[51:52] outward inward thing you know it's an
[51:54] inward
[51:55] outward he has to get inside to bring
[51:58] outward
[51:59] to something from the inside of us all
[52:02] right so then what do we do
[52:08] it's not your soul that died right
[52:11] well i got this quote here brother
[52:12] brother we'll go back to this policy
[52:15] and i put this on here because there's
[52:17] people you know hearing it
[52:18] and be the first time but make sure you
[52:22] check out what you're saying
[52:24] because brother branham until 62 was
[52:27] teaching
[52:27] basically now i said basically because
[52:30] there's a lot in there that he was
[52:32] he was using it in the right order and
[52:34] he knew what he's talking about
[52:35] right because he was the prophet and i'm
[52:37] in no way trying to correct he's trying
[52:39] to illustrate it
[52:41] all right the prophet basically used to
[52:43] teach that it was body
[52:46] soul second round spirit center realm
[52:50] then he comes along into 62 and it
[52:53] becomes into
[52:54] like brother claude was bringing out
[52:55] about that son of man coming into
[52:58] to the uh right um
[53:01] spear of the heavens and as it does
[53:05] then he begin to show it correctly
[53:07] because that would be hebrews 4 12
[53:09] that the word of god would be the
[53:11] discerner to tell the difference between
[53:14] soul and spirit jordan marin divided
[53:18] now so then after 62 he would teach what
[53:22] body
[53:23] spirit second realm soul sinner
[53:26] but he never changed the senses
[53:30] he always gave five senses for the
[53:32] outsides he takes phil smell here
[53:34] he always gave five senses for the
[53:36] second realm whether he would call it
[53:38] soul or call it spirit
[53:41] he always gave the five sense of memory
[53:43] reason conscious effects and blood and
[53:44] stuff like
[53:46] he said there's only one sense or one
[53:49] thing
[53:49] in the soul he said it's either faith or
[53:54] doubt so you say well brother dale i
[53:57] have a lot of doubt well that's not in
[53:58] your soul if you're born again
[54:00] right that's one thing we should get a
[54:03] lot of those things settled
[54:04] that's right a born-again christian
[54:06] cannot sin from the soul
[54:08] amen you sin in your body and your
[54:10] spirit
[54:12] you can't see him from your soul because
[54:14] the bible said his seed reminded dennis
[54:16] and he cannot sin
[54:18] all right but see that way what we
[54:22] need is to not get a new soul
[54:27] we need to yield ourselves to god and
[54:29] we'll read this in a second
[54:31] and let god then just clean out right
[54:34] what's in there amen that he doesn't
[54:36] like right
[54:38] and that's where i like that scripture
[54:40] and a lot of people thinks it's
[54:41] incorrect but the scripture said
[54:43] that it's the the holy ghost and fire
[54:48] they think that scripture is turned
[54:49] around it's not i believe it correctly
[54:53] because that fire keeps burning there's
[54:56] a lot of burning from the inside coming
[54:59] out right
[54:59] it's not burning out of the soil right
[55:02] right
[55:03] amen but it starts burning outwardly and
[55:06] i love it that way because
[55:07] this out here is what's going to either
[55:09] get burnt
[55:10] or it's going to be changed in a moment
[55:13] the twinkle of an eye
[55:14] all right now so we got the choice we
[55:16] can do what we want to about it
[55:18] all right but see it wasn't your soul
[55:21] that died
[55:22] right
[55:26] it wasn't that it was the nature of it
[55:31] which was the nature of the world
[55:35] see then that way you're not looking for
[55:39] a new soul
[55:40] when the scripture says i'll give you a
[55:42] new spirit
[55:44] now does that literally mean
[55:48] out goes one in goes another right
[55:51] or what does it mean
[55:54] you know what does that mean i give you
[55:56] a new spirit
[55:58] remember i said you couldn't stand your
[56:00] own self with your old spirit
[56:03] but what does it mean
[56:06] it means it begins to do a work
[56:10] now justification listen
[56:15] doesn't mean giving you a new spirit
[56:18] second realm
[56:20] right
[56:23] second ring i told you know all right
[56:25] real whatever you want to call it
[56:27] you want to call it soul you want to
[56:28] call it spirit second realm
[56:32] doesn't deal with the fact of your
[56:35] spirit
[56:39] the center rim is the only one that can
[56:40] deal with the fact of
[56:42] the work would say i give you a new
[56:43] heart and a new spirit
[56:49] see justification works in the soul
[56:52] right not in the body right i'll get
[56:55] back to that in a minute
[56:56] you know you get ahead of your own
[56:58] doings but
[56:59] we'll get down to it but just think on
[57:02] these things
[57:04] what is the new birth well after all of
[57:08] these years
[57:09] you know we need to know all about this
[57:11] thing
[57:12] yes so did eve
[57:16] so did eve do you know what she messed
[57:20] up with
[57:22] well i know all about what the new birth
[57:23] is brother dale well then why is the
[57:25] devil keep living outside of us
[57:27] all right that's right amen i like the
[57:30] way brother biscuit says it
[57:32] said if you see a i think he was the one
[57:33] that said at that time he said if you
[57:35] see a
[57:36] fox tail sticking out of a foxhole he
[57:38] says it pretty well sure you've got a
[57:40] fox in that hole
[57:42] i like that you and i we live like the
[57:45] devil and it's a pretty good sign who we
[57:47] belong to
[57:48] so just forget it it's not your holiness
[57:51] it's his holiness
[57:52] all right but now let's get down to it
[57:54] see we're on these wednesdays
[57:56] and we just i wanted to come back to it
[57:58] to make sure we understand
[58:00] so look at your your notes on this is
[58:02] coming from souls in prison
[58:04] preached in 1963 uh 11
[58:07] 11 10 63 in the morning service
[58:11] so now watch what the prophet's talking
[58:12] about
[58:16] remember the soul
[58:19] remember now i'm talking about
[58:23] the center rim the prophet here is
[58:25] coming up and talking about the center
[58:27] realm of you
[58:28] the soul what you really are
[58:32] and he's expressing what happens
[58:35] to us in the new earth
[58:39] well all we need to do is just accept
[58:40] jesus christ and we're you know
[58:43] well that's well and good
[58:46] but how do you know to accept something
[58:48] that you don't know what you accept
[58:51] you know i mean somebody walk up and
[58:53] hands you a box today you better not
[58:55] grab it real quick
[58:57] it might have 10 million dollars written
[58:59] on the outside you know
[59:01] but it might be a bomb too you know so
[59:04] you don't just reach and grab you know i
[59:06] want to know what's in the box
[59:09] open it up let me look at it
[59:12] and that's the way i am in the gospel i
[59:14] like for it to go through the bible and
[59:16] see what it's saying about it
[59:18] and then that way that i can understand
[59:20] so look what your prophet had to say
[59:24] he taught my souls in prison now the
[59:27] soul of man is not the body of man
[59:30] it's the soul and the soul is something
[59:33] that's
[59:33] the the nature of the spirit well that's
[59:36] exactly right
[59:39] our spirit is supposed to display
[59:42] the nature that is within us amen
[59:46] it does do it so then the the nature of
[59:50] the soul and the nature of the spirit is
[59:51] supposed to be the sun
[59:53] right right so then the souls of nature
[59:56] are spirit spirits in the nature of the
[59:58] soul
[59:58] so both quotes are identically correct
[1:00:01] right
[1:00:02] the way your prophet will be brained all
[1:00:04] right the soul is something that the
[1:00:06] the nature of the spirit and when the
[1:00:08] nature of a man
[1:00:10] when he said we are dead the scripture
[1:00:12] plainly tells us that we're dead and our
[1:00:14] lives are hidden in god through christ
[1:00:16] sealed there by the holy spirit now it
[1:00:18] says we're dead right
[1:00:20] you don't need an arguing with a dead
[1:00:22] man
[1:00:24] i've heard of people that would argue
[1:00:26] with a signpost but
[1:00:28] it doesn't do any good so you ain't
[1:00:30] gonna need an argument with a dead man
[1:00:33] all right now it wasn't that your body
[1:00:37] died
[1:00:38] listen it wasn't your spirit died
[1:00:41] it was the nature of your spirit died
[1:00:43] amen
[1:00:44] i believe that now watch the nature
[1:00:48] which is the soul amen all right now
[1:00:51] watch
[1:00:53] the nature of your soul is is god
[1:00:57] if you're born again if it's not
[1:01:01] it's of the world now that don't need a
[1:01:03] big hammer on the head to understand a
[1:01:04] great revelation though
[1:01:06] that's as plain as can be
[1:01:10] the nature of your soul is god if you're
[1:01:12] born again if you're not
[1:01:14] then it begins to explain see the
[1:01:16] continual reading going on down
[1:01:20] anything that again has to end so
[1:01:23] therefore the only way that you can have
[1:01:24] eternal life is to have a life that
[1:01:26] never did begin
[1:01:28] and then your life did begin when you
[1:01:30] were born
[1:01:32] when god breathed the breath of life
[1:01:34] into your nostrils and you became a
[1:01:36] living soul
[1:01:37] then you begin then but when you
[1:01:40] that nature that was in you by nature
[1:01:43] you was of the world
[1:01:45] all right is that what i'm saying satan
[1:01:48] comes in perverts
[1:01:49] right alienated from god
[1:01:54] you're you were actually an animal right
[1:02:00] because animals don't like like humans
[1:02:04] right humans are worse than animals
[1:02:08] amen all right you were actually an
[1:02:11] animal
[1:02:12] that's right anyone knows that we're
[1:02:15] mammal
[1:02:16] how many knows that that were mammal
[1:02:19] we're a warm blooded animal but that is
[1:02:20] what we are
[1:02:21] by our earthly creation but you see what
[1:02:24] made
[1:02:25] us different from other mammals that
[1:02:28] at god put a soul upon us see
[1:02:32] now the other mammals don't have to wear
[1:02:34] clothes
[1:02:36] no other animal has to wear clothes to
[1:02:38] hide a shame but us
[1:02:40] we're the only ones that does because we
[1:02:43] have a soul
[1:02:44] but you see god in the beginning knew
[1:02:47] what a man would be like
[1:02:49] and he created the earth and brought up
[1:02:50] all kinds of animals from the very
[1:02:52] slowest to the highest and the highest
[1:02:54] animal came
[1:02:55] forth was man so when you see man
[1:02:58] walking down the street thinking he's
[1:03:00] somebody
[1:03:01] you know and got a little education and
[1:03:03] things you remember it's the clot of
[1:03:05] indiana dust
[1:03:06] that's all and that woman that's all
[1:03:09] dressed in shorts and smoking cigarettes
[1:03:11] and carrying on down the street
[1:03:12] twisting like she owned the whole
[1:03:14] country it's the clot of indiana dust
[1:03:17] and that's the way it's turning back so
[1:03:19] you're not very much to begin with
[1:03:22] so that that's right that's what you are
[1:03:26] but that soul that's in directory
[1:03:29] that soul is what god's working on amen
[1:03:33] all right now this is fine enough to
[1:03:35] show you what he's doing to get us born
[1:03:37] again
[1:03:39] all right so now let's see that went
[1:03:42] from seven
[1:03:43] um all of those are on seven this this
[1:03:45] one is on
[1:03:46] uh number two of your notes which is
[1:03:48] page eight the soldier in prison
[1:03:50] all right and it goes on down continue
[1:03:52] reading on this one
[1:03:54] see if he can only get that nature of
[1:03:57] that spirit
[1:03:58] to agree with him
[1:04:01] and that nature dies the nature
[1:04:05] and the love of the world dies right and
[1:04:07] the things of the world is dead
[1:04:09] because if you love the world or the
[1:04:11] things of the world the love of god is
[1:04:12] not in you
[1:04:14] and a man must be born again so this
[1:04:17] nature has to die
[1:04:18] and the nature of god comes in comes and
[1:04:21] lives
[1:04:21] in you and god is the only thing
[1:04:25] there is that never did begin or never
[1:04:27] can end
[1:04:28] all right so then page nine
[1:04:31] he goes on sign one souls in prison so
[1:04:34] therefore he partnership jew
[1:04:36] taking this man earthly and this eternal
[1:04:39] spirit
[1:04:41] and put it together and god reflects his
[1:04:43] self all right
[1:04:44] so now what is
[1:04:47] what is god working on the soul of the
[1:04:52] individual
[1:04:54] not on your body because that's what we
[1:04:56] were talking about that's reason i
[1:04:57] preached some
[1:04:57] the services on the preacher message you
[1:04:59] know that
[1:05:01] where i gave a quote from brother
[1:05:02] branham that you don't like the the
[1:05:04] commander you know that said what must
[1:05:06] we do to be saved
[1:05:09] and they didn't turn around and say well
[1:05:11] what you need do you need to go to
[1:05:12] church you need to quit this you need to
[1:05:13] start doing that you know
[1:05:15] see people ask you what you do to be
[1:05:16] saying we need to go you need you need
[1:05:18] to come to lula
[1:05:20] when you come to louis you're just as
[1:05:21] lost as you was before you got here
[1:05:24] now i like the way brother brown
[1:05:26] preaches
[1:05:28] and i tell you what brother neville had
[1:05:30] to have some
[1:05:31] gumption about him he had to be a
[1:05:33] born-again christian
[1:05:35] i just met shook man's hand one time
[1:05:37] heard him speak
[1:05:38] but you know brother brown will plainly
[1:05:40] say
[1:05:42] he said won't do you no good to come to
[1:05:43] branham tabernacle they're just as
[1:05:45] messed up as any words
[1:05:53] i mean that'd be like wait getting up
[1:05:55] here and saying you know
[1:05:57] her errand you know i'm getting up here
[1:05:58] and saying that there's no need to come
[1:06:00] into the lula because they're just as
[1:06:01] messed up here they are anywhere else
[1:06:03] then i don't you know what i do i say
[1:06:04] amen
[1:06:08] brother neville's sending over holly hey
[1:06:09] man
[1:06:12] anyway we'll see everybody thankful you
[1:06:14] know if you can get to church
[1:06:16] no that wasn't what it was you must be
[1:06:18] born again
[1:06:20] now getting to church is part of the
[1:06:21] rules and regulations maybe are the way
[1:06:23] they are but
[1:06:26] it's not just because you come to church
[1:06:31] you come here and you find out in a
[1:06:32] hurry that brother dale that believes
[1:06:33] that you must be born again
[1:06:38] that's why i preach the way i do and i
[1:06:41] don't preach on power and clothes and
[1:06:42] dresses and stuff like that like all
[1:06:44] these other preachers do because mine's
[1:06:46] preached in a way that you can't back
[1:06:48] out from it
[1:06:50] because if you're looking like the devil
[1:06:52] you are the devil
[1:06:54] if you're cutting your hair paint your
[1:06:56] face you're going out here and doing the
[1:06:58] slop of the world it's
[1:06:59] you're lost don't deceive yourself and
[1:07:02] nobody else because brother dale ain't
[1:07:03] deceived
[1:07:05] right i don't say nothing about things
[1:07:07] but i'm not blind either
[1:07:10] because there's no need of it i'm not
[1:07:13] talking to your body
[1:07:15] see nicodemus thought jesus was talking
[1:07:18] to his body
[1:07:21] right he said my body go back come back
[1:07:24] again another body what good would it do
[1:07:30] jesus wasn't speaking to his spiritual
[1:07:32] realm the spirit part of him
[1:07:35] sure he's having to talk through that
[1:07:38] because that's where your memory reason
[1:07:39] conscience was stuck on
[1:07:40] but he's speaking right down into the
[1:07:42] heart
[1:07:44] that's why them people as i told you
[1:07:45] that wednesday they would finally figure
[1:07:47] out
[1:07:47] this man was talking about us
[1:07:50] all these parables he's saying and we we
[1:07:53] winding up being the devil's children
[1:07:56] they finally figured it out but remember
[1:07:58] what i told you that it says there
[1:08:00] that jesus said you you can't see you
[1:08:02] can't understand
[1:08:06] right but then he stated again he said
[1:08:08] you can't enter
[1:08:09] right why because you come and sit down
[1:08:12] in church for a while
[1:08:13] you'll have a little understanding right
[1:08:17] but just remember what understanding
[1:08:18] does
[1:08:20] the bible says knowledge puffeth up
[1:08:24] you can have a little understanding but
[1:08:26] you ain't going to see the kingdom the
[1:08:28] way jesus talked about
[1:08:29] but you can have a little understanding
[1:08:31] so he makes your nicodemus didn't
[1:08:32] misunderstand him
[1:08:33] he said you're not going to enter it if
[1:08:36] you can't understand these things you're
[1:08:38] not going to enter the kingdom
[1:08:39] because to enter the kingdom would it
[1:08:41] would mean that he'd have to be born
[1:08:42] again
[1:08:44] now he didn't go through a long
[1:08:46] discourse to nicodemus
[1:08:47] the nicodemus you just wait around here
[1:08:49] because i've got to die i've got to do
[1:08:51] this i got to do that you know
[1:08:54] the conversation just broke off and
[1:08:56] nicodemus went back the same man he was
[1:09:00] still needing salvation right so we can
[1:09:02] go to church all of our life and still
[1:09:04] sit there and distribute this is lost
[1:09:06] that's right there's one thing about it
[1:09:08] when you get there you won't be able to
[1:09:10] say
[1:09:10] i didn't hear it that's right and you
[1:09:14] you said well i didn't hear sermons in
[1:09:15] order to quit doing where do you need
[1:09:17] sermons for that
[1:09:19] right oh that's well and good
[1:09:23] you mean i got to tell you what to wear
[1:09:30] i got to tell you how to act no i'm
[1:09:31] going to tell you how to be born again
[1:09:34] he'll take care of the rest that's what
[1:09:36] your evangelists and all of those people
[1:09:38] are for
[1:09:39] is to come through and stir us up and
[1:09:41] tell us about these different kinds
[1:09:42] right but my job is to get down there
[1:09:44] and deal in that soul
[1:09:46] that you can't deny what i'm saying to
[1:09:48] be the truth
[1:09:50] then i prove it by the prophet and i
[1:09:52] just put it right down so then you got
[1:09:54] to make your choice
[1:09:56] but just remember whatever i send it out
[1:09:58] there comes your first
[1:10:01] don't ever think wrong about that part
[1:10:03] listen
[1:10:04] sure we were born in sin born in satan's
[1:10:06] domain
[1:10:07] satan perverted the nature of our soul
[1:10:10] and made that to be a condition
[1:10:13] that god would have to destroy
[1:10:18] are you listening satan put us to a
[1:10:22] position until there was no choice
[1:10:27] man was doomed yes right
[1:10:30] there was no way we could be good enough
[1:10:34] the rich young ruler go back and read it
[1:10:38] and read what your prophet said he said
[1:10:41] i kept these from my youth
[1:10:45] and the bible said jesus loved him why
[1:10:49] because he knew he was looking at a good
[1:10:53] sincere honest
[1:10:56] person
[1:11:00] but that person will end up in hell
[1:11:02] right
[1:11:04] because the hell's going to be full of
[1:11:05] good people right right
[1:11:10] but now listen so jesus said you must be
[1:11:14] born again
[1:11:18] what would have happened if nicodemus
[1:11:20] had made it
[1:11:21] far enough to the upper room
[1:11:25] yeah so something cut him off somewhere
[1:11:29] kept him from being there right now
[1:11:31] brother adam said and you you deal with
[1:11:33] him he said nicodemus and good maya
[1:11:36] would be given eternal life you need
[1:11:39] that quote i'll be glad to find it he
[1:11:41] said nicodemus and gomez remember
[1:11:42] comedians said
[1:11:43] you'd be happily fighting against this
[1:11:45] we better leave it alone instead of god
[1:11:46] we'll fight against god if you're not
[1:11:48] then
[1:11:48] don't worry about it come to know anyway
[1:11:51] he said
[1:11:52] nicodemus and gemmae would be given
[1:11:53] eternal life
[1:11:55] for their stand on the gospel
[1:11:58] all right we'll see they won't be bright
[1:11:59] i'd like to be foolish virgin have to
[1:12:01] come up another way
[1:12:02] we're not trying to deal on this my
[1:12:04] brother told me one time that sam i'm
[1:12:05] just interested in going to heaven
[1:12:08] you know well i said there's many ways
[1:12:09] to get into heaven
[1:12:12] i'm interested in the way that god made
[1:12:14] the plan
[1:12:15] you know you can be a good person
[1:12:18] and if it's good enough maybe something
[1:12:20] that you do maybe it might merit you
[1:12:22] eternal life
[1:12:22] would you like to go to the grave you'll
[1:12:24] have to be standing to watch on judgment
[1:12:27] but just remember every soul that is not
[1:12:30] clean to sin
[1:12:31] will have to die right
[1:12:34] this is there's no arguing to point
[1:12:39] it's just a final statement but see in
[1:12:42] doing that then
[1:12:44] do you have to come up to the basis of
[1:12:47] understanding
[1:12:49] what is the new birth
[1:12:54] what does it consist of is it going to
[1:12:57] church
[1:12:59] is it being good
[1:13:02] what about nicodemus standing there that
[1:13:05] jesus couldn't put his finger and
[1:13:07] evidently the rich young ruler
[1:13:09] he couldn't bring out nothing against
[1:13:10] the man
[1:13:12] what about a man standing there like
[1:13:14] that
[1:13:16] ain't me and you ain't might not be a
[1:13:19] good word but that's the plan that i can
[1:13:20] say this year not me and you
[1:13:24] i don't think any of us in here would
[1:13:26] qualify
[1:13:29] no we were all born in this perversion
[1:13:33] but now listen
[1:13:36] so then what happens
[1:13:39] god begins to work on that soul that's
[1:13:42] right
[1:13:44] he doesn't destroy it
[1:13:48] he cleans it up
[1:13:52] he washes it out he sets it aside
[1:13:59] and they just will i believe that's
[1:14:02] right
[1:14:03] but believing is part of it we'll get
[1:14:05] back to that in a minute
[1:14:07] i got a couple of kind of like
[1:14:08] questionable points and i'll put it in
[1:14:09] right here because it's a good place
[1:14:12] you know just
[1:14:18] the question or point was like this
[1:14:21] can your soul sin without your mind
[1:14:29] now
[1:14:32] number one if you're born again your
[1:14:34] soul cannot sin
[1:14:36] it's sealed that's right okay
[1:14:40] but if you're not born again your soul
[1:14:42] is already seen
[1:14:44] that's right now
[1:14:48] it says can your soul sin without your
[1:14:50] mind now remember
[1:14:52] you are a unit of body spirit and soul
[1:14:56] it all got to work together as a unit
[1:14:59] but see think on these things
[1:15:04] see you as a christian cannot sin from
[1:15:08] the soul right
[1:15:10] so it's got to be in the body and spirit
[1:15:12] part of us
[1:15:13] that we do wrong which would be through
[1:15:16] the mind
[1:15:17] the brain uh now we won't get into it
[1:15:20] because
[1:15:21] that's not the point of what's being
[1:15:22] said but see to me when i say mind
[1:15:26] i mean soul when i'm preaching
[1:15:29] because paul said to let the mind that
[1:15:30] was in christ be in you
[1:15:32] he'll make you a new creature all right
[1:15:34] see that's not your brother
[1:15:36] that's not your head that's not your
[1:15:37] mind your brain that's your soul
[1:15:41] if the mind if the soul of god be in you
[1:15:45] by the new birth then you're sealed in
[1:15:49] all right but we won't go that far we're
[1:15:51] just carrying it through about a person
[1:16:01] so you can't display sin without your
[1:16:04] body
[1:16:05] right amen
[1:16:09] if sin to a christian is in his spirit
[1:16:12] he still has to have a body to display
[1:16:14] things
[1:16:14] right so it will be working back out
[1:16:16] through her brain
[1:16:20] now i'm talking about a christian now
[1:16:22] see
[1:16:23] a christian can't sing in the soul
[1:16:25] there's no way it's not sealed
[1:16:28] so a christian makes mistakes in body
[1:16:30] and spirit
[1:16:33] all right because that's where satan
[1:16:35] attempt to stay right
[1:16:37] he could get so much that he could talk
[1:16:39] to the lord jesus
[1:16:41] to try to get him to reason but he
[1:16:43] wouldn't listen see satan's avenue
[1:16:46] is through the brain the mind
[1:16:49] the brain actually the avenue
[1:16:52] see and that's the way he contacts us
[1:16:55] down through our spirit realm as i said
[1:16:58] a while ago see he has to enter through
[1:17:00] the
[1:17:00] the head of the brain the mind that way
[1:17:04] to come down into the individual
[1:17:07] all right but if you're born again don't
[1:17:09] worry about it you can't sin in the soul
[1:17:11] amen that's right but we display it with
[1:17:14] our body because that's where we can be
[1:17:15] tempted at
[1:17:16] right now see that's the point of that
[1:17:20] where we can
[1:17:21] be tempted all right now here it goes on
[1:17:22] this is just more of the same point
[1:17:25] does the soul dictate to your mind
[1:17:29] or your mind to the soul
[1:17:32] all right now
[1:17:36] the soul is supposed to be the
[1:17:39] controlling force
[1:17:40] of an individual whether they're lost or
[1:17:42] saved
[1:17:44] that is your controlling power is your
[1:17:46] soul
[1:17:47] now to a christian then the
[1:17:53] the only way that anybody can control
[1:17:57] your mind
[1:17:58] now listen what i'm saying because it's
[1:17:59] what i mean
[1:18:02] it says does the soul dictate to your
[1:18:04] mind or your mind to the soul
[1:18:08] if you're lost your soul dictates
[1:18:12] out through your spirit through your
[1:18:15] brain
[1:18:16] mind body and you go do what you are
[1:18:20] all right but see on a born-again
[1:18:23] christian
[1:18:25] the soul is pure all right now
[1:18:29] i'm just going to say the best way i can
[1:18:35] my soul tries to dictate through my
[1:18:38] spirit
[1:18:39] to my mind all right
[1:18:42] i said twice all right
[1:18:46] because a lot of times i reason it out
[1:18:50] the memory reason conscious gets in my
[1:18:53] way
[1:18:54] and i've already got it cut off that's
[1:18:56] why that we are sick and we need healing
[1:18:59] amen the bible says we're healed he said
[1:19:01] his word and healed us
[1:19:02] but before it can come in see that was
[1:19:04] what satan done in the garden if you go
[1:19:06] to
[1:19:07] uh greatest battle ever fall brother
[1:19:10] around
[1:19:10] said satan perverted the flus
[1:19:13] now he may call it soul there so watch
[1:19:15] what i'm saying
[1:19:17] he he may say soul and say it perverted
[1:19:21] the flus but remember what he's talking
[1:19:22] about
[1:19:23] what's the flush memory reason conscious
[1:19:25] affection
[1:19:26] love whatever the fire imagination
[1:19:31] see and he that's messed up
[1:19:35] right i don't understand how god ever
[1:19:37] saves us right
[1:19:39] that's my point how does god ever save
[1:19:42] an individual
[1:19:44] right heaven the only one says because
[1:19:47] he's god
[1:19:50] that's what we'll get back to in a
[1:19:51] minute if you can get that soul to stand
[1:19:53] still long enough
[1:19:56] you know or in other words if he can get
[1:19:58] us to just
[1:19:59] thinking on the word then he can come to
[1:20:03] the point but i want to get these
[1:20:04] out of the way so the soul then is
[1:20:07] supposed to dictate everything
[1:20:11] and to a center it does you didn't have
[1:20:13] any trouble when you was lost did you
[1:20:15] right i had no trouble with anything
[1:20:17] when i've lost
[1:20:18] i just done what i wanted to do
[1:20:23] but you see when you're born again that
[1:20:25] soil within you tries to dictate out but
[1:20:28] it has a
[1:20:29] carnal spirit and body to deal with
[1:20:34] because you're not born again in your
[1:20:35] body and your spirit right it's just
[1:20:37] cleansed
[1:20:39] and really it's not cleansed like we
[1:20:41] think cleansed
[1:20:44] because you can still think about what
[1:20:45] you used to do
[1:20:47] if it would be cleansed the way we want
[1:20:49] to make it clean i would like to have it
[1:20:51] i could never remember
[1:20:52] all the things i've done what about you
[1:20:56] whether how small or how big i would
[1:20:58] love to be to where that i could just
[1:20:59] quickly
[1:21:00] quit doing it you know but god don't do
[1:21:03] it that way
[1:21:04] that's right that's why it's free moral
[1:21:06] agency all the way so he's still
[1:21:08] but that's soul of that individual then
[1:21:12] would dictate to the mind
[1:21:16] all right because your mind can't
[1:21:18] dictate to the soul
[1:21:21] the controlling force is the soul the
[1:21:24] one who dictates outwardly trying to
[1:21:26] to do but everybody else don't want to
[1:21:28] say and see to a sinner it's just all
[1:21:29] the way
[1:21:30] but to a christian that soul can only
[1:21:33] dictate as much as we will
[1:21:35] let in us and that's why hearing the
[1:21:37] word is so important
[1:21:38] that coming down through our memory
[1:21:41] reason consciousness
[1:21:43] and staying with that word and even like
[1:21:45] we say
[1:21:46] and it's a good point satan gets to
[1:21:48] bother you start singing
[1:21:52] he gets to bother you start praying
[1:22:00] how to work on these spirit and body
[1:22:03] right and that's what the adoption that
[1:22:05] we'll get to more
[1:22:06] as we go on through the doing but i
[1:22:08] wrote it this way now
[1:22:10] the soul controls the spirit
[1:22:13] and that spirit is what works out
[1:22:14] through the mind or brain
[1:22:16] right see that's what i want
[1:22:19] right i wish i could get it to where i
[1:22:21] never had no dirty thoughts what about
[1:22:23] you you said brother dale you have dirty
[1:22:24] thoughts yes
[1:22:25] you do too don't come up and garbage can
[1:22:28] me i don't play with you
[1:22:31] because satan could if he could give
[1:22:33] jesus the wrong thoughts
[1:22:34] he can certainly give us a whole lot
[1:22:36] worse
[1:22:38] and you know if we never didn't do
[1:22:40] something we couldn't remember doing it
[1:22:42] right so it's our problem right
[1:22:45] now here's the last part then i'll get
[1:22:46] back on the other
[1:22:50] if you can control your mind
[1:22:53] would it control your soul
[1:22:57] you you'll never be able to control the
[1:22:58] mind we're talking about brain now
[1:23:00] right right mind brain you can't control
[1:23:03] your brain
[1:23:05] there's no way the only way that can
[1:23:06] ever be done is let the inside control
[1:23:10] there's no way see that's what we've
[1:23:12] tried to make is christians
[1:23:14] out of people dress right do right do
[1:23:17] go to church do this and they'll we've
[1:23:19] tried to make christians in our brain
[1:23:21] situation and reasoning memory and
[1:23:23] consciousness now you know your mother's
[1:23:24] in heaven you don't want to go to heaven
[1:23:26] with her
[1:23:26] you know this is our new you see and we
[1:23:29] try to make christians out of people
[1:23:31] through a mental concept
[1:23:35] instead of a born-again experience from
[1:23:37] the heart
[1:23:39] like i told you i never got up when i
[1:23:40] was a sinner and said well
[1:23:43] i don't know whether i'm gonna go out
[1:23:44] and live for the devil today or not
[1:23:47] did you you know i'm making illustration
[1:23:51] but then we get up on sunday morning so
[1:23:52] we'll
[1:23:54] you know i don't feel too good we going
[1:23:55] church today
[1:23:57] i've never done that in the baptist i
[1:24:00] mean i never had that in a badness there
[1:24:01] was never a discussion in our family
[1:24:03] where we was going to church or not
[1:24:06] sickness or non-sickness there was never
[1:24:09] a question about that it was all ready
[1:24:11] to settle
[1:24:12] nobody comes to my house on sunday
[1:24:14] because they know they ain't going
[1:24:15] they're not nobody's
[1:24:16] right i mean they're welcome to come
[1:24:17] i'll give them the key
[1:24:20] they can cook we never want to get back
[1:24:22] and i'll eat with them
[1:24:24] but my family don't call up and we're
[1:24:26] coming off your house sunday they
[1:24:28] they never have went out of the badgers
[1:24:29] they didn't do it that's right
[1:24:31] see what i'm trying to tell you is my
[1:24:32] brain at least when i was even lost
[1:24:36] my brain didn't control me that way i
[1:24:39] could control
[1:24:40] it to the degree so there was something
[1:24:42] inside of me wanting to go to church
[1:24:46] and i've expressed to you about it even
[1:24:48] if you're lost
[1:24:50] that soul of that individual wants to
[1:24:52] worship its master
[1:24:54] even if you're lost that's right that's
[1:24:56] why you you worship total poles and
[1:24:58] things
[1:25:00] but you understand what the point see i
[1:25:02] wrote it this way the only way you can
[1:25:04] control the mind
[1:25:06] is by whatever is in the soul
[1:25:10] whatever's in the soul will control
[1:25:12] eventually has to
[1:25:14] and i'm like this now folks i'm as
[1:25:15] honest as can be
[1:25:18] i don't look at things like seemingly a
[1:25:20] lot of people look at it
[1:25:24] and i've watched them walk into death
[1:25:29] thinking these things because the way i
[1:25:31] see a lot of preachers preach
[1:25:33] they preach it like that i'm right here
[1:25:34] now this is the way i
[1:25:37] understand all right that i'm right here
[1:25:40] and i take another step and i get a
[1:25:42] little better
[1:25:44] i take another step and i get a little
[1:25:46] better i take another step the devil
[1:25:48] ain't bothering me as much as he used to
[1:25:52] right now i'm just honest you can
[1:25:54] believe that if you want to
[1:25:57] i've always said the rapture to me is
[1:26:00] taking one more step in the word
[1:26:03] you keep walking in the word as you do
[1:26:06] yes satan has less control of you yes
[1:26:09] but it will not through the opening of
[1:26:11] the word
[1:26:12] will not take away the fact that satan
[1:26:17] can still
[1:26:18] enter through our brain our
[1:26:21] human parts of us and try to get us to
[1:26:24] reason right
[1:26:28] because we did why would god have to die
[1:26:33] i'll get to that more this afternoon
[1:26:34] what would he have to die what's the
[1:26:35] purpose
[1:26:38] if we could do it on our own if we could
[1:26:41] control the mind and the spirit why
[1:26:42] would god have to die
[1:26:44] nicodemus had it
[1:26:47] nicodemus had probably better control
[1:26:49] i'm just as honest as can be now you can
[1:26:52] make what you want to out of me i just i
[1:26:54] preach like i am
[1:26:55] nicodemus probably had more control of
[1:26:57] his body and spirit than i have of mine
[1:26:59] and you have a humor
[1:27:02] i don't mind saying that and won't back
[1:27:04] up
[1:27:06] i don't like you talking about me like
[1:27:07] that well okay
[1:27:09] do something about it you know right
[1:27:14] see i'm just honest because anointed
[1:27:17] ones
[1:27:19] they where are they anointed
[1:27:22] the spirit realm right what is that
[1:27:25] memory reason cause it's effects is
[1:27:26] manchester nation
[1:27:31] and they have a great love
[1:27:35] a great atmosphere about them
[1:27:39] what's that word charismatic every way
[1:27:41] you say it you know
[1:27:43] they're all into love and
[1:27:46] and doing and giving and
[1:27:49] going and doing and right and now
[1:27:53] that's right
[1:27:56] but that don't make them christians
[1:27:58] that's right
[1:28:01] that's right he said well let's go out
[1:28:02] there try to get done the internet's
[1:28:04] open
[1:28:06] man it came to measure for putting some
[1:28:08] tile down
[1:28:11] you know i just i don't talk a lot about
[1:28:12] a lot of things but
[1:28:14] i just he said something to me and i
[1:28:16] said well
[1:28:17] we're on the internet anytime you want
[1:28:19] it spoken wordchurch.com
[1:28:22] connect on he said well you know what i
[1:28:24] don't
[1:28:25] i said you can get it live about one day
[1:28:27] later because we're live now and it's
[1:28:29] working good
[1:28:30] you know but uh i said
[1:28:34] mondays you can connect home and you can
[1:28:37] view what goes on at the church he said
[1:28:38] i don't
[1:28:39] have nothing to do a lot of times on
[1:28:40] monday well all right
[1:28:43] you say well you don't do much
[1:28:44] witnessing well maybe he might
[1:28:46] maybe that's my way of witnessing see
[1:28:49] out there
[1:28:50] because i found out i can't do much
[1:28:53] i'm not the preacher to this you know
[1:28:55] that everybody thinks i'm just me
[1:28:56] but you got it the soul is a controlled
[1:29:00] power of man
[1:29:01] and then out from that control tower
[1:29:04] we'll start the control of man and the
[1:29:06] more
[1:29:06] we feed the man inside
[1:29:10] the more control we will have outside
[1:29:13] all right that's right because like i
[1:29:16] said you get down and out start singing
[1:29:19] you know that works with the brain you
[1:29:20] know it works in the spirit realm right
[1:29:23] you know after a while the brother said
[1:29:25] they asked her they said to him said run
[1:29:27] around you said he said yeah
[1:29:29] did you live so close to god to the
[1:29:30] devil don't know what to do with you
[1:29:34] now brother brown you live perfectly no
[1:29:38] right run around you sin he said every
[1:29:40] day now what's he talking about
[1:29:43] right we ought to come to the place
[1:29:46] that our walk should be that we want the
[1:29:50] word
[1:29:51] to be revealed to curious right because
[1:29:54] it can only be from the inside all right
[1:29:55] man we got that see i just put that part
[1:29:57] in there
[1:29:58] because see then you know what i believe
[1:30:00] about it
[1:30:01] you know what i believe about the new
[1:30:02] birth because you heard me over and over
[1:30:04] and over
[1:30:06] but brother branham what is the new
[1:30:07] birth christ the mystery of god revealed
[1:30:10] number four in your notes
[1:30:11] what is the new birth then you say well
[1:30:13] brother branham what is the new birth
[1:30:16] it is the revelation of jesus christ
[1:30:21] personally to you amen
[1:30:24] now he is not talking about
[1:30:27] head knowledge right head knowledge is
[1:30:30] not a revelation
[1:30:32] according to the bible hebrews 11
[1:30:36] 1 i believe it is isn't it faith is the
[1:30:39] substance of things
[1:30:40] hoped for the evidence of things not
[1:30:44] seen faith is a revelation page 14
[1:30:47] of um
[1:30:50] i'll get it in a minute rapture
[1:30:54] yeah i believe that's right rapture all
[1:30:56] right
[1:30:57] but now listen see it's christ in you
[1:31:02] it's what the church is to be built on
[1:31:06] is what a revelation of jesus christ
[1:31:10] now as we were saying about the soul
[1:31:14] it's not the body that the body don't
[1:31:16] die right
[1:31:17] the spirit don't die the soul don't die
[1:31:20] in the new birth
[1:31:22] you say well you just read where it dies
[1:31:24] you yeah we die to ourselves
[1:31:27] did not die like god
[1:31:31] we've got to die to ourselves when the
[1:31:33] scripture says that we're dead
[1:31:36] right that don't mean that we're in the
[1:31:37] undertaker's parlor
[1:31:40] right what does it mean
[1:31:51] god comes in and it's not that you die
[1:31:55] that would be god living that wouldn't
[1:31:57] be you that's right
[1:31:58] you know how to preach that
[1:32:04] god if we read while ago shoulder breath
[1:32:07] he partnerships you
[1:32:08] right right right he comes
[1:32:12] in and he gives you eternal life
[1:32:15] he gives eternal life to your soul right
[1:32:19] then your soul is your theophany
[1:32:23] why because god has brought it to you
[1:32:25] right right amen
[1:32:27] all right
[1:32:31] that's it my brother richard says wilson
[1:32:34] see that up the statue of a perfect man
[1:32:35] you're hearing from you theophany
[1:32:37] right through the reveal word that's
[1:32:40] right and it's carrying you greater and
[1:32:42] greater
[1:32:44] you see then god comes in and gives
[1:32:47] eternal life
[1:32:50] now he puts that's why i told the two
[1:32:52] soul people i said you missed it all the
[1:32:54] way around
[1:32:55] i said if i was gonna ever preach two
[1:32:57] souls i'd preach it after you born again
[1:33:00] right sure yep
[1:33:03] see they preached two souls four years
[1:33:04] morning and i said i appreciate you born
[1:33:06] again
[1:33:07] because you know what god's got to come
[1:33:09] in your soul and live to give you
[1:33:10] eternal life
[1:33:11] he just doesn't come in an anointed
[1:33:13] right that's right
[1:33:17] the baptism of the holy ghost is on
[1:33:21] anointed ones
[1:33:24] right that don't give eternal life to
[1:33:27] the soul
[1:33:30] just cause you're anointed with the
[1:33:31] spirit of god doesn't give you eternal
[1:33:33] life
[1:33:33] right that's right but when the soul of
[1:33:37] god
[1:33:38] contacts your soul it makes your soul
[1:33:40] eternal
[1:33:41] and it puts you and god together as
[1:33:43] persons living within you
[1:33:46] and the more we let him live
[1:33:50] the better off we are you don't ever do
[1:33:52] two souls that be the point to me
[1:33:55] but that won't work see they didn't like
[1:33:57] that idea
[1:33:58] all right see i don't believe in two
[1:34:01] souls and it wouldn't be
[1:34:02] what would it be it's your soul mate
[1:34:04] eternal
[1:34:06] all right yes we'll get to it i'm going
[1:34:09] to get it
[1:34:10] when we finish it this evening but
[1:34:12] around them according to the future home
[1:34:14] tells you exactly what happened
[1:34:16] that's right
[1:34:19] he tells you exactly what happens in the
[1:34:20] new birth
[1:34:25] that anointing on your spirit doesn't
[1:34:27] give you the new birth right
[1:34:29] but the word that you've taken the
[1:34:31] disciples took the word the scripture
[1:34:33] said
[1:34:34] held it they've been with the word for
[1:34:35] three and a half years that was the only
[1:34:38] thing that could drive that unclean
[1:34:39] spirit out of them
[1:34:41] and they could come up to the bases that
[1:34:43] they could be born again
[1:34:45] was the hearing that word and then what
[1:34:47] happened on death pentecost that word
[1:34:49] that they heard was
[1:34:50] made alive that's exactly what the new
[1:34:52] birth is in your soul
[1:34:54] that word you've taken in your soul and
[1:34:56] held on to
[1:34:57] look what david would have been if the
[1:34:58] holy ghost would have been there all
[1:35:00] right
[1:35:00] amen he said thy word have i hid in my
[1:35:03] heart
[1:35:04] that's what god loved about david david
[1:35:06] loved god's word
[1:35:08] that's right you don't love god's word
[1:35:10] you have to love god
[1:35:15] david had an honor and a church for that
[1:35:18] word that's right
[1:35:19] what if he had the holy ghost to follow
[1:35:20] him it would have been a great thing
[1:35:23] with brother bradham what is a new word
[1:35:25] it's a revelation of jesus christ
[1:35:27] personally to you
[1:35:30] amen that's why in the kingdom of god
[1:35:34] in the new testament it is not to a
[1:35:36] group of people
[1:35:38] it is to an individual that makes up a
[1:35:41] group then the body of christ
[1:35:44] see it's not whether mama say daddy's
[1:35:47] saved
[1:35:47] kids are saved who's saying it's whether
[1:35:49] or not you're saved
[1:35:51] right i like what
[1:35:55] joshua said for me and my house me first
[1:36:00] in my house we'll serve the lord well
[1:36:02] now
[1:36:03] me and my house is here
[1:36:06] i know what it means my home my family i
[1:36:08] know what that means that goes with it
[1:36:10] but for me and my house
[1:36:12] right we're going to serve the lord if
[1:36:14] my family don't serve the lord
[1:36:16] so i'm going to put it down in the right
[1:36:17] order all right now once
[1:36:20] but ryan said you say you're this you're
[1:36:22] that you're a lutheran that's bad that's
[1:36:24] what
[1:36:24] he snaps his fingers it's not even
[1:36:26] snappy finger right
[1:36:28] what is it is christ revealed and he
[1:36:31] is the word
[1:36:34] and when the word is revealed it
[1:36:36] expresses itself
[1:36:37] right what is the new birth the birth of
[1:36:40] the word
[1:36:43] and we'll get to it and i know this
[1:36:44] afternoon when i take this home but
[1:36:46] we'll get to it this evening that word
[1:36:48] that you hear
[1:36:50] the gary and i talk about me and you
[1:36:54] it took two years in me wanted brother
[1:36:57] gary
[1:36:59] for that word to drive that unclean
[1:37:01] spirit out
[1:37:04] all right
[1:37:07] now you tell me that it wasn't the word
[1:37:09] that jesus used against the unclean
[1:37:11] spirit that's right
[1:37:13] he never argued with him and flesh with
[1:37:15] him
[1:37:16] his temptation he didn't argue with the
[1:37:18] devil right he
[1:37:20] said it is written all right amen
[1:37:23] you never flush with nobody right see
[1:37:26] all i've ever tried to do is plant seed
[1:37:28] of the word all right amen right around
[1:37:31] said david had the word
[1:37:33] but he said he knocked the spirit of god
[1:37:35] to make it alive
[1:37:36] that's right what is it then
[1:37:41] that's christ's idea that's god's idea
[1:37:44] the new birth reveals this and if a man
[1:37:47] says he's born again
[1:37:49] and try to place these promises of
[1:37:51] christ in this last day
[1:37:52] to some other age making him
[1:37:56] christ yesterday but not today then that
[1:37:58] man or that person has been in a
[1:38:00] delusion by satan that's right
[1:38:06] what is the new verse brother christ
[1:38:08] revealed in you
[1:38:09] amen so it's christ expressing himself
[1:38:13] in the end in the individual whether
[1:38:16] he's
[1:38:16] intellectual or whether he don't know
[1:38:18] his abc's
[1:38:21] he goes on and explains the disciples
[1:38:24] didn't have any education
[1:38:25] right then what is the lies the new
[1:38:27] birth is christ
[1:38:28] is a revelation god has revealed to you
[1:38:32] this great mystery
[1:38:34] and that's the new verb
[1:38:38] first the mystery is you must be born
[1:38:40] again
[1:38:42] all right next is the threefold mystery
[1:38:44] that will carry you all the way to the
[1:38:46] chains of the body
[1:38:47] it's all a revelation all right one more
[1:38:49] thing
[1:38:51] look over and i put it 4a which is
[1:38:52] patma's vision you know what that one is
[1:38:55] but around preaching in 1960 1204
[1:38:59] evening service patmos vision
[1:39:02] he said now ask god to while we're
[1:39:05] talking on revelation
[1:39:08] ask him to give you a revelation of this
[1:39:11] for it can only be
[1:39:12] known by revelation and you can only be
[1:39:15] saved
[1:39:16] by revelation
[1:39:21] you have a knowledge of it
[1:39:23] intellectually
[1:39:25] but you can't be saved until it's
[1:39:27] revealed amen
[1:39:28] no man can call jesus the christ only by
[1:39:31] the holy ghost
[1:39:33] and you know what your prophet said no
[1:39:35] man can call jesus the christ without
[1:39:38] a personal experience of the new birth
[1:39:41] my nicodemus couldn't understand it it
[1:39:43] would take a personal experience what
[1:39:45] what about nicodemus standing there with
[1:39:47] all that word and the great life he was
[1:39:49] living
[1:39:52] he wouldn't even like david david was a
[1:39:54] murderer or a whoremonger he
[1:39:56] didn't ever playing the garbage can what
[1:39:58] about a man standing there not a mark
[1:39:59] against him
[1:40:00] and that word we need that new birth
[1:40:03] right
[1:40:07] the new birth is a revelation of jesus
[1:40:09] christ personally to you
[1:40:12] he said what was your experience brother
[1:40:15] dale
[1:40:16] i've told it over many times and remote
[1:40:19] would say brother dale i don't know what
[1:40:20] you're seeking i said i don't either
[1:40:22] because i don't even know anything about
[1:40:23] them trying to see
[1:40:26] but i'm not satisfied right
[1:40:30] one day in athens georgia he just looked
[1:40:32] right down at me and he said
[1:40:35] because he done told me before he said
[1:40:38] you quit seeking anything whatsoever i
[1:40:40] said i'm not doing it
[1:40:43] he said you accept jesus christ right
[1:40:46] he said because he is a person right
[1:40:50] and he's the person of the word amen
[1:40:54] right that was it
[1:40:58] that settled my whole experience of
[1:41:00] everything
[1:41:02] when christ began to deal with me
[1:41:04] personally
[1:41:06] i had seen many things been doing things
[1:41:09] sure read
[1:41:10] been in the message for two years but
[1:41:12] still
[1:41:14] i wouldn't like the people of this
[1:41:15] message say well i had to i had to have
[1:41:17] a new birthday i couldn't have come to
[1:41:18] the message
[1:41:19] now judas is carrick followed it a long
[1:41:22] time got a lot of things in there you
[1:41:25] know but
[1:41:26] you know that you're not gonna you're
[1:41:28] not gonna convince people you know why
[1:41:30] because they won't do as brother ronald
[1:41:32] said
[1:41:34] on souls in prison he said if he can get
[1:41:36] that soul to just stand still
[1:41:38] long enough
[1:41:43] you know what stand still means
[1:41:47] no no
[1:41:50] them disciples it took them three years
[1:41:52] and a half to learn what standing still
[1:41:54] was
[1:41:57] and you know what it was put up a room
[1:42:04] whereas i told you it's jesus a scene of
[1:42:06] over 500 brethren it says
[1:42:08] but 380 didn't make it to the upper room
[1:42:12] but 120 took the word and went up and
[1:42:14] said i am
[1:42:18] the new birth is the birth of the word
[1:42:20] amen
[1:42:22] now you can have all the words start out
[1:42:23] not having your birth because
[1:42:25] if they had it
[1:42:29] but now it couldn't come on him because
[1:42:33] jesus had died
[1:42:34] but we're in a different situation so
[1:42:37] don't
[1:42:38] play nicodemus you know well i'm just
[1:42:40] like nicodemus no we're not like
[1:42:42] nicodemus we're in a different age
[1:42:44] different time
[1:42:45] it's here amen if you want the holy
[1:42:48] ghost accept it
[1:42:50] well brother dale i haven't said that
[1:42:52] well keep accepting until it accepts you
[1:42:59] he says not whether you accepted him
[1:43:01] officers whether he accepted you
[1:43:03] but you know what he's dealing with we
[1:43:06] can fool even ourselves
[1:43:07] amen that's right we can make ourselves
[1:43:10] so hootie duty and religious and
[1:43:11] everything in the world
[1:43:17] i paved the parking lot
[1:43:20] you may want to pay the 12 000 it went
[1:43:23] we can't guarantee you eternal life but
[1:43:25] we will write you a receipt you can take
[1:43:27] off the income tax
[1:43:31] that's not being funny it's serious
[1:43:36] i was serious then and i just i saw that
[1:43:38] i've watched it all my life about people
[1:43:40] and what
[1:43:41] they've tried to do to save yourselves
[1:43:44] there's not one thing you can do to save
[1:43:46] yourself
[1:43:48] but if it was why did jesus die
[1:44:02] all we gotta do is accept him
[1:44:11] i've got a revelation all right
[1:44:15] you can have a revelation the little
[1:44:17] woman had a revelation that she touched
[1:44:18] him this garment i never gave her the
[1:44:20] new birth
[1:44:22] i've been through that with you there
[1:44:25] were plenty of people come to jesus
[1:44:27] that had a revelation was healed and all
[1:44:30] kind of
[1:44:31] that never gave him eternal life right
[1:44:33] amen
[1:44:34] that's right i believe everything
[1:44:36] brought around said amen
[1:44:40] but as paul said have you received the
[1:44:41] gift of the holy ghost since you believe
[1:44:43] yes that's right amen
[1:44:47] never stop seeking god
[1:44:50] until you find him and then when you do
[1:44:52] you'll never stop seeking him
[1:44:55] the second will be greater after you're
[1:44:57] born again
[1:44:59] than it was before that's right
[1:45:02] come on brother think on these things
[1:45:05] what is the new word the birth of the
[1:45:08] word
[1:45:08] amen
[1:45:11] the words you've taken what is the
[1:45:15] eternal life god's own life
[1:45:18] now listen listen now for a second
[1:45:21] please because i had a part was going to
[1:45:23] miss it and i've come back to it
[1:45:25] see we think that the new birth is like
[1:45:27] that the soul
[1:45:28] and eternal life just and forgive me for
[1:45:31] using the word
[1:45:32] it just zaps it
[1:45:36] is that what you think the new birth is
[1:45:37] is that what you think i'm talking about
[1:45:39] like your soul is like this bible i'm
[1:45:41] holding and that's your soul
[1:45:43] and then god just zaps it
[1:45:47] no his own life
[1:45:51] comes in you
[1:45:55] soul to soul his own life comes into you
[1:45:58] that's right
[1:45:59] it's not just him giving eternal life
[1:46:04] to the soul
[1:46:07] the soul is made eternal by his presence
[1:46:16] his presence coming and living in you
[1:46:22] think on these things 5 39.
[1:46:28] let's stand together anybody have a need
[1:46:52] god
[1:47:20] brothers
[1:47:29] unto me
[1:47:48] inside of you
[1:47:57] no matter how sinful they are that you
[1:47:59] can't see their sin
[1:48:05] you've never had an experience until you
[1:48:07] do that
[1:48:10] stop condemning
[1:48:14] you've ever had an experience of
[1:48:16] standing safe
[1:48:30] person inside of there coming out
[1:48:37] you never experienced something like
[1:48:39] that you don't know what to do
[1:48:43] we need to stand say
[1:48:46] and let that one inside of you
[1:48:50] say you're healed
[1:48:57] then there's no problem about the
[1:48:58] healing
[1:49:00] there's no problem about the salvation
[1:49:02] for your family your children
[1:49:07] we love them and we want to do
[1:49:08] everything we can to try to save our
[1:49:10] children right amen
[1:49:11] and we do that but living reform is the
[1:49:13] greatest of all
[1:49:17] alive before them in christ
[1:49:21] but if it's ever been quicker than you
[1:49:22] might die
[1:49:26] and the lord tell you something
[1:49:29] then you know what a revelation
[1:49:33] then he went around and said i don't
[1:49:35] care if the world he said if god told me
[1:49:37] to go right george washington
[1:49:39] he said i'd invite the world to go
[1:49:46] pray until that inward man
[1:50:08] is
[1:50:36] oh
[1:50:50] me
[1:50:58] the joy of thy salvation
[1:51:06] within me
[1:51:22] within me
[1:51:39] within me out of the way
[1:51:56] from memphis
[1:52:04] the joy of my salvation
[1:52:10] and renew my spirit within me
