in prayer dear heavenly father thank you for the day you've give us thank you for the time set aside Lord every Sunday Lord to hear from you and hear words of encouragement father and and sometimes maybe they cut a little bit but they're still Words of Love encouragement from from you Lord and with your tender hand Lord you're leading us as a as a wonderful Shepherd father you're leading Us by the Holy Spirit to these different places the higher higher Heights Lord and and a level that that man has not reached that even Martin Luther and John Wesley didn't reach these Heights Lord in the word of God that we're standing here today Lord the last final voice to the final age they'll never hear your voice a gentile will never hear your voice again once we're out of here and father we pray that everyone under the sound of my voice Lord does a little bit of checking up just look down deep and don't look at your neighbor or your wife or your husband look deep down inside of ourself and see how we're doing do a little checkup every once in a while that's why we go to the doctor once a year sometimes is we get a little checkup to make sure everything's good and working right and all these different things and if not then we get a little adjustment Lord and I pray that you'll adjust us all father that we'll grow more in you that we'll be more content that we'll be more patient and Lord that we'll give you the praise and honor and Glory because we can't do it by oursel we got to have you and father I pray you'd bless the ones that are sick Lord ones that are traveling bless them in Jesus name amen if you do a good job for others you heal yourself at the same time because a dose of joy is a spiritual cure it transcends all barriers on Amen if you do a good job for others you heal yourself at the same time because a dose of joy is a spiritual cure it transcends all barriers you know who said that Ed Sullivan everybody remember Ed he did have some words of wisdom but that's true Revelations 1:10 I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day heard behind me a great voice of the trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last what thou seest write in a book and send it to the seven churches and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks we'll get into those in a little bit under sanctification and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one liken to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G it by to paps with a golden girdle you may be seated and we'll turn to Revelations 3:7 we'll continue our thought from this morning to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write these things said he that is Holy he that is true now the who you talking about Jesus Christ but if you are a part of Jesus Christ listen when brother Brown says the the scriptures that speaks of the bridegroom also speaks of the Bride when are we going to put those two together when we going to put those together just like I said today Jesus said love your enemies pray for those that despise are we doing that if we're not doing that then we're not lost we just don't we just don't have a piece of the puzzle together yet don't get quiet there's something lacking in our life if we can't be more kind than we are right to our enemies people that hate you that's right it's time for us to either get together or or or we're never going to make it this is the age of Brotherly Love right this Philadelphia age is the age of Brotherly Love what's going to do that it's going to be a Sanctified life it's going to take your well now if Brother Don live a Sanctified life that'll help me it might but probably not it just might be easier to say he's my friend but why about loving somebody that just literally don't even like to be in a room with you I have a few million of them Revelations 3:7 don't everybody go out the door to the angel of the church in Philadelphia right these things sayi he that is Holy he that is true like he wasn't it wasn't a point when God wasn't true but as I said before it's a higher order of a Revelations 3:14 says a faithful and true witness not like it was a false witness it was true in other words it rign true it was all true and nothing else like I said before the tuning fork you know you hit that tuning fork if it says see that that's the standard well God is a standard he faithful and true witness you hit that Hey listen hit that thing every once in a while and see why it rings see if it rings back to you it's either an amen or an O me one of the two he that hath the Key of David and he that openeth and no man shutteth now look this is where we're we're looking at where we see the seals he open them no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth because like I said before it means something that when when you get sealed in with the Holy Ghost God's the one that seals you yes it's God himself no one else the pastor can't do it the preacher can't do it your neighbor can't do it your wife can't do it your husband can't do it God has to seal that Holy Ghost inside your soul Satan's not going to do it for sure he's going to actually do the dodging thing and he's going to try to get crawl under his leg and around the corner and try to get in before God does but he can't that's right so there you are you have a piece of God inside of you he opens you up puts itself inside and closes you right back up but while you're in there as we're going to talk in the New Birth when we look at the holy of holies it was a priest in God and that was it second Court you can Mill around and they make the shoe bread and they they make the 12 Loaves and the priest go in there and eat it and they light the candles and they do all these different things inside of that but when you into that holy of holies that priest had to walk right by them and he walked right into that holy of holies no one else but that one person so it's it's it is a personal experience between you and God it is not a collective experience amen amen I Know Thy Works behold I have set before thee in opened door and no man can shut it and I remember the open door was to the world to to missionary I'll read it in just a minute I skipped it this morning no man can shut it for thou Hast a little strength and H has kept my word see I have a little strength in this age we're supposed to have full strength we've called We're called for the fullness not part that's the fullness of the godhead B is in the bride you read that right there behind you on that on that wall that's been there forever the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in his church or the bride I'm reading it off of the wall back there but it's on um Christ is a mystery of God revealed when we going to start realizing that that we are um I think the next ministers meeting they talk about is is the bride a part of The Headstone she is The Headstone the son of man is The Headstone well where is the son of man supposed to be revealed in a bride yes all right so she is collectively then now the fullness of the godhead bodily not in one person it was in Jesus Christ he he didn't he wasn't part of The Headstone he was The Headstone all right he and he's supposed to come back in the end time to what be in a bride a many membered body that's going to come together not all not all there's some not going to come to that fullness you got to decide whether you want to or not right cuz I promise you in this church you've heard it over the years and there's no excuse except your excuse okay I just I depend on that you know there's a bar set there's there's a bar set at different places like when Abby and different ones or where's Abby oh helping Josh when you're in school there's a bar set right you have to meet certain curriculum you have to meet a certain standard to get to another grade or you have to do that what is it a test and then you she took a SAT and you got different you got different things that you take to go to different places all right so that's the same way with the word of God there's a standard the first church age was required a certain amount of word right second was not required to First third was not required to Second fourth was not required to third but that first church age and the last Church age is supposed to be the bar setting up here all right and then and we get plus because there's no other Church aids to throw it back to we've got to come to the fullness and then we send it to the Jews so I mean we're a little more we're supposed to be a little more advanced what I mean than we than any other Church age when the seals open that did not open to nobody but Jesus himself while he was on the face of the Earth okay and then I believe it shut back up when he left cuz it didn't come back to the end time did it right they didn't even nobody proat at all much Paul never spoke of it he should have spoke of it I I know he preached them but he preached them in his way cuz when we get scriptures for the seals you go and you read what Paul wrote different things about The Headstone and all that he knew who it was but he said I look through a glass Darkly in other words I feel a pull I know it's pulling me toward that but I don't know how to get there I know it's pulling me but remember Paul says it's not my time the only thing he says the time of my departure is at hand right but he did not have the fullness he did not have the seals open in his ministry but we did see that with brother brandom the seals opened and then God allowed us to go into the mind of God and see understand not see with our eyes but understand that we're supposed to be different that's why I saying this morning we should be different to begin with people should know you're a Christian you should know that when the the um the black sisters there are standing outside with their dresses on their long hair you're different now they may not like it they may persecute you but they know you're different that's why we're supposed to be a separated group we're supposed to be different we're supposed to be different you know why Jesus was different they hated him the religious World hated Jesus Christ the other ones did not the Beggars didn't hate him Common People heard him gladly he was around all these 5,000 and 4,000 and 6,000 and 10,000 and all these people and they just loved him but when he walked in that Temple they hated him that's right and the Bible says they hated him without a cause there was no cause they should have hated that man he came exactly the way the scripture said he was supposed to come and they hated him anyway and that's what he going to say way with me and you we are coming the way the scripture told us that we were coming yes the bride in the end time is coming exactly the way the scripture say exactly the way Jesus said that this is what we're looking at right now when he preached the seals what he preached he preached about us beware false Christ there's going to come this there's going to come wars and rumors of wars there's going to be all these different things that know what he said he preached the seals in Matthew amen we just had a prophet to come and tear the seal back show us what was going on and then inside of you it sealed back up I love that because remember when it's sealed up it's you and God absolutely the problem is is we've had a lot of people in the end time and the message of the hour they let a third person in that room they didn't get all the way shut in they left the crack and that's where the where Satan remember brother R said Satan crawled under the gates of of Eve of Eden right he come in he come into to uh God's Eden and made it Satan's Eden well guess what we're s here in Satan's Eden and God's making an Eden again out of a group of people hid so much the world don't know anything about it the like I said the world thinks we're crazy they think we're a cult right brother Andre head this past weekend uh sister Regina I asked him to give about a that much of a testimony the you know read or digest version not the War and Peace version he met a man one time when he got out of the army marines sorry but thank you that was quick he got out of the Marines anyway okay okay okay brother Donnie okay all right don't pull out a sword um so when he got out of the Marines he wanted to be a ham radio operator you know what a ham you know what a ham radio is some of you don't you kids are like what in the world's that well anyway it's a private thing inside your home that you can talk to people before cell phones and all that okay this was back in the early '90s so anyway brother Andre found a place that was look it up Google ham radio they still got them now do you know that the US government uses that as a backup yes sir they use they don't use cell phones they use ham radio operators as a backup if you'll get in these ham radio clubs they got different um they got like a n that goes out and they can talk to each other and communicate if everything else has been shut down they can communicate dad used to have a two-way or CB Radio and all that different things but anyway so brother Andre is want to do that of course he's Andre head the center back then he what he said yeah he was Andre the center not Andre the Giant he never has been Andre the Giant Andre the center and he said he wanted to be a ham radio operator when a God who impressed him to do that it had to be God because you know who he sent it to there was a man and Alabama named Hugh beam some of you older ones know who Hugh beam was I now some of the younger ones probably never met him wonderful guy wonderful message believer big old tall guy you know about this tall and and I mean he was he was um imposing um and sister be I guess is still alive but he's passed on but anyway he was a ham radio operator so guess what class Andre got in Andre the center got in his class well he's teaching this class of ham radio well all of a sudden Andre is going to the class going to the class going to the class and all of a sudden Hub beam disappears from the from the school well where's where's Mr Beam where where's Mr Beam at well they had to let him go had to let him go said yeah we found out he was in a cult he was a message believer and he had talked to a few people about the message of hour he never say anything to Andre about it so what does Andre do he goes and finds Hub beam and finds him and he teaches him inside I believe it is right he he's watching in so he'll he'll know I'm if I'm telling the truth or not he can send me a message but I believe he went to Brother Hub beam's house to fin he wanted to be a ham radio operator he didn't care a thing about the message he said I didn't care about all that stuff I wanted to learn how to be a radio operator and brother Hugh was a good one so to see how God works he went there well he goes there and he goes in brother Hugh's house and he says well who's that well you know who he was pointing to the picture of brother random with the halo over his head well then he starts well to make a long story short you see where brother Andre is at now because of that because of brother huban being kicked out from being a cult it separated him to a place to where what the seed could find him the seed could find him and went to him and you see what happens now he's a pastor there at the church you see how the Providence of God so if you if you're called a cult and kicked out and fired look around something fixing to happen I don't care they can call me whatever they want to but they're not going to call you Christian because like brother Bob said CH the word Christian's been so eroded in the end time just to say you know Jesus you're a Christian don't matter what you wear no matter if you ever go to church or not no matter what anything you're just like the world well we need to be separated from the world all right let's continue on is everybody all right so the the church ages slow down brother Ain you supposed to say slow down a minute so we've got the church ages we were explaining this morning about the black was the with the darkness of Satan the doctrine that Satan had and then you see the light and then you see that we're heading toward now I want you to get ready cuz like next week or the week out well three weeks from now we'll be getting over into the age of the Holy Ghost remember there was a age of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell at 830 on the 120 in the upper room that that was the beginning of Paul stepping into the ministry of the Gentiles everybody all right with that right and what's going to now remember this is Alpha if this is Alpha this is Omega they got got be the same right so this this started with a Pentecostal experience this has a Pentecostal experience in here that's going to carry us into the message of the hour and we'll talk about that a little bit later all right so is everybody good with that mirror image if it started with that it's got to end with that all right so now and remember that all of it has to do with a church a dominating female just remember brothers and sisters see we can be that a dominating female we're bride or we're supposed to be bride we don't want headship over our lord Jesus no we don't that's what we get in trouble with a lot of times we try to assert oursel over what what our head says and he'll put us back in line but there was a dominating female that he knew would be in those Church ages that would formulate doctrines that were not true and guess what I was thinking about this yesterday or day before yesterday you know brother rown said our age is the age of a woman right 13th 13 colonies and all Revelations 13 woman's one well remember it started way back over here that's right amen listen it's always been go look in them Dark Ages there were queens that started Wars there was queens that had affair with this one that started a war there was a queen queen queen queen woman woman woman woman woman woman all the way down through till the end time it's going to culminate between a true bride and a false bride it'll be the true and the false is the only two's going to be standing at the end time and one's going to Prevail over the other and we just sure know that God's bride is going to Prevail over everything that Satan throws at us all right so let's not be so dominating or Domina ing when the Lord tells us to do something we need to do it and do it with joy do it with peace in our heart to know that he does not make a mistake we do he doesn't all right and every move he makes whether we question it or not every move he makes is perfect absolutely he can't make a mistake listen I have to put my dependency on and when I put my dependency on that I really don't look at circumstances and you'll quit looking at circumstances if you'll do that now look that word if is a big word if you're a bride if you're a child of God now if you're not a child of God there you in a whole different ball game you're in a whole different world but if you're the Bride of Jesus Christ you know you're the bride you know God sealed you in and you have troubles trials and tribulations it is for your good it is not for your detriment it God has never never made anybody sad think about that a God didn't make you sad that's why I love brother random he said folks he said why would God send his bride through the tribulation why would you send your wife through tribulation no he's not he's going to bring the bride out the church is going to go through tribulation but the bride will not go through tribulation everybody with Meen so we look at the seals and we see that we're going to get into the seals a little bit more what we're going to do when we get to brother brandham when we get to the last message of the hour which was not all of brother Brown's message I like what somebody said who's Malachi for we're Malachi for we are Maliki 4 we are the he's going to send you Elijah the prophet so he sent the message to me I don't know about you but he sent it to me all right he sent that Elijah to me cuz when I hear that voice or heard that voice it was different right something different about it I and it was something that rign true so there's a a Ministry has been loosed all down from the first church age all the way down to us there's been Ministry loosed a true and a false always remember he said Beware of what false Christ amen that's right not false bums false Christ false somebody that knows a little bit right right cuz what is Christ an anointed one okay that's why you can have anointed ones you can have false Christ that's what the Bible says right all right so there's a Ministry loose that's why we are so like I said uh last week or week before or even Tennessee I can't remember they all run together we got to have a Doctrine you got to have a Doctrine in your church brother R said a do a church without a Doctrine is not a church so we have a doctrine of progressive revelation we have a doctrine that that we see that God is moving we we we we still preach on hair and dress we still preach on like I said this morning but we weave it into where tomorrow is something for you to chew on it's something for you to eat like Paul like um John ate the book right it's something to nourish you and help you grow in God not that God sent a prophet and that's about all we got but he said I will restore so he's restoring to its fullness right now right now it's not coming because remember Pentecost was the shook what is the shook all right if this is seed all right look if this is seed this is the TR this is what went into the ground this is what you planted all right you won't ever see this again until it goes to maturity this one died rotted but the life of it came up through here went all the way out and there was a there was a carrier or something to protect that seed right and that's called Pentecost that's why they had a Pentecostal blessing to begin with and that's why we got a Pentecostal blessing that we had to come through all of us yes I don't care if you were Baptist Methodist or or whatever you had a Pentecostal blessing all right but remember that Pentecostal blessing without putting that in your soul like brother Brown said you just tooted out the horn to that toot the whistle this is what we're looking for we're looking for what went in the ground so who went in the ground Jesus Christ this cap Jesus went in the ground Jesus resurrected he disappeared remember he disappeared because he went in the ground in the fourth Church age he disappeared but he come up his two shoots listen those two shoots was Jesus Christ right regardless of what you think the life that was in that seed was in those two little shoes then it was in that stock then it was in at one time it was in the the tassel or or the or the ear the corn you know you don't eat that you don't eat that thing around the corn you pull that off it's called shuck but what does That Shook do once you once you pull that Shu back and Sun hits that it dries it up and if it's not mature never come up but if it matures inside that you break it off you shook it and then you can eat it all right or you can dry it out and you can plant it again you can't this corn now cuz it's hybrid but you used to be able to you could plant corn and it would come back up but that's what Jesus said I will restore so he's not just restoring us back sure he's bringing us through justification he's bringing us through sanctification the stalk and the and the tassle coming out to the baptism of the Holy Ghost but remember it's got to go into the full grain in the end time that's what we're going to get into when we get into this last Church age it is going to be full seed grain he had listen he's done what he said he was going to do I will restore you and I are in that period of time right now right I'll restore all those years backward I'll ReStore in other words like I said one of the one of the um translations was I will I will get all that time and I'll bring it right back to me and you all that time that he left this happen and that happened and this happened and that happened he's bringing us to a time of full restoration and I believe we're in that full restoration time there will be nothing left but seed there'll be no shook left shook dries up blows away I watched them do U uh watched a YouTube video of of uh doing a wheat in the you remember the threshing floor Boaz and them had a threshing floor the the shuck still around that little bit of wheat you know wheat grows out like this there's hundreds of them on that he'd take that big old thing and he' stick his he stick it look like a broom almost or a pitchfork he stick in there he'd throw it up in the air well guess what all that red shuck would go floating through the wind and the seed would fall right back down where it's supposed to be that's what God was talking about taking you to the threshing floor getting rid of all that stuff that's around you that's holding you back it holds all of us back you ought to look that up sometime it's really interesting I mean you got all these things now where they can where they can uh you know Josh's got a a 3D printer where you make anything in the world still over in the foreign countries they stick the Pitchfork in they throw the stuff up in the air and there goes the there goes the shuck and the wheat falls down on the ground so you know why because God said that's what would happen he takes us to the threshing floor he divides us he lets the wind sometimes the Winds of War or the Winds of Doctrine blow all that out of the way and the true seed's going to hit the ground you and I are that true seed believe that please believe that there is no other I ain't saying Ain't No Other church I ain't saying no other Ministry I'm just saying this is it yes right there's no other message this message none but the first three ages they had the pure word fourth age went in the ground as we've just discussed and we know that I just explained every bit of that so we don't have to go through it but the fifth Age come out of there not looking like the seed but it was part of it the life that was in this seed came up to two shoes justification reform reforming back it did start restoration though y'all know that right it was not restoration but it started the restoration of the word back into Power cuz it had lost its power during that middle age but the fifth age got a little bit of light the sixth age a little bit of light a little bit more light but in our age remember it was completely dark but that little light brother Brandon put in there as I said this morning that's literally me and you the ones that take this message and carry it on to the coming of the Lord that's that white piece that's on that on that chart amen that's me and you somebody's going to carry it somebody's going to do it I just dumb enough to believe I can do it with God's help it's not me it's him but what do we got to do we got to yield let him throw us up in the air let him throw us up in the air and let the drunk fall out justification remember that eradicates by faith in what Christ did at the cross that was what was under Martin Luther his time of justification he believed that the blood of Jesus Christ had power see they didn't believe it in the Middle Ages no they believe the pope had the power they believe the Catholic church had the power they believe they uh Constantine and all the different ones they had the power but Luther says no the just shall live by faith the power of the blood of God is enough to cover me and take my sins away and God said that ain't nothing but the truth that's what I wanted you to say you just keep saying that until the next group comes up which is sanctification all the past sins are chopped off you're starting a new Journey you're starting a new way of life but you still got that old thing nagging on you right but we're coming to a place where it's going to be taken away the Bible tells us those who he's Justified he's what he's already glorified if he truly Justified you he will put you in a glorified body come on if he truly Justified you he justified you and you believe that you've been truly Justified like brother Brown said you'll know then the real you didn't do it we'll get to that when we get into the seals and all over in when brother Brown's uh message you'll see I hope you see that who he justified he already glorified through the Redemption that is in Christ to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed so justification one word picks up the jar all right I'm going to use that nothing else still dirty nothing else it's just changed position everybody with me it's just changed position I I didn't want to stay down here anymore so God said okay buddy I'm going to use you if you'll let me but it's dirty he can't start drinking it he wants to drink out of it that's what he picked it up he had a purpose for it and he was listen if God don't make a mistake he was just in picking it up everybody with me therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the Deeds of the law so there was no law could put you right here in the Old Testament there was no law that could take you out of the muck you were in and start you on a journey to the New Birth not in the Old Testament got the blood of bulls and goats now it covered it it covered sin and then at Calvary it eradicated it but it didn't eradicate it at that time cuz it it had no life in it it had it had lamb life or or goat or heer it had that life that life can't come back in you and make you clean am it took somebody yes a man it took God amen they took the blood of God the life that was in the blood of God that we believe he was God he was not a second person and the life that was in that blood that he gave at Calvary that life came back into the believer the literal blood didn't come on but the life that was in that blood so you had to believe that's why cus could look at him and say well he said he could save many but he can't even save himself well he's going to say that in Hell one day and he's going to figure out if he had said something different he wouldn't be where he was at he said he could save others but he can't even save himself what a Blasphemous thing to say from the head of the religious order of the day right the head of the religious order of the day made that statement about Jesus so what's going to kill us what kills us religion religion is what kills us it is so justification we were looking at this morning inside of that box or that little shelter which is covered with we can get into that but we're not all kind of different colors Badger skin hid behind skin that's why God put Badger skin on that thing okay it's got cloth we may break it down later on if the Lord teares next year this is cloth but when you get over here it's Badger skin it's clothed it's got skin on it and they put layer on top of layer because when it rained they didn't want it to to get inside that thing they made it waterproof in their day we can't hardly do that in our day with all this technology we got but in that second Court you look you can't see anything you're out here you're out here in the world and then all of a sudden you come into this condition that you want to be saved you want to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ all right you got to go through the labyr you got to go through the what sacrifice you got to make a sacrifice you come all the way to right here but now when you get right here a different a different part of you has to go inside there everybody with me sir because remember your soul in justification your Soul's not born again your soul is still black right all right so when you become Sanctified when you pull that apart I wish that would do with everybody brother I appreciate that that's what I've been needing somebody with some excitement about the word of God but but when you open I mean when the priest went in there not everybody could go even though you listen even though you made a sacrifice there's a lot of people throw the sacrifice on here had it had their sins covered for the Year this is back in an old Testament and they walk right back out guess what where they went back to the world and the things of the world right if you love the world and the things of the world the love of the father is not even in you but if you go keep walking and you consecrate yourself we're going to talk about this in just a minute why David could do what he did and not really break the law watch so you get right here there's a curtain so you don't know what goes on behind here and here this only does what's inside and I don't know what you're thinking right now praise God am yeah say Amen again there I don't I don't want to know what you're thinking right now but you should be thinking on the things of God but I don't know how your soul is I can't see your soul but I can see an outward expression of whatever that is right so we look in the outer Court that's the that's the justification you come in you get to go through that do like I said all the sacrifices the washing of the of the uh sprinkling of the water and the blood and all that and you're heading toward something but you can't see what it is you only heard a rumor what went on inside that's right amen a preacher may have told you how to get here but if he ain't been in here self and seen that room he can't explain it to you if he hadn't been here he can't explain any of this that's right that's why we believe in a pre progressive revelation we believe in moving through that's right that Temple because remember that Temple is now you that right there is a symbol of you but it's also a symbol of who huh what brother R say Moses God took Moses to heaven right and showed him Jesus Christ he came back and that's what he did cuz that's the only way he explain Jesus is a body a spirit and a soul but guess what praise God you and I can explain that and live it and this be the Temple of the Holy Ghost not just what not just a um you know that thing's gone that thing's gone I reading yesterday they think they found the ark well okay that's all right the real one and like Dad said they went to Jerusalem in 1995 and they said it was underneath the mosque of Omar it could be there that's okay with me but see to me and you that's that's not anything to us but it is to them listen if they can get that thing right there back together again they think God's coming they think their Messiah will show up he will come down in that cloud as a person and save Israel well guess what he's going to come down in a person to save Israel two of them Called Moses and Elijah and the message of the hour is going to them from us it's going to transfer there and they're going to go hey look you don't need this wall you don't need this you don't need that you don't need a a real Ark sitting here you are the ark the Ark of the Covenant you've been looking for listen the Ark of the Covenant you've been looking for for 2,000 years had been walking around in a gentile bride that's how important you are to God CU that's what them two witness are going to say they're going to say you don't need this Hallelujah let God come inside of [Music] you and they're going to go we wasted all these years trying to get the temple together and they're trying now they're trying everything in the world they say now they got like a thousand red heers cuz see you got to sacrifice them but they say they're here in America somewhere because of um artificial insemination all these different things they've broke it down where they've got a thousand of them stuck away somewhere that's okay with me we've already had our red heer we've already had our water of Separation if you're born again today you have been separated from the world you don't need the ashes of a heer Paul explains big time he explains if we need that we're in trouble that's right if the if remember if the ashes of sprinkling of the ashes of the heer made the worshipper clean then yes in other words at Paul's time I mean there he watched them go through the temple and he's like come on people God ain't there no more he left that place and an 70 when Titus came he of course now he didn't take that that was in the wilderness the one that they built Solomon's Temple they totally destroyed it t it to Pieces right tore it down Jesus said they would that's right he said there will not be one stone left on another They Carried the ark They Carried a manora They Carried all these different things and Rome's got it right now amen that's why the Jews will make a pack with Rome right that's why the pope will say I got your stuff you need if you'll sign this little contract right here I'll give you your stuff back but we see though that that's carnal that's carnal they don't need that you're going to see two witnesses show up over there that's going to say y'all didn't need to sign this contract Jesus has already come and that's why they're going to hate him and I believe the 144 4,000 are going to be killed by their own Brethren not by the United States or by Russia we don't care a Jew ha a Jew he'll kill him so anyway so now let's get started with the sanctification here real quick so the sixth Church age was love of the Brethren I know th Works behold I set before thee an Open Door no man can shut it thou Hast a little strength and kept my word and Hast not denied my name so little strength to me adds up to it is also then another unfulfilled age just like it was in Luther's time all right John Wesley was the church age messenger he once remarked that he did not fear that the name of Methodist would leave the Earth but that the spirit might take his flight and absolutely that has come true the Methodist Church you know they've they've split you got the United that lets gays and women and all the different ones then you got this other part that that that we're we're associated with some of them in our in our community and um sometimes they don't know what to do am they don't know what to do because because big church has pulled everything out they got to live on their own money some of them had to buy the churches they didn't know the Methodist Church owned it so they had to buy their own churches from the Methodist Church which makes them Rich guess what they're going to do they going to give it to Mama cuz they're just daughters but they're going to give it to Mama which is the pope or the Catholic Church whichever one you want to say now he that openeth and no man shutteth and shut and no man openeth in the Philadelphian Church age brother Brown said now the great missionary age brotherly love the age of missions how do you put those two together let me ask you a question how you put those two together it was the it was the agape love that those Messengers had for the people that didn't never heard had never heard of Jesus Christ that's why we in this church go to different places or send people it's not that we want to go and have our um I hope it's not that we that we want to go and have our passport stamped Jamaica Philippines Nicaragua Honduras I've been there I've been to Jamaica 11 times time I'd go back tomorrow but that don't mean nothing to me there they become my very very good friends but I went over there because I loved them went over there to help them did more good at the the second time we went to uh the Philippines instead of traveling all over the island and wearing yourself out preaching yeah I'm getting older we brought all the ministers together in one place and this church paid for the meal and paid for the day at the place and there was like 60 ministers there and we talked about the seals we talked about all the different things the Daniel 70 weeks and they said they learn more because you know what if you can get a minister to understand what's going on he can go to his congregation and preach it for years or months I can go preach one time and they oh great Americans here yeah we had brother on and so what he preach I don't know but boy we had a good time right that's what happened there the missionary what did Paul do what was Paul's missionary what was his um I guess his Forte brother R told us he'd go to a place he'd stay there for two or three months he would establish people or me ministers in that part of the world or country and then he would leave so he got those people in the right on the right track and then they took it to the people cuz you know I mean you take go to places that didn't have a you don't have to interpret her in Jamaica well I probably did but uh in the Philippines the different ones and y'all went to Honduras and you have to wait for The Interpreter just like we're doing now which is fine but in in we were talking about it today in in languages there's different interpretations you know that there's different interpretations but when I'm an American and you're an American at least you might know what I'm saying I may be speaking a different language than y'all are but being a southerner but you know what I'm saying so the if the if the minister that speaks their language doesn't need an interpreter and he goes to his church and he preaches what God gives him to the people way more impact the Meagle in there somebody interpreting maybe don't get it wrong but may get a different interpretation out of it and then I'm gone are the ministers gone and they're all sitting there going what'd he say I don't understand what he's saying and without the Holy Ghost the person interpret it may tell them something different it's how a lot of doctrines get started so what did God do God sent missionaries to different parts of the world through John Wesley George Whitfield Charles fny Dwight Moody William KY David Livingston all the different ones in South Africa because why I got names of plenty of them here great men that lived in that brotherly love black man white man brown man yellow man all walls were broke down and these men went into the mission Fields Brotherly Love stretching out a hand to All Nations everywhere and it was open to them that they could go so God gives a time to where look now look before another Open Door age cuz they couldn't before that they couldn't have done it the papacy are the Rome had people so bound down till nobody was going to listen well are you Roman Catholic no I'm not well I'm not listening to you but God broke that door open and God went through that door with and in those missionaries they had it so closed up that they couldn't go in but in that age the doors were open cuz he said it was an Open Door age they opened up many doors during that age the door to the gospel the door to the mission field the door back to Christ and everything was opened up during that age and you can see what they did the Brethren done a great job out of it now remember we're talking about sanctification so what did they do if you come to that outer Court you had to enter into that next Veil right it had to open so you could step in it then it closed behind you all right we read that this morning Luther was the was the little grain of seed Luther stood out it was justification he was the very type of Hagar the stalk Wesley Sarah the Philadelphian age of love that brought forth the tassel then Wesley's age there was more missionaries than any other we've ever seen great missionary age of John Wesley but Pentecost represented Mary now we'll get to that later on like I said Mary the last stage of it now she was not the seed and and I want to ask these people these Seed doctrine people I want to ask them one question did Mary come with a seed in her she had to receive seed if you married today did your wife had kids she already had the seed in her she had to receive seed but look yet the life of the seed was in her but it hadn't matured yet oh I feel very religious it hadn't matured yet it was there but it wasn't matured in other words Jesus so it is with our Pentecostal age that we're living in now they probably didn't like him saying that what he's saying was is they hadn't matured what Pentecostal were what babbling babies cuz remember the the commission was to turn the hearts of the children back to the adults all right children to fathers is everybody with me babbling Pentecostal babies that thought this was it there's nothing else but this this is all we got to have and we're going inter WAP brother R said you don't ain't got started yet he said you latter rain people you had even had a former rain yet he was sewing to former rain himself you and I are the Harvest rain you and I I are if there's not a harvest it didn't get planted right CU if God plants a seed it always will come up always it will come up nothing will stop it that's right Satan can try to give you dry God will give you rain we may go through a dry time every once in a while but God's going to give you rain if you'll ask for it Pray For Rain let's pray for rain amen let's pray for the Harvest rain to get us out of here cuz I see mature seed coming up I see people coming back to the maturity they're supposed to be but now remember sanctification is a process justification but sanctification when you go inside there we'll explain it in just a second if you'll give me if you'll just give me a few more minutes become more holy Through Time listen I don't expect you young Christians to be fully matured my dad didn't either he nurtured everybody he could he'd nurture them he knew when they get born like sister Cindy different ones had so much wisdom not to run them off okay and I pray that that wisdom stays here we don't run them off that we know that we are kids and when we have kids we identify them as kids but we know that they're potential adults right the only person can stop you is what you you quit eating there's nothing nobody can do that's right you stop eating you become anorexic and you die yes let me just put it blunt that's right if you're if you even a Christian a come on now Brothers you you can you can come right down there that pyramid and you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and you can still starve to death if you want to do that you remember the brother that that that brother Bri said he said I was't going to preach no more I'm going to drink my beer and that brother Ramsey I believe it was he quit he quit going up the statue of perfect man he quit he quit on God but God didn't quit on him he was a child of God brother R said God took his child home yes to not Mar his name what a great God you say well that looked bad no to me that was the greatest thing he could have ever done for that man took him on home before he done something really bad to anybody around him got drunk and killed somebody on the road or whatever but we become more holy through time that's why I said age listen human age doesn't mean anything to God you can be 90 years old and be a baby in God right but you can be 16 years old and got under the right Fountain got under the right Ministry and got under the right teaching and got yourself in the right place and you can be a mature person look at look at Paul and Timothy and different ones he he matured Timothy up to a place to where he depended on Timothy to do things right amen called him his son in the gospel well only a father can mature the son though he was maturing him up so like a child growing up into adulthood Christians become more Sanctified over time first Peter 2 we've read it many many many times this means that Christians should expect to make progress to grow that's why they called it Pilgrim's Progress I guess to grow and become more loving look more loving more kind more humble and self-controlled over their lifetime that Jesus said how you going to do this sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth now watch I didn't read this this morning so in questions and answers they asked brother brandom what's the difference in the Holy Ghost and and in U and being a um saved I guess it was so the Holy Spirit look you are believing unto eternal life life all right Shake Yourself just for a minute but when the Holy Ghost comes it is eternal life all right you reading it it is eternal life you're believing unto you're begotten of the spirit at sanctification begotten not born begotten of the spirit at sanctification come on see give me some more of that y'all got some more of them you know sometimes honestly we're we're human beings we've heard this for 50 years and it just ain't it's just common but when you get somebody comes in that that really sees it am that's the reaction you get I'm not shaming anybody I'm just telling you sometimes we think oh it's just common we've heard this before how many times have we heard about justification how many times have we heard about sanctification well if you'll get it I'll quit preaching about it amen amen you know what brother R said he said you know Faith he said when they start having faith he said I'll quit preaching on faith you're begotten of the spirit at sanctification but never born of the spirit until the Holy Ghost comes in right sanctification is a wonderful place to be but it's also a hard place to be cuz Satan can still come back in with his with his spirits fill you back up with him again and make you religious make you believe the message cry when you sing cry when brother Brandon preaches cry when everybody preaches and cry here and cry there then you cry yourself right back out in the world that's correct a baby's got life you know what I thought about this now brother bradam is a master physician right remember he could tell people cancer is a bruised cell now who in the world Mayo never came up with that right brother brand knew all that why cuz he was a prophet amen watch what he says that's correct a baby's got life in the womb of the mother little muscles are quivering it's a life are you are you reading that it's a life but it's a different life when it breathes the breath of life into its nostrils it's a different wow right that's what it is my dear Methodist brother Pilgrim Holiness Nazarene the baptism of the Holy Ghost is different from sanctification sanctification is the cleansing which is preparation of life but when the Holy Ghost comes it is life preparation is cleaning the vessel right the Holy Ghost is filling the vessel sanctification mean clean and set aside for service the holy spirit is put it a holy spirit is put it in service you are the vessel that God's cleaned up amen how can I overcome and we'll notice when the unclean spirit is gone from a man he walks in dry places that's exactly what the church has done we read this this morning Baptist methodists those who believed in sanctification then Jesus said the unclean spirit that went out return back to this church body and finds the house garnished swept and clean living Pure Clean lives sounds good doesn't it all right but then if that house is a field or occupied then he comes in with seven other evil demons worse than he was the last stage of this place is seven times worse than it was in the first place they had been better off to stay lutherans than it would be to receive that light what the light of another and fail to follow it so will the Pentecostals see he's telling the Pentecostals he said you had light but you cabbage down on that life and don't know what cabbage down means that means they stopped they took root and said this is it but what it was brother brandom's message was woven in there he come out of that and they didn't come with him that's what he's saying right here so will the Pentecostal seat you know what I mean the house is garnished what happened then when the enemy went back out under sanctification that was washed out returned back and found the house not filled with the Holy Spirit now the state of the church is joined with the league of churches the World Council of churches what's he saying they had Truth Listen I'll promise you Martin Luther and John Wesley would not put up with what's going on in their churches today they would not go into the World Council of churches they're born again believers they would they they would say unclean and get away from it but you see now they're all moving into it because Luther's not there Wesley is not there and that Spirit of them too is gone all right look he said look that's when men that's where men takes it we talking this morning Christianity is not based on what people do to you it's not based on conditions well they that's the whole thing you talk to people and they go well they didn't it ain't about them it's about you right Jesus said you've heard that thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy listen he was quoting the Old Testament that's right sir listen he can't unquote the word okay but him being the word he didn't change the Commandments he magnified them made them where you could live them so now if you love your neighbor and hate th enemy you got a problem because he's saying this but I say Toto you I'm going to come in into you and I'm going to start living that life back out right I couldn't do it in the Old Testament but I can in the New Testament love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you do you include people that hate you in your daily prayers I didn't think so I do because the Lord convicted me on that not too long ago to pray for the people that hate you and say things about you and all those different things that's right hard to do though isn't it come on shake your head it's hard to do that but Jesus said to do it so when we going to start doing what God said that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven CU remember he looked at them and he said you got a different father than I do you hate me without a cause I love you I Agape you he didn't love him like a brother he loved them he was their God and he Agape loved him so much that he gave his life for him but they didn't agape love him back they didn't have anything they're to love with everybody with me love your enemies do good to them which hate you bless them that curse you pray for them which despitefully use you and as you would that men should do to you do also to them likewise remember that's a golden rule do unto others as you have them do unto you somebody said one time do unto others and run that's not the way to do it for if you love them which love you what thank have you for Sinners also love those that love them now if you'll look at the Bible that love translates the one up above translates to gape this right here because a sinner can't have a gape love that's right a sinner has filal love which is a conditional love agape love is unconditional love and if you do good do good to them which do good to you what thanks have you for Sinners also do the Same Love love your enemies do good lend hoping for nothing again and your reward shall be great you shall be the children of the highest for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil all right real quick now when Jesus not because you can be Orthodox because you can explain your religion hello that isn't really what he meant by a man must be born again it isn't so much intellectual but something has happened happened down here that's changed right down here that's changed that man it's changed his motive changed his ideas it's changed his life as I was speaking last night he's coming to the inner Court he's not talking about the New Birth he's talking about the inner court right which is called listen it's not the holy of holies is in the middle the holy place is where we're talking about now the inner court is the holy place all right not the holy of holies but it is a holy place out here and out here in the outer Court it didn't say nothing about holy Place anybody can walk back and forth but when you go through that other one and only certain priests can go in there and I'll read to you exactly how you can go in there and you got to interpolate that yourself for the time cuz that was the Old Testament okay meet him anywhere the veil is dropped around him he lives is daily for God meet him anywhere anytime he still got that testimony on his heart in any trial he still holds good it works friend I know it by experience everybody be brother Brown was a prophet right we we we're still in the right place okay people go to church shake your hand laugh and call your brother I read this this morning outside of the church they pull a business deal that wouldn't be just exactly straight for personal gain I wouldn't say them people are here in the Tabernacle but I say there is there's things that people would do and they get they got get different at least little things will bring at least little thing will bring that temper back selfishness open up an ear to hear gossip or do something to that type that person has never entered in to this pot in here all right we're going to read it in just a second well they're they're outside they're truly eating the same Mana they've been brought into the camp into the camp in the field is where the people got the Mana and they're in there and that Mana that they eat is the same Mana this man eats here they both have the same Pastor they both read the same Bible but one constantly stays true and humble and the other one's got his ups and downs going like this in and out both of them eating the same Mana but one of them has entered in the other one is still out both of them are believers unto eternal life that's why I said sanctification is a wonderful place to be you're heading toward eternal life you're this close you are actually one piece of cloth away from going into the holy of holies that's how close it is but if you don't enter in you don't get what's in that holy of holies one is baptized with the Holy Spirit into the kingdom of God both are believers un eternal life one is baptized with the Holy Ghost in the kingdom of God and the other one is outside Eden the same manner and the people said you got to shout to get in here you have to speak in tongues to get in here you have to do all these things but we find out that those things don't work he seen people shout I have no way of judging well he didn't I've seen people that shouted that lived any kind of Life we' seen people dance in the spirit there's something wrong yet they enjoy the blessings of God they believe in it they have faith in it but it's only in this outer court it's never come to the inner Court they've never got from here down to here I want you to see I don't know if you can see that or not it's a little bit blurry but this is another way to look at it all right Shake Yourself we'll be done in just a minute hot up here but remember this is the outer Court this is typing justification you got your Brazen altar you got your Laver you need to be baptized and get your sins forgiven you walk through now listen I want you to listen to something there's not three veils there's only two oh don't get quiet Paul Paul tells us in Romans that there's only two veils thank you I knew some of you knew what I was talking about it's not a veil it's just an entrance way it don't shut anything out you can go in dogs can run through here cats horses and anything can run through here but when you get to right here you see that you got to pull it apart now there's a candlesticks then you've got the table of shoes bread we'll talk about that in a minute and then there's a small little golden altar that only special incense are burned they're not burned on the outside they're burned on the inside and you can only smell it on the inside oh boy we'll get into something in a minute for there was a tabernacle made the first wherein was the Candlestick the table the shoe bread which is called The Sanctuary all right right now looked up the word shoe bread it means loaf but it's food composed of flour mixed with water and baked now remember the Israelites made it in the form of an oblong or round cake as thick as one's thumb and as large as a plate or platter hence it was not to be cut but broken amen my body which is broken for you often these loaves were con consecrated to the Lord at the Lord's table now watch Shake Yourself just a minute the inner coridor holy place I kind of compiled this from internet back there and it's a good explanation the Tabernacle was divided into two areas see they divided into two areas too not three now we know we're a three room house we know we're a three but this outside guy listen this guy doesn't do anything except what the inside guy tells it to do it just keeps your guts together interpret that it just keeps everything together and he built the inner court with three rows of huge stones and a row of Cedar beams first king 6 the Tabernacle was divided into two areas the inner court and the holy of holies they didn't even count the outer Court they were separated by a veil or a curtain all right the inner Court was surrounded by the outer Court like the picture and contained the golden altar of incense the table of shoe bread and the golden Candlestick all right note the curtain symbolized how the people were separated from God because of sin cuz remember you had to walk through that Veil and it come back shut again well whatever was going on outside stayed out there everybody with me all right the golden altar of incense was the second altar in the Tabernacle remember there's one out outside it was for the burning of God's special incense not to be burned outside and was positioned in the Holy place before the veil all right it was the last thing you saw before you walked into the holy of holies all right wake up it was symbolic of acceptable prayer though shall make an altar and it tell you but the table of shoe bread now watch this was a wooden table when you walk into that room there was a Candlestick over here shoe bread was on a table here and the altar of incense was right here right before you went into the to the last through the last Veil all right so remember we're talking about sanctification we're talking about getting clean but listen it is something you got to do cuz when you walk in there listen to me if you walk in there the candlesticks had to be lit by the priest kept lit oil kept being poured in man had to do it man had to make the shoe bread you have to listen to a fivefold Ministry through men to get to the holy of holies you got to go through that room and the altar of incense was what it was fired by a priest put the fire in it this was a wooden table located in the North side of the Tabernacle directly across from the golden candlesticks it held the bread of the presence presence which were 12 loaves of bread right right 12 loaves of bread for the priest and the tribe of Levi and symbolize the spiritual nourishment God offers his people but remember God didn't give it man made it when you go back in the holy of holies God made the Mana that's right God wrote the Ten Comm Commandments right God did those things and where did they meet God not where I'm talking about they met him back there you're heading toward it now listen you can get close like I said there's only one little skin between you and that but you can turn around and walk out various other ens utensils were kept the golden candle stat was placed on the south side of the Tabernacle in the Holy place 25 the candles was actually a lampstand we know that brother Ram told us and they do call it lamp lampstands in the Bible it had seven burning all lamps and lighted the holy place for the priest its chief purpose was to illumin illuminate or illumin all that was in the sanctuary all right so remember like brother Brown said you go outside it's hot it's hot it's cold it's raining it's good weather it's bad weather it's dark it's light when you walk into that second realm it stayed that same light that's the light they had to depend on WE the world Listen the world had to depend on seven Church ages being here right for us to fulfill and get this message to the Jews there had to be seven Church ages there had to be seven spirits of God and seven men with seven messenges Messengers messages to light the world but it was by man that's sanctification that's why you can be Sanctified without being filled with the Holy Ghost but you can have some of the same things the people with the Holy Ghost is God in a portion amen okay the light symbolized Jesus the light of the world now listen for there was a tabernacle made the first and wherein was the Candlestick and the table and the shoe bread which is called the sanctuary and I read this did it again now first Samuel now watch you remember the remember the scenario we were talking about where Jesus they were eating corn I believe on the Sabbath or something they were eating the um going by eating corn him and his disciples and the priest got all over him he said well hey David eat the shoe bread that was in the Tabernacle and nothing happened to him in other words he said but you're talking to the lord of the harit you're you're talking to the man that wrote that right but you know why David could do it listen listen David did not there's all there's always something to God that's different than than us our thinking my thinking was David was hungry he walks in there and blessed God there's the bread and I'm going to eat it I'm the king if David was typing Jesus Christ he had to do it by the word all right wake up and the priest answered David now watch listen to this there is no common bread under mine hand in other words we haven't have we don't have any bread made for you outside of this but there is hallowed bread shoe bread if the young men have kept thems at least from women now here is the law David went right by the law David answered the priest and said unto him of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days since I came out and the vessels of the young men are [Music] holy explains every bit of it David didn't just walk in and they were you know they' had a woman the day before and they weren't clean and they were all this no David said hey we haven't been around women for 3 Days that's what the law says the law says for us to be clean we're clean the vessels of the young men Men Are Holy and the bread is in a manner common in other words it's on it's on the table yay though it were Sanctified this day in the vessel so the priest gave him hallowed bread for there was no bread there but the shoe bread that was taken from before the Lord to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away what you saying brother Wade if we'll go by what the Bible says listen to me if we go by what the Bible says we can approach just about any way the Bible tells us to the problem is we get it all twisted around and bless God I'm David H bless God I'm bride I can go do what I want to no David knew the law and he went by the law he knew he was Sanctified he knew he could partake of it and that's what Jesus was telling him he said well David did the same thing amen 1 Chronicles 9 when was this bread prepared on the Sabbath and other of their Brethren are the sons of the kites were over the shoe bread to prepare it every Sabbath so every Sabbath there was new bread made that's right am I getting somewhere with somebody every Sunday there's a new message am that that you sustain yourself with this one and then you seven days later you get another one you get another what substance to eat with 2 Chronicles 13 and they burn into the Lord every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense the shoe bread also set they in order upon the pure table and the candlesticks of gold with the lamps thereof to burn every evening the shall be lying about the evening time the path to Glory you will surely find and the water way the LIE today for we keep the charge of the Lord Our God they did now listen God honored the law when the law was in effect God honored the law that's what he said if you'll do this this is what will happen right they got in trouble when they didn't do what they said what's any different now there's just Grace but listen to this and then we'll close Hebrews 9:1 then barely the first Covenant had also ordinances of divine service and a worldly Sanctuary I showed it to you that was a worldly Sanctuary that was something made that people could see in the middle of the camp that where God met the priest and they got their sins forgiven once every year for there was a tabernacle made the first wherein was was the Candlestick the table and the shoe bread which is called the sanctuary and after the second Veil see what I'm talking about and after the second Veil The Tabernacle which is called the holiest of all which had the golden sensor Ark of the Covenant overlaid roundabout with gold wherein was the gold pot that had mana and Aaron's Rod that budded and the tables of the Covenant that's what we're getting to next we're going to get into the Pentecostal blessing the holy of holies amen right listen let's stand our feet those Pentecostals got the Holy Ghost they got cleaned out they had the gifts they got the new birth for their time but remember a group got in there and said this is it we don't need no more whenever we get to a place to where we say this is it we need no more we're in trouble hello somebody we're in trouble us forign no more this is it we we don't need nothing else we need everything we need Fellowship I love fellowshiping with these brothers you can talk to the brothers and if they got the new birth and you got the new birth it ought to be I mean it ought to be a a a a a Feeding Frenzy amen a feeding frzy what the problem is sometimes you get vultures in with the Eagles well anyway praise the Lord but why can't we fellowship with each other like we did with brother Andre and and that's been my purpose and becoming a pastor here I want us to be to where we can fellowship with anybody I ain't worried about I ain't got the big head you got to believe me and or I'm goingon to cut you off I'm sorry that ain't that ain't Godly we don't put up with nonsense but Jesus didn't say no you you only love them if they got the right Doctrine he said love your enemies if you try to love people just like what Ed Solomon said try to love people it'll make your life a lot better it'll make you feel a lot better what happens is when that guy cuts you off and you don't flip him off he don't know what to do he knows what to do if you do what he thinks you're going to do there'll be road rage and somebody run the other one off and run the other one over and they shoot you now yeah best thing to do is one got cut me off the other day and I just went praise the Lord go ahead got past me the other day I mean he come around a brand new truck he whoa he was gone till we got around the curve and there was three grandmas right all three cars Side by
