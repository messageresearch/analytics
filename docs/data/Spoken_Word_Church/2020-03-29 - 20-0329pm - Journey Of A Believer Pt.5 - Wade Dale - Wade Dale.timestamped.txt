[1:55] good to be in the house with Lord good
[1:58] to be back here and worshipping Him in
[2:00] spirit and in truth good to have
[2:02] everybody online watching in and maybe
[2:08] some new ones god bless you from spoken
[2:09] word church here in Lula Georgia we are
[2:13] doing what the state of Georgia has
[2:16] asked us to do with ten people and stay
[2:19] six feet apart and we're washing our
[2:22] hands more than we probably ever have
[2:25] and so we're doing the best we can with
[2:28] all with God but we're going to try to
[2:29] get the Word of God out so the people
[2:31] can hear and so that you will not know
[2:34] that we are cowering away from this
[2:39] thing but I saw a post the other day
[2:42] that told us that you know I believe in
[2:44] God I have faith in God but when I
[2:47] opened the oven to get us something hot
[2:49] out of the oven I use oven mitts yeah
[2:53] when I get in my car I put a seat belt
[2:56] on but still I have faith in God so we
[2:59] know one thing's for sure that god I
[3:02] like what brother Brady told me a long
[3:04] time ago when I first met him he said
[3:06] brother wait God gave us five senses use
[3:10] them use them you know so he gave us a
[3:15] responsibility to take care and we're
[3:17] supposed to be the cleanest people on
[3:18] the earth anyway you know so we're
[3:21] supposed to be practicing these things
[3:23] and and while you're sitting at home
[3:28] enjoy enjoy being with your spouse enjoy
[3:31] being with your kids sit down and
[3:33] commune with them and get to know them a
[3:35] little bit better and get to know your
[3:37] spouse a little bit better that's a
[3:39] bring us a little bit closer to each
[3:40] other and closer to God too so god bless
[3:44] you and we thank you for all the prayers
[3:45] and and the support we get from the
[3:47] church and and like I said we're brother
[3:50] Aaron will be speaking for us Wednesday
[3:52] we'll use this same format that we're
[3:55] using now and
[3:57] hope everything is okay at home I know
[3:59] everybody wants to be here but let's do
[4:02] our part right now
[4:05] and as we do our part right now and that
[4:07] means that if everybody else would do
[4:09] their part around the world then with
[4:12] the social distancing and washing your
[4:13] hands and all that that we will this
[4:16] thing will come to a close I was
[4:18] thinking you know we were talking the
[4:20] other day about how Moses when the
[4:23] children of Israel would go that they do
[4:26] something awful and and God has sent a
[4:29] plague and and Moses would tell Aaron to
[4:33] run through the crowd with a sensor we
[4:37] got to remember they was people died
[4:40] sometimes up to 20,000 before God stayed
[4:44] the plague so I that's what we're
[4:47] praying that I hate that anybody dies I
[4:51] was thinking last night I thought men if
[4:53] they didn't know the Lord we got a lot
[4:55] of people that are passing away from the
[4:56] earth without without knowing God but
[4:59] God knows that he knows who they are and
[5:01] but we're just gonna pray for Humanity
[5:04] we're still human beings and as I said
[5:07] downstairs in the Sunday school class
[5:10] you can you can blame China you can
[5:14] blame Trump you can blame whoever I say
[5:19] let's just blame ourselves let's just
[5:22] blame our self that we haven't come to a
[5:23] place to where we can walk in
[5:26] Gainesville Hospital and just everybody
[5:29] be healed you know so blame yourself
[5:32] blame us that we're not in the position
[5:35] and I believe we're getting there but I
[5:37] I just want to put all the blame on me
[5:40] all the blame on me I'm the I'm the
[5:43] reason the raptures not took place I'm
[5:45] the reason brother Dale can't preach all
[5:46] the time like you should I'm the reason
[5:48] that some people act the way they do and
[5:50] if you'll all agree instead of blaming
[5:52] everybody else don't blame everybody
[5:57] else just blame yourself and just say
[5:59] hey Lord fix me first if you'll fix me
[6:03] first then maybe God will speak to you I
[6:05] was thinking this morning and and I'm
[6:08] not being
[6:10] I guess I'm not being mean but I'm
[6:12] interpreting you know brother Brown was
[6:14] talking about the 10th vision okay well
[6:17] the 10th vision was people were going in
[6:19] the tent getting healed and walking away
[6:21] and I thought about it the other day I
[6:23] started looking brother Danny all these
[6:25] hospitals now have them big long white
[6:27] tents in front of them and the people
[6:30] are going in and some are not making it
[6:33] but some are coming out feeling better
[6:36] some so maybe we need to pray that God
[6:39] will anoint those doctors and anoint
[6:41] somebody to create a vaccine instead of
[6:44] trying to argue with who's right and
[6:45] who's wrong good grief I've had enough
[6:47] of that we get enough of that during day
[6:49] the regular life we need to just focus
[6:51] on what God's doing what he's already
[6:53] done and what he's already give us an
[6:55] opportunity to do to me this is an
[6:57] opportunity for us to get one step
[6:59] closer to get out of here just one step
[7:02] closer to get out of here this is
[7:04] setting in motion things that we would
[7:05] have never thought like brother Dale
[7:07] said you can sit and try to figure
[7:08] things out and you think well this is
[7:10] gonna come this and this is going to
[7:12] come this way and then we'll all of a
[7:13] sudden here we got a little bitty bug
[7:14] that you can't even see and it's
[7:18] infecting people and it shut the whole
[7:21] world down not just as brother Lewis we
[7:23] were doing Wednesday night we did a
[7:25] little thing for the brothers overseas
[7:27] and he interpreted in Spanish because
[7:29] they wanted to kind of understand what
[7:30] was going on over here but the Bible
[7:32] says the whole world is groaning so now
[7:35] literally the whole world 151 countries
[7:38] are groaning and travailing waiting for
[7:41] what the manifestation of the sons of
[7:43] God just like the whole creation is the
[7:44] whole nature is you know you all the
[7:46] nature all there there groaning waiting
[7:49] on us to come back to that Adam and Eve
[7:51] condition as brother Dale was talking
[7:54] about this morning so god bless you we
[7:55] love you thank you for all the prayers
[7:58] just keep praying for us most of us
[7:59] still have our jobs and still going to
[8:01] work and doing what we're doing so we
[8:02] thank God for that and just pray the
[8:05] Lord's protection and what we're doing
[8:07] and and then you know if whatever this
[8:11] thing holds I pray that we'll get back
[8:13] to having church services again for that
[8:15] I enjoy it I know you at home miss it
[8:18] too but just create an atmosphere like
[8:21] brother man said you're a creator so
[8:22] right now
[8:23] an atmosphere that you're in a church
[8:25] service you know don't let the kids go
[8:27] running through the room and don't do it
[8:29] sit down and do just like you would
[8:30] prepare for service and I believe you'll
[8:32] get something out of it all right so
[8:34] we're still on journey a journey of a
[8:35] believer and I it's part five not part
[8:38] four so a brother Joe correct the meal
[8:42] nets and that's okay so it is part five
[8:44] on there I've still got it for a lamb
[8:45] but turn the Galatians three and I'm not
[8:48] going to make any announcements I don't
[8:50] know if we're going to be able to have
[8:52] the April the 18th for our Spring Fling
[8:57] get-together or for brother Dale's
[9:01] birthday dinner on April the 19th we'll
[9:05] just continue as we're going if they
[9:08] release us to do it we'll do it if not
[9:10] we'll postpone it so but other than that
[9:13] all the other we're gonna still look for
[9:15] the June maybe by then everything will
[9:18] be opened up and we'll still have our
[9:19] Father's Day fishing thing in June and
[9:22] be time for us to get out and that's
[9:24] brother Danny made me realize you can
[9:28] still go fishing and you can still
[9:29] there's really turkey seasons about all
[9:31] the sin but you can still go fishing the
[9:33] DNR told him they were still stalking
[9:34] the streams and you can still go to the
[9:36] lake and fish you know it's like I think
[9:38] me and him we're saying we talk about
[9:40] social distancing when I'm fishing I
[9:42] don't want nobody around me anyway back
[9:44] if it's a good hull right then it's me
[9:48] if it's a good hole I don't want you go
[9:49] find your six-foot somewhere else you
[9:51] know so but it you can't get out get out
[9:53] and enjoy go out in your yard
[9:55] I mean I'm enjoying my bees now so
[9:59] they're all going at it you know and
[10:01] pollinating everything and so we're you
[10:05] can make this situation what you want to
[10:07] make out of it you make it good bad or
[10:09] indifferent I want to make it good I
[10:11] want to make it worse a good thing that
[10:13] we can that we can do what we're doing
[10:15] so let's bow our heads and speak to the
[10:17] author before we read Galatians 3 the
[10:20] only father we thank you today for this
[10:22] opportunity that we have to come here
[10:24] and Lord to expound on your word father
[10:28] this is an eternal thing that we're
[10:30] looking at today before the foundation
[10:33] of the world Lord you wrote that Bible
[10:35] in in your mind and brother
[10:37] was talking about now that mine has come
[10:39] down to a group of individuals in the
[10:41] end time and it's a part of your eternal
[10:44] word father and that's what we are as
[10:46] Christians were part of the eternal Word
[10:47] of God so we asked you to sanctify Lord
[10:50] for this journey keep us safe keep this
[10:53] no virus away from us Lord and I pray in
[10:55] the name of Jesus Christ that you would
[10:57] stay this thing Lord in and let it it's
[11:00] got to run a little bit of its course
[11:01] but as we were talking about Moses and
[11:03] Aaron Lord send the sensor down through
[11:06] the hospitals and send the healing angel
[11:09] Lord to heal these people look after the
[11:12] doctors and the poor nurses that are
[11:14] trying their best to do what they can
[11:16] Lord in just a new thing and where it's
[11:20] all unchartered water but we pray Lord
[11:22] that it wasn't a surprise to you you
[11:25] knew before the foundation of the world
[11:27] this was going to happen and you knew
[11:29] they would be a bride on the earth and
[11:31] you knew that she would cry out for help
[11:33] Lord and that you have ever-present help
[11:35] Lord in a time of trouble father we ask
[11:38] just to be with each one heal the sick
[11:40] bless the ones that are home Lord be
[11:43] with each one as we go about our daily
[11:44] lives Lord and made this thing come back
[11:46] to normal we ask these things in Jesus
[11:48] Christ's name Amen so we're on a journey
[11:52] of a believer we've continued now
[11:53] through we're gonna hurry through
[11:56] justification and sanctification because
[11:58] even if you're watching in today and
[12:00] you're you're not a part of this church
[12:04] body then we believe that Abraham was
[12:08] our example God give us examples in the
[12:11] Bible to go by an Abraham was a perfect
[12:14] example of the journey of a believer
[12:16] alright he did not receive justification
[12:20] and sanctification in the baptism of
[12:22] Holy Ghost as we teach now but he was an
[12:24] example of that under the blood of bulls
[12:27] and goats he was under that anointing
[12:29] where he couldn't receive the new birth
[12:32] but he could be an example so that we as
[12:34] the seed of Abraham which we now have
[12:38] Christ inside of us that same person is
[12:41] going to go through that same journey
[12:42] all right so let's read Galatians 3:16
[12:44] says now to Abraham and his seed where
[12:48] the promises made he says not in the
[12:50] seeds of
[12:51] of many but as of one and to thy seed
[12:53] which is Christ because really Isaac was
[12:56] not the promised son Jesus Christ was
[12:59] the promised son and then we're heirs of
[13:01] that promise and this I say that the
[13:03] Covenant that was confirmed before of
[13:05] God in Christ the law which was four
[13:07] hundred and thirty years after cannot
[13:09] dissin all in other words it didn't do
[13:11] anything to what God promised to Abraham
[13:13] it actually enhanced what he was doing
[13:16] to Abraham cannot disannulled that it
[13:18] should make the promise of none effect
[13:20] for if the inheritance be of the law it
[13:23] is no more promise in other words
[13:26] brother Dale has an inheritance
[13:28] I'm his son so I get that inheritance
[13:31] automatically alright so if it be of the
[13:35] law then it's no more promise but God
[13:37] gave it to Abraham by a promise or by
[13:41] promise now let's read Hebrews 6 verse
[13:43] 13 through 15 for when God made promise
[13:47] to Abraham because you could swear by no
[13:49] greater he swear by himself in other
[13:51] words he said Abraham you know I'm gonna
[13:52] have anything to do with this
[13:53] Adam broke his covenant I made because
[13:55] it was a conditional covenant this is an
[13:57] unconditional covenant I'm going to make
[14:01] sure this takes place and when God makes
[14:05] sure it takes place that's got to take
[14:06] place because of the eternal okay but
[14:09] he's connecting himself as you'll see
[14:11] what brother Dale was talking about this
[14:12] morning he now has connected himself
[14:14] back to human beings where he can live
[14:17] in us not anoint Abraham or Abram to
[14:20] Abraham to do this thing he isn't he's
[14:23] now not just anointed us he's went in us
[14:25] being the seed of Abraham which is the
[14:28] faith seed of Abraham he swore by no
[14:32] greater so he knew it was going to be
[14:34] done all right so he swore by no greater
[14:36] he swore by himself saying surely
[14:37] blessing I will bless thee and
[14:39] multiplying I will multiply thee and so
[14:42] after he had patiently endured in other
[14:44] words Abram walked for 25 years as Abram
[14:48] with a promise but not the promise of
[14:52] having the promised son so after he had
[14:55] patiently endured he obtained the
[14:58] promise and you may be seasoned or that
[14:59] his blessing to the reading of the word
[15:01] now we'll run through this real quick if
[15:03] you'll notice
[15:05] the property God tells us when Abraham
[15:07] met him he was Melchizedek because we're
[15:10] going to get to that today where Abraham
[15:13] has his name change he goes and meets
[15:16] Melchizedek and that's the type of what
[15:18] he's going to do for us in the end time
[15:21] he's going to connect back with us in
[15:24] the son of man because that was a man in
[15:27] human flesh that met Abraham all right
[15:30] so we'll get to that and brother Brahim
[15:33] tells us when abraham met him he was
[15:34] Melchizedek he unfolds here what all the
[15:37] attributes will do in the final in if
[15:40] you realize what brother Dale is talking
[15:42] to us this is the way I see it
[15:43] God is not complete without you he had
[15:46] to give his attribute he had to give his
[15:48] attribute to you so he gave a piece of
[15:52] his self a piece of the puzzle a piece
[15:54] of the puzzle is now with you he had it
[15:58] all with him it was all right up here it
[16:00] was all in the beginning
[16:01] in the beginning was word words with God
[16:04] Word was God and that word was made
[16:07] flesh in Jesus Christ we know that but
[16:09] then it also was made flesh in me and
[16:12] you so the part of God you are it's like
[16:14] you're putting a puzzle together and men
[16:16] Jim's got old puzzles out we're putting
[16:18] puzzles together and all these things
[16:19] it's really it helps you mind especially
[16:21] when you get our age but when you can't
[16:24] find a piece of the puzzle the puzzles
[16:27] not complete
[16:27] you really don't see a hundred percent
[16:30] of the picture with pieces missing so
[16:32] God had to subdivide himself or divide
[16:35] himself out among the believers so that
[16:38] we can all come back together and then
[16:40] that piece of the puzzle is put back
[16:42] together so we had to be a part of God
[16:45] if we're born again you are a part of
[16:47] God
[16:48] you're an attribute as I said so every
[16:50] attribute is going to have to come to
[16:53] that he unfolds himself here what all
[16:57] the attributes that's menu will do it
[17:00] the final in every son of Abraham now
[17:03] that we're not ever son of Abram its son
[17:07] of Abraham will do in the final in every
[17:10] son of the faith will absolutely do the
[17:13] same thing and like I said before we
[17:15] have faith in God
[17:18] we don't do stupid things like go out in
[17:20] the middle of the road back here and say
[17:22] okay god that next truck that comes down
[17:25] through here I'm just gonna melt right
[17:26] through it and you're gonna well you
[17:29] might melt through it but they may be a
[17:31] few days picking the pieces up okay but
[17:34] like I said before take that same
[17:36] situation though a kid run out in the
[17:38] middle of the road and you run out there
[17:39] and grab him and save him and God stops
[17:42] the car as we was telling them
[17:43] Sunday School class about June when
[17:46] there was a wreck upon money go
[17:51] mountains several years ago and and she
[17:53] was standing out in the middle the road
[17:54] with her hands up and the baby was right
[17:55] between her feet and the truck just I
[17:58] mean coming down that big ole Hill full
[17:59] of full of cargo it's in the heart not
[18:02] easy for them to stop and when they do
[18:04] put on their brakes they start
[18:05] fishtailing all that stuff
[18:07] well that thing stopped about ten feet
[18:08] from that baby so I believe that was God
[18:10] telling her to go out there because if
[18:12] not he would have he would have run
[18:14] right over the child so to me that's
[18:16] faith having faith for the time or faith
[18:18] for the moment so like I said again
[18:20] let's don't be let's don't be stupid
[18:22] let's do the things we're supposed to do
[18:24] and then let God lead us and guide us
[18:26] into all truth amen so we look at
[18:29] justification in Genesis 12 I told them
[18:31] we're not going to turn to that because
[18:32] we've been through it before but
[18:33] remember the Lord spoke to Abram in
[18:36] Chapter 12 for those of you that maybe
[18:38] are not familiar with this the walk of
[18:40] Christian takes three attributes or
[18:43] three ways of getting to God and one is
[18:45] justification because justification
[18:48] means he begins you on your journey and
[18:51] you become just are justified and all
[18:56] your child all your past sins are
[18:58] chopped off Abram is called in Genesis
[19:01] chapter 12 he says the Lord said unto
[19:04] Abram get thee out of that country so
[19:06] you're gonna have to separate that's
[19:08] where we we go with the Baptist and a
[19:11] different one so far as to say that once
[19:13] saved always save if you're truly saved
[19:16] to begin with a man because
[19:18] justification chops off your past sins
[19:21] but you still have a journey of
[19:23] sanctification where God will clean you
[19:26] out the Bible says in the Book of Luke
[19:28] that the unclean spirit goes out of a
[19:30] man walks in dry places so what
[19:32] ever you were doing before you're not
[19:34] gonna do that anymore if truly that
[19:36] spirit has gone out and then God puts
[19:39] his Holy Spirit in and then he doesn't
[19:42] just put his Holy Spirit in he seals the
[19:44] bottle and then he keeps all that
[19:46] goodness inside all right but I don't
[19:49] want to say once saved always saved and
[19:51] then it's kind of like a I was telling
[19:53] you the other day where this banker
[19:55] friend of mine you know we were out in
[19:56] the middle of the wait and he was
[19:57] drinking a beer and cursing and smoking
[19:59] a cigar and he said he just got saved
[20:01] and I said John what you get saved from
[20:05] what you say from I told him how I got
[20:08] saved we'll see I don't do those things
[20:09] anymore and it's not just do's and
[20:11] don'ts I have no desire to do that the
[20:14] desire has went away his desire wasn't
[20:16] gone away he might have come to a place
[20:18] of repentance and ask God to forgive him
[20:22] of his sins and he was sorry for what he
[20:23] did but why would you go back and do the
[20:26] same thing he had you asked forgiveness
[20:27] for and then you just keep doing it and
[20:30] you keep doing it I said John I said
[20:33] save means if you fall out of this boat
[20:35] and I reach and grab you you're drowning
[20:38] and put you back in the boat that's
[20:40] salvation but you're telling me that you
[20:43] went ahead and fell right back out of
[20:45] the boat again back into the same water
[20:46] now God's not that way he's not just
[20:48] gonna keep doing this
[20:50] amen so that's the same way with Abram
[20:53] Abram started on a journey in Genesis
[20:55] chapter 12 through justification which
[20:57] the Bible tells us that being justified
[20:59] freely Romans 3 verse 24 if you'll pull
[21:02] that one up being justified freely by
[21:05] His grace the problem is as we try to
[21:07] justify our self a lot of times I am
[21:10] justifying ourself we're not to just the
[21:13] fire he's the justifier the Lord Jesus
[21:17] is the just one and if we'll connect to
[21:20] him because look being justified freely
[21:23] by His grace through the redemption that
[21:25] is not in us we receive Redemption but
[21:29] the redemption is in Christ Jesus whom
[21:32] God hath set forth to be a perpetuation
[21:35] through faith in his blood it all based
[21:39] on faith to declare his righteousness
[21:41] not mine and yours
[21:44] you better not declare yours you could
[21:46] declare his righteousness for the
[21:48] remission of sins that are past listen I
[21:52] you can't pray and say Lord forgive me
[21:54] for what I'm gonna do tomorrow you ain't
[21:57] got there yet but God forgive me I know
[22:00] what I did in the past I know what I did
[22:02] yesterday I know what I did a few hours
[22:04] ago and God forgive me of that because
[22:07] remembers brother Dale's always told us
[22:08] grace is not for the future grace is for
[22:12] the past amen just what you did in the
[22:15] past so but when we still come to the
[22:17] place to where you know we like to take
[22:19] a little social drink or a little social
[22:21] chew or a little whatever you might have
[22:24] got you might have repented of it back
[22:27] then and got rid of and got rid of that
[22:29] part but the person that still made you
[22:31] do that is still in there so God's not
[22:33] going to reside do you understand what
[22:36] I'm talking about God's not going to
[22:37] reside in an unclean vessel so you're
[22:39] going to continually these things are
[22:41] going to sure we battle as human beings
[22:43] listening folks we bother you know that
[22:45] we Bible every day because what Satan
[22:48] wants to do he wants to get back into
[22:50] that vessel that he had control of
[22:52] before because he can't understand cuz
[22:56] he can't go through these processes that
[22:59] you and I go through he can't go through
[23:01] him because he's white he's not he can't
[23:03] be saved sorry but he can't he made that
[23:06] choice a long time ago but we can and he
[23:09] can't understand how we can say no no I
[23:13] know that's not part of me anymore
[23:17] so he can't get in that vessel anymore
[23:20] but if he's already in there he's just
[23:24] gonna keep doing what he did before and
[23:26] that was the same way with Abram as we
[23:28] looked and and keep that right there as
[23:31] we look in Genesis chapter 12 the Lord
[23:36] says alright Abram get up get out of
[23:38] your country in other words stop what
[23:40] you're doing and we won't I want you to
[23:42] walk in a different direction all right
[23:45] I don't want you to walk in the same
[23:47] direction so that's what I said about
[23:48] once saved always saved if you're still
[23:51] walking in the same direction you did I
[23:52] don't care if you made a confession or
[23:54] whatever you made several years ago what
[23:57] are you doing now
[23:58] because look god you're in a journey God
[24:01] is always moving you know that's why if
[24:03] you look at if you look at the Wailing
[24:06] Wall when people Adele's been there and
[24:08] I watch the documentary just a couple of
[24:11] days ago that's why they're doing this
[24:13] because they know God Jehovah even all
[24:17] through the Old Testament is a journey
[24:19] and God is always in motion so when they
[24:22] go to the Wailing Wall they're not just
[24:23] doing this for nothing they're doing
[24:25] this in reverence to God that God is in
[24:27] motion
[24:28] God is not still God is doing something
[24:30] so he that's why they do that at the
[24:33] Wailing Wall is that because God is
[24:35] moving so now we look at Abram Abram now
[24:40] God said get up and go get away from
[24:43] what you used to do but the problem with
[24:46] Abram is Abram as in our Christian
[24:50] journey to begin with starts making a
[24:52] lot of mistakes number one God told him
[24:56] to get up and move and what's the first
[24:58] thing he did he brought lot with him all
[25:01] right so that's like I said before he
[25:02] brought a lot and that's our problem we
[25:04] take a lot with us all right when we
[25:06] start our journey but listen as long as
[25:08] you're in that journey you'll start
[25:09] shedding those things as you go through
[25:12] your journey all right because Abram
[25:14] started shedding these things at one
[25:16] point he says all right light you go
[25:18] that way I'll go this or you go wherever
[25:19] you want to go I'll take the other way
[25:21] they're had there's somewhere in life
[25:23] like brothers like we were talking about
[25:25] you know you got friends that do what
[25:28] you do because you're of the same
[25:30] kindred spirit right but when you come
[25:34] to a place that you realize that God's
[25:37] working on you and he's not working on
[25:39] them at that moment there has to be a
[25:42] separation time because it's like water
[25:44] and oil they don't mix what you used to
[25:47] say they say okay beer yeah
[25:50] bar yeah let's go smoke yeah but now
[25:53] when you do the same identical thing and
[25:56] they say that to you and it has no hold
[25:59] on you at all and you go no I don't
[26:02] think I want to do that
[26:03] no and you keep repeating then somewhere
[26:06] down the line there's got to be a
[26:09] separation Abram and lot
[26:11] Abram had to separate from the lock that
[26:14] he took with him so you got to separate
[26:17] from the lot that you take with you your
[26:19] old baggage somewhere there's got to be
[26:21] a separation then jamming in Genesis
[26:23] somewhere in 1314 and there you see that
[26:26] Abram is walking and even lots walking
[26:28] with him and then all of a sudden Abram
[26:31] says stop
[26:34] we somewhere in here we got divided
[26:36] because we're getting - in other words
[26:39] like I always said you the herdsmen were
[26:41] the problem so Abraham's angels and lots
[26:43] demons were fighting each other same way
[26:45] with you that's what happens is God
[26:47] comes and gives you an anointing to
[26:49] carry you in through your journey
[26:50] because listen he knows you're gonna
[26:52] make it to the end you don't so if he
[26:55] knows you're gonna make it to the end
[26:56] the Bible says those who he has
[26:57] justified
[26:58] he has already glorified so your journey
[27:01] has already set as brother they will
[27:03] talk to us about in foreknowledge and
[27:05] predestination but the destiny is
[27:08] determined but you don't know we don't
[27:10] know tomorrow we don't know tonight but
[27:14] we know who holds tonight and we know
[27:16] who holds tomorrow and that's where we
[27:17] put our faith that's why Abram is going
[27:21] toward Abraham but that's the father of
[27:23] our faith he just got up and left he
[27:27] didn't have some great big you know and
[27:29] we have these clouds and we have all
[27:32] these signs Abram had zero zero sign and
[27:36] I believe brothers ask you had zero sign
[27:39] but they were some things happening
[27:41] things going on things that you couldn't
[27:45] stand anymore that used to be
[27:47] comfortable doing listen we've all been
[27:48] through that so same way with Abram God
[27:51] says hey Abel and get out of there Abram
[27:54] takes a lot with him but then all of a
[27:55] sudden God says okay there's gonna be a
[27:57] time when that Lots gotta separate from
[27:59] you well where did Locke go lot went to
[28:01] Sodom had a lot of problems and in
[28:07] justification you're going to have a lot
[28:09] of problems look to declare I say at
[28:11] this time his righteousness continued
[28:15] it's net you self-righteous people like
[28:18] us Dwight Moody said God will only fill
[28:21] those who not fold their self ok so
[28:23] self-righteous people are
[28:25] self-righteousness one that works is
[28:27] okay so anyway God's righteousness no if
[28:30] we take his righteousness and we envelop
[28:32] ourself in his righteousness because
[28:35] look that he might be just and the
[28:37] justifier of him which is us which
[28:43] believeth in Jesus is everybody got that
[28:45] same an all right
[28:47] so now let's go to Ezekiel 11 we're
[28:49] still in the justification where we're
[28:51] looking that justification is where God
[28:53] says I'm gonna use you but you're still
[28:56] dirty
[28:57] okay I'm gonna use you I'm gonna pick
[29:00] the jar up off out of the out of this
[29:03] cesspool that we were in all of us we're
[29:06] in there at one time God picks it up and
[29:08] you know what if God picks it up a lot
[29:10] of times they will justify herself we
[29:13] start going oh I think I'll do know God
[29:16] God went to Abram Abram didn't call God
[29:20] you didn't call him God sure you did
[29:23] sure you did but no it was God calling
[29:25] you it was something coming to you first
[29:27] to make you response so first God came
[29:31] to Abram and said Abram walk before me
[29:34] talk to me I'm gonna show you these
[29:37] things and I will make thee a great
[29:38] nation I will bless thee this is verse 2
[29:41] of chapter 12 and I will bless them that
[29:43] bless thee and curse them that curse
[29:44] thee so God is to me I like to look at
[29:48] like this god knows where we're gonna go
[29:51] in our life so he puts a little
[29:52] protective bubble around us he puts an
[29:56] anointing around us now it's probably
[29:58] it's the Holy Ghost
[29:59] because remember justification is a work
[30:01] of the Holy Ghost it's not the person of
[30:03] the Holy Ghost but he's working with you
[30:05] because remember he can't attach himself
[30:08] to something that's dirty we can't drink
[30:11] out of the glass wing when God first
[30:13] picks the glass up out of the sewer he's
[30:16] going to have a purpose for that glass
[30:18] but he's not going to fill it up and
[30:20] start drinking out of it right then
[30:21] neither are we banned in our natural
[30:23] life all right what are we going to do
[30:25] we're going to sanitize the jar right
[30:27] we're going to make sure it goes through
[30:29] a process to get rid of everything
[30:31] inside there because when we pour
[30:33] whatever we're going to pour in there we
[30:36] can't contaminate it and
[30:38] God's gonna pour himself in that vessel
[30:40] like I said before talk about the once
[30:43] saved always saved I agree with you if
[30:45] you truly got saved and God put his self
[30:48] inside of you change your desires and
[30:50] then he sealed it so Satan can't get in
[30:53] and God can't get out now the lid was
[30:57] off this thing brother Dale would be wet
[30:59] right but it's been sealed and that's
[31:02] what we're trying to get to if we'll get
[31:04] to it today I'll try not to go to ours
[31:06] again I'm sorry about last Sunday but it
[31:08] just felt good so we just kept on going
[31:10] and nobody fell asleep so we we the
[31:12] sleep the sleep your spirits may be home
[31:14] mmm anyway Ezekiel just say it Ezekiel
[31:19] 11 verse 17 God's telling us and I want
[31:24] you to see how God's working here
[31:25] therefore say thus saith the Lord God I
[31:28] will even gather you from the peoples
[31:29] season same over you or not he's get
[31:32] heat what'd he do he took Abram out of
[31:34] his country he took you in justification
[31:38] he took you away from not you're not
[31:40] sure earthly family mother father says
[31:44] and may have them but all of that family
[31:46] you were with because you know what just
[31:48] like now this is your church family you
[31:50] had a worldly family and then these are
[31:52] the people you used to run with we
[31:54] always call run with somebody you know
[31:56] she was running with this person well we
[31:59] were running from God at that time so
[32:02] now we're running with God in our
[32:03] journey so was Abram therefore thus
[32:07] saith the Lord God I will even gather
[32:08] you from the people and assemble you out
[32:10] of the countries where you've been
[32:12] scattered in other words the world and I
[32:14] will give you the Land of Israel now
[32:16] we're talking about promised land our
[32:18] promised land and they shall come
[32:20] thither and they shall take away all the
[32:23] detestable things now look he's getting
[32:26] cleaning you up take all the detestable
[32:28] things therefore and all the
[32:30] abominations thereof from thence and I
[32:33] will give them one heart and I will put
[32:35] a new spirit within you now we're gonna
[32:37] get to that and I will take the Stoney
[32:39] heart out of your flesh and I will give
[32:41] them a heart of flesh you don't have a
[32:43] physical transplant by no means but God
[32:47] takes that old Stoney heart it just
[32:48] hates everything and talks about
[32:51] you know your Mama and Daddy and more
[32:55] you dated than your mama sometime but
[32:57] that's that old stony heart and God
[32:59] can't work with that why because it's
[33:01] set you've heard this the the saying
[33:05] it's set in stone well God don't want
[33:07] that he wants to make it pliable where
[33:10] he can use you and be the Potter and the
[33:13] clay be real pliable and then he can
[33:14] mold you into what he wants you to be
[33:16] and I will give them one heart so he's
[33:18] gonna give you a new heart what a new
[33:21] thought and you enter being a new enter
[33:23] direction is what he's going to give you
[33:26] that's what he gave Abram he gave Abram
[33:29] a new direction Abram was doing this
[33:32] everything was fine he was making idols
[33:34] with his daddy in the earth child easy
[33:35] I'd probably had a nice house and had
[33:38] everything going on and had probably had
[33:40] some social friends and then God just
[33:42] says you need to leave that place that's
[33:46] the same we spoke to us he spoke to our
[33:48] heart one dancing you need to leave the
[33:49] place not the physical place but the
[33:52] place that you're in you need to leave
[33:53] it because I want to deal with you I
[33:56] picked you up and I know I'm gonna use
[33:59] you now you're to the world you still
[34:01] look dirty and to you you still look
[34:03] dirty but to God those who is justified
[34:07] he's already glorified ain't that pretty
[34:09] that good clean water beautiful to drink
[34:13] I think I'll have a little right now
[34:14] mm-hmm
[34:19] so that's what he's done by knee in
[34:21] Ezekiel so that's Genesis 12 and chapter
[34:25] 13 he goes through many things chapter
[34:27] 14 then now chapter 15 they're not
[34:29] turning to it I told him not to we've
[34:30] been through it four four four services
[34:33] so if you want to though you can read it
[34:35] at home go to chapter 15 the Bible says
[34:38] after these things the word of the Lord
[34:40] came to Abram so what happens is is
[34:42] Abram God is not going to same thing in
[34:45] your journey Abram is not God is not
[34:47] going to just dump everything on top of
[34:49] you and say you got to know everything
[34:51] about this and that in the other you got
[34:53] to know how you're gonna be and you got
[34:55] to know how you react
[34:56] no God lets you walk through because he
[34:58] let Abram he'd give Abram the promise
[35:01] and he walked for 25 years before God
[35:05] his name to Abraham that was the promise
[35:08] to Abraham all right
[35:10] everybody got that he had to go through
[35:12] the journey of justification now we get
[35:18] into sanctification which begins in
[35:20] chapter 15 and we've seen sanctification
[35:25] chapter 15 that word is clean and set
[35:29] aside for service so he picks the jar up
[35:31] now he's going to use the jar but he's
[35:33] got to get it clean and we're not gonna
[35:35] take this water out here but there's
[35:37] just pretend there's nothing in it
[35:39] because there was old black muddy dirty
[35:41] water in there and then that ends in the
[35:44] Book of Luke it says the unclean spirit
[35:46] is going out so you pour all that out
[35:48] because God won't dwell in an unclean
[35:51] vessel and it's cleaned and set aside
[35:52] for service not put in service yet it
[35:55] would be horrible if I had this real
[35:58] pretty glass right here and there was
[35:59] nothing in it there's a purpose for that
[36:02] glass is to have really nice purified
[36:05] drinking water in it and man God won't
[36:08] Spira fied you a man and the only way to
[36:13] have purified you is to put purified him
[36:16] in you he's the perfection you're not
[36:20] but we're heading toward that direction
[36:23] Hebrews 2 verse 11 says for both he that
[36:26] sanctify and they who are sanctified are
[36:29] all of one you see how now God is moving
[36:32] closer to Abram because he's cleaning
[36:36] him and set in the side so now God can
[36:38] really touch the glass a lot better than
[36:40] he was probably doing like this you know
[36:42] when it was really dirty but remember in
[36:45] God's mind that's a part of him already
[36:48] okay and he has a purpose for that
[36:51] cleaned and set aside for service he's
[36:54] going to put this thing in service if
[36:56] you'll just continue what Abram just
[36:59] keep walking Abram went to Egypt Abram
[37:01] went to Canaan Abram Abram went to Iran
[37:04] he went to all these different plant
[37:06] what he kept moving he kept moving now a
[37:08] lot of times he got out of the will of
[37:10] God and he had to pay for it but so do
[37:12] wait all right
[37:14] and even but under sanctification you
[37:16] see that the Bible says after these
[37:18] things were
[37:19] one chapter 15 the word of the Lord came
[37:21] unto Abram in Division says fear not
[37:23] Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding
[37:26] great reward in other words I've come to
[37:30] a place to where I know you're sincere
[37:32] come see he's gonna check Abraham's
[37:35] sincerity over when he sacrificed Isaac
[37:39] his only son he's gonna check the
[37:41] sincerity of Abraham now he's checking
[37:44] the sincerity of Abram now he's checking
[37:46] your you say Hall is checking your
[37:48] sincerity he's not checking it for your
[37:50] purpose he's check I mean for his
[37:52] purpose he's checking it for your
[37:54] purpose he knew what Abram was gonna do
[37:57] before the foundation of the world
[37:58] Abram didn't know what he was gonna do
[38:01] but and what Abram did but look at this
[38:04] though in what Abram did God could use
[38:07] Abram and not John Henry or Joe or Jim
[38:10] or Tom or Ted or somebody out there
[38:13] you know God didn't just call Abram I
[38:15] believe he called a lot of people and
[38:17] they turned him down Abram was the only
[38:19] one that got up saying what with you why
[38:20] are you in a crowd of guys and all of a
[38:22] sudden God started picking on you well
[38:25] thank God because he knew what you would
[38:29] do
[38:29] he's not gonna cast his pearls before
[38:32] swine like he tells us not to and I hate
[38:36] to say this but he's not gonna waste his
[38:37] time knowing that somebody like Adolph
[38:40] Hitler he knew Adolph Hitler if you give
[38:42] him a million years of that's what I
[38:43] believe in the Lord knows if you're
[38:46] gonna accept him or not and if you're
[38:48] not ever gonna accept him sure God will
[38:53] bless you got a Lancer you pray
[38:54] especially for salvation but he'll know
[38:57] like people like that who you know
[38:58] they'll never do it so he don't have to
[39:00] give them anything because God can't
[39:02] give you something he can't give me the
[39:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost and take it
[39:05] away from you no no it can't Satan's an
[39:09] Indian giver God's not everybody got
[39:11] that so now in sanctification we see for
[39:14] both he that sanctifies and they who are
[39:16] sanctified are all of one watch he's
[39:18] coming together getting closer for which
[39:21] cause he is not ashamed to call them
[39:23] brethren start coming to church reading
[39:26] your Bible getting around a new group of
[39:29] people right you don't want to be around
[39:32] that old group of
[39:33] anymore be around the new group of
[39:34] people alright put you in or even in a
[39:37] we hate to say religion but it is a
[39:40] religious order that we come together as
[39:44] Baptists doing mess of the student
[39:46] Pentecostals and all the different ones
[39:47] we come together but says for which
[39:51] cause he's not ashamed to call them
[39:52] brethren saying I will declare thy name
[39:54] unto my brethren in the midst of the
[39:57] church will I sing praises unto thee
[39:59] alright so now let's go to Ezekiel 36
[40:02] the next one because watch what happens
[40:07] Abram goes through these many different
[40:09] things if you read chapter 15 and you'll
[40:12] see that Abram was told to bring some
[40:18] different animals in different sacrifice
[40:20] different things turtle doves and
[40:22] pigeons and Shi goats and a heifer and
[40:26] they all mean something but we we got to
[40:29] that last Sunday so we're not getting
[40:31] into it today I want to get on up a
[40:32] little bit closer to where Abraham meets
[40:35] Melchizedek but we see that God in other
[40:38] words what we're saying is is God even
[40:41] then I'll read from the unconditional
[40:43] covenant but a zekiel 36 verse 25 what
[40:46] for I will take you from among the
[40:49] heathen and remember and gather you out
[40:51] of all your country and bring you into
[40:53] your own land
[40:53] so he's Brett you got listen what is
[40:56] Redemption coming out of and going into
[41:00] so the Abram is showing the plan of
[41:04] redemption because he came out of the ur
[41:06] of Chaldees and he is now walking now
[41:09] sometimes he gets in the permissive will
[41:11] of God and he goes over to Egypt for a
[41:13] little while because it was a famine
[41:15] then you see him going right back to
[41:17] Canaan then right back to these
[41:18] different places you're gonna make a lot
[41:20] of mistakes but a lot of those mistakes
[41:22] are going to be taken care of in your
[41:24] journey in your walk all right because
[41:27] God takes the unclean spirit out now
[41:29] when he takes that unclean spirit out
[41:31] you don't have those desires anymore but
[41:34] remember though in the Book of Luke it
[41:37] tells us that it has unclean spirits
[41:38] only stays out for a little while he
[41:41] comes back and tries to get back in his
[41:44] house
[41:45] and he brings seven demons worse and
[41:47] tries to fill you up with a lot of
[41:49] religion go to church I still can't go
[41:52] to church but now you ain't got to pray
[41:53] all the time and you read your Bible
[41:55] while my goodness you don't need to do
[41:57] all that just goes Church or or whatever
[42:00] no that's not God that's the devil okay
[42:05] then I will sprinkle watch then I will
[42:08] sprinkle clean water upon you what he's
[42:11] washing you by the water of the word and
[42:13] you shall be clean from all your
[42:16] filthiness and from all your idols will
[42:18] I cleanse you
[42:20] what idols were the idols you had before
[42:22] the idols I had before the idols I don't
[42:25] have anymore
[42:26] Abram didn't have those idols anymore
[42:28] Abram was walking in a different
[42:30] direction than where he was in the error
[42:32] of child days everybody got that
[42:35] but now look he says a new heart also
[42:37] will I give you remember he took the
[42:39] stony heart out and give us a heart of
[42:40] flesh now watch he says and a new spirit
[42:43] well I put within you and I will take
[42:47] away the stony heart out of your flesh
[42:49] and I will give you a heart of flesh so
[42:51] now he's gonna put a new spirit in you
[42:53] well the new spirit that he puts in you
[42:55] it's not the Holy Spirit now many may
[42:58] claim that it is but if you'll look and
[43:00] see what it it continues on we'll read
[43:02] Ezekiel a little bit later
[43:04] he says I'll put my spirit in you now
[43:08] that's the spirit of Almighty God I'll
[43:10] put my spirit in you but he gives you a
[43:12] new spirit to help you cope with the
[43:15] people because light like I was you know
[43:21] leaving the leaving the church and being
[43:23] gone for all those years I was
[43:25] comfortable out there I wasn't
[43:26] comfortable here you know mama would
[43:28] call me and Danny and she'd say it's
[43:30] Easter and it's Mother's Day and it's
[43:32] Christmas cuz you you know you see the
[43:34] people are part of the they call it the
[43:36] ENC crowd the eastern Christmas crowd
[43:38] they just show up because mama shames
[43:40] them enough to come well that doesn't do
[43:42] you any good at the inside guy might get
[43:46] a few passes on your head from your mom
[43:48] and your daddy but it still the inside
[43:49] guy still dirty you brought the dirty
[43:51] vessel in and until you got changed you
[43:54] took the dirty vessel back out because
[43:56] because you showed it once
[43:58] you got back out from under all this
[44:00] okay so I say to you that then he's
[44:04] going to give you then a new spirit that
[44:07] unclean spirit is gonna leave and God
[44:08] will give you a temporary spirit because
[44:13] it's not residing in but what he's doing
[44:15] is he's getting you ready he's doing
[44:18] some sanitizing work we all are in our
[44:21] hand sanitizer thing and all that
[44:23] Washington for 20 seconds well God's
[44:26] doing that by the washing of the water
[44:28] of the word
[44:29] I wish soap and water could do it it'd
[44:32] be too easy
[44:32] but soap and water can't get down inside
[44:34] you where it needs to be but God can God
[44:37] can get down in there and he can he can
[44:39] man he can he uses some kind of solution
[44:42] that we never heard of his human beings
[44:45] or we wouldn't have these problems on
[44:46] the outside hey man so it's the baptism
[44:50] of the Holy Ghost I wish we had it on
[44:51] the outside guy yeah but we got it on
[44:54] the inside guy and he's one that's one
[44:56] where it protects us cuz he sealed us
[44:58] whatever that liquid is it's inside of
[45:00] you it's sealed in there all right but
[45:03] what he does is he he from what up from
[45:06] what I gathered when I was in my journey
[45:08] coming up would be the same as this is
[45:11] that God is training you to take the
[45:15] Holy Spirit because God's not just gonna
[45:20] justify you and then you're unclean
[45:23] spirits gonna leave and then all of a
[45:24] sudden he's gonna fill you with His Holy
[45:26] Spirit that's not the way it works and
[45:28] you know what you and I couldn't take it
[45:30] that well I mean really we did if not
[45:33] listen if not there would only be two
[45:34] works of grace okay or one work of grace
[45:38] but God said there was three works of
[45:40] grace so we got to go through them three
[45:42] works of grace and once we do though
[45:47] there it is and then you look back on
[45:51] your journey and you say that's exactly
[45:53] the way my my journey went was
[45:55] justification I realized what God did I
[45:58] realized the day that God emptied me out
[46:00] and then started what he started buffing
[46:05] on you a little bit started buffing on
[46:07] you a little bit so that's what he's
[46:08] listening to what brother Brown says
[46:11] on number the unconditional covenant it
[46:15] would be number to watch close now then
[46:17] when he come down the Holy Spirit to
[46:19] talk to Abraham nay some about Abram
[46:21] here in the book of Genesis 15 let's go
[46:25] down the second paragraph and the next
[46:26] thing now what's going to do
[46:28] he's confirming and giving an evidence
[46:30] now look close he's given an evidence or
[46:34] a proof to Abraham how he's gonna do
[46:36] this right here he's giving an evidence
[46:41] or a proof to Abraham how he's gonna do
[46:44] it
[46:45] you and your natural journey with God
[46:49] you sitting here are you reading your
[46:52] Bible are you praying are you talking to
[46:55] the other brethren it puts you in an
[46:57] atmosphere to where God can talk to you
[47:00] and he might talk to you through a
[47:03] brother our sister our deacon our
[47:06] preacher or somebody he's going to talk
[47:09] to you through them maybe sometimes they
[47:13] even test you to see if you know you can
[47:16] take this spirit that he's fixing to
[47:18] give you because you come into a place
[47:20] that you never were before look what's
[47:22] God he's confirming and giving an
[47:24] evidence close he's given an evidence or
[47:26] proof to Abraham how he's going to do
[47:29] this and he's going to do it listen if
[47:33] you want to be healed how he's going to
[47:35] do this then Abraham I'm shutting you
[47:38] out of the picture remember in Genesis
[47:39] 15 if you read it he puts Abram to sleep
[47:42] in other words he says Abram you got
[47:45] nothing to do with this I'm doing the
[47:47] work I'm the Sanctifier I'm the
[47:49] justifier and if you'll just let me do
[47:52] the work let go and let God that's the
[47:55] whole thing let go and let God if you
[47:58] let go and let God I'm shutting you out
[47:59] of the picture I'm putting you to sleep
[48:02] because remember the old yous guys died
[48:05] somewhere in this journey it didn't
[48:08] happen in justification the old Abram
[48:10] didn't die the old you didn't died you
[48:12] were still that old sinner
[48:13] even in justification you still had that
[48:16] unclean spirit and clean water was
[48:19] inside of you at justification but as
[48:22] you walk the unclean spirit is driven
[48:24] I say spirits driven out the different
[48:28] things you used to do and then God is
[48:30] gonna say look because you know what if
[48:32] if you'll remember in your journey just
[48:34] think back there's a lot of things I
[48:37] tried to do that failed that I thought
[48:42] it might have been what God wanted me to
[48:44] do
[48:44] that's Abram heading to Egypt because
[48:48] what you see a little something going on
[48:49] here and you go home I'm gonna deal with
[48:52] that know these things you gotta deal
[48:55] with it
[48:55] God wants you to deal with it because
[48:57] he's fixing to put a new spirit inside
[48:59] of you to help you deal with it
[49:01] everybody got that same way it happened
[49:04] to mediate it like I said it's not just
[49:07] some no God says let me handle this
[49:11] that's what he was telling Abram let me
[49:12] even in sanctification because when he
[49:14] puts the Holy Spirit inside of you he
[49:17] doesn't clean you and set aside you for
[49:19] service he puts you in service so you've
[49:22] you've in other words you've had your
[49:24] your one year of training at 15 years
[49:26] old for you driver's license he's
[49:28] training you how to drive and then when
[49:32] you turn 16 and he gives you the Holy
[49:33] Spirit you know how to drive the truck
[49:36] I'd hate for brother Ryan to drove drove
[49:40] that big old truck he drives about 20
[49:42] years ago or whenever you turn 16 ever
[49:46] how many years ago that was five years
[49:47] ago fourth it'd be a disaster even if
[49:55] even if somebody's like brothers like
[49:57] gets in that big old forty foot more
[50:00] than that 48 foot Peterbilt or whatever
[50:04] it is you got driver's license right but
[50:08] you ain't got truck driver's license
[50:09] that's what God's God's showing you
[50:12] exactly where your position is even in
[50:14] your sanctification you have nothing to
[50:18] do with this I'm going to train you I
[50:20] got to start what he's starting from
[50:22] nothing there's nothing inside here
[50:24] he's starting from nothing you're in our
[50:27] head hey man you're our head there's
[50:31] nothing there then he says Abram I'm
[50:36] shutting you out of the picture I'm
[50:37] putting you two
[50:38] sleep then before Abraham came a black
[50:40] sickness in other words every sinner
[50:42] deserves to go to hell blackness you
[50:47] ever thought about that even in your
[50:49] journey you thought about hey I could
[50:50] have went to hell if I had died I'd be
[50:53] gone so he makes you realize see it but
[50:56] God is not making you realize in a
[50:57] negative way he's making you realize in
[50:59] a positive way hey I brought you from
[51:01] that you're not gonna have to go there
[51:04] anymore like I said before thank God for
[51:07] the revelation that I have that I don't
[51:09] have to stand before the judgement if I
[51:11] go through justification how can I be
[51:14] how can I be judged if I'm justified
[51:17] already now see you don't realize that
[51:20] when you first get started see that
[51:23] would be self justification if you say
[51:24] oh I'm just as justice God yes he will
[51:28] prove you wrong simpler down the road
[51:30] but if you come to the baptism of the
[51:32] Holy Ghost and you see that you've
[51:33] walked in this journey you look back and
[51:36] you say man I am as justice God is
[51:41] because the Bible says the just and the
[51:43] justifier in other words it's the same
[51:45] person just like the Sanctifier and the
[51:48] sanctified is the same person cuz this
[51:51] what is God work it's it's God literally
[51:53] working on you in a personal
[51:55] relationship he didn't send a third
[51:58] person or a second person or a first
[52:00] person he's the only person that deals
[52:01] with you as the Holy Ghost which is God
[52:03] in another form same Lord Jesus Christ
[52:07] the comforter he said I'll send the
[52:10] comforter in my father's name will the
[52:13] father didn't have a name father in the
[52:14] name the Lord Jesus Christ is his name
[52:16] that's why we believe in one true and
[52:18] living God not three persons or
[52:20] personalities as I was explaining this
[52:22] morning me and Bob Bob don't like to
[52:26] hunt he wasn't set in a deer stand if
[52:27] you paid him $5,000 but well maybe now
[52:31] well you ain't paying $50 to sit in a
[52:34] deer stand well that's his personality
[52:36] everybody got that but now me and
[52:39] brother Danny
[52:40] we'd pay $50 for setting a deer stand if
[52:44] it was a good one if it was a it was a
[52:46] good spot but it's different personality
[52:48] so so God came
[52:50] three personalities in the Godhead as
[52:53] people say they are into Trinity
[52:55] he can't have three personalities they'd
[52:58] be different somewhere they would be a
[53:00] clash but if you look in the Bible and
[53:02] you look in Jesus is life there never
[53:05] was a clash between the Father the Son
[53:07] and there's never a clash the Holy Ghost
[53:08] doesn't all all of a sudden look back
[53:10] and say why'd you do that
[53:11] no it's the same person so they have the
[53:13] same personality they have different
[53:16] avenues that they reach you in just like
[53:19] I'm a father because I have a son back
[53:22] there called Josh but I'm also a son
[53:24] because there's my dad and if my
[53:27] grandbaby was here today I would be a
[53:30] grandfather to her but how many people
[53:33] am i one and there's no conflict because
[53:37] that's me and so I am same way that's
[53:40] how that we believe in one true and
[53:42] living God in Jesus Christ is his name
[53:44] the position that he took as fatherhood
[53:46] in the Old Testament this is the this is
[53:48] Jehovah God talking to Abraham or Abram
[53:50] right all right so that same person not
[53:54] another second person in the Godhead
[53:55] came to be the son that person in more
[53:59] feed our change this form into the son I
[54:02] and my father are one
[54:03] he lied he said I and my father one he
[54:07] didn't say we just agree on every once
[54:08] in a while he said well if you're the
[54:10] same person see I don't have to disagree
[54:12] in deer-hunting cuz I love it okay but
[54:18] if I separate myself into Bob like the
[54:21] the three persons of the Godhead would
[54:23] be somewhere in the transition Bob's not
[54:27] gonna like deer hunting and I am so
[54:29] there's a conflict there's not a
[54:30] conflict between three gods it's one God
[54:34] with three manifestations and he has one
[54:37] named Lord Jesus Christ that's why we
[54:39] baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus
[54:41] Christ according to acts 2:38 and
[54:43] according to Matthew 28:19 that's what
[54:47] Jesus was saying baptized in my name the
[54:49] name of the Father father's not her name
[54:51] Sons on her name Holy Ghost is not a
[54:52] name it's positions of one person and if
[54:56] Jesus said I'll send the comforter in my
[54:58] name and I come in my father's name how
[55:02] many different names
[55:03] oh brother y'all way nice title as
[55:09] titles to a name Jehovah all these
[55:11] different things are titles to one name
[55:13] when he came on earth and took a human
[55:15] form to get us into this Kingdom he's
[55:19] talking about
[55:20] that's the Lord Jesus Christ and that's
[55:22] how we come I hope the whole family the
[55:24] Bible says his name Jesus Christ so why
[55:27] do I not want to identify I don't want
[55:30] to identify with the father they could
[55:31] billions of father there's billions of
[55:34] Suns there's billions of spirits but
[55:37] there was only one Lord Jesus Christ one
[55:40] not two or three there was only one Lord
[55:42] Jesus Christ and if all the family in
[55:44] heaven and earth is named after that
[55:46] then to identify myself when I go to the
[55:48] water to be baptized identify myself in
[55:51] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ go
[55:53] that's the family I'm fixing to go into
[55:55] alright they manage that alright I know
[55:59] we believe that but maybe somebody's
[56:00] watch maybe somebody I got a feeling
[56:02] that maybe somebody's watching in that
[56:03] had never watched it before so that's
[56:05] okay a lot of people sending home not
[56:07] doing much maybe they'll click on spoken
[56:08] word church you never know but God says
[56:12] look Abram I'm putting you to sleep
[56:14] every sinner deserves to go to hell
[56:16] blackness then after that of smoking
[56:18] burning furnace every sinner deserves
[56:20] Abraham that's what you deserve but
[56:23] beyond that one a little white light
[56:25] like I said before that little white
[56:27] light if you were spiritual enough which
[56:30] we weren't in our justification that
[56:32] little white light was right there with
[56:34] you the whole time
[56:35] there was an anointing there was a there
[56:37] was brother brown said we have angel to
[56:41] guide us new life that angels though
[56:44] it's not in here because it's not you
[56:46] didn't steer you into going to the bars
[56:48] and doing all the things you did but it
[56:50] was right here waiting on you to make a
[56:51] choice
[56:52] so what white light went between all
[56:55] that sacrifices watch but beyond that
[56:58] when a little white light that little
[56:59] white light went right between those
[57:01] pieces of sacrifice right back and forth
[57:03] the white light moving showing making a
[57:06] confirmation showing Abraham what he
[57:10] would do someday through his seed Isaac
[57:13] bringing on Christ for the supreme
[57:18] sacrifice so that little white light
[57:21] they followed you all your life that you
[57:25] really a lot of times ignored but it was
[57:27] there but there's a time when it comes
[57:29] where it gets closer and your walk of
[57:32] sanctification it got closer because
[57:35] Abram in this dream or vision he sees
[57:38] this white light and it goes down
[57:40] through the sacrifices where now as we
[57:42] continue on through our journey that
[57:43] white light disappears but it doesn't go
[57:47] away from you it goes in you just like
[57:50] this right here it goes inside of you so
[57:54] now that thing that that that watched
[57:56] over you all that time is now inside of
[57:59] you all right and we see that as a
[58:02] confirmation when we keep reading about
[58:04] the seal of circumcision that Abram
[58:07] comes to and gets his name changed
[58:09] because you know what as we walk through
[58:11] life you and I walk through life we were
[58:14] called sinner I don't care what your
[58:15] name was you were sinner you were Abram
[58:18] you were walking through life not know
[58:22] no rudder no you know I mean you had the
[58:25] boat you had the water you had ever the
[58:27] sails but you know what without a rudder
[58:30] without that little thing in the back
[58:31] that little guide to turn you the wind
[58:34] can take you over here and take you over
[58:36] here but when you got that spiritual
[58:38] rudder called the baptism of the Holy
[58:40] Ghost it'll lead you and guide you into
[58:43] all truth doesn't matter if the winds
[58:45] blowing in that direction you can take a
[58:46] hard rudder and you can go right
[58:48] straight into that wind if you've got
[58:50] that rudder all right
[58:52] everybody got that same man and then now
[58:56] look let's go to number three then
[58:58] hitting life in Christ and I'd like to
[59:04] stop here possible and tell you
[59:06] something on that you're a little
[59:07] Creator yourself cuz watch he said he'd
[59:10] give you a new spirit now that spirit is
[59:12] it God's Spirit that's your spirit God
[59:15] gives you a new spirit then he says I'll
[59:17] put my spirit in him but the thing God
[59:20] has to do is give you a new spirit make
[59:23] your nature a little more gentle and
[59:25] settle down or he couldn't even live
[59:29] with you
[59:31] so he has to get you fixed up first
[59:34] before he can come in he had to send
[59:37] Abram into a vision that Abram has
[59:41] nothing to do with this all these
[59:42] animals laying here and and like I said
[59:44] before Abram was awake when the
[59:47] sacrifices were made and he kept he kept
[59:49] the files away all them foul spirits
[59:53] that keeps trying to come back he's
[59:54] shoeing the files away but then God
[59:57] finally puts him to sleep says look
[59:59] Abram quit fighting let me take care of
[1:00:03] it because where there's a white light
[1:00:05] then fouls will leave when there's when
[1:00:09] there's good fresh meat to eat the fowls
[1:00:12] will leave all them foul spirits that
[1:00:15] used to be inside of here God's telling
[1:00:18] you fight them off because listen it's a
[1:00:20] fight you know that I know we all know
[1:00:22] that it's a fight when you first start
[1:00:24] in your Christian journey why because
[1:00:26] Satan is right here he wants you back
[1:00:27] man
[1:00:28] he wants you back you're his best
[1:00:31] soldier you've served me for
[1:00:34] 20-something years what's your problem
[1:00:37] and he gets mad but God don't get mad
[1:00:40] God's just going to okay do what you
[1:00:41] need to do and you come right Abram you
[1:00:43] need to come right back to Canaan until
[1:00:44] that's where I'm gonna bless you at you
[1:00:46] need to come back to the promised land
[1:00:48] remember my promise that's why brother
[1:00:51] Branham will tell us and you can see and
[1:00:52] we're gonna read it maybe mm-hmm where
[1:00:56] when we get over to when Paul starts
[1:00:58] talking about Abram said he staggered
[1:00:59] not at the promise of God and that's
[1:01:03] what he's gonna say to you thank me all
[1:01:06] the people that went away from the
[1:01:07] warden and then came back he's not gonna
[1:01:10] say what took you so long cuz he knew
[1:01:14] how long insane to start with but he's
[1:01:17] gonna say thank God my child you heeded
[1:01:22] the call and your mind I don't care if
[1:01:25] it took you 20 years I don't care what
[1:01:27] you did cuz remember once you come to
[1:01:29] justification the you ask God to chop
[1:01:31] off your past sins I don't care if you
[1:01:33] were an axe murderer
[1:01:36] whoremonger whatever you were God said
[1:01:39] I'll forgive you of your past if you'll
[1:01:43] let me justify you
[1:01:45] and you not justify yourself I did that
[1:01:48] because see that's justifying yourself
[1:01:50] that's why he's showing Abram all this
[1:01:52] look Abram you're gonna do this all you
[1:01:54] got to do is have faith that's why he's
[1:01:57] a face see debate were the face seat of
[1:01:58] Abraham
[1:01:59] that's why Abram to Abraham to even
[1:02:03] having the promised son God looked at
[1:02:05] him as if he did none of that wrong
[1:02:07] because he's gonna look at you how is he
[1:02:09] going to who can weigh the charge to
[1:02:13] God's elect
[1:02:16] it's God that justifies a man like I
[1:02:22] said before whoever if anybody ever
[1:02:24] brings you your past up and it's bad it
[1:02:28] ain't God God can't do that you said
[1:02:32] well God can do anything no God can't
[1:02:34] remember what he put in the sea of God
[1:02:36] forgetfulness he cannot remember that so
[1:02:41] he has to get you fixed up but first
[1:02:43] before he can come in what he's got that
[1:02:45] he's got that stony heart out he's got
[1:02:47] the heart of flesh now he's took that
[1:02:49] old nasty spirit out and give you a
[1:02:52] small gentler spirit so you can deal
[1:02:55] with yourself I'll give you a new spirit
[1:02:57] then you take him anywhere you go all
[1:03:01] kinds of places he's got to get you
[1:03:03] fixed so you can entertain him right who
[1:03:07] did we entertain before all this started
[1:03:10] the devil and we can't have the devil
[1:03:13] and God in there at the same time and
[1:03:18] then those God won't dwell an unclean
[1:03:20] vessel but we had come through this
[1:03:22] journey that we're coming through look
[1:03:24] at verse number 4 the Intervale notice
[1:03:29] you put a new spirit God has to give you
[1:03:32] a new spirit or you couldn't even get
[1:03:34] along with him you couldn't get along
[1:03:36] with yourself that old devil spirit you
[1:03:39] had in you and that's true how many
[1:03:41] times have we walked even when we coming
[1:03:43] towards not sanctification and them
[1:03:45] demons that keep coming back and the old
[1:03:48] flesh part of you and the old Adamic
[1:03:51] nature is still there and it's trying to
[1:03:54] lean back that way but you have to let
[1:03:57] go of the
[1:03:58] and let God as he did with Abram put you
[1:04:01] completely out of it because the old you
[1:04:04] will go back to it but if you'll just
[1:04:06] say I'm empty I'm empty guard are you
[1:04:10] going out to fill me up because I can't
[1:04:12] deal with this well that's what he's
[1:04:14] doing he's giving you a new spirit so
[1:04:16] he's got to put a new spirit in you so
[1:04:18] you can get along with his spirit I will
[1:04:21] put a new spirit in them and I will put
[1:04:23] my spirit in them he said after he's
[1:04:26] give you a new spirit that's you don't
[1:04:31] get it confused with God's Spirit it's
[1:04:33] not that's why I say to people that
[1:04:36] think once saved always saved you might
[1:04:38] have got a new spirit but it wasn't the
[1:04:40] Holy Spirit you got a new spirit to try
[1:04:42] to be a little more religious and Satan
[1:04:44] is the most religious person in the
[1:04:45] world besides God himself amen
[1:04:48] but you got to let die and let God take
[1:04:52] over and then he'll put the right spirit
[1:04:54] he'll put the right water in here all
[1:04:57] right
[1:04:57] don't get it confused with God's Spirit
[1:05:00] it's not it's your new spirit so you can
[1:05:03] get along with the Holy Spirit if he
[1:05:05] ever gives it to you and he will give it
[1:05:06] to you if you'll ask him all right so
[1:05:09] that's why we're coming now to Genesis
[1:05:10] chapter 17 if they want to pull that up
[1:05:15] we'll probably get 17 and 18 not going
[1:05:18] to get to adoption like we were thinking
[1:05:20] about doing but that's okay we got next
[1:05:23] week we can handle so let's read it for
[1:05:25] a minute let's see now when Abram was 99
[1:05:29] years old it's never too late it's never
[1:05:33] too late the problem was and the problem
[1:05:38] that was back in sanctification that we
[1:05:40] didn't cover is God told Abram you're
[1:05:43] gonna have a promise son but he never
[1:05:47] told him exactly how it was going to
[1:05:49] happen
[1:05:49] so Abram goes over in permissive will
[1:05:52] and says hey I can still perform in
[1:05:55] other words you understand what I'm
[1:05:56] saying and and me and Sarah never could
[1:05:59] have any kids so Sarah says okay take
[1:06:00] this Hagar woman see that was his idea
[1:06:03] they're all idea and it was part of the
[1:06:06] plan yeah sure guarding you about it but
[1:06:08] that wasn't God's promise because look
[1:06:10] God knew that the promised son had baton
[1:06:14] be between Abraham and Sarah not Abram
[1:06:17] and Sarah or Abram and Hagar and even
[1:06:22] when Sarah went down to Egypt or
[1:06:26] wherever they went and he was going to
[1:06:28] give her away God protected her because
[1:06:32] if that King would have took her his
[1:06:34] wife you understand what I'm saying
[1:06:36] it would have polluted what God said was
[1:06:38] going to happen he said you know you're
[1:06:39] gonna have that promise son but then
[1:06:41] when he comes to Abraham when we get
[1:06:43] into here right here he's gonna say okay
[1:06:45] now you're gonna take a name change
[1:06:50] Sarah contentious woman is going to now
[1:06:54] be a prince and you're gonna have it
[1:06:57] with Sarah and your ninety-nine years
[1:06:59] old at seventy five they might have had
[1:07:03] a chance now that's what God wants you
[1:07:05] to do every one of us he wants us lucky
[1:07:08] just like I just said in Genesis 15 we
[1:07:11] can't make God give us the whole ego but
[1:07:16] he will give it to those that are of an
[1:07:18] honest in the contrite heart the ones
[1:07:21] that lot will take it and have went
[1:07:23] through these three steps you got to go
[1:07:26] through those steps cuz Abram was the
[1:07:29] father of our faith if he had to go
[1:07:32] through it in a natural life you and I
[1:07:35] have to go to the same thing in a
[1:07:36] spiritual life everybody got that right
[1:07:39] and when Abram was ninety years old and
[1:07:42] nine he has quit trying to figure out he
[1:07:45] can have kids he's done he's gold
[1:07:50] his body's finished and he knew Sarah or
[1:07:54] Sarah he'd lived with her since they
[1:07:56] were 16 years old and they couldn't have
[1:07:58] kids to start with but he knew he could
[1:08:00] perform because he had a child with
[1:08:02] Hagar so he comes got this thing a
[1:08:04] little figured out but it ain't what God
[1:08:06] said kind of like we all do but the best
[1:08:08] thing to do is this watch stay in the
[1:08:10] word stay in the journey
[1:08:11] stay connected stay hooked up with
[1:08:13] church they hooked up with the Bible
[1:08:15] statehood up with listen to the prophets
[1:08:16] message stay hooked up with listening to
[1:08:19] live ministers somebody that can look
[1:08:21] you in the face
[1:08:22] that's why this is
[1:08:27] we are sheep we are herd animals we have
[1:08:30] to be led alright and when Abram was
[1:08:33] ninety years old and nine the Lord
[1:08:35] appeared to Abram and said unto him I am
[1:08:37] the Almighty God walk before me and be
[1:08:39] thou perfect
[1:08:41] he never said that daivam before because
[1:08:43] you knew Abram couldn't do it but now
[1:08:48] he's getting ready to bring him into the
[1:08:50] new birth and you say well then you know
[1:08:53] I can't first thing you tell people
[1:08:56] stuff like that and then especially
[1:08:57] people out in the world and they're not
[1:08:59] us is message believers cuz we've been
[1:09:01] taught different they just haven't been
[1:09:02] taught well they ain't nobody perfect
[1:09:04] you ain't perfect night perfect I'm not
[1:09:06] trying to be perfect but if I got the
[1:09:07] perfect guy inside of me he says I'm
[1:09:10] perfect I make human mistakes but he's
[1:09:14] telling Abram look walk before me and be
[1:09:17] thou perfect in other words I've
[1:09:18] sanctified you I'm getting ready to put
[1:09:21] you in service but I you're not perfect
[1:09:24] until you come to this new birth until
[1:09:29] you come to the filling and the sealing
[1:09:31] you're not going to be perfect but God
[1:09:33] says what before me and be thou perfect
[1:09:35] and I will make my covenant between me
[1:09:38] and thee and I will multiply thee
[1:09:39] exceedingly and Abram fell on his face
[1:09:42] and God talked with him saying as for me
[1:09:45] behold my covenant is with thee
[1:09:48] nobody else thee and thou shalt be a
[1:09:52] father of many nations now remember
[1:09:54] Abram meant hi father
[1:09:56] but Abraham literally means father of
[1:09:59] many nations so he's telling him right
[1:10:01] now he's gonna change his name right
[1:10:04] here because literally Abraham means a
[1:10:08] father of many nations neither shall thy
[1:10:12] name anymore be called sinner but thy
[1:10:18] name shall be Christian got it that's
[1:10:23] what he's saying he walked all them
[1:10:25] times as Abram now he's taking the name
[1:10:28] change and if that was me and you that
[1:10:32] would be the point we would go to the
[1:10:33] water and we'd be baptized in the name
[1:10:35] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:10:37] and become a part of that family of God
[1:10:41] be connected by look Abram thy name any
[1:10:48] more be called Abram but thy name shall
[1:10:52] be called Abraham thy name shall be mrs.
[1:10:54] Lord Jesus Christ all right
[1:10:57] not mrs. father son Holy Ghost that
[1:11:00] could be many fathers many sons many
[1:11:01] spirits but one the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:11:05] for a father of many nations have I made
[1:11:08] these 9 name shall be Abraham and I will
[1:11:10] make thee look at this i wills gut still
[1:11:14] in control here and I will make the
[1:11:17] exceedingly fruitful and I will make
[1:11:19] nations of thee and Kings shall come out
[1:11:22] of thee and I will establish my covenant
[1:11:25] between me and thee because Abraham
[1:11:27] didn't have a covenant he didn't make it
[1:11:29] God made it and Abraham come under that
[1:11:31] covenant you and I are under the that
[1:11:33] covenant now the seed of Abraham because
[1:11:37] look and I will establish my covenant
[1:11:40] between me and thee and thy seed after
[1:11:43] thee in their generations for an
[1:11:46] everlasting covenant to be a God unto
[1:11:49] them and to thy seed after thee and I
[1:11:54] will here's I will I will I will
[1:11:56] in other words you can interpret that as
[1:11:58] I am the I am is on the scene the I am
[1:12:02] will give unto thee into thy seed after
[1:12:04] the the land wherein thou art a stranger
[1:12:06] all the land of Canaan the promised land
[1:12:09] for an everlasting possession and I will
[1:12:11] be their God you see what he's making
[1:12:12] he's making that Abrahamic covenant of
[1:12:16] land grant because what does he give the
[1:12:19] seed of Abraham you and I are the seed
[1:12:22] of Abraham
[1:12:23] what's our possession after all this is
[1:12:25] said and done after all the sins done
[1:12:27] away with after all the sinners are
[1:12:28] already been sitting where they need to
[1:12:30] be sent after everything is all back up
[1:12:32] right again where do we get to go right
[1:12:37] here right here this is our possession
[1:12:40] as a seed of Abraham Abraham for an
[1:12:43] everlasting possession all the land the
[1:12:46] land where you are water pill I'm a
[1:12:49] pilgrim and a stranger right
[1:12:53] you know why strange because they're
[1:12:55] strange up there
[1:12:58] they think we're strange because we do
[1:13:01] all these weird things well guess what
[1:13:03] if God says they do strange things and
[1:13:07] we don't then I'm gonna tell you what
[1:13:09] God said God says we're a pilgrim and a
[1:13:12] stranger to them out there but he's
[1:13:16] given this land a land grant and God
[1:13:18] said unto Abraham now Abraham Christian
[1:13:21] now I'm I'm putting a lot of weight I'm
[1:13:25] putting a lot of things on you now
[1:13:27] because you're gonna have to do
[1:13:29] something you're gonna have to accept
[1:13:30] this you gotta accept it and God said
[1:13:37] unto Abraham thou shalt keep my covenant
[1:13:39] therefore thou and thy seed after thee
[1:13:42] in their generations this is my covenant
[1:13:45] which ye shall keep between me and you
[1:13:47] and thy seed after thee every man child
[1:13:50] among you shall be circumcised now that
[1:13:55] was a listen that's a type of the Holy
[1:13:58] Ghost but remember the Holy Ghost
[1:14:00] couldn't get into the believer in didn't
[1:14:02] Old Testament because the blood of bulls
[1:14:03] and goats covered their sin and and and
[1:14:09] waiting for Jesus Christ to die on the
[1:14:11] cross so he can release that life to
[1:14:13] come back inside that person everybody
[1:14:15] got that okay so this is a this is now
[1:14:18] it doesn't matter if you're physically
[1:14:20] circumcised or not it has no bearing
[1:14:23] whatsoever and Paul covers that in the
[1:14:26] New Testament he says circumcise Duncan
[1:14:28] circumcise he said it's a circumcision
[1:14:30] of the heart but to show a natural sign
[1:14:34] that you and I are supposed to show a
[1:14:36] natural sign as being a believer he'd
[1:14:42] give them a seal of circumcision I
[1:14:43] thought the other day listen to this
[1:14:44] this is really good I like this this God
[1:14:48] help me come up with this God came up
[1:14:50] with it and I just listened but you know
[1:14:53] what that is that's a secret sign it's
[1:14:58] in the private parts but
[1:15:02] it can be shown it starts in the private
[1:15:07] part the stillness of your heart one day
[1:15:10] you said God I want you in here I don't
[1:15:13] want you covering me here I want you
[1:15:15] inside here and it's a secret brother
[1:15:18] Brian said what is an individual affair
[1:15:21] with God but he was showing this to
[1:15:24] Abram why didn't he say well now we're
[1:15:26] gonna just you know maybe cut off your
[1:15:28] earlobe or or you know why do you have
[1:15:32] to be what it were it was it was in a
[1:15:34] private place and that's where God gives
[1:15:36] you the new birth in a private place but
[1:15:39] in that private place what they could do
[1:15:42] in the Old Testament if you met somebody
[1:15:45] and they were all dressed like a I say
[1:15:47] an Arab not meaning anything against
[1:15:49] that but dressed the part you're dressed
[1:15:51] apart they don't know if they're kindred
[1:15:55] or not they don't look alike but you can
[1:15:59] go take him in a secret place and you
[1:16:02] could physically show them that you were
[1:16:06] under that covenant and that you were
[1:16:08] circumcised so you were in this faith of
[1:16:13] Abraham or you weren't by the physical
[1:16:17] you understand what I'm saying by the
[1:16:19] physical looking but it was a seek you
[1:16:21] had to be in a secret part we're worried
[1:16:23] it's not just anybody and everybody know
[1:16:28] it was a secret thing and that's what he
[1:16:31] done with with this and I kind of like
[1:16:33] that because it is it's a secret affair
[1:16:34] with goddess but then though you can
[1:16:36] show it outwardly if anybody needs to
[1:16:39] know all you got to do is and say I'm
[1:16:42] under now the seal of circumcision you
[1:16:44] don't have to show them your whole flesh
[1:16:46] shows it same same hand that held the
[1:16:49] beer now holds the Bible God just
[1:16:52] cleaned it up and put it in service he
[1:16:57] didn't rip your tongue out because you
[1:16:59] cursed like a sailor
[1:17:00] no he just changed to what the inside
[1:17:04] part the private part he changed it and
[1:17:07] when he did then you can show it
[1:17:09] outwardly even in your natural flesh oh
[1:17:12] I love that this is my coven
[1:17:16] which you shall keep between me and you
[1:17:17] and thy seed every man child among you
[1:17:19] shall be circumcised and they shall
[1:17:22] circumcise the flesh of your foreskin
[1:17:24] showing that it was excess skin that
[1:17:27] didn't have any I guess you might say
[1:17:31] didn't have any value that's what
[1:17:34] they're saying but same way what did we
[1:17:38] have to do like what we have to do we
[1:17:40] had to cut off the old skin of the
[1:17:42] worldly stuff that we used to do not not
[1:17:45] physically just for the people on wine
[1:17:48] not physically but spiritually that old
[1:17:51] what give you the biggest problem it
[1:17:53] wasn't really your flesh it was the
[1:17:55] motivator inside but once you got a new
[1:17:57] motivator inside it changed your flesh
[1:18:00] you didn't have any excess demons
[1:18:04] running around if I got that and there's
[1:18:08] another thing you can say about this but
[1:18:09] I'm not gonna say here but it's an
[1:18:12] actually a showing it's just showing who
[1:18:14] you are she's showing what you've done
[1:18:15] it's actually a sacrifice Abraham was 99
[1:18:20] years old and he did it to himself
[1:18:22] because it was this natural sign to show
[1:18:25] that then Abraham did have to believe
[1:18:28] enough in God now listen everybody
[1:18:32] listening God wasn't standing in human
[1:18:36] flesh yet he was only speaking to
[1:18:39] Abraham and he's tells Abraham you got
[1:18:45] to go take and they didn't have surgical
[1:18:46] tools back then you see what the
[1:18:48] sacrifice you finally had to make he had
[1:18:51] then see Abraham believed that what he
[1:18:55] was doing was what God told him to do
[1:18:56] not what just some man or some voice out
[1:18:59] somewhere told him to do
[1:19:01] no he believed at that point of his life
[1:19:03] he looked and said well I'm not gonna be
[1:19:05] able many more I'm gonna be Abraham
[1:19:07] something's changed I've got something
[1:19:09] and now I can do something God tells me
[1:19:11] to do this and it's a it's a horrible
[1:19:13] thing it's gonna hurt it's gonna hurt I
[1:19:18] love my old friends but it's gonna hurt
[1:19:22] when God puts his self down inside here
[1:19:26] and then he takes that top and he seals
[1:19:29] that thing
[1:19:30] in or he takes a ceiling it's gonna hurt
[1:19:34] but it's gonna be what God says to do
[1:19:37] that seal of circumcision and you shall
[1:19:41] circumcise the flesh of your foreskin
[1:19:43] and it shall be a token of the Covenant
[1:19:45] between me and thee now see that
[1:19:48] covenant was not an eternal covenant it
[1:19:50] was an everlasting covenant it stayed
[1:19:53] until because remember even Jesus was
[1:19:55] circumcised remember the Bible tells us
[1:19:59] remember Mary was in the line to go have
[1:20:02] Jesus circumcised on the eighth day
[1:20:04] because that's what they told him to do
[1:20:05] because that they were he's part of
[1:20:07] Abraham's lineage seed not not total
[1:20:10] lineage but anyway that's where Simeon
[1:20:12] mater was in that line and she was going
[1:20:15] to be circumcised and she had the two
[1:20:17] turtledoves as she took brother Brown
[1:20:18] explains that very well but look and he
[1:20:22] that is eight days old now watch it for
[1:20:24] those of you that don't know online and
[1:20:26] for those of you that do we're gonna
[1:20:27] refresh seven days is old creation right
[1:20:30] seven days God created the world in
[1:20:32] seven days there are seven church ages
[1:20:34] there are seven spirits of God there are
[1:20:36] seven different things which means
[1:20:37] completion in the Bible but when you
[1:20:39] come to an eighth day and you use that
[1:20:41] eight and they even turn it around flat
[1:20:44] to make it show eternity because there's
[1:20:47] no ending to it so we know that that we
[1:20:51] are we we as born-again believers are
[1:20:54] circumcised on the eighth day which puts
[1:20:57] us into the eternity when you're born
[1:21:01] again when you're boarding in the day
[1:21:03] you're born again bro is that you're
[1:21:04] just as eternal as God is you're just as
[1:21:07] eternal as God ever was and ever will be
[1:21:10] and man so you're in an eighth day so
[1:21:12] see he shows a type that he that is
[1:21:16] eight days old why'd he say four three
[1:21:21] six wine even say seven he said on the
[1:21:25] eighth day you've come into a holy
[1:21:28] convocation with God as we see there in
[1:21:31] Leviticus it talks about an eighth day
[1:21:33] seven days you'll do these things and on
[1:21:35] the eighth day now remember there's no
[1:21:37] eighth day for those of you there online
[1:21:39] there's no eighth day
[1:21:42] it's just that's the first day again
[1:21:44] it's a continual one two three four five
[1:21:45] six seven one two three four five six
[1:21:47] seven but when you enter into that next
[1:21:49] cycle man cycle is seven God cycle has
[1:21:53] to recycle again because it's eternity
[1:21:55] so the eighth day is just the first day
[1:21:57] over again everybody got that right so
[1:22:01] you not we now are in an eternal loop
[1:22:05] everybody's born again you're in an
[1:22:07] eternal loop that's brother Dale's
[1:22:08] talking about the mind of Christ that is
[1:22:10] the eternal loop because your old Adamic
[1:22:13] nature of mind we're gonna live we're
[1:22:17] gonna have problems and we're gonna die
[1:22:20] that's why we've been taught since we
[1:22:22] were babies because we'd go to funerals
[1:22:24] we'd go out and see this but when you
[1:22:27] get the mind of Christ that puts you in
[1:22:28] an eternal part there's an eternal part
[1:22:30] now of you that can never die a man that
[1:22:33] can never die so you're in an eight-day
[1:22:35] holy convocation that the world knows
[1:22:38] nothing about all right excuse me and he
[1:22:41] that is eight days old shall be
[1:22:42] circumcised among you and every man
[1:22:44] child in your generations he that is
[1:22:46] born in a house are bought with money of
[1:22:48] a stranger which is nothing seed he is
[1:22:50] born in the house he that is bought with
[1:22:52] money much needs to be circumcised and
[1:22:54] my covenant shall be in your flesh
[1:22:56] because remember he could only anoint
[1:22:58] the flesh of those people he couldn't go
[1:23:00] down inside to get in their soul to make
[1:23:03] that the new birth but it is an absolute
[1:23:05] type of the new birth now since Jesus
[1:23:09] Christ went to the cross and gave his
[1:23:10] flesh release the life the eternal life
[1:23:14] that was in him he released that like
[1:23:16] Bill adele's talking about that mind of
[1:23:18] Christ that the part of God that sure to
[1:23:20] play I'm gonna say this but it's not
[1:23:26] with God anymore it's you and God
[1:23:30] because you were back in him before the
[1:23:33] foundation of the world in a thought or
[1:23:35] an attribute now you've been brother
[1:23:37] Brahm tells us in in hood in Melchizedek
[1:23:39] he said now you've been displayed you're
[1:23:42] not up here anymore
[1:23:43] you've been displayed but according to
[1:23:47] matching pieces of brother Dale preached
[1:23:49] in 1995 that piece though that piece of
[1:23:53] the puzzle that's gone has got to
[1:23:55] reconnect
[1:23:56] to make it the fullness of the Godhead
[1:23:59] bodily the fullness is the bride pieces
[1:24:03] coming back together to this one place
[1:24:06] because remember if if you were eternal
[1:24:09] back then you're eternal now the
[1:24:12] attribute became to you the only way we
[1:24:15] could get here though whispers is
[1:24:17] because of the sex act that happened in
[1:24:19] the garden that caused fall between
[1:24:21] Satan and the Beast the man so we came a
[1:24:25] little different way by permissive well
[1:24:28] this did but the eternal was always
[1:24:32] eternal and if he knew you accept it in
[1:24:34] two thousand nineteen or twenty whatever
[1:24:36] it was it was right there he didn't go
[1:24:40] away but when you received it where to
[1:24:44] go it went to you so now you're a piece
[1:24:46] of the puzzle that God don't have in the
[1:24:50] dimension he's in now you're in this
[1:24:51] dimension but you're going to connect
[1:24:54] back to him in that dimension that's why
[1:24:58] we all have to go away the bride has to
[1:25:02] go away with the bridegroom to the
[1:25:05] wedding supper and then with what we do
[1:25:07] we connect all back together if I got
[1:25:10] that we're not gods not leaving any
[1:25:12] pieces down here once we take a rapture
[1:25:15] all the pieces go right back to where it
[1:25:17] started from
[1:25:18] amen we just took this with us to show
[1:25:21] the devil that God can live in human
[1:25:24] flesh and be perfect because God said
[1:25:29] walk before me and be thou perfect all
[1:25:33] right hey BAE okay with that all right
[1:25:36] mm-hmm my covenant shall be for an
[1:25:38] everlasting covenant and the
[1:25:39] uncircumcised man child whose flesh of
[1:25:41] the foreskin is not circumcised I was
[1:25:43] now what happened was is if you were in
[1:25:47] a crowd and mingling around and you
[1:25:50] wanted to go in the temple remember they
[1:25:52] have that problem in the New Testament
[1:25:53] one of them Timothy or one of them
[1:25:55] wasn't circumcised because you had to
[1:25:58] show yourself you had to unveil you had
[1:26:04] to unveil yourself before the man and if
[1:26:07] you weren't circumcised in the New
[1:26:08] Testament
[1:26:09] one of them got in trouble or Peter
[1:26:11] because he took somebody in there that
[1:26:13] wasn't certain they thought so much of
[1:26:15] that that was a literal thing that they
[1:26:17] held on because look I told him to under
[1:26:21] the Old Testament God told them that's
[1:26:24] what you get to do in other words that
[1:26:26] sure new birth to show people that you
[1:26:29] have separated yourself from the
[1:26:31] Gentiles because Gentiles didn't care
[1:26:34] all right and the uncircumcised man
[1:26:37] child his flesh of his foreskin is not
[1:26:39] circumcised that soul shall be cut off
[1:26:43] from his people he has broken my
[1:26:47] covenant that's what happened to me and
[1:26:49] you when we came by the sex act between
[1:26:51] mom and dad which was allowed by God
[1:26:54] right it was allowed by God but he got
[1:26:58] you here so that you can display the
[1:27:02] Covenant that God now is living in my
[1:27:07] circumsized inside not outside inside my
[1:27:11] circumcise the inside and now I can show
[1:27:14] the world through this flesh that God
[1:27:16] can live in a human body and be perfect
[1:27:21] regardless whether you believe that or
[1:27:23] not I believe that if he told Abraham
[1:27:25] walk before me and be thou perfect and
[1:27:28] then Jesus tells us in the New Testament
[1:27:33] be therefore perfect even as my father
[1:27:38] in heaven is perfect
[1:27:39] and God said unto Abraham ask for Sarah
[1:27:41] thy wife we're gonna stop right here we
[1:27:42] didn't even get to chapter 18 we will
[1:27:44] start with chapter 18 next week because
[1:27:48] remember somewhere along the line you're
[1:27:51] gonna meet God in human flesh
[1:27:55] and you're gonna realize it's God
[1:27:57] talking to you and man doesn't matter if
[1:28:01] it's this man this man this man this man
[1:28:03] this man who you're gonna meet God in
[1:28:05] human flesh and that person is going to
[1:28:07] bring you a direct message and you're
[1:28:10] gonna understand more than you've ever
[1:28:11] understood before brother Lewis he'll
[1:28:13] tell you that you don't mind me telling
[1:28:16] that he didn't think he had the new
[1:28:18] birth before he came to this church but
[1:28:21] when he came to this church he got the
[1:28:22] new birth by listening to God in human
[1:28:25] flesh is that okay I hope we all realize
[1:28:30] that I hope we all come to realization
[1:28:33] that God you spoke to me and then
[1:28:37] everybody there's not a person in this
[1:28:40] building but you and that's who God was
[1:28:43] speaking to directly that day and then
[1:28:48] maybe it's not Louis's day anymore he's
[1:28:51] had his day he's had a circumcision you
[1:28:53] don't go reser kamsani same one here
[1:29:00] once and done but you got to be
[1:29:01] circumcised but next time it was bozek's
[1:29:05] time or other rinds or any of us it was
[1:29:08] our time what did God come to us and
[1:29:10] said look circumcised think of that
[1:29:13] you're gonna you know what you gonna do
[1:29:16] remember I told you last week when you
[1:29:19] get circumcised that ninety years old
[1:29:21] see we were all circumcised as babies so
[1:29:23] really didn't even you know not rly you
[1:29:27] understand what I mean but if you would
[1:29:29] waited til something I've talked to a
[1:29:31] few this waited too late thirty years
[1:29:32] old and because of medical reasons they
[1:29:34] had to be circumcised wasn't fun so the
[1:29:39] longer you wait the worse it is
[1:29:43] everybody get born again real early I
[1:29:45] wish not and a hope for the young kids
[1:29:49] that we that that happens if God can get
[1:29:51] to you first and you go through that
[1:29:53] circumcision but what happens is is you
[1:29:55] walk different a physical male when
[1:29:58] these circumcised at that age he
[1:30:00] physically walks different well that's
[1:30:02] what God's telling them say look you're
[1:30:04] gonna walk different you're gonna walk
[1:30:07] you're gonna be light like I said with a
[1:30:09] Jacob Jacob had a name change to Israel
[1:30:11] but he had to fight with an angel the
[1:30:15] angel had to smite him on the thigh and
[1:30:17] then he became the limping Prince so
[1:30:19] everybody that knew the world knew Jacob
[1:30:22] this was Jacob but now everybody that
[1:30:25] knew Israel after that that he had been
[1:30:27] with God
[1:30:28] oh he walks different and that's exactly
[1:30:35] what they say right let's say they tell
[1:30:37] us how you've walked different why
[1:30:38] you've been circumcised and God said
[1:30:42] unto Abram Abraham as for Sarai thy
[1:30:45] contentious wife the one that gave you
[1:30:49] Hagar and the one that won't you know
[1:30:51] that you know I can't do this so I'm
[1:30:52] gonna give it to somebody else
[1:30:54] you shall not call her Sarah anymore but
[1:30:57] Sarah princess shall her name be and I
[1:31:02] will bless her now he's never said that
[1:31:04] before never has he said anything about
[1:31:08] even Sarah
[1:31:09] he was Abram Abram Abram but now that
[1:31:12] Abraham's name's changed to Abraham he
[1:31:15] needs a bride with the name change amen
[1:31:20] and he said unto Abraham for Sarah thy
[1:31:23] wife that contentious old person we used
[1:31:27] to be contentious everything was
[1:31:29] contentious right but now you're gonna
[1:31:32] be Sarah and you're gonna get the
[1:31:34] blessing now look and I will bless her
[1:31:36] and give the son also of her Abraham I'm
[1:31:40] giving you the whole plan of redemption
[1:31:43] right here you and this woman Sarah are
[1:31:49] going to have that promise I gave you 25
[1:31:51] years ago and I will bless her and give
[1:31:55] thee a son after her yea I will bless
[1:31:57] her and she shall be a mother of Nations
[1:31:59] kings of people shall be of her then
[1:32:03] Abraham fell upon his face and laughed
[1:32:05] now look this is like I said before you
[1:32:07] know you you first get born again you
[1:32:08] remember you've just been circumcised so
[1:32:12] it hurts a little bit so Abraham fell
[1:32:15] upon his face and laughed and sitting
[1:32:17] this in his heart shall a child be born
[1:32:19] unto him that is a hundred years old
[1:32:20] shelf Sarah there's none here
[1:32:22] sieze he's back to circumstances again
[1:32:24] but he turns everything back around
[1:32:27] because Abraham sending all that
[1:32:29] instrument may live before the ash boy
[1:32:31] ain't got nothing to do with it it
[1:32:35] smells out of the picture now Ishmael
[1:32:36] gets a blessing but it ain't too blessed
[1:32:38] it's not the blessing that Abraham and
[1:32:40] Sarah is gonna bring to the world which
[1:32:42] is Jesus Christ we know that right and
[1:32:45] Abraham said unto God oh that Ishmael
[1:32:47] may live before then God said look did
[1:32:52] he say no Abraham no Abraham that's not
[1:32:56] what he just not didn't even pay
[1:32:58] attention to what he said same way with
[1:33:01] God
[1:33:02] remember gods knows of the best yeses we
[1:33:04] ever gets a lot of times but God said
[1:33:06] Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son
[1:33:09] indeed and thou shalt call his name
[1:33:11] Isaac so Ishmael is out of the picture
[1:33:13] now and I will establish my covenant
[1:33:15] with him for an everlasting covenant and
[1:33:17] with his seed after him and as for
[1:33:19] Ishmael I've heard thee behold I have
[1:33:22] blessed him he's going to bless the
[1:33:25] foolish virgin he's gonna bless the
[1:33:26] people of be giving eternal life they're
[1:33:28] a part of the plan they're actually a
[1:33:32] part of the mind of God but not to part
[1:33:34] you an hour they're part of the thinking
[1:33:37] of God not a part of the mind of Christ
[1:33:40] okay
[1:33:41] thereby okay with that behold I blessed
[1:33:44] him and will make him fruitful and will
[1:33:46] multiply him exceedingly twelve Prince's
[1:33:48] shall he beget and I will make him a
[1:33:50] great nation but but my covenant will be
[1:33:57] with Isaac which Sarah shall Behrend
[1:34:00] early at the set time in the next year
[1:34:02] and he left off talking with him and God
[1:34:04] went up from Abraham Abraham took
[1:34:07] Ishmael and all that was born in his
[1:34:08] house and all that was bought with his
[1:34:09] money every male among the men of
[1:34:11] Abraham's house and he circumcised the
[1:34:14] flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame
[1:34:16] day he didn't wait two weeks he didn't
[1:34:20] wait two months that day God told him
[1:34:23] that's the day he did it same way with
[1:34:25] you and I don't lollygag around if God's
[1:34:28] getting ready to give you something take
[1:34:29] it there likes do like Mary and say be
[1:34:32] it unto me Lord according to thy word
[1:34:33] I'll take it give it to me
[1:34:35] and
[1:34:36] smell his son was 13 years old women and
[1:34:38] Abraham was ninety years old and nine
[1:34:39] when he was circumcised in the flesh of
[1:34:41] his foreskin and Ishmael his son was 13
[1:34:44] years old when he was circumcised in the
[1:34:46] flesh of his foreskin so you see in a
[1:34:50] type
[1:34:50] there's Ishmael the Ishmaelite group
[1:34:52] that we think so bad and rotten which
[1:34:54] they are contentious and they do fight
[1:34:57] and they are going to but remember they
[1:34:59] come under the same covenant they
[1:35:02] receive circumcision now not here on
[1:35:04] earth I'm throwing spiritual now not
[1:35:07] here on earth you and I have received
[1:35:09] circumcision by the new birth now they
[1:35:12] get circumcision at the white zone
[1:35:13] judgment
[1:35:14] basically if you if you call
[1:35:16] circumcision the new birth they won't
[1:35:18] get the new birth and you birth is you
[1:35:20] were born a human you come to a new
[1:35:23] birth you must be born again on this
[1:35:27] earth and either you die or we take a
[1:35:28] body change and go in the rapture now
[1:35:31] they are born not Ishmael live Ishmael
[1:35:36] all through their life but at the very
[1:35:38] end they're circumcised are given the
[1:35:42] Holy Ghost not a new birth because a new
[1:35:44] birth means they were born and then they
[1:35:46] got a new birth see that's what's
[1:35:48] special I hope y'all see this if you
[1:35:50] don't see anything else the new birth is
[1:35:52] the most special thing because you were
[1:35:56] once dead in your natural life walking
[1:36:00] through the earth thinking you the most
[1:36:01] of a lot of people in the world you just
[1:36:03] didn't get ready to come but you're not
[1:36:04] you're dead is a hammer right inside but
[1:36:09] God thought enough of you to bring you
[1:36:11] Abram through Abram into Canaan all the
[1:36:15] mistakes you make all the things that
[1:36:18] happen in your life God is leading you
[1:36:20] and then he births you a new he rebirths
[1:36:27] you not like not like who was it I gotta
[1:36:33] go back get my mother's won't see he was
[1:36:35] talking natural Jesus said no you gotta
[1:36:38] be born from above well then well then
[1:36:41] he should have said he should have said
[1:36:45] well where's that
[1:36:46] no he just didn't understand it but you
[1:36:49] and I understand
[1:36:49] that we are born from above and then
[1:36:52] when God gives us the new birth that
[1:36:54] makes us a new creature that makes us
[1:36:56] sons and daughters of God the bride of
[1:36:58] Jesus Christ and all these different
[1:37:00] things but Ishmael is going to be
[1:37:02] circumcised but he's got there people
[1:37:05] that people the foolish virgin a cup of
[1:37:07] water my name people are given eternal
[1:37:08] life they were born and never got a
[1:37:11] rebirth they never were born again so
[1:37:15] they go through life and they die and
[1:37:17] they have to come up with white throne
[1:37:18] judgment but what they have to do is is
[1:37:20] they have to give an account of what
[1:37:22] they did you and I never have to do that
[1:37:25] if you're born again today that old
[1:37:28] circumcision remember that circumcision
[1:37:30] you don't ever get circumcised again and
[1:37:33] man
[1:37:33] god never accounts that back to you
[1:37:36] backwards but to Ishmael and hid the
[1:37:40] Ishmael group they have to come up and
[1:37:42] God has to give them eternal life now
[1:37:47] it's the same eternal life we get but we
[1:37:48] get it here that's the difference we get
[1:37:52] it right here on this godforsaken covin
[1:37:56] 19 earth that we're living in but
[1:38:00] they're gonna have to wait go through a
[1:38:03] judgment stand at the white throne
[1:38:05] judgment and be given eternal life the
[1:38:07] Bible says the books were open and they
[1:38:08] were judged by their own works I don't
[1:38:10] will be judged by my works I want to be
[1:38:13] judged by the works at Calvary where God
[1:38:16] took my place and God's the one that
[1:38:18] said to me walk before me and be thou
[1:38:20] perfect I want to be circumcised in that
[1:38:26] secret place but I want to be able to
[1:38:29] show the world that something happened
[1:38:31] that I walked different and that in
[1:38:34] chapter 18 the Lord is finally going to
[1:38:38] not just talk to Abram not talk to
[1:38:41] Abraham he's going to appear before a
[1:38:44] man so let's stand to our feet god bless
[1:38:46] you
[1:38:47] hope you enjoyed that I enjoy I'm kind
[1:38:52] of like brother Jimmy Gibson if you
[1:38:53] can't talk about nobody talking about
[1:38:54] Abraham you can't go wrong when you
[1:38:57] start talking when you start talking
[1:38:58] about you need this that when you start
[1:39:00] talking about Abraham you can't go wrong
[1:39:02] because you know what you are there
[1:39:03] faith seed not natural seed you're the
[1:39:06] faith seed of Abraham cuz in all this
[1:39:09] right here now sure it may look like to
[1:39:11] the natural world that tells us a lot of
[1:39:13] things he didn't believe but what
[1:39:14] happened he kept walking he kept going
[1:39:17] through the things in life he kept going
[1:39:20] through him and he went through them
[1:39:23] it's going through a problem it's what
[1:39:26] gets you out on the other side going
[1:39:28] through something gives you the victory
[1:39:30] if you stop and say I'm done I can't do
[1:39:32] this no more that's not a victory you've
[1:39:34] stopped walking now God just keeps on
[1:39:38] going and somebody's gonna come right
[1:39:41] there with him
[1:39:42] let it be me and you let's sing a song
[1:39:44] sing I think God for the lighthouse it's
[1:39:47] 348 in spiral 348 mm-hmm 348 my life to
[1:40:09] here
[1:40:10] [Music]
[1:40:12] Jesus is the light paths and from the
[1:40:20] rocks of said he has shown his light
[1:40:27] around me that I could clearly see that
[1:40:36] if it wasn't for that Lila tell me where
[1:40:44] would she be for the light
[1:40:54] I owe my life to Him
[1:40:59] well I have some strategy you can depend
[1:41:03] on it says the lighthouse and from the
[1:41:10] rocks of Sydney has shone his light
[1:41:17] around me that I could clearly see if it
[1:41:26] wasn't for that Lila
[1:41:32] tell me where were delicious feed thank
[1:41:38] God for the White House thank you today
[1:41:43] was Ohio my life beauty before Jesus is
[1:41:53] I like
[1:41:57] and from the rocks of Sydney has shown
[1:42:04] his line around me I could clearly see
[1:42:13] that if it wasn't for that lighthouse
[1:42:20] little me where would this ship see a
[1:42:26] man he's shown his lot he's given us how
[1:42:29] in the world we are known Abram and
[1:42:32] Abraham if it hadn't have been for a
[1:42:35] prophet God sitting in time that that
[1:42:38] was an example now we can take examples
[1:42:41] of Abraham of being faithful and all
[1:42:43] being all these different things but for
[1:42:44] to put it and were when you read it in
[1:42:47] the Bible
[1:42:48] that you put your own personal spiritual
[1:42:51] experience through what happened with
[1:42:54] Abram when you were just a sinner out in
[1:42:58] the world listen you were a sinner that
[1:43:00] was your name you weren't you know you
[1:43:03] you were rying the center I was weighed
[1:43:06] the center now by the new birth by being
[1:43:10] reborn now it's the same Ryan I see but
[1:43:15] now it's riding the Christian and the
[1:43:18] whole world can see that the each one of
[1:43:21] us have had a name change everybody
[1:43:24] wants to talk about name changes why we
[1:43:25] already got one we went from Abram to
[1:43:28] Abraham I mean we already had a name
[1:43:30] change according to the Bible we went
[1:43:32] from Abram to Abraham we went from
[1:43:34] Center to Christian we're mrs. Lord
[1:43:36] Jesus Christ we are accepted into the
[1:43:38] family we are the bride we all will have
[1:43:41] an intimate mate that we can be with
[1:43:43] called the Lord Jesus Christ so thank
[1:43:45] God for the lighthouse and thank God for
[1:43:47] y'all being here today I want to say
[1:43:50] those of you that are at home Lord bless
[1:43:52] you I wish everybody could come but if
[1:43:54] we're all get together and pray they got
[1:43:57] to stay this thing and that that as they
[1:44:01] did in the Old Testament that that as of
[1:44:04] right now the the Spirit of God is going
[1:44:07] out and and stay in this thing and
[1:44:09] keeping it down too
[1:44:10] minimum so that we can all get back at
[1:44:12] least have a little semblance of life
[1:44:13] even though this may be heading toward
[1:44:16] the end who knows I mean this is not the
[1:44:18] apocalypse now we know that because
[1:44:19] we're not even folks to be here so I
[1:44:21] mean I thank God for that even you know
[1:44:24] you'd you look in the denominational
[1:44:26] world they tell you you got to go
[1:44:28] through tribulation period
[1:44:29] well my Bible don't say that I don't
[1:44:32] know if I'd want to listen something
[1:44:34] like that to tell me I got to go through
[1:44:36] now sure we go through little things
[1:44:38] that we got to go through but I'm
[1:44:39] talking about when the tribulation hits
[1:44:41] that's the wrath of God this is not the
[1:44:45] wrath of God this is because sinners
[1:44:47] because we're sin laden in our body okay
[1:44:51] if we'll understand that it's what
[1:44:54] happens to a it's a virus it's it's a
[1:44:58] virus it's something that started
[1:45:00] somewhere and then it keeps going from
[1:45:02] human being to human being well you know
[1:45:05] what I want a virus I do I want to be
[1:45:10] infected with the whole ego and being in
[1:45:13] fact it makes me affected and may make
[1:45:16] us effective in this world - what I'm
[1:45:19] saying is let's pray for those people
[1:45:21] out there let's not condemn this one in
[1:45:23] that one any other can't stand anybody
[1:45:25] condemned and I don't care if it's a
[1:45:27] filt this guy on the face of the earth
[1:45:28] if he's in that position it's like
[1:45:30] brother Dale said you honor that
[1:45:32] position I don't want to hear no bashing
[1:45:34] of Trump or whoever you want to talk
[1:45:36] about I really don't care but he's doing
[1:45:39] the best he can as a human being and
[1:45:41] they ain't nobody in that position for
[1:45:44] him and you you want to put yourself in
[1:45:45] it I don't know not at this moment I
[1:45:49] don't but I see because all this world
[1:45:51] is not ours we let them run the cosmos
[1:45:54] our world order and let them but you
[1:45:56] know what brother I'm never said he said
[1:45:58] don't pray for America
[1:46:00] he never said don't pray for the leaders
[1:46:02] or the leadership he even stopped the
[1:46:05] service one time and prayed for Dwight
[1:46:06] Eisenhower because they told him he had
[1:46:08] a stroke or heart attack and they were
[1:46:10] taken to a hospital he stopped the
[1:46:11] service and he said you pray for those
[1:46:13] people the Bible tells you to pray for
[1:46:14] Kings pray for those who have the rule
[1:46:18] over you if you condemn them I am I
[1:46:21] doubt to experiences the Christian
[1:46:23] I really do because that's being totally
[1:46:26] selfish but this is the crisis that we
[1:46:29] and help your neighbor help your
[1:46:32] neighbor in this in this thing help you
[1:46:34] know do do the best you can what you got
[1:46:36] Jim had a bunch of cloth that was she
[1:46:40] had put up somebody give her just bolts
[1:46:42] and bolts of cloth I think it was math
[1:46:44] maybe Matthews Wow anyway she had all
[1:46:47] that and they were getting there making
[1:46:48] surgical masks so she's sending it to
[1:46:50] Gainesville so they could make some
[1:46:51] surgical math do what you can don't just
[1:46:54] sit back and say no God just protect me
[1:46:56] and my for no more well you know what if
[1:47:01] you're that way you're selfish and with
[1:47:05] toilet paper now be careful with the
[1:47:07] toilet paper don't hoard it okay but if
[1:47:10] you need some go bite I think everything
[1:47:13] will be okay after a while but we're
[1:47:15] just gonna pray that that's what God's
[1:47:16] gonna do he's gonna he said he'd never
[1:47:18] leave us never forsake us he'd do he
[1:47:20] what he takes care of his kids first
[1:47:21] never brother mom said one time he said
[1:47:23] you know all of heaven is praising God
[1:47:25] and the angels are shouting and
[1:47:27] everything's going on and all of a
[1:47:28] sudden God says shut up I hear one of my
[1:47:32] children needs need something hole
[1:47:36] heaven hush just because one person hit
[1:47:39] their knees and said father I need
[1:47:41] something from you that's how important
[1:47:44] you an hour
[1:47:44] we're not important in ourself God's
[1:47:47] made us important a man so we need to
[1:47:49] believe that and go forward not do
[1:47:52] anything stupid you're not doing
[1:47:53] anything foolish
[1:47:54] don't tempt God the Bible says so we're
[1:47:57] not going to tempt God but let's do the
[1:47:59] best we can with what we got I pray to
[1:48:01] God that somebody will come up with a
[1:48:02] vaccine or some person will be anointed
[1:48:06] to go up here to that hospital and just
[1:48:08] lay hands on the sick and they all
[1:48:10] recover I truly believe that God can do
[1:48:12] that and I'm praying that somebody will
[1:48:16] get desperate enough that will will stay
[1:48:19] this thing and it won't get its work any
[1:48:21] worse than it is and we'll get back to
[1:48:22] our some part of our life like I said
[1:48:24] the world's doing the best they can
[1:48:26] they're running on fumes now they're
[1:48:28] everybody's running on fumes up every
[1:48:30] nation is like us they just the United
[1:48:32] States broke everybody's broke but this
[1:48:35] is where we know that who
[1:48:37] is going to come up with the gold that
[1:48:39] that's sitting on the gold over there
[1:48:41] and think of it that's the worst place
[1:48:43] is hitting now but they're sitting on
[1:48:47] the gold of the world and all they're
[1:48:48] gonna do is say okay if you'll do this
[1:48:50] it's kind of like I'm gonna say this one
[1:48:52] time that the bill they passed the
[1:48:55] Democrats had all kind of little jump
[1:48:58] they put in that bill when then Clinton
[1:49:01] coming close Clinton excuse me
[1:49:02] Trump looks at him and says what we got
[1:49:04] to do you know it's give-and-take and it
[1:49:06] all it is it's giving takee it's not
[1:49:08] it's not cut and dry you had to give
[1:49:10] them a little bit you know a little bit
[1:49:12] of compromise well listen God don't
[1:49:14] compromise but all that compromising is
[1:49:17] putting stuff attached to those bills
[1:49:18] and they're passing them and like
[1:49:20] brother Dale has always said they're
[1:49:21] gonna lay there on those books until
[1:49:23] they need them and then when they need
[1:49:25] them they're gonna say oh remember back
[1:49:26] in 2020 we passed that one trillion
[1:49:29] dollar well we also put in there that
[1:49:31] y'all can't even have Church anymore
[1:49:33] you can't assemble unless you unless you
[1:49:36] have a sign of a Catholic Church you
[1:49:40] know you understand what I'm saying
[1:49:41] because they take over and they say this
[1:49:43] is what you got to do we own you now
[1:49:46] it's not China we thought won't try to
[1:49:49] own this one I don't know if China owns
[1:49:51] us now or not I think it's the strings
[1:49:53] are being pulled from other places but
[1:49:55] we know that we read the news we know
[1:49:57] that's what's gonna happen so just
[1:49:59] realize that we're heading toward the
[1:50:01] end time we're closer than we ever have
[1:50:03] been it's obvious tomorrow we can say we
[1:50:07] closer than later for Ben okay but we
[1:50:09] see the things happening to put in place
[1:50:11] that we would think like brother Dale
[1:50:12] he'd sit down and try to think then you
[1:50:13] go man one little virus we shut this
[1:50:15] shut the whole world down one little
[1:50:17] virus has shut the whole world down for
[1:50:21] this moment of time what else can happen
[1:50:23] but I promise you the bride of Jesus
[1:50:25] Christ will prevail because we got a
[1:50:30] covenant now an eternal covenant which
[1:50:33] is the baptism of the Holy Ghost we
[1:50:35] don't work under temporary covenants the
[1:50:38] Covenant with me and you was made back
[1:50:40] before the foundation of the world and
[1:50:42] it can't can't ever fail you remember
[1:50:46] that online it God can never fail and if
[1:50:49] you got God inside of you
[1:50:51] you can't fail either let's bow our
[1:50:52] heads to Heavenly Father thank you for
[1:50:54] this day thank you for the opportunity
[1:50:56] we have Lord to speak to your purchase
[1:50:58] possession Lord we pray that what we've
[1:51:00] said has been pleasing to you Lord and
[1:51:02] it will help us all to grow a little bit
[1:51:04] closer to you father we do pray and you
[1:51:06] know in our heart you the Prophet said
[1:51:08] he you know our heart our heart is set
[1:51:10] on Lord that something will happen to
[1:51:13] stay this thing Lord or they'll find a
[1:51:15] vaccine or they'll find something Lord
[1:51:17] to stop this because human beings are
[1:51:19] dying human beings are dying they're
[1:51:21] crying out for help and they don't know
[1:51:23] who to cry to Lord I pray that you'll be
[1:51:26] their comforter Lord in the time of
[1:51:27] trouble then I think about all the
[1:51:29] different ones that are that are passing
[1:51:31] away in the different hospitals and not
[1:51:33] even have family members around them
[1:51:35] they're just dying alone father what a
[1:51:37] horrible thing of dying but to be to die
[1:51:40] alone but Lord we know as Christians we
[1:51:43] don't die alone
[1:51:44] we have you there with us and that
[1:51:47] you'll protect us and lead us and guide
[1:51:49] us and Lord truly protect us here
[1:51:52] protect some of the older ones brother
[1:51:54] Dale and all the different ones that
[1:51:55] that are older and more susceptible to
[1:51:57] these things Lord we ask you to give
[1:52:00] them a another angel to super protect
[1:52:04] them and keep them strong because we
[1:52:06] need everybody here Lord thank you for
