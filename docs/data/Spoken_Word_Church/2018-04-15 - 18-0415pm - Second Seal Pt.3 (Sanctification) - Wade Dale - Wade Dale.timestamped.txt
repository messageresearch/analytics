[6:10] bright
[6:11] we'll be changed to clouds and rain

[6:22] in that city

[8:45] and when free from Toland
[8:48] when
[8:49] [Music]
[8:51] [Applause]
[8:53] and then wonderful city you know what
[8:56] it's just ahead of us
[8:57] just keep walking amen there's gotta
[9:00] make a little vote and announcement I
[9:02] first off it'd be hard to keep up with a
[9:05] record of what birth that we were
[9:07] because everywhere I went all I had to
[9:10] prove I was born was a family bible and
[9:14] there was 13 names on that list Sam and
[9:19] Hannah Dale and children and I was the
[9:22] last one so I was the 13th one and
[9:25] that's why the mix-up was that they went
[9:29] by the 15th because it wouldn't another
[9:31] day to the next day when the doctor
[9:33] assigned him the birth certificate he
[9:35] put April the 16th 1 a.m. so among them
[9:38] didn't count it till the next day so it
[9:40] didn't matter but that was a reason I
[9:42] had that and see that way I get two
[9:43] birthdays you didn't catch that Terrence
[9:48] was paid to say that but he didn't do it
[9:50] I supposed to get to presidency you know
[9:54] and now let's stand up and then we'll
[9:56] finish self cuz we got a little vote our
[9:59] sound system not to sound system in here
[10:01] as much but our video system that we're
[10:05] using to transmit the messages you know
[10:07] throughout the internet system is you
[10:11] know is it needs to be updated because
[10:13] that some of you you know you you're
[10:16] listening in and doing when you do you
[10:18] have a lot of of doings that you know it
[10:21] don't work too good and also we're gonna
[10:24] try to get in to get a new system to put
[10:28] it to where you can get better to do it
[10:30] called part of it is one time parts
[10:32] another so it's gonna cost a good bit of
[10:34] money so I've already talked with the
[10:36] trustees and they said okay everything's
[10:39] fine for us to go ahead and do it but we
[10:41] do we vote to make it a official to work
[10:43] that somebody don't come along so well
[10:45] this that we make it official for you
[10:48] you know that we do so all in favor of
[10:50] upgrading our sound system would you
[10:53] signified by the raising of you and all
[10:57] opposed any other same sign okay then
[11:01] we'll go ahead and the brothers can get
[11:03] set on doing it to try to get everything
[11:05] coated well
[11:06] expensive you think this is a small
[11:08] operation but it's really not it comes
[11:11] with a lot of thousands of dollars to
[11:13] change the system around to get
[11:15] everything to go in but you know it's
[11:18] it's dire so we'll take care of all
[11:20] right game that so let's just saying
[11:22] open the eyes and my heart brother this
[11:23] white comes to minister the word of the
[11:26] Lord unto it open I want to see
[11:49] open the eyes of my heart the warm open
[11:55] the eyes of my heart I want to see
[12:00] [Music]
[12:02] I wanted to see you to see you shining
[12:16] in the light of your glory pour out your
[12:22] power and love as we sing holy holy holy
[12:30] high and lived a love shining in the
[12:37] light of your glory pour out your power
[12:43] and love as we sing holy holy holy
[12:49] hey man you love him today holy holy
[12:55] holy
[12:58] [Music]
[13:00] holy holy holy holy holy I want you to
[13:10] see a man a man gonna be in the house of
[13:15] the Lord good to have everybody back
[13:17] everybody doing what you're supposed to
[13:21] do taking care of what's going on
[13:23] brother right Gabriel's here with us
[13:24] today blessings and heart good to see
[13:25] him today it seemed every day yeah good
[13:35] to see you buddy good to be here today
[13:38] got all the musicians here playing and
[13:44] like brother Louie said it is kind of
[13:46] when you tell people that your pastors
[13:49] been the pastor for 40 some-odd years
[13:51] they they kind of don't believe you you
[13:56] know because you know especially a
[13:58] little hometown we're from we got one
[13:59] church that we came out of in 1968 I
[14:01] mean they they don't even get them into
[14:04] parsonage till they get them out so and
[14:06] that's the truth
[14:07] yeah they go through a preacher about
[14:10] ever two three years probably and that's
[14:13] that's probably a long tenure in that
[14:15] church so it's good to be here and know
[14:20] that like brother Louie said that though
[14:22] that the message has been preached and
[14:25] hadn't been deviated since that time I
[14:29] tell you I if you read that thing that
[14:33] we got and it's a woman it's not a man
[14:36] it's a sister in Tokyo but she's the
[14:40] Filipino and Wow
[14:42] you ought to read some of the doctrines
[14:43] that she's been exposed to and it's same
[14:48] old no Holy Ghost thing it's like you
[14:50] know until 1963 it wasn't you didn't
[14:53] have the Holy Ghost that you but you
[14:54] didn't have the Holy Ghost until you
[14:55] died
[14:57] this is in the message you got the Holy
[15:00] Ghost when you died and that puts you in
[15:02] a sixth dimension now how easy is that
[15:04] Wow
[15:06] you know you live the way you want to I
[15:08] guess and then
[15:09] I don't have a clue it to me to me to me
[15:13] a false doctrine is rough but the truth
[15:16] is the truth the true stays all the way
[15:19] through Genesis from Genesis to
[15:21] revelations and I was I'm not on
[15:26] Facebook but I do have a Facebook page
[15:28] for my beekeeping then something popped
[15:30] up from a believer not too long ago and
[15:32] I couldn't believe what the believer
[15:33] believed was that when you got the Holy
[15:37] Ghost just like you know like brother
[15:39] Dale said some people's when you got the
[15:40] Holy gone you do get everything you need
[15:42] for your journey but this statue of a
[15:44] perfect man thing and all this other
[15:46] stuff I mean they the guy even said that
[15:48] Peter listen to this how this even Peter
[15:51] was under stress when he wrote first
[15:54] Peter about add to your he was under
[15:57] stressed by the Romans or somebody in
[15:59] that area to cause him to write that I'm
[16:03] like my heavens and this is a message
[16:06] believer this ain't somebody out in the
[16:07] in the in the world you know it and it
[16:10] just thank God for the truth thank God
[16:14] for the truth I don't want to stay a
[16:15] baby you want stay a baby I don't want
[16:17] that baby I mean like neither staying
[16:21] with us you know Nellie
[16:22] yeah I'd hate to have to you know bottle
[16:26] feeder at 14 years old
[16:29] 15 years old sorry see she's saying 15
[16:33] there cuz why she wants to drive she's
[16:35] mature same way with a Christian I want
[16:38] to be you know I want more of God and I
[16:41] think if you have God in you you'll have
[16:42] a desire to want more of God amen so we
[16:45] we're just fortunate to to have the
[16:49] truth so let's get started with the Book
[16:51] of Revelations I hope you still enjoying
[16:53] the the seals the second seal that to me
[16:56] is a very wonderful seal it's red it
[16:59] talks about sanctification and and today
[17:02] we're going to kind of get into it just
[17:04] a little bit deeper enough I saw
[17:06] something they I'm kind of weird like
[17:10] Ryan's not here but he said that my
[17:15] lawnmower last year you know my
[17:17] lawnmower I always preach them a
[17:19] lawnmower and get things I'm sitting on
[17:20] a lawn mower so that's my holy of holies
[17:23] I guess there's the mail Jeep now
[17:25] because I saw something other days I
[17:26] wasn't even thinking about it and it
[17:28] just come to me so we'll try to share it
[17:30] with you maybe a little bit this
[17:31] afternoon some but just remember this

[19:43] somebody saying that that Peter wrote
[19:46] first Peter or second Peter out of
[19:48] duress
[19:51] please good heavenly day he was being
[19:55] influenced by somebody to write the Word
[19:59] of God
[20:00] oh please no well you know what that
[20:04] does that makes you lazy if you got
[20:07] everything when you believe then you

[20:12] have to study because you got it
[20:14] no you're just deceived and you ain't
[20:17] got it
[20:18] I'm sorry cuz if you got it whatever is
[20:21] inside of you is gonna make you want
[20:23] more when you get to where you don't
[20:26] want no more of God you're either going
[20:28] on into another dimension or you're just
[20:31] lost
[20:31] hey man that alright revelation 6 verse
[20:35] 1 didn't get you standing here by saw
[20:37] when the lamb opened one of the seals I
[20:39] heard it were the noise of thunder one
[20:40] of the four beasts saying come and see
[20:42] now I want you to correlate this and
[20:45] make sure you remember what brother Dale
[20:46] is talking about the for life messengers
[20:49] that restored the word are these beasts
[20:52] that we're talking about the lion the ox
[20:55] the man in the eagle that's what
[20:56] restores what the cankerworm pom worm
[20:59] locust and caterpillar eat these guys
[21:01] which is the holy ghost in the believer
[21:04] is restoring the truth now the truth
[21:10] never left it just remember I read you
[21:13] the quote word brother Branham said the
[21:14] that the Holy Ghost had been bound by
[21:18] Creed's and dogmas for 2,000 years a man
[21:22] at the door of Creed's and dogs in the
[21:23] door he meant a door he met a church
[21:25] amen
[21:26] of Creed's and dogmas but it's been to
[21:28] be released hey man so this message at
[21:31] the end is a release it's to get us out
[21:34] of here it's not to go into another
[21:36] church age there's no more hey man so we
[21:39] can't shovel it back I guess that guy
[21:42] that was on the internet he just wanted
[21:43] to shovel it back you know well I don't
[21:45] need it I'll just shovel it to somebody
[21:47] else I don't know I just I just
[21:51] understand that it commits baffles and I
[21:54] saw him behold a white horse and he that
[21:56] sat on him had a bow and a crown was
[21:57] given him he went forth conquering and
[21:58] to conquer and we know what that is
[22:00] that's that white righteous church now
[22:03] this is where we had today and when he
[22:05] had opened the second seal I heard the
[22:07] second beast which was what the Ox say
[22:10] come and see and there went out another
[22:11] horse that was red now same rider but
[22:14] another horse which horse is the power
[22:17] it's the power of the people a man and
[22:20] power was given to him that sent their
[22:22] own to take peace from the earth and
[22:23] that they should kill one another and
[22:26] there was given unto him a great sword
[22:28] or a great word and you may be seated in
[22:30] the Lord at his blessing to the reading
[22:31] of the work brother Danny help me get
[22:37] this right here thanks sir hey bye all
[22:42] right say ma'am hey ma'am good day today
[22:45] got some liquid sunshine going on
[22:47] outside
[22:47] good song Louie sang let it rain rain
[22:50] rain and I was listening to it raining
[22:52] out the back that's all right
[22:59] I just hope it quits at about 5 o'clock
[23:05] because I got about 30 something
[23:08] packages of bees I got to pick up and
[23:10] deliver and put it in the mail tomorrow
[23:12] so you pray that they'll all get there
[23:13] safe I never had a problem before but
[23:16] you never know so now we've looked at
[23:19] the first seal in the first seal
[23:21] covering the first three ages amen and
[23:24] then we've got a lap over here because
[23:26] remember this one ended 606 so we were
[23:29] laughing it over bringing the second
[23:31] seal in excuse me and that will be the
[23:34] ops which was what was this age here
[23:36] that was that dark age or that was the
[23:39] age that Columba was the messenger and
[23:42] we'll read all that in just a minute but
[23:44] let's pull this back up one more time
[23:45] and see Redemption we got to see the
[23:50] plan of redemption now I want to show
[23:53] you something today that we want to that
[23:56] I don't think I made to clear the other
[23:59] day
[24:03] now what are we dealing with here this
[24:05] is what the three rings now this is all
[24:09] for illustrate old though I'm sorry the
[24:12] same guy was talking about saying that
[24:16] this was some kind of pyramid message
[24:18] listen the reason this is here is for
[24:21] illustration that alright this is for
[24:24] illustration purposes only we don't
[24:27] believe in a pyramid scheme or a pyramid
[24:31] teaching even brother Branham that was
[24:33] one when he said he said now I'm not
[24:35] talking about this pyramid teaching
[24:36] that's rotten okay so this is not
[24:39] pyramid teaching this is something comes
[24:41] from God it took a prophet though to
[24:44] place this is that Alright Paul I mean
[24:49] Peter couldn't place it he could live it
[24:52] but he couldn't place it in place that
[24:54] encodes look remember Peter was right
[24:57] down here this had not happened yet the
[25:00] church ages and whether and if he had
[25:04] not ever conferred could converse with
[25:07] John John hen went to Patmos when he
[25:10] preached second Peter I say priest he
[25:12] was preaching it right so he didn't know
[25:15] anything about these church ages he
[25:16] probably never even heard that he was in
[25:18] a these interchange I mean we got to
[25:21] think things like that he just knew that
[25:24] God gave him a commission to preach the
[25:28] Word of God feed my sheep feed my sheep
[25:30] feed my lambs Peter Peter Peter preached
[25:34] to my people and then and he said Peter
[25:37] I prayed for you because he knew Peter
[25:39] had a problem he said Satan is gonna
[25:41] sift you like sand
[25:43] but Peter what about Almighty God prayed
[25:46] for a man o mighty God prayed for you
[25:49] hey man before the foundation of the
[25:53] world he prayed for you hey man
[25:55] so let's don't worry about this and say
[25:57] this is some kind of a well My heavens
[26:00] this is this in the Bible he gave some
[26:03] apostles prophets pastors teachers and
[26:05] evangelists for what the perfecting of
[26:07] the Saints for the edifying of the body
[26:08] that we may want grow up
[26:11] right I don't I just baffled who said
[26:18] that it's just so too simple is what it
[26:22] is it's too simple listen folks God can
[26:31] be understood by the things you do or
[26:34] you can't understand it amen the Godhead
[26:37] the Bible says is even what explained
[26:40] are are given to us by the things we see
[26:43] I'm a father I'm a son I'm a preacher
[26:46] I'm a postal employee I've got many many
[26:49] titles but today when I ride a $3,000
[26:52] check I'm not going to put postal worker
[26:57] I'm gonna put Samuel wait down the
[27:00] second thankfully I'm gonna make Jim do
[27:02] it but I mean what would they cash it
[27:06] hey I'm gonna catch the title God's not
[27:11] gonna catch the title gonna cash your
[27:15] check with his name on it so this is the
[27:18] statue of a perfect man this man that's
[27:22] our example I like the one I wish we had
[27:24] the one I think Joe and hims got it were
[27:27] Christ is standing in here coach because
[27:30] he's the but where the body and he's the
[27:33] head I don't have a problem with this I
[27:35] just I just know that some people do
[27:38] have a problem with it I don't have no
[27:39] problem with it I like to see that I
[27:43] have a path that I can grow up in God
[27:45] and that God brought a seventh grade
[27:47] education man to put this together for a
[27:52] seventh grade education man to put it
[27:55] together for us I don't have a problem
[27:57] with that
[27:58] amen so now as we look I don't like to
[28:04] use black not when it comes to God no
[28:06] more use red because we're on the red
[28:08] horse but when you're born again you're
[28:12] filled out right you're sealed in a man
[28:17] look you're so sealed Satan can't get in
[28:21] and got King leave you
[28:25] now he's working his way out but he
[28:28] can't leave you I'll never leave you or
[28:31] forsake you
[28:32] so we're filling up with God that's what
[28:35] I said here look the breaking of the
[28:36] cells is not an answer serving for the
[28:37] Soul souls were deemed by the new bird
[28:39] now what is redemption of the new burnt
[28:41] one is the part of the new birth
[28:43] justification just can't st. kids
[28:47] baptism the Holy Ghost amen
[28:49] that all right this is your holy of
[28:52] Holy's right so look I believe yes
[28:58] that's the Holy Ghost that's God
[29:02] Almighty in human flesh your flesh right
[29:05] here perfect perfection amen eternal
[29:14] those who he's justified he's already
[29:16] glorified I think another day that was
[29:20] one thing I was thinking when I don't
[29:22] know what I was thinking about nice
[29:24] thing about male I guess and that power
[29:28] lays within you and you say well
[29:32] so-and-so went by the grave that power
[29:37] that he has or she has never diminished
[29:44] we get it opposite we think always so we
[29:47] know that's the power that's the power
[29:50] that lies inside of a person to know
[29:54] that you rest in an eternal condition
[30:02] and you got it while you were here you
[30:06] didn't have to get the Holy Ghost after
[30:08] you died heavenly days where did that
[30:10] come from
[30:11] well I do know where it come from that
[30:15] horse rider that's still riding in a
[30:19] white righteous church called a message
[30:30] so truth anyhow because look when the
[30:36] sales break it reveals Jesus Christ but
[30:40] it exposes the Antichrist it shows you
[30:43] where he is if what he's doing now we're
[30:46] talking we say why you're talking about
[30:47] these ages you ain't even got days
[30:48] number seven please it all culminates in
[30:52] our age everything culminates in our age
[30:56] the seals afterwards you look at
[31:00] Jerusalem then you look at the plays
[31:02] then you look at the vials and you look
[31:03] at the wolves it's all right here we're
[31:08] at the door we're at the threshold of
[31:10] this thing amen
[31:12] so now what are we talking about now
[31:14] listen two-fold thing God if you're born
[31:18] again your soul is complete like I said
[31:21] you're resting you're resting you're not
[31:25] even resting in homes but I'll hope you
[31:28] spent on him oh no I'm gonna spit all
[31:34] over and you said that does that go
[31:35] right yeah that part yeah I was about to
[31:40] he's about to get spit all over but we
[31:42] rest in and you should rest now
[31:47] where's fear in this where's fear that
[31:51] that's why that's why that and I'm gonna
[31:54] be just real honest with you down to the
[31:57] church agents there was a fear there was
[31:59] a well maybe well I don't know well
[32:02] there was a shadow there was a exist
[32:06] riders this from we come to the age in
[32:09] this message where this is right
[32:13] there's nothing else this is right what
[32:17] we're telling you is right whether you
[32:20] hear from me or whoever else it doesn't
[32:21] matter this message in his purity is
[32:24] right there's your silver sure that
[32:29] doesn't say statue of an imperfect man
[32:31] it's the stature of a perfect man
[32:34] this man's perfect amen
[32:39] cuz he pushed the old nature out and
[32:43] he'd come right in amen
[32:46] so the old you is dead there actually is
[32:49] no old you if there's an old youth and
[32:53] you've got I may be getting off a steal
[32:59] a little bit but it's gonna fit I
[33:01] promise you that's why I said divorce
[33:05] means listen I'm just going to be
[33:07] marital imagine if you're divorced today
[33:12] naturally you got to live in something
[33:15] somewhere else a man I know I got people
[33:19] sitting here the same way but listen and
[33:21] they ain't physically dead they're still
[33:23] alive so you can't marry again I'm just
[33:28] what the Prophet said amen but now if
[33:31] that person's dead then you're free to
[33:36] marry then there was it just a
[33:39] divorcement of a person moving him out
[33:41] and putting them over here no it's
[33:44] called eradicate it's called killed like
[33:49] Louise says it was taken by force and
[33:53] the old you is dead there is nothing
[33:57] left of you Jim you don't have to wash
[34:02] my clothes but there's nothing left of
[34:06] you it's all him but now look that's
[34:12] where we're standing at the breaking of
[34:14] these seals because your soul is
[34:16] redeemed amen
[34:18] right now if you're born again your soul
[34:20] is just as eternal as God is
[34:23] one day we're gonna realize that and see
[34:27] the power that lays inside but what's
[34:30] our problem here's our problem we got
[34:35] this big old crust that we build and
[34:42] it's called memory reason conscious
[34:48] affection imagination I never could
[34:54] remember imagination Jim told me one
[34:55] time she said imagine that so I can
[34:59] remember imagination now cuz I run them
[35:01] through I go memories and conscious
[35:02] affection she says imagine that so I
[35:04] know what imagination is but look that's
[35:07] not in here now that all works together
[35:10] listen kids if you're taking cut
[35:13] yourself horizontally you're not gonna
[35:17] see three rings we're not like a tree
[35:20] hey man because your body is what your
[35:23] soul your soul that you everything's
[35:25] connected alright now what we got to
[35:28] deal with and remember we're not going
[35:30] to deal with this let's take this out of
[35:33] the picture all right cuz it only does
[35:43] what that says do so we're not worried
[35:46] about the boat the skin of the boat
[35:49] we're not worried about the metal we're
[35:51] not worried about the the mast and up no
[35:54] that's just that's just a part that
[35:56] holds everything together actually this
[35:58] skin is holding what is inside me
[36:00] together and then you know it's your
[36:03] biggest organ in your body science class
[36:06] this is your biggest organ is your skin
[36:09] because it holds everything together
[36:10] alright
[36:12] joy can be a vessel for honor or
[36:15] dishonor remember we got it in the Bible
[36:18] so this is the realm that we got to deal
[36:21] with
[36:21] now look Satan can penetrate because of
[36:25] the fall nice thing about this the other
[36:30] day because remember Adam Adam was
[36:33] sealed in his soul was eternal he was
[36:35] sealed in
[36:36] but something happened in that next
[36:39] realm that's so close it's not way out
[36:41] here it's right that's my brother M do
[36:44] the three circles okay there's no gap I
[36:49] like what Paul said I think I got it in
[36:51] here where Paul says I pray that your
[36:53] whole body soul and spirit be made
[36:56] blameless hey man so he knew that there
[36:59] was coming a time that because he stood
[37:02] there one day and he said the things I
[37:03] would not I do the thing now what's he
[37:05] talking about this man no sir
[37:08] no ma'am he was talking bout this guy
[37:11] this guy's the things I would not I do
[37:13] the things I do it would not it's not in
[37:16] the flesh it's in the spirit realm so
[37:19] the spirit realm is what this is dealing
[37:21] with and then it's God trying to do this
[37:25] remember brother mom said flus what
[37:28] God's trying to do is make little
[37:29] avenues I'm gonna make five of them so
[37:34] what so he can get out cuz remember
[37:44] Satan can't get in there he can play in
[37:47] this court right here amen he can't go
[37:54] in this way but he sure can't get in
[37:58] this and play so that's what the part
[38:02] that's the only part way out to deal
[38:03] deal with you say well I'm grieved in my
[38:06] spirit okay what are you talking about
[38:09] or you agreed because of something that
[38:12] that you see is wrong or is it something
[38:16] you did wrong because you can't do wrong
[38:19] in your soul if you're born again you
[38:22] can only do wrong in your spirit realm
[38:24] so the spirit realm to me is what's
[38:27] causing God to open the seal so that we
[38:31] can see that not that this man look this
[38:34] man this man is not developing then
[38:44] inside the inside is not developing he's
[38:47] not God in a in a
[38:49] portion yet he said well yeah yeah but
[38:52] the look the same teaspoon of water
[38:57] you've got the full ocean in your hand
[39:00] but you've got a portion but remember it
[39:03] doesn't have to develop another chemical
[39:06] to be the ocean water it still has all
[39:10] those chemicals in it it's just that you
[39:12] can't put a whale in it but you can put
[39:16] a whale in the ocean that's what God
[39:18] wants God wants us to what put a whale
[39:21] in this ocean he wants to have enough
[39:23] water where he can work amen that's why
[39:28] I said when you're when you're born
[39:30] again my folks rest have no fear right
[39:37] what can you fear but fear itself
[39:43] Christian didn't say that amen but what
[39:47] is there to fear but let's open the
[39:51] doors and let gone out Wow listen you're
[39:57] still a free moral agent amen you're
[40:00] still a free moral agent and the Holy
[40:02] Ghost is very timid he's gonna stay
[40:04] right here remember the woman with the
[40:09] three behalf she's satisfied she's
[40:14] satisfied she's got the Holy Ghost she
[40:16] goes to church she loves God but there's
[40:19] more of God to want and down through the
[40:21] church ages like we're showing now down
[40:23] through these church ages they were
[40:27] satisfied sure they wanted more of God
[40:32] you understand what I mean but but you
[40:34] look even the songs that were developed
[40:36] over in here when I die hallelujah by
[40:39] and by all these things about dying they
[40:41] knew they were gonna go to grave Paul
[40:43] even knew he was gonna go to a great
[40:45] because that was the call of the age but
[40:49] now that thing inside of Paul never said
[40:52] that there's no death speaking of death
[40:55] in God
[40:57] none he didn't create death but death is
[41:04] the product of what the sin that man did
[41:06] in what in this part right here so this
[41:12] is what we're working on we're working
[41:14] on this spirit realm of man in these
[41:17] seven seals because remember that man
[41:23] right there when Adam lost fellowship
[41:27] with God he lost it because this came
[41:32] became stronger than what was inside of
[41:36] him that's all I can say it just became
[41:40] where it overwhelmed what he was
[41:42] thinking because we're look people you
[41:45] can't make God a sinner you can't make
[41:47] you even think bad thoughts God never
[41:50] had a bad thought now he knew you would
[41:53] but it was never a part of him he never
[41:57] had a bad thought he never sinned now he
[42:01] knew of sin but all down to the church
[42:05] ages man knew sure everybody knew there
[42:10] was coming a time when God was going to
[42:13] be able to work through a group of
[42:14] people and to work through that group of
[42:20] people like brother Nels preaching the
[42:25] word came alive straight from God in
[42:28] this first church age straight from God
[42:30] Almighty the first three and a half feet
[42:32] the last three and a half years of his
[42:33] ministry he laid it in those disciples
[42:37] knowing he was leaving but knowing that
[42:41] they were going to pick it up and carry
[42:43] it on they meant so he had to lay it in
[42:47] him so there was no like we've thought
[42:50] about there's there's no denomination
[42:54] Amen because listen I stay but this is
[42:59] what I was thinking about the other day
[43:00] when I was driving down the road I was
[43:02] trying to put the second seal in with
[43:05] the Ten Commandments now look
[43:10] the second seals right here right what
[43:14] did they do watch the second seal thou
[43:17] shalt have no graven images no idols
[43:23] what did they do in that age right there
[43:27] they took mercury down and put Paul up
[43:30] they took one down and put another one
[43:32] up then the Pope became their Idol they
[43:38] did exactly what God told him not to do
[43:41] in that second seal is exactly what
[43:45] happened they started putting up when
[43:49] that red horse rider remember he was
[43:51] given a sword so he was given a word to
[43:52] tell the people well that's what
[43:54] elevated a title all right like in like
[43:59] in the case of of the children of Israel
[44:02] Moses said we're not golden calf come
[44:04] from Aaron you're my preacher
[44:09] I'm the Prophet I've been gone for a
[44:12] little while I'm back now and there's
[44:14] this image standing here in my camp
[44:17] where did it come from Aaron said said
[44:23] now brother you're not gonna believe
[44:24] this but my doctrine is hello somebody
[44:30] my doctrine is that thing just jumped
[44:33] out of the fire and I'm sure Moses went
[44:39] you preaching a false doctrine Aaron let
[44:42] me straighten you out
[44:44] so you instead of just throwing it into
[44:46] the fire
[44:47] I believe he sprinkled it and made him
[44:49] eat it right didn't he sprinkle ashes
[44:52] and made him eat - hey you make it you
[44:55] eat it same way today you make it you
[44:59] eat it but the breaking of the seals
[45:01] then is not necessarily for the soul so
[45:03] we're coming to a place to where no one
[45:05] else has been before it's aware that
[45:07] your spirit can be can be used of God to
[45:14] get you somewhere why it will bring full
[45:20] fellowship
[45:21] why can't I fellowship with God my
[45:24] memory comes up my reasoning comes up
[45:33] imagination
[45:34] there's no imagination in God but there
[45:39] is memories and conscious affection
[45:41] imagination all right the man so to me
[45:45] that's what I want us to instead of just
[45:47] looking at these seals like we were
[45:49] talking about you know this is the seal
[45:52] right here that's okay this is the seal
[45:56] but the seals been broke the seals been
[46:00] broke now I want to see what God's gonna
[46:03] do behind the seal I want to see what
[46:06] he's because look the seal us knowing
[46:11] what the seals are is not going to
[46:13] change our body but it will help us to
[46:17] see that God's already done stuff for us
[46:20] that we haven't realized that's why I
[46:23] was thinking - that went brother Dale
[46:26] was talking about cuz it's reading the
[46:28] reading the questions and answers on the
[46:31] seals this was Saturday before he
[46:34] preached the Seventh Seal on Sunday he
[46:36] said it's gone from you you're not
[46:38] getting it in other words so you're
[46:41] you're not you're not an astronaut
[46:46] you're your your mental ability now not
[46:52] naturally but your mental ability of the
[46:56] word that's been preached to you you've
[46:58] got some comes remember when brother
[46:59] bottoms up there preaching he's talking
[47:02] about one God everything you restored
[47:04] back to the faith of the fathers but
[47:06] you've got 90% of the congregation
[47:09] Trinitarians so what are they going back
[47:13] to they're leaning back to their own
[47:15] understanding that they had before and
[47:17] he's not doing them any good unless they
[47:22] accept what he said that's why I told
[47:24] him on the sing sale he said you're not
[47:26] getting it's not for you
[47:27] networks there's too much messing up
[47:29] your spirit realm you have the Holy
[47:32] Ghost I'm not
[47:34] 9 they didn't have the Holy Ghost cuz
[47:36] remember I read you one quote we said
[47:37] yesterday Christian yes there Christian
[47:40] and now are going to heaven but worked
[47:43] on my body chain we're talking about
[47:46] seeing something that no one has ever
[47:47] seen before is to live it's not God
[47:54] everybody all right I thought I might
[47:58] stop for a second just to let us realize
[48:00] that that middle realm memory reason
[48:03] conscious faction imaginations that's
[48:05] our problem so that's what these sales
[48:08] are for is their loss for the redemption
[48:10] of the body listen when your spirit
[48:12] realm gets turned and it becomes more of
[48:15] God your body will change you know why
[48:21] your body's not changing now dick can
[48:25] get up out of the seat and tell you why
[48:33] you know that song the things I used to
[48:36] do I do them no more there's a lot to
[48:37] that right I mean really so what is it
[48:43] it's our memory it's our reasoning we
[48:44] our reasoning that we're dying
[48:47] somebody's gotta break that Abraham
[48:52] ninety nine years old he tried his whole
[48:56] 25 years to produce what God said he was
[48:59] going to produce finally when he got to
[49:02] where he could not produce nothing his
[49:03] body was dead I believe one day he
[49:07] finally said god I can't do this he said
[49:11] if you'd have said that 25 years Abraham
[49:13] you two had that child 25 years ago
[49:15] amen so he's got to get us to a place to
[49:18] where we're dead and the memory reason
[49:22] conscious affection listen we're not
[49:24] going to be zombies Louie we're not
[49:28] gonna be zombies like the world is but
[49:30] you take what the world is cousin is
[49:32] dead they're alive while they're dead do
[49:36] you know what the Bible says but I want
[49:38] to be that way I want to be allowing
[49:39] Christ
[49:41] while I'm dead the life that I now live
[49:45] I live by what the faith of the Son of
[49:48] God I want to tell you something here
[49:50] and I'm gonna put it in then we'll go
[49:51] back over it one more time if you'll
[49:54] notice as we come into sanctification
[49:56] now remember justification under the
[49:59] seals is the real you didn't do it right
[50:01] so now that has nothing to do with you
[50:04] God did that God can only justify you
[50:10] you can try to justify yourself all
[50:14] right but ain't gonna do no good but
[50:16] when God says when God says you're
[50:22] justified then it's nothing you done you
[50:26] accept what he did but now watch though
[50:29] when we get a sanctification I'm a
[50:32] region scripture you've got something to
[50:35] do right you got something to do because
[50:39] if you want that unclean spirit to stay
[50:41] where it's at
[50:42] it'll stay right where it's at but if
[50:45] you're tired of it it'll go away
[50:48] hey man it's something these are these
[50:52] are these are God's virtues but you know
[50:54] what it's something you do you can do it
[50:57] or not
[50:59] three beehives or 300 amen whatever why
[51:04] it's the same thing but I want more
[51:08] fellowship I want to be able to where
[51:09] God can use me more don't you and what
[51:12] are you stepping a pulpit or not I want
[51:15] God to be able to use me I want God to
[51:17] be able to use you in the capacity that
[51:19] you're in because let's be honest he
[51:24] can't if we don't let him we can't if he
[51:29] don't if we don't let him and the reason
[51:31] we're gonna let him is he's like I'm
[51:33] fixing to tell you the Bible says
[51:36] washing of the water by the word we were
[51:40] talking last Sunday about the red heifer
[51:43] but that to me that was he it was
[51:46] outstanding
[51:47] now that Israel listen folks even under
[51:53] bulls and goats
[51:54] the water of the red heifer sanctified
[51:58] those people the washing of the water
[52:03] physical water Moses had to wash Aaron
[52:07] from the top of his head to the sole of
[52:09] his foot but God accepted that nasty old
[52:13] man you said no he was clean no he was
[52:15] even his soul was dirty but he came the
[52:20] way God told him to come and when he did
[52:24] he could walk into that Holy of Holies
[52:26] whether he was whether he was sweating
[52:29] or shaking in his shoes or remembering
[52:31] what he did two weeks ago he walked in
[52:34] and said God you said if I wash if that
[52:37] Moses washes me I put on blue I put on
[52:40] green I put on this I put on that I put
[52:42] on this that you will justify me right
[52:47] and that I am sanctified by the red
[52:51] heifer and I hope you got that like
[52:52] Sunday listen folks that red heifer is a
[52:54] female always considered talking to the
[52:58] church
[52:59] I read you and will read it again
[53:00] because we're going to go over just a
[53:01] few minutes the church house this world
[53:06] gonna be sanctified
[53:11] we know Jesus we know that Noah when the
[53:19] waters came in Noah's time brother Brian
[53:21] said that was a type of justification
[53:22] right now what did he type
[53:24] sanctification Jesus spilt his blood at
[53:27] Calvary - what cleanse and claim the
[53:31] earth your body was in here but remember
[53:35] the physical chemistry of his blood is
[53:38] lost somewhere they couldn't collect all
[53:43] of his blood
[53:44] naturally it spilled on the ground went
[53:47] under Layton you know they had to clean
[53:49] it with water so I'm sure it wouldn't
[53:50] anyway but you're saying I'm saying it
[53:51] was the life that was in that boy and
[53:54] then but he had to show that to sanctify
[54:00] but remember he left
[54:04] sowho Deeley vit -
[54:07] he left it dies you said all they look
[54:11] so bad no that's what God wanted when
[54:15] he's sanctified and cleansed and claimed
[54:17] this earth to Calvary he cleansed it for
[54:20] every person but he knew who wouldn't in
[54:23] you who wouldn't and I'll promise you he
[54:31] was looking down through time
[54:33] he's got almighty in human flesh he was
[54:37] looking down through time and he said
[54:38] there's gonna come a day where they're
[54:41] gonna really realize what happened
[54:43] on this hill because they're not going
[54:46] to just be it's not just going to be
[54:48] here safe it's gonna be an absolute part
[54:52] of me walking on the face of the earth
[54:55] sanctifying this earth because when we
[55:00] get to the sixth seal ya God's gonna
[55:02] rain fire yeah God's gonna rain
[55:05] hurricanes and tornadoes and all by the
[55:09] sound of who two prophets two prophets
[55:14] hey six seals so sanctifies this earth
[55:17] what he cleans it off through two
[55:19] prophets amen so yes Christ died Christ
[55:25] did all these things amen but he left it
[55:27] to finish with a red heifer without spot
[55:32] a church oh yeah it look bad there was
[55:38] some black in here but that was pure
[55:40] white righteous people in every church
[55:42] age now we come to the end where it
[55:46] looks so bad but I promise you the bride
[55:50] in this age does not look back right all
[55:54] this other riffraff may look bad
[55:56] all this you don't get the Holy Ghost
[55:59] till you die how foolish how foolish you
[56:05] wait till then I promise you you gonna
[56:08] have a look swamp you're gonna have a
[56:11] moment like the Pope does you remember
[56:14] that guy that kills herself and he get
[56:16] 72 virgins when he you know that kills
[56:18] herself to me that's a nuts moment cuz
[56:20] within about two
[56:21] seconds after he died blows himself up
[56:22] he's gonna say oops the Pope is gonna
[56:28] say oops right why because of their
[56:32] teaching though it's what they've been
[56:33] taught but people put their life on that
[56:37] amen
[56:39] but now we've got the pure message that
[56:42] will bring back full fellowship between
[56:44] us and God
[56:46] God can't fellowship with error sure he
[56:52] waits at the ignorance of Martin Luther
[56:55] but he was pleased with that one little
[56:58] place that Martin Luther you know I was
[57:00] thinking as brother Dale was talking
[57:02] Martin Luther you know we're talking
[57:04] about this fourth Age Dark Age I mean
[57:06] pitiful sixty-eight million Christians
[57:08] were killed by Christians remember you
[57:11] know really 68 million Christians were
[57:13] killed by supposedly Christian you know
[57:16] okay so what God was doing there's the
[57:18] red there's the thing to find God is
[57:20] sanctifying that group of people to
[57:24] bring a church out of the ground unless
[57:28] the corner we'd die now look inside that
[57:31] to shoot his life amen
[57:36] there's life in there there's life in
[57:39] that roof and like my brother never and
[57:41] I like that quote the predestinated seed
[57:43] laid in the root listen the
[57:46] predestinated see the lure in those two
[57:48] shoes you couldn't see it that's why you
[57:53] you plant one apple seed every Apple
[57:57] that will ever come on that tree brother
[58:00] Larry is in that little ol bitty seed
[58:03] same way with God but you gotta plant it
[58:06] in the ground
[58:07] you gotta plant it in the ground Christ
[58:12] had to go in the ground
[58:13] why so we could come up sure he came up
[58:17] but what do you do he brought all of us
[58:19] with him
[58:23] but I like this steel but it's very
[58:27] rough to stay in a sanctified condition
[58:30] you know that we've talked about many
[58:31] many times before because the unclean
[58:34] spirit goes out of a man walks in and
[58:36] Dry places seeking rest find this nun
[58:38] it's in the scripture but what does he
[58:40] do he comes back finds it swept and
[58:44] garnished what cleaned and set aside the
[58:46] glass was cleaned and set aside for
[58:48] service but if you don't put it in
[58:50] service if you leave a hole up here he's
[58:51] gonna bring and come right back in and
[58:53] make it worse amen
[58:55] make you religious you got to go on with
[59:00] God sure Methodists that was fine the
[59:02] method of doing things the church that's
[59:05] what I was saying before you got Martin
[59:07] Luther drank beer of course it was a
[59:09] German they drink beer like we drink tea
[59:11] he drank beer and smoked the pipe talked
[59:13] about God God said no that's not all of
[59:17] it that's got to be cleaned up cuz
[59:20] that's still closed to the world thereby
[59:22] all right when they say man some of you
[59:25] that went off to the land and I'd come
[59:26] back grief so anyway you got Martin
[59:32] Luther God was satisfied with that for
[59:35] the time but he said I got this I can't
[59:38] stay in this it's not clean as I want it
[59:43] so I'm gonna bring it to John Wesley and
[59:51] John Wesley's gonna teach a sanctified
[59:54] life so God said hey that's getting
[59:58] better cuz we need to get all this junk
[1:00:00] out we got to clean the closets out get
[1:00:03] all the junk out but remember he wasn't
[1:00:06] satisfied with that now those people
[1:00:08] have the Holy Ghost but God still
[1:00:10] couldn't work that was that big crust
[1:00:11] around that where he couldn't work right
[1:00:14] so he says why the Pentecostals oh my
[1:00:17] back into the Bible gifts tongues
[1:00:20] interpretation people haven't what joy
[1:00:24] shout praise God we might want to try
[1:00:27] that sometime
[1:00:33] listen if you don't know I've been more
[1:00:35] I'm more passionate now than I ever have
[1:00:37] been you need to be passionate about God
[1:00:40] you need to be you need to be where you
[1:00:43] think man there's more there's more you
[1:00:48] know why you know there's more cause
[1:00:49] somebody standing behind a pulpit
[1:00:51] telling you there's more you can't get
[1:00:55] it sitting at home oh you'll get more
[1:00:59] all right
[1:01:00] it won't be more God it'll be more
[1:01:03] popcorn and tea and those of you that
[1:01:06] have TVs and internet and whatever and
[1:01:11] tell about nothing like that you know
[1:01:12] that but God said okay I'm back in my
[1:01:18] church okay but I'm still like brother
[1:01:22] Dale said you know the start of sardis
[1:01:24] an agent was an unfulfilled age honestly
[1:01:27] every age was an unfulfilled day they
[1:01:30] came to a place brother Brown said they
[1:01:31] come to a place couldn't get them on way
[1:01:33] out why didn't have enough work to get
[1:01:34] them out the river they didn't have a
[1:01:37] preacher listen they didn't have a
[1:01:38] prophet like brother bright of the
[1:01:42] mouthpiece of God comes remember when
[1:01:45] God speaks it's always truth I can rest
[1:01:50] you can rest your soul I can if God
[1:01:52] speaks it's the truth whether you like
[1:01:56] it or not whether I like it or not it's
[1:01:59] the truth that's why I you know they
[1:02:04] talk about brother Branham that's not in
[1:02:05] the other I hear God I hear God and like
[1:02:11] sister Johnny you didn't know that I was
[1:02:12] gonna talk about this but since Johnny
[1:02:14] come in studies and she said somebody we
[1:02:18] were talking about you know layers 1,100
[1:02:19] sermons she said do I have to read every
[1:02:21] book no you don't have to read every
[1:02:24] book I've got to read one book you know
[1:02:27] what God said then to read 1,100 not no
[1:02:30] word he said we're not looking at
[1:02:36] quantity this day and time we're looking
[1:02:38] at quality
[1:02:39] hey man so listen but read to understand
[1:02:44] right don't read for volume we'd
[1:02:47] understand no you don't have to listen
[1:02:50] that it'd be nice to listen to 1,100
[1:02:52] sermons start from 47 go all the way to
[1:02:55] 65 you would be tired when you got
[1:02:58] finish and it would take you a long time
[1:03:02] but when God speaks to you to go I said
[1:03:05] when God speaks to you to go read a book
[1:03:08] or listen to a tape then he's probably
[1:03:11] wanting to talk to you through that
[1:03:14] message I didn't say probably dinner I'm
[1:03:19] sorry he is going to talk to you through
[1:03:22] that message hey man that's the same
[1:03:25] thing with these seals we have been so
[1:03:27] caught up with the white horse rider and
[1:03:30] the red horse rider and the black horse
[1:03:33] rider and the pale horse rider and we're
[1:03:38] not looking and that's what I'm trying
[1:03:39] to bring to you I'm not looking at what
[1:03:41] God's doing every step of the way it's
[1:03:44] God doing everything not Satan it's God
[1:03:48] doing this it's God realigning mind and
[1:03:51] you're thinking because I thinking in
[1:03:54] our soul is not wrong it's our thinking
[1:03:58] in our middleman it's what's wrong
[1:04:00] you ever mentioned memory reason
[1:04:02] conscious affection imagination okay
[1:04:05] well think about I want you to sit down
[1:04:07] one day and see where your biggest
[1:04:11] trouble is if your biggest trouble if
[1:04:17] your biggest trouble is that your memory
[1:04:22] says that you did something wrong and
[1:04:24] you know all that stuff that's the last
[1:04:27] like I told her she said well the devil
[1:04:29] tells me I said when the devil's lips
[1:04:31] were moving his line even when he's
[1:04:34] telling you the truth he's lying because
[1:04:36] he's got a little slant to it hey man
[1:04:41] when we start saying everything God said
[1:04:44] about us when we start saying everything
[1:04:49] God's already said about it that's when
[1:04:51] we'll big back into full fellowship
[1:04:54] so these seals to me is insurance
[1:04:57] breaking back it's showing that that
[1:05:00] Satan had all this bound because of all
[1:05:02] this junk all these different doctrines
[1:05:06] and all these different ideas all these
[1:05:07] idols all these graven images amen
[1:05:13] that's my problem I'm Idol ID le an ID
[1:05:22] oh l will make you ideally because you
[1:05:26] you know what they do is I said ten look
[1:05:27] at that I'll be whatever it may be
[1:05:31] hey man but God's not an idol he is a
[1:05:36] man he is a moving breathing living
[1:05:41] human being I don't know if you knew
[1:05:43] that or not
[1:05:50] but these seals reveals the full plan of
[1:05:52] redemption not just for the man inside
[1:05:57] he's already redeemed listen if you're
[1:06:00] born again you can't be any more Reedy
[1:06:03] in that man than you are right now you
[1:06:08] cannot there's no way if you got the
[1:06:12] whatever elements of the ocean if you
[1:06:14] got that as a tea spoon in your soul
[1:06:16] that's gone
[1:06:21] but now the outside guy or the next guy
[1:06:25] I don't say outside this is the earth
[1:06:26] that middle guy is the one we got to
[1:06:28] work with those remember sanctification
[1:06:32] under the seals is not cleaning your
[1:06:34] soul you suppose already clean that's
[1:06:39] why I'm thinking it's why brother Dale
[1:06:40] brings it so long and I read it too
[1:06:43] there's mr. Malachi 4 do two things amen
[1:06:49] restore the heart of the babbling
[1:06:54] Pentecostal babies back to the original
[1:06:58] faith of the Father and then where God
[1:07:01] can work like he never worked before
[1:07:05] they said back then
[1:07:08] but that wasn't it in his total he's to
[1:07:14] do two things the second thing is to
[1:07:19] literally turn us back you know what
[1:07:21] literally is I've reached this before
[1:07:22] literally is not an idol it's not
[1:07:25] figuratively it's not assuming literally
[1:07:29] this is listen I'm not a type of me you
[1:07:33] literally see me standing here all right
[1:07:35] so that's what brother Branham was here
[1:07:37] to do he wasn't here he was here to
[1:07:39] literally turn us back like I said
[1:07:42] before he will that bridge he reached in
[1:07:45] the warm of our mind yes we were going
[1:07:49] in the wrong direction he reached in a
[1:07:52] room of our mind and he turned us around
[1:07:54] so that we could have a birth that was
[1:07:58] correct by Malachi 4 amen so the head
[1:08:03] could comfort not be a breech birth
[1:08:07] they've had breech birth all down
[1:08:09] through here but literally turn us back
[1:08:12] man ah me brother he's gonna literally
[1:08:15] reach in your mind and change the way
[1:08:17] you think everybody but you can go hold
[1:08:28] on I don't want you in there yeah you
[1:08:30] say yeah yes you can yes you can you can
[1:08:34] say that's too rich for my blood
[1:08:36] we've been saying it for a while because
[1:08:38] we still here
[1:08:39] somebody has me but when we come to
[1:08:46] these seals though we see that rider he
[1:08:48] rides off well let's think about this
[1:08:50] other day when that wild horse rider
[1:08:51] rides off Donny
[1:08:53] who's left yeah who's left if you're
[1:08:59] already born again and this is you these
[1:09:04] people already live these ages folks so
[1:09:07] we're not talking about them people in
[1:09:08] the ages we're talking by today
[1:09:11] right now so if that white horse rider
[1:09:15] has rode away from you who's left God
[1:09:21] Almighty and he won't just standing
[1:09:25] there at the door waiting for you to say
[1:09:27] come on come on
[1:09:31] teach me something today Lord teach me
[1:09:34] something teach me because he told him
[1:09:46] and every one of these ages right but
[1:09:49] look there was a stopping point hey man
[1:09:55] there was a stopping point then another
[1:09:58] age came with another message but we
[1:10:02] don't get over here to number seven
[1:10:04] there's nothing left brother brown said
[1:10:08] we're either going down or up hey man
[1:10:12] we're going down and we're going up I
[1:10:15] don't think of I'm not even ready to
[1:10:18] quote we all right but to me this is the
[1:10:24] sanctification under this seal like I
[1:10:27] said justification we preach 10 or 11
[1:10:29] sermons and that's gonna be a bunch this
[1:10:31] one maybe just one more now think this
[1:10:33] one was gonna be it but they made us do
[1:10:34] one more but sanctification has
[1:10:37] something for you to do you can't
[1:10:40] justify yourself brother Bramson you
[1:10:42] can't pull yourself up by your boot
[1:10:43] strap in a walk wait a minute now you
[1:10:47] say put that in the message faith in
[1:10:52] what what you did no faith in what God
[1:10:56] did for you that bursts you to me when
[1:10:59] you understand that God Almighty died so
[1:11:03] that he could kill you and come back and
[1:11:06] live inside of you
[1:11:11] you have to have faith but once you have
[1:11:15] faith
[1:11:17] once you have faith I mean how many ever
[1:11:21] saw Jesus down the cross who's Paul
[1:11:26] who's Peter who's James he's gone I
[1:11:30] don't know these people have you ever
[1:11:32] seen them no but I see the manifestation
[1:11:36] of God through them and then the
[1:11:41] manifestation of the man called Jesus
[1:11:43] because Peter and Paul can't get in you
[1:11:47] but that man can that man through the
[1:11:50] new birth that's why I see birth it's a
[1:11:53] birth if something new sister Trudy
[1:11:57] didn't have Chloe three times she had
[1:12:00] her once why it was a birth right amen
[1:12:08] but remember once you start here though
[1:12:11] this was my point for the day then being
[1:12:15] born again being born again where that
[1:12:23] memory that used to bother us
[1:12:25] don't bother snow more that reasoning
[1:12:29] that we used to reason with this
[1:12:31] don't bother some more oh my and you
[1:12:36] know what then that to me that makes me
[1:12:38] satisfied then I'm in the right age at
[1:12:41] the right time at the right place
[1:12:44] doesn't have to be Lula Georgia I'm
[1:12:47] talking at the right place in God the
[1:12:49] man the right place in God and now God
[1:12:52] you know what because what you do is
[1:12:53] it's when you do what God said he's got
[1:12:58] to do what he said he's got to do what
[1:13:01] he said
[1:13:02] it doesn't matter he's got to do what he
[1:13:05] said even if there's a prostitute that
[1:13:08] walks up in the prayer line filthy
[1:13:12] laughs but she had faith in what that
[1:13:16] little man said she said whatever he
[1:13:19] said that's what I'm gonna do and boots
[1:13:22] you get her his wife cuz her memory
[1:13:23] reason
[1:13:24] conservation imagination waiting well
[1:13:27] she knew she was a sinner but a
[1:13:29] Christian would walk up and now
[1:13:30] guarantee this is what happened brother
[1:13:32] Brown baby and he'll say you're nervous
[1:13:34] well yeah you're nervous you're standing
[1:13:37] before somebody's face to tell you what
[1:13:38] you did yesterday right so then your
[1:13:42] memory goes to work in your reasoning
[1:13:44] conservation imagination and you lose
[1:13:46] your healing because you don't have
[1:13:47] faith in what that man said you're
[1:13:49] trying to have faith in what you're
[1:13:50] trying to work up I'm sorry but let me
[1:13:57] be like the prostitute she got something
[1:14:00] hey man I once was I was a prostitute in

[1:15:36] speaking to a group of people the watch
[1:15:41] no you're not that the unrighteous shall
[1:15:43] not inherit the kingdom of God
[1:15:45] be not deceived neither fornicators nor
[1:15:48] idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate

[1:16:18] such were some of you well you think
[1:16:24] we're tough that was in Paul's
[1:16:26] congregation at one time and such were
[1:16:30] some of you but you're washed but you
[1:16:34] were sanctified now but you are
[1:16:37] justified in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:16:39] and by the spirit of our God now that's
[1:16:42] the inside man now let's bring it out to
[1:16:45] the outside man now we know for a fact
[1:16:47] you better not be any of these in the
[1:16:49] natural form but we can be idolaters in
[1:16:53] our spirit amen
[1:16:59] thieves yes covetous yes drunkards yes
[1:17:05] drunk on the things of the world and on
[1:17:07] the things of God you understand so
[1:17:10] let's bring this up I I'm like brother
[1:17:13] Dale you have to watch what if you'll
[1:17:15] watch what brother Branham says he is
[1:17:18] talking in layers so it's Paul they're
[1:17:22] talking in layers you said he's all
[1:17:24] about talking in layers he's talking to
[1:17:26] one group of people this way another
[1:17:30] group just like the woman the two women
[1:17:31] walked out and she said he called me a
[1:17:33] buzzard the whole service and the other
[1:17:35] sisters said well he called me an eagle
[1:17:37] the whole service they heard the same
[1:17:39] thing they heard the same service
[1:17:42] but what that lady over here did is she
[1:17:45] didn't have the Holy Ghost she wasn't
[1:17:46] listening but she heard him say
[1:17:48] something that she didn't like but this
[1:17:51] sister over here was maybe in a little
[1:17:53] position that she could take what he
[1:17:55] said and she so he called me an eagle
[1:17:58] that's the same way with you and I my
[1:17:59] brother Browns preaching a message he's
[1:18:01] preaching to people in the congregation
[1:18:03] and people in the future
[1:18:06] you remember that because we weren't
[1:18:08] sitting there but we are recipients of
[1:18:10] what was saying amen
[1:18:12] so we were there in the form of the word
[1:18:19] that alright we were there in the form
[1:18:23] of the word I just got that at least
[1:18:24] thank you that's good all right let's go
[1:18:27] the next and first Thessalonians 4 1
[1:18:30] through 4 furthermore that we beseech
[1:18:33] you brethren in his or see by the Lord
[1:18:34] Jesus that you have received of us how
[1:18:37] you ought to walk look he's preaching
[1:18:39] and to please God so you would abound
[1:18:42] more and more does that not mean grow
[1:18:48] get more and more of God Paul I'm
[1:18:52] talking to you Thessalonians you've got
[1:18:54] something but now you're gonna get more
[1:18:56] and more for ye know what Commandments
[1:19:00] we gave you by the Lord Jesus for this
[1:19:04] is you won't know what will of God is we
[1:19:05] know what the other one is for this is
[1:19:07] the will of God even your sanctification
[1:19:11] wait a minute that ye should abstain
[1:19:15] from fornication that every one of you
[1:19:18] should know how to possess this is
[1:19:21] something you got to do you can't
[1:19:24] justify yourself but you sure can't
[1:19:27] sanctify right at what he said and
[1:19:30] that's what he said
[1:19:31] then every one of you should know how to
[1:19:35] possess his vessel in sanctification and
[1:19:38] honor is that all right how you gonna do
[1:19:45] that
[1:19:45] 1st Timothy 4 tells you exactly for
[1:19:50] every creature of God is good nothing to
[1:19:52] be refused if it be received with
[1:19:53] Thanksgiving for it is sanctified
[1:19:55] by the Word of God and prayer you shall
[1:19:59] ask for food well--that's for everything
[1:20:04] sanctify my vessel now I tell you a
[1:20:08] little story about that we were listen
[1:20:11] when you pray over your food to bless
[1:20:13] your food
[1:20:14] do you really let's be honest don't show
[1:20:19] you him how many of you really through
[1:20:21] your mind thank God if they something
[1:20:23] wrong with that food you change it
[1:20:26] [Music]
[1:20:27] called I'll promise you you say Lord
[1:20:29] bless this food snakes find a nurse for
[1:20:31] our bodies amen you ain't thinking about
[1:20:33] that but I'll tell you what happened in
[1:20:35] my experience when I got first when I
[1:20:37] got born again back in 98 99 me and two
[1:20:42] of the other co work or two of the
[1:20:44] co-owners went with me to a restaurant
[1:20:47] and we ordered the same identical thing
[1:20:51] see how this works we order the same
[1:20:54] thing State and gravy green beans and
[1:20:57] okra same thing I said two blessing over
[1:21:02] my food they just went right on the
[1:21:04] eating course they were you know they
[1:21:05] weren't nothing but they just went
[1:21:07] around eating got a phone call six
[1:21:10] o'clock the next morning bob says are
[1:21:13] you okay I see I'm fine
[1:21:16] he said I've had state said I've been
[1:21:19] throwing up and had diarrhea since three
[1:21:22] o'clock this morning
[1:21:24] ten minutes later Barry calls they said
[1:21:28] you okay I just talked to Bob he's
[1:21:30] having the same problem I'm having
[1:21:32] throwing up diarrhea I said nope I have
[1:21:35] no problem
[1:21:37] [Applause]
[1:21:39] go change that food he changed what was
[1:21:44] in it
[1:21:51] he changed what was in it and made it
[1:21:56] honorable for me to eat and every time
[1:22:00] we went to eat afterwards they would
[1:22:02] stop and they'd say what you blip says
[1:22:05] would you bless this food so when we
[1:22:10] pray you pray that you don't know folks
[1:22:13] I won't get a restaurant you would
[1:22:17] listen you sent something back don't
[1:22:21] ever send something back they'll spit in
[1:22:24] your food they'll push I'm telling you
[1:22:26] this world is not my home but I know
[1:22:31] what these people think cuz I was part
[1:22:35] of their thinker at one time oh they
[1:22:37] used to order fillet a fish at
[1:22:39] McDonald's and I'm not gonna tell you
[1:22:40] what they put in there well it was
[1:22:41] horrible but don't but you know what if
[1:22:44] I pray and I don't know that but if I
[1:22:46] pray God will change that food if he'll
[1:22:49] change food why won't he change you and
[1:22:51] I why by the Word of God in prayer I
[1:22:54] knew to pray over my food I didn't know
[1:22:56] there's anything wrong with that steak
[1:22:58] but there was because two people
[1:23:01] testified anything right amen and they
[1:23:04] were out for the whole day and part of
[1:23:06] the next day I think they just humble I
[1:23:07] mean it was a it was a foodborne illness
[1:23:11] and it was strange we never ordered the
[1:23:13] same thing we ordered the same I did you
[1:23:16] know if I'd order chicken and they'd
[1:23:17] order steak they said well it was our
[1:23:19] state we all ordered the same identical
[1:23:21] play because we were all going to the
[1:23:23] language the man that looks good yeah
[1:23:24] that's good we'll have three of them so
[1:23:27] you know God did that yeah to testify so
[1:23:30] when you say a prayer over your food but
[1:23:34] that same prayer that you pray over your
[1:23:36] food you pray for God to sanctify you
[1:23:41] second Timothy 2:20 verse 22 but in a
[1:23:43] great house there are not only vessels
[1:23:45] of gold and of silver blocks of wood and
[1:23:47] of Earth and some of honor and some
[1:23:49] dishonor if a man therefore purge
[1:23:53] himself from these he shall be a vessel
[1:23:57] unto honor sanctified and meat for the
[1:24:01] Masters use and prepared unto every good
[1:24:05] work 1st Corinthians 15 31 I protest by
[1:24:09] your rejoicing which I have in Christ
[1:24:11] our Lord I die daily daily
[1:24:16] sanctification Co based memories that I
[1:24:20] won't die I want to die right
[1:24:22] don't you have memories you want to die
[1:24:25] please people we should be hey man we
[1:24:30] got met but look take that thing and say
[1:24:32] look Satan God's already put that in a
[1:24:35] sea of God forgiveness that's why I'm
[1:24:37] telling you as this as this foundation
[1:24:41] of justification if you look back to
[1:24:43] where those he is justified is already
[1:24:45] to look like you look back to that
[1:24:46] justification if you put in God's ear
[1:24:50] forget if he put it in his sea of
[1:24:52] forgetfulness never to be remembered
[1:24:54] again he can't put it in your memory
[1:24:57] so who does Satan all the time that's
[1:25:05] right but you know what it ought to be
[1:25:07] just a record just it's just going to
[1:25:09] turn over and you know you know how
[1:25:11] sometimes you turn on music you never
[1:25:12] listen to it you just need it for
[1:25:14] background noise just you Satan for
[1:25:16] background noise seeing you seeing you
[1:25:20] have purified your souls and obeying the
[1:25:22] truth through the spirit but they'll
[1:25:24] read this other thing unto unfeigned
[1:25:26] love of the Brethren see that you love
[1:25:28] one another with a pure heart fervently
[1:25:30] being born again not of corruptible seed
[1:25:34] but of incorruptible by what by the Word
[1:25:37] of God which liveth into by the forever
[1:25:40] now keep reading for all flesh is grass
[1:25:44] okay and all the glory of man is the
[1:25:47] flower of grass the grass withereth
[1:25:50] we're withering we're withering
[1:25:54] some of us are withered some of us are
[1:25:57] withering the kids are going what's he
[1:25:59] talking about the grass withereth and
[1:26:03] the flower thereof falleth away look but
[1:26:06] the word of the Lord endureth forever
[1:26:10] and this is the word which by the gospel
[1:26:12] is preached unto you let's stand our
[1:26:16] feet I'll start back over again if ice
[1:26:21] alright a couple of Sunday's the
[1:26:23] sanctification to me is a wonderful
[1:26:26] thing because you do and listen I'm just
[1:26:31] going to tell you the way I see it I
[1:26:35] know there's nothing you can do to be
[1:26:37] safe it's not by works lest any man
[1:26:40] should boast but you know what he that
[1:26:46] overcometh it feels good to overcome
[1:26:50] something hey man honestly in my
[1:26:53] humanity I feel good I felt good when I
[1:26:57] didn't have to scoop stick that stupid
[1:27:00] tobacco in my mouth and I wanted it bad
[1:27:07] till the day God saved my soul and I
[1:27:09] didn't want it no more I keep telling
[1:27:13] the guy that works down there Willis
[1:27:15] it's a post office I said Danny every
[1:27:17] time you put their stuff in your mouth
[1:27:18] you gotta spit quit putting your mouth
[1:27:21] but you know what it's a desire God put
[1:27:25] it a desire there and Satan filled it
[1:27:28] but if you take that desire and put God
[1:27:32] there that stuff will go away that's
[1:27:35] right but remember one thing folks
[1:27:37] sanctify your house sanctify your car
[1:27:41] God will actually change and you know
[1:27:44] what I just got this more shared with
[1:27:48] you that's the same thing he's gonna do
[1:27:50] with this guy if he changed the atoms in
[1:27:55] that piece of meat from being rotten
[1:28:02] to be appear enough to eat
[1:28:04] that's what's gonna change your body and
[1:28:08] it's just believing what God's already
[1:28:11] said it's not something strange we we
[1:28:14] there's no strange doctrine
[1:28:19] sanctification a red horse rider sure he
[1:28:24] rode through and he killed people
[1:28:25] literally killed sixty-eight million
[1:28:28] Christian people for what they believe
[1:28:31] in brother Bram said untold billions by
[1:28:34] his doctrine but that had to happen for
[1:28:38] that to go down and to start back up and
[1:28:42] now it's not going to go back down again
