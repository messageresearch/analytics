mean you saw a preacher those humble you need we got to do it cancer by yourself are you trying to hold the right attitude but let me tell you why attitude is so important the brother God used a quotation to remember this message was he says no matter how much i pray and lay day and night studying and praying before the lord walked down here maybe the anointing is on me and walk up her and i feel resentment attitude husband wife got in fight before church because she probably took all the time he ready to go she said how look i don't care how you look let's go see he's he's he's just it just grieved him away resentment in the service resentment would stop the move of the Spirit you know people don't know is so that's what we got to come with an attitude lord I want you to speak to me tonight let my attitude be right cuz I've got a need that I need to be answered the Lord but if resentment is in a service might not even I are you my header right out but somebody coming to church with a bad attitude I don't want to be you need to go back outside so Lord take this from me you know it's easier to it's easier to get it and it work as a human being it's easier to be that way it's easy to get attitude but as we give up over to God heal helpless in the words in the words you know anyway I don't want to be a double minded man the butter so double minded man is unstable and that
