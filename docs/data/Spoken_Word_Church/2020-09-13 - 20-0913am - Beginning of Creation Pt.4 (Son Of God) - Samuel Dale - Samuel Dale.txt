read this morning from 120 i'm 139 psalms 1 through 24. i read this the other day this lord put me on it after wade got through speaking the other night i was very touched with what he said and i think it's time for all of us to really step back and we need to look in the mirror and check ourselves out i know i do i can't speak for y'all but my greatest joy is being able to pray for you amen and just being able to speak to the lord about it and i know i have an angel that takes that prayer up there and gets it right because i know i'll get it wrong but he'll get it right and that's what we have to put our faith in and we have to hang on and our faith has really got to grow and it only grows one way is by the taking of the word amen hearing it reading it and becoming a word before we go to the author this morning we'll just say a little word of prayer all right very precious father we thank you for this day you've given us to come and gather around your word once again and to hear your beautiful word lord the very fiber of our lives that hold us together and bonds us father god to you lord without knowing your word where would i be i'd be wandering in the fields lord thank you for bringing me into the fold i love you lord jesus for all the things you've done especially the things you didn't do i asked because father correction is a good thing and we asked lord today that you just correct us with your word and bless those that couldn't make it through the door today and they're henderson's father and i ask you just touch and bless that little bride and strengthen her faith father just bring her to the top of the lid following this filler and we asked father today that each one here is a blessed person being here to come and hear the word today and bless brother

down and art acquainted with all my ways thou has beset me behind and before and laid that hand upon me whether shall i go from the spirit or whether shall i flee from thy presence i take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea i say surely the darkness shall cover me even the night shall be light upon me but the night shineth as the day the darkness and the light are both the light to thee for thou hast possessed my reigns thou has covered me in my mother's womb my substance was not hid from thee when i was made into secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth how precious are all thy thoughts unto me oh god now great is this some of them surely that will slay the wicked o god depart from me therefore ye bled him do not i hate them o lord

everybody in the house of the lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures during what we've been reading revelations 3 14 and then we'll go to matthew 6 matthew 13 uh 16. or 16 13. i'll get it right a minute but anyhow just remember all that are sick among us the different ones all across the country different brothers that are they're getting the report in now that there's many many sicknesses and one church they had like 40 people in the church there that uh had the virus so just you know it's it's a bad time and a bad bad point but it's it's we're supposed to be we're right where we're supposed to be we're right everything's right on time and all but you know it'll work out god will work it out and everything all right just remember that brother uh luis the lord willing to be preaching for us wednesday so remember that keep him in mind and we're going to have the communion now this afternoon so we're planning on doing some way to let you march down and somebody'll be downstairs for you can walk out under the canopy in the communion and just give it to you there instead of trying to divide it up between all the others and just do that as we go down so we'll we'll uh guides you as to what to do and what we're doing because we want to we want to take communion that's that's the way it is just pray one for another keep praying for my wife and hold her up that the lord would bless revelation 3 14. thank you father for your loving your grace unto us thank you for everything and we just ask you that you'd be with us and guide us and lord that most of all you'd forgive us of our many failures and keep us under the blood because that's where we're we want to be in all things and lord just have your way now as we talk about you today you come on the scene and manifest yourself in each one of us and let your loving grace be with us and lord let all of our thoughts and ideas and all be passed away from ourselves and let them be what you want us to think what you want us to do just have your way now bless the sick around the country remember the little bride you promised it and we believe it the father we just committed all to you now in jesus name amen revelations 3 14 this is to this age and the time so and unto the angel of the church of the ladies write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god all right let's go to matthew we'll start reading in verse 13. when jesus came into the coast of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that i the son of man am and they said some say thou art john the baptist some elias and others jeremiah's are one of the prophets he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am and simon's peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou has not revealed this revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was jesus the christ amen you may be seated the lord had blessing to the reading of the word in summing up all of his uh things about the church and how she's built on the revelation of jesus christ then he ends up telling them says now don't don't tell nobody about the christ uh you know because he knew they would understand that's been the most mysterious part of all is how that god could be made manifest upon the earth in the way that he has and to be able to show himself reveal himself make himself known and starting with that with the christ or last sunday we spent our time trying to speak about the christ and we went through a lot of the scriptures and things you know that thou art the christ the son of the living god and that was who he jesus was declaring himself to be while he was here upon the earth was that christ in you know in doing that then that would be a great mystery in the understanding of the godhead all right what have we been doing on the point are the beginning of creation as we've been back and forth back and forth and we'll keep doing it to make sure you follow the thought pattern that i'm trying to lay down to you and remember what we were dealing with that god's first creation was himself not that he created himself now that's see that's our point of our thinking and we think well god just created himself or god created another person or another doing and and i've been over that and over that with you enough to where you know now that what i'm talking about at the beginning is that when god came down and just stepped over into another form another manifestation another uh point but not another being not another personality or something you know not not making more persons out of it but making it to be the point that that it was god himself moving over into another form and see that way that that does away with what we think about beginning because we look at beginning and then we think well then if you're looking at beginning like this stop and start and etc then your mind will go back to the point that you're uh you'll try to figure out where god is and what he's doing when the best thing to do is just think about what he's saying that's right he just stepped down in another form he just moved into another form he just became into not another being not another person the same god just move into another form well see that way then the godhead will become clearer as we go along to understand you know and then we can get into i'm a father i'm a son i'm a human and i'm you know and all like that as the prophet would be doing it to express the the godhead and and give a great understanding unto us all right but in doing that see he's the beginning of the creation not that they was that he had to create we think create means to take something and make it create you know but not in god it's just uh he doesn't he he can go and the world can come into existence he can he can do anything it's not in that form it's in the form of showing what he's doing for the time and he's always revealed himself and that's why that we kept on emphasizing emphasizing that uh the the father came to uh into being but the way he did was because that he stepped into another form called a son and see we look and i said i keep emphasizing this one to where you can think about it when you think of son of god you'll think about two thousand years ago i mean that's where your mind locks into two thousand years ago son of god when that's not it see the son of god was the first uh creation to come into being or god stepping into another form and he simply just moved from being father no to coming down to being the logos the theophany the word the son of god amen and that can be back before the world never begun see we want to bring it down and put it in a 2000 year bracket to word that we can kind of try to comprehend but we can't do that we got to leave it in the basis of of the understanding of to that point all right and see then as we were bringing those out let's let's get a couple of these and just let's read over this i i know that you you don't like for me to keep reading the same thing but i like to read so go ahead with number one and uh let's just take this part and uh get to that that we can see uh okay now if god created man in his own image and his own likeness what kind of a man did he create a spirit man now if you'll notice after he had made all the creatures creation and created a spirit man the close reading and all i wanted to ask the question god given dominion of the cattle and the fishes and everything to the man all right now naturally that was dire when he made man he naturally gave him the dominion of the animals and the thing but the main way that he gave it to him was through the spiritual creation not the natural it wouldn't the natural man stand out there with a wheel get over there get over there you know no it it was the spirit man that controlled them by love by like the baptism of the holy ghost as he said here all right see the own image to the cattle lead the beasts of the field just like the holy spirit leads the believer today he was in other words adam the first man in the lower creations of god now what in the lower creations of god all right in other words he was the first man earthly speaking see we're going to try to tie two things together today from the spirit man to the natural man all right so then that'll that'll do it we're going from genesis 1 to genesis 2 and try to get that in point but look so in other words adam the first man in the lower creations in other words the animals he's explaining the animals and the things that have happened now he's explaining what that adam comes into being that he's the the the first man in the lower or the first of that being now we've got to take two things today and then we'll bring it into the third stage because naturally adam was made physically right all right then but he was made spiritually before then then he was made naturally all right and that'll tie it all together see the first creation was god himself then out of god came the logos which was the son of god all right see god just stepped over in another form like we were talking about we have to kind of do it in a reverse order we were talking about it with brother ray there you know that here he goes through these stages and he comes to a stage that he was a father then he comes to a stage that he's a grandfather all right that doesn't change him it doesn't make any difference in that it's the it's what you're talking about forgive me for coughing all right which was the son of god then out of the logos which was the word so now out of what now the son of god is the word in the beginning was the word and the word with god and the word was the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us out of the logos came forth the man all right the creator he's emphasizing how that man comes into being how did man come into being see jesus we'll get to it in just a minute he's the only begotten all right but adam was the first creation god so you got to keep that straight he was adam was the first creation first one created first human being created made as he was made and we call him in genesis 2 that he's the the flesh man all right right and see then when it comes forth it comes forth into showing that he's expressing what it is so then we go on let's go on to number two i want to get these like these first three and keep repeating these where we can can stay on it all right now no man has seen the father at any time no man can see god in the bodily form form because god is not in bodily form all right now whatever you you've got to keep one thing in mind listen no man has seen god at any time all right seen him seeing god in the bodily form because see it was two thousand years ago when the bodily form came into being now melchizedek yes but melchizedek was one thing he was a man being and all but he couldn't die for our sins see it had to be the the special one we'll get to that uh maybe next week because we're going to get to the point of seeing that he was the first of this new race all right he's the beginning of the creation of god he's the first of a new race all right adam was the beginning of the natural creation of mankind right adam was created wasn't just born like the uh or you know he was created whereas jesus had to be born because if he created adam adam couldn't die for our sins because it was a creator or a creation but see jesus christ was god almighty who stepped into another form he just moved from one form to another i hope you keep looking at that and thinking it in your mind to keep that form in mind and you'll see it see no man can see god in the bodily form because god is not in bodily form now it doesn't mean that he didn't look like us get all that so you try to figure that out well what did he look like well i guess he was a glob what was that one uh kid somebody helped me one of the kids the guy with the brain you remember and he was standing out there and they had the big old belly and the cartoon things and that big old belly and here was the brain you know and one of the cartoon characters see but see it's not that away you got to get your mind into the line of what your thinking is in what he's doing all right adam was the first of the natural creation of mankind all right because he was the first of that type of being so he came that way even before jesus came okay but it doesn't see don't try to put and figure out well what did god look like i don't understand what he looked like did he have well if he made man in the spiritual we know what that looks like right and he made the animals he made adam in the line of the animals all right we know what that looks like right see then we don't have to worry about what he's trying to figure out what did god look like back there well i guess he had to well did he have four toes and and three eyes and see no what do we look like see when he brought it down he brought down the creation and he started creating naturally that's what i've been trying to do with he created the spiritual sense coming down then he creates adam in a spiritual sense so theophany all right then he puts him into human flesh all right that's the first of that race all right you know where i'm headed because you know in the church age book where he said this is a new race that's right but that's going to be where we come down to where we're at all right we'll get to that later see all right what did he say he said god's not in a bodily form god is a spirit all right now there's the point see no man has seen the father but the only begotten of the father had declared him all right god is a spirit but remember he's not just a spirit floating around just there's something floating around no form to it no the prophet said he's a being amen he would be more real than we would be you could think how real adam would come out to be then think of a god that could create that and you think about what your body is you realize there's things in your body that it's just minut little things but yet your body is run by that things are done by those uh things going backwards and forth and you just think of all the things and you see even like the prophet said you can take the the uh certain things out of the the animal race put it into the human race it'll go right straight to that part like it's made from all right because the animals the prophet said what he was the first creation was what he was an animal but that animal was a man all right he was the first of a new race god came over from being self-existing and all that and then he steps over into another form and begins to create but his first part he steps into has to be the word so he steps into the word form and begins to create all right see then that would put the son of god the creator and that's why that they they the scripture would say and we emphasize it thou art the christ the son of the living god in other words you are god made manifest in flesh that's why they try they killed him they killed him because he was god made flesh all right because that's what he was just saying see the heart the christ the son of the living god okay all right then in doing that then he comes forth and you see what it comes to that he tries to together this natural man and and coming i mean coming from a spiritual condition to a natural man all right and makes a new race all right then jesus didn't come with four legs and two arms and a head messed up no no how did he come like us well evidently that's what god was back there right evidently god looked like this maybe he didn't look as fat as some of us or you know different things but he still looked like us all right but what was the form what was he made out of well what are we worried about what are you concerned with what he was made out of the point is he got here and that's my point it wasn't then he didn't send a son he came himself he just stepped over in another form and there's the word then he began to say let there be all right and he created the animals and created all of the things then he comes down and he creates the the flesh man in adam all right and when he does he comes forth and you can see what god has got in his mind a human being now the trick to catch is what we're going to get over to where a new creation you're going to have to wind up and come with one more creation now i know the quote so don't worry about it brother said he was he was a finished physical creation that's right he come down and he stopped creating but you know what on the day of pentecost he started creating again a new race didn't change the man don't change us out the new birth don't make you any different it just makes you to be what you should have been to start with you say should have been yeah we should have been that way we should have come that away adam was the beginning of that all right you know how i've always preached it whatever happened in adam they could have come together and god brought all of us into being and we'd all went to the tree of life and our bodies would have been made turn eternal because the soul would have been eternal coming from god all right see then that way we can we can see that god had in his mind all the way back what he was going to do but we'll see how that he does it in stages to bring it down all right then he's bringing it but then there's a great supernatural being jehovah god who covered all space and all pro what here he was in this form he steps over in another form which is the word you say yeah but he's he's not oh come on then brother and i'll take you back with that he said uh you say but he never come in flesh before he said well yes he did he said he come in flesh in melchizedek they come in flesh in that melchizedek theophany formed to moses that could see him all right see then you see what he was planning on doing what do you think god would look like i think that's what he'd look like i believe i'm as serious as i can be he's seen the back part of a man he wasn't able to see the front part right because no man could see god and live so he wasn't able to do that he had to wait until that come into flesh all right but when that would come into flesh what are you gonna make it look like did he come out to me and looking like some kind of a weird creature no they come into being what we're doing come on i'm just trying to make a natural point for you to keep it in mind to where when the spiritual comes into being that we get over to that that you'll see what we're trying to say all right then what happens the natural has got to become from it'll become from spiritual creation to natural creation all right so then get that point now look go ahead number three now no one has seen god and now the next thing we begin to see by eyes of supernatural looking we see a little white lie forming out there what is that that was called by bible readers logos or anointed or the anointing or as i was as i was going to say that the part of god began to develop into something or something so human beings could have some type of an idea what it wasn't see it was a little uh a little light moving and that that was the word of god now watch him now god gave himself birth to this son which was before there was even an atom no so when did the son of god come into being are you reading before there was even an atom before there was anything the son of god was already into being. no no that was 2 000 years ago when see that's where your mind is locked on that thought and it won't won't work see you've got to get it in the right line all right so you get him to what is the son of god god in another form what did he do he just stepped into another form now in listen if you caught that little point i laid down a there a while ago melchizedek ate the calf moses saw the back part of a man so what would god look like what was the form or looking that you're trying to look at what god is you know what was he he was a man but theophany was a man all right see you say well well i don't know theophany is all right that theology ties into a greater being as we get on down to the new birth but the point of what i'm getting at moses saw a man so what did god look like before he came over to where we're at look like a man melchizedek was a man all right so then that way we can see that that it wouldn't be something different but it's a different race in other words back before this world they would have been god self-existing on it but then when he would start coming this away he would start unveiling himself for what he would look like and what he would be and how he would would manifest himself in and all right okay see then think about it god is wait let's let's just read this one go ahead and number well i'm on the backside go ahead with number three did we done we redid that one he gave himself birth which was before there was even us adam or anything he gave himself birth to this son now when we read it over here in a minute get your mind clearer because what we're going to read is is we're brought around and says adam was god's first created son he said but jesus was his first begotten son and he was begotten through the wound of a woman see adam wasn't begotten like that adam was created straight from god's speech the word created him all right see this if you get these things straight you'll see how things fit together i was sitting there there there wednesday night when wade was bringing that out i thought come on come on come on come on come on you know oh okay what you see who was michael it was michael you say well god's first creation was angels all right then he'll turn in another lineup of bringing it down that god's first creation was this way or that way just think about it who was michael michael wasn't an angel he was an archangel the highest form that's why brother brown says michael was christ now who's christ god in another form remember that from last week god in another form you remember what he was bringing out about michael see michael was god in another form that's where satan could never figure that out because how did that guy get next to him when he first was created he knew he was created for a purpose to be god's right-hand man right but then when it all becomes to get into view and satan begin to play around a little bit michael just steps on the scene michael's not just an michael was god in another form called the christ keep that in your mind and your thinking about it and it'll keep a wonderful story because you'll see then here was god he steps over here in another form now listen which is the word right and then that word begins to say let there be what word michael that's where satan got all upset he couldn't understand i'm supposed to be his right-hand man i'm supposed to be there well what would be the right-hand man of god well now he he picked out this special angel he seemed down through there all up and he looked over and he seen michael and he goes puts them here no michael was god in another form that's why it winds up starts in michael not mentioned much back that way but michael drove here in the book of revelations when it all ends up because he fights with satan all right but just keep that little thing see you'll see what we're hitting things and i back away just a little bit when i see him moving or these brothers moving into it because i want them to minister i don't want them to just be repeaters that's fine that's great i want them to preach in their manner or their style of their doing because if you don't then they'll wind up trying to be copycats and that don't work okay just just forgive me all right go ahead to number number four okay show us the father and there he come out there was nothing and then here come the logos that looked like a halo hanging under no man has seen god at any time now eye to eye and here's the logos look like a supernatural being it's a halo that's the son of god now look he said i don't believe in eternal sonship all right but you know that brother brown and believed in eternal godship amen i got to quote here in a minute i'll read it to you you can have an eternal godhead because you can't have an eternal sonship because sons have beginnings but see jesus never had a beginning like we he was the first of a new race we'll get back to that okay go ahead go ahead to number number five let's get these because i want you to get the point now what we're talking about but now in the beginning of jesus's ministry he's such a great person that never know was ever on the earth like him and there never will be anyone like him he was he was the only begotten son of god son of almighty god we are sons by adoption through him but he is god's only begotten son now begotten son adam was god's son do you believe that but he was god's creative son jesus was not god's create native son adam was god's creative son jesus was god's begotten see god begotten his son okay go ahead go to number six let's get these fires now i'll go up to the point so how many knows that god is like then when god became the flesh and dwell in the body that he created which was his only begotten son adam was his son a creative son but jesus was his begotten son and god was in jesus reconciling the world to himself now keep in mind god you know keep in mind what we was reading a minute ago his first creative son he gave birth you remember he gave birth what was it you remember that a minute ago where he said he gave birth to his son what's giving birth to adam was created made created jesus wasn't made he was begotten he had to come into a human body to be able to be a savior adam could not fulfill that he could not be our savior but jesus christ could be our savior but he would have to come first to prove what he's doing he would have to come as a spiritual being so that would be god's first creation would be a spiritual being him stepping over in another form called the word logos theophany all right and see from there then you see coming into view michael's stepping on the scene because michael was christ not christ of the anointing he was the christ thou art the christ the son of the living god who was michael he was jesus christ before he became jesus christ that's right arne with me he was jesus christ almighty god come on we're getting onto something on the god head now let's go ahead and roll it up now he jesus the son of god had the spirit without measure is that right but we have it by measure see he had it the jesus son of god had the spirit without me that was the fullness of the godhead bodily come into human flesh sure i've explained it to you when he was a baby he couldn't die for our sins when he was 13 years old he couldn't pay the price for our sins no huh no he couldn't do that so he had to wait to a time till he become 29 going under 30 to be able to enter the ministry becoming 30 the bible says all right to enter the ministry to pay the price he could start preaching but then he still had to preach the message that would crucify him right so he was jesus the son of god the fullness of the godhead bodily so then why not go back and think about what the prophet is saying a lot of times just think simple in god he was a man i mean in god he was he was a spirit man but in body he was a man the bible says god was in christ reconciling the world and to himself god and man become one sister said out there the other night said are you going down to where uh in the scriptures where it speaks of heaven and earth kissing each other i said you've been reading the seals hadn't he she had she copied them off remember to put them down what god and man become one when jesus christ stepped on this earth god and man become one you don't have to play around and try to figure well what was this or what did he look like why what are you worried about it for that's right but just remember he looked like us because that's who we are he's not going to change us into a nut the the uh change of the body is not going to change us into another uh creature looking something just make this new so then what's he doing go ahead number six like let's see well number five or number six seven go ahead now this great creator had placed his created son now adam was his first created son jesus was his only begotten see he was begotten by a woman but adam was straight right straight from the hand of god in the creation jesus never come that away he had to come through the wound of a woman that would make him the begotten the only begotten that's why the scripture emphasizes it only begotten only begotten one because there'll never be another one like that because you'd have another god if you did no see that won't work go ahead to the next one number eight see the holy blood that was created by god the blood the life the creation of god jesus was the beginning of the creation of god oh you see it god made in creation he was spirit the bible said he is the beginning of the creation of god how did he begin in the wounds of a woman which is what the woman is not he goes on to talk about the chain but remember one thing he had to become what did it uh come on brian uh genesis 3 15. thy seed thy siege which was christ all right come on then let's go to the next one i want to get these here because i want you to get this point to where we can preach on it later god is the creator and how was he ever created but this is the beginning of the creation of god when god the spirit was created in the form of a man see come on down to man he started his journey as to being and he comes through the the creation acts and he come down to be a man god the creator himself becoming a creation god who made the dirt made the council made the polish cosmic light petroleums took the thing together and created himself in the beginning of the creation of god how was it no man has seen god at any time but the only begotten of the father has declared him i wish we'd get that point in our mind of how that he declared him he brought him out in the open he brought him out where he could be seen jesus was god made manifest in human flesh right walking up on this earth a man that was god huh that god had to pay the price of death for you and me but he's the beginning of the creation right he was a new race i want to get to that and then we'll try to get our point okay go ahead i think the next one yeah um number 10. yeah he had started a new creation now watch him what was it a creation of himself god was made flesh and dwelt among us i see he had to then come through the wound of the woman to be able to come to that position he could not be spoken into existence so adam was his created son jesus was his begotten son where he could come into being now watch god was made flesh and dwelt among us that's the bible said in the beginning of the creation of god god was created in human form in jesus christ his son god dwelt he built his tabernacle of flesh and bones and lived in that tabernacle god emmanuel god with us he built himself a house to live in it so he could reflect his word to his subjects through that you know what god is when you see jesus okay right go ahead to the next one this is revelation then when was god created is the beginning of the creation of god and god is eternal is that right but when god was created well in other words when god was created now he stopped makes his point when a little baby that was conceived in the wound of a mother in a virgin and she began to develop these cells within her bod her to bring forth this little baby that was the beginning of god's creation he's a new creation he's a new race okay all right go ahead number 12. how could god be created if he's a spirit how could he how could he be he's eternal he never was created he never will be created now look at he's been talking about him being created now he's saying he never was created what like we think the way we think of created god was never created that away adam was created that way that's why i'm reading the point over and over and over adam was that jesus was not there jesus was god made manifest in human flesh right he was god in the beginning but he is that the beginning of the creation of god was jesus when he went was the beginning of the creation of god was jesus christ when he was made manifest when god lived in him he is god's creation almighty the first and the last the amen the beginning of the creation of god when god created himself a body he come down and lived in it that's the beginning of the creation of god oh my isn't he wonderful what about it the beginning of the creation of god god created a body but not created it like adam get that see adam was created right all right jesus christ wasn't created he was birthed he was the word he was birthed in the beginning was the word word with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us all right he gave birth god gave birth to his own self in the basis that he just stepped into another form that was god in human flesh all he done when he come to this earth was took on a human flesh a body thou hast hebrews 10 5 thou has prepared me he took upon that body so he could pay the price for our sins see then he was the only begotten but that started a new race i don't want to say too much on that because i want to get the whole thing as we can into this all right we'll hit a number what do we got we got two more go ahead number 14. i believe that jesus is the son of god i believe that in his body he was a man he was born of a woman just like i was but his blood was not of a woman it was of god and jehovah god the logos who brooded over the earth and all right he was he's just like me and you he's he he could god jesus christ could give you a blood transfusion do you believe it that way i do i believe that he was so much human he could give you a blood transfusion right well that would be nice if we could get it but i thought we did get it in the new birth i thought we did get a new creation in the new birth that's where we'll get to the message next see and and keep running over that all right all right go ahead number 15. this is the one i like the logos that went out of god no regard to you catholic people he's talking about the facts of the faith and all and they talk about eternal uh sonship that don't work see roll it on up eternity which had no beginning or has no end and sun means had a beginning so how could it it could it could be a eternal god ship now who would have ever thought of that we was arguing over the godhead and he's talking about the godship he brings it eternal an eternal godship why because that's what i've been explaining all the way down has been god in this form moved over to this form and manifest himself as the word the creator moves from that form over into the next form and finally comes into human flesh then he has to give his life and that's where we're going to next where he has to give his life releasing that that was within him so he could start the new creation that he always wanted which is a new birth in you it could be an eternal godhead a never eternal sonship a son is one that was begotten so it has to begin and the logos which was the son of god went out created by these great fountains of purity god as those spirits went out and it created the logos all right so you think about it let's get let's get to the last one and then we'll god came down in a blood cell not through a man but by the holy spirit and in that virgin wound a tabernacle for the purpose of death was built the seed of the woman came in order that he be bruised to bring us our salvation when the holy ghost came upon mary he created within her wound the cell that would multiply and become the body of our lord that cell was created it was the beginning of the creation of god that that is who jesus is and that holy one was filled with holy blood even the blood of god that tabernacle came in and came to birth he grew to be a man he went to jordan and there was sacrifice was washed to john and all the river think about it think about it church a simple little story or illustrations that the prophet would bring for us to understand you're a father your son you're a human being but you're only one person well that makes the godhead understanding great to you and i because we see father son and holy ghost it's not three gods it's god manifested in many ways coming out to be the eternal god dwelling in a human being making way for a new creation then the revelations you will get it over into the next message or so where it says in the beginning of the creation of god he said this is another creation he's not dealing by ways of the old way this is a new creation you that have a new birth you have eternal life in you right by having eternal life in a new birth you're a beginning of a creation that creation started back there on the day of pentecost a new creation you're trying to figure out and i know what our thoughts are trying to figure out what was god before this what was god for i'm looking at what god is now he's now getting in finality what he always wanted but we've always understood the new birth we wondered well okay but just remember the new birth came in a mighty way because you know what your prophet said he said adam and eve could have made god a creator but that wasn't what he wanted or a father but he wouldn't want it that way he said the son of man was the way who is the son of man he was almighty god in human flesh and he spoke the word you realize he spoke you into existence as part of a new race not trying to take us away from the human race and throw us out into some other form no no but to bring forth what he always wanted his people into manifestation he was lonely is that the thing the prophet emphasized of god before the foundation of the world and all of that he was lonely he said he made adam he said he looked and adam was lonely so he made him a help meet and then through her she brought forth the manifestation of what it would be through her wound would finally come the seed of the woman that would make way for the new birth to be able to come and to be christ in you the hope of glory think on these things he's the beginning of the creation of god but around says we're the continuation he was the beginning or the first one of this new race right first one of this new race but we're the rest of that we're the finishing up and i thought we always believed in the alpha and omega form of how he started would wind up the way he you know how he ends it would be the way he would want it to be he always wanted it to come to that place it's christ in you the hope of glory the new birth but brother dale you mean the new birth is is you know you remember you think that this thing is ending up just on us in the new birth well you tell me where it ends at you tell me what it comes out to be because i'm sorry to say it but that's the way i've always studied it to try to see christ i remember back there when we were talking about god and things and he said you know you just couldn't get it clear but each day it becomes more clearer more clearer opening up to where we can see god see that's why he could walk right in here right now but you wouldn't know he was god because he wouldn't understand it to be that away so he won't walk in that way we beat him in the air but he's here anyway he's here every time he gives a new birth every time he makes a a child of god or brings it into the that's part of that original creation was back there adam and eve was an original creation spiritually speaking then they become into a physical creation which would make them first of all that type of a race or a people so what would god be like i mean he wanted if he wanted fellowship with with uh his creation you think he'd make us a bunch of monkeys and and elephants and bears and things you know no he made us like himself that's well i've always said we know for sure the way jesus is supposed to look like because the prophet said he saw him two or three times do you think he said well no he saw it two or three times did he look like hoffman's we know what he looks like if a man come in here that looked like hoffman we begin to think wouldn't it but we know that he ain't supposed to be here we wouldn't be deceived we know he's not supposed to be here we're supposed to meet him in the air but now if i met one in the air i'd want him to look like hoffman right you understand i want to reverse it i want him to look like that if i meet him in the air because that's what he's supposed to look like see we've learned a lot of things over a lot of the years now waiting to see a lot of that made manifest hope time don't run out for me but if it does i ain't gonna be worried about it i just get to beat you up get up before you do you know i'll meet you somewhere but you see if you can catch the godhead correctly you get away from trying to figure out what he looked like back there to see what he looks like now and to think about that what he looks like now was what he would look like back there amen right come on you following me you want to know what god looked like before the foundation of the world look at him now where's he at he's in his people he's in his remembered body wherever one his children were his offspring i like the way the prophet will get into that when we get to it now that he was that we're adopted we're adopted into this brought to that position let's come on musician think on these things see what we've done we've went now from god back before the world bringing down what he looks like and what he's doing how he just changes his form from one step to another and then we've come up to seeing him change his form from being that to the word not to just the word that you look across because there's the catch to what the prophet was saying i mean he said word he calls it the word he calls it the logos he calls it the theophany he calls it the anointing well what is it it's all of that together you understand he's all of that he is the word but he's not just letters on a page not a word like that he was the word that stood back there and said let there be and everything came into being he's still creating he's creating his bride amen each day that little bride gets more and more every day we get closer to god let's stand together think on these things you can follow it see we went from that we're going to this now next we'll be going because we're holding it right now because when he walked the shores of galilee that was almighty god walking on this earth he wasn't the second person or a third person he was the person of almighty god walking on the shores of galilee go ahead while we go 239 he became [Music] by grace he became me that i might become him [Music] what about [Music] oh he became several [Music] [Laughter] [Music] by times he [Music] became father in the name of our lord and savior jesus christ we lay our hands upon our sister it says by your stripes she is here so touch your eyes let everything be normal bring it back to the right we love you in jesus name amen he took my place [Music] [Music] you know what our life's going through and tormenting the heartaches and troubles and things of all of this virus [Music] our beings and our thoughts and forget us but just remember that you promised it you said by your stripes my wife thank is now make it a manifestation into life [Music] anybody else oh he became me that i might become him by grace [Music] think about it he became me that i might become him there was no way for us to ever be anything but yet if we just die out to herself and accept what he says he'll take care of it he'll work it out [Music] there's a sign on the road down here at home or something says something like we'll make it through you know [Music] you know what [Music] it's not us that's making it through he's already made it but it's just finishing up whatever whatever it takes i don't know i guess it's none of our business sometimes you try to figure something out and you you get it all figured out and everything and you sit down and say boy i got that about that time it goes haywire you see you ain't got it figured out [Music] but see there's one thing i do have figured out i know who's in my place i know who's taking my place i know how this got started on all of the doings all the creation and the things just think about it he's doing all of this to bring a bride to a place that she can be his offspring a wonderful god father we thank you we just ask you now to go with us we go eat a natural meal lord and come back together this afternoon and wade ministering unto us and we pray that you would just open our hearts and eyes to thy word forgive our sins cleanse us and guide us and show us thy ways lord in jesus name you dismissed amen he became him by grace [Applause] oh he took my place that i threw his love good day [Music]
