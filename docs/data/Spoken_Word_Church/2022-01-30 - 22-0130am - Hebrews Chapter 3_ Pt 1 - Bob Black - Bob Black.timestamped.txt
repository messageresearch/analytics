[0:06] god bless you thanks
[0:12] all right let's uh
[0:14] last time we finished up uh hebrews
[0:16] chapter one and chapter two and we're on
[0:18] chapter three and we just did a little
[0:20] quick summary
[0:21] of of kind of the whole book of hebrews
[0:24] to kind of set the
[0:25] some context
[0:27] and what paul's talking about in hebrews
[0:29] is he's trying to uh set in the minds of
[0:31] the hebrews that um who christ is and
[0:34] what he did and how he paid the price
[0:35] for us and kind of shifting their
[0:37] attention from the the
[0:39] old testament judaistic way of of of
[0:43] uh you know doing meeting the law and
[0:46] sacrifices and so forth and shifting it
[0:48] shifting their focus and over to grace
[0:51] and uh
[0:53] so some of the things if we just kind of
[0:54] go through these little bullet lists of
[0:56] of things to kind of summarize
[0:59] paul's trying to get the attention that
[1:00] the son of god is the one who who spoke
[1:03] who speaks his ultimate word of
[1:04] revelation he's the one that was
[1:06] speaking through the apostles and
[1:07] prophets and he's the one that's doing
[1:09] the talking and so therefore he's
[1:10] greater than the angels and and greater
[1:12] than moses and greater than joshua and
[1:14] greater than aaron and greater than all
[1:16] the levitical order of priests
[1:18] so he's the one he's the focus of the of
[1:20] really the old book of hebrews and so as
[1:22] high priest of an eternal order like the
[1:25] order of melchizedek christ holds a
[1:27] permanent priesthood it's something that
[1:28] uh it's it's not something that you know
[1:31] like the aaronic priesthood ever every
[1:33] once in a while you'd have to get a new
[1:34] priest in and you'd have to continually
[1:36] offer sacrifices but yet the milk priest
[1:39] priesthood after the order of
[1:40] melchizedek is is permanent and it's
[1:42] it's it's
[1:44] once the sacrifice is made it's it's
[1:46] done
[1:48] christ is also a mediator of a new
[1:50] covenant so he's fulfilling the the the
[1:52] new covenant that jeremiah talked about
[1:54] in jeremiah 31 if you go back there and
[1:56] read about jeremiah actually prophesying
[1:58] that there is a new covenant coming
[2:01] and and he did that through his his gift
[2:03] of his sacrificial death and he was both
[2:05] the the fulfillment of the type of the
[2:07] sacrificial victim and the high priest
[2:09] that offered it so he's fulfilling all
[2:11] those types
[2:12] and his sacrifices is effective to
[2:14] accomplish salvation and and it's
[2:16] unrepeatable in other words once it's
[2:18] done you don't have to keep going back
[2:20] and and doing it over and over again
[2:22] now paul as as uh we kind of
[2:25] looked at last time briefly
[2:28] when as he's going through the weight
[2:30] the way you kind of get a feel for the
[2:32] way paul paul brings things out he'll do
[2:34] a little speaking and then he'll warn
[2:36] you and he'll do a little bit more
[2:38] speaking and he'll warn you so there's a
[2:40] lot of warnings in hebrews chapter three
[2:42] in chapter four it gets gets into
[2:44] it it gets into the very serious and
[2:47] solemn subject matters talking about uh
[2:50] how the the children going uh through
[2:52] the wilderness uh how they they began to
[2:54] drift away from god's word and became
[2:56] hard-hearted and those kind of things
[2:58] and
[2:59] all through the book of hebrews paul's
[3:01] giving warnings and in chapter two he's
[3:03] given a warning not to drift away from
[3:06] god's word and not to in chapter three
[3:08] and verse four not to be
[3:09] three in chapter four not to be
[3:11] hard-hearted and unresponsive and
[3:14] chapter five and chapter six not to
[3:16] remain spiritually immature in chapter
[3:18] 10 not to be disloyal to christ in
[3:20] chapter 12 not to refuse god's word
[3:23] and to press on the maturity in in jesus
[3:26] and then chapter 9 to to to press on to
[3:29] the new covenant that he initiated and
[3:32] the whole the whole book is really just
[3:34] uh
[3:35] a a a positive message to keep pressing
[3:38] forward in the face of adversity and
[3:39] suffering and and all kinds of the the
[3:42] things that come upon a believer through
[3:44] life
[3:46] so let's let's read if we'll go to the
[3:47] next slide let's start reading this
[3:49] let's read the chapter of hebrews
[3:51] chapter three
[3:53] and get into this
[3:55] there's some good things here
[3:58] so chapter verse 1 says wherefore holy
[4:00] brethren partakers of the heavenly
[4:02] calling consider the apostle and high
[4:04] priest of our profession christ jesus
[4:07] who was faithful to them that appointed
[4:09] him as also moses was faithful in all
[4:11] his house
[4:13] but this man was counted worthy of more
[4:14] glory than moses
[4:16] in as much as he who hath builded the
[4:18] house hath more honor than the house
[4:20] for every house is builded by some man
[4:22] but he that built all things is god
[4:26] and moses verily was faithful in all his
[4:28] house
[4:29] as a servant for a testimony of those
[4:31] things which were to be spoken after but
[4:33] christ as a son over his own house whose
[4:36] house are we if we hold fast to
[4:37] confidence and the rejoicing of the hope
[4:39] firm unto the end
[4:41] wherefore the next lie
[4:43] as the holy ghost saith today if you
[4:46] will hear his voice harden not your
[4:48] hearts as in the provocation
[4:50] and the day of temptation in the
[4:52] wilderness
[4:53] when your fathers tempted me prove me
[4:55] and saw my works forty years
[4:58] wherefore i was grieved with that
[4:59] generation
[5:00] and said they do always air in their
[5:02] heart and they have not known my ways
[5:05] so i swear in my wrath they shall not
[5:07] enter into my rest
[5:09] take heed brethren lest there be any in
[5:11] any of you an evil heart of unbelief and
[5:13] departing from the living god but exhort
[5:15] one another daily what it is called
[5:17] today
[5:18] lest any of you be hardened through the
[5:19] deceitfulness of sin
[5:21] for we are made partakers of christ if
[5:23] we hold the beginning of our confidence
[5:25] steadfast unto the end
[5:27] while it is said today if you will hear
[5:29] his voice
[5:30] pardon not your hearts as in the
[5:32] provocation
[5:33] for some when they had heard did provoke
[5:35] howbeit not all that came out of egypt
[5:37] by moses
[5:38] but with whom was he greed forty years
[5:40] was it not with them that had sinned
[5:41] whose carcasses fell in the wilderness
[5:43] and to whoms where he that they should
[5:45] not enter into his rest but to them that
[5:47] believe not
[5:48] so we see that they cannot enter in
[5:50] because of unbelief
[5:52] so you can kind of see that
[5:54] the topic of hebrews chapter three is
[5:56] the children of israel journeying
[5:58] through the wilderness they begin to
[6:00] disbelieve and and and provoke god
[6:03] so i want to just kind of examine some
[6:06] of the things that they did to provoke
[6:07] god and and you can look back and and
[6:09] see um
[6:12] learn by their mistakes maybe and and
[6:15] kind of apply it to our life and and and
[6:17] see if
[6:19] you know if they were not able to go
[6:20] into the promise into the promised land
[6:23] because of the things that they did and
[6:24] the doubt that they did
[6:26] then
[6:27] uh we we should be ever d that paul is
[6:30] giving us a warning to be diligent
[6:33] so if we go to the next lie
[6:36] and we'll start kind of diving into this
[6:37] some of these things that paul said he
[6:39] said so in the first one wherefore holy
[6:41] brother and partakers of the heavenly
[6:42] calling consider the apostle and high
[6:44] priest of our profession christ jesus
[6:46] who was faithful to him that appointed
[6:47] him as also moses was faithful and on
[6:50] his house
[6:51] it's it's interesting that
[6:53] a lot of the things that paul says
[6:55] he's actually almost like every other
[6:57] sentence that he says he's quoting
[6:59] something from the old testament and you
[7:01] could just imagine that
[7:04] people sitting around listening to paul
[7:05] that that um
[7:07] you know they would recognize things
[7:08] that he would say and it's
[7:10] and realize that he's he's actually just
[7:11] saying stating the word to them
[7:14] he's preaching exactly what the what the
[7:16] what the scripture had said that they
[7:18] were familiar with
[7:19] so he's quoting from numbers chapter 12
[7:21] that says my servant moses is not so who
[7:23] is faithful in all my house and this is
[7:25] the this is where god was was talking to
[7:27] them after miriam and aaron began to
[7:29] doubt whether moses was really called to
[7:31] leave whether he was the only one that
[7:33] that that that god would be speaking to
[7:36] and they began to doubt and and and god
[7:38] told him moses is faithful in all mine
[7:40] house
[7:42] now we know a house is a house is a
[7:44] whole kingdom as a house is a uh
[7:47] everything that you own every house is
[7:49] all all of your belongings and your
[7:50] properties and all that all that goes
[7:52] into that but really if you want to just
[7:54] steal it distill it down a house is
[7:55] where you live so
[7:57] and and we're
[7:59] if as you read along you'll find out
[8:00] that that
[8:02] paul's kind of setting in your mind that
[8:04] god is a builder
[8:06] and he's
[8:07] all uh you know in
[8:09] in hebrews chapter one he talked about
[8:11] how the worlds are framed by the word of
[8:12] god and and and it framed up so god's
[8:15] framing things up and he's building
[8:17] things he built the universe
[8:19] he spun the the worlds off of his
[8:21] fingers he spun the galaxies off of his
[8:23] finger by the word by the word of his
[8:24] mouth he spoke everything into existence
[8:27] and framed it up and and our little
[8:29] earth that we live on and and so then if
[8:32] you if you go to the next slide he
[8:34] begins to talk about this house there's
[8:36] a there's a builder god is the builder
[8:39] and and the one that that uh
[8:42] if we read this in chapter in verse two
[8:43] it says he was faithful to him that had
[8:45] appointed him as also moses was faithful
[8:47] and on his house for this man was
[8:48] counted worthy of more glory than moses
[8:51] and as much as he was building the house
[8:53] have more honor than the house
[8:55] for every house is builded by some man
[8:58] but he that built all things as god
[9:01] so he's talking about he's talking about
[9:03] all that god is really the master
[9:05] builder
[9:06] but he's made us workmen
[9:08] in that in that process
[9:10] now
[9:11] you think now
[9:13] what what he's getting at is is that the
[9:15] children of israel were they were
[9:17] provoked they provoked god by
[9:19] disbelieving the building process
[9:23] so in if you go to the next slide in
[9:25] exodus chapter 25
[9:27] uh god commissioned moses we know he
[9:29] commissioned him to make let them make
[9:31] me a sanctuary that i may dwell among
[9:33] them so he's telling moses to go build
[9:35] build in my house
[9:37] and if we go to the next slide we'll
[9:39] just run through some scriptures quickly
[9:41] that in hebrews 11 through faith we
[9:43] understand that the worlds were framed
[9:45] by the word of god and and verse 10 for
[9:47] he looked for a city
[9:49] talking about job or abraham which have
[9:51] foundations whose builder and maker is
[9:54] god so god is the builder and the maker
[9:56] and i say also unto thee that thou art
[9:58] peter jesus telling peter and upon this
[10:00] rock i will build my church and the
[10:02] gates of hell shall not prevail it so
[10:04] god's the one he's he's the master
[10:06] builder
[10:08] and in first corinthians chapter 3 verse
[10:10] 9 to 12 if we go to the next slide
[10:12] for we are laborers together with god
[10:15] ye are god's husbandry ye are god's
[10:18] building
[10:19] according to the grace of god which is
[10:21] given unto me as a wise master builder i
[10:23] have laid the foundation and another
[10:25] build of their own but let every man
[10:27] take heed how he buildeth their poem for
[10:29] other foundation can no man lay then
[10:31] that is laid
[10:32] which is jesus christ
[10:35] and if we go to the next slide in first
[10:37] peter chapter 2 it says ye also as
[10:38] lively stones are built up a spiritual
[10:41] house
[10:42] because god is the builder he's a master
[10:44] builder and he he he yokes us into that
[10:46] process so that we have something to do
[10:48] in that we we we're we're preaching
[10:49] we're we're giving the word to people
[10:52] and and and building one another up like
[10:55] first thessalonians says wherefore
[10:57] comfort yourselves together and edify
[10:59] one another even as also you do
[11:01] and edify means to build up
[11:03] and edify comes from that from the word
[11:06] edifice edifice edifice is the thing
[11:08] being built and to edify means to build
[11:11] up
[11:11] and that's what paul was talking about
[11:13] in ephesians chapter four he gave some
[11:15] apostles and some prophets and some
[11:16] evangelists and some pastors and
[11:18] teachers for the edifying of the body of
[11:21] christ to build up
[11:23] now so so that whole process now
[11:26] you you go back to
[11:28] hebrews chapter three what paul is
[11:30] talking about he's talking about moses
[11:32] going through the wilderness and he's
[11:34] keeps telling the people you're able to
[11:36] take the promised land god has got us
[11:37] here and he sends a pillar of fire and
[11:39] all these things and he's given them a
[11:41] word and he and and yet the people begin
[11:43] to to doubt the word the message that
[11:46] he's given to them
[11:47] to doubt they they continually doubt
[11:49] that god is able to quench their thirst
[11:51] from a rock they doubt that he's able to
[11:54] quench their hunger by giving a manna
[11:55] from heaven
[11:57] they doubt that they're able to defeat
[11:58] the giants that they have the power to
[12:00] go into that promised land and so
[12:02] they're doubting they're doubting the
[12:04] message so it's the message that they're
[12:06] doubting in other words they're doubting
[12:07] that god is trying to build up their
[12:09] faith and build up build them up to a
[12:11] place that where they can go into the
[12:13] promised land and by faith conquer
[12:16] and they begin to doubt
[12:18] now the process
[12:19] see the process now that god builds us
[12:22] up he builds he's building us up by by
[12:24] the word so that's why he he's given us
[12:27] teaching now now brother ram said
[12:29] in in
[12:31] adoption number one if we go to the next
[12:33] slide
[12:35] preaching usually catches the center
[12:36] brings them under condemnation by the
[12:38] word but teaching places a man
[12:40] positionally what he is in other words
[12:42] teaching is what what what gives you the
[12:44] ability to know what you believe
[12:46] when it's teached you
[12:48] when the word is taught then you you
[12:50] know how to be baptized you know what
[12:52] the name of god is you know whether or
[12:54] not god is divided up in three people or
[12:56] one god and and teaching begins to place
[12:57] you positionally so that you you can
[12:59] have confidence that you're able to
[13:01] defeat the goliath that you're able to
[13:04] go into the land and and partake of
[13:06] those grapes and partake of that those
[13:08] promises that god has given to you so
[13:10] the teaching
[13:11] you know that
[13:12] people kind of get uh get hung up on on
[13:14] on teaching maybe because it's hard and
[13:16] and uh maybe not as uh it's it's a
[13:19] little bit different than than you know
[13:21] when you go to a camp meeting and
[13:22] there's and everybody's around the altar
[13:24] and lots of shouting and things teaching
[13:26] settles you down in teaching because
[13:28] teaching gets you to a place where you
[13:30] know what you believe
[13:31] teaching teaching places a man
[13:33] positionally what he is now that's why i
[13:36] believe that you know paul said in ii
[13:37] timothy he said study
[13:39] study to show thyself approved unto god
[13:42] a workman in other words a builder
[13:44] somebody that's building what god wants
[13:46] us to build somebody that can this
[13:49] that's participating in god's work
[13:51] that needeth not to be ashamed rightly
[13:53] dividing the word of truth how are you
[13:55] going to know how to divide the truth
[13:57] from the error if you don't study
[13:59] i believe that this is a study in church
[14:01] you know i i was thinking about this
[14:02] morning how you know standing out there
[14:04] with terrence some mornings you you hear
[14:06] people coming in
[14:07] in the parking lot and they're playing
[14:09] sermons
[14:10] and and uh and
[14:12] we we study the word because we believe
[14:15] in teaching but teaching and teaching is
[14:17] important because it shows you where you
[14:19] are and what you what what you're doing
[14:22] and i believe i believe that when you're
[14:24] called to preach you're called to study
[14:26] if you don't study then what what do you
[14:28] have to say you you get up and maybe uh
[14:30] say a few things about how god is good
[14:32] and and and god died for our sins and
[14:34] things but yet there's there's we we've
[14:36] got to study so that we can we're
[14:38] because we're we're we're working with
[14:40] god we have something we're trying to
[14:42] build up the faith of the people
[14:45] study to show thyself approved unto god
[14:47] because god wants us to know what the
[14:49] promises are
[14:51] now so in matthew chapter 28 verse 19 it
[14:53] says go you therefore and
[14:55] have you ever noticed that go you
[14:57] therefore and teach
[14:58] teach all nations
[15:00] go there go therefore and teach all
[15:02] nations teaching them to observe all
[15:04] things whatsoever i have commanded you
[15:06] and lo
[15:07] i am with you always even under the end
[15:09] of the world now what's what's this got
[15:11] to do with hebrews 3 again now they
[15:13] began to doubt the promises of god they
[15:16] began to doubt moses message they began
[15:18] to doubt that his commission was to take
[15:20] them out of egypt and take them into the
[15:22] promised land
[15:24] now you see all all through all through
[15:26] scripture there's this pattern repeated
[15:28] that when there's a message goes forth
[15:30] there's the enemies that come up against
[15:32] it like like what brother wade was
[15:33] preaching on wednesday night if we go to
[15:35] the next slide about in daniel 70 weeks
[15:37] when nehemiah and ezra began to build
[15:39] the the the temple wall the walls around
[15:42] the city and and it and it says that
[15:44] their enemies the enemies heard that
[15:46] that that they were they were doing
[15:48] their work and that we returned all of
[15:50] us to the wall everyone into his work
[15:52] and the bible says
[15:54] i'm just kind of trying to go through
[15:55] this quickly that began to work with
[15:57] with they began to work with a a sword
[16:00] in one hand and their trial and the
[16:01] other because
[16:03] you know when whenever whenever you try
[16:04] to do something for god you're always
[16:06] going to have somebody some somebody to
[16:08] come up to complain or tell you it's not
[16:10] working right
[16:11] that's what paul's talking about in
[16:13] hebrews chapter three
[16:15] the whole wilderness journey moses
[16:17] constantly had a constant stream of
[16:20] you're not doing it right i don't
[16:21] believe you're called i don't believe
[16:23] this and that but you just keep forging
[16:25] on
[16:26] keep moving ahead ignore all the
[16:27] naysayers because there's a work for you
[16:29] to do and the work is to build what god
[16:32] commissioned you to build
[16:34] so and if we go back go to the next
[16:36] slide
[16:38] paul's saying
[16:40] today if you will hear his voice
[16:42] harden not your heart as in the
[16:44] provocation
[16:45] do not harden your heart against the
[16:47] message of god that he's given to you
[16:48] think about how the children of israel's
[16:50] heart became so hard even to the point
[16:52] when when moses went up to bring down
[16:54] the ten commandments the revelation of
[16:56] god to them that their heart was so hard
[16:59] that they made a golden calf
[17:01] that they forgot what their purpose was
[17:03] what they forgot what they were there to
[17:05] do
[17:07] today if you will hear his voice
[17:09] now in the next slide i've got a little
[17:11] a little picture of sam or they're
[17:12] listening so
[17:14] it's so often that we fail to recognize
[17:16] when we hear god's voice like samuel
[17:18] there so uh you know
[17:20] he heard the voice of god in in the
[17:22] night and he and he woke up and he kept
[17:23] going over to to to the to the high
[17:26] priest
[17:27] to ask him if that was him and finally
[17:29] he recognized he got still and along
[17:31] with god began to recognize that god was
[17:33] speaking to him so that's what paul is
[17:35] talking about if you don't harden your
[17:37] heart but listen to the voice of god
[17:38] when god
[17:39] when he begins to pulsate down in your
[17:41] heart
[17:42] you recognize that that's god's speaking
[17:44] to you and moving on your heart to
[17:47] to build up your faith within you
[17:50] so on the next slide in the voice of the
[17:52] sign brother brown said
[17:55] that was only 40 miles
[17:57] about 40 years doing it it was because
[18:00] that they began to murmur against the
[18:02] voice that produced a sign
[18:04] how little did they know when they were
[18:06] shouting down there on the banks and
[18:08] dancing in the spirit and moses singing
[18:09] in the spirit there was only just a few
[18:11] days off
[18:13] but they began to murmur and wanted to
[18:14] do something different and they stayed
[18:16] 40 years in the wilderness and perished
[18:19] over it that's right because they didn't
[18:21] believe
[18:22] god said they're not talking against you
[18:24] moses they're talking against me
[18:26] that was god's voice
[18:28] not moses
[18:30] now they were all they were all going to
[18:32] church and they were all going in the
[18:33] sanctuary of the lord and and and doing
[18:36] the things that believers look it looks
[18:37] like believers do but yet they began to
[18:39] doubt the voice
[18:42] the void now now i i kind of want to
[18:44] bring this down a little bit as we just
[18:46] have a few more minutes to to close
[18:49] before we really get into the meat of
[18:50] this chapter
[18:52] but you know it's easy to think to
[18:55] recognize that the the voice it was that
[18:57] brother branham had the voice but bring
[18:59] it down actually to where you know
[19:01] you're sitting in church and a minister
[19:03] speaking to you and and you know you can
[19:05] begin to to doubt that the minister's
[19:07] saying the right thing or that the
[19:08] things that the minister of the or that
[19:10] your mama and daddy are saying let's
[19:12] bring it on down now
[19:14] because brother ram said in the
[19:15] laodicean church age he said the voice
[19:18] god still has a voice for the people of
[19:20] the world even as he's given a voice to
[19:22] the bride that voice is in the bride
[19:24] now what does that you know when the
[19:26] children of israel were going over to
[19:27] cadence barney and and they listened to
[19:29] the voice of moses all that time and
[19:31] then finally they sent over the ten to
[19:33] ten spies into the land and they came
[19:35] back and they all had a voice and joshua
[19:38] and caleb had that they came back with
[19:40] the same voice
[19:41] that moses had
[19:43] we're able to take the land the giants
[19:45] ain't going to be nothing to us because
[19:46] we got with god with us
[19:48] so they had they came back with that
[19:50] same message
[19:51] so if you're saying the same message
[19:54] you're preaching the same thing
[19:56] you've got that same voice
[19:58] now in revelation chapter one i'm just
[20:00] kind of quickly going through these
[20:01] things revelation chapter 1 verse 13
[20:04] to 15 says looking at when john turned
[20:07] to look at the son of man and his feet
[20:09] like undefined brass as if they burned
[20:10] in the furnace and his voice says the
[20:12] sound of many waters and waters is
[20:15] people so they now they were all saying
[20:17] the same thing they had the same
[20:18] confession just like jeremiah in chapter
[20:20] 33 said the voice of joy and the voice
[20:23] of gladness the voice of the bridegroom
[20:25] and the voice of the bride so the
[20:26] bride's got a voice too
[20:28] so
[20:29] what's the point the point is don't
[20:31] harden your heart when you hear the
[20:33] voice it don't matter if it comes from a
[20:35] donkey if it's the voice of god
[20:37] listen to it because it's the voice
[20:39] don't don't harden your heart to the
[20:41] promises of god
[20:43] now
[20:45] now let's think about the children of
[20:46] israel as they were coming out of egypt
[20:48] we know we know what an exodus is and
[20:50] and uh
[20:51] if you go to the next slide
[20:54] the hebrews chapter three is really
[20:56] focusing on that that kind of middle
[20:58] period as they had come out of egypt and
[21:00] they were on their way into the promised
[21:01] land so what's an exodus an exodus is an
[21:04] exodus is going out of coming out of and
[21:06] going into
[21:08] and so the exodus the children of israel
[21:10] they came out of egypt and they went
[21:11] through the wilderness on the way to the
[21:13] promised land and they couldn't quite
[21:14] make it to the promised land now we know
[21:16] that types compare that to justification
[21:19] the sanctification of baptism in the
[21:21] holy ghost the three stages of your
[21:23] journey
[21:24] and brother ram taught that there was
[21:25] three exoduses
[21:28] it was the children of israel from
[21:29] coming out of that this one that paul
[21:31] was talking about from egypt to the
[21:33] promised land
[21:34] and then there was that the second
[21:36] exodus was from a spiritual condition
[21:38] from judaism
[21:39] to the baptism of the holy ghost from
[21:41] turning malachi chapter 4 turning the
[21:43] fathers
[21:44] the fathers to the children the faith of
[21:46] the fathers to the children pivoting
[21:48] them over to that to to understanding
[21:50] that god was able to he paid the price
[21:52] for their sins and was able to fill them
[21:53] with the holy ghost and then now the
[21:55] third exodus is to turn our hearts back
[21:57] to the original faith of the pentecostal
[21:59] fathers to turn our to to call out a
[22:02] bride
[22:03] from the church
[22:04] now these are the things that brother
[22:05] brown actually said from a spiritual
[22:07] condition to the baptism of the holy
[22:08] ghost and from the church to the bride
[22:11] and that's what the voice does to call
[22:13] us
[22:14] so so brother brown said in hebrews
[22:16] chapter 4 when he was preaching this in
[22:18] 1957 he said
[22:20] and now you've got a free choice
[22:22] god broods back to you and say hear my
[22:24] voice
[22:25] harden not your heart like in the days
[22:27] of provocation here he comes down
[22:30] preaches the word
[22:32] the gospel preached unto them was not
[22:34] didn't have faith in it so it didn't do
[22:35] them no good
[22:37] they heard it but they didn't believe it
[22:39] god come down he showed them a pillar of
[22:41] fire
[22:43] showed by his prophets signs and wonders
[22:45] he was with him
[22:46] they didn't believe it oh they like to
[22:48] see the miracles they like to hear the
[22:50] prophet but as far as believing it they
[22:53] didn't their lives proves they didn't
[22:56] now he said don't you fall after that
[22:59] same example of unbelief
[23:01] or in this last days to the gentile
[23:03] church god has appeared again same sign
[23:06] same wonder same pillar of fire
[23:09] vindicated proven
[23:10] let us not harden our hearts and fall in
[23:13] that temptation back yonder
[23:15] of unbelief
[23:16] but we'll rot on earth and that'll be
[23:19] all of it
[23:22] now
[23:23] so what will they they provoke god by
[23:25] their unbelief
[23:26] and by their unbelief
[23:28] they were unable to move forward
[23:30] so let now i i've only got a few more
[23:32] minutes but i want to i really wanted to
[23:35] dive into the things that they did to
[23:37] provoke god because there's lessons in
[23:39] here that we can learn from
[23:42] as you as you look back and see see see
[23:44] how they failed now there's really
[23:46] there's 14 provocations 14 things that
[23:49] they did and and uh when they when they
[23:52] finally got to cadence barnea god
[23:53] actually there's a scripture where god
[23:55] was telling moses
[23:56] you've they've they've messed up ten
[23:58] times already they've
[24:00] there's ten provocations then after that
[24:03] there were four more
[24:05] let's start back when moses first got
[24:07] his commission if you go to the next
[24:08] life
[24:09] and exodus chapter five
[24:12] when
[24:14] this is talking about when they when
[24:15] moses began to go to pharaoh and tell
[24:17] him i'm going to you need to let my
[24:19] people go and pharaoh gave him more work
[24:21] to do
[24:22] and it says the offers of the children
[24:24] of israel did see that they were in evil
[24:26] case after it was said you shall not
[24:28] minish all from your bricks of your
[24:29] daily task
[24:31] and they met moses and aaron who stood
[24:33] in the way as they came forth from
[24:34] pharaoh
[24:35] and they said unto them the lord look
[24:37] upon you and judge
[24:39] because you have made our savior to be
[24:40] abhorred in the eyes of pharaoh
[24:43] and in the eyes of his servants to put a
[24:45] sword in their hand to slay us
[24:47] so they began to they began to trust in
[24:49] moses and put their confidence in him
[24:51] and and he went and made his testimony
[24:54] to to pharaoh and it looked like things
[24:56] got worse for him now now you know apply
[24:59] that to your own christian life maybe
[25:00] when you first began to be a christian
[25:02] that things like seem like they they
[25:04] kind of began to get in some cases worse
[25:06] for you now you had you had to live it
[25:09] in front of your people at work and
[25:10] maybe they started to hate i've heard
[25:12] testimonies from people talking about
[25:14] the the rough time that their co-workers
[25:16] have given them and and and different
[25:18] thing because many times it's it's uh
[25:21] there's some rough spots that you have
[25:22] to go through as a christian
[25:24] now so they they they they started off
[25:27] with a little rough spot it looked like
[25:28] there was more work for there was more
[25:30] work that they had to do and they began
[25:32] to say well you know what it'd be better
[25:34] for us to just stay down here in egypt
[25:36] and not have all this work pile on us
[25:38] and they begin to doubt what were they
[25:40] doubting they were they were doubting
[25:41] that god had something better in the
[25:43] store for them that if they just trust
[25:44] in the word of god that god would lead
[25:46] them to a promised land but yet they
[25:48] doubted because for just a little bit it
[25:50] got more grief griesson
[25:52] you know
[25:53] some many times being a christian is is
[25:56] full of grief and full of strife and and
[25:58] and and not a bed of roses and so but a
[26:02] real christian now you you go back if
[26:04] you if you listen to what uh brother
[26:06] brown said in hebrews chapter four when
[26:07] he was preaching this sermon
[26:09] he said when when troubles come you got
[26:11] to keep pressing on don't do like these
[26:14] these hebrews children and and begin to
[26:16] doubt and wonder if god and the
[26:18] musicians can go ahead and come begin to
[26:20] doubt if god still loves you and if he's
[26:22] still going to fulfill his promises in
[26:23] your life
[26:25] but keep pressing on and believing his
[26:27] word
[26:28] don't harden your heart as in the
[26:30] provocation
[26:31] and we'll stop right there and continue
[26:33] on next time
[26:35] [Applause]
[26:40] you
