[29:38] the house of the Lord you like turning
[29:40] your scriptures turn back where we read
[29:42] this morning to
[29:44] Hebrews to Revelations 3 and then into
[29:49] Romans
[29:51] 8 Revelations
[29:54] 3 Romans 8 remember all the
[29:56] announcements have been made and things
[29:58] and keep a thing in mind keep praying
[30:00] for these that are sick like sister Lora
[30:03] and all and remember the fellowship
[30:05] meeting will be there on the third
[30:07] Saturday in September and remember all
[30:11] the other announcements that have been
[30:13] made the ones that are missing today and
[30:16] the reasons and things just pray that
[30:17] the Lord would would bless each one amen
[30:22] any announcements we need to
[30:24] make oh yes one thing
[30:28] now we're trying to change around
[30:29] downstairs we get everybody while he
[30:31] standing up okay that way you can't
[30:34] claim you ain't
[30:36] hearing uh we're trying to change around
[30:38] things downstairs a little bit to where
[30:40] we can have the Sunday School classes so
[30:43] you'll see a curtain pulled across and
[30:45] you that are late coming in you know
[30:48] you're supposed to come through that
[30:49] other main part of the door not the main
[30:52] one coming up to stairs and to do your
[30:54] thing but make sure you go in there if
[30:56] you got to and be real quiet because
[30:58] they're going to be having Sunday school
[31:00] class just behind a curtain so don't be
[31:03] fooling around in there and I don't
[31:06] understand is why you can't get here
[31:07] before service you know before time and
[31:10] when they announce downstairs that we're
[31:12] supposed to be out at a certain time uh
[31:16] when that Bell Rings you're supposed to
[31:17] be out of there and get gone all right
[31:21] go on to where you're going to and don't
[31:23] hang around and and want to sit there
[31:25] and talk cuz they're they're trying to
[31:27] get get everything in order see we we're
[31:29] not set up in a big place so we have to
[31:32] uh you know the children has to start
[31:34] over here and then they're getting
[31:36] through before the rest of us can be
[31:39] going that way we're not flooding the
[31:42] coming up stars for the bathrooms so
[31:44] that gets everybody kind of in order but
[31:47] if you don't follow it in the other
[31:48] things you'll mess it up and and all
[31:51] like that so just remember that and keep
[31:54] it all kids glasses start 15
[31:59] minutes all the children's classes start
[32:02] at 15 minutes till 10 getting through 15
[32:06] after and that way they can get up and
[32:09] then waiting them starts at 15 till or
[32:13] whenever they can get everybody in the
[32:14] room you
[32:16] know but then they they get out and try
[32:20] to get up so remember these things and
[32:22] do it we really enjoy the kids want to
[32:25] give them a good hand we appreciate the
[32:27] kids for their part in the singing in
[32:30] the worshiping things and and praising
[32:33] the Lord okay any other
[32:35] announcement okay Heavenly Father we
[32:38] thank you for your grace and guidance
[32:40] Lord thank you for all things and we
[32:43] pray that you would just bless us now
[32:45] with your presence this afternoon and
[32:48] Lord we're confessing that you're here
[32:50] so we're going to believe that
[32:51] everything will be all right and all the
[32:53] service will be great and it'll all be
[32:54] in your honor and Glory we ask you to
[32:57] just have your way with each one of us
[32:58] remember the sick among us and remember
[33:01] what you said we're just confessing the
[33:04] words you said you said you would send
[33:07] your word and heal us and Deliver Us
[33:08] from destruction so we confess that and
[33:11] father we just thank you and just have
[33:13] your way now in the service remember the
[33:15] sick among us and take away that
[33:17] sicknesses and things because that is
[33:19] part of your atonement guide each one
[33:22] now have your way in Jesus name amen
[33:26] remember remember to pray too for the uh
[33:29] brother Homer Fraser passed away so
[33:31] remember to pray for the family there
[33:34] the Lord would would be with with all of
[33:36] them you know in that time and he's been
[33:38] having a lot of trouble and uh but he's
[33:41] passed on to his
[33:43] reward all right Revelations
[33:47] 3:14 and the angel of the Church of the
[33:50] lady of candr these things sayth the
[33:52] amen the faithful and true witness the
[33:55] beginning of the creation of God
[33:58] all right we go to Romans 8 beginning
[34:01] verse
[34:02] 24 for we are
[34:05] saved by hope now that's not hope like I
[34:08] hope it that's where we read the Bible
[34:11] and we interpret the wording but go back
[34:13] and see what it's saying we're Saved By
[34:16] Faith right all right for we are saved
[34:19] by hope now watch but hope that is seen
[34:24] is not hope for what a man seeth why
[34:27] does he hope for for what a man seeth
[34:31] why does he yet hope for it but if we
[34:34] hope for that which we see not see then
[34:37] there is past things there's present
[34:39] things there are things that will
[34:42] come all right all the way through he's
[34:45] covering it but if we hope for that we
[34:48] see not then do we with patience wait
[34:52] for it we'll get two sicknesses healing
[34:56] you say you're
[34:57] healed sometimes you got to wait
[35:00] right because that's just God's way of
[35:02] doing it okay then he says likewise the
[35:05] spirit also help with our infirmities
[35:08] for we know not what we should pray for
[35:10] as we ought but the spirit itself maketh
[35:13] intercession for us with gr groanings
[35:16] which cannot be uttered and he that
[35:19] searcheth the
[35:21] hearts knoweth what is the mind of the
[35:24] spirit because he maketh intercession
[35:27] for the Saints according to the will of
[35:30] God so you may be seated the Lord add
[35:32] his Blessing to the reading of the word
[35:34] now we were talking about this
[35:36] morning how that we must
[35:41] confess now this afternoon we're going
[35:43] to try to cover over into the point and
[35:47] we won't have the questions and answers
[35:49] Wednesday if you want to we'll have them
[35:51] next Sunday if that's fine because we
[35:55] won't have them Wednesday cuz I've got a
[35:57] message that's I've got to put behind
[36:00] this one to bring forth and continue the
[36:03] thought if we get to Wednesday night we
[36:05] will have some questions so have it on
[36:08] your mind all right now what was we
[36:12] talking about this
[36:14] morning according to Hebrews 3 and
[36:18] 1 he is the high
[36:20] priest of our
[36:22] profession all right profession and
[36:25] confession is the same word right all
[36:29] right so he's the high priest now as I
[36:32] said this morning why would the bible
[36:35] say that he's the high priest of our
[36:40] confession why does it say
[36:45] that what does it say he's the high
[36:47] priest of our confession what did it
[36:51] just to
[36:52] say you have a
[36:55] confession
[36:57] and then it says he's the high
[37:02] priest what do you need a high priest
[37:08] for but we got to have
[37:12] one now we we brought it to P I brought
[37:15] it down this morning trying to show the
[37:19] point that heaven is
[37:23] real and it's not just that God is
[37:25] setting up there now and the Bible said
[37:28] as it bring out this morning that he was
[37:30] sitting on the throne you know
[37:31] resurrecting sitting in Heavenly places
[37:33] we're supposed to be that don't mean
[37:35] we're out there does it but it means
[37:38] we're resurrected in spiritually and see
[37:40] he's not just laying up a throne a
[37:43] body no life in it or nothing that's
[37:46] just
[37:47] terminologies as I hope you were
[37:49] catching this morning that to me God is
[37:53] very busy Heaven is a busy Place y
[37:57] all right and if he's making
[37:59] intercession Upon Our
[38:00] confession as I said this morning even
[38:03] if you had you know 100,000 people
[38:06] praying you realize he's making
[38:09] intercession upon 100,000
[38:12] prayers and he's the high priest of that
[38:15] see we need the high priest because the
[38:17] high priest is the only one that can
[38:19] make the
[38:20] atonement that's right right the high
[38:24] priest now we're talking about the main
[38:25] atoma they were priest that made this
[38:27] and priest that made offerings but the
[38:29] main atonement to Israel was to be made
[38:33] by the yearly high priest all right and
[38:38] see then him being the high
[38:41] priest he was capable of making an
[38:45] atonement amen we say well he made the
[38:48] atonement 2,000 years ago yeah but to
[38:52] him it doesn't matter where it would be
[38:54] 10 million years ago or 10 million years
[38:58] after now he has no time and no thoughts
[39:01] of
[39:02] time all right but my point was this
[39:06] morning that he's doing something
[39:09] amen he's making
[39:12] intercession Upon Our confession amen
[39:16] right right now we're going to deal with
[39:18] a lot brother Brown says this evening
[39:21] that he can't do it until you confess it
[39:25] well you can do anything you want
[39:27] two he's Bound by his
[39:30] word if his word says he can't do it
[39:33] he's Bound by it that's right you want a
[39:37] scripture he said our sins was in the
[39:39] sea of
[39:40] forgetfulness he's Bound by that
[39:43] scripture he cannot bring that Sin from
[39:46] under n amen the blood if it's been put
[39:49] under there he's Bound by his own I've
[39:52] got one in here where brother R said
[39:54] he's
[39:55] bound the we're not just looking at it
[39:58] like a halfhazard
[40:01] thing when God says something it must
[40:04] come to
[40:05] pass but as I saying this morning now
[40:07] the thought was what everything that's
[40:10] in the
[40:12] Bible has been spoke by someone yes
[40:17] writing speaking it prophets talking
[40:19] whatever uh Noah telling about the world
[40:22] and what it would be and and you know
[40:25] anything that you want to relate to it's
[40:28] always been because somebody said
[40:31] it and he's waiting for somebody to say
[40:34] it amen all right now here's the point
[40:39] we'll get to Wednesday night he's
[40:40] waiting on you and I you know that
[40:42] everything waiting on you and
[40:44] I to do
[40:48] what I got to get away but I will make
[40:51] this
[40:52] statement what's he waiting on us to
[40:55] do
[41:00] well we can do this well we can do that
[41:01] we can do that what's he waiting
[41:07] on now if he is the high priest of our
[41:11] confession he's waiting on somebody to
[41:14] confess
[41:16] it and until it's confessed by
[41:20] someone that really has the goods of
[41:22] confessing
[41:24] it it won't never happen
[41:26] that's right we taught the end of the
[41:29] world 50 years ago 50 years ago we were
[41:33] talking about the coming of Jesus Christ
[41:36] I'm just saying in my life in your lives
[41:38] most of you where you
[41:40] were that we were talking about those
[41:45] things but why has it been we've been
[41:48] given 50 years after the going of the
[41:50] Prophet right what's God waiting
[41:55] on
[42:02] okay now if he's making
[42:06] intercession that means he's doing
[42:08] something right right he says he made
[42:12] inter intercession that would be ped
[42:16] right see I'm trying to get you to look
[42:18] at calvary's present
[42:20] tense look at Salvation is present tense
[42:23] it do you no good what good is to talk
[42:26] about a
[42:28] pist that's Faith Builder
[42:32] yes but the pist is not reality to me
[42:35] and
[42:37] you
[42:39] right oh I live yeah yeah okay but
[42:41] you're not getting
[42:43] it God's wanting somebody to stand here
[42:46] now and confess it that he can make it
[42:49] come to P all right now because he's
[42:54] making intercession
[42:57] upon what we
[43:00] confess all right we ended up by saying
[43:06] what can God confess a
[43:09] trinity that was the ending of the
[43:13] message no cuz there's no such
[43:16] thing can he confess that hell is
[43:20] eternal no cuz there's no such thing all
[43:23] right but you know what we used to SAR
[43:26] about it that's right we thought that
[43:29] was what we needed to
[43:31] confess right that's right well I'm I'm
[43:35] just I'm saying you want me to I'm
[43:37] saying what the Bible
[43:40] says God in three persons Blessed
[43:44] Trinity that's not a Bible
[43:47] confession so it must be from somewhere
[43:49] else right am but yet we did do those
[43:52] things
[43:55] right
[43:57] now is it right then what did the
[44:00] prophet
[44:03] say when we read the little quote we
[44:06] won't ask him to do that we're going to
[44:07] jump over about number six but I'll
[44:10] quote a little bit from some of it
[44:13] Hebrews chapter
[44:15] 4 brother randam says hold fight to your
[44:18] confession he said hold
[44:22] fast that don't mean
[44:26] just keep
[44:29] testifying that's what we thought it
[44:33] was right that's right we thought it's
[44:36] just us keep testifying and somewhere
[44:39] down the road God might bring it to
[44:43] F you're not saying what God says God
[44:46] said it's already come to
[44:48] pass see when we get to that reality
[44:50] we're getting to something all right but
[44:52] I'm quoting brother
[44:54] r
[44:57] he said whole F that don't mean just
[45:03] testifying if you don't live the life
[45:05] like pulling it
[45:10] up you don't hold it
[45:13] fast so now he's talking about living
[45:16] the life dealing with holding fast your
[45:18] profession or
[45:23] confession you don't hold it I what does
[45:26] he say you're
[45:28] doing you're living a hypocritical
[45:31] thing all right you better just be on
[45:34] out and just forget it and be a sinner
[45:36] right don't profess a Christian live
[45:40] something else you're the biggest
[45:42] stumbling block the world has ever
[45:45] had so now you know brother randam is
[45:48] not saying don't keep confessing or
[45:52] don't keep on
[45:54] testifying now you know know he's not
[45:56] saying
[45:57] that well brother R I got where he said
[46:00] he said let not testify so I not testify
[46:02] no
[46:03] more
[46:05] uh you know better than
[46:08] that his emphasis is
[46:11] what the life we live shows more than
[46:16] the words we
[46:18] blabber right
[46:20] right I can't hear your words because of
[46:24] your life right all
[46:27] right so then we went on to talk
[46:31] about in Romans where it says for us to
[46:35] what believe in our
[46:38] heart confess with our mouth believe in
[46:42] your heart won't save
[46:45] you right now I'm that's your Bible so
[46:50] it's believe in your heart confess with
[46:51] your mouth God if you won't make a
[46:54] confession and it's sure you you don't
[46:56] have it in your heart you don't have a
[46:59] possession if you're not willing to
[47:01] testify of
[47:03] it but what did he
[47:05] say he cannot save you the Church of the
[47:09] Living God 51 he cannot save you by the
[47:13] merits of your prayer
[47:17] right
[47:18] okay he cannot save you by the merits of
[47:21] your
[47:23] enthusiasm or good works amen he saves
[47:27] you by the merits of your faith in your
[47:31] confession if you will confess man then
[47:34] I'll confess you all right
[47:38] first a
[47:39] believing then a confessing that's the
[47:42] Bible now so we'll go through as we're
[47:44] reading it this afternoon we'll be
[47:46] bringing these things to think
[47:50] about truly believing
[47:54] it it being in real
[47:57] faith and then confessing it all right
[48:02] if you take away either one of them
[48:04] where you at that's
[48:05] right now we're going to have to think a
[48:09] little bit very simple thought but
[48:12] you're going to have to think what's
[48:13] being said all right we left off on this
[48:17] quote this morning
[48:19] right so go ahead to number seven and
[48:23] we'll pick
[48:24] up
[48:26] except God's
[48:28] Gift listen close you'll never live
[48:32] above you this is the quote we read at
[48:33] the end this morning you'll never live
[48:36] above your
[48:37] confession Jesus is the high priest of
[48:40] our
[48:41] confession now get in your mind what I'm
[48:43] talking about if he's the high priest
[48:47] what you say definitely has a lot to do
[48:50] with it
[48:54] sure if you say he's a trinity he can't
[48:57] say
[48:59] that now remember to confess is what
[49:02] somebody else
[49:03] says now well I'm just saying what he
[49:09] said but see he wants you to
[49:12] speak from your own
[49:15] Heart Reading as I said Romans
[49:20] 8 that had been read so much in the
[49:22] Baptist Church I got where I didn't want
[49:24] to read that
[49:26] scripture cuz
[49:28] everybody believed in their heart and
[49:31] confessed it with their
[49:35] mouth but why was it they wasn't
[49:40] saved now you got God's word y That's
[49:44] right then may I quote brother R he said
[49:47] if you can find the promise in God's
[49:48] word he said you can call him on the
[49:50] scene listen paraphrase it but very
[49:52] close he said if he don't bring it to
[49:54] pass you can call him liar right do you
[49:57] need that
[50:00] quote that's very close isn't
[50:03] it can't you see people standing before
[50:06] him one
[50:07] day does it not say that they'll come
[50:09] and say have not even cast out devils
[50:12] and things in thy name what did he say
[50:15] depart from me I never knew
[50:19] you see it's very vital then what we
[50:23] confess amen that's right
[50:26] right if I don't get nothing else you
[50:28] get what I'm talking about you look at
[50:31] the preachers of this message and what
[50:33] they're saying God told them they
[50:35] brother around and
[50:38] said you got your two Souls your two
[50:41] Lords your perus your son of mans you
[50:43] got your your no Holy Ghost doctrines
[50:45] you got uh River Jordans you got all
[50:49] kind of
[50:52] doctrines and each one says God told
[50:54] them that
[50:56] sure you remember I told a brother from
[50:59] Florida that time I said why did them
[51:01] two brothers split they both sat the
[51:03] same
[51:05] thing and I explained what both of them
[51:08] said and he said it's right they both
[51:10] said the same thing and they split the
[51:14] churches split most of this
[51:21] message now which one's right which
[51:23] one's
[51:24] wrong
[51:30] well all right if you don't get the idea
[51:32] you're in bad
[51:36] shape cuz what did he say you'll never
[51:40] live above your confession Jesus is the
[51:42] high priest of our confession is that
[51:44] right now any scholar knows that same
[51:47] word profession is confession to same
[51:53] translated now sitting at the right hand
[51:55] of to the father to make intercessions
[51:58] upon
[52:00] what our
[52:04] confession he can't do nothing for you
[52:09] until you first
[52:12] confess he's done it
[52:17] amen and what is he going to
[52:20] say I'm not saved tonight because I got
[52:22] happy and
[52:23] Shout that is it listen to this one I'm
[52:27] not saved because the gift of God works
[52:29] through
[52:33] me I'm saved because I've met the
[52:37] conditions that Jesus Christ required
[52:40] from me I'm saved according to the
[52:44] Bible and it's not because I feel like
[52:47] I'm saved Satan can whip you and stomp
[52:51] you on your feelings but he can't when
[52:54] it's thus sayeth the Lord
[52:56] well where we going well we don't we
[52:58] don't have thus sayth the Lord only
[52:59] prophets got thus sayth the
[53:02] Lord this right here is thus sayeth the
[53:05] Lord what I read from or quoted read
[53:08] when we started from Romans it says
[53:12] confess with your mouth and believe in
[53:14] your heart you know you shall be saved
[53:17] that's th sayth the
[53:19] Lord but do you believe it that
[53:24] way
[53:25] right do you believe that's thus sayith
[53:28] the lord well see then what's he
[53:32] saying he ain't saying we all got to be
[53:35] prophets and have thus sayith the
[53:37] Lord what is thus sayith the Lord anyway
[53:40] you ever thought about it it's what the
[53:42] Lord says to
[53:44] somebody
[53:45] right it's not what somebody says right
[53:49] is What God Says through somebody is
[53:52] thus sayith the Lord the entire Bible is
[53:54] thus sayith the Lord
[53:55] amen right we just got to get it in the
[53:58] right place okay but what does he say
[54:02] I'm saved because I met the condition
[54:06] that Jesus Christ required from me what
[54:08] does he
[54:09] say he said you must be born again
[54:12] there's a requirement right Paul says
[54:15] what you believe in your heart confess
[54:18] with your
[54:19] mouth you shall be saved H there's your
[54:23] requirements repent everyone and be
[54:24] baptized the name of Jesus Christ for
[54:26] the remission of sins and you shall
[54:27] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[54:29] called it
[54:30] so now you've come to face god with thus
[54:32] sayth the
[54:35] Lord now come on don't you think that
[54:39] when brother randam said what I was
[54:41] quoting a moment ago that if you can
[54:43] bring any promise from God's word to God
[54:47] if you don't bring it to pis he said you
[54:48] can call him a liar now he ain't talking
[54:51] about bringing our ideas to God
[54:55] he ain't coming talking about what we
[54:58] think the second person orders intercede
[55:01] for the first person or the third person
[55:04] could come make it
[55:07] happen no that's not God's
[55:09] confession the main thing to confess is
[55:12] one thing he has already done it right
[55:17] as far as he is concerned this world is
[55:20] already over and he's he's building us a
[55:22] future home that's right right
[55:25] amen that's right
[55:27] okay so then we need to think about
[55:31] it look what he goes on to say now we'll
[55:34] read some let me get a cough drop to get
[55:37] this throat cleared up I was hoping for
[55:40] 3 or 4 weeks without preaching would do
[55:43] it but you know that don't always work
[55:47] but listen go ahead on
[55:50] number8 and let's talk about
[55:53] something remember our whole
[55:57] thoughts that God I started to title it
[56:00] that way I started to say God can't do
[56:06] nothing cuz he can't till somebody
[56:08] confesses it
[56:10] right see the scripture said he's the
[56:12] high priest of our confession now not
[56:15] the high priest of your
[56:16] feeling the high priest of your
[56:18] confession the Hebrews 3 says he's the
[56:22] high priest of our confession so we got
[56:23] the scholars the Greet come down to
[56:25] confess and possess as the sign now he's
[56:28] sitting at the right hand of God to make
[56:31] intercession upon your confession so
[56:33] he's very
[56:37] busy remember whatever you can confess
[56:40] him to be that is what he is and if it's
[56:43] not you're not saying what he says right
[56:46] right confess is to say what the same
[56:49] thing that's right all right see make
[56:53] intercession upon your confession he
[56:55] can't do nothing to you or for you until
[56:59] you accept what he has already done and
[57:03] confess
[57:05] it confess
[57:07] it now you said but but but but you you
[57:12] just bring up things that just confuses
[57:16] me sorry honey I didn't confuse
[57:20] you you was Bor than confused I just
[57:23] exposed your confus
[57:26] right so just think about it then all
[57:30] right but listen go on to number nine
[57:32] which is Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[57:35] today and
[57:37] forever look he's a high
[57:40] priest of our confession therefore he
[57:43] can't do nothing for us until first we
[57:47] confess that he has done
[57:51] it it's not confessing he will
[57:56] the confessing he has done it is present
[57:59] tense not past that's what we think we
[58:03] think it's p sure it's over but it's
[58:06] when you can
[58:08] say the way he says
[58:12] it then it's done right there he goes to
[58:17] work
[58:18] watch can't you just see him I know I
[58:22] know I'm carnal I'm sorry can't you just
[58:24] see Jes Jesus sitting there that ain't
[58:26] no talking about no lifeless body but
[58:29] Jesus is sitting there I'm trying to
[58:30] make an illustration he's sitting
[58:34] there and about that time Al Canard says
[58:38] by Stripes I'm
[58:44] heal I'm the high priest of
[58:47] that and you know what if he believes it
[58:49] it's got to
[58:53] happen right
[58:55] right you don't think like that you
[58:57] think it's all over and he's up there
[58:58] playing bingo or rolling bowling balls
[59:02] and that's why the the thunder goes in
[59:04] the air you know we we don't believe in
[59:06] Zeus and and Thor is the old bowling
[59:08] ball now we believe Jesus is up
[59:10] there oh
[59:12] great my point is to get us to look at
[59:15] one thing God's not back there he's not
[59:18] over there he's right here now amen amen
[59:21] that's
[59:22] right that's right making
[59:25] intercession Upon Our
[59:28] confession then he goes to work when you
[59:31] say it making good what we profess that
[59:35] he has done what and he will make good
[59:40] anything that he
[59:42] included in his
[59:44] atonement right so now listen we don't
[59:48] need to try to think about things that
[59:49] ain't in atonement
[59:53] okay
[59:57] right what are we supposed to come to
[1:00:00] not we will
[1:00:02] be or ought to have been but we were
[1:00:07] past tense already
[1:00:09] healed God did it back there in Calvary
[1:00:13] and the only thing we do is reach up and
[1:00:17] receive it by faith and believe it
[1:00:20] confess
[1:00:23] it and you're going to see all of these
[1:00:25] quotes is going to have that little word
[1:00:30] confessing and
[1:00:32] remember confession is to
[1:00:35] say the same thing but it's to say what
[1:00:38] somebody else
[1:00:41] said that somebody else is God
[1:00:45] Almighty and he's
[1:00:49] already taking care of it he just wants
[1:00:53] us to believe it
[1:00:56] right go ahead to number
[1:00:58] 10 as I was with
[1:01:01] Moses
[1:01:03] 1951 and I tell you he was out there and
[1:01:07] would heal any of you that would confess
[1:01:11] him to be your healer remember it can
[1:01:14] never do nothing for you until first you
[1:01:16] say he's done it believe it and accept
[1:01:20] it and testify of it do you know that
[1:01:23] he's the high priest of our
[1:01:25] what confession Hebrews 3:1 and he's
[1:01:28] sitting at the right hand of the father
[1:01:30] to make intercession Upon Our confession
[1:01:33] see we've got to believe it accept it
[1:01:37] and confess
[1:01:43] it you see if we don't say what he
[1:01:49] says then he doesn't have to back it
[1:01:53] up
[1:01:55] but see we try to get off onto the la la
[1:01:57] lands of our
[1:01:59] thoughts you remember the other day when
[1:02:01] we were bringing out
[1:02:03] that the
[1:02:05] disciples found a
[1:02:07] man doing
[1:02:10] Miracles there was not one of
[1:02:14] them and they told Jesus should we go
[1:02:17] stop
[1:02:21] him and he said no said because if right
[1:02:27] if he's not against us he's for us in
[1:02:30] other words I'm conscious of knowing
[1:02:31] what he's
[1:02:34] doing remember our
[1:02:37] point that he gave the
[1:02:43] disciples through the anointing to cast
[1:02:45] out Devils heal the sick raise the
[1:02:48] dead and you remember the
[1:02:51] 70 that walked away from him
[1:02:55] was the ones he was talking to when he
[1:02:58] said remember your names are written in
[1:03:00] heaven and the both that seven he walked
[1:03:03] away there was a lot of people back
[1:03:05] there had some things going
[1:03:07] on are you
[1:03:11] listening there's a lot of people today
[1:03:13] got things going on because if you can
[1:03:15] believe what God
[1:03:19] says and accept
[1:03:23] it
[1:03:27] remember the Bible says if you
[1:03:30] say not if you pray if you say to this
[1:03:36] mountain don't doubt in your
[1:03:39] heart remember the original thoughts
[1:03:41] brother randam had on that that he
[1:03:44] couldn't explain it Y and he said I'm
[1:03:47] going to just say that that was before
[1:03:50] the
[1:03:53] atonement but then it struck
[1:03:55] him in matter words before the atonement
[1:03:58] after the atonement what it was is what
[1:04:00] God
[1:04:02] Said but can we believe it oh that was
[1:04:04] for brother brandham like a big man in
[1:04:07] this message he said the third pull was
[1:04:10] for Jesus Christ and brother
[1:04:13] brandom and not for you and
[1:04:17] I if I called his name you'd be amazed
[1:04:20] but I heard him say it or wouldn't say
[1:04:23] it
[1:04:25] well I come to find out the prophet said
[1:04:28] one day that the third pull was for the
[1:04:32] bride and the
[1:04:34] church and two the totally
[1:04:39] lost so you know who I want to believe
[1:04:43] okay now think about
[1:04:46] it he cannot do nothing for
[1:04:51] us until
[1:04:55] we believe it go ahead to number 11
[1:04:58] expectations
[1:05:07] 61 he's a high
[1:05:10] priest to make intercession Upon Our
[1:05:13] confession and cannot do nothing for us
[1:05:16] until first we accept it and confess
[1:05:19] it now we could get down at the altar
[1:05:22] and pray till we
[1:05:25] were now listen to
[1:05:27] him till we laid on our faces and
[1:05:31] died until we believe and accept his
[1:05:34] pardoning grace we're still lost that's
[1:05:38] right no matter how loud we could scream
[1:05:41] how long we could stay or how much we
[1:05:44] could do without food until in our heart
[1:05:48] the
[1:05:49] revelation God gives us that Jesus
[1:05:52] Christ died to save us and we accept it
[1:05:56] as our own personal property it's
[1:05:58] something Christ did for me did for you
[1:06:02] and to whosoever will believe it then
[1:06:04] you're saved because you have believed
[1:06:06] it and you healed the same way all right
[1:06:11] it don't make no difference what we
[1:06:15] do until we believe it and accept it the
[1:06:19] pardoning grace is no
[1:06:21] good and we know for a certainty then
[1:06:24] we've got to confess it we don't have no
[1:06:26] problem or shouldn't have with that
[1:06:27] Jehovah Gyra number
[1:06:30] 12 now if the Holy Spirit was taken out
[1:06:34] of which was taken out of Christ
[1:06:38] Jesus where his Corporal body sitting at
[1:06:40] the right hand of God making
[1:06:42] intercession for on our confession do
[1:06:45] you believe
[1:06:46] that he cannot do one thing for us until
[1:06:50] we confess it now watch you said Brother
[1:06:53] David you said he was sitting there with
[1:06:55] him I you better remember I had these
[1:06:58] notes reading them last night so you
[1:07:00] ought to pay attention when I make a
[1:07:01] statement you ought to pay attention
[1:07:03] he's going to bring that out in a minute
[1:07:04] and let brother R say it you remember
[1:07:06] what I said a while ago he's sitting
[1:07:08] there
[1:07:11] waiting then when you confess it come on
[1:07:15] he cannot do one thing for us until we
[1:07:17] confess it and then he
[1:07:20] works and he making intercession on our
[1:07:23] confession
[1:07:25] he goes to work on that that's
[1:07:28] right making your confession you're
[1:07:31] going to find out how important your
[1:07:32] confession is look at the next one
[1:07:34] expectation and Leadership of leadings
[1:07:37] of the
[1:07:38] spirit is corporal body sits on the
[1:07:41] throne of God for a bleeding sacrifice
[1:07:44] Before the Throne of his majesty to make
[1:07:46] intercessions Upon Our
[1:07:50] confession he cannot help us until we we
[1:07:54] confess it first for he's the high
[1:07:57] priest of our
[1:08:00] confession now
[1:08:01] remember the job of a high
[1:08:07] priest the job of a high priest was not
[1:08:10] necessarily to raise a
[1:08:14] lamb he probably never bathed one
[1:08:18] probably
[1:08:19] never fed
[1:08:22] one I'm just make a point
[1:08:25] okay but one
[1:08:28] day he took that
[1:08:30] lamb and made an
[1:08:33] atonement nobody else couldn't do it
[1:08:36] that's
[1:08:37] right and why couldn't anybody else is
[1:08:40] sincere well I'm sincere God knows my
[1:08:42] heart I'll just offer my own
[1:08:48] offering and that wouldn't work I don't
[1:08:51] care how sincere I grate you thank you
[1:08:53] you are that wouldn't
[1:08:56] work
[1:08:57] right you could get killed out way very
[1:09:01] easily
[1:09:03] right see he's the high
[1:09:06] priest of our
[1:09:09] confession go ahead number
[1:09:12] 14 sir as we would see
[1:09:17] Jesus now the word confess there is the
[1:09:20] the same word ministers would know it
[1:09:23] profess
[1:09:24] it says profess and confess is the same
[1:09:27] word to profess it is
[1:09:30] done to profess it was done confess it
[1:09:35] it come from the same Greek word and we
[1:09:39] know that we must confess that he has
[1:09:41] done it and he cannot do it until we
[1:09:44] confess it then he's the high priest to
[1:09:48] makeing recessions upon what we confess
[1:09:51] that he has done for us
[1:09:54] that makes a faith in a finished work
[1:09:58] that Christ did for us at Calvary
[1:10:01] right makes it to a
[1:10:05] point
[1:10:08] confess go ahead calling Jesus on the
[1:10:10] scene
[1:10:12] 15 Hebrews says there confess high
[1:10:16] priest of our
[1:10:17] confession therefore he cannot do
[1:10:21] anything until first we could confess
[1:10:24] that he has done it that's right and
[1:10:27] then when we confess it then he is the
[1:10:30] high priest imediator to go to work on
[1:10:33] that and make it
[1:10:36] right so we pray trusting in God tonight
[1:10:40] in his kindness and mercy that he will
[1:10:42] give us his abundance of
[1:10:44] Grace remember you must accept it must
[1:10:48] accept it and confess
[1:10:52] it
[1:10:54] can I just read a few without if they
[1:10:56] get them up fast enough I want to read
[1:10:59] this go to number 15 16 I want to read
[1:11:01] this
[1:11:03] one this is second we would you see
[1:11:07] Jesus every sin in the
[1:11:09] world was forgiven when Christ died at
[1:11:14] Calvary
[1:11:18] okay but what's that got to do with
[1:11:21] you right
[1:11:27] what do you
[1:11:29] mean well he all he wants you to do is
[1:11:32] believe in your heart and confess with
[1:11:34] your mouth right that's all he's ask us
[1:11:38] to do there's a blood atonement on the
[1:11:41] Altar for the sins of the world but
[1:11:43] it'll never do you any good until you
[1:11:46] accept it and confess it he can never
[1:11:49] work on it until first you say and have
[1:11:53] by faith Faith accepted it they need a
[1:11:56] high priest to make intercessions Upon
[1:11:58] Our
[1:11:59] confession see he can't move he's
[1:12:07] bound there's nothing he can do until
[1:12:10] first you accept it and confess it and
[1:12:13] from your heart you believe it then it
[1:12:16] touches him then he can go to work on it
[1:12:20] and make intercession for
[1:12:22] you yep so think about
[1:12:26] it God is bound to the point that he
[1:12:30] cannot do anything until somebody
[1:12:31] confesses
[1:12:34] it you got to believe
[1:12:37] it and confess
[1:12:40] it if not he can't make it come to Pi
[1:12:43] cuz remember the point now if you get
[1:12:44] nothing listen if he's the high priest
[1:12:48] of our
[1:12:52] confession now listen listen the high
[1:12:55] priest didn't now you got to get the
[1:12:57] whole story so listen the high priest
[1:13:00] didn't make an offering just for himself
[1:13:02] he made your
[1:13:05] offering sure we know it was for
[1:13:07] everybody for him and everything but
[1:13:12] remember he walked behind
[1:13:15] there and if he'd have been sin in his
[1:13:19] life he would have
[1:13:21] died so remember he must have got took
[1:13:24] care of before he went back there that's
[1:13:26] right is that all right with
[1:13:28] everybody see that way he could car it
[1:13:31] for me and
[1:13:32] you so it's my confession that he's
[1:13:38] taking we know for certain God don't
[1:13:41] need no
[1:13:44] confession so he's taking what we
[1:13:49] say however we confess it that's the way
[1:13:53] it is
[1:13:54] you see why I fight so hard the
[1:13:56] doctrinal issues of the
[1:13:58] message because if that's not saying
[1:14:00] what brother around said then we don't
[1:14:02] need to be saying it
[1:14:06] right right there's a Bible full of
[1:14:12] truth
[1:14:13] right why do we need so many doctrines
[1:14:16] and
[1:14:17] ideas well you got well come on I've
[1:14:20] left it
[1:14:21] open I'm for internet right now come on
[1:14:25] show me where I've ever taught anything
[1:14:26] outside of this
[1:14:28] message show me where I've taught
[1:14:30] anything contrary to this
[1:14:33] message now you show me preacher to tell
[1:14:35] you that and I'll go with
[1:14:38] you did you see what I said I said you
[1:14:42] tell me who they are and I'll go with
[1:14:46] you and we'll see whether it's right or
[1:14:48] not well let just be if that's sarcasm
[1:14:51] I'd sure love to have a lot of it right
[1:14:55] I thought we supposed to believe a
[1:14:57] prophet I thought he said that he'd be
[1:15:00] glad to see a day when people would
[1:15:02] stand up and say you are not saying what
[1:15:05] Paul said that's right of course you're
[1:15:08] not popular when you do
[1:15:11] that oh that's just your
[1:15:16] opinion but see he cannot do anything
[1:15:19] that's right until we believe it and
[1:15:24] confess it and then he goes to
[1:15:27] work upon what you have need
[1:15:30] of you have need of Salvation he goes to
[1:15:34] work on it
[1:15:37] amen right you remember what we were
[1:15:40] bringing out this
[1:15:42] morning we're down to it let's read
[1:15:44] number 17 cuz that's where we stopped
[1:15:46] this morning and picked it up look what
[1:15:48] he says at Thy word Lord I'll let down
[1:15:51] the net
[1:15:53] God cannot save
[1:15:56] you excuse me God can only save you as
[1:15:59] you testify he can only heal you as you
[1:16:02] testify he is sitting at the right hand
[1:16:04] of the father tonight in heaven making
[1:16:07] intercession upon your
[1:16:09] profession it isn't how loud you cry how
[1:16:11] hard you beat the altar how many Good
[1:16:13] Deeds you do it's your faith that saves
[1:16:16] you and if you confess it with your lips
[1:16:19] and coming from your heart and not just
[1:16:22] say it with your lips I believe it
[1:16:24] coming from your inner being your
[1:16:27] soul watch what he said he goes to
[1:16:31] work as a high
[1:16:34] priest what's he
[1:16:36] doing he's going before God and he's
[1:16:41] saying you
[1:16:43] know Richard Marlo is down on Earth and
[1:16:47] he's saying
[1:16:49] that I'm the same yesterday today and
[1:16:52] forever
[1:16:54] right he said you mean and you know
[1:16:57] where we're going okay I'll give you the
[1:17:00] last
[1:17:01] quote
[1:17:06] okay God is waiting on you and
[1:17:09] I adoption
[1:17:12] time so now you see what I'm getting to
[1:17:14] don't you but if it's not right on the
[1:17:17] regular New Birth then adoption time
[1:17:19] won't work either all got to be one
[1:17:21] thing right listen
[1:17:23] he goes to work as a high priest sit at
[1:17:25] the right hand of the father to make
[1:17:27] intercessions upon your confession
[1:17:29] Hebrews 3:1 he cannot do one thing for
[1:17:32] you until first you believe it and
[1:17:34] accept it and then confess it to be
[1:17:37] so and the people today they'll go out
[1:17:40] say well I felt better last night but
[1:17:43] today I'm not I'm but today I'm so bad I
[1:17:46] just can't hardly stand it that's just
[1:17:49] exactly where you lose your
[1:17:51] confession and drop right
[1:17:55] down that's why you can be healed today
[1:17:59] be sick tomorrow with the same thing
[1:18:01] okay now watch him look where he carries
[1:18:03] it on too but carry it right
[1:18:07] now no matter who you are how saintly
[1:18:11] how Godly you are your minister
[1:18:14] clergyman or your Deacon or whatever you
[1:18:16] are are you've been a Christian for 50
[1:18:19] years and watch it if you go out of here
[1:18:23] tomorrow and lose
[1:18:26] faith that you're a Christian and start
[1:18:29] to telling people you're not a Christian
[1:18:33] anymore you're
[1:18:36] backslid now there's where we ended this
[1:18:38] morning I believe that a Christian can
[1:18:43] backslide but that don't mean you're
[1:18:46] lost cuz that's what he's just bringing
[1:18:49] you he didn't tell you you was lost he
[1:18:52] said you backl
[1:18:54] now if you come to
[1:18:55] justification you can lose your
[1:18:57] confession you come to
[1:19:00] sanctification you can lose your
[1:19:02] confession but if you come to the New
[1:19:04] Birth you can't lose that but you can
[1:19:09] backslide well I don't believe Christian
[1:19:11] well then okay that's your opinion I do
[1:19:14] because that way I can keep things
[1:19:15] straight amen I can keep the man that
[1:19:18] the prophet referred to him this morning
[1:19:20] in the Hebrew Book that was a preacher
[1:19:24] he went out and got him some beer and
[1:19:25] got drunk and things and all
[1:19:27] that he took him off scene brother
[1:19:30] Brandon said God had to take his child
[1:19:33] home so now you argue with him about
[1:19:36] whether you backslide or
[1:19:38] not right I ain't looked up the quotes
[1:19:41] to see what all of it is I just know
[1:19:43] that statement is
[1:19:45] right but if you're just Justified you
[1:19:47] can lose everything you're just
[1:19:50] Sanctified you can lose everything when
[1:19:51] you lose your confession
[1:19:54] but if you're truly born again you can't
[1:19:56] lose your eternal life that's my
[1:20:01] confession because I can't see having
[1:20:03] eternal life and losing you mean God
[1:20:06] give you eternal life he going to take
[1:20:07] it back he going to give it to you again
[1:20:08] he going to take it back he going to
[1:20:09] give it to you that's a good Methodist
[1:20:12] that's a good Methodist Doctrine if you
[1:20:14] die when you're Sanctified everything's
[1:20:16] all
[1:20:17] right I'm making no
[1:20:20] light watch what he goes WR say now I
[1:20:24] thought I'd skip it but it's all right
[1:20:26] I'm sorry look at number 18 which is off
[1:20:29] the message Jehovah Gyra no matter how
[1:20:32] much you pray how much you cry how much
[1:20:35] you agonize how much you do it'll never
[1:20:39] be accepted that's
[1:20:42] right well brother Dale you're taking
[1:20:45] away
[1:20:47] everything that I thought was the reason
[1:20:49] I got
[1:20:51] saved
[1:20:56] God can do nothing for
[1:20:58] you until first by faith you accept it
[1:21:03] and believe it and confess it watch
[1:21:06] that's the only way God can act now is
[1:21:10] when you act
[1:21:14] first you like that one amen when you
[1:21:16] act first all in our life right cuz he's
[1:21:19] a high priest making intercession on
[1:21:22] your confession of your faith in his
[1:21:26] finished work I don't believe there's
[1:21:28] anyone could find fault with
[1:21:30] that I like that one he said I don't
[1:21:34] believe I can find anybody what all you
[1:21:37] got to do is believe it confess
[1:21:40] it saying that it's already done
[1:21:45] 19 the queen of Shiva no matter how much
[1:21:49] you pray Let's see we read other St no
[1:21:51] excuse me okay he can't do nothing for
[1:21:53] us read up all up and down he's a high
[1:21:56] priest sitting at the right hand of a
[1:21:58] mighty God making recession Upon Our
[1:22:00] confession our profession it's the same
[1:22:02] word now he can't do nothing for us
[1:22:04] until we already
[1:22:06] say that he's done
[1:22:09] it
[1:22:11] right we have to Pro
[1:22:14] confess it or profess it that he's done
[1:22:18] it then he can go to work on it and make
[1:22:22] the the intercession now can I stop
[1:22:24] there and
[1:22:25] just preach a
[1:22:29] while you realize what he just
[1:22:33] said just that one quote that one
[1:22:35] statement you realize what he
[1:22:40] said that God cannot do
[1:22:42] anything
[1:22:44] until you first believe it except it's
[1:22:48] for
[1:22:49] you and confess that it's already
[1:22:56] done
[1:22:59] right now may I ask it in this
[1:23:04] way cuz I got to bring that to bring
[1:23:07] this when a high priest makes an
[1:23:13] offering and we're talking about the Old
[1:23:15] Testament forms right everybody with me
[1:23:17] yes the Old Testament when the high
[1:23:20] priest made the atonement
[1:23:23] it was for the P
[1:23:25] sins amen that's right there's no Old
[1:23:32] Testament in any way that talks
[1:23:38] about it being right
[1:23:40] there it's pointing out Point remember
[1:23:44] everything the Old Testament pointed to
[1:23:46] Jesus Christ amen that's right right
[1:23:49] nothing there was present tense other
[1:23:51] for that time
[1:23:53] when they made the atonement it wiped
[1:23:55] away the past year never done nothing to
[1:23:58] the Future
[1:24:01] right brother Bron says when you come
[1:24:04] see future home oh he said justification
[1:24:07] just chops off your P sins he says does
[1:24:11] nothing to your
[1:24:14] future now I hope you're going to
[1:24:16] swaller and listen does nothing to your
[1:24:19] future sanctification is cleansing
[1:24:21] setting aside does nothing to your
[1:24:24] future the new birth cleanses all of
[1:24:27] that out and puts eternal life living in
[1:24:31] you now may I say it in my words then
[1:24:34] there is no
[1:24:36] future don't worry about your sin
[1:24:38] there's no
[1:24:41] future what do you mean just what I say
[1:24:44] it when you receive eternal life there's
[1:24:47] no pist right in the SE forgetfulness we
[1:24:51] agree with that but there's no no future
[1:24:53] everything's
[1:24:54] present that's
[1:24:57] right when you receive eternal life
[1:25:00] you're just as Eternal as you'll ever be
[1:25:04] agree that he not trying to make a
[1:25:06] future
[1:25:08] right it's good us to believe where
[1:25:10] we're at right now
[1:25:13] amen were you following me you go
[1:25:17] back cover what I've been talking
[1:25:21] about
[1:25:24] God cannot do anything for
[1:25:26] you until you first confess it
[1:25:30] right well he done it back
[1:25:41] under what let me ask you a question
[1:25:43] what good is a god of
[1:25:48] yesterday what good is a god of tomorrow
[1:25:53] if there's no God of
[1:26:00] today do you understand what I'm getting
[1:26:03] at I'm trying to get us to think about
[1:26:05] what kind of confession we need to be
[1:26:07] making that's
[1:26:09] it
[1:26:11] right we need to get away from the past
[1:26:15] right ain't nothing you can do about it
[1:26:17] right it's done finished y get away from
[1:26:21] future
[1:26:24] CU we ain't there yet that's right right
[1:26:28] get down right
[1:26:32] now amen we are definitely not talking
[1:26:35] about
[1:26:38] Catholicism that you pay so much money
[1:26:40] and you do certain thing and they'll
[1:26:42] forgive you of what you're going to do
[1:26:45] there's no such
[1:26:48] thing right right he's not going to
[1:26:52] forgive you or something you
[1:26:54] do salvation when you receive it does
[1:26:58] not set you in a category that you
[1:27:00] cannot never
[1:27:04] sin that's why it's so
[1:27:07] careful for us to think Catholicism puts
[1:27:11] it to work well bless God I ain't got to
[1:27:13] worry about
[1:27:15] it I'm born again I can't go to
[1:27:18] hell what kind of confession is god
[1:27:21] making
[1:27:25] remember he's going to
[1:27:27] confess just what you
[1:27:32] say what kind of Salvation do you
[1:27:36] have well it don't make no difference
[1:27:38] where I sin or not I'm a born again
[1:27:42] Christian you know what you're proving
[1:27:44] there you're proving you ain't Born
[1:27:47] Again does that hurt your
[1:27:50] feelings well good
[1:27:54] you can do something about
[1:27:56] it right I'm not trying to be hateful
[1:28:00] I'm trying to save your
[1:28:03] soul you see church he can only confess
[1:28:07] what we say now if you have missed all
[1:28:10] this morning and all this evening
[1:28:12] remember one thing the only confession
[1:28:15] we can make is that he's already done
[1:28:19] it it's a finished product all right but
[1:28:22] his confession is he's already done it
[1:28:26] he's now revealing it to
[1:28:31] you and then he will
[1:28:35] not account
[1:28:37] sin to
[1:28:40] you wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
[1:28:43] wait you you you you you just said that
[1:28:44] one ago but you ain't
[1:28:47] listening blessed is the man to whom God
[1:28:50] will
[1:28:51] what not impute
[1:28:54] sin now may I quote brother
[1:28:58] brandham see we think oh it's us we're
[1:29:01] so good it don't matter what I done he
[1:29:05] won't impute it now may I quote brother
[1:29:09] R how many of you remember what he
[1:29:14] said said he won't impute
[1:29:17] sin he said there is a man of that
[1:29:20] person
[1:29:22] now you're going to automatically say
[1:29:23] Jesus Christ don't hold on to that
[1:29:25] that's
[1:29:29] fine but here's what he
[1:29:31] said he said he cannot impute
[1:29:35] sin over the
[1:29:41] token you know what the word I didn't
[1:29:43] know I was going this way but you want
[1:29:47] to
[1:29:48] quote he can't impute sin over the token
[1:29:53] that's right you mean that gives me a
[1:29:55] right to live like the
[1:29:57] devil no because when you're saying that
[1:30:00] you automatically met and you don't know
[1:30:01] where you're
[1:30:02] at you know what I'm more concerned with
[1:30:06] my life
[1:30:09] today than I
[1:30:11] was 50 years ago when I received the
[1:30:14] Holy
[1:30:16] Ghost right at 5040
[1:30:20] something
[1:30:23] you know
[1:30:25] why because if my savior thought enough
[1:30:29] to die in my place to save
[1:30:33] me why would I ever think about what I
[1:30:36] could get by
[1:30:39] with how dare that thought enter the
[1:30:42] mind of a Christian to think you can get
[1:30:44] by with
[1:30:46] anything but remember he won't impute it
[1:30:48] over the token what is the token the the
[1:30:51] baptism of the Holy
[1:30:53] Ghost is that
[1:30:57] right but you see it's so important for
[1:30:59] us
[1:31:00] to say the right
[1:31:03] thing well brother Dale I just I believe
[1:31:06] that that God and three persons is what
[1:31:08] it
[1:31:09] is
[1:31:13] well God can't confess
[1:31:16] that so he didn't make intercession
[1:31:20] right
[1:31:23] right he only makes intercession when
[1:31:26] the truth is spoken
[1:31:29] amen maybe he's not as busy as we think
[1:31:32] you remember that while ago I was trying
[1:31:34] to illustrate how busy he is listen to
[1:31:36] all the prayers maybe he's not as busy
[1:31:38] as we
[1:31:39] think maybe he ain't got a lot to
[1:31:45] do because we're not saying it
[1:31:50] right
[1:31:55] you must act
[1:31:58] first before he can do
[1:32:01] anything you must say that he's already
[1:32:04] done
[1:32:08] it for he's the high priest there to
[1:32:11] make intercession Upon Our confession of
[1:32:14] what he has done for
[1:32:19] us so you see before God can do anything
[1:32:22] for
[1:32:25] you you must F you first have to believe
[1:32:30] it and confess it he cannot work cannot
[1:32:34] do one thing I tell you no wonder people
[1:32:39] are scared of Divine
[1:32:43] Healing I say this reverently and
[1:32:46] brotherly but there's so many hoaxes
[1:32:50] that's called Divine Healing and you
[1:32:52] scare the people
[1:32:55] off so is the hoaxes of believing in
[1:33:01] Salvation you cannot ever be
[1:33:04] saved until you believe it accept it and
[1:33:07] confess it that's right okay drop to 24
[1:33:11] we'll read this one we'll try to bring
[1:33:13] it to a close off the message believest
[1:33:16] thou
[1:33:18] this look what he's
[1:33:20] bringing
[1:33:22] he says he's talking about it never say
[1:33:25] nothing else but what I'm Healed from
[1:33:27] now on see we shouldn't say anything
[1:33:31] else come on when I say that then you go
[1:33:34] back well you said this morning yeah I
[1:33:36] said this morning when you go down to
[1:33:38] the doctor's office you don't walk in
[1:33:39] and say there ain't nothing wrong with
[1:33:42] me go and tell him what's
[1:33:45] happening well if I tell him what's
[1:33:47] happened that's going to mean I got it I
[1:33:49] come on folks you already got it
[1:33:55] it ain't going to change from a
[1:33:56] non-malignant cancer to a cancer in the
[1:33:59] doctor's office cuz you don't say
[1:34:02] it you already got
[1:34:06] it walk in and say I'm sick give me
[1:34:10] something then he can give you
[1:34:13] something you go to God and you say God
[1:34:16] there ain't nothing wrong with
[1:34:18] me ain't nothing wrong with me Lord
[1:34:22] now who you lying
[1:34:24] to all right so let's read that settles
[1:34:29] it he can't do nothing for you till you
[1:34:32] first confess it now watch this real
[1:34:35] careful he's the high priest of our
[1:34:39] confession now watch
[1:34:41] it in that case not even to your faith
[1:34:50] right
[1:34:52] now I didn't say that you're going to
[1:34:53] talk to
[1:34:55] him you doubt he said
[1:35:00] it
[1:35:03] see he's the high priest of our
[1:35:06] confession in that case not even to your
[1:35:10] faith well he's a high priest of my
[1:35:13] faith but you won't confess it you
[1:35:16] afraid to say
[1:35:20] it listen folks you're looking at a man
[1:35:23] that you've been with me a long time and
[1:35:25] you've seen God heal me of many
[1:35:28] things from eyesight to blood chain
[1:35:31] types to knees that are supposed to be
[1:35:34] taken from me all forms of things amen
[1:35:38] the way I get my healing is do one thing
[1:35:41] first number one you go ask God is
[1:35:43] anything
[1:35:45] wrong CU remember I quote to brother
[1:35:47] Bram where he says to be healed first
[1:35:49] confess your sin
[1:35:55] right so you ask God is anything
[1:35:59] wrong now listen I serve a God maybe you
[1:36:02] don't but I serve a God that knows
[1:36:07] things when I'm saying before God God
[1:36:10] have I sinned I don't mean have I had a
[1:36:13] wrong thought I don't mean of this or
[1:36:16] that or the other about it I ask him is
[1:36:19] anything against me
[1:36:24] right and then I must say father there's
[1:36:28] nothing against me because if there is
[1:36:31] I've asked you to forgive me and you
[1:36:33] promis you
[1:36:35] would this is the way I get my
[1:36:39] healing and then I just start
[1:36:42] saying by his stripes I'm
[1:36:46] Healed and I don't care what the doctor
[1:36:48] says I don't care what anybody says I'm
[1:36:52] healed amen that's why my confession is
[1:36:54] what when you talk to me how are you
[1:36:57] doing I'm doing
[1:36:59] wonderful I'm not going to confess
[1:37:01] anything
[1:37:03] else I've worked at
[1:37:07] jobs carrying 80 90 to 100 pound of hubs
[1:37:11] to put them on each car one a
[1:37:14] minute with a brace on my
[1:37:18] back and having to eat pain pills
[1:37:21] and things but I never gave

[1:37:29] had a service one time like Friday night
[1:37:31] Saturday night and Sunday night brother
[1:37:33] Mo Pastor I was in the hospital because
[1:37:35] of my back doctor told me he said I'll
[1:37:38] let you go home if you'll promise me
[1:37:41] you'll go home and lay in bed for a week
[1:37:44] or
[1:37:46] two I never gave him my
[1:37:50] word

[1:37:56] word cuz you know what I done I went

[1:38:07] services on Sunday with an ice pack at
[1:38:10] my
[1:38:13] back but you know what God touched me
[1:38:17] and took away the
[1:38:19] pain can Fess your way into your
[1:38:23] healing listen hey I say it as a human
[1:38:27] being even it may not
[1:38:30] be great Supernatural faith that you
[1:38:33] first received when you got that it's
[1:38:35] easy to
[1:38:38] confess but just start confessing
[1:38:42] it somebody comes up like I say we we
[1:38:45] get in here we preach on faith we preach
[1:38:47] on faith you go outside and everybody
[1:38:49] talking about the doctors they're going
[1:38:50] to do that weak or what's wrong with
[1:38:54] them
[1:39:01] right why don't you confess your way
[1:39:03] into your healing right you know you
[1:39:06] might confess it you say yeah but but
[1:39:09] you read to us well brother R said it's
[1:39:11] not not just saying it that's
[1:39:14] right but it is say for us not to say
[1:39:17] it to start confessing it and keep
[1:39:20] confessing it
[1:39:22] the sicker you get by his stps I'm
[1:39:26] Healed one confession going
[1:39:29] up by STS I'm heal to going up you know
[1:39:33] after a
[1:39:37] while I have a funny way of looking at
[1:39:39] things I
[1:39:40] guess ever thought about in the Bible
[1:39:43] where the the guy comes you know I was
[1:39:45] reading it yesterday yesterday
[1:39:49] morning and the guy comes up and knocks
[1:39:51] on the door the guy know said give me
[1:39:53] three loaves of bread cuz I got company
[1:39:55] that's come in I ain't got nothing to
[1:39:56] eat he said get out of here my kid is in
[1:39:59] the bed all let go on said because of
[1:40:02] the ever how you pronounce it in other
[1:40:03] words the constant pounding of the
[1:40:07] man you know what he got up and open the
[1:40:11] door
[1:40:14] right you ever thought about you might
[1:40:16] just worry God so much by saying you're
[1:40:18] healed that he might heal you
[1:40:21] you say you're stupid I agree with you
[1:40:23] but it
[1:40:25] works won't you try
[1:40:29] it instead of saying how sick you are
[1:40:32] say how well you
[1:40:35] are now we know we're under the curse of
[1:40:40] sin but just because you got a bad cold
[1:40:44] is that the devil is after
[1:40:46] you I don't mean it wrong I just life
[1:40:49] about it and I get these points brother
[1:40:51] Mo years ago his trailer was about 20
[1:40:54] something years old and and water pipes
[1:40:56] got the busting on him and he said one
[1:40:59] day he said the devil's after me I said
[1:41:02] no they wore
[1:41:06] out I said he wore
[1:41:09] out I said you can't expect him to
[1:41:12] Li you know I HED him fix some things it
[1:41:15] was wore
[1:41:16] out but why don't we just start saying
[1:41:18] What God Says
[1:41:22] God says I'm
[1:41:25] Healed well I don't want to lie about it
[1:41:28] okay you're already liar so we settle
[1:41:30] that more than one anybody got any
[1:41:34] problem you see because you're not
[1:41:39] thinking if it's true
[1:41:42] that uh Salvation
[1:41:45] means natural or spiritual right the
[1:41:48] word Soo which means physical healing
[1:41:53] our spiritual
[1:41:57] healing then what about your confession
[1:41:59] is your
[1:42:04] salvation come
[1:42:06] on we're always talking about how sick
[1:42:08] we
[1:42:14] are right you know why I'm over on this
[1:42:17] side cuz my leg's
[1:42:19] hurting but I ain't going to give
[1:42:21] up
[1:42:25] okay but is your confession of your
[1:42:27] salvation and your healing the
[1:42:32] same
[1:42:34] o That's itching in
[1:42:39] it would you approach your salvation and
[1:42:41] believe it's on the same basis of your
[1:42:47] healing and every time you walk out the
[1:42:49] door and talk to somebody yourself
[1:42:52] do you go before God every day and say
[1:42:54] God I'm lost God I'm lost God I'm
[1:42:58] lost do
[1:43:01] you
[1:43:05] oh did you get
[1:43:08] it you understand what I just
[1:43:13] said you don't put your healing and your
[1:43:15] salvation in the same basket that's
[1:43:18] right healing is eternal
[1:43:22] salvation is on the basis of I mean
[1:43:25] healing is not Eternal salvation is on
[1:43:27] the basis of Eternal healing is on the
[1:43:30] basis of right sick today right heal to
[1:43:37] tomorrow sick the next day salvation
[1:43:39] doesn't work that way so watch now what
[1:43:42] I'm saying if it's
[1:43:45] true that he can't do nothing for
[1:43:49] us until we we confess it so he can't
[1:43:53] heal us until we confess
[1:43:55] it well then he can't save us till we
[1:43:57] confess
[1:43:59] it well you know what we might be doing
[1:44:01] a lot of backsliding Reason reading that
[1:44:04] quote while ago we might be doing a lot
[1:44:06] of
[1:44:07] backsliding because we're not taking
[1:44:09] What God
[1:44:18] Says listen to what he says
[1:44:27] 24 he can't do nothing for
[1:44:30] you till you first confess
[1:44:34] it he's the high priest of your
[1:44:36] confession in that case not even your
[1:44:43] faith and even couldn't be
[1:44:49] faith until you confess
[1:44:54] it Y come on I thought we believe faith
[1:44:58] is a substance of things hope far the
[1:44:59] evidence of things not
[1:45:04] seen it can't be Faith until we profess
[1:45:07] it or confess
[1:45:12] it and then it's got to be what he's
[1:45:16] saying
[1:45:18] right you got to accept Faith believe it
[1:45:22] and
[1:45:23] confess that it already is
[1:45:26] done for faith is a substance of things
[1:45:29] F far the evidence of Things Not
[1:45:32] Seen he said I thought we say by faith
[1:45:34] and everything so evidently up in
[1:45:38] here he's the high priest of your
[1:45:40] confession in that case not even your
[1:45:42] faith if your faith is not correct
[1:45:45] you're not saved
[1:45:49] right right
[1:45:51] right what's God
[1:45:53] doing waiting on me and
[1:46:00] you adoption
[1:46:02] time waiting on you and
[1:46:05] me what's he waiting on us
[1:46:10] for what's God waiting on you and me
[1:46:19] for you mean he can't fulfill his word
[1:46:23] until we believe
[1:46:25] it
[1:46:27] right it's been the whole day bringing
[1:46:29] that for just a few words so
[1:46:36] listen you
[1:46:38] mean my great super duper
[1:46:43] faith is not
[1:46:47] enough it is if you've got it right if
[1:46:51] you got it you'll confess it but if you
[1:46:53] won't confess it you ain't got it is
[1:46:55] that good terminology yes if you won't
[1:46:58] say it you don't have
[1:47:00] it what if God's waiting on you and I to
[1:47:03] say
[1:47:07] things listen church I've been around 50
[1:47:14] years I got a quote laying at home I'll
[1:47:16] bring it Wednesday Lord willing where
[1:47:18] brother R said God's waiting on one man
[1:47:24] in the world was turned upside down by
[1:47:27] Martin Luther not by Martin Luther and
[1:47:30] his
[1:47:31] cohorts is when Martin Luther said it
[1:47:33] God could make it come to pass I said
[1:47:35] that Wednesday over and
[1:47:38] over John Wesley was a man every Church
[1:47:41] age had one
[1:47:43] Messenger right one Angel that's right
[1:47:46] the angel gets it first and he brings it
[1:47:48] to the people then they they say it
[1:47:51] right we believe that that's
[1:47:53] right but what if God's waiting on you
[1:47:55] to say
[1:47:57] it I thank God for the rain that we've
[1:48:01] received it's really been a help we've
[1:48:03] received a good
[1:48:08] bit what if it's one of these
[1:48:11] children that
[1:48:13] said Lord we need rain
[1:48:18] y but why can't you do like terance at
[1:48:21] least come up here every service and say
[1:48:24] not let's pray for rain let's thank God
[1:48:26] for
[1:48:29] rain
[1:48:31] right that's pretty pretty hard to do
[1:48:34] ain't it thank God for
[1:48:37] rain when it ain't
[1:48:40] raining it ain't been raining in
[1:48:43] much and you say Thank You Lord thank
[1:48:46] you Lord now what is he making
[1:48:49] intercession
[1:48:52] now he don't need
[1:48:55] nobody to remind him it ain't
[1:48:59] rained
[1:49:03] right you know he don't need nobody to
[1:49:05] tell him that
[1:49:08] right but what about somebody just
[1:49:10] saying thank you for rain when it ain't
[1:49:12] even
[1:49:15] raining why don't you do
[1:49:17] that why don't you try it
[1:49:21] right I've Tau you from 30 years ago or
[1:49:26] more and I'm trying to get you to
[1:49:29] believe enough to say
[1:49:34] it I thought as I said this
[1:49:39] morning one big brother said it or did I
[1:49:42] say it today when big brother
[1:49:46] said third pool is for brother brandham
[1:49:49] and the Lord
[1:49:51] Jesus not for us well I read Word a
[1:49:55] prophet said is far that's de see I read
[1:49:58] where the Prophet said is far the bride
[1:50:01] and the
[1:50:03] church and to the totally
[1:50:07] lost see God don't need nobody to
[1:50:10] confess
[1:50:14] negative what if Luther to come out
[1:50:16] praise God I got it do J shall live by
[1:50:19] faith May
[1:50:20] maybe hope so maybe it could
[1:50:24] be he didn't care what anybody else said
[1:50:28] the pope he got
[1:50:30] excommunicated for one little
[1:50:33] statement you know what excommunicating
[1:50:35] from the Catholic means you're lost
[1:50:38] you're eternally lost you can never be
[1:50:40] saved you're doomed to hell and you
[1:50:42] don't get out of purgatory that's
[1:50:49] right
[1:50:51] are you with me
[1:50:55] yes let's just start saying What God
[1:50:58] Says amen amen that's right I'm in in
[1:51:02] the statement by this come on musician
[1:51:05] I've said this before and the brother
[1:51:06] asked me he said brother Dale do we have
[1:51:09] the faith of the
[1:51:12] fathers I said I don't believe everybody
[1:51:14] has
[1:51:15] it but I believe some has
[1:51:18] it
[1:51:21] he said' do we have the ministry of
[1:51:22] Jesus
[1:51:25] Christ I said not as a
[1:51:27] whole somebody has
[1:51:30] it for the part they must
[1:51:32] have now here's what I've been aiming at
[1:51:35] for weeks and weeks and weeks so
[1:51:38] listen if we won't
[1:51:41] confess that we have the faith of the
[1:51:46] fathers God
[1:51:48] cannot bring it to P that's right well
[1:51:53] it could be other people I okay we we
[1:51:55] we'll go along with that but I thought
[1:51:57] we supposed to talk about us being
[1:51:59] Christians cuz we could be totally lost
[1:52:02] and rest doing okay but every what it is
[1:52:05] somebody is going to say this is what we
[1:52:09] have right
[1:52:12] amen I've told you as much as I could
[1:52:14] about it there'll never be another
[1:52:17] Prophet to come with great things like
[1:52:19] that no
[1:52:21] but there's a bride around the world yes
[1:52:23] sir that to put together where God is
[1:52:26] dealing with each one of
[1:52:28] them and you have the faith of the
[1:52:34] fathers put together the ministry of
[1:52:37] Jesus
[1:52:39] Christ was you
[1:52:41] listening and I started off the whole
[1:52:44] thing trying to talk about the ministry
[1:52:46] of Jesus Christ was a purpose for making
[1:52:49] this statement
[1:52:51] unless somebody says it it can never
[1:52:54] come to
[1:53:03] pass I don't have a problem you're
[1:53:06] looking at me quietly sitting there I
[1:53:09] don't have no
[1:53:10] problem I just got the truth I just read
[1:53:13] you about 10 11 quotes where the Prophet
[1:53:16] said God can't do nothing until you
[1:53:20] confess
[1:53:22] it you know what he can't bring the
[1:53:24] faith of the fathers until somebody says
[1:53:27] it's already here he can't bring the
[1:53:29] ministry of Jesus Christ until somebody
[1:53:31] says it's
[1:53:35] here he can't bring the headstone until
[1:53:38] somebody says it's
[1:53:40] here he can't bring a chain to the body
[1:53:43] until somebody says it's
[1:53:48] here so you know you know maybe the
[1:53:51] prophet's
[1:53:53] right you know what I mean by that I'll
[1:53:56] put that back in your L not
[1:53:59] mine when he said God is waiting on you
[1:54:02] and
[1:54:05] I he's waiting on you and
[1:54:12] I
[1:54:16] right you know where I stand about the
[1:54:19] cuz I made my blunt and plain over the
[1:54:21] years about return Ministries and Tents
[1:54:24] and all but you know what may I go to
[1:54:27] conduct order and
[1:54:28] Doctrine no excuse me may I go to spoken
[1:54:31] words readal
[1:54:34] see all the waiting has always been on
[1:54:37] the people of
[1:54:40] God Moses went to
[1:54:43] Egypt to try to
[1:54:47] deliver he couldn't do it
[1:54:51] why because the
[1:54:54] people if you say you're sitting down
[1:54:56] waiting on brother brandom to come back
[1:54:58] just remember one thing he can't come
[1:55:01] back until the people is crying for him
[1:55:04] to come
[1:55:07] back that's all I've ever preached for
[1:55:10] 50
[1:55:13] years but people don't want to hear that
[1:55:15] they want something that they can look
[1:55:17] forward to do
[1:55:18] that
[1:55:20] is waiting on you and I that's
[1:55:27] right waiting for somebody to say it
[1:55:35] amen when the people got to say in Egypt
[1:55:38] Moses was sent
[1:55:41] back
[1:55:44] right and God didn't need a whole band
[1:55:46] of people to
[1:55:48] help
[1:55:51] he didn't even need ER and he got in
[1:55:52] trouble with it but he claimed he had to
[1:55:54] have him because he had a speech
[1:56:01] impediment see God's waiting on somebody
[1:56:04] to believe who they
[1:56:06] are
[1:56:09] right then he can make
[1:56:12] manifest what you
[1:56:16] say
[1:56:18] right so when we going to say it what we
[1:56:21] got let's stand when are we going to say
[1:56:23] it no we'll go outside talking about how
[1:56:26] bad it is s he p a debt page
[1:56:31] 398
[1:56:34] right I say it this way if we can't
[1:56:36] confess right for our healing they Ain
[1:56:38] much need to worry about salvation and
[1:56:40] getting out of here so we all going by
[1:56:42] the grave we might as well go by some
[1:56:43] food plot I

[2:00:17] believe it
[2:00:20] thank you Lord is that being some kind
[2:00:22] of a are we trying to work up a
[2:00:24] situation that's what it
[2:00:27] is I thought we was trying to believe
[2:00:29] God's
[2:00:33] word did he says we're
[2:00:37] healed but he's waiting on us to say it
[2:00:40] that he says we're saved but he's
[2:00:42] waiting on us to say
[2:00:47] it why
[2:00:50] can't we believe it thank you
[2:00:53] Lord you say thank you
[2:00:58] amen now I'm as honest as I can be folks
[2:01:01] of trying to do what I've tried to be
[2:01:04] these children right out
[2:01:08] here I don't think there's one child in
[2:01:10] this
[2:01:12] church now don't do it now For Heaven's
[2:01:15] Sake cuz I ain't got the money but there
[2:01:17] ain't a one of you I've proved it before
[2:01:19] four the a a one of you if I said walk
[2:01:22] up here and I'll give you $20 they'd
[2:01:24] come walking
[2:01:28] up why because they believe
[2:01:31] it that's childlike
[2:01:35] faith I thought it's what we're supposed
[2:01:37] to be with God I thought it was supposed
[2:01:40] to be some
[2:01:42] dramatic experience or this but just
[2:01:44] believe in
[2:01:48] God
[2:01:52] you see what I'm getting in folks we're
[2:01:55] living below our privileges because we
[2:01:57] want to confess what God has already
[2:02:01] done to where he can make it
[2:02:08] manifest now if you don't think that's
[2:02:10] right go home and read your
[2:02:12] Bible and think about everything in the
[2:02:14] Bible as I said was spoke by
[2:02:17] somebody
[2:02:23] who was
[2:02:25] it what it Abraham I
[2:02:29] guess and he went down and he conquered
[2:02:31] this that and the other I may be wrong
[2:02:34] names but it'll be you I think it is
[2:02:37] Abraham and he come back and he said God
[2:02:39] said I'll just give you
[2:02:46] 10% where' he get that th
[2:02:49] why do you want to give him why didn't
[2:02:51] he want to give him 50% why didn't you
[2:02:52] want to give a god high and high or
[2:02:58] something before the foundation of the
[2:03:00] world that's right God had already
[2:03:03] decreed that to
[2:03:06] be why do you pay 10% as a
[2:03:11] tithe because it's
[2:03:16] decreed
[2:03:17] right see Abraham just you Lord I'll
[2:03:22] just give you
[2:03:26] 10% and God just looks down through time
[2:03:28] and he says that'll just be for
[2:03:30] everything
[2:03:33] y the prophet one time if I ain't
[2:03:35] mistaken made a statement he said
[2:03:37] probably wind up be about that way in
[2:03:38] Salvation about
[2:03:41] 10%
[2:03:43] y see all this is not halfhazard
[2:03:46] thoughts that happens
[2:03:50] God knew before the foundation of the
[2:03:52] world where you'd be sitting right here
[2:03:54] today and he knew what I'd
[2:03:57] say but he knew what you'd
[2:04:06] think when are we going to get it down
