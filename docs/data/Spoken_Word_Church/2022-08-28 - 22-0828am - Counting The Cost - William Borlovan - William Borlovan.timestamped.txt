[9:50] amen amen glory to god isn't god so good
[9:53] to us
[9:54] amen are just sitting there in the
[9:56] office and just when are singing the
[9:57] praises of the lord the presence of god
[10:00] just drops down you know the bible
[10:02] teaches us that he inhabits
[10:04] the praises of his people
[10:06] if you want the glory of god to drop if
[10:09] you want the presence of god to to drop
[10:11] in your in our churches and in our homes
[10:13] and in our marriages praise the lord
[10:15] praise ye the lord in the good times in
[10:18] the bad times when you feel like
[10:19] praising him praise the lord when you
[10:21] don't feel like praising him and
[10:22] sometimes your body don't feel like
[10:24] praising him but you praise him anyhow
[10:28] because that brings the glory of the
[10:29] lord you see the the order we see the
[10:31] orders of the scripture and there's
[10:33] always praise before battle there's
[10:35] always praise and thanksgiving to the
[10:37] lord
[10:38] amen it's certainly good to be in the
[10:39] house of the lord this morning we'd like
[10:41] to greet you all thank you brother wade
[10:43] for having us inviting us up and brother
[10:44] samuel and all the ministry team here
[10:46] y'all have a wonderful team that
[10:48] that keeps things going and keeps this
[10:50] portion of god's bride on the straight
[10:53] and narrow amen we're living in such
[10:54] dark and tricky times and it's such a
[10:56] blessing to have a good church a good
[10:58] solid church to back you up
[11:00] and we appreciate y'all so much and we
[11:02] bring you greetings from our church in
[11:04] uh in virginia brother ron with andrew
[11:06] they send their love and their greetings
[11:08] and from the church and he certainly
[11:09] appreciates all those prayers and
[11:11] as you all know he's in a battle
[11:13] but god promised to be with us in the
[11:15] battle you know he didn't promise it'd
[11:17] only be good times it'd only be a
[11:18] flowery bed of ease he promised he'd
[11:20] never leave us or forsake us but i tell
[11:22] you what brothers and sisters he's
[11:24] certainly taken and many others
[11:26] has taken every excuse to not come to
[11:29] church
[11:31] when he stands there in his condition
[11:33] and he preaches and even when he don't
[11:35] preach he still he's still there pulling
[11:37] on the word standing up with maybe
[11:39] splitting headaches you never know but
[11:42] he's at his post of duty and your post
[11:44] of duty may not be behind a pulpit your
[11:46] post of duty is in the house of god
[11:49] amen so we certainly appreciate and love
[11:51] each and every one of you
[11:52] we like to thank my sister monica for
[11:54] hosting rebecca myself
[11:56] and her husband
[11:58] oh brother bob
[12:00] thank you brother bob
[12:02] he did a wonderful job this morning on
[12:04] sunday school didn't he amen
[12:06] appreciate i love them so much with all
[12:08] my heart and appreciate them and my wife
[12:11] and
[12:11] and my boys ended up having to stay home
[12:13] this time we're expecting another baby
[12:15] to do to arrive here
[12:17] in probably about seven eight weeks
[12:18] right in there so traveling is a bit
[12:20] difficult so we hope to
[12:22] bring my better half next time along
[12:25] and uh by the way said amen there was no
[12:27] there was no hesitation there he said
[12:29] amen right there
[12:31] so we certainly love y'all with all of
[12:32] our hearts
[12:33] we won't keep y'all standing but if you
[12:35] will if you turn with me to matthew the
[12:37] 13th chapter
[12:39] we'll begin with the 45th verse
[12:41] again it's certainly an honor and
[12:42] privilege to be in the house of the lord
[12:44] this morning with believers of light
[12:46] precious faith you believe the same
[12:48] message you're expecting the same lord
[12:49] jesus
[12:50] amen it's wonderful
[12:52] the bible says jesus speaking again
[12:56] the kingdom of heaven is likened to a
[12:58] merchant man
[13:00] seeking goodly pearls
[13:02] who when he had found one pearl of great
[13:05] price went and sold all that he had
[13:09] and bought it if you have to also turn
[13:11] with me to luke chapter 14 verse 27
[13:14] jesus also speaking
[13:17] and whosoever does not bear his cross
[13:20] and come after me
[13:22] cannot be my disciple
[13:24] for which of you intending to build a
[13:26] tower sitteth not down first and count
[13:29] off the cost whether he have sufficient
[13:32] to finish it lest happily after he hath
[13:35] laid the foundation
[13:37] and is not able to finish it all that
[13:39] beholdeth it began to mock him
[13:42] saying this man began to build and was
[13:44] not able to finish or what king going to
[13:47] make war against another king sitteth
[13:50] not down first and consult with whether
[13:52] he be able with ten thousand
[13:54] to meet him that cometh against him with
[13:57] twenty thousand or else while the other
[13:59] is a great way off he sendeth an message
[14:02] and desireth conditions of peace
[14:04] so likewise whosoever he be of you that
[14:08] forsaketh not all
[14:10] that he hath
[14:11] cannot be my disciple
[14:14] amen let's bow our heads in prayer the
[14:15] gracious kind heavenly father lord jesus
[14:17] we thank you so much lord for this honor
[14:19] and a privilege to stand among lord
[14:21] jesus the redeemed
[14:23] the very lord attribute to the living
[14:25] god father lord to be standing here we
[14:27] just counted such a privilege lord we
[14:29] thank you for your presence that's
[14:30] already here
[14:31] we thank you for your presence that
[14:32] always vindicates the word father god
[14:34] lord we just ask lord that you just now
[14:36] be with us come with us forgive us of
[14:38] our sins lord i just pray personally
[14:41] that you set me in a corner father lord
[14:42] and just use my own vessel or that i
[14:44] give to you even now speak the word to
[14:46] your people lord i within my humanity
[14:48] have nothing to say but father lord may
[14:50] your spirit say something that would
[14:51] help encourage
[14:53] strengthen and touch and deliver your
[14:55] people we love you lord and we promise
[14:57] to give you all the praise honor and
[14:59] glory in jesus christ's name amen amen
[15:01] god bless you in the presence of the
[15:03] lord this morning with help of the lord
[15:05] i'd like to
[15:06] give this sermon a title of counting the
[15:09] cost
[15:11] you know in our natural lives it's it's
[15:13] uh we have with the world that we live
[15:15] in
[15:16] with inflation constantly going up and
[15:19] you know every time we turn around seem
[15:20] like groceries and gas and all all the
[15:22] natural things of living we have to be
[15:24] careful of our spending many times and
[15:26] watch our budgeting and our financing
[15:28] and if something costs too much we may
[15:30] have to wait till it goes on sale or we
[15:31] look you know for that certain coupon
[15:33] that may help us to get just a little
[15:35] edge on things
[15:36] and we have to do that just as long as
[15:38] we we live in this life but you know
[15:40] there's also a spiritual application
[15:43] to cost
[15:44] and we and when you and as we look in
[15:46] the scriptures this morning it's
[15:48] it's a lot different in the spiritual
[15:50] than it is in the natural
[15:52] because in the natural as i said we try
[15:54] and save we we withhold things back and
[15:56] then maybe maybe we delay some instant
[15:59] gratification as it's called in order to
[16:01] save up for this that or the other
[16:04] or college or whatever stage you are in
[16:06] life but in the spiritual sense there's
[16:08] a spiritual application that we are
[16:10] always to go all in
[16:13] there is no there there's no retreat
[16:16] there's there's no going back there's no
[16:18] waiting until we get this thing done or
[16:21] maybe situated in our life or maybe one
[16:23] after i get married
[16:25] that will be the answer then i'll
[16:27] surrender my heart to the lord jesus or
[16:29] maybe after i get this job or maybe when
[16:31] i graduate i'm going to withhold
[16:33] something i'm going to save maybe my
[16:35] soul or i'm going to save save making a
[16:37] full surrender
[16:39] until after this or this may happen and
[16:42] the spiritual because the natural will
[16:44] be done away the money system will be
[16:46] done away with thank god we won't have
[16:48] money in heaven there won't be no
[16:49] spending there'll be no saving
[16:52] there'll be no bounce checks
[16:55] praise the lord you know and spiritually
[16:58] speaking when we go all in we now have
[17:00] the entire bank of heaven as it were
[17:03] that is behind us and the prophet
[17:04] teaches us that when we become born
[17:06] again god gives you a checkbook
[17:09] and in this checkbook all of heaven
[17:11] stands behind this word so whenever you
[17:14] write a check and you write your request
[17:16] brother bob it is a promise and a
[17:18] guarantee that that check will be cash
[17:23] people in today's society act like they
[17:25] have that in the natural but we find out
[17:27] it ends up catching up to them
[17:29] the government thinks they have that
[17:32] and they just print more money and they
[17:34] just go but you know this kingdom as i
[17:36] said is going to an end but in the
[17:37] spiritual we have a checkbook with
[17:40] unlimited resources we have a checkbook
[17:43] with unlimited finances
[17:47] whatever you desire
[17:50] as long as it's in the word and if your
[17:52] heart because see the checkbook doesn't
[17:54] come till after you're born again
[17:56] because before you're born again you can
[17:57] ask amiss and jesus said you have not
[18:00] because you asked not and you ask a miss
[18:03] you just ask for this or that and it
[18:05] doesn't is there's no spiritual
[18:07] application there's no real spiritual
[18:10] backdrop to why you want what you want
[18:14] you see when a person becomes born again
[18:16] and let's just say they're single they
[18:18] become born again they then begin to
[18:21] have the right reasons
[18:23] to want to get married
[18:25] they begin to look for the right things
[18:27] in a mate
[18:29] but before that they may look at the
[18:31] wrong things
[18:32] and we know there's an end to that so
[18:34] there's a spiritual application of going
[18:36] all in and many times you must count the
[18:39] cost of something and many times things
[18:42] can cost you dearly
[18:45] both naturally
[18:46] but but this morning this i'm not
[18:48] teaching finances this is teaching you
[18:50] spiritual things things can cost you
[18:52] very dearly spiritually
[18:55] both a good decision and a wrong
[18:57] decision but you've got to count the
[18:59] cost
[19:00] before you make a decision you've got to
[19:02] count the cost is this decision
[19:06] is this group of friends
[19:09] going to draw me closer to the lord
[19:12] or are they going to take me away from
[19:13] the lord
[19:15] am i going to be able to go to church
[19:18] with my friends
[19:20] or am i going to go do something else
[19:22] while church is going on with my friends
[19:24] and to that decision there is a cost to
[19:27] pay
[19:29] and you can either reap the benefits
[19:32] or or reap the wrong thing but you've
[19:35] got to count the cost to your actions
[19:39] we see in the scripture that when
[19:40] abraham brother bob was was teaching
[19:43] there on abraham when eight when when
[19:44] after the promise was fulfilled
[19:47] and they had more children and things
[19:49] that abraham did and when the process of
[19:51] time came and sarah died there came a
[19:53] time where eight where sarah needed
[19:56] abraham needed a burial place for for
[19:58] sarah
[20:00] now we know in the old testament that
[20:01] the burial place was very important
[20:04] abraham knew
[20:06] because of because he sought a king
[20:09] who's or he sought a city whose king and
[20:11] maker and builder was god he knew that
[20:13] it was very important on where to bury
[20:15] sarah in the promised land
[20:18] so you can read the scriptures and we're
[20:19] going to just skip over it uh this
[20:21] morning for the sake of time but there
[20:22] in genesis 23 he begins to look for a
[20:25] burial ground and he approaches his
[20:26] these people for the burial ground
[20:28] and he tells them why he needs it and
[20:30] they want it they want to give it to
[20:32] abraham
[20:33] they want to give this parcel of land
[20:35] saying look
[20:37] you bury your dead there you take them
[20:39] there lay them at rest it'll be yours
[20:41] don't worry about it but you can see in
[20:43] the scripture that abraham actually
[20:45] refused it for free
[20:49] now
[20:51] in our natural selves the idea of
[20:53] something especially like land if
[20:54] somebody knocked on your door and
[20:55] offered you a parcel of land for free
[20:57] any person would jump at it sure but
[20:59] there's a spiritual application that
[21:01] abraham wanted to make sure that
[21:02] throughout all generations that no one
[21:05] could come back and reclaim that land he
[21:07] wanted to pay for it he said no
[21:11] i'm not going to take it for free i'm
[21:12] going to pay and not only am i going to
[21:14] pay i'm going to pay top dollar for it
[21:18] i'm going to pay what it's worth
[21:21] and more than it's worth just so that it
[21:23] did not money was not was not did not
[21:25] matter to him
[21:27] now understand spiritual application
[21:29] here
[21:31] there's a spiritual application that
[21:33] abraham refuses the land for free he
[21:36] it's got to cost him something if
[21:39] something does not cost you something
[21:41] then you'll take you for granted you
[21:42] won't appreciate it
[21:45] and that's what's wrong with with with
[21:46] the generation that we live in is that
[21:48] things are given to them the more
[21:49] something is given to a person to
[21:51] humanity in general the less they
[21:53] appreciate it
[21:55] when someone is as as the saying goes
[21:57] born with a silver spoon in their mouth
[21:59] they don't appreciate the hard work it
[22:01] took to get there
[22:03] but i can appreciate naturally speaking
[22:05] we can appreciate a man or a woman
[22:07] that's successful that actually works
[22:09] for it
[22:12] so there's a spiritual application
[22:15] to counting the cost whenever boaz
[22:17] whenever ruth came back into the
[22:18] homeland with naomi it boaz had to count
[22:21] the cost what would it cost him
[22:24] to redeem to redeem ruth
[22:26] because we know her that there were the
[22:28] nearer kinsmen than boaz but when he
[22:30] counted the cost he said no i'm going to
[22:32] borrow my own inheritance but boaz knew
[22:34] what he was doing he went into the
[22:36] redemption with his eyes wide open
[22:40] he put his entire wealth his influence
[22:42] his name he put it all on the line for
[22:45] ruth if he redeemed ruth everything boaz
[22:48] was
[22:50] was now going to be attributed to ruth
[22:54] now everything that everything
[22:56] ruth was a moabiter she was this that
[22:58] culture does this they're an enemy to
[23:00] israel all this
[23:02] but boaz counted the cost
[23:05] and ruth was worth it to him amen
[23:09] amen you see the spiritual application
[23:11] there
[23:12] because we and ourselves were no good
[23:16] but everything god was his entire
[23:19] reputation
[23:32] he attached his name to yours
[23:38] so
[23:40] when he attached his name to yours you
[23:42] now have his authority
[23:50] jesus didn't get cheap with redemption
[23:55] now remember understand as we go along
[23:58] i don't mean i don't know that the
[24:00] situation and everyone's got their own
[24:02] personality if they're spinners or if
[24:04] they're not this is not what this is
[24:05] about this isn't to justify you know you
[24:08] go out the door and say babe the
[24:10] preacher said
[24:11] you gotta we gotta give it all
[24:14] i want that mercedes he said give it all
[24:18] no no no
[24:22] so understand this is spiritual
[24:24] jesus counter the cost
[24:27] in the old testament we find that david
[24:29] actually sinned there came a time where
[24:30] david began to desire a census of the
[24:33] people
[24:34] so he began to number the people and he
[24:37] wanted to find out how many soldiers he
[24:39] had and god and that really displeased
[24:41] the lord and job tried to talk him out
[24:42] of it but but he but he went anyway and
[24:44] he he numbered him
[24:46] and then he realized that he had
[24:48] actually done wrong and and the prophet
[24:50] i believe it was god came to him and
[24:51] said god has given you three options a
[24:54] punishment for this sin
[24:56] he said you can either have three years
[24:57] of famine
[24:59] three years or three months of defeat
[25:01] before your enemies or three days of
[25:02] pestilence you decide
[25:05] well david did the right thing he just
[25:07] he he was repentant and he threw himself
[25:09] at the mercy of the lord he said i'm not
[25:10] going to choose i'm going to be at the
[25:12] mercy of the lord because i've already
[25:13] made the wrong decision once i can do it
[25:15] again
[25:16] so
[25:17] as god ended up choosing that there
[25:19] would be the three days of pestilence
[25:20] and there fell of israel seventy
[25:22] thousand men in first chronicles 21
[25:26] 14 so the lord
[25:27] sent pestilence upon israel and there
[25:29] fell of israel seventy thousand men and
[25:32] god sent an angel unto jerusalem to res
[25:34] to destroy it
[25:36] and as he was destroying the lord be
[25:38] held and he repented him of the evil and
[25:41] said to the angel that destroyeth
[25:44] it is enough
[25:45] stay now thy hand and the angel of the
[25:47] lord stood by the threshing floor of
[25:49] ornan the jebusite and david lifted up
[25:52] his eyes
[25:53] and saw the angel of the lord stand
[25:55] between earth and heaven having a drawn
[25:57] sword in his hand stretched out over
[25:59] jerusalem imagine seeing that
[26:01] imagine seeing the judgment angel and 70
[26:04] 000 men and you are responsible for 70
[26:07] 000 deaths because you made a mistake
[26:10] see david didn't count the cost of his
[26:12] actions
[26:13] before doing that
[26:15] then david and the elders of israel who
[26:17] were clothed with cloth with sackcloth
[26:20] and sackcloth fell upon their faces
[26:22] and then further down
[26:24] and david said unto god is it not i that
[26:26] commanded the people to be numbered even
[26:28] i is it is that have sinned and done
[26:30] evil indeed but as for these sheep what
[26:32] have they done let that hand i pray thee
[26:34] o lord be on me and on my father's house
[26:36] and not on thy people that they should
[26:38] be plagued
[26:39] and the angel of the lord commanded god
[26:41] to say to david that david should go up
[26:43] and set an altar unto the lord in the
[26:45] threshing floor of onan the jebusite so
[26:48] david did as the angel of the lord
[26:50] instructed and when when when ornan seen
[26:53] david coming down
[26:54] he and david and david wanted that in
[26:56] verse 22 then david said to ornan grant
[26:58] me the place of this threshing floor
[27:00] that i may build an altar therein unto
[27:02] the lord thou shalt grant it to me for
[27:06] full price
[27:08] that the plague may be stayed from the
[27:11] people now listen to ornan and ornan
[27:12] said unto david take it
[27:14] to thee and let my lord the king do that
[27:17] which is good in his eyes lo i give it
[27:19] thee i'll give you the oxen for the
[27:21] burnt offerings the threshing floor
[27:23] instruments for wood and the wheat for
[27:24] the meat offering i'll give it to you
[27:26] i'll give it all to you
[27:27] you're the king you're god's anointed
[27:29] you're god's blessed i'll give it to you
[27:31] so so because that god that's what god
[27:33] called you to do and listen to what look
[27:34] at what david says and king david
[27:38] said to ornanee
[27:40] but i will verily buy it for the full
[27:43] price
[27:46] for i will not take that which is dying
[27:48] for the lord nor burn offerings without
[27:50] a cost david knew it had to cost him
[27:53] something it had to he can't just get a
[27:55] mistake and it not cost something
[27:58] it had to cost david something he had to
[28:00] feel the pain
[28:02] of his repentance
[28:04] repentance without regret for our sins
[28:07] is not true repentance it's also what's
[28:09] called the dried-out confession you
[28:10] really you know people people feel sorry
[28:13] or feel bad that they got caught but
[28:14] they don't feel sad or really repentant
[28:17] in their heart for what they actually
[28:18] did
[28:20] that's the difference it's got to then
[28:21] cost you something
[28:23] it may cost you some friends or true
[28:26] repentance toward god is going to cause
[28:27] you to change how you live
[28:30] it may you know drawing closer to the
[28:32] lord is how do we draw closer to the
[28:34] lord by read our bible and pray
[28:36] it's going to cost us a little more time
[28:38] on our knees it's going to cost us a
[28:41] little more time reading the bible even
[28:43] dare i say when you don't feel like it
[28:48] preachers don't always feel like
[28:50] studying
[28:53] that may be a news flash is that right
[28:55] my brothers
[28:56] preachers don't always feel like praying
[28:59] preachers don't always feel like
[29:00] preaching
[29:02] [Music]
[29:04] but it's not us it's not up it's not up
[29:06] to how we feel
[29:10] but there's a cost to it
[29:13] but the reward will always way outweigh
[29:17] the cost
[29:19] so david wanted to pay he would refuse
[29:22] it for free just like abraham do you see
[29:24] that strain they refuse things for free
[29:27] because there's a spiritual application
[29:29] to paying all giving it all you don't
[29:32] hold back when we serve god we serve god
[29:34] with all of our hearts with everything
[29:36] that we have
[29:38] if we don't serve god with all of our
[29:40] hearts then we're not fully surrendered
[29:45] so we come to the greatest example jesus
[29:47] christ the son of david
[29:50] he countered that cost of redemption
[29:53] before the foundation of the world he
[29:54] already counted it he already knew what
[29:56] it would cost him and he already took
[29:58] care of it in his mind it was a finished
[30:00] work
[30:02] but in time he had then
[30:04] as his attributes and the different
[30:06] attributes within him of love and father
[30:08] and savior and healer it then took time
[30:11] to draw that
[30:12] to bring that down from him to humanity
[30:14] but he's always had that right
[30:16] in first peter 1 18 for as much as you
[30:18] know that you were not redeemed with
[30:21] corruptible things
[30:23] in the old testament when the brother
[30:24] had to sell out because he had hit hard
[30:27] times and he had to actually sell his
[30:28] inheritance to his brother in israel you
[30:30] know and then every every 50 years a
[30:32] jubilee trumpet would sound if there was
[30:34] a near kinsman that could actually
[30:35] redeem him they were the cost of
[30:36] redemption was many times with silver
[30:40] that's why peter brings this up we have
[30:41] jeremiah even redeem his cousin there
[30:44] with silver
[30:46] it's a type of redemption but then when
[30:48] peter comes he said for as much you know
[30:49] you know they were still in their old
[30:50] testament frame of mind that they had to
[30:52] be bought and he said that you were not
[30:54] redeemed with corruptible things
[30:58] as silver and gold from your vain
[30:59] conversation received by the tradition
[31:02] of your from your father's but with the
[31:04] precious blood of christ
[31:08] as with a lamb without blemish
[31:11] and without spot
[31:13] he was priceless
[31:15] that blood was priceless but your soul
[31:19] was priceless
[31:21] your soul was priceless
[31:24] you know you sometimes see or you hear
[31:26] you know sometimes you just see a
[31:27] picture of the picture whenever you hear
[31:30] of art you know and i know that the
[31:32] vatican in different places in the world
[31:33] has them
[31:34] and they literally cost so much money
[31:36] brother bob they're literally priceless
[31:40] you they're they're they're so valuable
[31:42] you cannot even put a price tag on it
[31:44] no matter how much money somebody may
[31:46] have and say i want that you can't you
[31:48] don't have enough money i've got so and
[31:50] so it don't matter that's not enough
[31:51] it's priceless
[31:54] you're the bride of jesus christ is
[31:56] priceless
[31:58] the blood of jesus christ is the only
[32:00] thing
[32:02] that could afford to actually redeem
[32:04] your souls
[32:06] it was the blood is the only thing that
[32:08] could pay the price of redemption now it
[32:10] could be any man's blood
[32:12] you know sometimes you you love your
[32:14] family so much you would gladly give
[32:16] your blood you'd gladly give your life
[32:17] to protect them and even if you were to
[32:20] try and pay and and someone committed a
[32:22] crime and that actually have to pay for
[32:24] it which happened repeatedly in history
[32:26] and does to this day
[32:27] they pay for their sins with their own
[32:29] life that's still not enough because
[32:31] once you've paid for your sins and you
[32:32] were killed well you're dead what how is
[32:35] that gonna what purpose is that
[32:37] but you needed a higher life that could
[32:40] come and die for you yet raise you up
[32:42] yet he himself be raised up
[32:45] it took a higher life a higher blood to
[32:48] do the work
[32:50] so remember when god created things and
[32:52] as he started from the little worked his
[32:53] way all the way up to the top god has
[32:55] his own brother said his own evolution
[32:58] as it were when he created an oak tree
[33:00] it always was an oak tree but the
[33:02] intelligence worked its way up he
[33:04] started with the lowlifes
[33:06] and he worked his way up and he capped
[33:08] it off with man that was like the
[33:10] capstone of his creation so when man
[33:12] fell
[33:14] that's why you get bit by fire ants
[33:16] because the fire get we get stung by
[33:18] bees and we get poison ivy and stickers
[33:20] and all these things is because they all
[33:22] that creation was under man
[33:24] so that nature fell so the only thing
[33:26] that could redeem us is something that
[33:28] was higher than us
[33:30] so the only thing higher than us is god
[33:33] so it took god to become flesh to pay
[33:36] the full price for your redemption
[33:38] imagine if he only came what good would
[33:40] it have done brothers and sisters if he
[33:42] would have only come and paid for your
[33:44] natural healing you get healed you get
[33:46] sick again you get healed and eventually
[33:47] death will take you and that's the end
[33:49] of it
[33:50] it's not enough that would have been a
[33:52] partial payment
[33:54] but he paid full price for you
[33:58] because remember whenever adam and eve
[33:59] sold us out and we ended up in the
[34:01] devil's pawn shop he didn't come try and
[34:03] get a discount he didn't come and try
[34:04] and just steal you out of the devil's
[34:06] pawn shop
[34:08] he paid for you he could walk out with
[34:10] you and you can walk out with him in
[34:12] broad daylight through the doors
[34:15] as it was
[34:17] he paid full price for you that should
[34:20] make it that should make us feel real
[34:21] good
[34:24] that god himself was not looking at you
[34:26] as a discount he wasn't waiting until
[34:29] you were just the right price he wasn't
[34:31] waiting until maybe you know what i i
[34:33] can get this kind of redemption to send
[34:35] an angel
[34:36] i can get this kind of redemption to
[34:38] send some second person of the trinity
[34:40] he came himself
[34:42] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[34:46] paid the full price for you
[34:49] and for me because he counted the cost
[34:52] and because you are worth it
[34:55] you know the world is is in the spirit
[34:58] of confusion and people's rights and
[34:59] everybody says to monica is all trying
[35:01] to find their worth
[35:03] who they are and and and
[35:06] and what they identify as and all kinds
[35:08] of nonsense
[35:10] but your soul
[35:12] is worth ten thousand words
[35:15] your soul is worth something your soul
[35:17] was worth the blood of god
[35:21] he paid full price for you
[35:24] and we're proud to say it we're proud to
[35:26] identify it
[35:28] when you pay when he paid full price for
[35:30] you
[35:31] in matthew 26 jesus in the garden of
[35:33] gethsemane
[35:35] then came with jesus into the place
[35:37] called the gethsemane and saith unto his
[35:39] disciples sit ye here while i pray and
[35:41] go yonder
[35:43] and he took with him peter and the two
[35:45] sons of zebedee and begin to be
[35:46] sorrowful and very heavy then saith he
[35:48] unto them my soul is exceedingly
[35:51] sorrowful
[35:53] even unto death terry here wants with me
[35:55] and you went a little further and fell
[35:57] on his face and prayed saying o my
[35:59] father if it be possible let this cup
[36:02] pass for me
[36:03] nevertheless not as i will but as thou
[36:06] wilt
[36:07] what was jesus doing in the garden he
[36:09] was counting the cost
[36:12] was he willing
[36:14] to go all the way
[36:17] he'd heal the sick
[36:19] he'd cleanse the leopard he'd cast out
[36:21] devils he's preached the truth he's
[36:23] delivered he's blessed people but he is
[36:25] he willing to go all the way
[36:28] because the sick that he healed 2000
[36:30] years ago what good is that do you and
[36:32] me today
[36:33] if he didn't go all the way if he didn't
[36:35] pay the full price what good would that
[36:37] do
[36:38] us so he comes to his disciples and he
[36:41] finds him asleep and we'll go down to
[36:42] verse 42 and he went again the second
[36:44] time saying oh my father if this cup may
[36:47] not pass away from me except i drink it
[36:50] thy will be done
[36:52] aren't you so thankful that we have a
[36:54] god that was so that's so submissive to
[36:56] his own word
[36:58] so submissive to his own word that even
[37:00] in the garden of eden when he said that
[37:01] day you eat that day that you'll die
[37:04] how it broke his heart to be submitted
[37:06] to his own word but he had to to make
[37:08] him god he had to so that we could have
[37:11] that checkbook he had to submit himself
[37:13] to his own word so we can trust him so
[37:16] you can trust him by the way so you can
[37:18] trust him for your healing so you can
[37:19] trust him for your salvation he had to
[37:21] be to serve a god
[37:24] that would be submissive to his own law
[37:28] that don't do like the politicians today
[37:30] that change it to serve their end
[37:33] but to actually set it not be able to
[37:36] change it and then step into humanity
[37:39] and become
[37:41] penalty
[37:43] to his own word
[37:46] and to pay the full price
[37:50] brother graham speaking he said let's
[37:52] he's talking about jesus aren't you
[37:54] thankful for a prophet that can see
[37:56] things unfold with the eyes of an eagle
[37:57] and god and go all the way down and
[37:59] actually dramatize something for you
[38:01] that just kind of paints such a
[38:02] beautiful picture
[38:04] he said let's just think i can see
[38:06] gabriel come down his great sword
[38:07] standing by side i can see woodworm i
[38:10] can see the other great angels lighting
[38:12] on the rocks around what was it
[38:14] a conference table being said the
[38:17] disciples might have been asleep but
[38:18] jesus wasn't alone
[38:21] then that holy spirit of god as we see
[38:24] on the picture of gethsemane that light
[38:25] which god is light elohim the
[38:27] self-existing one when he came into his
[38:30] presence do you want to go
[38:32] through with this son
[38:35] what the angels are listening
[38:39] because if jesus would have come to this
[38:40] point and said father actually
[38:43] the sins the trans as the transfer of
[38:45] sins begin to unfold and release onto
[38:48] him
[38:49] even though
[38:50] i wasn't born here and you weren't born
[38:52] yet yet our sins were still transferred
[38:55] to him at that time every sin that
[38:57] happened before him and every sin that
[38:59] ever will happen after was transferred
[39:02] onto him
[39:04] so if he would have come up to the
[39:05] garden of gethsemane and then backed off
[39:09] sister kaley then that would have ruined
[39:11] the whole plan of redemption
[39:15] so all of heaven is no doubt listening
[39:17] are you going to go through with this
[39:19] you're at this junction you're beginning
[39:21] to feel the anguish brother luis of the
[39:23] sins of the world upon you but are you
[39:26] going to go through with it
[39:28] what are you gonna do what's gonna be
[39:30] the result the whole world
[39:33] lays upon your shoulder
[39:36] do you want to pay the price
[39:42] or what do you want to do
[39:46] it came down jesus was at a junction
[39:50] he had to decide what was he going to do
[39:53] was he going to pay the full price for
[39:57] you
[40:00] you can come right on now without death
[40:05] there lays calvary before you they're
[40:07] there they'll spit in your face and
[40:10] they'll take you to calvary all these
[40:12] things you'll die in agony jesus knew
[40:15] what kind of death he would die
[40:18] he knew what laid before him but he also
[40:21] knew what laid before him he looked
[40:25] through he looked through the eyes of
[40:26] love and mercy and through the eyes of
[40:28] the blood and he was able to see you at
[40:30] this end time
[40:32] having the ability not within yourself
[40:35] but having the ability given to you by
[40:37] him
[40:38] through the new birth despite all the
[40:41] evil in just the past few years how much
[40:43] more evil has this world gotten how much
[40:45] more evil has it will this world get it
[40:48] does not matter to the born-again
[40:51] believer because they're still standing
[40:54] they're not gonna just drag it to heaven
[40:56] and crawl in like you're just at the end
[40:58] of a boot camp and just barely made it
[41:00] and just oh hanging on to somebody's
[41:02] heels you're going to march into glory
[41:06] when the prophet seen the bride and the
[41:08] vision they were not just slouched they
[41:11] were not just worn out they were not
[41:13] just
[41:13] all confused they were all in a line and
[41:15] they were going in one direction and
[41:17] they were going to the step of the word
[41:22] and there at the end at the very end
[41:24] of the end which is where we live now
[41:26] there was one that got out of step and
[41:28] what the prophet heard himself holler to
[41:30] scream out stay in
[41:33] i've heard this is just if i can just
[41:35] say if you forgive me i'll inject this
[41:37] here
[41:37] i personally believe that's the fifo
[41:40] ministry preaching what the prophet
[41:42] taught keeping that word in line and as
[41:44] we listen to the tapes we continue to be
[41:46] told to stay in line
[41:49] we're preaching the same brother ram
[41:51] because go past the curtain of time and
[41:52] say i preach what paul preached he could
[41:54] say that confidently and i believe true
[41:56] men of god can sin confidently in this
[41:58] age before god himself and say i
[42:00] preached what william branham preached
[42:05] it's the same message it's the same
[42:06] truth
[42:11] so he paid the full price jesus was
[42:13] aware of what it was going to cost him
[42:16] he says let's see what the conference
[42:18] what's the echo going to be all angels
[42:20] are standing around wondering what takes
[42:23] place now the decisions made what is it
[42:25] not my will but thine be done oh the
[42:30] angels unfolded their blessings and
[42:32] began to minister to him preparing him
[42:35] for that great hour
[42:38] bride you have been prepared for this
[42:41] hour
[42:42] you have been prepared and ordained to
[42:44] walk in this evil age you think of how
[42:47] how mad it must make the enemy that here
[42:49] he's got his his evil age he's the god
[42:51] of this evil age he's got satan's eating
[42:53] and he's setting it up and it's all
[42:55] going so well but yet there's a small
[42:57] group of people that scattered all over
[42:59] the world that no matter what i throw at
[43:01] them no matter what kind of influences
[43:04] no matter what kind of filth that i spew
[43:06] out in the age yet they still believe
[43:08] god
[43:09] yet in the age of greatest unbelief yet
[43:11] in the age where nobody even knows what
[43:13] to believe yet they stand there and they
[43:15] keep believing for the body change every
[43:17] every wednesday night and every sunday
[43:19] and every weekend they keep preaching
[43:21] that their body is going to change
[43:24] now
[43:25] to to do the carnal mind into a heart of
[43:28] unbelief
[43:29] that can sound impossible and naturally
[43:32] speaking it is because you can't explain
[43:34] it but to the spiritual mind it's a
[43:36] whole other level
[43:38] you know you think 500 years ago if you
[43:40] walked into the church this morning and
[43:41] you seen an airplane go overhead
[43:43] it didn't bother you there's an airplane
[43:46] 500 years ago what if an airplane would
[43:48] have flown overhead they would have all
[43:49] jumped in caves they would have been
[43:50] terrified
[43:52] but it's nothing to you you're used to
[43:53] it
[43:54] a cargo down the road
[43:57] there goes one now
[43:59] i didn't see any of you jump up and run
[44:00] out and terrified but you know several
[44:03] hundred years ago they would have seen
[44:04] that they would have been scared to
[44:05] death
[44:07] so what it used to be so hard to imagine
[44:10] is now everyday life to us we all came
[44:12] to church in a vehicle so what now can
[44:15] be so hard to imagine for the unbeliever
[44:16] of the body change and angels and the
[44:18] things of god it could be so hard to
[44:20] imagine one day that's going to become
[44:22] our that's our reality now spiritually
[44:25] that's our reality now but then it will
[44:27] become a literal reality
[44:29] where our bodies will literally be
[44:31] changed
[44:33] and i'll say this god doesn't get cheap
[44:38] god
[44:39] maybe we'll get to it but you think of
[44:40] the new jerusalem you read about the new
[44:43] jerusalem and the city you're going to
[44:44] god doesn't get cheap
[44:47] oh buddy it's going to be beautiful and
[44:48] god don't get cheap with your mansion
[44:51] you're gonna be perfect
[44:54] look at your neighbor and say i'm gonna
[44:55] look good
[44:58] you're gonna look good 18 years old
[45:00] you're going to look good amen
[45:02] why because god doesn't get cheap
[45:05] you're going to look perfect
[45:07] we don't have to worry about you know
[45:10] keto and thm and carbs and
[45:13] it's going to be perfect
[45:16] thank you lord yes it's going to be
[45:18] awesome because god doesn't get cheap
[45:22] now remember he owns the cattle on a
[45:24] thousand hills
[45:26] he owns it all but you can see the love
[45:28] of god in his mind he made sure that you
[45:31] have the best
[45:33] and while we're speaking of the best
[45:34] i'll say this the message produces the
[45:37] best
[45:38] the message produces your best marriages
[45:42] the message the message produces our
[45:43] best young people the message produces
[45:46] our best elderly people the message
[45:48] produces the best ministers the best
[45:49] song leaders the best everything the
[45:51] message produces the best
[45:54] amen
[45:57] so if jesus was only born of a virgin he
[45:59] did all the miracles and then he was
[46:01] just translated to heaven that would not
[46:03] have been good enough
[46:06] even with all the miracles even with
[46:07] born of a virgin that would not have
[46:08] been good enough because he would have
[46:10] bypassed the cross he would not have
[46:12] paid the full price it was not enough
[46:14] for him to just be born of a of a virgin
[46:16] and being in a body of flesh like we are
[46:18] into growing an of a headache and lose a
[46:20] best friend and all them things that he
[46:22] he partook of so he'll understand he had
[46:25] to go all the way to the cross
[46:28] and a step further than that but we'll
[46:30] probably get to that a little later but
[46:32] he had to go all the way to the cross
[46:35] to pay the full price now we know that
[46:36] satan when he tented jesus in the
[46:38] mountain there
[46:39] he offered jesus the kingdoms of the
[46:41] world without paying the full price
[46:44] he offered jesus the easy way
[46:46] now remember that was a temptation for
[46:48] jesus
[46:49] satan only had three shots at jesus you
[46:51] better believe that he made every single
[46:53] one of them count
[46:54] he had three strikes he had three shots
[46:57] to get at jesus and one of them was to
[46:59] try and get him to get the kingdoms of
[47:02] the world without paying for them
[47:04] because remember
[47:05] he didn't just have to come to redeem
[47:07] you he had to also come and redeem the
[47:08] earth so the blood the blood saved us by
[47:11] the blood also dripped down and sanctify
[47:13] the earth because we're gonna come back
[47:14] here and live remember
[47:17] god is awesome he is an awesome
[47:18] architect and i believe that he's got
[47:21] you know volcanoes underneath just right
[47:23] and at the right time they'll drop the
[47:24] right bomb in the wrong place or maybe
[47:26] the right place and it's going the whole
[47:27] thing's going to blow
[47:29] and then god's going to recrea we
[47:31] recreate it and make it perfect
[47:35] make it perfect he's going to do it
[47:37] right my goodness
[47:40] it's going to be perfect
[47:43] yes
[47:44] you know whenever when jesus went to the
[47:46] cross and satan was speaking through
[47:47] them priests if thou be the son of god
[47:49] come down from the cross you think of
[47:51] the temptation of jesus he was tempted
[47:52] constantly
[47:54] he was so see it's not wrong to be
[47:56] tempted it's wrong to actually heat
[47:58] temptation
[47:59] to fall into it
[48:01] so jesus was tempted all the way he was
[48:03] literally hanging on the cross and still
[48:06] being tempted to come down but even
[48:08] though they nailed him to a cross even
[48:09] though he was his face was bleeding he
[48:11] was he was just pulverized naturally
[48:14] speaking he had the sins on the world
[48:16] yet he was not dead yet so yet if he
[48:19] would have even come off at that point
[48:20] that wouldn't have been enough he had to
[48:22] say
[48:23] it is finished
[48:26] that's what he had to say because then
[48:28] when he's finished then the price the
[48:30] full price brother aaron of redemption
[48:33] was paid
[48:35] you could go free
[48:37] you can go free you are bought and paid
[48:40] for
[48:42] to be beaten and mocked was not enough
[48:43] for my sins
[48:46] to be nailed to a cross was not enough
[48:48] for my sins he
[48:50] had to die
[48:52] the life had to go out of his body
[48:56] to pay the price
[48:58] as that famous poem says living he loved
[49:01] me dying he saved me
[49:03] buried he carried my sins far away
[49:06] rising he justified
[49:08] freely forever
[49:10] someday he's coming oh glory his day
[49:15] because remember the prophet teaches us
[49:16] that if he that's what i meant by a
[49:18] stepfather if he would have came down
[49:19] for our sins saved us and he would not
[49:21] have actually rose from the dead
[49:24] then he could be questioned who he was
[49:26] but whenever he rose the prophet said
[49:28] that sealed the whole thing
[49:32] when he rose from the dead that proved
[49:33] it
[49:36] now you know satan probably was sitting
[49:38] around well i know he was sitting around
[49:40] he was speaking to them priests he was
[49:42] he was busy that morning that afternoon
[49:44] but whenever he heard jesus say it is
[49:47] finished no doubt he thought okay
[49:49] whoever this man is because i'm gonna
[49:51] read some quotes here but brother graham
[49:52] teaches us that satan all he wasn't
[49:54] quite sure what to think of jesus he
[49:56] could see god in him he could see him
[49:58] being defeated on every turn constantly
[50:00] being cast out his demons and things but
[50:03] he could see the humanity of him and it
[50:05] really confused the devil
[50:08] so no doubt that whenever jesus cried
[50:10] out it is finished and he bowed his head
[50:12] and died satan thought okay
[50:14] whoever he was he's gone
[50:16] i killed him just like i did the
[50:18] prophets i i i s you know i killed
[50:21] isaiah and i got job and i got moses and
[50:24] i got this one whoever he is he did the
[50:25] most damage to my kingdom than anyone
[50:27] else
[50:28] so far
[50:29] but whoever he is he's gone
[50:32] i've got no more to deal with but what
[50:33] he didn't understand is that jesus was
[50:36] just getting started
[50:38] where it looked like he came to an end
[50:40] jesus was just getting started
[50:43] it was just about to get really good
[50:46] you see because satan couldn't
[50:48] understand the virgin birth
[50:50] brother brahm says that when he that
[50:54] but when he met jesus christ he said it
[50:56] is written talking about jesus said it
[50:57] is written that shall not tempt the lord
[50:59] thy god
[51:00] see but then he knew that he was more
[51:02] than a match then he didn't understand
[51:05] the virgin birth satan didn't
[51:08] but he couldn't understand that but
[51:09] there was one that was one time
[51:11] that god pulled it over on him then
[51:15] was when he had the virgin birth
[51:19] because satan all them rumors they said
[51:21] that she actually mary got pregnant the
[51:23] roman soldier and
[51:25] i don't know there's just so much
[51:26] there's humanity but yet there's
[51:27] something different about him i can't
[51:29] make him fall like i could moses i
[51:31] tempted him with temper but i couldn't
[51:33] quite get him there i tried to tempt him
[51:35] with lust and i couldn't quite get him
[51:36] there like i did david or i tried this
[51:38] that or the other
[51:40] so he knew there was something different
[51:41] about him but i love how the prophet
[51:43] said that is that is one time that god
[51:45] was able to pull one over on him you
[51:47] talk about humility satan is a shrewd
[51:48] fellow he had all these sick he had all
[51:50] those what 4 000 years to study humanity
[51:54] and god was still able
[51:56] god still he always out with the devil
[52:00] the holy ghost in you were out with well
[52:02] out with that old slew foot too you
[52:03] can't outwit them
[52:05] within your flesh brother you we cannot
[52:07] outsmart the devil but the holy ghost
[52:09] will lead you and just confuse the enemy
[52:13] satan will set a trap for you here and
[52:15] the old boy looks like you just headed
[52:16] right toward it he looks like there's
[52:18] just no other way out and the holy ghost
[52:19] would just lead you right here all
[52:21] around the trent and the devil how in
[52:22] the world did he not get in that trap
[52:25] you would have
[52:27] because satan knows you he knows your
[52:28] weaknesses he knows he knows your dna he
[52:31] knows your family history he knows your
[52:33] family history
[52:34] oh way better than you do
[52:37] he's been watching them he's been
[52:39] watching their weaknesses and he knows
[52:40] what weaknesses that you have in your
[52:42] humanity
[52:43] but the holy ghost in you will lead you
[52:46] right around the footsteps of the
[52:47] righteous are ordered of the lord
[52:51] brother graham dramatized in here that
[52:52] whenever jesus was going up the cross
[52:55] he still wondered he wondered just what
[52:57] that was was that a prophet or was that
[53:00] really god
[53:01] he didn't know he didn't know
[53:04] then that god had to be made flesh and
[53:06] dwelt among us
[53:07] one day a roman soldier put a bandage
[53:09] around his face took a read and hit him
[53:10] on the head and said now if you be a
[53:12] prophet if you be this prophet tell us
[53:14] who hit you still he couldn't answer
[53:16] because he had been minding the devil
[53:21] oh the cross they asked him let me just
[53:23] say this you can be at work you can be
[53:24] at school and there could be
[53:27] a little tormentor that you have on the
[53:29] job
[53:30] and they and they could be asking you
[53:32] why do you have long hair why do you
[53:34] have a dress and you know that they're
[53:36] not really
[53:38] interested they just want to just make
[53:40] fun of you you don't have to answer them
[53:43] you don't know if they're interested
[53:45] tell them of the hope that lies within
[53:46] you never be ashamed to witness but when
[53:49] they're just one of them people on the
[53:50] job that you just have to commit to the
[53:52] lord
[53:55] you know you don't have to explain
[53:57] everything to them
[54:00] jesus didn't clown for the devil
[54:03] just if you've got a gift in your life
[54:04] and and they and you know you can sing
[54:06] beautifully brothers or sisters and and
[54:08] they try and get you to sing some
[54:10] worldly song you don't have to sing some
[54:11] worldly song for the devil you don't
[54:12] have to clown for the devil
[54:15] so going up the hill to calvary satan
[54:17] still wasn't satisfied that that was god
[54:20] emmanuel the virgin-born
[54:22] son of god
[54:24] i would say one of satan's biggest
[54:26] mistakes is letting jesus get to the
[54:27] cross
[54:29] you know you think satan was all about
[54:31] crucifying him crucifying him he'd
[54:33] anoint he'd anoint the priest he'd
[54:34] anoint this person he'd anoint that
[54:36] person he anointed the roman soldiers to
[54:37] do what they did to him and all these
[54:39] things because he was satan was trying
[54:41] to get rid of jesus
[54:43] but in fact his greatest mistake is
[54:45] letting jesus go all the way to the
[54:47] cross you see how he outsmarted the
[54:49] devil well satan could not wait to
[54:51] actually crown
[54:53] kill this jesus
[54:56] the very thing that satan thought he
[54:57] actually won it was his very defeat
[55:01] because if jesus didn't go all the way
[55:04] you couldn't have the holy ghost you
[55:06] couldn't get the new birth you couldn't
[55:07] be justified sanctified and filled with
[55:09] holy ghost we wouldn't have this message
[55:14] so
[55:15] god paul really did pull one over on him
[55:19] and such humility
[55:21] so after jesus said it was finished
[55:23] satan found out in a very short order
[55:26] that he wasn't just a prophet
[55:28] he found out very short when he heard a
[55:30] knock on hell
[55:32] remember whenever brother bram
[55:33] dramatizes that and he opens that door
[55:35] and he sees jesus i thought i killed you
[55:38] i thought i had you and i had job i
[55:39] thought i had you and i got moses i
[55:41] thought i had you i had you but he found
[55:43] out real quick
[55:46] that he made a big mistake
[55:48] because not only did jesus still show up
[55:51] he dropped your sins and my sins right
[55:54] on the devil in hell where they belong
[55:58] okay so now all of our sins all your
[56:01] past and everything is now attributed to
[56:03] the devil
[56:05] who's the father of all sin who's the
[56:06] father of all eyes
[56:08] and you're perfect
[56:10] so whenever jesus he proved that not
[56:13] only did he
[56:15] pay the full price not only did he raise
[56:17] from the dead but then he actually went
[56:18] and took the keys of death hell and the
[56:21] grave he went there and he conquered
[56:25] hell for you
[56:27] hell still exists hell is a real place
[56:31] but you don't have to go there
[56:34] because he paid the price of hell for
[56:37] you
[56:38] he went there for you he deposited your
[56:42] sins and my sins onto the enemy and the
[56:45] devil is now responsible for your past
[56:47] sins that's under the blood of jesus
[56:51] that's something to shout about
[56:53] you're no longer responsible for it
[56:55] what's under the blood and what's gone
[56:57] is now attributed
[57:00] to the devil
[57:01] that makes me happy
[57:03] that makes satan mad but that makes me
[57:05] happy
[57:08] so everything that jesus died for
[57:09] becomes your personal property you
[57:12] didn't pay for it
[57:13] he paid for it but yet
[57:15] it belongs to you
[57:18] he paid the full price because we
[57:20] couldn't pay the price
[57:22] we couldn't afford redemption
[57:24] we couldn't afford the blessings of god
[57:27] but he paid the full price and because
[57:29] he's now our boaz he then gives it to
[57:32] his family you don't have to pay for it
[57:34] anymore it's already paid for
[57:37] you see david and abraham and boaz they
[57:39] paid full price for things
[57:42] but their families were then assured
[57:43] abraham's the rest of this family was
[57:45] bit was able to be buried in there at no
[57:48] cost because abraham already paid full
[57:51] price for it there was no question on
[57:53] what what happens if all of a sudden
[57:55] somebody comes and tries to take it back
[57:56] abraham had the title deed to that piece
[57:58] of property that everyone that was
[58:01] buried there had a right to be buried
[58:03] there
[58:04] and that is why that was in a
[58:05] geographical location but we now bury
[58:08] saints in christ jesus which is a
[58:11] spiritual because we know that when he
[58:14] raises or he rose from the dead but we
[58:16] know at his coming they're going to
[58:17] raise from the dead because he holds the
[58:20] title deed to life
[58:23] he holds the title deed to resurrection
[58:25] he paid for it so everything that's in
[58:27] here
[58:29] is yours
[58:31] like you hear salvation is free it is
[58:33] for you
[58:35] but it wasn't free for him
[58:38] he paid dearly for it
[58:41] but see you paid just like we you know
[58:43] we have to as as husbands and as as
[58:46] as fathers and mothers you have to pay
[58:49] for things for your family
[58:51] but when your children are living with
[58:53] you they live there for free
[58:58] until they get to a certain age
[59:00] right
[59:01] but but generally and then people have
[59:02] their own ways but generally i'm trying
[59:03] to say is that little children live
[59:05] there for free
[59:06] now that house that that you live in
[59:08] brother bob was not free
[59:11] unless you got a better deal than i did
[59:13] it wasn't free but yet
[59:15] to zoe and to kaylee they're not aware
[59:18] of the cost they they live there because
[59:20] their dad paid the price
[59:24] whether it was easy to pay the mortgage
[59:25] or hard to pay the mortgage he paid the
[59:27] price
[59:29] and so they enjoy the benefits they
[59:31] enjoy the shelter they enjoy things
[59:33] you see now that is just we know a
[59:35] natural
[59:36] comparison to spiritual things
[59:39] all these things you remember he talked
[59:41] about if you tell me to make yourself at
[59:43] home you go open the fridge you go lay
[59:45] down on the couch
[59:46] that's why he preached doors to the
[59:48] heart is because jesus because some
[59:49] people try to just open just a little
[59:50] bitty door and you can only go here you
[59:53] know you have it roped off you sometimes
[59:54] go in these old houses or museums and
[59:55] they've got private access personnel
[59:58] only you know whatever you can only go
[1:00:00] through certain areas but whenever
[1:00:03] counting the cost we want to make a full
[1:00:05] surrender we don't just want him to be
[1:00:06] our savior we want it to be our healer
[1:00:08] our deliverer we want him to be our god
[1:00:13] now many people in history have died
[1:00:15] slow and grueling deaths
[1:00:18] but you know one of the most grueling
[1:00:19] the most grueling part about jesus's
[1:00:21] death was your sins and my sins on him
[1:00:24] jesus died of a broken heart
[1:00:28] because once he lived and he died but
[1:00:30] when he resurrected that enabled him to
[1:00:32] send the holy ghost back to you without
[1:00:34] her that's how you know that he rose
[1:00:35] from the dead is because you have the
[1:00:37] holy ghost
[1:00:38] without the holy ghost you really don't
[1:00:40] know
[1:00:41] but whenever you meet him face to face
[1:00:44] in the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:00:46] and you don't have to see him it's
[1:00:47] called face to face as an expression but
[1:00:50] you know it
[1:00:52] and let me tell you something young
[1:00:53] people or you know my brothers and
[1:00:55] sisters whenever you really really meet
[1:00:57] him there's no denying that you met him
[1:00:59] there's no denying to yourself wherever
[1:01:01] you may be you could be in your bedroom
[1:01:03] you can be in church and you can be
[1:01:04] praying and when he comes by there's
[1:01:07] literally no denying you may not be able
[1:01:09] to see but you know that he's there
[1:01:13] and you know that god is having a
[1:01:14] conference with you and you know that
[1:01:16] you're it's your time now people it's
[1:01:18] important that we take the opportunities
[1:01:20] that we have
[1:01:21] because many times that god is so
[1:01:23] willing
[1:01:24] he's so willing and full of grace and
[1:01:26] compassion and he'll come and he'll try
[1:01:28] and he'll come and reach out and call on
[1:01:30] people but then you have got to make a
[1:01:32] full surrender and don't draw back
[1:01:35] god is willing so when you make a full
[1:01:37] surrender you're certain that you met
[1:01:40] jesus christ in the power of his
[1:01:41] resurrection and then once that life
[1:01:43] enters into you then your brothers and
[1:01:45] sisters in your local assembly can then
[1:01:47] see the change as well
[1:01:50] because it's life
[1:01:53] and don't get all confused and worried
[1:01:56] and get complexes that you got to just
[1:01:57] become so spiritually mature overnight
[1:02:00] it's a growth process
[1:02:02] but at least you're born
[1:02:06] well as soon as soon you know i
[1:02:08] mentioned
[1:02:09] our baby on the way as soon as he's born
[1:02:12] he's in the family
[1:02:14] he gets the protection he gets the love
[1:02:17] he gets the shelter he gets everything
[1:02:19] the other ones get
[1:02:22] but they now he won't be able to
[1:02:25] do the responsible things that others do
[1:02:28] but he's in the family
[1:02:31] and then it's time to eat and then it's
[1:02:32] time to grow and as as these different
[1:02:34] brothers get up and they preach the
[1:02:36] unadulterated word to you you eat you
[1:02:38] feast and you grow
[1:02:40] but you have to eat
[1:02:42] you've got to but it's all based on love
[1:02:46] it's all based on love
[1:02:50] because we know that jesus was a type of
[1:02:51] that scapegoat in the old testament
[1:02:54] when the priests would they'd have two
[1:02:56] goats one would go free and he the one
[1:02:57] that transferred the sins of the entire
[1:03:00] entire nation of israel onto a goat and
[1:03:02] let him go in the wilderness that's what
[1:03:04] that's what he did for us
[1:03:07] my goodness you know
[1:03:08] we can never praise him enough
[1:03:11] you can never never worship him enough
[1:03:14] you can never say thank you enough
[1:03:16] we'll never on the other side we will
[1:03:19] never
[1:03:20] quit worshipping him it'll never just
[1:03:22] get yeah we we've been here a couple
[1:03:24] million years and yeah jesus saved us
[1:03:28] oh no
[1:03:31] the difference is you can get tired here
[1:03:33] you get worn out or you know the light
[1:03:35] may just go out of you or you get over
[1:03:36] there it just goes on and on and on and
[1:03:39] on because he's so worthy
[1:03:42] and in his flesh and in his body he
[1:03:44] leaves the memorials in his hands
[1:03:48] and in his side or when he's speaking or
[1:03:51] he or he he's talking to you and and you
[1:03:53] know you're gonna get think of this
[1:03:55] you're going to get a personal audience
[1:03:57] with jesus christ
[1:04:03] people of the world
[1:04:05] they may line up to have an interview
[1:04:06] with the president
[1:04:08] or with this politician or with this
[1:04:10] earthly king but you're gonna get a one
[1:04:14] on one
[1:04:16] meeting
[1:04:17] with him
[1:04:19] and you you know thank god there's no
[1:04:21] time
[1:04:22] you don't have to be antsy oh you know i
[1:04:25] wish they'd hurry up there won't be that
[1:04:26] you'll be back there praising them
[1:04:29] but when it's your time
[1:04:32] you take all the time
[1:04:36] because he's done so much for us
[1:04:40] he's done so much for us
[1:04:42] that is why that blessed him says when
[1:04:44] we've been there ten thousand years
[1:04:48] it's as if we just begun
[1:04:51] amen
[1:04:52] because in his presence there's fullness
[1:04:54] of joy
[1:04:57] in his presence if you have a difficult
[1:05:00] time
[1:05:01] expressing worship and thanksgiving
[1:05:02] everybody has got a different way of
[1:05:04] worshiping
[1:05:05] everyone has a different way of
[1:05:07] expressing their love
[1:05:09] but if you have a difficult time telling
[1:05:11] the lord thank you telling the lord i
[1:05:14] love you and worshiping him from your
[1:05:16] heart then you should check your
[1:05:17] experience because out out of the
[1:05:20] abundance of the heart the mouth
[1:05:22] speaketh
[1:05:23] and i'm not saying that you should be
[1:05:25] running around the church every server
[1:05:26] so that you should be speaking i'm not
[1:05:27] trying to set it as any evidence and i'm
[1:05:29] not trying to pump anybody up i'm just
[1:05:31] making it as a statement there can be
[1:05:33] the bible even says that they bowed
[1:05:35] their heads and they worship you don't
[1:05:36] have to say a word but you're worshiping
[1:05:38] god the glory of lord the glory of god
[1:05:40] is fallen on you in the service
[1:05:42] baptizing you with the holy ghost
[1:05:44] and no one else can be aware of it your
[1:05:46] neighbor's not aware of it
[1:05:49] but yet the presence of god is falling
[1:05:51] on you because you are in an atmosphere
[1:05:53] of worship
[1:05:55] you know i was fellowshipping with
[1:05:56] brother bob and i'm gonna have to to
[1:05:58] bring this here to a landing
[1:06:00] and maybe pick it up this afternoon
[1:06:02] but
[1:06:03] when you think about worship
[1:06:06] as the word is going forth
[1:06:09] and it's bouncing off of your souls or
[1:06:12] coming into you not bouncing off as it's
[1:06:15] coming into you and you're analyzing and
[1:06:17] you hear the brother preach about
[1:06:19] predestination you you hear the brother
[1:06:22] preach about the love of god you hear
[1:06:23] the brother preach about healing you
[1:06:25] hear whatever it is the word
[1:06:27] you then begin to think back
[1:06:30] he's preaching about healing man i
[1:06:31] remember i used to be sick the doctor
[1:06:33] said i was incurable i used to have this
[1:06:35] condition i used to have that condition
[1:06:36] but i don't anymore
[1:06:38] the brother is preaching about salvation
[1:06:40] man i remember when i was an absolute
[1:06:43] punk
[1:06:46] now i'm not that way anymore
[1:06:48] you know maybe maybe they're preaching
[1:06:50] about predestination you think about
[1:06:51] your family history and how maybe you
[1:06:52] just came from you know the prophet
[1:06:54] himself kept being ashamed of of the
[1:06:56] lineage he came from the bootleggers and
[1:06:58] the branhams he was ashamed of that
[1:07:00] but yet whenever he began to think and
[1:07:03] realize that he in fact and brother bob
[1:07:06] dealt with this a little bit this
[1:07:07] morning but whenever he in fact wasn't
[1:07:09] the son of charles and ella branham once
[1:07:11] he realized that
[1:07:13] that then that then gave him a new look
[1:07:15] on life
[1:07:17] so speaking back to worship as the word
[1:07:20] goes forth and you realize and you think
[1:07:22] and their salvation is being preached or
[1:07:24] predestination man i used to be but god
[1:07:26] brought me through then the word should
[1:07:29] bring forth a worship and you know
[1:07:31] whenever you're worshiping god you're
[1:07:33] then saying thank you lord
[1:07:35] you know he's preaching about
[1:07:36] predestination and i come from such a
[1:07:39] lineage of and we all did i don't care
[1:07:41] if if queen elizabeth is your
[1:07:43] great-grandmother or whatever you know
[1:07:44] you still you still come to our lineage
[1:07:46] is no good but there's no telling what's
[1:07:48] off our back and and the sin and the
[1:07:51] debauchery
[1:07:53] but yet as as as the word begins to go
[1:07:55] forth about predestination you begin to
[1:07:57] realize god i came from this my
[1:07:59] grandparents were this way my own
[1:08:01] parents are this way or whatever may be
[1:08:03] and then it begins to give you a worship
[1:08:05] lord i'm the only believer in my family
[1:08:07] but then it begins to give you a worship
[1:08:09] as the word comes forth you identify
[1:08:12] yourself with that word
[1:08:14] that then becomes true worship that lord
[1:08:17] i used to be a scoundrel but
[1:08:20] because as his brother is preaching it
[1:08:22] begins to water
[1:08:24] the the change that god has done in your
[1:08:26] life i'm not that way anymore so then it
[1:08:29] begins to bring forth a worship and that
[1:08:32] kind of worship is very pleasing unto
[1:08:35] the lord it's not put on it's not so
[1:08:38] so-and-so sees you it's not because the
[1:08:39] camera sees you or whatever it may be
[1:08:42] it's because it comes from the heart and
[1:08:44] you worship god as a way of thanksgiving
[1:08:48] we all have something to worship god for
[1:08:52] if
[1:08:52] just the fact that we're here breathing
[1:08:55] just the fact that we're here living and
[1:08:56] that we're under this word is enough to
[1:08:59] praise him from now until forever
[1:09:02] amen there's worship and god looks for
[1:09:05] those jesus said
[1:09:08] to worship him in spirit and in truth
[1:09:12] this word
[1:09:14] is worth
[1:09:16] selling out to
[1:09:18] this word is worth everything get rid of
[1:09:21] everything else that's of lesser value
[1:09:25] and just attain
[1:09:27] this great pearl
[1:09:28] we found this great pearl you've heard
[1:09:30] about this pearl at this church alone
[1:09:33] for decades
[1:09:36] every
[1:09:37] sunday and every wednesday that pearl is
[1:09:39] just shine
[1:09:41] look at this church
[1:09:43] look how beautiful this pearl is
[1:09:45] turn it this way and then and then you
[1:09:47] know brother gets up here and he he
[1:09:48] shines it real good and then one of the
[1:09:50] other brothers get up behind him on the
[1:09:51] next service and they turn that pearl a
[1:09:53] little bit more they say look at this
[1:09:55] and it glistens and it all works
[1:09:57] together it's a fivefold working
[1:09:58] together
[1:10:00] to bring about and to magnify the lord
[1:10:03] jesus christ this pearl of great price
[1:10:06] it's all the same word
[1:10:09] and it magnifies and it just it just
[1:10:12] turns the diamond or maybe turns the
[1:10:14] pearl at a different angle but that
[1:10:15] pearl of great price is so beautiful
[1:10:18] everything else is worth selling out for
[1:10:20] and as we close this morning if there's
[1:10:22] anything
[1:10:23] in our lives that would keep us from
[1:10:26] making a full committal if we still have
[1:10:28] some doors that are locked if we have
[1:10:30] some little no trespassing or maybe we
[1:10:31] have some ribbon and we want jesus in
[1:10:33] just this area of our lives maybe we
[1:10:35] want him you know in in our relationship
[1:10:37] maybe we want him in our finances maybe
[1:10:38] we want him here or there but it's not
[1:10:40] fully
[1:10:42] open
[1:10:43] to where lord jesus come into my heart
[1:10:45] and if you see anything if you like
[1:10:47] anything if there's anything i can give
[1:10:49] you if there's a talent that i have
[1:10:52] if there's if if i can sing
[1:10:54] if i if i can and you don't have to just
[1:10:56] sing like like you don't even have to
[1:10:58] have talent just make a joyful noise to
[1:10:59] the lord but if there's something that
[1:11:00] you can use lord
[1:11:03] take it
[1:11:05] if you can take my hands and play an
[1:11:06] instrument take it lord
[1:11:08] you see it laying on the table maybe you
[1:11:10] know maybe if you see that that my feet
[1:11:13] stay at home too much and maybe you know
[1:11:15] you don't i don't go to the house of god
[1:11:16] like i should or maybe my feet stay home
[1:11:18] or i don't i don't pray enough take them
[1:11:21] and use it
[1:11:23] take my hands and use them for your
[1:11:25] kingdom maybe they're just laying laying
[1:11:26] around but use them lord if you see
[1:11:29] anything
[1:11:31] because remember the prophet typed the
[1:11:32] queen or somebody coming and they seen
[1:11:34] something that she wanted and how you
[1:11:36] would just give it to her
[1:11:39] that is a very very profound sermon
[1:11:41] we want to give it all because he did
[1:11:45] he paid the full price the brother tells
[1:11:47] us that he would even bankrupt
[1:11:50] all of heaven amen
[1:11:52] you think about that he would bankrupt
[1:11:54] all of heaven
[1:11:55] to make sure that his word don't fall to
[1:11:57] the ground
[1:11:58] so get that checkbook this morning
[1:12:00] we all have things to write out for
[1:12:03] we all had things right for and he paid
[1:12:05] for it
[1:12:08] it's free to us the only thing that he
[1:12:10] requires is faith
[1:12:12] it's like a receipt to prove
[1:12:15] when the check when you hand the check
[1:12:16] in a lot of times you get a deposit slit
[1:12:18] to prove it's been deposited
[1:12:20] and that's what you have to hold on to
[1:12:21] so if you deposit a thousand dollars to
[1:12:24] cover
[1:12:24] the rent
[1:12:26] 2 000 to cover your mortgage or whatever
[1:12:28] you've got the proof that okay i just
[1:12:30] deposited my paycheck so when i write a
[1:12:32] check for my mortgage
[1:12:34] i can be confident that one will cover
[1:12:36] the other because they confirmed to me
[1:12:39] that the money is in the bank
[1:12:43] so whenever you write out the check to
[1:12:44] the bank of heaven
[1:12:46] you have your faith you have the token
[1:12:48] to show that what you requested
[1:12:51] has been sent in to the bank of heaven
[1:12:55] and it will be honored
[1:12:58] if you've got faith there's no such
[1:12:59] thing as bounce checks in heaven
[1:13:02] there's no such thing
[1:13:04] he paid the full price so you could go
[1:13:06] free
[1:13:07] brother tells us the story about that
[1:13:09] crow
[1:13:10] i think it was johnny crow i forget
[1:13:12] exactly what he what he called him
[1:13:14] how he was free and that farmer tied him
[1:13:16] to that stake and then one day he was
[1:13:17] let loose but he still thought he was
[1:13:19] still tied
[1:13:22] and that's what this world is full of is
[1:13:24] poor souls
[1:13:27] that are in bondage
[1:13:29] but there's been a way made
[1:13:31] but they've got to come through that way
[1:13:34] amen god bless you let's stand to our
[1:13:36] feet
[1:13:38] let's go to the lord in prayer do you
[1:13:40] love the lord this morning
[1:13:46] the gracious heavenly father lord we
[1:13:47] thank you father lord for this day thank
[1:13:49] you lord for your people here thank you
[1:13:52] lord for the opportunity lord that we
[1:13:53] can have and and share your word father
[1:13:55] with people that believe and are hungry
[1:13:57] for the word of god
[1:13:58] lord thank you most of all for you
[1:14:00] father that has made that the reason
[1:14:02] that this church is even here the reason
[1:14:03] that i'm even here the reason that any
[1:14:04] of us are even here is because you went
[1:14:06] all the way
[1:14:08] we thank you lord jesus for all your
[1:14:09] blessings lord we worship you father we
[1:14:12] don't want to just worship you with our
[1:14:13] lips we don't want to just worship you
[1:14:14] father lord
[1:14:16] in other ways but lord we we want to
[1:14:17] worship you that way but we want to
[1:14:18] worship you with our whole lives may our
[1:14:20] whole lives be worshipped unto you
[1:14:23] father how we love you how we appreciate
[1:14:26] you lord we want to tell you from the
[1:14:28] bottom of our hearts lord how much we
[1:14:29] thank you father lord that you pay the
[1:14:31] full price that you went all the way
[1:14:33] lord we can only imagine we can't fully
[1:14:36] understand but we can't we can imagine
[1:14:38] how difficult it must have been but yet
[1:14:40] you submitted yourself to your own word
[1:14:43] and you went all the way and for that
[1:14:45] father we thank you for that we love you
[1:14:49] for that we we surrender our lives to
[1:14:51] you unreservedly and father lord if
[1:14:54] there's any of us here lord that i've
[1:14:55] had any door locked whatsoever we unlock
[1:14:59] it now in the name of jesus and unlock
[1:15:01] it
