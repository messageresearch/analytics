TRANSCRIPT
========================================
now just for a moment let's review the first seal the first seal I got it written right here cuz we're going to take the characteristics of each seal and then we're going to see how they all tie together cuz listen we can't get away whatever the seals reveal whatever great mystery that the seals reveal it is no more than the foundation of justification baptism of the Holy Ghost you can't get away from that why would a prophet go to the Future home which is after the seals broke preach us preach that that message was in eternity because it all was in the future home and that's all in eternity it wasn't the Millennium it was the future home that's eternity the Millennium is not Eternity for the world and some of the people now it is for us but we're backing it way back up here and we're Eternal right now I'm telling you we got to know something that's going on that the world knows nothing about that they're they're all looking for a Superman or a super race let's he God in human flesh again what in the world do you want more than that right it's just the world can't see it because we're common people and we just like I told you Jesus was so common they called him a wine biver bbub a glutton he was always eating with Sinners and prostitutes and you know I mean but that was God Almighty in human flesh uh they they watched him get a little angry one day and really said oh well he's nothing he's son of Joseph that's Joseph's boy look at him he's acting like a human well he was so much human till uh he hid himself but he was all of God he wasn't just so much God he was God yes so that's the way that's what I was we were talking about the Bible study and I said you know last Sunday I think we're all looking for sinless Perfection we're not going to get sinless Perfection like people think we're going to get I don't think so I I just don't see it I don't I didn't see it in Jesus look he got worse as far as in his body form he got worse heading toward Calvary people rejected him they threw things at him they they drove him out of here they in other words he was rejected more at the end of his message look at brother bham same identical way I know some of you weren't around but the first sermon I preached was was about um brother Bram and Jesus thear between them in November of 19 98 I believe it was everybody thought I was talking about brother Brandon but I was talking about Jesus I brought him all through his life and never said a word about who it was about a light came at his birth and all this and coming down through there well what came in Jesus's birth a life I mean everybody was thinking you know well he's he's talking about brother Brown's life and all I talking about the life of Jesus they were so together though that uh most of us I say most of us were born and there wasn't a light the only light we saw was the light above the you know in the room we didn't see a supernatural light you understand what I mean because that wasn't our calling but if we had been able to see in the other dimension you'd be able to see a light because you know what brother Brown told us he said you were given an angel at Birth what is an Angel that's your that's light I mean you're giv an angel at Birth to to keep you through uh through all the perils and things of Life why are we still here because the grace of God we have a if you're still alive and remain then you can put yourself in that scripture we which are alive and remain right okay and if we do happen to go on then we're the ones that's that's waiting for the ones that are alive and remain so you know we're all connected together but I truly believe that we're looking at a I don't think we see spiritual enough because it's like all this come up with with Hillary and and uh and Trump I knew she wasn't going to win I told a lot of y'all she's not going to win right I told you she wasn't going to win I told you why cuz she's weak nobody would have got behind her but you watch and see somebody's got a B cuz look you see that word now that does not the Beast there but there's got to there's a beast system in Revelations 13 and they have to have someone to speak for that Beast right and brother brandham clearly said Revelations 13 was the United States of America well we're so weak militarily now and economically till the world just laughs at us yeah we got to have somebody that's going to build it up what the first thing Trump said he said I'm going to add 500,000 troops okay where they going they're going over there you know where they're going they're going to Syria they're going right over there where Russ is at you see how all this is coming together I don't believe that that Clinton would have done that but obviously not cuz he's the one that's going to call the shots for the next four years anyway so uh the woman's already been in the White House you know look outside please people just look outside right women rule this country yes they do women rules this country everything is a woman um look at the men they're beginning to act like women yeah yeah that's true I told y'all before I said look the Bible says in that in in what is it Luke 17:30 as it was in Sodom and Gomorrah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man we never had sure we had a lot of sodomy and all that stuff going on before but now it's legal that's why people went to Sodom and gomor that's right it's because it was legalized in Sodom and Gomorrah that's why they all went there it hasn't been legal in the United States until the stinking people did it you know the Supreme Court did it and said it was legal yeah okay so now it's word modern modern Sodom and gomorra right now the revelation of the son of man can come though you say well that's the Bleak part the good part is the Bible says when that happen the son of man is going to be made known right so that all those things are uh are it's heading up I'm telling you it's getting real close it's heading up oh yeah we're uh we're we're seeing all this absolutely fulfilled before our eyes every day yes every day it's all just going to be a culmination of what's going on okay so just realize one thing you know everybody you know a lot of people I'm like teren said I'd like to know what the message preachers were preaching before talking about Hillary coming in and then now what they say cuz see they thought prophecy listen how many times have we went through a prophecy brother Brown many times he said that's already been fulfilled that's right we didn't even know it I mean he's brought that prophecy and he said sun and the moon turn the blood I was reading it the other day he said that's already happened and he said you Pentecostal you're looking for some great Revival already happened man has always remember what brother brother Brown said he said man's looking back looking forward you see now everybody's looking four years from now to bring up a woman president and hey you know what that may be fine but I hope we're gone by then cuz 2019 is the election year 2020 is election year yeah so I hope we're out of here by then and you know what if it gets it's bad it's supposed to be right so it's supposed to be but some somebody had to come in and lift this thing up because you know what if we fall as a nation you know if you fall from here to here it's not going to hurt you right but if you get up that roof and you fall it's going to hurt you when you hit the ground so we got to get built back up so that this thing can just absolutely fold up and crash and it's going to that's right just a few years just watch it's not going to be not going to be very long but let's get these seals and let's get did let's get sealed in brother L sent me a message last night he said he's been preaching on U sealed unto the day of your Redemption he said boy he said they've been rejoicing over and I said that's good buddy that's good he's been preaching for a brother in Canada while he's up there so uh pray for the Christine's mother not doing well at all um just a few few weeks if the Lord don't intervene maybe even a few days but the dad he's been witnessing salvation to the dad so said he's really opening up and coming around I talked to him or text him last night and uh that's what he told me so so that's uh he he misses us and we miss him I know it's real taxing they're not going to come back till probably the 26th of November so they're going to be gone for a while so just uh pray for them for their finances and all too because man that's a drain on you if you don't work for a couple two three weeks um but the Lord knows all things he works this thing out man he's he knew it for the foundation of the world that's right all right now let's go into the second now the first seal let's cover the first seal the Beast was what the lion l i o n lion all right and we saw the revelation of one God because if you see the mystery of iniquity it doesn't become a mystery anymore it becomes a revelation amen it's a revelation of one true God because what's the first thing they attacked at n the first thing Satan kept attacking even down here with with u with irenius and that man named shus right corinthus right after Jesus died it wasn't very long after Jesus's death he started saying well no Jesus wasn't God Jesus was just a like substance well see that was a saying and that the first seal when Satan goes out it's a saying you start talking about things you start well then with the people don't cut it off it builds to what a deed people start doing it then it becomes a Doctrine all right well we haven't got to the doctrine stage yet because it's got when it becomes a Doctrine see our doctrine of this church is what we are this body of doctrine of church is what we are when we go out there we take the doctrine of this church okay all right so see how important it is to be under the right Doctrine right okay all right and be under a doctrine that can't be unraveled or can't be um uh it can be question yes but it can't be refuted that's right and broke down all right so the first seal if we're going to go by what the prophet of God said when he went to Future home he said I've taught three stages of Grace or three stages of the of the new birth from the beginning and I've never stopped since because the world goes through remember it went through justification and what Noah what baptism Noah know your message what a baptism with Noah then it went through sanctification under what Calvary Jesus dying at the cross shedding his red blood all right and then upon his death burial and resurrection and Ascension he brought back what the Holy Ghost okay you say brother you got you got um white red and black that black but that black ain't bad when you're dead that Black's not bad when you're dead you got to die that's our problem there's too much of us still alive right we got to die so that Christ can what come alive in our life Christ had to die death black to release his life and then you say what about the pale justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost and the word made flesh when Jesus came out out of the Tomb he sure he was a word made flesh but his body was what glorified those who he is Justified he's already glorified so that's 6 months down the road we'll get to that in a little while but each seal see this is this is what I most people in the message and I'll tell you a little story in a minute most people in the message take the seals and they go oh it's all about the Antichrist it's all negative if it's for the Redemption of your body it can't be negative right it's got to be positive somewhere you got to get the positive aspect of this how you going to get your body changed knowing that the that the Pale Horse was the devil and all the powers wrapped together it don't change nothing yeah but when you come up through the same stages that Jesus went through and you come to that what is the Pale Horse what is the word made flesh it's justification sanctification and the Holy Ghost all in one I preached this down at somebody a church in in Florida I had a couple of ministers come up afterwards and they it was two nights that we had preached it Mama dad was there I think and uh they said brother we ain't never heard nobody preach that this was you know under this was all under justification think this was all under what uh we get we thought it was just the revelation of the devil it is a revelation but of the devil but if it reveals him riding away from you then what have you become listen you can't be the word made flesh Jesus was John 1:14 right and the Word was made flesh right he had no sin right that's the reason he could be the word made flesh we've got to remember though that this came part of sin right it's like we were talking in the Bible study Jesus came into this world knowing where he came from because he had no sin he had no sin barrier he could look back and say before Abraham was I am now he was a liar if he wasn't that but now you and I can't say that in the form he said it that's right right but once we do come to a revelation of who we are we can say I came from God and I go back to God cuz that's exactly what happen what it's doing it's breaking the scales back from our eyes breaking into a revelation that man does not know anything about cuz Jesus was the word made flesh I thought you and I had to be the word made flesh said well we yeah we've got this little sticker called the flesh that's what these seals are to do is to show not just this is this this justification is not just baby form justification when I say baby form that means when somebody comes in um uh let's just anybody anybody that's new here at the church if you come in and sit down and you ask God to forgive you your sins to me that's what we call baby form justification because that is a baby you're still you still have sin but you are Justified right there God forgives you of your past sins and never can bring that up again but now the next day you keep sinning the next day you keep doing the same thing why because the Holy Ghost hadn't done a work of sanctification in your life that's why I believe in those three works of Grace if you don't go through them and don't know you went through them then you just don't have them you bir I'm sorry you just you got and you can't you don't have to put it on a day or a date M because remember it's a process but one day you come to a realization that man you clean me up see see that's the that's the problem most people have cuz we got to talk about New Birth we should have talked about it before but I'm going to talk about it now people in the message and most 99.9% of the people in the world go through a state of justification sure listen if the Bible doesn't say if you're in the message and you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ Thou shalt be saved no the Bible says if you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ Thou shalt be saved now if you die you are saved but you're not bride okay cuz you're not Sanctified you're not cleansed all right God has just picked the glass up that was dirty and nasty but it's still dirty and nasty we must go through the process of sanctification when now now everybody even the Pentecostals most people in the message and most people in the world if they go through a great work of sanctification which means god cleans up cuz see most people say well I know I'm born again cuz I quit smoking I quit drinking I quit gambling that ain't got nothing to do with in New Birth nothing a't got nothing to do in New Birth why Judas did the same thing Judas was so Sanctified he was so close to those disciples that were ready to receive the new birth he was so close to them so they did not know who he was really know who he was and what he was doing they had no clue even right up to the time of of spping in the bowl they had no idea because he was so close but the other ones went on to Pentecost and received they baptism of the Holy Ghost in their soul which burned out died killed that old nature right and God came live done but most people in the message say I quit this and this and this that's good but that's only a state of sanctification I mean if you're still smoking drinking cussing running around I Ain say about bad thoughts I had one other day I thought where in the world that come from well I knew who it come from but why did it come at that moment you know and even brother Danny steaman he made a good point he said you know he said I was praying for somebody one night and he said this evil nasty filthy thought came right through my head that's right and he said I stopped and he he said God you know that what didn't come from me and he continued play praying for the people but it we're human that's the human part go God took this the devil took this if we keep it up here he can play that's right but put it down here and he can't get that's what these seals for remember brother R was talking about the third pull right what is it the first and second the first and second justification and sanctification can be copied but the new birth cannot be copied if you have the real baptism of the Holy Ghost Satan cannot get in your soul he cannot do anything you are absolutely uh like I said I'm still working I'm trying to C cut it down to an hour on the dimensions but your soul is actually in another dimension right where' it come from where did the New Birth come from this Dimension NOP Come From Another Dimension it came into this Dimension and baptize you that's why Paul could say him being a prophet he knew Dimensions he said we're now sitting in Heavenly places right well he's a liar if we're not that's right right we got to go back to the Bible and say well now Paul's lying if we're if that's not what's happening that's right that's right he said we're sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen Romans 8:1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the Flesh in other words don't look at this but after the spirit now we don't start realiz that's why I said I got a revelation the other day hadn't had one in a long long time honestly but when Jesus said the works I do so you do also now how many we read we read that now you say well that's okay you got to get a revelation to that right right cuz the works I do that shall you do also he's lying if we're not going to do the same Works he did right not one person but any many membered body you got to find your place find what you're doing find what you're doing on this Earth M and that's where you're sitting in Heavenly places Satan cannot sit in that place that's right I don't believe Satan can go to the seventh Dimension or the sixth Dimension now five and four 3 2 and one he can run all up and down but now that is preserved for the baptism of the Holy Ghost cuz look Satan can't get in there right he can't get in that sixth Dimension he can't get in the seventh Dimension you say well he talks to God God has to step out to another place you say well Satan's in heaven he's in another dimension okay talking to God but I don't believe he's in that seventh Dimension cuz there's where our future home is right our future home's in that seventh Dimension and it's going to come here six is going to empty up we're going to just step over another dimension God's going to wipe this off and we're going to bring them all back to here right what a mighty God we serve What a Mighty Prophet that could go and tell us all these things and it not be a fable now if he's telling a lie he's a liar but he's not he's telling the truth just like Paul told the truth he's telling us the truth of what's going to happen yes just like all this is happening now all these systems and everything is all political is just rotten into the core and all you know so we just got to we just got to be Christians d right we're if we're Christians then we're you know hide us in your Pavilion so in there in the book of Psalms that's kind of odd that brother Brandon preached a Rapture and he took that scripture hide me in your Pavilion okay you'll understand that maybe in a little while all right let's go the first seal it's the lion of the tribe of Judah the lion to me it shows justification why cuz you're just you're just that's right when you come to the SE revelation of the seals it's not as you if you didn't do it see as if you didn't do it means you did it but there's no record of it when you come to true when you come to a true knowledge that your soul never did any of those things that's not baby form justification that's your highest form of justification that the real you never did it to begin with all right that's what we must come to it because if we don't we're going to be just like everybody else you know Jesus is the same way Jesus didn't have to get up every morning thank God I mean i' I'd love to been in his brain where you don't remember though I mean we Satan reminds us of our sin all the time even what we done 30 40 years ago drive right by a place or go by something and it spark your memory of all that I wish it would be gone but listen God knows that right God knows that and he made a provision God forgive me and go on don't just set what our problem is is we what Satan wants us to stop brother rown said a Christian should never stop that's right what we do is is we stop and let that bird start growing that Nest again right but the best thing to do is is just keep going on um had a thought the other day of some of my past and I just started singing only believe boy the devil don't like that so he just leave he just left he just went just sing only believe all things are possible in after one brother said the angel love is it only believer I love him only believe well I believe if you sing it what what did David do David played that harp and sang and saw the Bible say here we go back to the Bible the Bible says the evil spirits left off you so I can't sing it didn't saying that it said make a joy for North that's right and when so there's your first seal one true and living God because the Revelation 1 through Living God is is that Jesus was almighty God in human flesh and there is an impostor called the devil and he is that mystery of iniquity right all right but if you see a true revelation of one God you can't see a true revelation of one God unless you truly are Justified Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost okay because the Devils believe in one God the Bible says the Devils believe in one God and tremble right so I believe in one God so do the devil he knew it before you did that's that's what's so bad is he come down here and split him up in three and he always knew he was one that's right cuz remember it was God created Satan and then there wasn't a whole lot left okay he could talk to him right there you know he that was it wasn't three sitting on a throne that's right but you know what Satan done he just perverted what God said he just took and twisted it and said oh let's make him three Satan's want to be one of them three what he want to be you know if Satan can tear God down then what does he do he elevates himself that's right right so these seals are truly to show The Works of the devil but it's truly the underline between the line is showing you and I that he has no power unless we give it to him amen cuz power was given given given that's right given power was given all right who give Satan power we do cuz remember Satan's still going to be alive and he's going to be on all these horses even in the Millennium the Millennium doesn't kill that's what you got to get the story right in the Millennium this is an atomic blast that's going to blow off the world this is not God's fire this is man's fire that's going to destroy man destroy everything we're going to come back into Millennium and I believe we're going to know where this place is at I mean the buildings are still going to be here because remember he's not going to wipe it off yet right right that's right so Satan is just bound why he has no one to ride with on we have no he has no power see because remember unless we give him the power he has none that's right okay that's why I say I love that scripture says is this the man you look on the side of the road and see a drunk laying there you know all beat up and you know stinking and rotten you look down and say is this the man that that ruined Nations that's the way we're going to look at the Devil once he's defeated in this and we get our we take on the mind of Christ we're going to look at Satan and say man I can't believe that little wimp rule my life yeah all that time I just can't I just you know so it's just the way it is all right let's go now so the first Seal white horse rider God had to start out with a white righteous Church through the three Church ages absolutely because they didn't have doctrines we have to deal with now right had a pure church but it what it became um mixed it became from a saying to a deed to a Doctrine and just a little while and when it becomes a Doctrine then a Doctrine is what you are then in other words you've took it in and it becomes a part of your life okay that's why they say you've been indoctrinated okay so the first thing shows a white righteous church but it also a white righteous true church but it also shows the Antichrist so close so he's going to make you think you got the new birth and you really don't that's close that's all right so so not doing the things you used to do is not a truth of the new birth the truth of the new birth is you can sit down and listen to the word of God being preached to you even if it's preached in contention or error okay at least to show you what the are is we've been sitting in many places and I hate that to say many places we've been sitting in several places three or four I can name listen to a preacher preach and everybody else screaming and shouting and and and the whole row of us that from this church just sit there and from another church just sitting there well I'm not going to shout for something I don't believe so what does that matter because something inside there's a bell went off went right and what happens is is the Holy Ghost inside of you he said he'd be your teacher right now now let's just put it this way brother Dale didn't have to jump up and start preaching to that line of people to make us realize why we're sitting there we knew it already problem with those other people was no I eat grits this morning my granny used to eat grits and she'd still have it on her on her lip in way in the evening we your M Mama does that too I was going to say that but uh it's hereditary it's a it's a genetic thing so anyway what was I saying anyway it it you don't have to be told it's already in you those other people I'm not saying they weren't born again because you can you can you can be an error and be born again but you want listen but once truth is presented here's the here's the difference once you present truth to someone with the Holy Ghost they'll immediately turn right cuz they got to agree with the word that's right right that's right not a big church not you know big this and big this and big that we got to go here because it's a big play no it's the word when that word comes and it's presented to you and you turn it down I doubt that you're born again that's true right but now you can go many many years like a lot of those people never really heard the truth or heard heard you know the truth being preached to them so they shout about what they what they a lot of is emotion but they shout about what you know what they think that's what that the preacher say right okay that's why I said you can you can imitate all that but you cannot take a born again believer and put him to where somebody says something in eror and if it don't some little something go just a little click brother Brown said that little nod all they got in First Church ages he said all they got was a little nod from God that's what brother R said he'd wait for that nod but what was a nod the nod from God put you in relationship with God at the at that moment what he needed for that moment and then what' you do that little what does a nod do if I do like that that means you can come or go or whatever you need to do you're asking a question something's happening and you're going I approve of that agreement agreement I agree with that when he nods he's in agreement that you need to go pray for somebody he's in agreement that what that brother's saying is true true or he's in agreement with you that that's not true when you feel that little pun that little just a little you know just feel somewhere that right you ever been driving somewhere tell you how natural it is you ever been driving somewhere and you go I forgot something but R you never done for no yeah you P Kathy bless her heart depend on her she's going down the road she go I know I forgot something right ready right I pick because she ain't here but have you really well you know what that's in your spirit you're forgetting something and most of the time you'll go through a list in your head and you'll go forgot the batteries or forgot the camera or forgot you know something something why that's a natural thing well same thing with the word of God take that times 10 million now because the word of God is always true that's right there's no error in this word amen so if there's no error in this word you ought to what we ought to have done is is rejoiced after everybody sat down and that we should have jumped up and started rejoicing after that God had revealed or kept us from that error that was being preached see I thank God for that sure it hurts my spirit it really does that others don't see it but but when you when you get alone with God you know you go thank you thank you I appreciate that Lord you you you kept me from something well see to me I think that's the Holy Ghost cuz he said he'd lead you and guide you into all truth amen right so to me that's the true nature of having the Holy Ghost is that every time the true words presented you amen it you may not understand it but something inside of you says that's got to be true let me go study this right cuz we can't go up here with brother Dale and different ones and and just say oh that's all right you know everything's right yeah that's I I understand every bit of it no you you don't that's right sheep have to be led but they look to the shepherd and if he leads them the right way they're happy as they can be right but we as humans though we have to reason things this is our problem we reason it in our head okay I know uh one of you sitting in this building right now says when you say I think back it up cuz you don't say I think you got to know at this point in time in our life we must know certain things you understand and not not being derogatory but just you just and I do the same thing I think it ought to be this way well you ain't gone that's right right and like I was telling somebody yesterday I was telling U I was telling brother Joe and brother Nathaniel we were talking about something something happening and by the way brother Joe Green killed his first deer KN eight point buck and Nathaniel killed a dough yesterday morning so they they all got uh not yesterday morning Friday morning they all got game so they took it all back with them and they said tell you all hello so they had a good time we were talking about something and I said you know God's no is the best yes you'll ever get you've heard me say that many times yes when God says no he knows that when you if you you bring a question to him and he says yes this is the way you're going to go and it's going to end up wrong mhm so if he says no or you get that little check not to do something you better listen to it cuz he knows the end of everything that's now listen with your free moral ageny you can go and do it anyway but you know what you going fail but when God says no you better stand right back there and just wait on the answer to me that's being led by the Lord right okay and that's the same thing with these seals brother brand was led of the Lord to bring this message and like I said many times before it hasn't changed a person yet so there's something in that in this message that's got to be Quicken to us to change CH our body because it's here it's there right it's laid out right here it's in books and tape form it's in the Bible it's laid out for us all we got to do is what walk into it and believe it all right let's read this and then we'll we'll go when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see now who is the second beast huh or a beast of burden or you can say a calf because the Bible sometimes in in in one place it says calf but it's a beast of burden what is an ox an ox carries a load it's real slow an ox is not a thoroughbred horse racer no what it takes slow one step at a time one step at a time same way with you and I I've always agreed with brother Dale whole heartly on one point if you see somebody walk in this door and they're on fire with God and they're running down the aisle never running up on top of the tables about 6 months later they gone and it's happened many times just in this church yes it but those that sit down and sit there and look at you and watch and observe and sometimes don't even say a word and but they just keep coming right they just keep coming getting a little bit like brother Joe talking about that um Ruth didn't get didn't get two wagon loads of barley right she got handfuls of purpose she picked it up one handful at a time and put it in her little barley sack little little things if you'll do that and just stay under the water spout you'll get wet enough where God will start revealing things to you and then you're then you're in and you're here and you're settled and you're done I don't mean just here I mean you're I believe to me that's the Born Again experience yes cuz many can come in and do that sh be happy and be like you know house on fire on a windy day but all of a sudden what you present the word somewhere you going to present the word it's going to be right here in front of them they're going to go away from it you know you just can't go somewhere else when you're fed well no you just no but now I don't want to be so narrow-minded to say that this is the only place that you need to go okay no I do not I don't think that's true there's other people that have handfuls of purpose denomination for you do that yeah you're a denomination if you do right brother R I was thinking same thing you're a denomination if you think this is it this is the only place to go we can't listen to nobody else no you need to you need to hey you go get things from people that preach error but if you keep look wanting to go to somewhere that's preaching error you got a problem right right all right so let's read the seal now the first seal like I said the first seal was was typing the first three ages it wasn't in the first three typing the first three ages all right I got that cuz you got you got to give a type okay now this next one the second seal is going to be tiped in this thy Tyrant age which is the age of Columba or thyra and it's the longest age the ox it's going to take him longer to get his job done right the lion Now watch how this is going to move up because the lion ox man and Eagle is what the Holy Ghost right the Lono man and Eagle is the Holy Ghost that's what you if you have the Born Again experience you have all four yes right the boldness of a line that laboring like I was talking about get come to church read your Bible study pray all right the man you got to have some form of intelligence and then the eagle you got to go up higher it's really it's outstanding how God does it where you can see it now a Lon is very powerful right very powerful powerful I mean they can just you know they can bite you and break your bones but they can only see so far because they're only about this tall the biggest line in the world is only about this tall right well if a grass is this tall how far can he see can't see far right Revelation he he he's powerful he can get through all that and do what he needs to do but he's only this tall and he can only see if he's out in the grass of the Plains the stuff this tall you can't see very for it see means to understand but now the oxs you know good old o somebody about this T and when they get to look in they look out over that grass but they can't see past the higher bushes you know up to here right little bit more Revelation but not as much as the next one coming up which is a man we stand up 6t tall but what we do is we take our intelligence and we can climb a ladder and see over the trees but we can't get all the way up unless we're in the eagle that's why this is the eagle age that's the age where the eagle goes up he can fly this way he can see all directions in other words unlimited sight he's only limited by how far he can he just keeps going he just keep seeing further if he keeps going he keeps seeing further he's unlimited by his eyesight so that's the way the Holy Ghost is same thing L ox man an eagle the Holy Ghost was is you you you start out you know like the real power and it is powerful keeps going up a little more you can see a little more and you can see a little more so that's a way that the that's the way that as Satan does his work God's doing his work you can't take these seals and make it just the devil okay these seals is a revelation of Jesus Christ in his people I want to add that and that's not adding to but it's not just revelation of Jesus Christ this is revelation of Jesus Christ in his people cuz you see all these Powers the lonox man and Eagle they're Powers how do they work they work through you they work through you all right same way the devil rides through you in other things all right let's read this seal and then we'll make a couple comments and then we'll leave all right we'll pick this up next Sunday and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast which was the ox say come and see and there went out another horse Satan gets off of that power that power just keeps on going cuz look you can't tell the people here in this age that they're wrong you going to walk in Baptist Church and say hey y'all all wrong no we not wrong okay so that uh White Horse is still riding all right but he gets on another horse that was red and power was given right power was given M to him that sat there on to take PE be from the earth and that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a sword now he didn't have a sword in the in the in the first first seal he had a bow and no arrows he was bluffing the people but now look what he's got he don't have just a sword he's got a great sword now what's a sword always mean in the Bible word so he's given a word now he's he's conquering and conquered with his deception in the first age but that deception has come now into somebody Pope or whatever you want to call it we always say Pope cuz that's the head but he's got all these up under him Baptist methus Pentecostal they're all undering all right and that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword now there was given unto him a word so you got Ox you got now what is a symbol of red blood what is the symbol of blood sanctification so we're heading into now think of the seal under sanctification but now what happened was this is a literal happening because right here in this church age th tyan Church age this was called the Catholic age that's when 68 million your Fox's book of Martyrs went on during this time right where 68 million Christians were killed under the Roman hierarchy killed read killed under the Roman hierarchy by what sure they were literally killed but brother Brown said millions were killed physically but Untold Millions spiritually by that great sword or that great word all right so hang on to that we'll see thank God for the rain yes
