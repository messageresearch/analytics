let's now change the order of service as our brother comes out to preach to us [Music] open the eyes of my heart lord open the eyes of my heart [Music] oh jesus i want to see you open the eyes of my

out your power and love as we sing holy [Music] holy [Music] do you want to see him this afternoon i'm glad to be in the house of the lord sure appreciate that masterpiece of a message this morning a true token that's something we should all be something we should be crying out within our heart for a refilling to get that true true token but this uh this afternoon i just want to take a little topic respect for what god is doing now i think god is doing something now and if we can just uh look at it in the right way and so this afternoon i want to read from the book of psalms chapter 105 verses 1 to 15 and before we go into the to the word let's just go to the author lord god we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word once more lord and we're so grateful for the words that we heard this morning lord and for the lord i believe we've come with our hearts prepared and expecting lord jesus lord we we lord you know the needs of everyone here let's get this gathered this afternoon lord god and i i we know that the word is the desire of the thoughts and intents of the heart lord and lord the words that are laying in my notes and in my heart lord and in the pages of this bible lord you have something prepared for whatever the need of every heartless afternoon lord we just ask lord that you'll feel at liberty to move among us this afternoon lord jesus to speak to our heart to speak to our knees lord to give us what we have need of whether we it's deliverance or healing or little more just more of you lord god and lord surely lord we all need more of you and i believe that in this hour you've given us power lord jesus to overcome everything that the devil is throwing at us you've given the word says that you've given us power to become sons of god you've given us power to enter into a higher revelation of who you are and i pray god that you'll open up the word to us tonight lord jesus this afternoon the lord help us to peer in not with just intellectual understanding lord but with eyes of revelation to see lord jesus who we are in the day and hour that we're living in and how we should be looking at your word grant it now lord god as i ask this blessing upon the reading of your word now psalms chapter 105 says uh think of think of david sitting there crying out to god maybe in his prayer chamber and you know he would he would get inspired and and write these write these songs out that would be sung in the temple and and and so david said oh give thanks unto the lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the people sing unto him sing psalms unto him talk ye of all his wondrous works glory in his holy name let the heart of them rejoice that seek the lord seek the lord and his strength seek his face forevermore remember his marvelous works that he hath done his wonders and the judgments of his mouth o ye seed of abraham is servant you children of jacob has chosen he is the lord our god his judgments are in all the earth he hath remembered his covenant forever the word which he commanded to a thousand generations which covenant he made with abraham and his oath unto isaac and confirmed the same unto jacob for a law and to israel for an everlasting covenant saying unto thee will i give the land of canaan the lot of your inheritance when they were but a few and a few men in number he had very few and strangers in it when they went from one nation to another from one kingdom to another people he suffered no man to do them wrong yeah he reproved kings for their sakes saying touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm you may be seated you think about david crying out to the lord and saying all those things about how that god had always been with them and protected them no matter where no matter where they went or uh you remember the as the children of israel went through the wilderness and and uh god was constantly with them with the pillar of fire and and protecting them everywhere they went and his brother aaron was speaking on this morning when they crossed over the red sea uh crossed over the jordan river and uh the fear of the of the people began to come into the uh into the into the into the people of the cities all around of jericho and they looked at what was coming across and they began to remember all the things that they had heard about god doing for those people and it began to cause them to become fearful and and you know that's really what respect is and respects his respects is what we owe to god and you know when you can see god doing something and i believe certainly god is doing something in the bride around the world and certainly god is doing something in the church here and certainly i believe that uh surely you see that god is doing something in your own life and if you don't see that god is doing something in your life then maybe it's time to just get maybe get along with god and get desperate that god will open your eyes up to see what god is doing in this hour when you see what god is doing now then you begin to get respectful of it you begin to get fearful of it like like how the the with the people of jericho maybe rahab looking out her window his brother aaron was speaking of this morning looking out and seeing them march across and seeing them led by a pillar of fire and led by the word and god doing signs and wonders in their midst and they began to look and see that god was able to god was on these people's side and look and be and they began to look and be fearful now brother brahma said that in all things that we see going on we must give respects to it we must go we must give respects to it we must go we must give respect when we come into the house of god we give respect to this place when we when we look at one another tabernacle for a holy god we give respects to one another when you hear the word coming from behind the pulpit you give respects to the pulpit you give respects to the office of the ministers you give respect to the prophet that god was tabernacled in moving in and speaking through you give respect to that and when you give respects to the to what god is doing now that something will begin to happen in your life and when you begin to give respect or don't give respects if you disrespect god god and what he's doing now then something will begin to happen in your life you see everything handed you got a choice whether you will respect what god is doing or you will disrespect it you've got a choice laying there before you when you you you respect the word that's on display now you see if you go back to ecclesiastes 12 verses 13 and 14 solomon would say that the whole conclusion of the whole thing the whole if you just can kind of sum up everything that we believe is it's fear god let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear god and keep his commandments for this is the whole duty of man so what's your duty what's your duty this afternoon your duty is to come with us respect a fervent a a respect for what who god is and that we've got to we've got to lay our lives down before god and we don't come we're just a haphazard way just laughing and frolicking like the american spirit would have you do but we've been we've been pulled out of the american spirit we've been given a new spirit we've been given a spirit that gives us a sound mind has transformed our thinking so paul uh solomon said for god shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil so that's why we fear we fear because we want to be right we fear because we want to do right and when you do wrong if you're not born again if you do wrong you know there's maybe this afternoon sitting here you know that you're not right and there's something within you that you want to be right and i want to declare to you that the only way that you can ever be right is to get born again to get that true token that brother aaron was talking about this morning the only way that you can ever be right is to take upon yourself the nature of that the righteous one and that's the only way that you can have a righteousness to have your right his righteousness applied to you so the conclusion of the whole matter is to fear god and then brother adam said you cannot have respects until you have fear you've got to have fear of god all you think about how somebody when they become to a place of fear something strikes within their heart and they begin something begins to move and then something begins to pulsating in them and they begin to respond to a holy god like isaiah told me we were talking about this morning when god got him to a place where he looked at the seraphim and he began to his his influence that what he was looking at began to get steered away from uriah to a holy god sitting there with seraphim's proclaiming holy holy holy and the temple began to shake and he began to come under the atmosphere of a fearful god something to be respected you know like brother adam would say whenever he got in the presence of that angel he said you don't laugh or you don't joke but you're you're there you know that there's a presence of something beyond your mortal comprehension something there that's that's come from the office of god come from the throne of god to speak to you and proverbs chapter 9 verse 10 says the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom the fear of the lord is the beginning of the wisdom and the knowledge of the holy is understanding so this afternoon maybe this afternoon if you come with a frolic or come with maybe all these worldly ideas in your mind i want to strike fear in your heart this afternoon maybe you've come with with all these worldly emotions and worldly worldly ideas but it's time to get serious about something it's time to get serious about your soul it's time to get serious about your life and where you're going and what's gonna happen to you when you die it's time to get serious and it's time to fear god because god the bible says that's where all wisdom starts the bible says that's where your duty starts your duty is to fear god now fear the bible will say fear is an awesome terrifying thing fear is fear is terror fear is related to an object causing fear fear the fear of god respect respect reverence piety fear is when you revere something you come into the holy atmosphere of god and you come into the presence of god i believe that's why in the church you come to church to get in that atmosphere where believers are bringing their little licks of fire not just bringing together an intellectual conception but where the power of god is gathered together with the people you gather together and you're sitting in heavenly places with the wither with the people of god and and you know that you're in the presence because something's moving in the building you come into the you come into the sanctuary of the lord and if you need a healing touch or you need to be uplifted or you need to be edified it's here in the house of god because where his word is and where two or three are gathered in my name he said i'll be there now fear fear is when you get in that atmosphere he said that don't mean you're afraid of him but that means that you're giving respect and reverence and when you respect god when you respect god you fear him when you respect god you fear him will you come to god consciousness come to come to an understanding that there's something more going on here than just some old tired people gathered together but there's actually a living god congregating himself and moving and tabernacling him in the people he said you fear that you might displease him in some way you fear lest you would do something wrong i wonder this afternoon how many of us have that kind of a fear well we're afraid that we'll do something wrong afraid that we'll do something that will cast a stumbling block in front of somebody's eyes cast a stumbling block where maybe somebody would look at us and see what you're drinking you're going around sneaking behind closed doors drinking alcohol and getting drunk and stuff or you're going around and smoking pot and doing things and calling yourself a christian but yet where you should be afraid that somebody would know what you're doing and that would cast a stumbling block i believe that ministers of the congregation alike everybody from the top to the bottom should live in holiness and piety walking a straight narrow way because why what are we looking for what are we seeking for we're seeking like brother aaron was saying at the end of the journey we're seeking to come to the full adoption to come to the oneness with christ now brother evan said i fear my mother i fear my mother think about the way he said this i fear my mother i fear my wife i fear my church i fear all of god's servants unless i should put a stumbling block somewhere in our way i fear my mother you know maybe many of us many of this morning maybe many of you sitting here this morning have family members that are not believers or that maybe they don't know anything about god or maybe they know a little bit about what their denomination has told them but maybe they've been resistant to to maybe what some of the things that you've been sharing i wonder maybe let's examine ourselves tonight have we cast a stumbling block you know as brother aaron was mentioning this morning i'm going to be referring to brother aaron a lot because it was such a good sermon but you the world is looking for somebody that's genuine he the world is looking for somebody that's real somebody that can put on display the real what a real christian it is not some of this make-believe stuff that's why brother-in-law is saying i fear my church i fear all of god's servants unless i should put something in their way i fear the people i fear the people of the city unless i should do something wrong that would cause him to think that i wasn't a christian you think about that this afternoon is there anything in your life that would cause somebody to think that you are not a christian if they were to uncover what you're reading at night well if they would uncover what you're watching at night with the netflix and stuff in the privacy of your home own home or what what things what if it were to get out in public what you're doing maybe if young person were to get in the car with you and find out that you're listening to the wrong kind of music or music that sounds wrong or or maybe you're slipping out when you get really upset you slip out with them cuss words and maybe maybe you think well it's all right and everything it's not gonna bother anything but you see it matters i'm talking about fear of god's people fear of god fear of fear of casting a stumbling block in front of somebody i'm talking about towing the line of holiness of living right and doing right he said doing something to hinder the spirit you see what fear fear means what it really means is care do you care this afternoon do you care about living a holy life do you care about coming to church when you need to be here do you care about getting into the bible and seeing what the bible says for your own self like the bereans did and brother brown said before you can have respect you've got to have fear and god demands it he demands respect god does he demands it and fear brings it we know that fear brings respect now that we know that god and the bible is represented by the lion a lion of the tribe of judah and whenever you would hear a lion roar in the jungle instantly everybody would get quiet why because they're afraid is it close to me is it in the bushes is it about to leap out on me and that just the voice of that lion and steals respect the voice of that line causes people to respond that's how god when you hear the voice of god when you get in his presence it instills fear and respect now now you see what it what it is though brother i'm saying take for instance a farmer a farmer a shop worker and nobody pays attention to him look at all of our backgrounds we come from a lot of different backgrounds whether you're a farmer or a shop worker or or a computer engineer or whatever it is we all come from a lot of different backgrounds but you see you could take a farmer or a shop worker or whoever it is and you might not respect them that much they're a farmer or or whatever but he said let him get a job on the police force and come down the street as a policeman with his badge and uniform on let that farmer let that farmer get put into that office and then then see everything changes let that farmer you see it's the office what it is it's the holy ghost and the people that you're respecting you have a respect for god and one another you're respecting what god is doing now that's why i'm talking about respect for what god is doing now god is doing something in his people right now he's doing something he's he's performing something if we can respect what god is doing right now right now in this church service right now in your lives right now in this age he's doing something he's bringing people to adoption he's bringing he's fulfilling his word you know brother brown said who would who would president john f kennedy be if he wasn't president and i'll say it maybe tonight who would president biden be if he wasn't president biden and i'm not talking about whatever your political affiliation is just lay that to the side i'm talking about the man the man if he was not in that office he would be just a man that's how any any person without the baptism in the holy ghost that true token would be if you take somebody and just put them over to somebody maybe a homeless person in the ditch or a worker somewhere out there but then you fill them with the holy ghost and now you've got god tabernacle tabernacling on the inside you're you're respecting god when you respect one another you think about have you ever watched one of those courtrooms and you see how everybody respects the judge back up there sitting behind the behind the stand with his gavel and he's got that black robe on but but at home maybe maybe his kids talk all over him and and his what maybe his wife didn't listen to him and all kinds of things at home but in the office of that judge the people in that courtroom respect and they say your honor your honor because they're respecting the office that that judge is in and brother adam said god is god he deserves the respect god has demanded that for himself and for all his servants god demands respect for his servants his servants now how we know that they're his servants because he vindicates these servants by his word how does god vindicate his servants he vindicates his servants by by proving that they have a correct revelation that lines up with the word by proving because the life that of that revelation is borne out that's why brother adam would say you can't have faith without works you believe and you're going to be living a good life you're going to be living a righteous life because the faith that you believe will produce a holy life you're not going to be out there wallowing around in all the time you're out of the world but you're going to be living a life that is deserving of respect his servant he said he takes these servants and makes them servants of god and proves that they are servants by making his word work through them servants that's why you could take somebody that's yielded to the holy ghost to be yielded to the holy ghost and power and signs and wonders will be done in their life the bible says that their dream dreams and see visions and you'll see a trail of things following behind them because it's written in god's word and god's word cannot lie his word is true then brother abraham said then as you respect that servant you respect god so when i respect you and you respect me and we respect each other then we're respecting god how can that be brother bob how can that be because god is tabernacling in you tonight that's what i'm talking about that god is doing something now he's doing something now he's from the day of pentecost until now he's been tabernacling in people and it's been growing and growing and grow growing until god is truly doing something now if we can open our eyes to see what that is if you can respect one another when you respect one another you're respecting god that's why matthew 25 says then shall he answer them saying verily i say unto you and as much as you did it to one of these least you did it not to me as you did it not to one of the least of these you did it not to me you think about that the least in the kingdom of heaven a little a little child now of course the bible says the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than john the baptist but the least in the kingdom of heaven the one that's that maybe just just got the new birth yesterday if you do something to them if you treat them right and respect them and treat them right it's as though you're doing it to god himself the matthew chapter 18 says take he that you despise not one of these little ones for i say unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven they've got something supernatural working in their life that's why i want to say maybe to these these young girls sitting here tonight if a young man will ever come around you and start disrespecting you and trying to get you to do something that the bible does not say you should be doing you don't listen to that lying snake of a devil you keep yourself holy some snake come around just do it just telling all kind of lies like that like the serpent in the garden of eden because listen a real godly man that you need to be talking to is going to treat you with respect a real christian godly lady and i want to say this afternoon that all these sisters in here i admire you and i respect you because of the standard that you're trying to uphold and the standard you're trying to live it ain't easy to live a christian life with everybody mocking you and everybody making fun of you but don't listen to them let some lying guy come around and talk talk a bunch of nonsense to you when you you're trying to uphold a standard [Applause] brother adam said we know that we being children of god that we are a part of god and god demands this respect and then god shows you who his children are he shows you who his children are oh my if we could examine this afternoon how god shows who his children are what's the effects of respecting god's word what's the effect of coming up to god's word and discerning whether it's true or not and having the right kind of response to it you know in noah's day when noah began to preach and he began to all the world looked like a began to regard him like some kind of a lunatic up there they say there ain't even any water in the sky and you're up there preaching like a man man building a building a big boat up on a hill and there's no water from miles maybe no water in the sky no water around no way you didn't even maybe build a thing next to a lake or something that maybe would have made a lot of sense and everything seemed to be contrary to him but brother rama said now noah had a revelation from god yet it was contrary to anything that science would prove to be true but yet he had spoken to god and god had spake to him so if god had spoken to him and gave him a revelation of what was true then anything if you would give that man respect then you would be respect it would be accounted as though you were respecting god and he went about preparing an ark where the scoffers and mockers scoffed at noah they thought that he was out of his head because he was building an ark but god brought judgment upon them scoffers because they would not listen to the messenger of god and come into that ark under his preaching now see if you would respond to noah's preaching in that day if you would have respected what noah was preaching your revelation would have taken you into that ark and sealed you behind those doors that god had shut and carried you away and taken you into another world taking you away from all that sin and everything until they when the doors open they were in a new world and there was no seeing all the sin had been cleansed off it had been purged and now they they come out and they were they were in a different place you see if you respect god god will do something back for you now brother allah said you can only do things to do two things it lays either mercy or judgment you have to accept one or the other and there is where we stand tonight we either take god's mercy or we stand his judgment and you could this afternoon you can either take god's mercy or rest or stand his judgment by respecting what god is doing now or disrespecting what god is doing now and moses day brother rahm said that people should have understanding understood according to the scripture that god was going to deliver them and was going to bring them out of egypt because you could go back and read the promise of god to abraham and understand that god they were going to sojourn in the wilderness for so many years and then god was going to bring him out you could go look back in god's word and recognize but as soon as god got his man ready and sent him down into egypt they had no respect for him they turned him out and said will you slay us as you did the egyptian you see they begin to look at moses false they begin to look at his failures and they begin to wonder is this is god really this with this man even after all the many signs and wonders that have been performed by him speaking speaking turning the water into blood and gnats appearing and frogs coming up out of the water and all those different things and brother and said the old generation that laughed at moses and so forth and will not accept the message that generation died off and moses coming to another generation after they'd seen all those signs happen and then they come to the red sea and found out that the very god that had performed all those signs here at the red sea doubted god the very first thing that he was able to make a way of escape if god sent the messenger and vindicated by the signs that he was the messenger sent from god then it's up to them to obey this messenger exactly my you think about all the many signs and wonders that we've seen in this day just signs it was constantly a constant stream of things healings happening and going back and looking at what brother branham said in his and his amazing even you know you know you know even the the the picture of the pillar of fire that we hang on our wall was taken by our critics the critics took the picture of the pillar of fire look at joshua and caleb they stayed right by his side yes sir whatever moses was in they was in it too whether moses was right or wrong they stayed right with him anyhow because they know that god was a messenger you think about what a what a bold statement that is whether moses was right or wrong whether moses within his own human nature was right or wrong you know moses killed an egyptian but yet god was going to use that man moses had a speech impediment he couldn't even talk right he stumbled and stuttered over his words but yet god had chosen that man he was going to use that man you see they got all hung up on his faults and failures they started looking at the man instead of the office that he was in moses faltering at the red sea where god began to scold him he said why cry speak don't you know what you're supposed to be doing and maybe the people began to look at what moses failure in that moment moses you know moses had a temper he come down off the mountain when god gave him the ten commandments and he saw what the children of israel were doing and he busted it all over the rock because he had just he in his own human self he just got so fed up with the people that didn't seem to be responding and he had that temper that was manifested so many to later on he struck the rock when god told him to just speak at it and you could look at that human frailty and say well you know what i don't believe that god is with you anymore moses went and married an egyptian and it looked like that would be the wrong thing to do but yeah the bible said that god told him to do that brother branham said that god wanted him to marry the poorer and he needed to marry the poor but he needed to marry a little hot-headed woman that would yank that that would throw that bloody circumcision at him and said you've been preaching this gospel but you ain't even taking care of your own house he needed a woman that would tell him that tell him that straight and you see how you can get so caught up in looking at somebody's humanity that you forget to think to forget to realize that god is still doing something in somebody's life whether it's the minister whether it's the brother or sister sitting on the period next to you god is doing something right now and you got to respect what god is doing respect one another he said there one day we find out that even miriam a prophetess and heir and the high priest made fun of moses wife because she was an ethiopian i thought wasn't there enough women of our own group to marry instead of going out there and marrying that woman that wasn't moses choice that was god's choice for moses and when they made fun of it that angered god in such a way until he struck miriam the prophetess full of leprosy moses own sister what about that why why did she get struck with leprosy because she disrespected the office she disrespected the spirit of god moving in god's people her prophetess she was a prophetess the word the spirit of god would work in her life but she failed to recognize where the anointing was what was she doing she was making fun and irreverence to god's messenger the messenger of the covenant of that day and she was irreverent god demands respect sends his message you listen to it and you reference it don't care if they call it a bunch of holy rollers or whatever they call it let the world do what they want to but you give respects you think about why they called it holy rollers it's because people would get the penteco early pentecostals would get so under the anointing that they would fall down on the floor or they begin to roll across the floor and run around through the building praising god and you could see the effect of the anointing in their life and people begin to laugh and mock at that you see what he's talking about is when you begin to see the effect the holy ghost in somebody's life don't mock at it don't but be reverent toward it that's why we come to the sanctuary of god with shamefulness and reverence now rev that's what reverence means a sense of shame or honor modesty bashfulness reverence modest modesty means that's why our women clothe themselves because they want to be modest because they're conscious of god doing something in their lives they're they're modest they want to cover themselves up bashfulness reverence regard for others and respect what is reverence is being it's being conscious that there's something going on a deep respect for someone or something profound respect and love excuse me don't you fear god in other words you talk about moses you're talking about me if you can't respect moses you don't respect me said haven't i proved you among that he's my servant and you know you have no reverence for him at all what would that be for a lesson for the people of this day no respects no honor and now he said and because you didn't do that to miriam that's the reason you got leprosy that's the reason these things has went because you ought to have know that this was my servant you do know it so when you say something against him you're saying it against me what do we respect we're expecting the respect and the word for this day presented in flesh the word for this day manifested in flesh we're reverencing our little licks of fire gathered together in this building we're reverencing joining our faith together coming together as believers so that when you if you're if you're in need of something you can have somebody that you respect pray for you somebody that you know has a has a is a is in touch with god you see we got a bible from god in the correct interpretation of that bible and that's what we're reverencing we're we're referencing this afternoon that we're hearing from god and that god is doing something i was i was watching this little portrayal of when uh the the united states split from from england and that and the uh i think it was john adams went over to the just talked to the king after the aft after the uh our independence and you think about what a scary thing that would have been for john adams to step in front of a king that had just went to war with us and he approached he approached in reverence and fear not coming in there all laughing and everything so when you come to when you come to a king you come you come you don't come uh you say well like cain did well you could just take take my way or or leave it i i don't really care what you say but you come with reverence and you know john adams or even brother branham when he said when he went to the king the king of england he had to approach in a certain way and walked in backwards and walked in or you know i think john adams had to bow three times or something like that there was an appro a right approach a correct approach to the king and that's there's a correct approach to the to god and it's not just through haphazard and laughing and things and brother baby said if that was the attitude of god in that day and god can't change god wants us to respect what he's doing he demands it you either respect that or something else is going to happen now i'm not talking about this morning i'm not talking about cultish respect well you just respect somebody they go out and they're alcoholic and you but you're still you're still going to church and you're listening to them or something there's all the all the people that we've seen go out abusers and things uh going out and fornicating and stuff like that that's that's getting into cultish mindset but i'm talking about respecting something where the word of god has been proven out where you can see god living on display we're talking about respecting the present tense spirit-filled unfolding of god's word and then brother brown said i know i know of three boys one time that mock communion in the church know of them and they went up in the hotel room you know what communion represents when we come and we get together and we we take communion you're taking the wine and you're taking the word the bread it's a symbol of a symbol of the spirit of god quickening the word in your life and just as you eat that bread and that and that wine it's going it's going to turn into molecules in your body and it's going to make your body grow just as when you eat the word and the spirit quickens that is going to make your spiritual body your supernatural body your theophany body grow on the inside of you it's growing and so they began to mock that communion in the church he said and they went up in the hotel room and got some ham sandwiches and a bottle of whiskey and had their communion up there you see you see why this is not something to play around with you see if god is really in this there's not something to just mock it and and and laugh at and cheer at but there's something real going on here and he said they began to make fun of the communion they had in a pentecostal church and less than three months from them one of them was dead and two of them was in the insane institution you can't disrespect god you've got to respect god don't make fun of the people in the spirit brother brahma said he said don't talk about people that's worshipping in the spirit of god how many times have we seen have we heard people do that somebody will be praising god and running up down the aisle maybe in a special meeting and maybe you'll hear somebody that don't quite have the the right understanding of what's going on and maybe they'll say well they don't know what i know my you see how you're playing around with fire when you begin what if you're blaspheming what the actual holy spirit is doing you see what people want people won't make fun of somebody maybe sleeping in church but they'll let somebody get a blessing one time and somebody will begin to somebody will begin to jeer and say well i wonder if you drank too much coffee or i wonder if you drank too much before that service you got to respect god he said you've got to believe it watch those who really believed it and watch what happens you've got to respect him now jezebel sir was an example of of this day jezebel with her painted eyes and and brother brown said how she disrespected elijah elijah elijah was actually her pastor she should have been going over to elijah's church he should have been sitting under under his teaching and listening to what he she he said and he said oh she wouldn't receive that goodness no she was an atheist or an infidel or idol worshiper and she had her own pagan priest she wouldn't receive it at all and she disrespected him she hated him why did she hate him because he was telling the truth and and in all that telling of the truth it looked like there was a lot of strange things happening the whole nation was without water and looked like a lot of kids were dying and a lot of chaos it looked like but and she she just built up within herself all this hatred and there she was with her painted up eyes and her uh her disrespectful attitude and what happened to her god let the dogs eat her in the street because she disrespected the message that elijah was preaching sitting there with that disrespect with her painted up face and her idolatry and her lipstick wearing and word denying and murderous going and killing neighbors trying to get his vineyard why because her whole attitude her own mindset was i don't have to do what he says i don't have to listen to you i don't have to listen to that stuff i don't like it i don't like all these children dying i don't like us being without water and i don't have to listen to what you saying she was maybe she said i don't need all this holiness and i don't want your holy rolling i don't want a real genuine anointing in my life but you see god demands respect you gotta have it you ever get anything from god you're going to respect god and you must do it from your heart the bottom of your heart you must do it you see that's what this you look around at this american spirit that's taken effect even in the young people of this days even in the young people of this message and this cost called the young people from cause the old people many of them to get disrespectful where they look at the preaching the god and the of the gospel and they don't want it no more you know what the american spirit is the american spirit is just laughing at everything ha ha ho you hear the gospel preached and you don't you just want to go home and laugh about it you laugh out in the parking lot and laugh everywhere you go the american spirit is whispering through the graveyard knowing that one day you're going to come to an end and walking by a grave a grave spot that one day you might be inhabiting but yeah you go through whistling wasting a little tune because you're just ignoring ignoring what god is doing right now he said could you imagine that little jezebel with that painted up face stumping up and down that floor saying that old hypocrite that old hypocrite causing all these little children out here to suffer see sometimes sometimes this is past our mental understanding sometimes you can look at things going on in the church and you don't understand why maybe somebody's being treated the way or something was said to somebody i don't understand that like like naming there i don't understand when why elijah won't come out and meet me and why he's telling me to go dunk myself seven times in the old muddy river i don't come out i don't understand why he won't come out and shake my hand i don't understand why he won't come to my house and do what i want him to do but elijah was trying to bring him back to god trying to win a nation back to god elijah's message did look pretty bad didn't it children suffering people suffering cattle dying sheep dying no water nowhere the night's hot and sultry the sun as bright as brass in the skies through the daytime for three years and six months and elijah's sitting up on the mountain saying not even dude will fall till i call from him while ravens brought him food he was sitting up there relaxing relaxing next next to the brook while god took care of him why because god he respected god and so god respected him back that's what god wants sometimes god will take you through a rough spot because he's trying he wants you to respect him and brother brown said oh how they hated him oh how they hated him miriam disrespected it air and disrespected it no matter who you are christian or not christian you've got to still bring respect to god and respect what he's doing or suffer the consequence it's either receive it or go into judgment either one you want to respect what god is doing respect what god is doing that means respect the deacons that means respect the music that means respect the music that's playing that means respect the ministry and that means respect your parents because if your parents are holy those field christians and they're trying to do what's right for you then that means to respect them you know that's why the bible in leviticus chapter 20 says for everyone that curseth his father or his mother shall surely be put to death he hath cursed his father or his mother his blood shall be upon him because there's a consequence for disrespecting your mother and father when they're trying to trying to present the gospel before you and you disrespect that you're not disrespecting just your mother and father but the office of the holy ghost is within them the holy ghost is within them so they pray they present to you the right way to live and the right way to act in the right way to do and you disrespect that the bible says in colossians 3 20 children obey your parents and all things for this is well pleasing unto the lord i i think this afternoon maybe we'll find out how to how to actually respect god that if we respect one another we're respecting god if we respect our parents then we're respecting god here on this mother's day uh maybe maybe some of the older ones if you look back at the times maybe when you we've all got times where we disrespected our parents surely well we said things that we regret but now as you get older you look back and you remember that your mama and daddy were trying to do the best for you your mama and daddy were trying they were they were doing that maybe you remember back when your mom and daddy were praying long hours for you and you weren't doing right but yet they were calling out to god for you and god began to work in your life you see that kind of that kind of that kind of thing that deserves respect my mom and daddy will get that'll get greyed and bald-headed because they're they're they're crying in the midnight hours for their children seeing their children do things that are wrong and making wrong decisions but something within their heart is crying out and god will answer the cry of a mother and a father god will answer and every one of your children every one of us adults we need to respect our parents i honor our mother and father bill graham said i've seen young people sit in the meeting and snicker and laugh in a meeting in less than 24 hours be crushed into the streets i've seen young people sit in a meeting in one year when i was in a place and next maybe within six months go back to the same place and practically every one of them was gone or laying stricken somewhere with diseases and things that's right you have to respect it and just because you're young does not exempt you from having a choice just because you're young or old or whatever your age is your stature in life you've got a choice you've got the ability to this afternoon to respect or disrespect to accept or reject to believe or not believe what god is saying what god is doing in this hour in proverbs chapter 20 it says who who so curseth his father or his mother his lamp shall be put out in obscured darkness his lamp shall be put out if you disrespect your mother and your father in deuteronomy 21 it said if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son which will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother and that when they have chastened him will not hearken unto them then shall his mother and father lay on him and bring him out unto the elders of his city and under the gate of his place and they shall say unto the elders of his city this our son is stubborn and rebellious he will not obey our voice he is a glutton and a drunkard and all the men of his city shall stone him with stones that he die so shalt thou put evil away from among you and all israel shall hear and fear now in the new testament i'm not saying that we need to go out stoning people that's not what we believe but the old testament you can look at the old testament type and know for surety that there is a consequence for disrespecting what god is doing there's a consequence for disrespecting your parents trying to apply the token over your home and trying to set a standard of holiness over what you watch on the tv and what comes out of your mouth and whether you drink alcohol or not or go out partying smoking cigarettes and smoking pot there's a consequence for disrespect and that's why we've got to teach our children to respect what god is doing i i think one of the greatest parables in the bible is when elisha when elijah followed elijah over and and and kept his eye on him until he saw elijah go up in the chariot of fire and when he came back on his way back he was met by all these little children all these little children who had been taught by their mother and father to be disrespectful to say things around behind the minister's back and say things that well i don't know you know i i don't really know if elisha's really if elijah really did go up in that whirlwind i don't really know if if elisha really has what the same anointing that elijah elijah did when he come back i heard that he he smacked the water with us with with the robe but i don't know if it really worked or not and they began to sow all this disrespect in their children until their children began to make fun of the man of god when he came by and what did what was the effect of that disrespect in those children's life they died their effect was death but why because they had been taught by their mother and father just disrespect the word of god what god was doing now that's why we got to respect what god is doing now we've got to respect what god is doing in our homes we've got to respect what god is doing in our church wasn't disrespecting the man it was disrespecting his message he was a successor to elijah he had the anointing the spirit of elijah was upon him he went right up there and done the very same things that elijah did and now this very same anointing that was on jesus christ is on the church the very same anointing that's doing the exact same works and surely how much more we should respect one another if the same works are being done in our midst he said they disrespected it and they disrespected elijah because he believed in elijah because the spirit was upon him and the people i bet they laughed to one another said hey hey looky they say a bunch of holy rollers fanatics saying that man went to heaven without dying horses come down we don't see any we didn't see any evidence of all that right see those children have been told that at home and brother said if they've been taught reverence and respect they'd have walked out there before that prophet of god and have asked for prayer for themselves but they've been taught to snicker and laugh and to make fun you got to respect what god is doing you remember that story that brother bam told that girl that one night she was brother brown was preaching away and he saw her get up and she started going out of the the the building and something just moved within him and he started calling out he said he he pointedly called out that young girl that the lord is calling you and he called her to come to the altar and receive her salvation but something went in her just hardened up and and she went on out and she said she had one that one day she he met her and she said well brother graham said he said she laughed in my face when i called her to come to christ she happened to be one of the deacon's daughters and standing at the door that night she waited for me when i come out she said i want you to know something right now don't you never embarrass me like that again she was disrespectful to what god was doing right now he said i said god was calling you and she said nonsense i'm young i got plenty of time for that but my daddy's got enough religion for all of us at home my daddy's got enough religion for all of us at home i'm young you ain't never too young to accept jesus when he's calling you if you feel impulse setting in your heart this afternoon it's time to respond don't put it off don't disrespect the call of god he said she said my daddy's got enough religion for all of us at home but your daddy ain't got enough religion for you you need it for your own self you've got to have your own experience you've got to have your own token because you can't go in on your mama and daddy's coattails or on your ministers coattails or on brother branham's coattails you've got to have your own experience and but that's what brother brown said he said not enough for you sister everyone has to have their own religion and she said if i want anybody to talk to me about that i'll get somebody that's got some sense not somebody like you somebody that's got some sense i said go say what you wish to it won't bother me it don't bother me but someday you'll regret it the next time he saw her she said i could see my mother's soul fry in hell like a pancake her heart had gotten so hard that she said i don't i don't even care anymore you see that's a dangerous place don't even care anymore if there's an ounce of care in you tonight i i want to say that there's hope you have not gone too far there's an house of care if you if you're trying to run back to god it ain't too late if you're trying to get make things right then there's still grace for you he said when she came back with her underskirts hanging down slopping with a cigarette in her hand and offered me a drink of whiskey and that's how he met her again that's that's the fate that god is trying to save us when he when he calls you when he's calling you see when you don't respect what god is doing there are consequences but when you do respect when you do respect what god is doing now there's a blessing remember that little woman in the bible that lived down there and shoot him and she saw elijah come through a few times and she said you know he started she said won't you come in and eat a little bit with us and he started coming in and she told her husband she said i you know this man is a little bit different than maybe a lot of the denominational teachers that we've heard maybe all the other other kind of people that say that they talk about religion this man is different you see he was able to discern that there was god moving on the scene i i wonder how many of us when we listen to sermons out there listen to sermons maybe from other churches you get can you discern can you discern what's true or not i rejoice when i listen to somebody preaching the truth preaching from a revelation i believe that's what god wants us to be able to do is to be able to tell when something is right or wrong and instead of disrespecting him like jezebel did she respected that man of god and she said you know what we're going to do we're going to build a little room for him and we're going to set a table over there we're going to put a candle on it we're going to have a little stool in there and whenever he comes by he's going to have a place to see it and the next time elijah come by he he went into that she she pulled him on and showed him what they had made they got the contractor out built it all up and elijah went in there and found that he had a place to rest he found out that this little woman respected him in a way that a lot of other people didn't this was real respect this was a real she might have been rich but that didn't matter she respected him and he said what can we do for this woman and he called her and she said she didn't ask for nothing she just said well we know we live with all our own people we got our own we're happy we're satisfied and he began to talk to gehazi and he said you know she doesn't have a child and so he told her about the time of life this this season next year you you're going to have a child even though you're old it don't matter whether you're old it don't matter whether all the doctors have told you it's impossible but but see she had a blessing because she received a blessing because she respected what god was doing in her house she respected god and when that little child got it got older it was out in the field working and a headache come on and they had had a little stroke i had a heat stroke out there working and it fell over and died and she she she knew that god she knew who she had met that this man had a connection with god and she had a respect for that man so she went chasing after him and he he came he came back to the house she weighed on you know the the story i'm not gonna draw it out and and and he after he died in his mother's arms and and he's and he laid his self over on that child and and the child came back to life and sneezed why because sneezed seven times why because she had respect to the man of god and brother said because of a reverent woman because of a reverent woman like you can have a little sister hattie somebody that looks like donald mountain and nothing's living in a little shack in the mountains that her husband died because a tractor fell over on him and somebody that looks the whole world doesn't doesn't look on with any kind of respect but yet god will respect somebody that respects him because of a woman or woman that respected him a man that respected him and believed him but be a man of god because she respected the man of god god demands respect and you think about martha the respect that she gave jesus when when jesus come walking in after lazarus was already in the grave he came walking in it looked like three days late and she didn't run up to him and say well i don't understand why i don't understand this and that and you should have been here and scolding him all that she came with respect she came with reverence you know you know everybody wants to make a big deal out of mary because mary you know the bible says that mary she wanted to sit at jesus feet and hear the hear the word and martha was always the one in the kitchen cooking and trying to keep things clean and worrying about whether there was crumbs on the table or not and trying to trying to trying to tidy up the place while mary was sitting in there but brother around said mary had a part it come time for her she she had a time to to stand and show her respect and you know every one of us have a time where it comes time for us to stand and show our respect for god mary wanted to hear the word of god so she just sat around and listened at him she didn't care whether the pillow cases was changed whether the curtains was dusted but martha always wanted to cook him a good dinner but she wanted him to do something for jesus in her way and mary wanted to do it in her way so when jesus came walking up three days late and she didn't come running at him telling him scolding him and saying well i don't understand this and i don't understand that but what did she do she ran right straight with where he was fell down at his feet and said lord if thou would have been here my brother would not have died because she respected the presence of god in her miss he said oh there you are what was she doing she was respected she was in the presence of god and she respected him what if we could say that to someone tonight that we respect lord of thou would have been here to know to recognize that god is in our midst the bible says in john chapter 11 then marth as soon as she heard that jesus was coming went and met him but mary sat still in the house and then said martha unto jesus lord a thou has been here my brother had not died but i know but i know that even now whatsoever thou wilt ask of god god will give it thee could we come with respect and this afternoon knowing respecting that god is in our midst what if we could say that brother brown said what if we could say that to someone tonight oh my brother i believe that what you ask god god gives it to you the same results would come in that why the bible says if you've got anything wrong with you you come and let the elders pray over you and your sins will be forgiven you and your oh the slate will be wiped clean and you'll receive your healing and all those other promises why because we're not coming here with just a vain gathering but we're coming together with respect for what god is doing in our midst for respect for what god is doing doing now he said if she had disrespected it would never worked but that was from her heart if you can't respect the man respect the office he holds in god respect the office the office of a minister the office of a pastor of a deacon the office of somebody that's going to help you the office of being filled with the holy ghost that's why jesus said in matthew chapter 10 he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me so if you receive the word that's coming over a pulpit and you believe it and you respect it and it says though you receive it from god himself he that receiveth the prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward was a prophet's reward you heard the word of a prophet and you respected it and now you get a blessing from that and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward what's a righteous man you can't be righteous without the holy ghost that's the only way you can be righteous if your mother and father are righteous and you respect them and you receive what they have for you their words of encouragement and their words of life that they share with you you're receiving it as though it was from god himself whosoever shall give drink to give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple verily i say unto you he shall and no wise lose his reward why because it's as though you're giving a cup of water to god if god is tabernacling you and somebody gives you a cup of cold water in the name of jesus because they respect the god that you serve the god that lives in you it's the same as they gave that cup of water to god himself there was a little woman that she had a she had a daughter that was that was possessed by a devil and she came to jesus and she she said oh lord thy son of david my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil and she was calling him son of david but she didn't have no right to that title because she was a little greek woman she she had heard somebody else using that title but she didn't know what it meant so jesus turned to her and he said he said maybe he was thinking i'm going to give her a little trial i'm going to see if she will really respect me if she really knows who she's talking to and jesus said unto her let the children first be filled for it is not meat to take the children's bread and to cast it under the dogs i wonder sometimes you know maybe maybe sometimes in your christian journey you can look back and remember maybe when a minister said something a little bit harsh to you maybe somebody said something harsh to you and what will we do it look back along the road of life but so many people who were offended at something somebody said and they went off and went went away because they could not they they they could not respect what god was doing now sometimes we got to look past all the little things all the little afflictions all the things that people are saying because it's for our good it's god working god doing something in our midst and she answered and said unto him yes lord yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs and he said unto her for this saying go thy way the devil has gone out of that daughter why because she believed it she respected it if god would answer his prayer for others she thought he'd answered prayer for her and she'd know that he was what he said was the word of god if it was the word of god for the jews it was the word of god for the gentiles too whatever he said that's how she was coming with respect with faith believing and brother brown said that caught him real quick when she said yeah but even the dogs even if i'm a dog give me a little bit of crumbs even if you can come with with that kind of fervency and that kind of maybe that kind of despair that kind of sincerity she was respecting god as she respected him and we respect god as we respect one another can we respect one another that's why the bible says in leviticus chapter 19 thou shalt rise up before the horror head the gray head the gray-headed man and on to the face of the old man and fear thy god i am the lord you see an old man in the church that's lived a long life and maybe made a lot of sacrifices there do you respect maybe maybe people might have hurt you in the past or done things maybe that that maybe you remember wrongly but it don't matter matter because the bible says that you shall rise up before the holy head you give honor to those that have lived life before us that that have paved the way for us and and lived life and done things to make our lives a little bit easier that's why first peter 5 5 says likewise you younger submit yourselves unto the elder that means that means when an elder is walking by you you you greet them and you apply to them and maybe you open the door for them and and you do nice to them you don't turn your back on them submit yourselves unto the elder yea all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility which means nobody's bigger than the other we're all we're all that's what a minister is as a servant so the minister is really the least of all the ministers the one that should be opening the doors and and washing the feet that's why jesus was the first one to wash the feet of the disciples for god resisted the proud and giveth grace to the humble in exodus chapter 20 it says honor thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon the land which the lord thy god giveth thee so if you honor your father and your mother and you respect your father and your mother there's a promise in god's word that he will let you live a long life if you honor your father and your mother and respect them to not rile back when they when they're trying to do right and trying to set an example in ephesians chapter six children obey your parents in the lord for this is right it's right to obey your parents in the lord and now we've got all those examples that we can look in in the old testament and all those scriptures and all those examples but but what about today what is god doing now and i'll be closing here in just a moment we got all those examples for long ago but we've got an example here in joel chapter 1 25 that says i will restore to you the years that the locusts have eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palm worm my great army which i sent among you we've got a promise that's what god is doing now that god by the preaching of the gospel by this message that we have heard that we respect is restoring everything that was lost down through the seven church ages i will restore to you the years that the locusts have eaten and joel chapter 2 verse 28 says and it shall come to pass afterward that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions we've got a promise that in the that that that god will pour out his spirit upon all flesh we've got a promise now you know go back into the old testament and look about how when when david was anointed by by uh samuel that he was anointed and he went on then he was anointed by the tribe of judah and then he was anointed by all the tribe of israel all the king and he became king of all israel he was looking for that he got anointed by samuel but he was looking for that anointing he was looking for an anointing to come to put him into position that's what the bible says in malachi 4 5 6 i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children in the heart of the children to their fathers he'll rotate our hearts back to the original faith and you see that's what god is doing now that's why we have a respect for this message that's why we come to church with reverence knowing that god is doing that now and luke chapter 17 it says the same day that light went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroy them all even thus shall it be in the day when the sun when the son of man is revealed and that is what god is doing now as revealing the son of man in revelation chapter 10 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared through his servants the prophets that is what god is doing now i'm talking about i'm talking about god is going to anoint a church god is going to anoint a church with the same anointing that brother branham was anointed with the same anointing that jesus christ was anointed with because it will be the godhead bodily again back in flesh manifested in the body of the bride do you know that story was typed out in the book of acts when the on the day of pentecost in acts chapter 2 the they received power from god as when they were filled with the holy ghost and they went out doing all sorts of things and they went out testifying and and and healing the sick but then on in acts chapter four they got a refilling in acts chapter 4 after after a while of going and preaching the gospel and and healing that lame man at the gate beautiful and and and testifying in front of all the pharisees they got they got a refilling they got to place in acts chapter 4 it says in verse 24 they lifted up their voice to god with one accord and what's going to make you in one accord it's not our own pity ideas and our own thoughts about what's wrong or right in church and who's doing this or that but what's going to make you in one accord is the word of god coming in your life precept upon precept lying upon the line here a little there little to bring you into a place where you're thinking just like god thinks and they got to a place where they were in one accord and said lord thou art god which had made heaven and earth and the sea and all that and then this and when they had prayed you can go read it for yourself in acts chapter four and they began to pray and i believe they were coming to a place where they knew that they needed what they needed was a true token and i'm not saying i'm not saying let us follow the line of thinking now when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the holy ghost and they spake the word of god with boldness they come out of there with a refilling and what we need in this hour i believe what's happening right now is god is on the scene to give us a capstone feeling to give us a special anointing of the baptism of the holy ghost upon the word that we have been packing in just like when solomon made that temple and he put the word he was waiting for that ark of the covenant to move in and when the ark of the covenant slid into that into his place then the shekinah glory came down upon that temple and it filled that place the place was shaken there in acts chapter 4 the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the holy ghost and they spake the word of god with boldness and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul neither said any of them that all the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things caught in common they were they got to a place where they were so filled that they didn't care about who had more money they didn't care about who had property you can have it i'll help you i'll help you with your doctor bills i'll help you out with whatever you need because what had happened was the holy ghost that had failed on the day of pentecost had been rekindled in their life you see what's taking place now in the church of the living god is the holy ghost is in our midst to rekindle what we had or to rekindle our first love the holy ghost is moving in our life if we can respect what god is doing he's on the scene now in a special anointing he's here brother and said in divine healing he said oh it's such a marvelous thing to read this new testament old testament any of it but the fourth chapter of acts this morning where we start for a little preview now we're going back this is during the time that the church had just been rekindled and what's going to rekindle the church is when the fire of the living god comes up onto a people that have been packing that word in until because it's adoption time adoption time with a special anointing you know when on the day of pentecost peter came out and he began to declare that this is that he began to declare that god is feeling the church he began to declare that he began to identify what was taking place with the book of joel he began to declare all these things but i believe that brother brahma's message came to declare that this is that the thing that we've been looking for this is that that god is filling this church this is that that god is filling his church with adoption power this is that that god is capping off his church this is that that god is manifesting himself in fullness and that's what he's doing now if we can respect what god is doing now god will give us a blessing to realize that god is on the scene now to fulfill his word brother i said all those great respects and so forth all those great respects back then but today somehow it's different today somehow it's different god can do something today and people will laugh at it i believe that we've been different today he said about 40 years ago when the holy ghost first began to fall with the people who locked up the preachers called them holy rollers went out on the wouldn't even feed them in the cities and everything like that they broke corn on the railroad tracks to live by what did they do they had another 40 years the church has suffering went through everything two wars in that time a lot of time a lot of work a lot of a lot of effort but there's a time that's that i believe god is moving in his church now to rekindle and joel chapter 2 it says be glad then you children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month the latter rain the latter rain is when it's harvest time the latter rain it's been growing up and now the laddering comes to anoint you to anoint you into doing something for christ anoint you to to to anoint you to where god really wants you to be positionally placed and brotherhood said now what would take place when god gods begin to pour out the holy ghost upon the church in the last days what would take place when god begins to pour out his holy holy spirit in the church in the last days and he said back then they said it's hudu is hypnotism is a mental flip telepathist it's that this that or the other why because they did not realize what god was doing and they did not respect what god was doing god wants to anoint a church and to cap a church off that's why you got to have a revelation of the son of man to take a rapture because the right without a revelation of the son of man you won't realize that you're an invincible army when the bride begins to realize who she is and what she's here for she will be an invincible army and who are you you are the son of man you are god back in flesh but you can't just be educated into it god's got to speak it to your heart you've got to hear the voice of god speaking to you so that you know it for yourself when the bride begins to realize who she is and there's your answer laying it for you in black and white who are you you are the son of man you've got to respect what god is doing in proverbs chapter 13 of wise son heareth his father's instruction a wise son is somebody to sit and listen to his father have we sat and listened to our father i believe i believe that many can say that we have but a scorner heareth not rebuke a scorner could come and just sit there and with a scowl on their face laughing and everything and and not get any kind of blessing all they'll get is it all they'll get is curses and proverbs chapter 19 verse 20 here counsel and receive instruction that they might doubt that that thou mayest be wise and thou ladder in and that's what we want isn't it a good ladder in we want our ladder in to be correct and our ladder in is to be so wound up in christ until we are in full oneness with christ that god is so manifested in us until he's walking in our members and we're thinking like he does and talking like he is and acting like he is and living a life of holiness and not some kind of tommy rot like all these fakers out there living a life a real genuine christian life can we respect god enough to be concerned do we respect god what god is doing now to care they were disrespected and they called them holy rollers the newspapers waited to say every slander and dirty thing they could and put every dirty slang to it they could and things like that and churches he hauled and laughed at it and made fun of them and turned them away and tried to keep them out of the cities and everything else with disrespect with disrespect and brother i made this great statement he said believe it believe it till it's proved wrong now that's a big statement isn't it then when it's proved wrong then you have a right to disbelieve it that don't associate it with no more but as long as it's being proven out to be the truth then believe it this message has been proven out to be true with signs and wonders and vindication and lives changed at testimonies and doctor reports and and all around the vindication of the pillar of fire that we have hanging on our walls brother said god's begin to pour our spirits our gifts upon us we see it now what is the gift of god today what is the gift of god today i believe the gift of god today he said it's the holy spirit it's the holy ghost in us we've got to respect that we've got to respect it on every person that comes upon we've got to respect we've got to give respect to god's divine gifts as the musicians come forward when he sends those gifts no matter how real they are it'll never help us until we get to a place that we can respect it the holy ghost is here i'm talking about a holy ghost of a special anointing the holy ghost to bring adoption time to the church if we can respect that trust message to bring us to fullness respect it when he comes is what brother brahm said because god is here to anoint the church it's not emotion it's not just putting something on but it's the manifestation of the word and this hour and we've got to respect it the conclusion of the whole matter is fear god fear god and keep his commandments and brother abraham said you cannot have respect until you have fear you've got to have fear of god and your attitude towards what god is doing determines the result let's stand our feet and just praise him and worship whatever you have need of tonight if you're if you want if you have a need we're here to pray for you if you if you if you if you respect god respect him like that little shunamite woman did respect him like nama did when he was convinced to dip himself seven times in the water and see what god will do i want to challenge you tonight this afternoon challenge you to believe god put him to the test the devil likes to pose challenges like that time that he that that that minister put that that poison out on the pulpit and said if anybody here really believes in divine healing let somebody come up and drink this and that little man that that was brother brown was pastor back in the day said i accept that challenge and he came up and guzzled it down and nothing happened to him because god he respected god and so god respected him you respect god and and believe god accept that challenge
