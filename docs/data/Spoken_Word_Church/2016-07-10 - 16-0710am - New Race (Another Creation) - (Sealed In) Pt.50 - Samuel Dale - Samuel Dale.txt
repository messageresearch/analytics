know that you've given to us freely and all we have to do is accept it and Lord how hard it is sometimes to really to be able to just think about accepting something from you when it's so simple all we got to do is just say thank you and it's there for us and Lord but we still want to think in our mind that there's something we can do the only thing we can do is accept what you say and just bless and guide each and every one of us forgive our sins that's the main thing and just have your way with each one bless brother forine touch him about the old blood pressure problems and things and many other sicknesses among us and we thank you for your love and your grace that you've already promised to send your word and heal us and Deliver Us from destruction guide each and every one of us have your way in Jesus name amen Revelations 3:14 and un the angel of the Church of the lady ofans right these things sayith the amen the faithful and true witness who is he the beginning of the creation of God all right so what has been our title now for 50 sermons it's called new race another creation because that's who we are he's the beginning of the creation of God we are the continuation of that creation right the finishing of it up okay second Peter there you know second Peter 1 through 8 Simon Peter servant Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and God less through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through L and beside this giv all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and the temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now notice in the verse eight if these things be in you it doesn't just mean that it doesn't just stop on that is these things be in you and of bound right if they're just there as something to be and you know we got it and thing uh that's not you know heaped up piled up in other words uh increasing because that's what we want we're not in the days of mankind of down through time that has just been satisfied with going to church and and doing good and things like that that's part of it that's wonderful but we're in the day when God God is requiring that we come to a place that even These Old Vile bodies will be changed am and they'll be a Rapture to take us to Glory all right and see mankind has never been responsible for that we read it there the other day it's in Statue of perfect man brother Brown referring to the ages and he said these are not required what these are required see there wasn't required that down through th so they didn't teach it you know it it's always been to me is to look at things you know by way of the Prophet Messenger to think about it and see back in the age of uh say uh Wesley for instance to show you how the relationship of an age does with each one of us and works you know in the days of Wesley it was sanctification right and you know that was when all of your songs was written about the blood I mean not all but the basics a large portion of your songs that are Rel written related to the blood of Jesus Christ was in that day through you know uh what was his name not Char but uh John Wesley's brother Charles yeah all and many of those because that was the pull of the time that was the hour for that right all right but we're not in that hour we're in an hour when all things is coming to an end and all right and doing that then it's bringing us to a different thoughts or level of thinking but it's the same thing they had Christ we have Christ you think about even we say well well they didn't believe like we believe no but they had Christ in their heart right the believing was responsible for the word of the age or time that they were living all right but they had Christ in their life he was that to them and they sung about him and worshiped him and and praised him all the way down to that because we we we've made an emphasis heavily on what that it's been the Holy Ghost in every age all right every age had that Holy Spirit but it's according to it was not the holy spirit that was taken away that's right see that's what we think about it's not it was the word that was taken away all right but the Holy Spirit can only work according to the amount of word that you have right that's so but we're in the end time when all of the word has come forth amen right right so then the word is here it's available right well then we are required to believe all the word and try to walk into it in the age that we're living and then what is it they without us cannot be made perfect so they're waiting on you and I to come to that place all right we've been through a lot of the things talking about you know the these virtues and things and I have just a thought today I I want to get across because it's it's uh it deals with the entire body of Christ and we will eventually come back to studying or bring it in the church ages and show how each Church age I was looking at a quote this morning there where brother Brandon was talking about Peter and you know like illustrating Peter you were this it but he said Peter said you was a stone you know right he said but said I honed you done you fixed you to put you in all right do you realize we are the stones amen that's right you're looking at the pyramid that's you you want a picture of you then there's a picture of you standing there first as an individual that's right but then as to the part of the age that you're living as the church being made into uh manifestation for the time time so he said Peter said I honed you right amen and he said then I see manage you in well that's what we're going to talk about today and so don't go I try to caution you not to run off on I know that the stones in the natural pyramid are not cemented together I read too you know it's not cemented together they were sitting so and hone so until they sit on each other but that's not so in the Statue of perfect man right amen that's right now you're going to see that I hope to today why that the prophet would draw the drawing remember how I kept mentioning it that how that he would draw the drawing Peter would list Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness you know and then the love of God all right but when brother brandom draws the drawing he goes through faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and then he cuts that off and brings it down and then he talks about the Holy Spirit and then he goes into love well we'll get to that this afternoon to where we'll be bringing in number-wise because to me it's very very um needful to understand where we're at am if we're going to talk about the age we live in we need to understand where we're at all right and how everything comes and where the messenger comes in at and how that where it is it'll fit in to show showing us the very person cuz we got to look at the person as being built into the statue of perfect man but we've also got to look at the church all the way through as it's coming forth so all right then now what we're getting to see we've talked about how there's each one of these virtues you know and we talked about that faith is not a virtue faith is a birth all right it doesn't say add faith it says have faith the prophet said and be born again he said now you're laying the foundation right all right see then that's the Holy Spirit right amen and the day you receive now watch it when we get to it with a drawing if we can emphasize it a little see the day that you receive the Holy Spirit you receive that Holy Spirit as a babe right amen Desiring the sincere milk to grow th by Etc all right and being a babe in Christ sure we have the parts the baby's got all the parts if it grows parts that's un un you know not according to the correct thing a baby has departs when it's brought into the world all right now but it doesn't have the virtues to be able to manifest itself and as into life it grows into that naturally talking and as we teach them they grow into those things all right but in spiritual speaking the new birth brings it and God gives you the seal to seal you in in the holy spirit all right now but see then you'll come on down through time and then you'll see the prophet talking about this is sealed in and this is in this is burn in whatever he's trying to express the Christian life amen right as to see what God is requiring for you and I am all right see then it's not to just talk about these things is to be they must come into manifestation or we're going to be like everybody else we're going by the grave you say why are we going by the gra because we're not coming to because your prophets when it said it he said I see only one thing holding off the coming of the Lord he said that's the Readiness of the bride all right so that's our problem we've had 50 years since the prophet left the scene to study the message one message in these 2,000 swing offs and doctrines and ideas of the people of the message you know but that's not no problem because we've had ever since the Bible coming this way a couple hundred years you know into the paperbacks and the different things and coming down through the Scrolls we've had the Bible along time and look at all of the world try to you know split over one Bible until they won't even associate with each other right and why you get down to it oh yeah well there's going to be a little group over here in heaven and a little group over here and little group over here I guess we're going to be like downtown Atlanta you can go down there and you got this group here that it's French and this one's German and this one's Chinese and and they don't associate with each other you know they kill each other if they cross the lines you know but I guess that's way it's going to be in heaven well I I don't think so I think that idea is going to be somewhere else all right they're going to be tied up somewhere else they're going to be together all right but it'll be somewhere else all right trying to think about these things that are required in this day down through time it wasn't required to do this or that or the other but now it's a requirement all right so then like I said why would we have anything else to study about when we can take the prophet's message and and the things and I've taught you from day one the Lord revealing it to me back in the 80s there of the fact of saying that it's through the opening of the word that God will bring these virtues into you and I all right then if we don't study the word and make oursel available whose fault is it right right see this that's plain language but it's it's set to that point but now watch it today see there's a difference in just talking about something and it actually being sealed into you in talking about it the prophet gave it Blasphemous names and stature of perfect man both he said that people have a portion of these virtues and not even born again that's right right all right see then you can house some of these things in your life that listen one person standing there without Christ manifesting something that the other person stands over here with Christ and they're not manifesting it right right you you see what I'm talking about some people with just natural virtues they have natural Temperance patience and you know brotherly kindness and here's a Christian on the other side struggling to try to come to those things right see it's not to just well you know you just don't understand we're in the body of Christ well you're sealed into the body of Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost we'll get to that in a minute but that's what we want to talk about because remember in the Statue of a perfect man and it's in Blasphemous names that brother brand mentions cement or cementing into these things are Vulcanizing and and really Vulcanizing is better than talking about cement cuz cement implies to us come up you know you put a little cement then you put another block put cement put another block but to vulcanize is a different different wording and that's what we want to use because Vulcanizing means that you take it into like a patch on a tube lot of you don't even know there was the word vulcanize you don't even know that the that the tires was like that but some of us are old enough to remember that when you had a flat you could take a bicycle patch and you could stick it on there well you might get to where you're going but let that thing get a little bit hot and it was going to peel off you going to have a flat but they had a thing called a Vulcanizing outfit that you took it you put it on there and it had this patch and you I saw one the other day laying somewhere and picked it up and you lay it down over the hole and you screw this thing down and you know then you it's got material in there and you set it on fire and that thing will burn you know and what it does it burns that patch and Tube or melts them together right all right it will hold real good well now that's what God is trying to do y to his bride am okay is trying to bring forth these virtues through his church all right and then to vulcanize them together and remember now you don't vulcanize rubber to metal that's right it's got to be the same material so now in the Statue of a perfect man every one of those materials has got to be the same right it's Godly Faith Godly knowledge Godly Temperance Godly Faith all of it is Godly it's not just because that we can do sure we can have as I said some of those things we can have them and not even be born again well truly you can say well you know I I here I have the new birth do you think that that these things here that I could have some of these other things yes why because that's the only natural that's what I've tried to explain it's only natural to have some of these things pulling us because if you don't get nothing out of the message while everybody's waking enough get this all right get this I thought that we believed that to look at the pyramid and see it and we see the lies which is love I sure when you're born again you have love right but let's call it baby love you you have those things and love now watch this is where that I've always tried to explain something to you that headstone that Capstone that love we talk about is pulling us from the day in any born again Christian amen are you following me any are ever born again Christian that love is above pulling us cuz that's the positive it's not negative like this is negative that would be Rubber and this is positive would be metal see not that way it's partial realization when you're born again right cuz that's your earnest what's pulling you have you ever thought about ever person is being pulled by God to upwardly into a Christian Life I got a quote L here where brother Brown said you either have a downward pull which that's what we born with right he said are we have an upward pull right all right so that's why I've always tried to teach you it's the word of prophet and what he said it's your soul is your theophany no mine's up there mine's up under beyond the curtain well no I ain't I'm page 80 of the Hebrew Book what your Prophet said your soul is you the now I didn't argue you going to argue with him well can't you see the positive is pulling you do you realize there's a change of of a body for somebody right we have a choice of those things that's right but there's a day that'll pull somebody right into that change do you realize in God that's already there you realize in God the Eternal life that you have by the new birth is just as powerful as the very God of glory amen that's right amen it's just brought to us as a new birth he's pulling us the day you're born again God starts pulling us well watch it through the pyramid once he gives you the new birth he's pulling you this right is in this right place right that's right hey we see somebody come in the door back there that we ain't seen in a long time as sis okay everybody turn around there sister or everybody's come everybody you know matter what who he talking about who he okay all right good to see you say where's the boy he rambling with you oh he's back here okay okay am yeah all right but see talking about now see when you get the new birth you get it as a baby amen but God wants us to grow up that's right amen and wanting us to grow up he's drawing us upward right he's drawing us to himself leave that love up there amen don't try to bring the the love down on to this it won't fit correctly come on leave it alone just fill the sides in now you going I hope you'll find that out in a minute about the Holy Spirit and what it does all right but you see each one of these virtues then as they're brought forth by the opening of the word to you it brings God's virtue it brings God's knowledge amen right see all right brings the temperance hey brother or we got a whole family okay all right I might not to recall his name let go around the world he'll be mad at me to get through okay but listen now as each thing these virtues are required on the stature of a perfect man that's right not just written out there to look at something to be good but it's required for you and I and now remember why we was teaching because not to lose some but to go on see Peter says to those that have obtained like Precious Faith all right I believe and I've always taught it since I heard the prophet's message that you're born again at Faith amen right right you say yeah but I was born up here cuz this is my age well boy you sure left off a lot of God I don't want it that way amen I believe every Born Again believer is born again at Faith that's the new birth that's why it's not an ad it's a birth a baby that said it's birth the baby's birth yes but it doesn't have the virtues of a of an adult in manifestation it has everything dire to grow into that but it has to have the growth development and that is the Christian Life right and we were not taught that see to where that it's required that we study the message the Bible to mean see before these virtues can come into being all we got to do is to study the Bible and let God bring them into being see we had to have the message come that's right absolutely amen we had to have the end time to be here we we sure we talked about these things like we were talking about when you get to Godliness sure when I was in the Baptist Church I could look up words I knew that where it says Be You therefore for perfect had nothing to do with a sinless life it had to do with a grow development amen I could read all right but see we didn't think about that but then a prophet comes along he tells us these things hey wait a minute he's telling me that all I got to do is grow up in God and and you know as I grow up in God he keeps imparting to me and as he does then I'm the partaker of his divine nature not it's just because I was born here or i' born there no see you're you're throwing away your own opportunity of Christian growth development to you say yeah but but brother Dale said I was born right up here where the was up here where the Pentecostal was at where we could shout speak in tongues and all like that I said all well and good that's their age that's their time but see our time is the entire word amen what those people had is our our property too amen why can't we enjoy it okay let's get on a little bit see the prophet says that these these in the Statue of perfect man each one of these virtues has to be the same material to vulcanize it together right the old tires you put it on I'm in the tube you vulcanize it it become one with a tube if it didn't it pulled loose but if you heated it enough it become right all right that's what God does to you and I he's got his own heating out bit and he kind of puts us through it you say yeah but brother Dale I think I'm way up here well that's good if you got all this down here now what did your Prophet say I think I got three of them laying here what did he say if you're saying well I'm up here when this down here is not correct so you got to come up Faith virtue knowledge temperance patience amen but you said but I'm up here brotherly kindness what did your Prophet say he said Satan will try you I'm quoting brother brandom and he said that's where you'll crumble right so let's take an example brother Dale I'm just at Faith the new birth you know but I think I'm way up here at brotherly kindness when Satan tackles me are you listening I don't have God's virtue I don't have his knowledge I have head knowledge I don't have his Temperance I don't have his patience and even though I can talk about brotherly kindness I don't have it and he'll try me and what'll happen when he puts the pressure on crumble right you're going to fall back down to where you start at right CU remember now watch this if you don't get nothing El remember this if God seals something into you that will not crumble no that's right amen true but that's why you got to go up up up up being sealed in you can't just go up and say well I got brotherly kindness he just sealed that one in up here and then oh I'll get these other things one of these days now God ain't going to do that that's right CU if he did he'd said it here in Peter he said well some of you might get some brotherly kindness so hold on to that that it's sealed in but you no he's telling you you add to your faith virtue it's not your faith what is it it's God's faith given to you which is the New Birth the prophet said have faith and be born again he said you're laying the foundation now what the next one brotherly kindness no it's not see you're going to have to bring every thing in together and as I said a moment ago then let that that's pulling us sure all born again Believers come to Faith birth God's finished product of that individual is pulling that individual toward him right now come on but you see the people as I've always taught you what have I said for almost 50 years the biggest biggest portion of the people of this message are going to die and go by the grave Born Again Believers why I don't have to back up 40 or 50 40 something years ago I taught you that right and looking at them now to see them I didn't mean they'd leave the message like they're doing now I just meant they're going to die and go by the grave all right but you look at them now man it just parting all over the place amen death is taking them amen right it's killing them but see I stood here and said that a long time ago so then I don't have to back up that's right see death is going to take us if we can't have the faith to be changed that's right it's not an automatic process we're waiting on the bus to pull up well I've always said this if you better remember one thing if you're waiting on a bus to pull up don't go down to the airport you know and getting ticket line you stand there waiting that's that's not the right place to go at least get where the bus depos at you know you got to get where the bus is going to run right all right see just trying to be part to what we're talking about but get a point all right remember when you receive the new birth according to the Bible Ephesians 4:30 that is the Seal of God that seals you into the body amen that's right all right that is the material we need all right that brings us into the body and seals Us in and it won't come apart then if we just wait and let him seal the next and seal the next right brother Brown said we need the cement of the Holy Spirit to stick all of this together all right now why would he call it cement of the Holy Spirit or that we are as we'll get to it later on in the message you realize the day you're born again you realize you're magnetized Amen to The Headstone sure that's come on headstones a magnet remember what he was explaining where he was in the place and working or seeing the guys working and you you welders you people that know you just take a magnet and you just run it over they sweep all of the shavings out where they grounded up and this magnet would come by and it'd just pick up all that metal you know how to sweep it he'll just pick it up they said well what about that piece said well that's aluminum so now it's not magnetized correctly amen for the the aluminum right we said well what about that piece that is metal he said it's bolded down see it won't come up all right see when you're born again right when you're born again then it magnetizes you all the way up it makes God pulling us it's hard to use the word negative to the people in the message they don't like it I don't have no problem saying negative to positive cuz I know a little bit about electrical wiring not not a lot but a little bit I know the ground wire on electricity is more vital than the positive yeah right you got a guy sitting back here that knows all about them things and can explain it to the letter but I got enough sense to know you can run all this room full of positive wires it won't bother a thing but then you take and ground it now you got it come on you ground it it'll work amen so the ground is a very great thing in God it is not just a negative it is a partial realization to bring us to a perfect realization all right see but it's got to be the same material now before it can be vulcanized together everybody understand that part it's got to be the same material all right then being the same material then watch the point if the holy spirit is the seal that seals you in now that's the same material right that's right so it's going to make you and I sealed in right by the new birth okay see that is the material of God so then anything else is going to have to be sealed or vulcanized to that and then it'll come forth in the right way cuz if it's not vulcanized it won't work so you can't make drawings we tried to settle down and and do the best we can but we tried to to do it go ahead brother Joe and pull up a little bit cuz I want you to to look at it of what I'm trying to say in the natural drawing while he's getting to that point remember the Holy Ghost comes down and seals you and I right now here's why your Prophet put that word Holy Spirit that's not in your Peter and his listings so then what does that make 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 nine things right now that's wrong number we'll get to it this evening there's only seven ads right you don't add the Holy Ghost that's right right right your Prophet knew exactly what he was talking about when he made the drawing that Holy Spirit is the same holy spirit all the way through and what is The Headstone the holy spirit amen that's right so look what your Prophet is bringing out now now it's the best we can do with a drawing when he gives you the new birth he seals you in that's right right yep amen he seals you in okay that can never be taken away cannot be destroyed cannot be anything done to it because that is the Seal of God Amen that's the new birth that's why brother R said have faith be born again all right but see virtue even though you've got a connection now if you're looking at the drawing don't think it's made incorrect you see this drawing is full of and this drawing is ful that was made for that amen all right in between is dotted lines representing that it's can be working but not there the way that it needs to be that's right all right but this is sealed when he gives you the Holy Spirit you don't leave a gap up at the top right amen but this is already SE SE amen yes that is The Headstone am that is the seal as when we'll get to it but we don't want to drop it down we just want to let the prophet be the answer amen all right so watch now as these virtues come forth into you blem his name and a statue of perfect man he seals them in right now get to the next draw and then you'll see what I'm talking about you see this drawing now has virtue already sealed in see before you didn't have it sealed in knowledge is are here it's not sealed in that's right anything in between in here messing up can crumble these but it cannot crumble this the new birth cannot be crumbled amen amen that's right faith cannot be crumbled it is sealed amen into you there's not a Gap open that Satan can get in you better remember what your Prophet what did he say he said you're sealed in he's sealed out said if You' done this that or de what did he say he said you went out to him he can't get into you now how do you go out to the Devil with the body and spirit you can't go out with your soul because it's born again it's sealed in all right but you get what I'm saying see when you come forth with virtue and it's sealed in there's no way to crumble this do you understand then what we're trying to illustrate see once knowledge comes in we only done one or two yeah he did do knowledge okay once knowledge comes in it's sealed in see that's not head knowledge that is not just virtues of being a Christian and being good what did the prophet say virtue is strength well now watch him the strength of all of this so now brother around not just talking about this kind of strength right Jesus had these virtues right he had the strength his this is the strength he said of all of this y once you fill this all the way up and making those sides there's no way Satan can get to it now we'll get up here to where we got to come into the age that we're living in sure we'll get the ages to go with it but individuals has to come up well where am I at brother Dale that's your choice that's right I cannot tell you where you are at right right and it don't do no good if you tell you where I'm at out cuz that ain't going to do nothing but a help to you to realize that this can be this or that can be and there is hop for all of us remember God is the one that seals these things in right thank Lord when I got that knowledge it just yeah if it was the right knowledge right remember this material and this material and this material is the same up in here you can question about it he's got one line already pulled up to Temperance as long as you see that solid line is reference in what I want you to see is that it's sealed in it's sealed in if it's a solid line why because that's why your Prophet put the Holy Spirit right here that's right right come on Peter said Faith virtue knowledge temperation Godly his brotherly kindness the love of God brother Brandon put Faith virtue knowledge tempation Godly his brotherly kindness Holy Spirit and then the love of God what's he trying to tell us I read you the last quote there from the prophet he said the Holy Ghost come in the Statue of a perfect man the holy ghost coming down through Christ Holy Spirit that's not two gods this is already sealed it don't have to be sealed these is what has to be sealed come on that's why the Rapture will take place in this age the seventh Church age now where do we get to the mathematics of this thing in this afternoon because you're going to see I I hope what we're talking about cuz there's eight things in that pyramid 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 you put the Holy Spirit here see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and there's eight that's eternal life we got to bring this thing to eternal life or there's going to be no Rapture that's right years ago back in the early 70s they were teaching an eighth day Day message that we was already in the eighth day that's where all of that come you know that go up under the Ohio River all of these things you know Millennium was already there all of that stuff people were saying I'm already in the eighth day I tried to teach it then that's way I teach it now when you're born again your soul is eternal right you know your soul is in an eight that's right but your body is still in a seven now this is what's going to be connecting later in the message you realize that the Millennium is still a seven that's right amen the world don't go into an eighth day until the future home the Millennium is still under a seven R said there'll be things in the Millennium that won't be in the future home why because that seven going into it but you and I have already stepped ahead by the new birth Amen in our soul it's Eternal but our body and our Spirits not right page 48 future home the soul is redeemed but you're waiting the Redemption of the body what's going to redeem this body well there's just going to be something out this there going to be brother so and so he he he yeah that's what you've done yeah I'm talking to the people of the message out there you too that you grab these things as they come along thinking it was going to be a great thing let a young man come along in the message and boy he's got this delivery he's got this going and everybody just flocks to him and there a while it just D you see them just fall away and go into some kind of an error what did your Prophet say he said you'll find scrap peaps of ministers and others he said piled along the way but everybody's looking for something now they're running to the Tabernacle I'm not throwing off none of my business now they're going to the Tabernacle why because Joseph is now pastor that's wonderful I no problems it's none of my business but I wasn't waiting on Joseph right I've Been Waiting on Jesus amen right why because listen these things have to be in us and sealed you realize you can't tear out none of this if it's sealed in and see that's why the Holy Spirit comes up seals you in holy spirit comes up and seal Holy Ghost comes up and seal you Holy Ghost comes up and seal that's why brother R and put the Holy Spirit where it was at on the drawing Peter didn't list it brother Ram told you how right that's now listen come on Peter brought the message and told how to get where he was come on your prophets when it said it the disciples had these virtues he list it right here these virtues he said but they didn't have the headstone he said hadn't come yet all see then Peter was telling you how to get where he was right here in this Holy Spirit and all of these things within him sealed in him amen he's trying to tell us how to get there but once we get there we still got a step to be made The Headstone has to unite with the body to bring a change amen it's your prophet's words all right but you see like I said 50 years of studying it we ought to at least know what the prophet said that's right you ought to know that I'm not just kidding when I say that brother randam said it the Bible said these things are sealed in amen and that's sealing Satan out but there's things that we need in here that are not there this holy spirit is the seal cuz if we could draw this on up I don't know where brother Joe's got it to where you can just keep pulling it on up now you get to where oh now you got the pyramid the way it's supposed to be don't take that Holy Spirit out right remember Sister Shepherd dream and Junior dream one of them calls it a flange in the top of the mountain the other one calls it a rock box so all we got to do is just fill this in make a rock box and let the Holy Spirit pour in and let it run down through these things and the head will unite the drawing's perfect it's not something to just talk about it's perfect but if those things are not sealed in us but get my point what's pulling what was pulling them disciples don't you think that Jesus Christ was The Headstone amen but why does it St that The Headstone was rejected hold them denomination was it I'll remind you there was only two of them Pharisees and Sadducees and a few herodians in the days of Peter now was it the denominations that fell away right I know I preached it right here and I know two brothers that did not like it period whatsoever brother brandham said the bride went to NAA and messed up oh they went down and they run back yeah they went down and they run back and brought a devil's Doctrine with them yeah but him disciple right the pure un adulter at word lasted four ages Luther come out with a trinitarian Doctrine I know the message you see that's what we think our ideas will put these things but it won't fit in the scripture why did Paul preach to those that had these things in the first church age and said you've lost your first love yeah but it was it the bride everything was all right with the bride no it wasn't the bride should have never went to n right they would have know better than that oh you know what it was we can go down there and help them be careful how you go help somebody remember don't back in a mudle to try to get somebody stuck that's in the mud hole right right stay outside and throw him a rope would brought an old Jeep one time old International thing and had Big old tires on it men weighed was going fishing we went over this place he said Daddy drive right straight across our and he said you don't have to drive all the way around on that road I said do you see them two tracks I said they don't make it through that bottoms they went halfway so unless they picked him up with a helicop he come back this way and see that's the way it is we think oh yeah yeah we just go down there and help them people out I know I'm dirty but how many of you done like I done stayed in the denomination try to help the people amen come on you stayed for a while trying to help them didn't you right cuz that's just the love of God in your heart right but listen Church what are you talking about brother Dale I'm talking about each one of these has got to be cemented together and this is the cement right here this that runs over here and goes down is the holy spirit that's what cements it together we had the new birth that's fine you get the new birth but then when you not when you get not he don't go up and seal that in and leave a gap that's right it'll crumble I didn't write the book you read the prophet it'll crumble because that down under there be fool what it going to do you drop if you put brotherly kindness up and had it all sealed in well what happens in between it crumbles it goes down right no God don't do that that's right each one of these he says you're birth into this into this into this into this into this into this and see you'll be birthed into that that's right I didn't write the book re statue of perfect man but see most people don't know what he taught it CU they never read the book and don't listen to the tape we've had 50 years what's the matter with you oh brother D just an intellect well if my intellect has been 50 years holling it why happen to you that's right am at least there one thing I got the feel full of seed the Holy Spirit can Quicken it but if you don't have the seed in the field he can't Quicken nothing that's right that's right I'll take what I got if it's intellect cuz I'll wait on him and I know I can be waiting at the bus not down into airport whatever God wants to do it'll he'll come to that that he's SED that word down into you if you'll hold on that's right right do you get what I'm talking about yes The Headstone is pulling us when you got born again it was drawing as you come up far enough The Headstone nose to seal that in and he keeps drawing you pulling you and when we come up to Holy Spirit you don't have to draw it up you just seal in the sides let that Holy Spirit that's been doing all the sealing just seal the sides in now you got the whole thing cuz remember the prophet says this seals you in he said then The Headstone will come and seal the whole thing y don't you don't have to run another line down through here come on you don't have to run another line down beside this seal you just bring them two together and it's sealed that Holy Spirit is a seal that might not mean nothing to you or your thoughts but you ought to realize one thing it's not automatically put that being a Christian is not just something well I I've been a Christian what does he want me to do I I'm a good person I do this I do that praise the Lord the kindo priest has got you beat all right you don't believe in being good no don't believe in being good I've said that for 50 years I don't believe in being good I believe in being born again and that'll make you good then it won't be my ways of doing and my filthy righteousness cuz if he's there you ain't going to have no dirty it's his righteousness it's his faith it's his virtue it's his knowledge it's his temperence is his patience amen but you see the prophet gets over to the back of stature of a perfect man what does he say well I got all these things in here Lord now let's get this on the way he didn't say that he didn't say it when he's talking about virtue and says see there most of us is going to miss it to start with but but he he was he was up here he just was he why would he say when he gets over to the end of the statute of a perfect man he said fill me up Lord with this virtue this knowledge and Temperance and patience and he said that I may teach others Apostles prophets pastors and for the perfect ing or bringing these things into the body amen see the whole message is correct do you understand what I'm saying the day you was born again God was pulling you y you say well why didn't it do it because they didn't know how right this was lost this ability to bring these things forth was lost your early church had them yeah right come on sure the pure unadulterated word lasted for ages that's your Prophet saying it but then the word begin to die down what word this word the teachers begin to relax and well I think we're up here I think we're there I think we're over here I think we no you don't walk up to a baby and it laying down in a cradle and say well you know son I think you got patience he looks at you go right no you watch him grow and he gets patience when he's about 80 years old right somewhere between 70 and 80 you finally realize you've done live long enough that there ain't nothing you can do about it it ain't no turning back so you might as well settle down and forget it right like I've always said you don't you don't know how to raise kids until you've raised them and then they raise them you know you you have kids and you try to raise them and then they have kids and they try to raise them then you look at him and say boy I goofed up we sitting at the house one day and Wade and Terrence was sitting there I don't think Anna was but they were sitting there and one of the grandbabies you know was doing something and they was and I said hey boys I said you know now y'all learning I said you're learning what we went through you know hey I know people don't like me I've never been mean going a hateful little Abby sitting back there when she was a little baby I told him I said now you got you know you got a spank that child if you come to my house you know don't come if your kids are going to destroy everything there cuz I'm going to stop them cuz we done paid a whole bunch for that and they belong to us and you can't they're collectibles which you know a lot of people come in they just turn their kids loose and they just run all over the place and no just don't come to the house I'm not an arrogant I'll meet you at the cafe and pay for your supper but you see we taught the kids don't don't you know the first word Josh ain't here today but you know the first word Josh learned hot that was his first word you know why he said that cuz we had a wood heater in the house he's crawling across the floor and we Nanny get over and say hot so one day he crawled across the floor and he looked at the heater and he went hot it took training right come on you come to the house I expect you to control your children like if you don't I will cuz you're not going to tear up everything CU it's not I'm not going to come to your house and do that my kids te up something your house I won't pay for it see I believe in being sensible and being right cuz I believe in raising kids but you know the kids learn to do good by correction right Abby was doing something one day wrong and I said you corrector well poppy you know Poppy's said old guy you know do I said take don't beat her don't don't hurt her don't hit her with your hand go get your little Ken hick they say now you can't do that you know I said get your little keing hicker and she does something wrong with just Tapper well wouldn't get up do it I went outside and got a little Hickory I brought it in the house I said here well they really couldn't understand it come old Doty old granddaddy loves everybody you know but I was trying to get her to see and let her raise you know what she turned out to be a good kid they didn't have to they didn't have to use that right sister or sister or used to have a spoon right back there and brother Gary at Atkins used to say if you want to follow the lord read your Bible and study if you want to learn how to raise kids go find sister or that was that was his statement she used that come on you know God has to do that to get us sometimes you say does he whoop us into these things well whatever you want to call it he's child training us that's right you you say well I need patience well you know we don't beat each other on the back but it is Right Said tribulation does work with patience you know but you understand what I'm getting at you see why the prophet put Holy Spirit right here because he didn't put down the head on the top of it this has got to be here cuz that headstone was rejected even the disciples didn't have it it was rejected Jesus Christ was the Chief Cornerstone come on listen listen Jesus preached six seals in Matthew 24 there's not one disciple mentions it oh Peter I one of them wrote it you know MTH yeah they wrote it but they didn't teach it Paul got the closest when he' call him the man of sin or something John learned on patmas about her Antichrist right none of them taught it why is it none of the disciples if you think the head came down there of all the thing why did not none of the disciples mention the son of man come on show it to me Paul I mean the disciples wrote about that's writing what Jesus said even Peter saying Paul says things hard to be understood that many wrestle to their destruction but Paul never mentioned son of man why because it would be the end time to be this Prophet that would bring it forth that was The Headstone they rejected Jesus preached six seals in Matthew 24 and he was the seventh see and they rejected it you know the reason they rejected it cuz they didn't know what it was right right they didn't know what it was they Ste it the god of glory and even the disciples could not understand him being that until the Holy Ghost came down on the day of Pentecost into their soul and gave them Eternal eye then they knew what Jesus was talking about but remember by the time he died it doesn't matter if they were writing it there was no way for those seals to be revealed there were to wait till the last days he said Brother D what are you making it making it what I always have for 50 years this message the opening of those Seven Seals is The Headstone to the church now you show me something else it is it's got to be a message but see they turned down that hedone well that was just a other man no the disciples is because they didn't know what it was come on the biggest portion of people this message is turning this message down because they don't know what it is that's right that's right they can quoty things but where are they teaching the people now that we need these virtues oh that's way back under brother that's way behind why is it that the headstone is not United with the church amen oh of course there's a lot of people in this message says it has you want me to call names or just leave it alone and tell you is what some people don't a lot of people talk polygamy as to be the great Revelation under the seventh seal I'm too old folks I still got a decent memory that I know where all those things come from but you ought to know it's true right that's why it's so messed up in the message the way it is because it don't people don't know what to believe that's right amen well that brother he he he he walked with a prophet he hunted with him he he fellowshipped with him praise God I wish I could have been had the ability to do but you know what the Bible tells me a great honor come on musicians you know what I consider a great honor the Bible says that those who believe without having to see are greater than those who believe because they see that's the Bible right you mean it's a great honor it's a great honor to be able to believe God that you didn't have to see that's right especially they that what believe and have not seen we've got people among us that saw the prophet and the healings and the signs and the Wonders thank God for that I consider that an honor and a pleasure to associate with people who walked with the prophet but that's what I told Brother Mo when he began to tell me about a prophet I said listen you saw the dead raise the sick healed and the things but I said I wasn't there but I said you tell me what he taught in the word and I'll tell you whether he was a prophet or not I can't look at the signs and wonders and and call it but I can look at the word right amen that was brought by the man Y and I can see like my wife said one day she said if if all those things happen he's talking about we listening to T she said he must have been a prophet will you know that's true what about you let's stand think on these things now and watch it this afternoon when you will see that we're not going to take that Holy Spirit out but we're not going to count it as eight things because this seal is this right here and that right there that is the seal amen that's why there's eight things there amen come on the holy spirit's not a ninth One Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience Godly brother kind and love that's eight things but there's only seven ads right what a wonderful point you know what there are seven Church ages right but there's eight manifestations of God through the seven Church ages or else we've missed it all your Prophet is Right am he knew what he was talking about that's right it's not just numbers wise and things to try to show you how smart mathematically no because mathematically you'll never figure nothing out in the scriptures see mathematically you're going to leave it up there and you're going to make nine but by Revelation this is the holy spirit right there that's why it's wrote in there it's the holy spirit that made this age that made this age that made this age made this age it was a holy spirit in never age it's wonderful and simple a revelation from Jesus Christ go ahead brother 596 anybody have an need the AL is open anybody have a need y'all hear the CR I know hising me to my heart he speaks to me and I age Lord please come and control I feel the Matthew is selling his house and buying another one and he wants a pray cloth so we'll give him one to put there

send these prayer clouds we know Matthew is not feeling too good right now either so we believe for him and we thank you but we sending these about selling his home let everything be according to your
