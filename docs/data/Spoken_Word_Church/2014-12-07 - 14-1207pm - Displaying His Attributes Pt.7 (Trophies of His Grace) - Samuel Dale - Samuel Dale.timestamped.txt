[9:08] Zachariah verse six said he answered and
[9:10] spake unto me saying this is the word of
[9:12] the Lord unto his removable saying not
[9:15] by might nor by power but by my spirit
[9:17] sayith the Lord of host who art thou oh
[9:21] great Mountain before
[9:24] zeruel thou sh become a plain and he
[9:27] shall bring forth The Headstone there of
[9:30] with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto
[9:33] it you may be seated the Lord had his
[9:36] Blessing to the reading of the word now
[9:39] you remember zerubabel here would would
[9:43] uh stand in representation and represent
[9:47] the end time you know to where we're at
[9:50] and you know the prince with God but uh
[9:54] you know what we want to talk about is I
[9:57] just want to speak a little bit about it
[9:58] to too uh sister Ceta some of you have
[10:01] heard of this of a vision or dream a
[10:06] little boy had in 1937 about uh seeing
[10:10] California the earthquakes and the thing
[10:13] some of you already have it but if you
[10:14] don't have it there's a copy here you
[10:16] can take it and get somebody to run off
[10:18] some copies all right because that way
[10:21] you know some of you may not have ever
[10:24] uh seen it and all we've we've had it
[10:26] I'm sure I got it in my uh stuff at home
[10:30] but uh you know if you want a copy of it
[10:32] make sure you get one all right but now
[10:35] what I want to do this afternoon is just
[10:38] because that was intentions this morning
[10:40] to come into it and speak
[10:43] about the grace of marriage and
[10:46] divorce all right now first
[10:50] off as I said there would be
[10:54] qualifications or things that would have
[10:57] to take place and that's what I was
[10:58] trying to explain laain this morning and
[11:00] so I just kind of put it into a message
[11:02] form to be able to talk about the grace
[11:05] of
[11:08] God you see God gave
[11:12] us an
[11:14] opportunity he has here in the end time
[11:16] for us to come to a place that I
[11:21] believe
[11:22] somebody is going to come to a change of
[11:26] the body cuz the Bible says it now I
[11:28] believe that see somebody well why can't
[11:31] we believe that we are
[11:33] them all right but it would have to be
[11:36] at a certain thing because you can't
[11:40] just say well just Grace you know that's
[11:43] what it's getting at this morning you
[11:44] know we just say well what do you mean
[11:46] brother it's just Grace you know we
[11:48] believe in the grace of God yeah and
[11:51] what did everybody have their ideas
[11:52] about
[11:54] Grace from you can go do anything you
[11:56] want to and still be saved to anything
[11:58] in the world yeah but that won't turn
[12:00] out to be the true Revelation because I
[12:04] I believe like I was saying this morning
[12:06] my point
[12:08] was God gave a prophet in the beginning
[12:11] when he started dealing with mankind
[12:13] outside of the garden you know in the
[12:16] coming
[12:17] down he gave a prophet all right and a
[12:21] prophet is Grace to the people right
[12:23] that really want it now he's a sign of
[12:26] judgment to those who don't want it all
[12:30] right so he's doing a compound thing see
[12:33] he's speaking it and he's bringing it
[12:36] and and see God gave Moses
[12:39] then to go down to Egypt to free the
[12:43] children of Israel and I'll read you
[12:44] something in a minute from the marriage
[12:46] and divorce that where brother brandham
[12:48] is speaking about
[12:50] it but see that Prophet is a sign of
[12:54] Grace
[12:56] right right but what did we find out
[12:59] this morning we were talking about the
[13:01] prophet is a sign that God the Messiah
[13:04] you know the quote is that the Messiah
[13:07] is going to speak all right John the
[13:09] Baptist stood out there introduced the
[13:12] Messiah amen and he
[13:14] spoke all right
[13:17] now the prophet would have had to
[13:21] waited um some way of explaining what
[13:24] I'm talking
[13:25] about
[13:27] um
[13:29] brother brandom knew a lot of things may
[13:32] I approach it this
[13:33] way
[13:35] uh you can go back to the 64 questions
[13:38] and answers conduct order and Doctrine
[13:41] and you'll find him mentioning because
[13:43] he was questioned pretty highly right
[13:45] during that period of time about you
[13:48] know marriage and divorce all right and
[13:52] you'll find him there saying you know go
[13:55] on
[13:56] now don't don't do anything don't just
[13:58] just run out of here and do this should
[14:00] we do that should we do this he said
[14:02] don't do those things he said go on
[14:05] until you hear from me he says now
[14:08] there's been uh things in the Bible
[14:12] before that was made right paraphrasing
[14:15] it and said you know then just go ahead
[14:19] well when you get to the grace of
[14:22] marriage and divorce then you can go
[14:24] back and read and see that he could
[14:29] he was believing that there'd be a Grace
[14:32] Giver
[14:33] right now I believe he was I believe he
[14:37] had the scriptures CU that's what he
[14:38] said back about
[14:40] 62 somewhere along in there he said he
[14:44] had the scriptures on marriage and
[14:45] divorce he said bust every Church in the
[14:48] country all right see but then by doing
[14:53] that I believe he saw there would be a
[14:55] Grace
[14:57] given all right but see that's what
[14:59] people
[15:00] thinks they they think that well he saw
[15:03] a Grace would be given and he just speak
[15:05] it but you can't do
[15:08] that a prophet
[15:10] cannot come and bring something by
[15:16] presumption and the best you could do of
[15:19] thinking how great he was and how God
[15:20] had used him and that was wonderful but
[15:23] he could still not say anything about
[15:26] the grace of marriage and divorce course
[15:28] other than leave things alone don't try
[15:31] to figure it out you
[15:33] know because he would have been doing it
[15:38] presumptuously because remember the
[15:40] quote I gave this morning that the
[15:42] Messiah was to speak all right a prophet
[15:47] was assigned God was going to speak all
[15:50] right you say well he he knew about it
[15:53] what he knew about a lot of things right
[15:56] he knew a lot of the scriptures
[15:59] that related to a lot of the things but
[16:02] you can't go speak something
[16:06] presumptuously because even though you
[16:09] may have it lined up
[16:10] correctly it may not be time it may not
[16:14] be the right people it may not be
[16:17] according to what God wants to brought
[16:19] out you know so he
[16:23] waited you know and like I told you the
[16:26] other day I remember some of the older
[16:28] ones tell me about it you know that
[16:29] people are just running the country when
[16:31] brother randam mentioned marriage and
[16:32] divorce they would just running the
[16:34] country boy they was telling all about
[16:36] what this was and what that was and
[16:38] everything well he was just going on
[16:41] itself but then one day God spoke to
[16:44] him and when he spoke to him
[16:47] then he came and told us all right
[16:52] because that would put it to where it
[16:54] wouldn't be
[16:56] presumptuous all right now now we'll
[16:58] read this quote after a
[17:01] while that he
[17:03] said
[17:06] that because of the
[17:09] opening of The Seven
[17:13] Seals All
[17:16] right so now he put it into the
[17:20] seals and he tells us that in the Seals
[17:23] All Things was
[17:25] revealed right amen you know everything
[17:28] was revealed in the seals now there was
[17:30] a lot of things that he preached later
[17:32] uh a more depth greater understanding
[17:37] but it was revealed he even said the
[17:38] Rapture was revealed in the seals you
[17:41] know everything was there because
[17:42] because it's a seven seal book of
[17:44] redemption amen all right and he said
[17:46] because of the opening of The Seven
[17:49] Seals so look what he was waiting
[17:53] for and at the time that he was speaking
[17:56] of it in 64
[17:59] remember 63 the seals had done been
[18:01] broke
[18:02] right but that still didn't give him a
[18:04] right to just go out and
[18:08] speak he had to wait until God told
[18:12] him
[18:14] well you
[18:16] know see then in doing
[18:20] that we may get presumptuously about
[18:23] what we
[18:25] think but yet can we keep it with the
[18:28] word of the Lord you know what about the
[18:32] grace of marriage and divorce what do
[18:33] you think about it
[18:35] right now we know for certain that he
[18:38] said and I had the quotes this morning
[18:40] just giving but he said on a is this a
[18:44] sign of the end he was speaking and he
[18:46] said one of the um how many it was so
[18:50] many of the Mysteries that was there and
[18:52] he said one of them was true Grace
[18:54] straightened
[18:56] out well it evidently must have been all
[18:59] messed
[19:00] up and that was kind of the line I was
[19:03] doing this morning trying to get it to
[19:05] where we wouldn't think that its works
[19:07] or we wouldn't think it was this that it
[19:09] was you know it's always been the grace
[19:11] of God right all right and God gave the
[19:15] lamb you know his grace uh he sent the
[19:18] prophet his
[19:19] grace uh that wasn't all he done he came
[19:22] down
[19:24] himself all right now I believe
[19:29] that this prophet's
[19:31] message is that that zerubabel is
[19:34] speaking of
[19:36] Amen you know or typing in zeruel that
[19:41] Zachariah that it would The Headstone
[19:43] would come crying Grace
[19:45] Grace now I'm not looking for something
[19:49] else to
[19:50] come right you may
[19:53] be uh I'm not looking for another
[19:57] prophet
[20:00] another time or another
[20:02] doings all right cuz you're getting your
[20:05] numbers all messed up for one thing but
[20:07] still in just plain
[20:09] language
[20:12] um I think we need to believe what we've
[20:14] already received and take that and walk
[20:19] therein yes sir all right and see then
[20:22] believe in what he says I can't vary
[20:25] from that right you know amen because if
[20:28] I do I am becoming presumptuous right
[20:32] you know and you got people that come
[20:34] along you know well that brother boy he
[20:36] preached it right down the line he had
[20:37] it all straightened out I I remember
[20:39] years ago brother mod and I were
[20:41] listening to a certain brother and he
[20:43] was preaching right down the line and he
[20:45] done a wonderful
[20:47] job but when he got down to the end of
[20:49] the
[20:50] message he
[20:52] married Israel or God back to
[20:55] Israel you know when he was taking them
[20:57] out and brother Mo looked at me and I
[21:00] looked at him we came out later and said
[21:02] he missed
[21:03] Happ it didn't matter his whole hour and
[21:05] a half was lined up real good but when
[21:08] he finished it he put into words what he
[21:13] was thinking so then basically he was
[21:15] probably wrong the whole thought because
[21:18] he was lining up to that point to talk
[21:21] about it because God will not marry
[21:22] Israel
[21:24] back because she was put away and he
[21:26] will not do that the 44,000 comes back
[21:29] to be
[21:30] Unix uh even the filal Jew Etc they do
[21:34] not come into the bases of being the
[21:37] bride of Christ all right now because
[21:40] they turned that down all right but
[21:44] see we talk about
[21:48] Grace and we see that Grace is a
[21:54] revelation right well that's why I say
[21:57] that you you can't and why brother
[21:58] brandham would say this is for my people
[22:04] only all right see I've had to get on to
[22:07] people here sometime go out and they say
[22:09] well I went and told so and so about the
[22:11] grace of marriage and divorce well they
[22:13] don't even know one God they don't even
[22:15] know anything about the prophet's
[22:16] message how are you going to do it you
[22:18] going to print it in gl's Aline and send
[22:20] it out or you know put it on the
[22:23] internet and let everybody read it and
[22:26] no it's only
[22:28] for the Bride of Jesus Christ all right
[22:33] and I say to truly understand it it is
[22:37] only for the elect out of the
[22:40] elect maybe that's the wrong way to say
[22:43] it but I simply mean by if it is what he
[22:48] said because of the opening of The Seven
[22:51] Seals then I ask you the
[22:54] question how are you going to understand
[22:57] it
[22:58] without the opening of The Seven
[23:01] Seals
[23:03] amen I mean that's a simple question
[23:05] I've always ask because I'm totally
[23:08] simply M simple minded and and I stay
[23:11] simple that way I don't mean we have to
[23:15] understand everything brother randam
[23:16] taught in the seal book I've never never
[23:18] made nothing like that but you get
[23:20] somebody and they just come in the
[23:22] message and you oh you've heard of The
[23:24] Grace no let them sit down and listen a
[23:27] while amen right you might find just
[23:29] save you time a lot of talking because
[23:32] the biggest portion of them is going to
[23:33] get up and run out anyway once you start
[23:35] laying down the things that the prophet
[23:37] has taught right so you save you a lot
[23:41] of trouble so the best thing to do is
[23:43] just leave it
[23:44] alone uh I never talk to people in the
[23:47] message about marriage and
[23:49] divorce until they get
[23:52] settled right in what they're doing
[23:55] because there's no need of it that's
[23:57] right you're
[23:58] confusing
[24:00] yep because you're they're they're
[24:03] trying to get a false
[24:05] hope and what good is a false hope I
[24:08] want something that I can anchor in the
[24:10] word of God and I say for my own self
[24:13] you can think whatever but when I
[24:17] preached in 82 and ' 83 the seals back
[24:19] there during that series that time I
[24:21] could actually see within the the the
[24:24] confines of the message of the opening
[24:27] of the fth seal and I could actually see
[24:30] where a prophet and the grace stood
[24:32] forth and and the things because it
[24:34] began to be revealed to me all
[24:38] right I I believe that through the
[24:42] opening of the
[24:44] word will come to you and I an
[24:49] understanding that by that understanding
[24:52] we
[24:55] can survive in this day Orly live
[24:59] because most of the people are not
[25:01] surviving they're just going to church
[25:03] and being good and and they don't want
[25:05] you to talk about the things of the
[25:07] seals or anything like that they they
[25:10] just want to well let's just keep it
[25:12] simple well simple can become
[25:15] stupid you know because that's what it
[25:18] is you know
[25:21] but see what do you think about
[25:25] Grace I believe
[25:28] as I was stating I believe the prophet
[25:30] understood the Bible don't you
[25:33] amen I believe he had the understanding
[25:37] I'm talking about there before the
[25:39] before the even the uh the grace was
[25:41] given I believe he had to understanding
[25:45] of things that would be given that's
[25:47] right but he couldn't state
[25:50] that until God gave it cuz you're
[25:53] missing the quote that I said this
[25:56] morning a prophet it is a sign that the
[25:59] Messiah is going to speak amen
[26:02] right right now I I hope you understand
[26:05] this statement if you think that brother
[26:08] brandham gave you the
[26:10] grace right you know I think that
[26:15] over because there's no way a prophet
[26:18] can't do
[26:19] it he only spoke of the
[26:22] grace he could only bring to us the
[26:25] understanding of Grace God has to
[26:30] reveal Amen to you and I that's right
[26:33] and I believe that it's revealed to
[26:36] individuals you
[26:38] know and you say well well it's been
[26:40] revealed to me that brother so and so is
[26:42] all right well that's all right I'm not
[26:45] going to argue with you uh I'd rather
[26:49] have a revelation I'm all right right
[26:52] you know uh I'm kind of
[26:54] selfish let brother so and so take care
[26:56] of himself
[26:58] you know let him go dig it out somewhere
[27:01] I'm kind of selfish I come one with
[27:03] myself they used to laugh at me we'd go
[27:05] to Jeffersonville you've heard me i' I'd
[27:07] go down through there and I'd make sure
[27:08] when we got up there we got a book CU
[27:11] I'd go down through there and I'd take
[27:13] the books out of the boxes that the
[27:15] people was passing out cuz when we went
[27:17] we got a book well I've always been a
[27:19] Jacob on that style I guess that you
[27:22] know I won't watch mine all right now if
[27:25] I can help you along on the way that's
[27:29] wonderful I'm like brother Tatum was
[27:32] when first time we went to his house
[27:33] after coming into the message you know
[27:35] and and U he said brother Dale he said
[27:39] in that cabinet is two copies of
[27:41] everything brother bram's we can get up
[27:43] to now he said you you just sit down
[27:47] there and you take you one and leave me
[27:48] one well that was wonderful I got about
[27:51] 80
[27:53] books you know and then I went back and
[27:56] got every what he had and U the only
[28:00] problem we had I wound up getting one of
[28:02] them he didn't have two of so I had to
[28:04] order him one but my point was that was
[28:07] wonderful to
[28:08] me he was giving me something that help
[28:12] me you know well then why are we not
[28:17] concerned with trying to help people by
[28:20] giving them everything we
[28:22] can to help them you know and all like
[28:26] that and doing the best we can do to
[28:28] teach the message in the Purity that the
[28:32] prophet brought
[28:34] it you know
[28:37] because you know then it would be based
[28:39] upon
[28:41] that of what you and I could
[28:45] receive go remember now it's got to be
[28:48] revealed to
[28:49] you see a lot of people say it was
[28:51] revealed to brother
[28:53] brandham and that's it oh that's
[28:56] wonderful that was brother br
[28:57] that's
[28:59] right but if it ain't revealed to me and
[29:02] you all right and I I'm blunt plain I
[29:07] don't believe brother random can reveal
[29:09] anything to
[29:10] you all right now even brother brandom
[29:14] uses it and said Jesus said my own life
[29:16] didn't reveal that unto thee so then the
[29:19] life of Jesus couldn't reveal it to you
[29:21] that's
[29:22] right it takes God to reveal well the
[29:25] most important thing we need is
[29:28] what what did he say what we needed more
[29:31] than anything else the baptism of the
[29:32] Holy Ghost we need the inside
[29:36] teacher or else we just get mentally
[29:40] what is
[29:43] said but we need the inside teacher all
[29:47] right so then thinking about it and it
[29:50] was trying to to say this morning a
[29:51] little bit see God sent a
[29:55] prophet look what would happen happened
[29:58] had we stayed with the first
[30:01] plan you
[30:03] know for God to send a
[30:05] prophet now there was none of us looking
[30:07] for a prophet to come I've told you my
[30:11] experience you know and I I believe it
[30:14] cuz I just tell it the first time I read
[30:17] the Bible when I was in the Baptist
[30:18] Church about 18 years old and you know
[30:21] and I've accepted Jesus Christ as my
[30:24] savior there in the Baptist Church and I
[30:27] set out to read the
[30:28] Bible Well when I read Malachi 3 and
[30:31] Malachi
[30:32] 4 I told my wife I said it looks like
[30:35] there going to be two prophets come well
[30:37] I was just reading the
[30:39] letter or the word well when brother Mo
[30:43] began to talk to me about it you know
[30:45] and he said you don't we supposed to
[30:47] have a prophet I said now us Baptist we
[30:51] don't lay too much on them
[30:53] prophets uh we take a teacher we take an
[30:56] evangelist and you know in in in a
[30:59] pastor but we don't talk about prophets
[31:02] and and and things like that you know
[31:05] and I said now you going to have to put
[31:07] it in the
[31:10] word he said well okay right here it is
[31:14] Malachi
[31:16] 4
[31:18] well the question to him was I said
[31:21] that's good I didn't tell him that what
[31:24] I had thought about you know and
[31:26] thinking two prophets would come but I
[31:29] said uh now what about this other one
[31:31] right here in Malachi 3 well see I'm
[31:33] glad that I ran into somebody that had
[31:36] enough bases in the word of God to
[31:37] explain the word of God to me instead of
[31:40] you just got to believe it it don't
[31:42] matter what you got to believe it well I
[31:44] want it anchored in this
[31:46] word all right so he said here's Malachi
[31:49] 3 I said yeah but according to our
[31:52] understanding you you got Malachi 3 and
[31:54] Luke 11:17 you got you know we went
[31:56] through the scriptures back and forth
[31:57] cuz I studied the Bible back then and he
[32:01] said well that's right he said that was
[32:03] John the Baptist but said now where's
[32:06] this other one I said well okay you got
[32:10] a point now we talk you know and I told
[32:13] him I said you've seen the dead raised
[32:15] the sick heal the things happened in the
[32:18] ministry but I said I wasn't
[32:20] there you tell me what he taught in the
[32:25] Bible and I'll know know whether or not
[32:28] he was a prophet because of what the
[32:31] Bible
[32:33] says so I thank God I run into the right
[32:35] man was able to do that you know to
[32:38] express not just you got to believe it
[32:40] right you know you got to believe this
[32:42] you got to believe that no he could base
[32:44] it in the word all right see I believe
[32:48] that the whole Bible is God's grace to
[32:56] mankind you know it's even Grace for for
[32:59] the
[33:00] U sinner to be
[33:07] destroyed you thinking with me what if
[33:10] he kept on being
[33:13] burned are you
[33:15] listening what if hell was
[33:19] eternal no the grace of God stops it
[33:22] from being Eternal right and makes it to
[33:26] the basis that
[33:27] it's going to end one day right well you
[33:30] know a it ain't too bad see then I can
[33:33] take anything in the Bible and I can go
[33:36] back and read it and I relate to God's
[33:41] grace you know to where that I can
[33:44] follow it through there and see that
[33:47] there were certain things happen like we
[33:49] talking about this morning RAB the
[33:52] Harlot married to Israeli General right
[33:56] out of there
[33:57] came down to
[33:59] David and right down to what you call
[34:02] the Earthly lineages well you
[34:06] know God has made a way on a lot of
[34:11] things but I still go back to what I'm
[34:13] talking about the prophet knew those
[34:16] things greater than you and I knew them
[34:19] right
[34:21] amen but yet still he couldn't go out
[34:24] there and say it
[34:29] do you realize what thus sayith the Lord
[34:34] is you know it's thousands of times in
[34:37] the Bible do you realize what thus
[34:38] sayith the Lord
[34:41] is
[34:42] that's uh carnally speaking one person
[34:45] telling another person what to
[34:49] say if a Prophet come out and said thus
[34:52] sayith the Lord it wasn't thus sayith
[34:54] Jeremiah he was telling you what God
[34:57] Said that is thus sayth the Lord that's
[35:01] all
[35:02] right and thousands of times it was in
[35:04] the Bible of the thus sayith the Lord
[35:06] right that God was using man and that's
[35:08] what I said this morning and we're
[35:10] quoting
[35:11] what when a prophet
[35:16] speaks was you listening it means God is
[35:20] going to
[35:22] speak all right he said thus sayith the
[35:25] Lord
[35:28] that meant God told him what to
[35:32] say that's why even balam says I cannot
[35:36] say anything contrary to what God has
[35:39] told
[35:43] me but see Jesus never said thus say
[35:50] Lord it was the Lord himself
[35:53] talking all right now we don't make
[35:56] brother random
[36:00] God and I know he would say on marriage
[36:03] and divorce this is thus sayth the Lord
[36:05] or something you
[36:08] know but
[36:11] remember he's standing in the place of
[36:14] God
[36:17] Amen um so close until it's hard to
[36:21] distinguish and I understand why people
[36:23] would make try to make brother Ram God
[36:25] you know and want worship Him and and
[36:27] all like that if you'd been there with
[36:29] him uh to live day by day and everything
[36:32] happen you know and turn around fishing
[36:34] and get him over here he told you all
[36:36] the things you would uh you know you'd
[36:39] think a
[36:41] lot but
[36:42] yet Brother D what are you talking about
[36:44] I'm talking about the the
[36:51] uh things that would be the greatest of
[36:55] all is for us to
[36:58] believe that God can speak to
[37:02] us that doesn't do you any good to think
[37:05] about the grace of marriage and
[37:08] divorce to think about now listen to my
[37:11] word I'm sorry I'm just human uh he had
[37:15] to speak through the prophet but that's
[37:17] going to do no
[37:18] good until he speaks to
[37:22] you
[37:24] right this C the prophet even called
[37:27] maybe your name but just remember what
[37:29] that Prophet said he says there's many
[37:32] William
[37:34] Brams and he says just because the Bible
[37:37] would say William brandham he said I
[37:39] can't go that way he said I'd rather
[37:42] have whosoever will of course in the
[37:46] message they don't like that oh it's not
[37:48] whosoever will we are the seed you know
[37:51] all right SE it on to death
[37:55] but
[37:57] do you believe God has spoken to
[38:04] us now he's spoken to us by way of the
[38:07] Prophet right amen we'll all anchor on
[38:10] that right
[38:13] amen but what do you think about him
[38:15] speaking to
[38:17] you now we got to make sure we do like
[38:20] we did this morning about making sure
[38:21] it's not
[38:24] misunderstood if a voice speaks to you a
[38:27] great shining Angel a great Glory
[38:30] Hallelujah with a holy holy Halos and
[38:33] all of the things and it says something
[38:35] contrary to the
[38:41] Bible we are not supposed to listen to
[38:44] that
[38:45] voice even God himself said I have sent
[38:48] that to try
[38:49] you you know which means he would allow
[38:52] it to happen that's right we see great
[38:54] shining angels we see all of these these
[38:56] things and we say a voice spoke to
[39:00] me you know well
[39:05] okay but if it's not according to the
[39:12] word
[39:14] then what good is
[39:18] it the Bible says speaking what
[39:21] according to the law and the prophets
[39:25] right if it doesn't tally up with the
[39:28] word what good is your Revelation or my
[39:34] Revelation see what brother Dale I think
[39:36] it's so and
[39:37] so
[39:40] okay that's all right if it
[39:42] is but if it ain't what do we
[39:46] got yeah but you don't believe yeah I
[39:49] believe I believe in God speaking to
[39:53] people right I do
[39:57] a lot of people think that God only
[39:58] spoke to the
[40:00] prophet well my Bible's full of a lot of
[40:03] little people that ain't called prophets
[40:04] that God talked to I don't know about
[40:07] yours but you know that God spoke to
[40:11] people so I believe God can
[40:14] speak to
[40:17] people but I believe we can take
[40:20] that and not only misinterpret it but we
[40:23] can you know apply it wrong we can do
[40:25] what we want to with it and we come out
[40:27] with our own ideas
[40:31] right all
[40:33] right God was standing on Earth speaking
[40:36] to
[40:38] mankind that all they done all their
[40:40] life was studi the word of God that's
[40:43] right
[40:45] right and when it wound up did they
[40:48] believe
[40:51] him
[40:54] no well
[40:57] there must be
[40:58] a place a point or something that we can
[41:02] all find to anchor
[41:06] down and
[41:08] believe all
[41:10] right and then we say well well you know
[41:13] just go out and tell the world about the
[41:16] grace doesn't do any good it's not for
[41:20] that's
[41:22] right but now it's only for the one that
[41:25] can be revealed
[41:29] to I believe Grace must be
[41:33] revealed I believe that brother brandham
[41:35] says on
[41:37] uh it's in the church age one of them
[41:40] not in the church age one of the
[41:41] book he said the only way you can be
[41:44] saved is by
[41:48] Revelation I don't believe you're saved
[41:50] because you intellectually can say
[41:52] something and quote something or
[41:54] whatever you talk about you believing
[41:59] right I believe that according to the
[42:02] prophet that it must be
[42:06] revealed to us that we're
[42:11] saved well I just take it by
[42:13] faith all right like I asked you last
[42:17] night a
[42:18] question I asked a simple question to
[42:21] the group last night that we were and it
[42:24] was an odd question
[42:27] but I asked the question I said
[42:31] uh to make sure we're
[42:36] right and don't raise your hand either
[42:38] way cuz you you
[42:42] know but I said how many of you would be
[42:45] willing to get baptized again in the
[42:47] name of the Lord Jesus
[42:53] Christ well a lot of lives not raise
[42:55] their hand and they would you know and I
[42:57] believe it
[42:59] uh but you'd say well well why would you
[43:02] want to do that could I done be baptized
[43:05] yeah I have too three times father son
[43:07] Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ and then
[43:09] the River Jordan and Lord Jesus Christ
[43:12] if I went back I'd get another one you
[43:16] know it wouldn't mean that I was
[43:18] doubting what I had
[43:21] right it would just mean I'd go do it
[43:24] again right but see everybody's so set
[43:28] don't tell me I got to get baptized
[43:30] again I didn't tell you you had to I
[43:33] asked you was you certain enough to know
[43:35] where you stand to where that you can
[43:37] stand on what you
[43:40] got and like I told you I have here
[43:42] baptized people again that were baptized
[43:45] but some of them was baptized in the
[43:46] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[43:49] yeah but they was baptized under
[43:55] regeneration
[43:58] no if I was baptized under regeneration
[44:01] I would want to get baptized again
[44:04] because my thoughts would been related
[44:06] to Regeneration not related to whether I
[44:08] was right or
[44:09] not but I'm just I'm
[44:14] serious we say but I can't deny the Lord
[44:18] I done been baptized one time I didn't
[44:20] say you had to be I just asked a simple
[44:23] question of the sincerity of your
[44:28] heart would you be willing to go back
[44:30] and get baptized
[44:33] again well then I'll say to you why
[44:35] wouldn't
[44:36] you I've been baptized before now your
[44:39] actions and reactions shows there's
[44:41] something
[44:42] wrong because if your actions and
[44:44] reaction says well
[44:51] okay CU it ain't going to save you
[44:54] anyway
[44:58] but see what I'm getting at is if we
[45:02] believe this
[45:04] Bible to be the word of
[45:09] God why wouldn't our sincerity be to the
[45:12] basis that we want to follow that and
[45:16] believe
[45:17] it and look back in it and just follow
[45:21] it all the way
[45:22] through and see that that never was a
[45:25] Book of
[45:28] Rules it never was anything like
[45:32] that it's always been the revelation of
[45:35] Jesus
[45:37] Christ even in the Old
[45:41] Testament can I quote brother
[45:43] Brandon he said if you read the Bible
[45:45] and don't say see Jesus in the reverse
[45:47] now ain't talking about the Bible of the
[45:49] body is he no he said if you don't see
[45:51] Jesus in every reverse or the Christ he
[45:54] said need to go back and read it again
[45:56] cuz you missed it all right see that way
[45:59] I can believe Hebrews
[46:02] 13:8 and see that he's the same that's
[46:06] right then I can see grace throughout
[46:09] the entire
[46:12] Bible as I said in this zerubabel see it
[46:16] means Prince with
[46:19] God and in doing it see he brings
[46:24] forth
[46:27] y
[46:30] right Christ brings forth these things
[46:33] and see you can put it right over into
[46:35] brother R's Ministry and you can see
[46:37] what was taking
[46:39] place and a man that grew in Grace and
[46:43] knowledge for all of those years until
[46:45] he come to a
[46:47] place
[46:49] that he could
[46:52] say going as you
[46:54] are
[46:59] now that's beyond thus sayith the
[47:04] Lord are you going to listen with me for
[47:06] a minute
[47:08] now we know Moses gave a Grace right
[47:12] we'll read it in the
[47:14] message you know that that Grace that
[47:16] was given to Moses now listen to what
[47:19] I'm
[47:20] saying God didn't have to say thus
[47:23] sayith the Lord to
[47:24] him he spoke it from his
[47:27] own
[47:31] Revelation you don't hear over in
[47:33] Corinthians where Paul is given the
[47:35] grace that he says thus sayith the
[47:39] Lord he says I
[47:44] say that's
[47:48] true so was the prophet dealing with did
[47:51] he had to have you know was he saying
[47:53] well now wait a minute and I know he did
[47:56] that's the way he was even to uh I miss
[47:59] this I get it right I think was sister
[48:00] had it
[48:01] right were he seen that she could not
[48:04] get it as to what he was saying about
[48:07] say anything you know and I'll speak it
[48:10] behind
[48:13] you you know what he stopped and said he
[48:15] said no sister had it right he said
[48:17] that's thus sayith the Lord cuz see he
[48:19] knew she needed something to Anchor it
[48:24] into so he didn't have any problems
[48:27] going back because it was thus sayeth
[48:30] the
[48:32] Lord but Moses didn't have to come out
[48:35] thus sayith the Lord this is right no he
[48:38] gave the
[48:40] grace
[48:43] right he gave the grace that went
[48:47] there all Paul didn't have to come out
[48:50] and say thus sayith the
[48:52] Lord no he gave the
[48:54] grace and brother Brandon spoke
[48:57] it he said I
[49:05] say that was greater than thus sayith
[49:08] the
[49:09] Lord because that was God himself coming
[49:14] through a man's
[49:17] thinking and would that be any different
[49:20] to what uh David could saying they
[49:22] pierced my hands and my feet or whatever
[49:28] when he had entered into the spirit
[49:29] realm so close until he was speaking in
[49:32] the first
[49:37] person but think about
[49:40] it I hope you understand the layout that
[49:42] I'm making
[49:44] that I don't believe that just anybody
[49:47] in this message can understand marriage
[49:49] and divorce you know just coming in and
[49:51] just believing and
[49:54] starting
[49:56] but that's what everybody wants that's
[49:59] why you see such of
[50:01] problems you
[50:03] know but I ask you the question you say
[50:07] brother Dale I've accepted the grace of
[50:09] marriage and divorce well
[50:13] okay now may I quote it this
[50:18] way it's not whether I accept him or
[50:24] not
[50:26] right that's right it's whether he
[50:28] accepts me or
[50:30] not that's a different
[50:33] story mean I can accept him as my savior
[50:38] but has he accepted
[50:41] me see then the new birth is a
[50:47] revelation and like I said a lot of
[50:49] people believe that their marital
[50:51] situation was done Away by the new birth
[50:54] now I do not believe that
[50:56] that I don't believe it because why
[50:58] would the prophet have to give a Grace
[51:00] if it was already done away he would
[51:02] have just told us we were all right by
[51:03] the new
[51:04] birth but that's what people want to
[51:06] shortcut
[51:09] everything we want out we want our
[51:15] ideas and try to take the Bible and make
[51:17] it fit our ideas instead of taking our
[51:20] ideas and putting them aside and taking
[51:23] What God Says
[51:26] you remember what we were there the
[51:28] other week that you know they asked
[51:30] Jesus can a man put away his wife for
[51:33] every
[51:35] cause cuz that's what they were doing
[51:37] they were just you
[51:39] know but that was not using the grace of
[51:43] marriage and
[51:48] divorce just because you say you believe
[51:50] in grace doesn't mean you're
[51:54] right
[51:56] right see they were a people that said
[51:59] well okay forever
[52:01] cause which meant they just for anything
[52:05] they
[52:06] needed well did that make it
[52:10] right another
[52:13] example I don't believe everybody that
[52:15] took a lamb up to an altar and laid it
[52:18] down and said kill that lamb for me I
[52:20] don't believe they were
[52:23] forgiven right
[52:29] I believe there's got to be a little
[52:30] word called
[52:32] sincerity that goes along with
[52:36] that you sincerely went up there
[52:40] believing
[52:41] it then God will forgive you but if you
[52:44] just go upart and just throw it down and
[52:45] say well I'm doing what Moses told me to
[52:49] do that don't make you right I don't
[52:53] believe everybody that says Jesus Jesus
[52:55] is saved that's right the prophet said
[52:58] you can call him Jesus Jesus and worship
[53:01] the
[53:02] devil that's getting pretty
[53:07] rough well see I don't believe you can
[53:10] accept the grace of marriage and divorce
[53:12] if you do not have the new
[53:18] birth so why deal with the grace of
[53:21] trying to tell everybody about how how
[53:24] they can do this or that other why not
[53:25] deal with him about getting born again
[53:28] right
[53:32] right and see by getting born again then
[53:34] you can come to a place that you can
[53:37] receive
[53:38] more but if you're not born
[53:42] again look where you
[53:45] laughed so the prophet said the most
[53:47] important thing in the world is whether
[53:49] we're born again or not
[53:51] right all
[53:53] right but you see
[53:55] there's a there's got to be a
[53:58] layout if you followed me through the
[54:00] prophet didn't just come out in the
[54:03] 50s the 60s and say these
[54:08] things and even after he said he had the
[54:12] scriptures which I
[54:14] believe that he understood they'd be
[54:18] Grace you know because he could see if
[54:20] he see if he had the scriptures he had
[54:21] Moses and and and uh Paul
[54:26] if he had the scriptures about
[54:28] it but yet you can't just come out and
[54:30] say
[54:34] something because that's going beyond
[54:36] the the point that you're supposed to be
[54:38] you're you're you're supposed to be you
[54:41] know waiting on
[54:44] God and see people come to me and say
[54:47] brother there what do you think about
[54:48] this I said wait a minute now I can't do
[54:50] that I don't how see grace is not a
[54:52] blanket that
[54:54] just
[54:56] you know
[54:57] right see the new birth is not just a
[55:00] blanket just anybody oh you believe this
[55:03] message that means you're born again and
[55:06] you believe this message I'll quote
[55:07] brother Bram he said that's ability to
[55:09] read is that what he said about it all
[55:13] right that's right but you see have
[55:19] you ask God to reveal it to you
[55:24] amen
[55:26] well he revealed it to the prophet
[55:28] well okay we got that
[55:31] settled prophet got it we got that
[55:33] settled now what about me and
[55:36] you have you ever asked God to reveal to
[55:39] you that you're
[55:43] saved now you know what I put right
[55:45] there always right I had rather go
[55:48] through life seeking after
[55:52] God and praying for him to give give me
[55:55] these
[55:59] things then to go through life not
[56:02] seeking
[56:07] God CU if one day he says hey you've had
[56:11] it you remember the prophet when the the
[56:13] guy came you know went to different
[56:15] places and everything you know finally
[56:16] come to brother Bram and he said who
[56:19] said you had it all the
[56:21] time
[56:23] right he said when you read that track
[56:26] said it was settled right
[56:28] there well you know what man needed a
[56:31] revelation didn't
[56:34] he but R around didn't condemn him for
[56:37] seeking
[56:41] God why can't we seek God brother Dale
[56:45] do you seek God for the new
[56:48] birth more a m new
[56:51] birth I thought we believed a statue of
[56:53] perfect man that we were to grow in
[56:54] Grace a knowledge I thought that went in
[56:56] the
[56:58] message see I'm trying to get a point
[57:01] about
[57:03] Grace and to think about the marriage
[57:05] and divorce
[57:07] situation I've went through many weeks
[57:12] explaining that there was a lot of
[57:14] people that didn't need the grace of
[57:15] marriage and divorce because it wasn't
[57:18] guilty if you got a scriptural reason
[57:20] for doing things then you're not
[57:23] guilty right
[57:25] the word sets you free that's
[57:29] right but then see there's a lot there
[57:33] that knowingly openly admittingly know
[57:35] that they was wrong in what they
[57:38] done now you're getting to the basis of
[57:41] talking about the
[57:45] grace and remember my point Grace is not
[57:48] for the
[57:51] future don't ask God to forgive you what
[57:54] you plan on doing that kind of gets into
[57:59] Catholicism you don't want to do
[58:02] that is asking God to forgive you what
[58:04] you
[58:06] done
[58:08] now I'll say it this way I believe
[58:13] Grace and you going to argue me right
[58:16] here so go
[58:17] ahead I believe Grace is a one- time
[58:23] thing
[58:25] maybe You' never considered that
[58:27] thought I'm just honest I tell you what
[58:30] I believe at least you can decide what
[58:33] you believe
[58:35] by I don't believe Grace is something
[58:38] that I can use today and then turn
[58:40] around tomorrow and reuse
[58:48] it cuz if You' done that way you'd say
[58:51] well I used it here then I'll go do what
[58:53] I want to and I'll just use it again
[58:58] no no the prophet made it plain amen go
[59:02] on his
[59:03] yard but Heaven Happ you if you do it
[59:07] again
[59:09] why because you're using up your
[59:18] grace now I do not mean that it's a one
[59:20] time of fire on a bases that you've been
[59:22] married three times and it only gets rid
[59:24] of one wife I didn't say that uh got a
[59:27] little more
[59:28] sense but it's a one-time
[59:31] thing to be
[59:36] used well I mean you know I used it and
[59:39] I just go use it
[59:41] again
[59:42] now
[59:45] uh-uh let's don't go into the wrong
[59:47] category okay
[59:50] am my salvation was for one
[59:53] thing to save
[59:56] me I didn't get lost again and have to
[1:00:00] be saved
[1:00:02] again is for one
[1:00:04] time right see then my point is if I can
[1:00:09] receive the grace of marriage and
[1:00:12] divorce I needed it you know and can
[1:00:14] receive
[1:00:15] it that's
[1:00:17] wonderful because it was
[1:00:20] supplied but why would I want to go back
[1:00:24] and do other
[1:00:28] things you
[1:00:31] know I'm as truthful as I can be plain
[1:00:35] but
[1:00:37] truthful if I seen right today that uh I
[1:00:41] had some way in my life we're not all
[1:00:44] perfect but I'm just saying if I'd have
[1:00:46] been married before and you
[1:00:50] know and things then I just walk out of
[1:00:54] this
[1:00:55] pullit you think that' bother me
[1:00:59] no you know if I had a marital problem
[1:01:01] that made me to where I wasn't supposed
[1:01:04] to be
[1:01:04] preaching I have a bit of trouble
[1:01:06] sitting
[1:01:10] down I mean that'd be an
[1:01:12] enjoyment number one I'd be listening to
[1:01:15] somebody
[1:01:20] else I wouldn't be having to stay up and
[1:01:22] get up at 6:00 this morning well you
[1:01:25] were still sleeping and I was up at 6
[1:01:26] trying to get things together you know I
[1:01:30] could have enjoyed myself right you
[1:01:33] women you mean it's a problem for you
[1:01:35] sisters to realize you're not supposed
[1:01:37] to
[1:01:40] preach you mean that's a I feel like I'm
[1:01:43] supposed to
[1:01:45] be I believe I'm supposed to be
[1:01:49] preaching and somebody come along and
[1:01:51] say
[1:01:52] nope you ain't called you can't tell me
[1:01:55] I ain't called God called me that's why
[1:01:59] brother around and told him he said I'm
[1:02:00] not going to tell that lady that God
[1:02:02] didn't call her you remember that he
[1:02:06] said but I'm going to tell you it's not
[1:02:07] according to the
[1:02:11] word you know what that meant to me then
[1:02:13] God didn't call
[1:02:16] her is that the way you think if it's
[1:02:19] not according to the word God didn't
[1:02:20] call her now she heard
[1:02:23] voices you know you know she heard
[1:02:26] things talking to
[1:02:28] her but it wasn't God cuz he can't break
[1:02:31] his
[1:02:32] word and that's that's why to me see
[1:02:35] grace is a one thing of fire if I've got
[1:02:37] Grace for what's taken care of what that
[1:02:40] I've
[1:02:41] done why do I want to be concerned with
[1:02:44] anything any
[1:02:52] further let me be happy what I
[1:02:55] am you
[1:02:58] know and that way then I can say well
[1:03:01] thank
[1:03:02] God I believe in his grac amen amen he
[1:03:08] set me
[1:03:10] free what would I be concerned about
[1:03:13] well he may me free n now then I'll go
[1:03:16] find me another one and then he'll Set
[1:03:18] Me Free
[1:03:19] again yeah
[1:03:22] M don't work out too good that's
[1:03:25] right but now I've said to them to say
[1:03:28] this just a little bit because the other
[1:03:31] day it just doned on me something
[1:03:33] because of studying for this long time
[1:03:35] about these things
[1:03:39] but it just really doned on
[1:03:43] me that Grace sent a
[1:03:46] prophet you know and I've always
[1:03:49] believed that but I mean it just
[1:03:50] something begin to open
[1:03:53] up
[1:03:56] God sent a prophet that was his
[1:03:59] grace well now why wouldn't I want to
[1:04:01] believe what that Prophet
[1:04:03] said but it's like I told you now you
[1:04:06] know you you got the people in the
[1:04:07] message you're always straighten brother
[1:04:08] ran them out right he was wrong here and
[1:04:11] he was wrong there and the dates is off
[1:04:12] here and the dates off there but I've
[1:04:14] never heard one of them say he was wrong
[1:04:16] on marriage and divorce have
[1:04:20] you have you ever heard any preacher in
[1:04:22] this message say that brother Brown was
[1:04:24] wrong on marriage and divorce no he's
[1:04:26] going to hold on to
[1:04:29] that well how can you hold on to that
[1:04:33] when you've done throwed away everything
[1:04:39] else the qualifications for for God to
[1:04:42] be able to use the man to
[1:04:45] speak we was listening to him the other
[1:04:47] night you know remember where he was
[1:04:49] talking like this he said people say
[1:04:50] well brother random you know when he's
[1:04:52] under the anoint something paraphrasing
[1:04:54] it when he's under the anointing you
[1:04:55] know he's a prophet but said when he
[1:04:57] stepped back he said now how carnal
[1:05:00] could you be he said not realizing that
[1:05:03] a prophet means a
[1:05:07] diviner you know a revealer of God's
[1:05:11] Divine
[1:05:12] word but this is wrong but this is right
[1:05:15] well you know what we needed to follow
[1:05:18] you
[1:05:21] right because you'd be the one that
[1:05:23] could straighten brother I'm
[1:05:25] out well you know where I stand on that
[1:05:27] so you
[1:05:29] know but I was thinking about he started
[1:05:32] with a
[1:05:34] prophet now I know he he dealt with him
[1:05:36] with it atonement I know that now
[1:05:38] because that's a type of
[1:05:40] Christ right but his first Contact
[1:05:43] physically which would relate to
[1:05:47] flesh was through His
[1:05:49] prophets all
[1:05:53] right and then we wind up in the end
[1:05:55] time with God sending a
[1:05:58] prophet
[1:06:01] right see then he begins his ways and
[1:06:04] ends his ways on what he
[1:06:10] wanted and he began with Moses as I said
[1:06:13] that had went beyond the point of thus
[1:06:15] sayeth the
[1:06:17] Lord go just picking up to there cuz he
[1:06:20] used Noah he used Enoch he used the
[1:06:23] prophet
[1:06:26] for the message of their day but brother
[1:06:28] brand just kind of brings it over to
[1:06:30] Moses because of showing because he was
[1:06:32] a lawgiver he was all kind of type and
[1:06:36] uh here you come to
[1:06:39] Moses and
[1:06:41] Moses is able to
[1:06:45] write
[1:06:47] speak the thoughts of almighty
[1:06:52] God to bring it from from God's thoughts
[1:06:55] in his
[1:06:56] mind down to
[1:07:02] Mankind and I I was thinking about that
[1:07:05] and I read this and it really just
[1:07:06] struck on me so
[1:07:09] brother pull up number 17 let's just
[1:07:12] read something on marriage and divorce
[1:07:15] you
[1:07:17] know and let's just see what brother
[1:07:19] Bram had to say about something here
[1:07:22] that to me was really an outstanding
[1:07:24] thing and it just made everything open
[1:07:26] up go ahead and roll it on
[1:07:29] up and if God our creator was questioned
[1:07:32] the question when he was here on Earth
[1:07:36] Jesus Christ you remember the pro the
[1:07:38] Pharisees you know
[1:07:40] question and when his delivering Prophet
[1:07:42] came Moses down in Egypt what you to
[1:07:47] bring out their children of Egypt to put
[1:07:48] them in the promised
[1:07:50] land and that just hit me
[1:07:56] well there was no way for the children
[1:07:59] of Israel to enter the promised land
[1:08:01] without the grace of marriage and
[1:08:09] divorce would no
[1:08:15] way you don't understand them you
[1:08:17] following what heus saying when his
[1:08:19] delivering Prophet came forth Moses down
[1:08:21] in Egypt to bring the children out of
[1:08:23] Egypt that's what he come for to put
[1:08:25] them in the promised land and Jesus says
[1:08:27] here that Moses seen the people in this
[1:08:29] condition and he granted them a writing
[1:08:31] of
[1:08:33] divorcement because the situation was
[1:08:35] what it was Moses found such to let him
[1:08:37] suffer God permitted Moses that Prophet
[1:08:40] sent to the people to Grant this writing
[1:08:42] of divorcement to
[1:08:44] them they couldn't go to the promised
[1:08:47] land without
[1:08:51] that all right when Paul came forth with
[1:08:57] his I say unto
[1:09:00] thee the people were trying to receive
[1:09:02] the new
[1:09:04] birth and maybe they had
[1:09:07] it right but see he was beginning to
[1:09:11] speak of
[1:09:14] something a promised
[1:09:17] land and he knew that the people needed
[1:09:22] to be set free
[1:09:24] cuz what did they have back there in the
[1:09:26] Corinthians remember that was coming
[1:09:28] over and all and you remember then
[1:09:30] you're not just getting to Pentecost you
[1:09:32] don't go to Pentecost and cut off
[1:09:34] polygamy Israel went right on with their
[1:09:36] polygamy they do it today if they wanted
[1:09:38] to that's their business
[1:09:42] but like I've gave you the illustration
[1:09:44] What about Paul he winds up and the guy
[1:09:46] comes up and he says I want to accept
[1:09:48] Jesus
[1:09:50] Christ but I've been married I got all
[1:09:52] these wives what I do
[1:09:57] well they couldn't use it in the typ of
[1:09:58] Christ so something had to be
[1:09:59] straightened out so Paul said all right
[1:10:03] I
[1:10:06] say I
[1:10:08] say now back to a
[1:10:11] point that I was trying to
[1:10:13] make Grace is not for the future it's
[1:10:16] for the
[1:10:18] past how can you bring Rahab to harlot
[1:10:21] into the correct order of understanding
[1:10:24] you ever thought about
[1:10:30] that honest
[1:10:33] opinion I'd like to hear
[1:10:37] yours I believe Rahab the Harlot and
[1:10:39] that Israeli General went off and got
[1:10:44] married neither one of them was much
[1:10:46] concerned about
[1:10:51] Grace but then
[1:10:54] when it come time to go to the promised
[1:10:59] land in
[1:11:01] speaking see then they would not have an
[1:11:04] opportunity maybe to go to
[1:11:06] Moses because probably he was gone at
[1:11:09] that time I'm not so set on dates and
[1:11:12] times I'm just on a
[1:11:14] point see then when they
[1:11:18] did they could say Joshua what are we
[1:11:21] going to
[1:11:22] do
[1:11:25] now remember
[1:11:28] Joshua is greater in type than
[1:11:33] Moses
[1:11:36] right because he means Jehovah
[1:11:39] savior you know what he could tell him
[1:11:41] he said well let's just turn back here
[1:11:42] and read what Moses
[1:11:46] said and said Moses says go on As You
[1:11:52] Are go there's no need of separating
[1:11:56] doing this and breaking up brother R
[1:11:59] made it plain on marriage and divorce he
[1:12:00] said we don't have time for all these
[1:12:05] things and to me I'm honest I I believe
[1:12:08] he would have had to take taken every
[1:12:10] case
[1:12:12] individually and that's the reason he
[1:12:14] didn't have time to straighten it out
[1:12:16] because it would have took every case
[1:12:17] individually and there was no way in the
[1:12:19] world but my point is one
[1:12:22] thing before Moses could take them into
[1:12:25] the promised
[1:12:27] land he had to give them a
[1:12:32] grace before Paul could
[1:12:35] in speaking of Salvation he would give a
[1:12:41] Grace now I
[1:12:44] believe in the grace of marriage and
[1:12:46] divorce and I believe MOS when when
[1:12:48] brother brandham gave that
[1:12:50] Grace to those that were really true
[1:12:55] people
[1:12:57] right I believe God counted it as
[1:13:03] righteousness right and he could say you
[1:13:07] know go home with your
[1:13:10] wife I know the quote above there where
[1:13:12] he said wives I I read
[1:13:15] too but he said go on with your wife
[1:13:19] and raise those children in the
[1:13:22] admonition of the Lord
[1:13:23] but said don't do it
[1:13:26] again cuz see you're using up your
[1:13:31] grace you
[1:13:33] know and see people will say to you well
[1:13:36] brother Dale do you think I'm
[1:13:39] free you know am I free to get
[1:13:42] married I said you got to solve that
[1:13:44] between you and the
[1:13:46] Lord cuz that's every individual
[1:13:50] case you say yeah but so and so and so
[1:13:53] and so and so and so well so and so and
[1:13:55] so and so can lead to a lot of so and
[1:13:58] so
[1:13:59] right and we can maneuver ourselves
[1:14:03] through those things to try to work out
[1:14:06] our
[1:14:07] situations when why would we want
[1:14:14] to why would we not want to just say
[1:14:17] well
[1:14:18] okay Moses gave it Paul gave
[1:14:22] it and then brother brandham gave
[1:14:25] it but now here's my
[1:14:28] point Moses gave a
[1:14:32] natural
[1:14:35] right it was natural in the days of
[1:14:38] Moses but the time Paul comes into
[1:14:41] position where he's at is going from
[1:14:44] natural to
[1:14:51] spiritual right right
[1:14:54] have you ever noticed brother brandom in
[1:14:56] speaking of denominationalism and how we
[1:14:58] were all married to it but he makes an
[1:15:01] outstanding statement one day and he
[1:15:06] says God let it
[1:15:09] die I believe it's invisible
[1:15:11] union he said God let it
[1:15:15] die you can't kill
[1:15:18] it God let it
[1:15:20] die Paul's coming from a natural
[1:15:26] that he has to give the natural but he's
[1:15:29] heading into the spiritual to see what's
[1:15:31] going to take place well I believe
[1:15:32] brother ROM gave natural and
[1:15:34] spiritual that's me now there was
[1:15:37] natural things that he could speak
[1:15:40] of but remember we were every one of us
[1:15:44] whether we like it or not whether we
[1:15:47] were ever joined a church or not whether
[1:15:50] we ever went in a church or not we're
[1:15:52] all
[1:15:53] born
[1:15:55] organizational right you may not need
[1:15:59] the grace of marriage and divorce
[1:16:03] physically but if that old husband can't
[1:16:08] die what have we got
[1:16:14] spiritually brother Mo used to preach
[1:16:16] and enjoyed it he said are we married to
[1:16:18] Adam or
[1:16:19] Christ right you know that was his St
[1:16:23] statement I remember that message 40
[1:16:24] years
[1:16:25] ago are we married to Adam or Christ see
[1:16:29] every one of us was born to
[1:16:33] Adam by our sinful natures and
[1:16:37] ways all right and being doing that made
[1:16:40] us all married to organize religion once
[1:16:42] it come into being because that just
[1:16:44] spoke
[1:16:46] of what would come
[1:16:49] forth yeah my brother Dale I never did
[1:16:51] have none of them doctrines
[1:16:54] no we was born that
[1:16:58] way if you never had any of the
[1:17:01] doctrines you don't need the new
[1:17:10] birth but you see before God would allow
[1:17:14] Moses to take them into the you know
[1:17:16] over and cross into Canaan which we know
[1:17:18] Joshua had to do
[1:17:21] it he had to bring bring of
[1:17:26] Grace and see I believe the reason that
[1:17:28] we've been here 40 something years since
[1:17:30] the prophet has gone is because that we
[1:17:33] haven't received what we need
[1:17:38] right first off we won't admit we need
[1:17:42] it number one biggest
[1:17:44] problem
[1:17:47] sir you can say well I'm as little clean
[1:17:50] as can be you know
[1:17:53] well and
[1:17:57] good but what about the organizational
[1:18:00] isms that's bound us
[1:18:04] all if God don't let that die then where
[1:18:07] we at you see what's holding off the
[1:18:11] Rapture God has provided everything that
[1:18:13] we have need of he give us the baptism
[1:18:15] of the Holy Ghost he give us the
[1:18:16] prophet's message and he's given us
[1:18:18] plenty of time to study it
[1:18:21] out
[1:18:25] but what if that old husband's still
[1:18:29] alive I like what brother the old
[1:18:32] brother said one time he had a book
[1:18:34] marriage and divorce he wrote down on
[1:18:35] there he said I'd like to ask brother
[1:18:37] brandom these
[1:18:39] questions he said one day said a voice
[1:18:41] spoke to him and said are you going to
[1:18:43] believe what you wrote on that paper are
[1:18:45] you going to believe my Prophet you know
[1:18:47] what I believe God spoke to me I
[1:18:51] do
[1:18:53] yep because he put it right back in the
[1:18:55] word brother Brandon wasn't out of the
[1:18:58] word but what I love is this see Paul
[1:19:01] comes along in
[1:19:03] Corinthians met the same thing in the
[1:19:05] church and spoke this is I not the Lord
[1:19:08] that right now we didn't even know that
[1:19:10] existed until the prophet came
[1:19:14] right we didn't know Moses gave a Grace
[1:19:18] until the prophet
[1:19:19] came we didn't know that Paul gave a
[1:19:22] Grace until the Prophet came right watch
[1:19:26] it wasn't so from the beginning but
[1:19:29] Moses was permitted it and watch and God
[1:19:31] recognized it
[1:19:34] righteousness now we're back to where we
[1:19:36] were a while ago uh did everybody that
[1:19:40] claim to believe in the
[1:19:42] grace get the
[1:19:47] grace don't believe
[1:19:51] so because God couldn't count at
[1:19:59] righteousness are you with
[1:20:02] me did everybody that laid the lamb down
[1:20:05] get forgiven
[1:20:09] no only for a special
[1:20:14] people a group of people that could
[1:20:16] believe
[1:20:17] it and accept
[1:20:20] it well then what about coming on down
[1:20:22] to our
[1:20:25] Paul had a right when he found his
[1:20:26] church in that condition watching now
[1:20:29] you believe this to be true and believe
[1:20:31] it to come from God and by the
[1:20:34] Vindication of his cloud and his message
[1:20:36] that's brought me this far should not
[1:20:40] God upon the mountain permit me to do
[1:20:42] the same
[1:20:44] thing to suffer you to go on the way you
[1:20:47] are and do it no more go with your wives
[1:20:50] and live in peace for the hours late the
[1:20:53] coming of the Lord is at hand we haven't
[1:20:55] got time to break these things up don't
[1:20:58] you D try to do it again I'm speaking
[1:21:01] only to my congregation but if you are
[1:21:03] married and God bore me witness of that
[1:21:06] on the mountain that I could say this a
[1:21:10] supernatural
[1:21:14] Revelation because of the opening of The
[1:21:17] Seven
[1:21:19] Seals and this is a question in God's
[1:21:22] word now where is there a question in
[1:21:24] God's
[1:21:27] word now God was
[1:21:30] questioned right the Pharisees question
[1:21:34] it but where's their questioning God's
[1:21:43] word you get in a different
[1:21:45] category let them go on in as they are
[1:21:48] and sin no more it wasn't so from the
[1:21:51] beginning that's right
[1:21:53] it wasn't so and will not be at the end
[1:21:56] but under modern
[1:21:58] conditions he said I call myself a
[1:22:00] prophet if you remember the life
[1:22:01] statement made on marriage and divorce
[1:22:03] is an outstanding one and the word of
[1:22:05] the Lord came to the prophet that is the
[1:22:08] life statement that he made on marriage
[1:22:10] and
[1:22:12] divorce but do we believe that that's
[1:22:15] just for
[1:22:19] everybody
[1:22:21] no
[1:22:23] see Paul Paul spoke of it but do you
[1:22:26] think that Luther Wesley and him could
[1:22:28] understand those things
[1:22:32] no but see to a people that the word has
[1:22:37] unfolded it can be
[1:22:40] revealed but it will not take us into
[1:22:42] the wrong
[1:22:47] thing
[1:22:50] right do you believe in grace yes we
[1:22:53] don't believe in disgrace that's right I
[1:22:56] believe Grace is the word of God
[1:23:00] revealed you remember the statement I
[1:23:02] was looking while ago and couldn't find
[1:23:03] it exactly on wordy but somebody said to
[1:23:06] brother brandham later on about marriage
[1:23:08] and divorce he said you forgave their
[1:23:11] sins he said something to this degree it
[1:23:13] was the
[1:23:16] word the word is what forgives sins
[1:23:20] that's why Jesus said it because it's in
[1:23:21] the scriptures said the son of man hath
[1:23:23] power on Earth to forgive
[1:23:29] sins why because he was almighty
[1:23:33] God all
[1:23:35] right you said well the bride has the
[1:23:37] power to F he said yes if you come
[1:23:39] according to the
[1:23:43] word see the bride's got the power to
[1:23:46] forgive sins he just comes according to
[1:23:47] the
[1:23:48] word that's your
[1:23:51] Prophet but it's it's not to just set
[1:23:53] anybody free that you want to set
[1:23:55] free
[1:23:58] no but you take them back to the word
[1:24:01] that's right you come to me and you say
[1:24:03] well brother D what do you think about
[1:24:04] me it's not what I
[1:24:06] think it ain't got nothing to do with
[1:24:09] it is what God shows
[1:24:12] you and you tell me well God reveal to
[1:24:15] me I'm a't going to argue with
[1:24:17] you but I will ask you is it according
[1:24:21] to the scriptures
[1:24:23] if not then I'll just walk away from you
[1:24:27] saying that's
[1:24:30] yours I believe in
[1:24:32] grace but I believe the biggest Grace
[1:24:34] that we need to to have is the
[1:24:38] grace to realize that that old husband
[1:24:41] is
[1:24:42] dead that old denominational teaching
[1:24:45] why did he say we were in the problem of
[1:24:47] marriage and divorce because of
[1:24:49] misinterpreted
[1:24:51] theology
[1:24:57] and why can't we accept it and say well
[1:24:58] whatever God wants me to do then I'll
[1:25:00] just tell you that that's no problem but
[1:25:03] no we spend our time trying to figure it
[1:25:06] out and try to
[1:25:08] justify our
[1:25:13] doings like I told him last night about
[1:25:15] the man that claimed his wife was
[1:25:17] baptized by the Lord Jesus in the
[1:25:18] hospital because he come in she was wet
[1:25:21] all over you know poured water come in
[1:25:22] baptized her and the man said himself he
[1:25:25] said uh said he didn't know where she
[1:25:28] was going to live or not so he baptized
[1:25:29] her you know words he didn't have time
[1:25:31] to take her out and you know you know so
[1:25:35] you know it's starting off wrong uh you
[1:25:37] know and God didn't know where she going
[1:25:39] to live or not but
[1:25:42] anyhow so I I knew there's something
[1:25:44] wrong with the situation so I asked him
[1:25:46] a simple question I said you believe
[1:25:48] your wife was baptized there in the
[1:25:49] hospital bed you remember you know
[1:25:53] and uh he said yep I said well let me
[1:25:56] just turn this thing around let me come
[1:25:59] and tell you the
[1:26:01] story that my wife was in the
[1:26:05] hospital and my wife said Jesus come in
[1:26:08] and baptize
[1:26:11] her I said would you believe my wife was
[1:26:14] telling the
[1:26:16] truth he said
[1:26:21] no
[1:26:22] I just said so
[1:26:25] long why because his boss had spoke yeah
[1:26:30] his
[1:26:31] wife
[1:26:33] see he said if it's your wife I wouldn't
[1:26:36] believe it but my
[1:26:39] wife in other words he wasn't going to
[1:26:41] say a word to her cuz he's afraid of her
[1:26:45] but you
[1:26:46] know listen
[1:26:49] folks the grace of marriage and divorce
[1:26:51] is not a sloppy
[1:26:53] thing it's a very serious
[1:27:00] matter and should be prayed a lot about
[1:27:04] and thought you know and studied a lot
[1:27:06] about but not to try to find out what
[1:27:09] brother so and so said about
[1:27:11] it cuz he going to tell you what he
[1:27:14] believe but to find out what God
[1:27:19] Said and then remember God can't speak
[1:27:21] according to his against his word that's
[1:27:25] right what is the worst sin of all is
[1:27:27] misinterpreting God's word
[1:27:31] right brother Dale do you think that
[1:27:33] there's a Grace for people I
[1:27:37] do I
[1:27:39] do I think God can set things free I
[1:27:44] do but let's don't make it this some
[1:27:46] halfhazard
[1:27:50] thing and then my point
[1:27:53] is why would we not be happy where we're
[1:28:03] at instead of trying to figure out some
[1:28:06] way to get
[1:28:09] by you know
[1:28:14] what you know
[1:28:18] why I told my wife when we got married
[1:28:21] she knows it many many years years ago I
[1:28:23] said if I ever die I want you to
[1:28:26] marry but I said I will never marry
[1:28:31] again I said because I found my
[1:28:35] wife why would I want to look for
[1:28:37] another hi to put with that
[1:28:42] hi you
[1:28:44] know let me just be happy with what I
[1:28:49] am and as far as preaching you'd say
[1:28:52] well brother Dale would you sit down if
[1:28:54] somebody proved to you that your marital
[1:28:56] problem made you where you couldn't do
[1:28:58] it well exactly I'd want to said I
[1:29:05] am and would in Daron in no way to go
[1:29:07] along trying to prove it's okay for me
[1:29:09] to Mar I to preach or something I
[1:29:11] wouldn't do
[1:29:13] that I would just sit
[1:29:15] down I could quote his name and and all
[1:29:19] but anyhow he he was with brother
[1:29:20] brandham and when he he heard about what
[1:29:22] brother Brown said he used to preach but
[1:29:26] he
[1:29:31] quit why because brother Brown said that
[1:29:35] that wasn't right the way it was his
[1:29:36] wife had been married before and he just
[1:29:40] quit well well I can't quit I'm
[1:29:48] called brother Bram says if I never
[1:29:50] preach another sermon yes I sit down on
[1:29:53] a creek bank and enjoy life he said I'm
[1:30:01] saved but you know what he preached for
[1:30:03] you and me amen and I'm glad he
[1:30:07] did he gave his life for you and me and
[1:30:10] I'm glad he
[1:30:13] did at least let me honor it let's stand
[1:30:16] we'll go into the
[1:30:20] communion
[1:30:26] I know what this morning in trying to do
[1:30:28] but I hope you understood the whole
[1:30:31] thing together of what I was trying to
[1:30:33] bring out of the grace of marriage and
[1:30:35] divorce and and bringing it to the basis
[1:30:37] of you know to speak on
[1:30:41] Grace Grace now I hope you understand
[1:30:45] this wording to me Grace is a
[1:30:49] person it is the person of Jesus Jesus
[1:30:54] Christ why would I want to go any
[1:30:56] further than to be what he wants me to
[1:31:00] be and believe
[1:31:05] it Paul says for I have received with
[1:31:07] the Lord that which also I delivered
[1:31:09] unto you and to Lord Jesus the same
[1:31:12] night
