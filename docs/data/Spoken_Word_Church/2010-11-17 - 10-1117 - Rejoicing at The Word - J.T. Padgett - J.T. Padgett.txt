exactly what I need when I need and how to bring it about praise God Amen if you got your Bibles tonight we want to detain you to long but if you'd like to open them up to Psalms 119 and we're going to just look right there tonight for a little Foundation we'll start with tonight and just trust that something could be said tonight that will maybe be edifying or uplifting or help you some way as we walk in life amen there's uh uh I was just thinking the other day we was uh somewhere in a service and I got to my mind just kind of got to think about that uh you know it's so easy today to find fault or criticism or get uh you know bitter taste about things the way things are going and do you know and and and even as a Christian you know we have problem we have to watch out for that because we get bitterness in our heart because the way things are going but you know I read in the word where said all things work together for good to them that love God Amen all things work together praise the Lord so amen when I think about that then it changes everything else praise God but David was writing to us and Psalms 119 and verse 162 and we just kind of like to look at this little thought tonight David said I Rejoice at Thy word I Rejoice at Thy word you know there's so many things today we could think about that people love to get excited about but David found something that's Eternal of Eternal value he felt something that would be there when everything else was gone he found something that could stand in a position where all of his friends could forsake Him but there's always this would always be there that is the word of God Amen brothers and sisters and David said I Rejoice at Thy word as one that findeth great spoil Heavenly Father tonight dear God as we come to your throne of grace and mercy Lord it so good to see all these fine people here tonight Lord you're part of the Body of Christ upon the Earth your elect lady tonight oh God Heavenly Father the one that you paid the price for the one that you come to redeem the one whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life from the foundation of the world Lord the one dear God that you've come to Quicken that seed germ of life into their hearts oh God so tonight dear heavenly father just help us oh Lord to lay aside all the things that we've had the cares of today Lord and maybe the things that we'll have to do tomorrow maybe Lord Jesus just let us enter into that Fellowship behind that Veil tonight dear God lord where that hidden Mana is at where that Shak Glory will come down lord over that Mercy Seat dear heavenly father strike life upon the word tonight dear God lord Jesus and let it Blossom and bring forth life tonight oh God and every one of us tonight Lord and those that are not able to be in the house of the Lord Brother Dale and them where they at oh god brother brother in them dear father and brother Richard in them oh God be with them tonight dear heavenly father we ask your blessings to be upon us tonight all we ask father we remember the sick and The Afflicted tonight God we got unsaved loved ones tonight father Lord Jesus that need the touch of the Holy Spirit to come oh God and touch their heart tonight Lord Of Your Grace father we ask all things tonight father in Jesus Christ's precious name amen and amen God bless as you're seated tonight man it's good to see everybody tonight praise the Lord and I just trust that you're feeling real good tonight and uh uh you know the Holy Spirit can just Quicken something to your heart right just I thought uh as we're thinking about this I found a little thing here a while back and uh I shared it with the church and he said Jesus of Nazareth without money and without arms conquered more Millions than Alexander the Great or Caesar or Mohammad or Napoleon without science and learning he shed more light on things human and divine than all the philosophers and the scholars combined without the eloquence of school he spoke such words of life as were never spoken before or S and produced effects which lie beyond the reach of an orator or a poet and with writing a single line he set more pens in motion and furnished more things for more sermons and orientations and discussions and learned volumes and works of art and songs of praise than the whole Army of Great Men of ancient and modern times what about that never even went 200 miles away from his birthplace and yet today Amen to God he's still changing hearts and lives Amen to God and saving Sinners and amen bringing people Amen to God that look like would never have been able Amen to rise up out of the gutters amen and never be able to rise up Amen in into a realm amen where they could be called Sons and Daughters of God still today he's saving praise the Lord and delivering Amen to God my still you go into a bookstore and there's just books on top of books amen people have tried to write all the different things about the Lord Jesus Christ amen we got got the Bible many sermons have been preached about it and still the volumes that we have will not cover it all yet praise God and the Bible says if all the books amen were written about the Lord the world couldn't contain all of them praise God one man Chang an entire globe of people praise God my bringing Deliverance Amen to the captives in distress amen Healing The Sick and The Afflicted praise the Lord God tonight amen somebody that could take a sinner Amen to God and wash him in his blood praise the Lord and bring a Perfection out of that imperfection praise the Lord I thank God for a god like that tonight I thank God tonight that God could reach down amen when I was on my road to the pits of Hell amen and transform my life and change me from what I was to what I am and what one day I will be praise the Lord God tonight amen so I get to thinking about the Lord and what all he is and no Wonder David could say I Rejoice at the word as one that findeth great spoil you know I think about David he wrote so many things about it he said in Psalms 119 verse 165 he said great peace have they which love thy law the law is a type of the word and nothing shall offend them in other words they'll have no stumbling block amen tonight to be able to open back the word of God Amen to a lot of people they open the word of God and they say well there's there's too many contrad I in the word so you have trouble uh to believe a book like this but you know what every time I open the word of God I've never found a contradiction in it yet praise Lord it depends on how you look at what you're looking at praise the Lord amen with what nine said amen to God somebody said well I find too many faults in it well I'm going to tell you what if you're looking for one you may find one but I've never found the fault yet praise the Lord as pilot said there's no fault in him praise the Lord oh my when people look at us they see all the imperfection but the thing they don't see is what's on the inside praise God what is on the inside what are we tabernacling tonight it's the word of God in our heart praise the Lord amen that can change us amen even change the way we think and the way we look at things am can bring us Amen to God from a place that looks like we' never be able to rise above where we're at ien but yet it would bring us up into a place the Bible say we can sit together in Heavenly places in the Lord Jesus Christ tonight in so much that we can even have the very mind of the Lord Jesus Christ now think like he thinks praise God talk like he talks and walk like he walks praise the Lord God oh my think about the word of God tonight amen there's power in the word amen to God depends on how you look at it though a lot of churches look at the word of God and they say oh you know the days of Miracles were P brother B kept talking about that amen the days of Miracles were P well to them they were P amen I thank God God never let me look at it that way but he let me look at it in another way there's still miracles in the word of God tonight I still believe it can open the blinded eyes tonight I believe it can unstop the death ears tonight I believe it can cause the lame to walk in the blind to see and the death to hear praise the Lord God he improved amen he can still raise from the dead tonight Hallelujah God thank God for that tonight amen to God brother man said he said M he the only one that can put life in the word amen you know if we just take the Bible itself without the Holy Spirit it just becomes a de L to us amen that's what happened to Israel they took the law amen without faith the Bible says in Hebrews chapter 2 they never mix Faith with the word amen to God and it become a dead letter to them and they try amen to off operate with god without faith you cannot operate with god without faith for the Bible say for without faith it is impossible to please God for by faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God not beside but by the word of God hallelujah to God Amen the things that we see tonight were framed by the word of God everything in this buing was framed by the word of God tonight oh my the very Earth we sit and walk upon was framed by the very word of God tonight Hallelujah to God and I said the god that could create the Earth and bring it and hang it in the just hanging out here in open space and for trillions of years she's been hanging there praise God oh that kind of God he's wanting to live in my heart tonight I say Lord open the doors of my heart and come in tonight praise God amen amen the god little song S I think brother dick sang it sometime to Open the Eyes of My Heart Amen brother I want him to open him up real wide brother praise God hallelujah so he can put life into the word tonight amen here I would it be my body he says standing here without a spirit I'd be dead oh It's Only Life can can Quicken this body to move and it's only the holy spirit that can Quicken the word and he is the only one can put it in action praise God oh my that's a really Amen brother I could go to school amen and you know what amen they would do the best they could but you know what they can't put life in the word I can sit under a minister and that Minister can talk about the word he can preach about the word oh he can tell me all the great things but he can't put life in it praise God but there is one who can put life in it tonight and bring life out of it praise God when it comes into our heart to God oh my thank you Lord Jesus tonight oh he said God I me through a seat of his word and there is only one thing that can Quicken the word and that is the spirit for it is the lifegiver to the word praise God oh and he said when the life in the word meets the life in the spirit it produces whatever the seed is praise God Hallelujah to God oh I like that amen he said and as long as you take God at his word and then the word will produce what it's promised to do no wonder David got excited about the word of God when the word fell into his heart he began to pull on that word oh you say well Brother Jay he did this and he did that sure he did a lot of things praise God but there's one thing about it it was something in David's heart that looked beyond all of those things because a lot of times we walk through life and we have our little hangups we have our little things that goes wrong and we begin to look at that and we say oh but could God use somebody like me I'm going tell you what ien God can use anybody that will turn their life around and say Lord here I am as Isaiah said Lord here I am Use Me Lord praise God speak to me Lord God is just looking for a vessel who will yield himself unto him tonight that's what God looking for tonight he just wants us to surrender all that we have unto him praise God that's right Amen to God taking God at his word oh you say now look he said now maybe oh he said maybe you don't believe that that you say well my faith is what you hear a lot of people say what brother I just have a hard time having faith you know what I find out Faith sometimes is coming a mysterious thing because there's times if you ever get your mind off of whatever it is that you're trying to have faith for then you'll get healed because as long as you're looking at the situation it's hard to have faith most every time that God has ever healed my body it's when I got my mind off of it wasn't thinking about it and a lot of times it was in times I wouldn't even think about being there come on yeah because as long as I had the problem going on my mind it was hard to have faith but if I could just get it off my mind get off over here and begin to do something else ien to forget about what it was and next thing you wow what happened to it that's right that's what God likes to he likes to take those situations that we can just get our mind away from it and let him begin to work he said now look he said you say well my faith is weak I wouldn't confess it see don't let the devil know that always say I've got good faith now don't say you've got all faith brother say if you say you got all faith and Comm make you to be prayed for he said there's something wrong because he said if you got all Faith you won't be up here right but say you got good faith nothing wrong with that I've got good faith Brother Jay Hallelujah to God oh my Lord just open up the winter my heart tonight Lord and let be able to absorb that word tonight like that that I've got good faith tonight I believe God with all my heart see don't testify to anything of the devil tonight right no because you know what he wants you to keep your eye on that problem and you know what the more you keep your eye on the problem the bigger the problem get but if you ever get Your Eyes On Christ and and begin to think about Christ then he gets bigger then the problem gets smaller praise God until it's go on HJ to God tonight amen amen praise the Lord rejoicing at the word now listen what David said Psalms 119 verse 130 I like I like these little scriptures maybe it just be a a little a stimula that you want get a little stimulation amen David said the entrance or the opening or the unfolding of thy words and I thought my goodness right that's it think about today now I'm just thinking about brother dick coming over here tonight how much knowledge that God has poured out in this age alone stop think about it just for a minute just just let your minds go and if you've had a lot of things going on today just you know just kind of block it out and just start and F God has opened back so much knowledge out of this word that no other age you young people listen to me cuz I come up in the Pentecostal mov and I know what it was back there when we run the aisles and turn the benches over hello climb the poles people do oh yeah oh yeah sister Pastor sister maybe she want my her sister we was in the Pentecostal Jesus name church one time and we just hadn't heard nothing about really at this time and they had one of them my little youve heard brother B talk about little pot belly stoves over there and that thing was red hot the pipe was hot she went over and grabbed that thing brother and Dan to jig around that dude but brother she' never come to this message yet hello so I know what it was back there we saw God moving anointed amen those were manifest trying to get them to come to the word when the word was preached then they back away from the word we praying for praying for all her family praise God and one day they'll come on and receive the word of the Lord but see what it was am me they had they had all of the manifestation but when the word come come on Amen they had a hang up not just them a lot of people had a a lot of my family had it they still got it mm oh yeah they like to see us if we get rid of this yeah you know cuz we could conform more back to what they think or to be religious I guess you call it but see we're walking in the light and I begin to think about what all God has done in this hour that we're at you takeing brother brother Ernie was just sharing a couple little things over the other day my mind just kept going justification by faith now Luther taught justification by faith I've got his books probably not all of them well Ain got several of them and I read what he talked about justification by the problem is with Luther he couldn't see how you could be justified by faith amen and turn around and be predestinated to do something justification and and and predestination and those things were there there was a lot of conflict in that to their thinking praise God and I thought here we are we can believe predestination we can believe the for knowledge of God we can believe in justification sanctification full restoration of the word no problem they had troubles back there trying to believe you go back and you read a lot of the older brothers that come on like Alexander Campbell and on back and on back through there and and John Knox and all of those they were great men preach great things but to see what we you see right brother right we have had a a such a such an old into the very Mind Of God we can realize today that we were actually with God in God as a very thought in his thinking they couldn't see that oh my God we just kind of hitting and missing look like a lot of but we find out that we were with God in God as a very thought and attribute of God that God could bring and bring down here to the earth oh my oh I begin to think about that my goodness gracious am what if I had have saved back after there pente cost running oh we oh yeah brother we have been running and running and running and run we've been like children we've been still running around that M now that's right Hallelujah shouting and turning to Banes over right praise God many a time I'm going to go to church and and you know what amen they would get so excited brother the preacher didn't even have time to preach because they had to sing and shout right whoa what was wrong they couldn't see what the word was that's right then the word comes along and says brother that he has been search and resarch on your behalf Plumb back into the very eternity in the mind of God that there is nothing no condemnation against you right where was I at I was in the mind of God in the perfected mind of God and now here I am in this world and looks like Satan is just going to take me wash me out but you know what God come along just in time he's on time all the time every time praise God and it begin to open up to our mind my you were with me before the foundation of the world and all of a sudden you open up the word of God there in Revelation 138 our names were already written in the Lamb's Book of life but before the foundation of the world Amen Satan come and said I'll wipe you out I said you can't wipe me out if you wipe me out you got to wipe God out you can't wipe God out and so he cannot take a Believer out praise God Amen but El likea T in her mind with it what you done well is what he done I didn't do what he did uhuh I done a lot of dumb thing but I should would done what he done praise God oh David said the entrance or the opening or the unfolding of the word I I begin to think about here God comes and opens up four horse riders opening of the seven seal Redemption full restoration and all the great truths of God's word and letting us see where the great heart it was at what her work was where her conniving was going on and how that that religious spirit would be upon the Earth so strong it would deceive the very elect if it were possible Right but the word of God I believe it's not possible for an elect to be deceived praise God hallelujah oh I like to put that in the devil's ear amen and scream an interest on unfolding of that word it give us life or Enlighten of the eyes Amen to God remember when uh Saul made a proclamation one time he was going to battle and he told him to not eat anything and so Jonathan he didn't hear the report and so Jonathan and his buddy was out there and they found some honey and they you how you are when you're just about feel like you're about ready to p out or fall over and old Jonathan reached down there and got him a big big oh my and all of a sudden my energy instant energy his eyes oh he said it had enlightened me and his eyes flew open with new strength and new energy praise God that's the way the word of God is tonight it's a taste of the honey from Heaven praise God and we take a little of that it opens up our to let us see amen that God had foreordained us before the foundation of the world to go and be with him Hallelujah to God Amen to God oh my no wonder that we got excited about the word of God Amen thank you Jesus for the Holy Ghost Amen to God David said in Psalm 119 verse 50 this is my comfort and my Affliction for Thy Word word have quickened or life given or given life to me it's amazing what the word can do to a person that's right amen amen that word comes that zoy that eternal life comes into

you know we just we're just here and oh shamgar but God had something different in mind about shamgar shamgar and the Book of Judges over we just kind of one about one little verse of scripture and the Bible says in uh judges 3:31 and after him was shamgar amen the word shamgar means a sword Amen to God he was the warrior and didn't know it right the son of anah which slew of the Philistines 600 men with an Osco and he also delivered Israel this then said he said here I uh here he heard something coming up the road here come amen oh my about 600 Philistines armed and ready see the thing about

even all the vessels everything had to be sprinkled with the blood of a bull or a goat right it could only put our sins forward but could not justify us right hello he could put them forward but
