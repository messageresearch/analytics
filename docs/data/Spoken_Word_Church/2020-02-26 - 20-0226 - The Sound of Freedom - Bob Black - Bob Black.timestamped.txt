[0:02] yeah I'll just pray for me a little bit
[0:04] I'm still a bit stopped up from listen
[0:12] let's go ahead and turn over the eggs
[0:13] for this chapter and this is Lois
[0:19] familiar scripture to us I know and then
[0:27] we're also going a little bit ACCA's
[0:28] chapter 25 let's just give it a look
[0:33] well God we're so grateful to you to be
[0:36] able to gather around your word once
[0:37] more or than we pray Lord that we would
[0:40] come expecting Lord that tonight will
[0:42] not be in vain Lord that you'll come and
[0:44] liver us and heal us and Lord deliver us
[0:48] from the many things that afflict us
[0:49] Lord Jesus deliver us from ourselves
[0:51] Lord and I pray God it tonight you'll
[0:54] give your people a little bit of
[0:55] something extra Lord Jesus that might
[0:57] carry the bone or Jesus that will give
[0:59] them shrimp in order to give us all Lord
[1:02] something Lord Lord in this middle of
[1:04] the week now we're gonna pray Lord at
[1:06] you as we open up the doors of our heart
[1:08] Lord Jesus are ready to receive our God
[1:10] I pray Lord that you'll feel invited
[1:12] Lord God and come among us Lord Jesus we
[1:15] ask these things in your name amen
[1:20] Exodus chapter 21 verses 1 to 7 and it
[1:24] says now these are the judgments which
[1:25] thou shall set before them we come out
[1:29] of come out of Egypt and now God is kind
[1:31] of setting some things in order about
[1:33] how they should their Israelites are
[1:35] supposed to behave if they'll buy and
[1:37] the Hebrew servant six years he shall
[1:39] serve and in the seventh he shall go out
[1:41] free for nothing and I've got that
[1:44] colored so you can see with the most and
[1:47] that kind of the critical poise
[1:49] if he came in by himself he shall go out
[1:52] by himself if he were married than his
[1:54] wife so go out with him if his master
[1:56] have given him a wife and she have borne
[1:58] him sons or daughters the wife and her
[2:00] children shall be her masters and he
[2:02] shall go out by himself and if the
[2:05] servant shall plainly say I love my
[2:07] master my wife and my children I will
[2:09] go out free then his master shall bring
[2:12] him under the judges he shall also bring
[2:14] him to the door or under under the
[2:16] doorpost and his master shall board his
[2:19] ear through with an awl and he shall
[2:23] serve him forever then let's go over the
[2:25] Leviticus chapter 25 verses 8 to 10 and
[2:29] it says and thou shalt number seven
[2:33] Sabbath's of years under these seven
[2:35] times seven years and the space of the
[2:37] seven Sabbath's of years shall be under
[2:40] the forty and nine years it then shout
[2:42] they'll cause the trumpet of the jubilee
[2:44] to sound on the tenth day of the seventh
[2:46] month and the day of atonement shall you
[2:48] make the trumpet sound throughout all
[2:49] your land and ye shall hallow the
[2:51] fiftieth year and proclaim Liberty
[2:53] throughout all the land and to all the
[2:55] inhabitants thereof it shall be a
[2:57] jubilee unto you and ye shall return
[3:00] every man unto his possession and ye
[3:03] shall return every man unto his family
[3:05] you may be seated in the presence of the
[3:08] Lord now you know sometimes when you
[3:14] come into the house the Lord
[3:16] the minister preached something real
[3:18] scalding and real hurtful and things and
[3:21] things to kind of mold you and
[3:22] everything but deny I believe I want to
[3:25] take for a topic the sound of freedom
[3:27] because I believe that that the message
[3:31] tonight will look I want to build
[3:34] everybody up and cause you to realize
[3:37] maybe the day in the hour that we're
[3:38] living in and calls you to realize that
[3:40] there's something that God has given to
[3:41] us to cause us to escape the bondage of
[3:44] this world and to escape the bondage of
[3:46] living in sin the bondage of corruption
[3:48] the bondage of having a corrupt mind and
[3:52] you know uh this the first Scripture we
[3:55] read in Exodus chapter 21 was it was it
[3:58] was written to a people that had just
[4:00] come out of Egypt they had been down in
[4:02] bondage for forty years they come out in
[4:04] it they had lived through some things
[4:06] and they had lived through people
[4:08] cracking whips and telling them which
[4:10] way they should go and what they should
[4:12] do and causing them just to rise up in a
[4:15] particular hour and go to bed at a
[4:16] particular hour and just having total
[4:18] control over their life
[4:19] and you know you look around today and
[4:21] maybe guys on the streets as you go to
[4:23] work and all in your car and you look
[4:25] around at people honking at one another
[4:26] and people are living in bondage without
[4:29] realizing that they're in bondage the
[4:31] Egyptians knew that they were in bondage
[4:33] but so many people don't realize today
[4:35] that they are in bondage because the
[4:37] devil has pulled the wool over their
[4:39] eyes it calls them to not realize the
[4:41] state that they're in but maybe tonight
[4:44] many of you here sitting tonight could
[4:46] be in bondage could be in a state of
[4:47] bondage could be could be crippled and
[4:50] and not realizing what your life is for
[4:53] what you're doing here what what your
[4:55] what what the whole plan and purpose of
[4:57] just living is and and you know what
[5:00] that puts you in a state of bondage but
[5:02] there is a there is a deliverance from
[5:05] that I wanted to clear to you tonight
[5:06] that God has made a way for you to be
[5:09] delivered so that's when I when I speak
[5:11] on the sound of freedom I believe that
[5:13] there is a sound that can go out to
[5:15] declare your freedom but then when you
[5:17] receive that freedom then you become the
[5:20] living embodiment of that sound you
[5:22] become the voice of that sound and
[5:24] that's what I want to declare tonight
[5:27] brother Branham said in all the days of
[5:29] our life go ahead and pull that cord up
[5:33] I'm gonna try not to get leaky tonight
[5:35] because I'm just - I'm still on the man
[5:40] say y'all pray for me and brother
[5:43] branham said that all the days of our
[5:44] life he said now we hear so much today
[5:46] about we are free oh we live in a
[5:49] beautiful America we are free all the
[5:51] air is full of it books you're wrote of
[5:53] it thousands of them but you are a
[5:55] million miles for being free you're not
[5:58] free don't you be to see by that is
[6:00] America America is one of the greatest
[6:02] deceived nations and in more bondage
[6:05] than any place I know of you think about
[6:08] what a contradiction that is that in the
[6:10] place where they say that this is the
[6:12] most freedom resides the most the most
[6:15] amount of bondage the people that are
[6:17] most at most in bondage by watching
[6:20] television they can't hardly get away
[6:21] from the television they can't hardly
[6:23] get away from
[6:23] radio in the car they're so in so much
[6:25] bondage to the music that they listen to
[6:27] that they can't I can't help but a lot I
[6:29] just love music so much if they were you
[6:32] know I remember when I was in school
[6:33] you'd ask that the teacher would ask
[6:35] what was one thing that you could do
[6:37] couldn't do without I couldn't do
[6:39] without listen to the music I couldn't
[6:41] listen do without all this rock and roll
[6:43] because they're in bondage to that it's
[6:45] got a hold on their life and people
[6:48] think people think that they're that
[6:50] they're in Liberty because they're able
[6:52] to dress whatever way they want to and
[6:54] they were able to talk but they're able
[6:55] to curse and do all these different kind
[6:57] of things but they're in bondage to the
[6:59] devil listen listen living in sin and
[7:02] living in the world is not Liberty
[7:04] that's not freedom that's not being able
[7:05] to just do whatever you want because
[7:07] you're gonna be in servitude to one
[7:09] thing you're gonna have a master and
[7:10] it's gonna be either the devil or it's
[7:12] gonna be God it's gonna be either Christ
[7:15] there's gonna be Satan you're gonna be
[7:17] you're gonna have and I want to maybe
[7:19] share to you tonight the pleasure and
[7:20] the joy of being in servitude to God
[7:23] it's not it's not a grievous burden it's
[7:26] not something that we're burdens are
[7:27] heaped upon us but it's something
[7:29] delightful to be able to serve the
[7:30] Living God and let me finish reading
[7:34] this quote he said they're worse in
[7:35] bondage than communism could put them in
[7:38] communism can only hurt the body they
[7:40] could only put the body and bondage but
[7:43] when the devil comes in he puts the soul
[7:45] in bondage and man is a slave America is
[7:48] a bunch of slaves you may be a slave to
[7:51] pride you might walk up and down the
[7:53] streets and go through every store and
[7:55] every fashion that you can see on
[7:56] television and go from store to store
[7:59] trying to buy something you become a
[8:01] slave to it you become a slave to your
[8:03] dressing you become a slave to your
[8:05] money that's the only thing that you
[8:07] think of is to make money
[8:09] grab and put it up here if you do that
[8:11] you're a slave you're a slave to it it
[8:14] won't think we think so much we have
[8:16] such liberty to be able to post pictures
[8:18] on Instagram and Facebook on how pretty
[8:20] we are and how how nice we look at post
[8:23] pictures of our shoes and the food that
[8:25] we eat look at this great dessert that
[8:27] that this person has made for me and you
[8:29] can be living in slavery doing all of
[8:31] those
[8:32] wonderful things but still bound to
[8:34] trying to drum up your life and make it
[8:35] look something more delicious than it
[8:37] really is more wonderful make it look
[8:39] like on Facebook that you're living a
[8:41] perfect life with a perfect family went
[8:43] down down in your soul something is
[8:46] something that's cried out here you need
[8:48] something you need to be delivered from
[8:50] bondage the Israelites done in either
[8:54] they had to they had to make bricks
[8:56] without straw all they had to do do
[8:58] whatever that master said they had to
[9:00] arise when he said the taskmasters whip
[9:03] constantly on their back when the devil
[9:06] will tell you everything
[9:07] everyone is happy that you're in prison
[9:09] that even God doesn't love you anymore
[9:12] listen he'll make it he'll put you in
[9:14] prison and make that prison experience
[9:17] that bondage experience so miserable
[9:19] he'll build up a complex in you to make
[9:22] you look around the church maybe or
[9:23] though your family or the people that
[9:25] you associate with and make you think
[9:27] that everybody hates you because of some
[9:29] little little thing and they're you
[9:31] walking around just bound up in bondage
[9:38] you know you begin to think I can't
[9:40] break free of consuming things I
[9:42] shouldn't look to Jesus who already made
[9:45] a way you begin to think I can't break
[9:48] free of looking things of looking at
[9:50] things of consuming things that I
[9:52] shouldn't look at Jesus who already paid
[9:54] the price I can't break free of doubt
[9:56] and worry but look look if you can't
[9:58] break apart break free of all your doubt
[10:00] and worry look at the stripes that he
[10:02] bought for you for our sorrows and for
[10:04] our iniquities you say why why did it
[10:10] want his brother Bob every time it seems
[10:12] like every time he comes up and
[10:13] businesses preach he he begets this hit
[10:14] on these kind of things
[10:15] he don't hit on the things that people
[10:18] living in bondage or whatever I'm trying
[10:20] we're the reason people preach on these
[10:22] kind of things is because because we're
[10:24] trying to bring liberty to you we're not
[10:26] trying to push you down and beat on you
[10:28] but we're trying to bring you to a place
[10:30] where you realize what God has already
[10:32] done for you that he
[10:33] I already paid the price and it's
[10:35] something free do you realize how what a
[10:37] glorious thing the gospel is that you
[10:39] don't have to do one thing for it all
[10:41] you have to do is just open up your
[10:42] heart and believe God you don't you
[10:44] don't have to run a race you don't have
[10:46] to push a penny with your nose you don't
[10:47] have to go up steps on your knees you
[10:49] don't have to do anything all you have
[10:50] to do is receive it it's a free gift to
[10:52] you God can deliver you from the prison
[10:56] house you know what many times with the
[10:58] prison house in our mind is we go
[11:00] through life when we begin to wonder
[11:01] what is our purpose what am I even doing
[11:03] here and I know that's a something that
[11:06] many of the young people deal with in
[11:08] their minds what what am I supposed to
[11:10] do in my life how am I supposed to how
[11:12] am I supposed to provide for my family
[11:13] would it work Who am I gonna marry all
[11:15] these kind of things and you know
[11:17] without the gospel that question can
[11:19] never be answered the question of what
[11:21] is my purpose in life can never be
[11:23] answered without the gospel you can go
[11:25] through life and you've got a job and
[11:27] you'll fall asleep at the table and at
[11:29] night and you'll go to bed and you'll
[11:31] wake up with it and your whole life will
[11:33] just be empty and meaningless said one
[11:35] day you'll go and die and the grave and
[11:36] there'll be a great filled with your
[11:38] body and your whole life will be
[11:39] meaningless without the gospel the
[11:42] gospel is what gives your life meaning
[11:43] and purpose because it identifies what
[11:46] you are here for and what you're living
[11:48] for there is a purpose in your life
[11:50] because because I put it in Bible turns
[11:52] you have an inheritance God gave you an
[11:56] inheritance your inheritance was in him
[11:57] before the foundation of the world and
[11:59] your inheritance is the Word of God your
[12:02] purpose in life is to fulfill the Word
[12:04] of God to be a walking talking
[12:06] manifestation living breathing word of
[12:08] God on the earth to fulfill his words
[12:11] your purpose in life is to be delivered
[12:14] from the world to have a sound mind to
[12:17] know what your purpose and plan is the
[12:19] purpose and plan for your life is the
[12:21] your inheritance is to have healing in
[12:24] your body and peace in time of trouble
[12:26] your inheritance is your inheritance is
[12:29] to have comfort as you walk the valley
[12:31] of the shadow of death the only way that
[12:34] you could have those things that's
[12:35] through the gospel of Jesus Christ
[12:37] you know we sing that that song as the
[12:39] ministers comes out open the eyes of my
[12:41] heart but the eyes of your heart cannot
[12:43] be open to these promise
[12:45] to the inheritance of God if you don't
[12:47] open up the door of your heart and
[12:48] believe it and accept it and say but
[12:50] that is for me I believe it brother in
[12:54] 1st Peter chapter 1 verse 3 it says
[12:56] blessed be the God and father of our
[12:59] Lord Jesus Christ which according to his
[13:01] abundant mercy has to be gotten us unto
[13:04] a lively hope by the resurrection of
[13:06] Jesus Christ from the dead through it
[13:09] inheritance incorruptible and undefiled
[13:11] and faded that fadeth not away reserved
[13:15] in heaven for you that's your
[13:17] inheritance and eret an inheritance
[13:19] incorruptible and undefiled that fadeth
[13:22] not a way that will last forever and
[13:24] ever you have an inheritance and that
[13:27] inheritance is the word of God listen
[13:30] let sweet
[13:30] let's read in the Jubilee year what
[13:32] brother brems said he said today that
[13:35] men and women in our country so our
[13:39] brothers in the back y'all keep up with
[13:41] me as best you can today that men and
[13:45] women in our country and everywhere else
[13:47] has sold herself out to seeing drinking
[13:50] gambling carousing doing things that
[13:52] they ought not to do and become slaves
[13:55] to the devil I met a young lady here not
[14:00] long ago she said brother Branham I'd
[14:03] give anything if I could only break this
[14:05] band of whiskey she said I started when
[14:08] I was a little girl went with a boy that
[14:09] drink we started mixing drinks and I
[14:12] become a perfect slave to it and if I
[14:15] don't have it she says I just go wild if
[14:17] I could only get rid of this I said you
[14:19] can't no here's the key
[14:21] this is the thing that we battle with so
[14:23] many times we think well I'm going to do
[14:25] that I'm gonna save my kids I'm gonna
[14:26] have I can just say that you know word
[14:28] reason with my kids enough then they'll
[14:30] be saved if I can if I can just do it on
[14:33] my own accord I can break the bonds of
[14:35] this alcohol or this drug addiction or
[14:37] whatever it is I can do it on myself but
[14:40] listen what brother Branham said you
[14:42] can't do it yourself
[14:43] but I know someone who can break it for
[14:46] you the Lord Jesus Christ has come to
[14:49] make you free listen we know who can
[14:53] make us free we know how to do it but
[14:55] what you've got to do is you've got to
[14:57] yield yourself to him you've got to
[14:59] allow him to set you free if you don't
[15:01] allow him to set you free then you can't
[15:03] be free but he was scuse me let me I'm
[15:10] trying to quote a scripture that I don't
[15:12] have it in front of me let's keep
[15:14] reading 1st Corinthians chapter 6 verse
[15:17] 9 to 12 it says know you not that the
[15:19] unrighteous shall not inherit the
[15:20] kingdom of God be not deceived neither
[15:23] fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers
[15:25] nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves
[15:28] with mankind nor thieves nor covetous
[15:30] nor drunkards nor revilers nor
[15:33] extortioners shall inherit the kingdom
[15:35] of God and such were some of you but you
[15:38] are washed but you are sanctified but
[15:40] you are justified in the name of the
[15:42] Lord Jesus and by the spirit of God
[15:45] listen you Paul Paul's reading through
[15:47] all of this list of all of these things
[15:49] that that that identifies someone that
[15:53] has not heard that Jubilee sound that
[15:55] hurt not heard that that message of
[15:58] freedom and those people if they never
[16:02] hear the gospel of Jesus Christ who
[16:04] cannot inherit the kingdom of God in
[16:06] other words you cannot inherit the
[16:08] kingdom of God if you're in bondage you
[16:11] got to come out of the jailhouse you
[16:13] you've got to first realize that you're
[16:15] in bondage that there's something wrong
[16:17] with your life and I believe that that's
[16:20] what the preaching of the gospel is for
[16:21] to identify that there's something that
[16:23] you need there's something needful in
[16:25] your life that you need to come out of
[16:27] that situation
[16:28] Ephesians chapter 5 verses 3 through 5
[16:31] says but fornication and all uncleanness
[16:33] or covetousness let it not be once named
[16:36] among you as becometh the Saints neither
[16:39] filthiness nor foolish talking nor
[16:41] jesting which are not convenient but
[16:44] rather giving of things but he's leading
[16:45] all kind of things that maybe would put
[16:48] us under the umbrella of those things
[16:50] foolish talking and jesting just joking
[16:52] about being silly about gotten different
[16:55] kind of things which it's not convey
[16:57] but rather giving of thanks for this she
[16:59] know that no whoremonger nor unclean
[17:01] person nor covetous man who is an
[17:04] idolater has any inheritance in the
[17:07] kingdom of Christ and of God that kind
[17:10] of a person living at that kind of a
[17:11] life without without God on the inside
[17:13] to God their life there have they have
[17:16] no inheritance in other words they have
[17:19] no claim on the Word of God they don't
[17:21] know what their purpose is they don't
[17:22] know what they're doing here
[17:23] they have no inheritance no inheritance
[17:26] but but you I want to declare to you
[17:28] tonight that you have an inheritance
[17:30] under the sound of my voice I'm
[17:32] declaring to you that the Word of God is
[17:34] laying there waiting for you to receive
[17:36] it let me just go through these I think
[17:43] sometimes it's helpful maybe it's just
[17:44] kind of nail down some of these things
[17:46] and I just preach out a little bit Paul
[17:51] was talking about fornicators and
[17:53] adulterers and an unmarried person
[17:55] unmarried people and gays you and one
[17:58] another or married people engaging and
[18:00] doing things that they should not be
[18:01] able to not do idolaters a Dollar Tree
[18:04] is something you know do you know I'm
[18:06] dog 3 hits in places that you might not
[18:08] think of idolatry is to place anything
[18:12] before God and put that before God you
[18:15] can put your TV you can put some kind of
[18:17] game that you playing you can put
[18:18] anything anything that keeps you away
[18:20] from coming to church on Sunday anything
[18:23] in your life you put it you put it
[18:24] before God and becomes an idol to you
[18:26] because this if it's before God then
[18:29] that means you're working with that
[18:30] thing if you place that thing before God
[18:32] then you're placing that thing higher
[18:34] that God in your life and you are
[18:36] working with that thing that's what
[18:37] idolatry is why are we not in church on
[18:40] Sunday we value our own personal
[18:42] activities more than we value serving
[18:45] God we should give everything over to
[18:47] God we should place God before every we
[18:50] should place God before our spouse
[18:51] before our job before everything else
[18:54] because when you play something before
[18:56] God it becomes an IDOT an idol in your
[18:59] life
[19:01] effeminate abusers of themselves with
[19:04] mankind Steve so let me just take this
[19:06] I'm gonna just take this and run and try
[19:08] to take something that don't
[19:09] belong to you covered us a deep desire
[19:12] to possess what belongs to others I
[19:14] really like that car that brothers
[19:17] driving all these kind of things you see
[19:19] when the word of God comes and takes
[19:21] preeminence over a person's life it
[19:23] drives all of that selfish behavior out
[19:27] of you so that you you begin to value
[19:29] somebody else more than you value your
[19:32] own self yeah I was reading a quote that
[19:34] I will have in front of me but brother
[19:35] Branham said the Christian life is to go
[19:37] out and redeem other people that's why
[19:40] when somebody hates you and because to
[19:41] talk spitefully about you and slap you
[19:44] across the face and talk behind your
[19:46] back
[19:46] I read the real Christian love of a real
[19:49] Christian individual want to reach out
[19:51] and redeem that person back to God
[19:53] that's what you know that's what real
[19:55] love is
[19:56] to be able to love somebody that hates
[19:58] you and despises you and it doesn't like
[20:00] you to to walk through it say that boss
[20:03] that hates you at your job and treats
[20:05] you wrong
[20:06] my what kind of a lovely life to be able
[20:09] to want to redeem somebody like that to
[20:13] look down from across and say Father
[20:15] forgive them they know they don't know
[20:17] what they're doing to be like Steven and
[20:19] safe forgive them they don't know what
[20:20] they're doing and to be able to speak
[20:22] those things to people that are stoned
[20:24] and to speak those things to somebody
[20:26] that was crucified on the cross that's a
[20:28] real Christian life brother Brent said
[20:33] let's pull up all the days of our life
[20:35] he said you may be a slave to your
[20:38] religion paragraph 25 you may be a slave
[20:41] to a bunch of Crees and let me tell you
[20:44] a Creed's is nothing but framework for a
[20:46] communism it's the scaffold work that
[20:48] the devil can use to build communism as
[20:50] a cold formal Church for men and women
[20:53] will go to that church and become a
[20:55] slave to their religion become a slave
[20:57] to the devil going into the church and
[20:59] putting your name on the book and
[21:01] putting money into it or either they'll
[21:03] go there and there's nothing said about
[21:04] role tonight I want to speak about Rome
[21:10] there is a wrong and there's a right and
[21:13] you know what you know I did this is my
[21:15] own personal conviction why brother
[21:17] Branham was speaking about communism and
[21:19] this quote is because what communism is
[21:22] is when when
[21:23] Mina believes that we all get together
[21:24] as what just one big of a homogeneous
[21:26] group of society and that everybody gets
[21:29] a little slice of the pie but you know
[21:31] what Christianity is not communism
[21:33] Christianity is an individual walk you
[21:36] don't get to joy it's not a just to join
[21:39] and you just come to church and you show
[21:40] up and you you get to particulars of a
[21:42] slice of the slice of the pie just
[21:45] because you're here in the building
[21:46] but you must enter into Christ as a as a
[21:49] personal individual you yourself come
[21:52] come and walk to that pillar of fire you
[21:54] and God alone that back side of the
[21:56] desert experience there brother Adam
[21:57] talked about where you see God for
[21:59] yourself face to face and you know him
[22:02] because you've seen him better I said I
[22:04] don't like to say this but I'm going to
[22:06] say it anyhow I'm not speaking too hard
[22:08] now I hope I'm not I want to say it with
[22:10] seasoned in it but sisters will go
[22:12] through the air and on the streets here
[22:14] in Chicago it's great just gracefully to
[22:16] see them how they would take their
[22:17] clothes off and walk on the street and
[22:19] they seemingly don't know any different
[22:21] they don't realize that they're
[22:22] committing adultery you say well brother
[22:24] branham I know women that a women cannot
[22:27] wear a woman cannot wear shorts without
[22:29] having an evil spirit owner you get that
[22:33] because you might not believe it and her
[22:34] intellectuals but Satan has put that
[22:37] spirit on her to show herself before men
[22:39] and at the Day of Judgment every man
[22:42] that looks at her in the wrong way will
[22:44] be guilty with her for committing
[22:46] adultery with her on the day of the
[22:48] judgement and her pastor don't say
[22:50] nothing about it
[22:51] you see when when a woman is not
[22:53] dressing right and not clothes right she
[22:56] is in bondage that is a sign that she's
[22:58] in bondage when you when you look at a
[23:00] man on the street and he doesn't look
[23:02] like a real man he's got his hair all
[23:04] down over his eyes he can't even lift it
[23:06] he had to lift it up to see his Bible if
[23:08] he were gonna read the Bible that X
[23:10] shows that there's something wrong with
[23:11] him he's in bondage that man is held in
[23:14] bondage and he needs something to
[23:16] liberate him you see if we if we were to
[23:19] look into the Bible the right way we are
[23:21] all guilty and we all come short and
[23:24] we've all fallen short and we all need
[23:26] something to redeem us we all need
[23:28] something to come and and
[23:31] give us that that that sound of freedom
[23:34] you see the Romans chapter 319 says and
[23:38] all the world may become guilty before
[23:40] God therefore by the deeds of the law
[23:42] there shall no flesh be justified in his
[23:45] sight for by the law is the knowledge of
[23:47] sin but you can't do it on your own you
[23:54] know Moses tried Moses tried to free the
[23:57] Egyptian on his own end up killing the
[23:59] Israelites on his own end up killing an
[24:01] Egyptian he tried to do it on his own
[24:03] and if you try to do it on you on your
[24:05] own you'll mess up the whole thing
[24:07] you're less you'll mess up the situation
[24:09] and nothing will go right and you'll
[24:10] begin to think that you'll begin to
[24:12] wonder wait what am I doing wrong
[24:15] like like Moses did when he went out
[24:17] into the wilderness and brother Aaron
[24:19] said he began to lose the feeling for
[24:21] the deliverance of the people he began
[24:23] to as friends he wandered in the
[24:24] wilderness for forty years just kind of
[24:26] sitting out there doing herding the
[24:28] Sheep and everything he began to wonder
[24:29] if it was still possible maybe I said
[24:32] like they began to kind of forget about
[24:34] the deliverance of the Israelites and
[24:36] then one day he met the pillar of fire
[24:39] and I believe that's what we all need
[24:41] every one of us sit here tonight we need
[24:43] our own experience with the pillar of
[24:45] fire because the pillar of fire will
[24:48] reveal to you the plan and purpose for
[24:50] your life it will reveal to you the will
[24:52] of God in your life it will reveal to
[24:54] you who Jesus Christ is
[24:56] because that's who that pillar of fire
[24:58] is we need a personal experience with
[25:01] that pillar of fire a backside of the
[25:03] desert experience this brother branham
[25:04] sitting out now we don't go to the
[25:06] backside of the desert like we got to
[25:07] find the desert and go wandering around
[25:09] or anything but we get to a place like
[25:11] Moses did where I need something I've
[25:14] got to find something a desperation and
[25:16] then God will meet you because the Bible
[25:19] says if you'll draw nigh unto me I will
[25:21] draw nigh unto you if you there's
[25:24] something in you draw and been hungry
[25:25] for God then run to him and he'll draw
[25:28] nigh unto you John chapter 8 34 to 35
[25:33] says Jesus answer then verily verily I
[25:36] say unto you whosoever committeth sin is
[25:38] the servant of sin if you commit sin you
[25:41] the servant of sin if your if your
[25:43] living in unbelief you were the servant
[25:45] of a belief and the servant abideth not
[25:47] in the house forever but the son abideth
[25:49] ever if the son therefore shall make you
[25:55] free ye shall be free and deed which
[26:01] goes on into this scripture that we were
[26:03] reading earlier Exodus chapter 21 one
[26:05] two seven now these are the judgments
[26:08] with the south-south set before them if
[26:11] thou by and the hebrew service six years
[26:13] he shall serve in the seventh he shall
[26:15] go out free for nothing well you see
[26:19] what would happen is it in the Bible and
[26:22] there's a few different instances of
[26:24] different stories in the Bible where
[26:25] there's the one where the little the
[26:27] little lady she got in a situation with
[26:30] dead and they beget the debtors were
[26:32] going to come the people that she owed
[26:34] money to were going to come and take her
[26:36] to her two sons away and then Elijah
[26:39] came on the scene and resolved that
[26:40] situation for but you see what if you if
[26:43] you got into a situation of debt then
[26:45] your children could be so sold off into
[26:48] debt until to pay that price to work
[26:51] until the the price had been paid you
[26:54] see what happened was Adam led when he
[26:56] sinned in the garden sold us all in the
[26:58] debt and all of his children got sold
[27:00] got sold away until the debt was paid
[27:02] but unfortunately that's a debt that we
[27:04] could never pay how can you pay the sin
[27:06] that you cannot you can't pay that debt
[27:08] just like all of these people that like
[27:10] the little widow woman there that I was
[27:13] just telling about how how could she pay
[27:14] that debt how could she pay a debt to
[27:17] get to get out of the obligation that
[27:19] she had to make their only way was if
[27:22] God would come on the scene and make a
[27:24] way for you to be for you to come out of
[27:27] that bondage come out of that situation
[27:29] where the taskmaster is cracking that
[27:31] whip and telling you what time you can
[27:33] rise and what time you can go to sleep
[27:35] and where it go over there and hold a
[27:36] little bit and go over there and trim
[27:39] these hedges and all of those kinds of
[27:41] things the only way that you can get out
[27:42] of that situation if as if God makes a
[27:45] way the God made it wait here in this
[27:47] verse he said six years he shall serving
[27:49] in the seventh he shall go out free for
[27:52] nothing three for another in other words
[27:54] you don't have to do anything to be free
[27:57] there is no price that you have to beat
[28:00] to pay to be free they said I'm an a man
[28:04] working in bondage he would find himself
[28:06] helpless under the power of his master
[28:09] like somebody drinking alcohol under the
[28:11] power that might somebody doing drugs I
[28:13] I can't get away from it how can I get
[28:16] away from it or somebody just living in
[28:18] that Carlos state of sin not
[28:20] understanding that the true nature of
[28:22] life and all of these kind of things but
[28:28] then God made a way and he said you can
[28:30] get out of the pawn shop for free you
[28:33] don't have to you don't have to pay the
[28:35] minister you don't have to thank anybody
[28:38] you don't have to give a speech aren't
[28:42] you glad when you got saved you didn't
[28:44] have to get up and give a speech to a
[28:45] big crowd you don't have to do anything
[28:47] there's no obligation to salvation you
[28:50] don't even have to be a preacher
[28:52] that's preachers that we're not
[28:53] preaching to be saved we're preaching
[28:55] because we love the Lord Jesus and we
[28:57] feel a call in our life and we got
[28:59] something to say and we want to help
[29:01] somebody you don't have to make a
[29:03] donation you don't even have to be a big
[29:06] shot you don't have to dress a certain
[29:08] way you don't have to wear a fancy
[29:10] clothes you don't have to do nothing to
[29:13] be to be safe you don't have to thank
[29:16] God for this you don't have to know a
[29:18] lot you could be a whole ignorant
[29:20] fisherman like Peter and just just like
[29:22] come out come out and out of the fishing
[29:24] boat can't even read or write and just
[29:27] hear the preaching of the gospel and all
[29:29] of a sudden that ignite in his heart and
[29:31] he's he's telling everybody how to climb
[29:34] the Statue for perfect baby you don't
[29:36] have to know anything all you have to
[29:38] know is Jesus Christ and him crucified
[29:40] that's all you have to know you don't
[29:42] have to listen there is it is free for
[29:44] nothing you can come out free for
[29:47] nothing
[29:48] and it says if his master I've given him
[29:50] a wife and she had borne him sons or
[29:52] daughters the wife and her children
[29:53] shall be her masters and he shall go out
[29:56] by himself so there's still restrictions
[29:58] can't everybody can't come out yet
[30:00] there's still restriction
[30:04] you know I think a lot of times a lot of
[30:08] times preachers will kind of hold back a
[30:09] little bit but tonight I just want to
[30:11] share exactly what I believe about these
[30:13] kind of scriptures so you could either
[30:15] say well I agree with that or I don't
[30:17] agree with it I believe that the reason
[30:19] that they couldn't come out it's because
[30:21] that's typing something that's of this
[30:23] present day it's type of something that
[30:25] happened down through the seven churches
[30:27] as the people in each age received the
[30:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost there they
[30:32] could come out in their soul as their
[30:33] soul receiving attention and their soul
[30:36] was able to come out to receive their
[30:37] full inheritance but yet their spirit
[30:40] their body but still it could not come
[30:43] out yet something was still left waiting
[30:46] you see something hang it on and so
[30:48] that's that's maybe were you I give you
[30:50] a little glimpse into where I'm going
[30:51] tonight with with this little little
[30:53] message but Paul if you could kind of
[30:56] imagine what as that seventh year
[30:59] approach that people would begin to talk
[31:01] amongst themselves the seventh years
[31:04] coming up when the seventh year comes
[31:05] we're gonna be able to go out we're
[31:08] gonna we're gonna be able to leave we're
[31:09] gonna be able to you know as long as
[31:11] you're willing to leave the fact the
[31:14] wife that you married while you were in
[31:15] bondage the children that you had
[31:17] weren't while you were in bondage as
[31:19] long as you were able to leave all that
[31:20] behind or if you were alone if you're
[31:23] during that time as long as you're able
[31:24] then you can leave and all these things
[31:27] I imagine that kind of a message that
[31:29] began to be shared is similar to the
[31:32] message that was proclaimed in Isaiah 53
[31:34] surely he hath borne our griefs and
[31:36] carried our sorrows in other words the
[31:39] price has already been paid it's not
[31:41] something that we've done but it's
[31:43] something that he has done it's
[31:44] something that carried over all the way
[31:46] from from an exodus when they put that
[31:48] blood over the little of their door and
[31:50] they killed a lamb because the price had
[31:52] been paid the blood it was shown on the
[31:54] little of their door he had already done
[31:56] the work surely he hath borne our griefs
[31:58] and carried our sorrows yet we did
[32:00] esteem him stricken smitten of God and
[32:03] afflicted but he was wounded for our
[32:05] transgressions he was bruised for our
[32:07] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[32:09] was upon him and with His stripes we are
[32:12] healed
[32:12] and we like sheep have gone astray we
[32:15] have turned every one to his own way and
[32:17] the Lord has laid him they on the
[32:19] iniquity of us all on their nikka the
[32:21] only him the iniquity of us all
[32:23] that's the kind of message I believe
[32:25] that will bring us out of bondage to
[32:27] look to him to look to the price that
[32:29] Jesus paid listen this is the best deal
[32:33] that there's been in 2,000 years if I
[32:35] was a if I was a car salesman or
[32:37] something I couldn't make a better sale
[32:38] this is a sale that you don't have to do
[32:40] nothing for you because you imagine
[32:43] going through the car lot and saying I
[32:45] want to buy a car and they say well just
[32:46] come and come and take a car oh you
[32:48] don't have to pay anything for it this
[32:50] is the best deal that there is because
[32:52] you don't have to do anything you don't
[32:54] have to you don't have to pay any money
[32:55] you don't have to work for it
[32:57] it's just freely available in Romans
[33:02] chapter 3 verse 20 Paul said but now the
[33:04] righteousness of God without the law was
[33:07] manifested being witnessed by the law
[33:08] and the prophets even the righteousness
[33:10] of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ
[33:14] unto all and upon all them that believe
[33:16] for there is no difference for all have
[33:19] sinned and come short of the glory of
[33:21] God being justified how freely freely by
[33:26] His grace through the redemption that is
[33:28] in Christ Jesus and the 1st Corinthians
[33:31] chapter 2 Paul said for what man knoweth
[33:33] the things of a man save the spirit of
[33:34] Man which is in him even so the things
[33:37] of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of
[33:39] God now we have received not the spirit
[33:41] of the world but the spirit which is of
[33:43] God that we might know the things that
[33:45] are freely freely given to us of God and
[33:50] it Romans chapter 5 verse 18 therefore
[33:52] as the as by the offence of one judgment
[33:54] came upon all men to condemnation even
[33:57] so by the righteousness of one the free
[34:00] gift came upon all men unto
[34:02] justification of life why do i why don't
[34:05] I kind of integrate over these
[34:06] scriptures because I want to drive home
[34:08] the point that it's free to you it's a
[34:10] free gift it's free it's freely
[34:13] available available you're justified
[34:15] it's justified freely
[34:17] it's that are free these things are
[34:20] given freely given to us of God
[34:25] but you know what
[34:27] and that seventh year that free gift was
[34:31] only available to sons the house that
[34:36] game under dead and and and the person
[34:39] that owned that house wouldn't have to
[34:41] give that house over to whoever they owe
[34:43] the long gotta loan the money or
[34:45] whatever for and within that house were
[34:48] sons but with also also within that
[34:50] house were service and the sons and the
[34:52] service would all go out into bondage
[34:54] while they were in bondage they would
[34:56] work together and you couldn't tell a
[34:58] son apart from a server they were all
[35:00] working in the field together and you
[35:01] didn't know who was who because they
[35:03] were working side by side they all had a
[35:05] hole in their hand and they were all
[35:07] working in the field together but when
[35:09] that seventh year came the son got to go
[35:11] out but the servant remain in bondage
[35:13] the serve the son begat to go home back
[35:16] to their inheritance and you see when
[35:18] you hear this gospel proclaimed because
[35:20] your sons that he said in spirit in your
[35:23] heart crying I'm a father he was your
[35:25] son's before the foundation in the world
[35:27] because God knew and he knew that you
[35:29] would receive it he had it waiting for
[35:31] you you were predestinated to hear it
[35:33] you were predestined to know it by
[35:34] foreknowledge he knew that she would
[35:36] receive it and so because he knew it he
[35:39] had an inheritance waiting for you and
[35:41] when you hear the gospel proclaiming
[35:43] that proclaiming your Liberty you can
[35:45] return back to that inheritance back to
[35:48] the eternal word that was there before
[35:50] the foundation of the world that gave
[35:52] that word is imparted to you listen to
[35:54] the youth it's the son only sons can go
[35:57] back only sons and therefore you must be
[36:01] born again
[36:02] just because you join a church or you
[36:05] come to church or you pay your tithes or
[36:07] all those things does not entitle you to
[36:09] this inheritance just because your mama
[36:12] and your daddy to believe the message of
[36:13] us because just because the people that
[36:15] you're associated with believe it and
[36:17] they're good people
[36:18] that does not entitle you to that
[36:20] inheritance brother I'm told that story
[36:22] about this a sister to said I burn a
[36:24] candle every night and he said what's
[36:26] that got to do with Christianity
[36:27] well what's God being a good person got
[36:30] to do with being a girl with
[36:31] Christianity we you
[36:33] to be born again you know so many people
[36:36] conflate being born again with with it
[36:39] with being an American we pull up put a
[36:41] flag behind us and that somehow entitles
[36:44] us to be to Christianity or to say I'm a
[36:46] Christian or if we go to we go to
[36:48] Dollywood for a vacation and we go to
[36:50] the little singin's and things and
[36:52] listen to the songs and Christian songs
[36:54] and all that that has nothing to do with
[36:56] being born again you must be born again
[36:59] and you must receive the word and your
[37:02] into your soul open up the channel of
[37:05] your heart so that God Himself can come
[37:07] in and make himself alive to you Bela
[37:13] I'm said in the message Jubilee year he
[37:15] said I remember myself oh my when I
[37:17] heard that good news coming to my heart
[37:19] as a little old sinner boy laying in on
[37:21] the hospital bed the doctor says you got
[37:23] three more minutes to live I heard a
[37:26] sound from heaven that told me Jubilee
[37:27] Jubilee year was old I accepted the Lord
[37:30] Jesus turn loose all the shackles of sin
[37:33] and said to the devil you can't do me
[37:35] any more harm because I've give my life
[37:38] to Christ Jesus and you can't whip me
[37:40] anymore
[37:40] since then he's bluffed me lots of times
[37:43] but he's not been able to touch me since
[37:45] because he's just a bluff I can hear his
[37:47] whip cracking and popping and so forth
[37:49] but it don't do no good because he can't
[37:52] get me because I belong to the Lord now
[37:55] that's right listen when you give your
[37:57] soul to the Lord and God verse gives you
[38:00] a word birth that's something that word
[38:03] down in your soul as something that the
[38:05] gates of Hell cannot prevail against the
[38:08] devil can't touch that down in your soul
[38:12] we skip over some of these just to kind
[38:15] of keep moving my brother around said in
[38:17] the mark of the beast and the seal of
[38:19] God he said let me give you a little
[38:21] scripture here just for a minute I want
[38:23] you to turn with me to Exodus so you
[38:24] don't have to just mark it down Exodus
[38:26] 21 6 if a slave had been sold out and
[38:29] there come the year of Jubilee the year
[38:32] of Jubilee the Jubilee priest sounded
[38:33] the trumpet
[38:34] how many knows that the trumpet was the
[38:36] trumpet and he sounded it and when he
[38:38] did every slaves could go by free to his
[38:40] home if he was out in the field chopping
[38:42] with a hoe and somebody I lost my place
[38:47] somebody over here whipping him with a
[38:48] whip and here what was that what was
[38:50] that gospel troupe it sounding the good
[38:53] news
[38:53] throw that hoe down and turn a ride
[38:55] around and say you have no more rule
[38:57] over me
[38:57] going home to my wife and kids I was
[39:00] sold over here in slavery but you hear
[39:02] that trumpet sounding that means that
[39:04] I'm a Hebrew I have a right I'm a
[39:07] birthright and man I have a right I can
[39:10] go free without anybody's money not if
[39:14] you'll do this so you do that see the
[39:16] whole thing was grace not if you will
[39:19] but if you'll hear the trumpet the
[39:22] jubilee year
[39:23] the Lord preached the acceptable year
[39:25] the Jubilee year how we could but I'm
[39:27] watching that guy he said see hearing
[39:30] faith cometh by for what hearing now not
[39:33] not just listen with your ear but if you
[39:35] hear that means you understand it accept
[39:38] it see what hearing means he that
[39:41] believeth and hears my words that to
[39:43] hear to understand when you when you sit
[39:45] in a church and you begin to understand
[39:47] the preaching of the gospel and against
[39:49] the sink down then you're accepting
[39:51] something real I hear you I believe it
[39:53] he says see is hearing let's skip on
[39:56] down but you can come to Christ and be
[39:58] sealed by the Holy Ghost you can take
[40:00] your choice now watch you hear the
[40:03] gospel Trump what is the gospel trumpet
[40:05] the good news the Holy Ghost is here how
[40:09] do you know it how do you know it is
[40:11] watch it work see what it does it's the
[40:14] good news the good news is the sound of
[40:17] freedom that you can go free that you
[40:19] can come up and rise out of bondage that
[40:21] you can throw your hoe down but you got
[40:24] a choice whether to throw that hole down
[40:26] whether to keep it in your head and keep
[40:29] working and that's why it says in Exodus
[40:33] chapter 121 if the service shall plainly
[40:38] say I love my master my wife and my
[40:42] children
[40:43] I will not go out free then his master
[40:46] shall bring him under the judges he
[40:48] shall also bring him to the door under
[40:50] the doorpost and his mastership bore his
[40:53] ear through with an awl and he shall
[40:55] serve him forever and I know many a you
[40:58] know we're all acquainted with what that
[41:00] and everything but I just want to take a
[41:02] little liberty tonight just just kind of
[41:03] break this down because you see the
[41:06] Bible says that faith comes by hearing
[41:08] the word and so when that when that that
[41:11] Gospel message goes out that you can be
[41:13] free and you say well you know what I'd
[41:15] rather just keep the ho in my hand and
[41:18] you and and it's like he's really like a
[41:20] proposal the the the bridegroom keeps
[41:23] coming and saying well will you be mine
[41:25] will you be mine and the little lady
[41:27] says I but you know I'm just not right
[41:30] now
[41:31] not now I'm sorry maybe come back in a
[41:34] year and I'll give you my answer then
[41:35] and it comes back you know that's how
[41:37] patient God is with us we come to
[41:40] revival meetings and we come to go to
[41:42] camps and all of those things and we
[41:43] hear the minister's preaching hard and
[41:45] won't you come won't you come once you
[41:47] give your life to him and you just see
[41:50] you sit there and you say well I'd I'd
[41:51] rather just keep the hole in my hand
[41:53] I'd rather keep hoeing in bondage I
[41:55] prefer bondage overcoming free and after
[41:58] a while and your heart begins to be
[42:00] seared as the Bible says it's like a hot
[42:02] iron there's like an iron being applied
[42:04] to your soul until your soul just can't
[42:07] respond anymore it doesn't it doesn't
[42:09] hear anymore and after a while like like
[42:11] that story that brother and I'm told of
[42:13] that that girl that she said well I
[42:15] remember when you told me I needed to be
[42:17] saved but now after a while it got to
[42:20] where I could look at my old mama
[42:22] roasted in hell and I'd laugh at it
[42:26] because you imagine having a heart a
[42:28] heart that had been so hard and why was
[42:31] it hardened like that because she said
[42:33] I'd rather keep holing I'd rather stay
[42:36] in bondage I'd rather keep the hole in
[42:39] my hand then turn loose and accept the
[42:41] gospel of liberation I'd rather keep
[42:44] holing than listen to the sound of
[42:46] freedom
[42:46] and after a while her heart just got so
[42:49] hard brother Branham said hey and if it
[42:52] said that message
[42:54] Joe in the message job he said I told
[42:55] her young lady I believe God's calling
[42:58] you nice sister she said if I want
[43:00] somebody to talk to me I don't want
[43:01] somebody that's got more sense about it
[43:03] but my can you believe that and I said
[43:09] well sister I can only say the Holy
[43:11] Spirit is telling me she said I don't
[43:14] want to hear that no more that's the
[43:17] same thing as saying I'd rather keep
[43:19] hoeing then then accept what you got to
[43:22] say
[43:22] a year later I passed through that city
[43:24] and that girl had become a prostitute
[43:26] her clothes hanging low owner offered me
[43:29] a drink of whiskey and she said and I
[43:30] shamed her and she said you know what
[43:32] preacher you remember the night you told
[43:34] me I ought to be saved I said yes I do
[43:36] she said that was the truth said I've
[43:38] crossed the separating line there I
[43:40] grieved God from my heart the last time
[43:43] said here's the remark that girl made
[43:45] said I could see my mother's soul fry
[43:47] and hill like a pancake and laugh at it
[43:50] hard hearted and in the Old Testament
[43:53] what they would do when somebody was
[43:55] unwilling to let go that hole was they
[43:57] would take their take their ear to that
[43:59] post but they rear up to that post and I
[44:02] believe it was the post where they had
[44:04] once put that lambs blood over it but
[44:07] where they were that they had escaped
[44:08] out of out of out of out of bondage and
[44:12] Israel a sign that she was rejecting the
[44:14] Lambs blood rejecting the price that
[44:16] Jesus paid that person was rejecting
[44:19] that and they would nail that all put
[44:21] that all through the year they are they
[44:23] are the ear that would never again could
[44:25] never again be touched by the God the
[44:27] preaching of the gospel because it had
[44:30] been seared over listen I think a lot of
[44:34] times we think we think sometimes that
[44:36] that Christian burden is it's gonna be
[44:40] more heavier heavier than than just
[44:42] staying in bondage and living under the
[44:45] weight of the devil and all this guy
[44:46] yeah I was remember reading in Paul John
[44:50] Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress about early
[44:53] on in the beginning of that book the
[44:56] pilgrim is walking around and he's got a
[44:58] big old cycle on his back and he's
[45:00] weighted down by the law
[45:02] it's got he's got like a big old burden
[45:03] and you know that that's many times
[45:06] that's what people think that Christian
[45:08] life is this that you walk around with a
[45:10] big old burden on your head on your back
[45:11] and you're you're trying to do although
[45:13] all these do's and don'ts and you're
[45:15] trying to live right and trying to do
[45:17] right listen to Christian burden is not
[45:19] Grievous because that's Christ living
[45:22] his life outward through you
[45:24] and you don't have to do anything except
[45:27] yield to him and believe his word and
[45:29] just keep eating a sheep don't have to
[45:31] do anything to bear wool all it does is
[45:34] keep eating it out from that the body of
[45:36] that sheet comes wool I know this is
[45:41] maybe I'm heading on some things that
[45:44] we're all very familiar with but try to
[45:46] stick some toothpicks in your eyes and
[45:48] stay awake just a little bit longer hang
[45:50] on with me now the Christian burden is
[45:54] not Grievous because Jesus said he said
[45:55] coming to me all you that labor it are
[45:57] heavy laden and I will give you rest if
[46:00] you've got a big old heavy burden come
[46:02] to me and and I'll carry it for you I'll
[46:04] be the burden bearer I'll carry all your
[46:06] burdens he said take my yoke upon you
[46:09] and learn of me for I am meek and lowly
[46:11] in heart and ye shall find rest in your
[46:14] souls for my yoke is easy and my burden
[46:16] is light my yoke is easy you know you
[46:19] know what that means when you yoke up
[46:21] two oxen and they're both usually
[46:23] usually the way it works is they're both
[46:25] pulling with the same amount of load but
[46:28] this kind of yoke is different because
[46:30] Jesus is the one doing all the work and
[46:32] you're just yoked up to him you're
[46:34] walking along with him but he's the
[46:36] burden bearer he's the one that's he's
[46:38] the one that's living the life he's the
[46:40] one that takes care of your body when
[46:41] you kneel and he's the one that takes
[46:44] care of the salvation of your children
[46:46] what you think all hope is gone he's the
[46:48] one that's going to that's going to
[46:50] bring us to a body change I couldn't
[46:52] live in our own selves take us to a body
[46:54] change but he's the one that's bearing
[46:56] the burden the first Peter it says
[46:59] humble yourselves therefore under the
[47:00] mighty hand of God that he may exalt you
[47:03] in due time casting all your care upon
[47:05] him for he careth for you but what a
[47:09] great blessing that we have access to to
[47:11] be able to cast all of our cares all of
[47:15] our worries when we were and Fred and
[47:17] more great air sprout as we get older
[47:20] and and all those kind of things that
[47:22] we're fretting about whether our kids
[47:24] are gonna get home safely at night and
[47:26] whether we're gonna they're gonna be
[47:29] able to do this and that and all these
[47:30] kind of things can the Bible says
[47:33] all that on him cast all your burdens on
[47:38] him why because the Christian burden has
[47:40] not Grievous it's a light load we should
[47:44] be able to walk with a spring and a
[47:46] stand our step and a song in our heart
[47:48] because Jesus has taken we're walking
[47:51] with him he's carrying a parent all the
[47:53] yoke were yoked up with him he's the one
[47:57] Matthew chapter 23 I want to hit this
[47:59] real quick Matthew chapter 23 or for
[48:01] says for they bond
[48:02] jesus was talking about the Pharisees
[48:04] and the Sadducees for they bind heavy
[48:06] burdens and grievous to be borne and lay
[48:09] them on men's shoulders but they
[48:10] themselves will not move them with one
[48:12] of their fingers and that's what many
[48:14] ministers do that's what many people in
[48:16] the message do they make the message
[48:17] something that's a grievous burden but
[48:20] it's a it's a light thing to be borne if
[48:25] it's a heavy burden maybe you're the one
[48:28] that's carrying all the weight but give
[48:30] it over to Jesus and let him bear the
[48:32] burden and see what happens listen Jesus
[48:39] has made a way God has made a way for us
[48:42] to escape when I was thinking about
[48:45] McDaniel down there in Babylonian
[48:47] captivity where they were having - just
[48:49] like the Egyptians they were they were
[48:51] living in a situation that they did not
[48:53] have control over outside of their
[48:55] inheritance and Daniel began to look
[48:57] into the books of Jeremiah I began to be
[48:59] reminded of the fact that now they were
[49:01] about to be released from their bondage
[49:04] that now something was about to happen
[49:05] to allow them to return back to their
[49:08] inheritance and and out after 70 years
[49:11] they did all of these things begin to
[49:13] rapidly unfold and before long the
[49:16] people were back in there and aired us
[49:17] and we read all these things about the
[49:20] prophecies of Daniel how they in 49
[49:23] years for the rebuilding of Jerusalem
[49:25] and then 434 years - most sixty-two
[49:27] weeks - Messiah the Prince and then
[49:29] Messiah the Prince came on the scene
[49:31] suddenly and and he went into the temple
[49:33] and preached these words that tie in to
[49:36] the scripture that I read earlier that I
[49:38] was talking about the year the city
[49:40] after seven years seven times seven
[49:42] something is going to
[49:44] he said the Spirit of the Lord God is
[49:46] upon me and I was a chapter 61 because
[49:48] the Lord hath anointed me to preach good
[49:50] tidings under the meek he has sent me to
[49:53] bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim
[49:55] Liberty to the captives and the opening
[49:57] of the prison to them that are bound to
[50:00] proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord
[50:03] and we know by the preaching of the word
[50:05] of the message that that acceptable the
[50:07] year of the Lord is that Jubilee year
[50:10] the Jubilee year that yet of which you
[50:12] can go free let me let me talk a little
[50:19] slower so you can understand me
[50:24] you see they're all down through
[50:26] scripture the Jubilee had been
[50:28] identified as the blowing of that
[50:30] chauffeur that when they when the
[50:32] chauffeur was blown in the 49th year
[50:34] that they could go free but now Jesus
[50:36] says he stood there in the temple
[50:38] identified it not with the blowing of a
[50:40] horn but with the preaching of the
[50:42] gospel and with the preaching of the
[50:44] gospel the people would be liberated to
[50:47] proclaim Liberty to the captives to the
[50:49] people that were in bondage
[50:50] that you could go free so the opening of
[50:53] the prisoner then that are bound to open
[50:55] the dopant up the prison door so that
[50:57] the people could go free and you see if
[51:00] the people would receive Jesus's message
[51:02] it would have been a golden a golden age
[51:05] to them if they would have not rejected
[51:07] that capstone ministry it would have
[51:09] been a golden age just like it was when
[51:12] Solomon shared his wisdom with the
[51:14] people that would have had a golden age
[51:16] but but they rejected that message and
[51:19] so something will something because
[51:21] something was waiting until the end time
[51:28] skip skip over some of these things
[51:33] let's read Leviticus chapter 25 8 to 10
[51:36] this is a now shalt number seven seven
[51:39] of years under these seven times seven
[51:41] years in the space of the seventh
[51:42] Sabbath's of years shall be under the
[51:44] forty and nine years then shalt thou
[51:47] call the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound
[51:49] on the tenth day of the seventh month
[51:50] and the day of atonement sure you make
[51:53] the trumpet sound throughout all your
[51:54] land
[51:55] and you shall hallow the fiftieth year
[51:57] and proclaim liberty throughout all the
[51:59] land unto all the inhabitants thereof it
[52:01] shall be a jubilee unto you and usually
[52:03] return every man unto his possession and
[52:06] he shall return every man unto his
[52:08] family so you see if I could just put
[52:10] this into a little illustrative story
[52:12] down down through the seven churches
[52:14] after the baptism at all ago spell at
[52:16] Pentecost the people began to that every
[52:19] seven years say you say let's say ever
[52:22] so many years of revival would break
[52:24] forth and people would come to meetings
[52:25] and they would they would they would be
[52:27] they would they would be released from
[52:29] their bondage every seven years we'll
[52:31] say like every seven years that Paul
[52:34] would begin to preach his ministry and
[52:35] then Iranians would preach his ministry
[52:37] and Martin would preach it under those
[52:39] ministries people were to hear that
[52:40] message of liberation and they would go
[52:42] free but yet they couldn't go free
[52:44] completely just like in the Old
[52:46] Testament how your your family if you
[52:48] got married your family if he found it
[52:50] got a wife and you had children when you
[52:52] were in bondage those people come and
[52:54] come out and so now now even though
[52:56] they've got the new birth even though
[52:58] they're marching marching and out of
[53:00] bondage in their soul yet they couldn't
[53:02] come all the way out but then down at
[53:06] the end of time after the seven seven
[53:08] seven seven times seven is forty-nine
[53:10] then a trumpet is supposed to be sound
[53:13] sounded the trumpet is supposed to sound
[53:15] that will give you liberation
[53:17] you see we there's more to there's more
[53:20] to the Christian story than just being
[53:22] born again there's more to this than
[53:25] that there's more to Liberty than just
[53:27] deliverance from drinking and smoking
[53:29] and gambling there's more to this story
[53:32] than just being born again and living a
[53:34] good Christian life in the church we're
[53:36] marching toward complete deliverance
[53:38] complete restoration full Redemption so
[53:41] that we can fully return back to the
[53:43] inheritance that was lost in the Garden
[53:45] of Eden and you see hearing that trumpet
[53:49] hearing that trumpet sound hearing that
[53:52] gospel trumpet preached is the only
[53:54] requirement for your Liberty when that
[53:57] gospel TripIt in the Old Testament
[53:58] sounded you didn't have to be there to
[54:01] see the
[54:02] daaad but you didn't even have to be
[54:04] there to see this the person blowing the
[54:07] trumpet all you had to do was hear that
[54:10] trumpet hear that message proclaimed
[54:13] announcing that your bondage was over
[54:15] that you could go free and then you drop
[54:18] your hoe and say I receive it I believe
[54:20] it
[54:21] but you got to drop your hoe maybe I
[54:23] should have titled that just something
[54:25] tonight you got to drop your hose
[54:27] because that's that's the whole that
[54:29] whole point of this you got to drop your
[54:30] you got to drop your hold her to be born
[54:33] again you got to drop your hoe to go up
[54:36] the statue of a perfect man and you got
[54:39] to drop your hoe to go into the capstone
[54:41] revelation because that is that is what
[54:44] the shout of freedom in the shout of
[54:46] freedom as the voice of the seven
[54:48] thunders they opens the seven open seals
[54:51] that declare your liberation they speak
[54:54] out that you are free that is the shout
[54:57] of freedom to you you see many
[55:01] communities many tonight maybe I've
[55:04] escaped the bondage of the world and our
[55:06] souls have been sealed in by the new
[55:08] birth but in our spirit Satan has us in
[55:11] bondage by will say a disease of the
[55:13] Spirit maybe tonight you could hear
[55:16] born-again sitting here and sealed in
[55:18] and your and down in your soul but in
[55:20] your spirit you're still thinking well I
[55:22] don't know if I'm good enough I wonder
[55:24] if I'm really born again like sister
[55:26] Sheppard I wonder it because yeah as you
[55:29] eat the word I begins to open up to you
[55:31] and it begins to or you're the real
[55:33] place that you're in and and the place
[55:36] of the message and all of these things
[55:37] begin to put up you yeah you begin to
[55:39] wonder because in your spirit you're
[55:42] you're wondering things I don't know if
[55:44] I can take a body change I don't know if
[55:47] the Lord really wants to heal me you
[55:49] know brother Brent said we can barely
[55:51] have faith for a toothache how are we
[55:52] gonna have faith for a rapture but you
[55:56] see you can be born again and not quite
[55:58] have faith for a toothache but you've
[56:01] got to be born again and have faith for
[56:02] a rapture
[56:04] you've got to get rid of that disease of
[56:06] the Spirit and the way to get rid of
[56:08] that disease of the Spirit is by
[56:10] listening to that Jubilee trumpet that's
[56:12] been sounded us that's the purpose of
[56:14] the Jubilee trumpet and by the Jubilee
[56:16] trumpet I'm talking about the message of
[56:17] the hour that we've heard the purpose of
[56:19] the message of the hour is to give us
[56:21] rapturing faith to give us faith to know
[56:24] that you have escaped bondage that
[56:26] you've come out of the things in this
[56:28] world that you've climbed it for stature
[56:30] a perfect man that your memories and
[56:33] consciousness affection imagination have
[56:35] not been done away with but have been so
[56:37] lined up that the flues are opened up
[56:39] that God can work through a perfect
[56:41] channel in your life that when you
[56:43] reason its reasoning upon the Word of
[56:45] God its reasoning by the Word of God
[56:48] not reasoning where you're questioning
[56:50] and everything but you know that His
[56:52] Word it's true your flus are cleared up
[56:55] then you've got the sound of freedom you
[56:58] heard the sound of freedom the sound of
[57:00] your liberation and you know that you've
[57:02] been set free
[57:05] you see that's what that's what brother
[57:07] Dale has been preaching on it and
[57:09] brother Wade about Hebrews 11 and these
[57:11] all having obtained a good report
[57:13] through faith received and received not
[57:16] the promise God having provided some
[57:18] better thing for us that they without us
[57:21] should not be made perfect he's provided
[57:24] something better for us something better
[57:27] Jubilee message the sound of freedom to
[57:31] identify to you that not only your soul
[57:33] can return back to your inheritance but
[57:36] your spirit and your body can go back
[57:38] your spirit and your body can be
[57:40] completely redeemed the message of fully
[57:42] different full Redemption you see how
[57:48] why even in the scripture how it says on
[57:55] the tenth day of the seventh month do
[57:59] you do you know I believe that that's
[58:02] identifying the message that we've heard
[58:04] with its placement in the scripture that
[58:08] is spoken of in Revelation chapter ten
[58:10] verses seven eight but in the days of
[58:13] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[58:15] shall begin to sound
[58:16] that is that jubilee message that we've
[58:19] heard the mystery of God should be
[58:21] finished as he hath declared to his
[58:23] service to prophecy the voice which I
[58:26] heard from heaven spake unto me now
[58:28] here's the part that everybody doesn't
[58:30] like here's the part it goes from the
[58:33] from the prophets speaking a message of
[58:35] freedom to you taking that message of
[58:38] freedom and receiving it and eating it
[58:41] so that you become the message of
[58:44] freedom you become that Jubilee message
[58:47] and the voice which I heard from heaven
[58:49] spake unto me again and said go and take
[58:52] the little book which is open in the
[58:54] hand of the angel which standing upon
[58:57] the sea and upon the earth dude do you
[59:00] realize the identification with that
[59:02] voice and this age when let me go find
[59:06] that scripture when Jesus was talking to
[59:10] Peter he said I will give unto thee the
[59:12] keys of the kingdom of heaven and
[59:13] whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
[59:15] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[59:18] thou shalt loose on earth shall be
[59:20] loosed in heaven
[59:21] how would he bind and loose by the word
[59:24] that by the revelation of the word that
[59:26] he had would be able to loose or bind do
[59:29] you know when when Jesus called Lazarus
[59:31] out of the grave he said loosed him
[59:34] after Lazarus came out he said loosed
[59:36] him because he was bound and now this
[59:39] gospel and when you receive the voice it
[59:42] gives you power to loose or to bind
[59:45] because you have a revelation of how
[59:47] things work you have a revelation of how
[59:49] the word operates and you're able by the
[59:51] preaching of the gospel to loose people
[59:53] from bondage to loose people from their
[59:55] sins because when you the word goes
[59:58] forth and they receive it they are
[1:00:00] loosed from the bondage that they are in
[1:00:02] that's the power of the gospel the power
[1:00:04] of the gospel is to loose people from
[1:00:06] their bondage it is literally the sound
[1:00:10] of freedom the sound of freedom
[1:00:13] you know what the sound of freedom is
[1:00:15] the sound of freedom is that you were in
[1:00:17] him before the foundation of the world
[1:00:19] because now we have an understanding of
[1:00:21] Genesis 1:26 27
[1:00:23] that sound the freedom was that there
[1:00:25] was a mystery in the back part of God's
[1:00:27] mind and you were the mystery the sound
[1:00:30] of freedom is the seven thunders
[1:00:32] declaring your complete Redemption and
[1:00:35] the sound of freedom is that you are no
[1:00:37] longer you're no longer under Satan's
[1:00:41] Dominion because same good look at a
[1:00:43] real true born again adopted son of God
[1:00:46] and he don't know what to do with that
[1:00:48] person because circling like a vulture
[1:00:50] circling around food and but he just
[1:00:53] can't figure out how to get into that
[1:00:54] person that's fortified behind the Word
[1:00:57] of God in a way that Adam stepped out
[1:01:00] from let me skip through some of these
[1:01:07] in Revelation tier nine to eleven he
[1:01:10] says I went unto the angel at seventy
[1:01:12] him give me the little book and he said
[1:01:14] unto me take it and eat it up and it
[1:01:17] shall make that belly bitter but it
[1:01:19] shall be in that mouth sweet as honey
[1:01:20] and I took the little book out of the
[1:01:23] Angels hand and ate it up and it was at
[1:01:25] my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I
[1:01:27] had eaten it my belly was bitter and he
[1:01:30] said unto me thou must prophesy again
[1:01:32] before many peoples and nations and
[1:01:35] tongues and kings and I know that's been
[1:01:37] preached many times but I just want to
[1:01:39] reiterate again but you've got to
[1:01:41] receive that voice and when you receive
[1:01:44] that voice you become that voice and you
[1:01:48] are able to speak it that's the thing
[1:01:50] that the position that God is trying to
[1:01:52] bring us to he's trying to bring us to a
[1:01:54] place a place from hearing faith -
[1:01:57] speaking faith a place where you have
[1:02:00] heard that voice - a place where now you
[1:02:02] can speak that voice you can speak that
[1:02:05] word you know maybe just says yeah I
[1:02:11] think it's so odd that one of the one of
[1:02:13] the examples of the three pools and
[1:02:15] brother branham's and ministry was
[1:02:16] anything when he went over to Hattie
[1:02:18] Wright's house and you know the story
[1:02:20] goes that she was she was she was living
[1:02:22] off a little $200 a year income and she
[1:02:25] had given 40 bucks I think was to the
[1:02:27] building fund and and brother never
[1:02:28] would have given 20 bucks to her to kind
[1:02:30] of give it back to her brother Branham
[1:02:32] went over there with 20 dollars in his
[1:02:33] pocket he was going to give that to her
[1:02:34] and the Lord spoke to him and said don't
[1:02:36] give her
[1:02:37] twenty dollars I got something for him
[1:02:42] here the tail of that story of the
[1:02:43] squirrels and she said she said listen I
[1:02:47] believe that had a ride in that position
[1:02:49] in that moment she was typing the bride
[1:02:51] because she was receiving the word just
[1:02:54] like you and I ever sees that word and
[1:02:56] then out of her mouth she said she said
[1:02:59] that's nothing but the truth
[1:03:01] you see how simple dropping that hoe is
[1:03:03] when you receive the gospel you drop
[1:03:06] that hoe from your bondage and he said
[1:03:08] what did he tell her he said whatever
[1:03:10] you say you can have but you see because
[1:03:13] the voice of freedom that child of
[1:03:16] freedom I've been putting any right she
[1:03:18] got to say whatever you say whatever you
[1:03:21] want and in that hour she had a perfect
[1:03:26] desire she didn't what money she didn't
[1:03:28] want wealthy fame
[1:03:29] all she wanted it was to deliver and
[1:03:31] stuff her children and I believe tonight
[1:03:33] that if you want deliverance of your
[1:03:35] children it's not really up beyond the
[1:03:37] reach of God it might be beyond your
[1:03:45] reach it might be up beyond the things
[1:03:48] that you can do it you're all moral
[1:03:50] capabilities but it's not beyond his
[1:03:52] reach speaking like Hany right that's
[1:04:01] that's what God is trying to bring this
[1:04:03] to he's trying to bring us to a place
[1:04:05] where you receive the word but now you
[1:04:08] can't speak it you can speak it not
[1:04:11] speaking your own desires but speaking
[1:04:13] like how do you ride ahead that was
[1:04:15] God's desire God's desire is the
[1:04:18] salvation of your family God's desire is
[1:04:21] the salvation of his whole church God's
[1:04:23] desires to bring you to a place of
[1:04:25] adoption a place where you know that
[1:04:27] God's Word is true and all that disease
[1:04:30] of your spirit has been baked out by the
[1:04:32] word and you have complete confidence in
[1:04:35] him that you know who he is and you know
[1:04:37] who you are and you know the day and the
[1:04:40] hour that you're living in
[1:04:41] and you believe you believe it that's
[1:04:44] that's accepting the shout of freedom
[1:04:46] you just believe God and you take him
[1:04:48] and you accept him at his word there's a
[1:04:56] music awaiting come over by the way I'm
[1:05:00] said in the Laodicean Church age you
[1:05:01] said Oh God still has a voice for the
[1:05:05] people of the world even as he has given
[1:05:08] a voice to the bride that voice is in
[1:05:12] the bride
[1:05:13] I believe that voice is in the bride and
[1:05:16] I there's a people that have received
[1:05:18] the message of the hour that have heard
[1:05:21] that Jubilee trumpet that have received
[1:05:23] that have never looked into that open
[1:05:25] book and have taken it from the angel
[1:05:27] and eating it and received it and they
[1:05:30] have become that voice they are the
[1:05:32] voice walking on two feet able to speak
[1:05:35] the word because they know the word and
[1:05:38] tonight if you don't know what I'm
[1:05:40] talking about
[1:05:41] I implore you I encourage you to just
[1:05:44] let go that hope just open your hand Oh
[1:05:48] to free that grasp on that whole would
[1:05:50] just just let that whole drop so that
[1:05:53] God so that you can accept deliverance
[1:05:55] from the bondage that you're in let's
[1:06:00] stand to our feet and just praise the
[1:06:01] Lord a little bit 596 in the spiral
