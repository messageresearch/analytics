back to second Timothy the third chapter just for a quick review you know one of the great things that I look forward to when I come here to visit is fellowship ain't with you Saints but one of the greatest treasures in my life is to be able to spend time quiet time with brother Sam just sitting around in the morning having a cup of coffee and just talking about the word and I just want to be like a magnet when I when I meet somebody who's been around for a lot longer than I have been I'm talking about in the message I used to have a saying if that man sneeze I want to get a handkerchief and catch it and find out find out what's in there and brother Sam is a he's a he's a fountain of wisdom and balance - that's that's the thing I like about brother Sam and brother brother Branham says some people go wild on this side and wild on that side but it's that warm sane gospel that comes right down the middle of the highway and I appreciate that brother Sam amen let's bow our heads just for a moment before we read father we know that you have given us a great privilege of living in the closing moments of time a prophet of God said that when he was here it was three minutes to midnight and I wonder how many seconds to midnight it may be right now Lord we know that time is short we know that you promised to do a quick short work in the end time and when the bride fully realizes who she is and comes to maturity Lord no we're going home so Lord if there's some here that need to be a part of that quick short work the 11th hour workers that need to come in and with the promises they're going to receive the same same reward as those who've labored for a long time I pray Lord that you would quicken their hearts Lord and give them a sense of urgency we ask bless now the word bless the hearts of your people and help me to the get myself out of the way father we ask all these blessings we ask him confidently and your precious name our Lord Jesus Christ amen a second Timothy chapter 3 verse 1 this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come I think every believer should I mean just about anybody in the world could say amen to that perilous that word perilous means dangerous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection trucebreakers false accusers incontinent that word incontinent it means no self-control no self-control fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god having a form of godliness we can see that my youth was raised in a Catholic Church people having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away for this sort are they which creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins led away with divers lusts ever learning ever learning Baptist Methodist Lutheran Catholic Assembly of God PTL UPC on and on and on and on Buddhist Hindu Muslim ever learning but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth Amen god bless you and you can have your seats I want to to share with you a thought that brother Branham shared in that message the invasion of the United States and I think it could be a great lesson surely it was a lesson to me when I first read it because you know so many people that when I first came in the message they were trying to some of them make brother branham more than he was they were trying to make him Jesus Christ and I heard about people being baptized in his name and you know and I went to India and I heard these Christ branding people and they they believed that brother branham's face was in the man in the moon now his brother Brennan's faith and so there was so much wild things going on and brother Branham said in that message the invasion of the United States and this is his closing prayer and like I said brother Branham was the most transparent prophet that there ever was and like all the other ones we just saw little tiny cliffnotes never go into great detail of their home life domestic life financial life all the struggles they went through but brother Branham lived out in the open and any one of those prophets if they if there were social media and their day he you can imagine how they would have blasted them the same way they try to blast the people who are following this message in this day and the reason they're blasting it so hard is because it's the truth and it's the devil's just the devil's job is to try to thwart those who are following truth he hates truth and I want to be a truth broker I want to be a reality broker I want to deal with truth in large doses and strip away all the fluff and all the veneer and get down like brother Branham said to that bare-knuckle truth that's what the bride wants and that's the thing that breaks the fetters that are on people you know sometimes it is so simple it to be set free but the Satan makes you think is going to be so hard to be set free now I've watched people you know who have back slid who have walked away and maybe gone a year two years but when they come back instead of people said well you know we'll see if he's know we ought to be like that like the father of the the prodigal son we ought to be said welcome them just thanking God that he brought them back and Satan tries to bunt no there's no way you can go back and people won't accept you and they'll be looking at you and they'll be remembered no they're gonna if there's a roof they're the only ones you should care about they're gonna welcome you with open arms and so brother branham is saying father while the great darkness is on the battle and the devil invading the countries and invading the pulpits invading the churches invading the people invading the businesses invading the cities and the schools and the homes oh god help us to stand remember now this is 1954 pull the sword quickly and fight for God as Moses and the Levites did down there when sin was in the camp help us Lord and here's what I want to really you know focus on he says forgive us now and bless us and keep us humble break us up Lord Oh God you said he that goeth forth sewing in tears will doubtless return again rejoicing bringing with him sheaves Oh God break us to pieces mold us a new Lord were getting too much out of the way and then he says I am myself Lord I'm getting to a place where I'm thinking about how many will attend the meeting Oh God I want you to come Lord to break me up mold me over don't let me never get those things on my mind keep them from me so here's brother 1954 not brother Branham at that time he was in his forty you know he was not just in here here's a prophet of God and he's so transparent he said here I find myself wondering how many people are gonna come to the meeting he said take that away from me God don't ever let me start thinking about those things and it's like when when brother Branham was saw the works are going on and oru and and and all those people and the devil come and tried to tell him see God can't trust you with all those things that all Roberts and Billy Graham has got the devil tried to put that on him but God came on the scene he said what is that to thee thou hast me they didn't have him they had the buildings they had the money they had the finances they could go where they want to go dress how they want it went first-class air everywhere but brother Brandon went first-class in the supernatural realm because that angel of God travel with him everywhere that he went I know people I know people that are not serving the Lord they were not in the message but they had exposure to brother Branham well I was in Rock Hill South Carolina right after I graduated from Bible school I was in Assembly of God working as a as associate pastor and and then I got the revelation of one God baptism in jesus name in UPC so I tried to come back and tell some of my real close friends about what I was seeing in the word ID so now keep it to yourself and I'll tell you what before long it went to the pastor and I got the left foot of fellowship right out of the best thing that ever happened to me because after that happened to me right after that I met brother Arne go down to the Full Gospel business convention in Orlando so now I'm sin studying the message but there was one sister back in in South Carolina and she was you know she never cut her hair she was about 75 years old and she was going into the nursing home she's 75 years old she's going in there she loved to sing she go in there and she's sing to all the patients a lot of them younger than her so I when I said that I said sister your eyes I've been I've been going through a real learning experience that have you ever heard about name of but my and I'm just kind of stumped yeah you ever heard of a man and I'm almost afraid to say but a William Branham she said William Branham says I was there in Houston in 1950 and she tells she relates the whole story and I didn't know anything about it and she's telling me Reverend best was there and FF Bosworth was there and she and and I'm just sitting there you know blown away the first person I ever met who had experienced personal experience with brother Branham and and she and I was in Lake Charles Louisiana it was the first time I ever heard a pastor and he begged the people not to come to church I said why he said because he knew all the sick people needed to get in the church he was telling the regular people don't come to church let the sick people and she said the people broke the windows in the side of the church building to get into the building that's how desperate they were and so and she said she said to just you you didn't have to wonder when he was there he said you knew when he came in the building just when he came in the building were before the people could even see him there was a presence that came with him when he was the angel of the Lord and the angel of the Lord I believe he's got a glory meter and he can turn that glory meter up as high as he wants to and brother Branham still when that and 19 Falls like in a church service that's the angels walking or walking up and down around the aisles and so we have that you know we have got to we've got to get desensitized to this natural world and get sensitized to the supernatural world God has given us supernatural intelligence and and supernatural intelligence is a decoding of the mysteries that are hitting from the wise and the prudent and revealed the babes such as would believe and it's not anything that would that we did we were born with this seed inside of us we were predestinated before the foundation of the world to believe this word and like I said this word it's the only thing in the world that sounds like it's too good to be true and yet we cannot even begin to imagine what glory waits for those who love Him and call for his purpose on the other side and so as a supernatural see gene of God I want to share with you one more thought or actually two more that one of them is real short you know how brother Branham went when the message first started to be recorded the first message is faith is the substance as 1947 April the 12th and what struck me I mean I hope brother Branham said read between the line because the great mysteries you know they lie between the lines well I read the FIR line the first line of any message that was ever recorded and put into print brother Branham says we're getting some new gadgets for recording very for seven words the voice of the seventh angel were getting some new gadgets for recording I thought that was marvelous you know now that might not mean a lot to a lot of people but to me that's like an exclamation point the the seventh angel the one who was going to reveal all the mysteries he was on the scene and they got some gadget I believe those gadgets were just for recording this message and the way that technology has gone one way that the Internet is the modern tree of the knowledge of good and evil and a lot of evil on it but also this message is being used that take this gospel and spread it all around the world one brother that I met this brother he had 40 translations and he wanted to get them printed and a design translation is hard work difficult work at 40 of them and he wanted those that his work he did it because he loved his people and he wanted to get it into their language and he was told well maybe we can print one maybe at the most to this year now could you imagine how disheartening that would have been for a man to put his blood sweat and tears and time and effort and labor and a put all that into him and they told maybe we can print one or two but now the translators they can work at a feverish pace and as soon as that messages is finished it can be electronically translated and beyond the hub the same day and they can email all the people in that language they can say a new treasure is now available to you brother Branham said don't let this message become common to us don't let the fact that you have 1,100 supernatural nuggets master brother branham never preached the message to me that was not a masterpiece 1100 plus masterpieces that are available to us but you know it becomes common it was like the manner you know the manner when it first came that was with the children wild manna Wow go out there just pick it up eat it Wow the clothes never wore out shoes never wore out nobody was wonderful I wonder how long it took them as well gotta get up gotta go out and get the man you know and it became common to them and then the water you know I think about the people talk about that water that came out they have a little picture of a little rock they have a little a little dribble like coming out of the hey that that was that rock that had had to give two million adults plus the children plus the animal it had the it had to give them all drink every day and they didn't have to have a u-haul to haul that thing around it travel with him talk about him supernatural you can you imagine being well here comes the rock maybe the rock wanted to move ahead you know that make ways but the rock go through and then every night pillar a fire yeah there is right up there pillar of cloud 808 pillar but yeah and I mean and how how how long did it take for them well that's just the way it is I went to Israel visited the friend of mine it was in the business for he told me if you ever get to Israel please come and look me up he was going back to get married his family they wanted the raise their children Israel finally went there went to his kibbutz and he brought me to Mount Carmel and he took me the back road where the tourists can't go because he was in the Special Forces so he had the badge so I went there and I mean you know just to be there and the inner sanctum of where Elijah called down fire upon those prophets and I'm saying Steve I was in this amazing that you can be here right in the middle of where so much supernatural took place he said well it's just our history book that's the way a Jew just our history book they don't think about the super they don't think about the magnificence of how God led them and delivered them and fought their battles they don't think about that it's it doesn't ring in their brain and as you go around and some people you know brother Sam's come to me the Philippines who went to Brazil and brother ways now going to Philippine and oh they been to Jamaican the Caribbean when you go to another culture it takes some time to figure out that those brains they are wired differently than our brain a French brain a German brain an Italian brain the things that are important to them you know maybe we don't think about them maybe we don't know then words I found out in the Philippines you know I used to use a word a brother branham you he brother Bram used the word a bum well in the Philip I said a bomb in him and the whole congregation a bum is a dirty word over in the Philippines and I'm just quoting what a prophet said but in their language it was a watch out for that brother we don't ever say bum when you good and so their minds are wired differently and the brain of a believer is wired so much differently than a unbeliever even you know even somebody who's a good denominational person lives the work walks in as much light as possible their mind is wired so differently so God has come upon the scene and God has given us that supernatural intelligence super natural intelligence and so so brother Branham said in God perfecting his church he says alright I trust that God will grant you my friend maybe not the courage to come I'm not a persuader I like how he said that I'm not a persuader let God do this I've seen hey listen I have seen so many pulls you know pulls from money polls for people who walk down the altar polls for people a speaking I've seen them all I was telling brother Sam brother Branham said there's three kind of believers believers unbelievers and make believers and the three kind of scheppers a feeder of the sheep and a beater of the sheep and a bleeder of the Sheep and I seen a lot of beaters and I seen a lot of bleeder but I'm so thankful for feeders and I'm so thankful that God fed me a supernatural diet puts real muscles on speak not them for the physical I'm talking about spiritual muscles and brother Brad said it put some hair on your chest I don't know how a sister feels about that but you know that's what brother Branham said but you know what he was talking about so he said now he said he am NOT a persuader see the only thing I can do if the Holy Spirit can get you to move my efforts are too poor to do it see what the father has struck at your heart and no man just think what if God wouldn't call though what if God had not rung your belt what if God had not pre-programmed you he said there is people in this world that will never receive the call that'll never come many said Jude now this is what Jude said in the Bible these men of old was foreordained to this condemnation could you imagine if God raised you up to be Pharaoh or God raised you up to be Judas I mean that was that was foreordained God knew that would happen God wants everybody to be saved but because of foreknowledge and predestination he knows who will receive the call and who won't receive the call look at this look at the the rich young ruler now now only brother only a prophet could bring that out the three stages of the rich young ruler you might be rich young and a ruler my talk about position talk about opportunity freedom do anything he wants to but he had the greatest privilege of his life was coming face to face with the Lord Jesus Christ that was his greatest treasure that he had the greatest opportunity that he had and then he had wisdom enough to ask the right question what must I do to inherit eternal life that's the right question that when I started mr. Expo that's the first thing I asked people where do you intend to spend eternity just kind of just like a little a little filler just to you know fertilize their brain get them to start thinking and I said what do you think heavens going to be like when you get to heaven how many gods are you gonna see and I said now when I was young here's what I used to think and I'm just is what I used to think that was going to be kind of like a grandfatherly kind of guy sitting on the big throne with a long beard and and Jesus the Sun he was gonna be on the right hand and we're gonna have the bird and the bird was gonna be eternally treading air over there just flapping around and I said that's what I thought I was gonna see when I was a young boy I said now that's surely that's not what you think it gets real quiet because they don't know what they're gonna see all as they know is the Trinity the Father the Son the Holy Ghost and these three are one that bothered me when I was a young boy I used to ask the nuns I can't understand that how can God be 308 mystery we won't understand these things till we get on get to heaven no I never asked a priest every time I got a new person that it was a religious figure asked the same question got the same answer nobody could understand it so these people are for ordained to this condemnation and to think that God in His goodness tonight jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws him first and all that come will receive everlasting life and God is good enough to knock at your heart tonight and would you be foul enough to refuse him I don't want you go away it's a dangerous thing see oh this people this is what struck me I mean I will never forget this quote he said there is people in eternity tonight out in hell screaming if we could walk and pull open the gate I could just he said walk / and pull open the gate like this and let you look down in there I never have to make much of an altar call they'd be screaming and climbing over one another for the opportunity now forgive me for being a little bit dramatic but in my mind I picture those people just seeing the first crack of light that they'd seen in a long time and somebody just cracked the lid of hell and he said they'd be screaming and climbing over one another for another opportunity but they have passed beyond the veil and beyond mercy now it's too far they can never be redeemed they're gone forever they will never never never be redeemed they had the same opportunity that you have you wouldn't want to take their place tonight would you so why not take the place at the right hand of God to set with him in heavenly places with the Saints so we can't take this mess there's no way we can overestimate the Wonder and the glory and the majesty of what God has done and what he's revealed think about this you know they had a while ago they had some great big lottery one of the biggest lotteries that they ever had could you imagine if you're you know if you were dumb enough to go and buy a ticket first of all now what one brother said well if you did hit the lottery would you have to tithe on it and who would you pay your tithe to so so think about if you had if you had won the lottery would you well you know won the lottery today yeah I'm in the message you know I'm the bride of Jesus Christ you got eternal life dwelling in me never have to die I might I might just go to sleep but I'll wake up and I'll wake up in glory you know a Christian never died that that's me I'll hit the supernatural lottery praise God Lord again and can't say Amen can't say Amen you know I can understand the young people the young people they might as well you know I don't want that boy that I like I don't want him to think I'm a kook or maybe the guy I don't want that girl to think I'm a I have been a kook ever since I became a Christian I'm a front row I want to be at the spout where the glory comes out I very sick the only time I've ever been not on the front row up in my church we got a whole bunch of young uns they're like 10 12 14 years old they want to sit on the front row and they think it's great to come in and get brother Ernie spot Oh so one of them the other he walked in there I walked in there and I saw his Bible and he just they just go when they plant their Bible and they go out in the fellowship hall so I come in there get that Bible and put it behind my back and it's just sat there the young boy come over there looked at his Bible cut down he's looking under the seat and everything you know I just said here's your Bible yeah and their mothers tell me he loves to be on the front row he loves to be down there with you and see there was a sign one time it said make sure that you get the church early or else there won't be any seats left in the back of the church and so here we are living in a world of and sent to ask you a question there there is something in the world it's just a little bit over three pounds and yet it is the Wonder and the amazement and the scorn and the criticism of people all over the world just a little over three pounds and people in every country of the world are talking about it you know what it is Donald Trump's brain that's the brainwaves just a little over three pounds but you think about the life that is in there think about the energy that is in there think about the experience that's in there think about the the courage that's you know all these things now we look at it and I mean I'm not concerned one bit about policy because I was I was in a print shop one time when I was going to Bible School down there in North Carolina I walked up to the counter and I'm waiting I look up there is a big banner white banner with red paint pol I - GICs politics and underneath that it said poly means many and tix means parasite so politics equals many parasites I said that that is good enough for me and then I remember brother Branham said I've never voted one time in my life all right I haven't either you know I felt pretty good about that now brother Brown said now yeah I'm not prep brother friends I'm not proud of it but that's just the way it is he said I voted for Jesus and the devil voted against me so he he was happy with that and you know so so all the stuff that's going on around the world its demons its demons that are coming to their full maturity and they're playing like they're playing they've got a violin and they're playing in the minds of the President and the Vice President and the governors and the mayors and the Senators and the Supreme Court demons friends and we we are the spectators supernatural spectators in the gallery we're getting a preview of what is going to be the great white throne judgment because we are eyewitnesses to the insanity that's going on to the problems in the troubles you know and it's like you know it's like two bulls and a range of putting their heads against each other and you wonder how much good could be could be done if the country had a righteous King brother branham's that's the only kind of government that'll work people say well I want to Republic listen friends it is going to be the religious right that finally is going to put the squeeze on groups law Gus if you don't believe in the Trinity my friends you are a cult we had personal experience we were renting our summer camp from a Bible campground nice campground eight years we were there so one day brother Tom goes there to sign the lease and the man says uh could you give us the mission statement of your church brother Tom civil what do you mean they said well do you believe in the Trinity and brother Tom tried to explain oh we believe you know in father son holy go we believe that that the three but there are different offices that God used and it meant no no no if you don't believe in the Trinity or our bylaws say that if you don't believe in the Trinity that that you're a cult and our bylaws won't allow us to rent our campground to you any longer so for a couple of years we had to scramble around we didn't have facilities very good but we made do you know what happened the campground came up for sale they couldn't afford it anymore and guess who bought it we bought it so they couldn't rent it to his brother dick but they could sell it to us and I believe God might have had a little bit to do with that and so we're looking around and you know do not get involved I mean do not let your emotions get riled up about who says what and this commentator says this and look at this and look look at the deep state look what's going on under don't matter it's demons I am NOT a cheerleader for the devil and his army and his amps I have zero interest I'm an observer but it doesn't bother me one way or the other it's all gonna fall America is gone she's been gone since the late 1950 brother Brennan if she doesn't accept Christ this year she's gone and she's gone and right after that what happened brother Brennan said politics is a beauty and a popularity contest though here comes John Kennedy on the sea I mean you brother Sam he knows one day that would have been unthinkable for a Catholic to be a president of the United States and his dad he had the pull strings had to get the Mafia involved get the unions involved had to get Hollywood involved everybody and they stole the election and you know what happened people I just want to give you just a little insight this is something a treasure that you can just how the Catholic Church operates the Vatican in 1960 they had only one country that they considered to be a Christian country in Asia and that would be the Philippines because the Philippines is about seventy to eighty percent Catholic now we know far from a Christian nation but in the Pope's eyes that was a Christian nation and so he wanted to have another country in Asia to be a Christian nation now John Kennedy comes on the scene and so the Pope goes there and all the intelligentsia all of the Jesuits they go down there and they get this man in South Vietnam and they prop him up and they fund him and they get the propaganda and they make him the president of South Vietnam and in the Pope as mr. Kennedy would you mind sending some advisors over there to help them to get their nation established well sure they send over the advisor and war advisor and more advisors and then they assassinate the guy John Kennedy took that very personal and then it was Katie bar the doors it was like a full-fledged invasion over the years it's a book it was written by a man the name of the book is called Vietnam why did we go and he documents the documents and documents a date by date by date by date how we that's how the Vatican goes there and they have their coup d'etat see my mother sister was a nun and and she was the nun for 16 years before she left the convent to this day she's still alive now she's 84 years old to this day never has told didn't tell her mom or dad which would be my grandmother grandfather didn't tell her brothers her sisters nobody in our family's a big fan never told one person why she left the convent when you become a priest or a nun in the Catholic Church you have access to two passports you have your own passport like American passport and you have a Vatican passport and no country will refuse a Vatican passport and so that's how they have been able to go there and go down there and ferment you know odyssia disunity in the countries down in South America and places over in Asia they go there and they stir they stir things up because it's to their the their mode of and objective and intention to have an influence in that country believe me that that that dragon that beast that serpent he has not changed one iota from what he wanted in the garden he want he wanted to be respected he wanted honor he wanted glory and the only he's not a creator he's just a pervert err so he'd if he could go in there and he could pervert it right from the beginning look at how many tens of millions hundreds of millions even into the billions are worshipping him thinking that they are worshipping God Satan does not care how he gets the glory as long as he gets the glue he doesn't care if it's Buddhist glory Hindu glory Muslim glory Catholic lore he doesn't care what kind of glory as long as he can keep them from what you've got and what I have done that's his great desire our mandate is to establish Christ in this church in our life in the lives of our family we're given token we're giving token power to believe and have faith for those and watch them come in God's path that that power that token is so sometimes underestimated and people well you know I just applied the token it's like they got a little magic wand a little token huh I just you know you fly the token brother branham said if your little child was out there playing in the middle of a highway would you say well Johnny they'll come in out of the highway you might get hurt no it would be an emergency it would be a 9-1-1 situation now I'm not talking about going there shaking them but you know what you might do you might sit and sit down and do a long lost art write them a love letter dear son I love you I have always loved you I will always love you but I love your soul and I am concerned about you I'm concerned about your destiny I'm concerned because you have the truth you have the greatest treasure and yet somehow the enemy is keeping you from this treasure it's like the man who's got ten million dollars in the bank but he can't write a check and that's how our family that's how our friends are you know what's what's their bank account their bank account is that you are their friend you are their mother you are their brother you are their sister you are concerned from that you have got supernatural truth you are the only one many people that I meet I know I am the only person that that person may ever come in contact with in their entire life that is the son of God what a responsibility in that word responsibility if you take the word responsibility and break it down its responsibility having the ability to respond do you have responsibility are you able to respond to the great challenge of today now we don't have that power but God's giving us that power it's God in us not going after them in the flesh but going after them in the spirit a phone call you know email specifically on an email but you see you write a letter and take that letter and put a stamp on the letter and mail it to their box maybe they live with you at home mail it to them at their home address and they will get that letter what a letter whoever sent letters anymore open that letter dear son Dear John brother Ram brother Sam was talking about John and Mary lesson well my grandfather's name is John and my mother's name was Mary so he was talking about my grandma my grandfather C but that's personal to them and they say now that this is just you know people who are observant of these things of cultures they say the average person if they get a personal letter they will take that letter and they will read it at least three or four times when they get it because first of all they're astounded they got a letter a hand written letter and they'll read it three or four times and they'll think about it and they'll put it away and they say during the week they'll go back and read it maybe two or three times again it's a treasure to them somebody has taken not just somebody ripped out an email somebody took the time got a piece of paper and a pen and thought about what they were going to write and they rode it and they folded it and they put it into an envelope and they put a stamp on it and maybe they put on on the back SWA K seal with the kiss maybe to your son to your daughter to your loved one sealed with a kiss a holy kiss a desire that they can receive what you have freely you have received freely give now the denominational Church they say you are a blessing bless God you got a tie then God will send you back a double fold triple fold tenfold friends as demons it's deemed brother branham said demons have invaded the pulpit satan's agents some of them with churches 10,000 20,000 some of them with viewing audience millions of people I'm sure that many of you who've been around for a while you remember the name Kenneth Copeland remember that name well a while ago took a trip to the Vatican he and James Robison used to be a great Baptist evangelist said he got filled with the holy go to her church in Orlando Florida when he got filled with the Holy Ghost and so now they've gone to the Vatican and they come back and and my friend who is he just got out of jail about seven months ago and he had gone to oru been to Kenneth Kenneth Hagins Rhema Bible School but he got into high finance got in some trouble had to go to jail for a little while found the message in jail while he's being transported from Florida to Oregon he asked the guard he have a library here yeah we got thousands of book go go and look finds a church age book thousands of books picks out a church he reads it all the way from Florida to Oregon and then he gets to the it's a prison camp like a does have any bars or and like one of those Club fed you know and so he goes there and here it is here's the brother branham's library that voice of God has sent into the prison because there was another inmate there who you know who wanted the message and so he's just read a church age book and his mind is spinning because he's got all are you and he's got Kenneth Hagin he's got all that you know that that theology in him and and now he's read the church age book and he says well who reads all this stuff he saw that guy over there so he and his brother in church they become cellmates for nine months this brother gets out and he's been out for seven months and all these people that he's known for many years he gets them on the phone every morning 6:20 a.m. from six twenty seven twenty it's called Eagle Fellowship it's a conference call you dial in the phone number you put the pin code in everybody's connected so for the last two months they've been going through the church age book they read eight to ten pages a day and then they have a question what did you learn what spoke to you so now they've gone through it twice they just finished two weeks ago so now their question and every Friday I I have a session with them I do a Bible study with them and so last week they asked a question well we know who the first six messengers are you know we know because we've read the church but who is the seventh messenger you talked about he walking around he fertilized their brain church age book fertilize their brain now they want to know who's the seventh church age messenger so that's the lesson for this next Friday coming up so I appreciate if you if you would pray that God will open there but anyways he sends me this video and you know because he knew Kenneth Copeland and Kenneth Copeland he gets up on the stage it's an email he sent me and I'm watching this about a ten minute video he gets up there bless God praise God got a great announcement for you you're gonna want to hear this one bless God you know walks around there you know real proud he said I'll tell you just come from the Vatican had dinner with the Pope had a special meeting cleared his calendar all day bless God he talked about how wonderful it was and he said now I gotta tell you I'm making the announcement today the protest is over we've been protesting for five hundred years and it's over we've been Protestants for five hundred years God don't like protester protesters is negative we're all one again you want to talk about prophecy becoming history right before your eyes brother Brent you're always looking back or looking forward buddy knowing what's happening right before you now he drank the kool-aid Newt Gingrich drank the kool-aid how many other people drank the kool-aid how many how many millions were tuned in when they were announced the protest is over well for most of the people didn't even know what the protest was all about anyways they don't know anything about foxes Book of Martyrs they didn't know anything about the the dark the Dark Ages the Inquisition period the people ripped apart dragged through the street didn't know anything about that well I'm a cat I'm a Baptist why are you a problem I don't know I'm just a Protestant why you demo we were all been Democrats in our family all who's been for a hundred years been Democrats the people it's tradition Richard that is blind the people blinded the people's eyes but our eyes should be wider open now than they've ever been before uh you know i-i've known about this message since 83 but I want my last home stretch I want that to be the best part of my Christian life I want to read more I want to listen more I want to study more I want to witness more I want to be more sensitive more aware of the great treasure that has been given to me that great white said that the the the rich young ruler a great privilege asked the right question what must I do to inherit eternal life so Jesus just looked at him discerned his life he saw well money is gonna become the god of the the rich young ruler he says well if you want if you want to have eternal life here's what you got to do go rich young ruler sell everything that you have and give it to the poor and come follow me come and be my disciple the greatest invitation of all time we can look back and see it was a great invitation for the rich young ruler but how about your invitation how about when God knocked at your door rang your doorbell we know how the rich young ruler responded he walked away very sad because he had great possessions I always say the preaching of the gospel is either gonna make you mad glad or sad one or the other and for him it made him very sad and he walked away now we see a by a prophet sighs we see him later well my barns are filled I'm increased with Goods I have need of nothing I'm gonna take it easy maybe go to Palm Springs or maybe go you know somewhere warm on a beach somewhere maybe and then the word come said thou fool this day thy soul is required of thee and then we see his end he's in torment and he looks up and he sees a bur God allowed him from his place to see Abraham now Jesus you know he's seeing all this an divisional II that vision is normal for he's just looking through the tunnel of time while he's talking of giving this this lesson and he cries out father Abraham now think about this he's still trying to maintain his testimony he's in hell and he's calling father Abraham and he asked him let Lazarus come and and and drop a couple of drops of water in my top I'm paraphrasing hey bruh no no can do hey you had everything he had nothing well I used to feed him the crumbs from my table sure he said beside that there is a great gulf fixed he can't come here you can't go there so now he says well if that's the case here's my plan let there be a great evangelistic crusade be it be formed and take that crusade and go to my brothers and preach to them and warn them that they don't come to this wicked place where I am Abraham said nope they have they have the law they have Moses the prophets and if one rose from the dead they still would not believe now friends this word in our day in our lives this word has risen it's become a brand new book brother Sam would say when those seals were open we talked about it yesterday brother Brown this whole Bible became a brand new book go gave us supernatural goggles to be able to look at it be able to see brother Branham says I'm a typology and any man who truly understands the Bible will be a typology I can tell you I graduated from Bible School I didn't know what a type was I didn't know what a shadow was they taught us hermeneutics homiletics how to how to get a subject how to put a title on it how to get an introduction how to get point one point two point three have a couple illustration and then close and then pull that's what that's what all theology schools teach and so the great white throne judgment is waiting for many people and brother Branham says that when when when they are there what a picture he paints now I want to just remind you that the subject that I took this morning was invasion insanity deliverance so the world has been invaded has been invaded for a long time but when the seals were open it was a super invasion because there was a whole bunch more million demons that were unleashed these were extra demons that were not in the world before and their target is you and me that's why we have to have the whole armour of God on every day you may think well I'm nothing I'm well really we are nothing in ourselves but with God in you you have a treasure in earthen vessels you're carrying that seed you're carry eternal life got the token walking down the street got the token got the token and me got eternal life in me and you got to talk with one one time there was a fellow who talked to himself and they said why do you talk to yourself all the time he said well he had two reasons number one I like to talk to intelligent people and number two I like to hear what intelligent people have to say and so you know what I talked to myself and you know what I talk I remind myself of the scriptures I remind myself of the church age of the seals of the future home of heavenly bride and bridegroom and I also think about the great white throne judgment brother Branham says when they come there their whole life will flash before them in an instant everything they ever said everything they ever did everything they ever thought and brother Branham says you think your thoughts are private no he said every motive for everything you said or did or thought will be flashed people think television is a great thing I believe in television I believe God sent a prophet to television and he told that vision to me and it's precious to me and you know like like brother Branham was saying in that invasion he was saying Lord you know humbled me mold me break me and he people tried to make him something you know I'm your brother don't do that you're making the Antichrist so and so so here's a prophet of God here he's he's laying on his bed well if I'm ever gonna do anything for God Betty he's millions of souls have been preached the gospel untold numbers of healings I mean brother Tim Dodds a minister in our church he's just want to drop this in for you he his mom and dad were both healed and brother branham's meetings up in northern Canada he said when they are in a meeting brother Branham was there and to blind people were there and and and one was a man one was a woman brother Ram prayed for both of them told them the goal and belief the man was healed the woman was not healed later on she wrote a letter the brother branham their brother branham you know explained the whole situation was in that meeting and myself another blind man and he was healed and I wasn't healed she said why didn't I get my healing she got the letter back somebody had to read it to her and it was a believer who read it to her and a believer who shared the story brother Branham wrote back said the reason you were not healed is because you did not want to give up your blind pension and you love the tenshun you are getting for being blind let that one roll around in your mind for a moment brother Bram talks about motive objective for everything you said everything you did everything you ever thought we serve awesome God friends that got I try to talk to people about about predestination and foreigner like brother ran said well that that's a bad word in some circles I can talk to me I said do you believe God knows how many hairs are on my headset it yep do you believe God will know how many hairs I have in my head next week yeah how about next month and I just kind of I said well I said if God knows all that how can he not know what choices I'm going to make and where I'm going to be next week and where I'm going to be at the end of my life and what choices I'm going to be and what choices you're going to make so I said no your church they used to teach you know and a lot of them did teach predestined I said they used to teach they used to preach holiness so let me ask you a question did they start wrong or are they finishing wrong one of the other see sometime sometimes you got to walk around and somebody's brain walk around fertilize your brain and that's the question has to come an answer and you know what most of them have no answer oh I don't know oh I I just believe my past I just believe my church that's the defense mechanism sorry they didn't get what I got out of the Bible out of the word and so here that that that we have we've come to a point lots of us we had to be like Samson we had to be stripped down and then you know sometimes the Lord one more time just one more time I think about that story brother Wade and how those those people they found out what his his secret of his strength was and they finally cut his hair off and they had him out there in the grinding wheel and he's just running around just grinding and all all the people brother Brown said the name of Samson it used to make them fish speaking his made them tremble here's the guy little little guy took the whole gates of the city on his shoulders and so they knew that now they had him blinded rope tied down grinding and they're laughing and cheering a little more hair grow back you know what happened he grind a little bit faster they said hey our economy is gonna go up our enemy now he's grinding faster more production here so he started grinding faster and he reached back there if that was me and I was one of those Philistine kings that guy would have got he would have got his head shaved seven times a day there would not it would not have been a chance a piece of peach fuzz would ever grow up on his head but he said Lord just one more time and you know there's gonna be a lot of Samson's in this world they're gonna be at a place where they you know they they they ran after other things they were warned by God but they had to have it he had to have that Jezebel I thought what do you think he was thinking about when he was grinding here oh that that Bob heard that Jezebel why do I listen to her oh he probably had a lot of thoughts going through his mind I'm sorry July Longview Jezebel well they're probably twin sisters you know probably cut yeah same DNA so anyways you know so now one more time Lord and God used him and in the end of his life he was more productive than he ever was all through his life and I believe there's going to be people on the homestretch you're gonna be more fervent you're gonna have more of a desire you're gonna have more intensity you're gonna be more awareness you're gonna be super sensitive to the supernatural which is where we need to be we were trained for this friends it's like you know you you we talked about my brother was in the Navy he was in the Navy SEAL team and what you you you are in you are in the SEAL team you're in the green beret you're in the Special Forces you're in the Royal Rangers of the message don't ever let anybody tell you you're nothing don't anybody ever try to strip you of your supernatural dignity friends you stand I'm not talking about standing with your head high in pride I'm talking about standing with your head high because I'm a son of God like that that man who was kidnapped and brought to another place and his character the way he held themselves he said in another land my father is a king in another land friends in another land it's just beyond this veil my father is that king and your father is is that king and so so now let me just bring it down to to a close so we see the invasion we see the invasion has caused mass insanity insanity on steroids and you see all the things that are happening in the news sports politics business music you see all the insanity taking place it's insanity on steroids you see this me to movement come on well a man 30 years ago he brushed up against me and I just want to report it now it happened 30 years ago but I'm just telling it now it's the me to movement or the time's up movement you know what friends you think that you think they've got traction you say well they haven't scratched us that you haven't even felt the itch to where they're going with those nails nobody I mean I would hate to think if somebody went back in my life to when I was a teenager I mean that would be dangerous you know I don't want to get into that but I mean it was a crazy world back then and now who is going to try to put themselves out for public public office or spotlight when you're going to be barbecued you're going to be torn and and shredded your life will be shredded your wife will be shredded your children will be shredded and people sit there with ice water in their veins don't care a bit all I care about is we get elected we want power that's all we care if we got a sacrifice once so be it we got to sacrifice a hundred so be it thousand it's been like that all through history friends people who had power did not care if they had to imprison a million slaves so their economy could grow didn't matter and I'll tell your friends has gone on all this issue did all the stuff that's going on people trying to crash our border it's human trafficking on an elevated scale people are paying ten twenty thousand dollars a piece to get over cross the border and not only our border but they're coming from Africa they're coming from China people are paying $20,000 to $30,000 and when they're eight months pregnant they get a visa to come to America and they pop out the baby and the baby's a citizen and they pay twenty or thirty thousand dollars it's called the maternity tourist they come here they plant their child they got the the citizenship and they go back to China but my son's a citizen of the US and chain migration I'll get into I know one Indian family fifty-five of his family have come in on chain migration because he got in and he opened up a motel and he needed employees and he could have employees and because there were family he didn't have to pay a minimum wage and they were so happy to get out of India and get to the promised land they were furred all just just give me a place to lay down just give me some rice every day I'm happy the world the world has gone so far beyond what we would considered crazy and yet God has God just like Satan went into the ether into the garden and deceived Eve God has snuck in the Satan's Eden and he has come and he snatched his bride in the darkest in the most wicked in the most vile in the most insane age and insanity on steroids God has brought deliverance to his bride and so now where are we now what what is God revealed to us what do we know you know you think about what's in your just try to do inventory and I've done inventory sometimes in business hard work it's tedious work sometimes try to do inventory what do you know what is God revealed to you you are a walking talking supernatural encyclopedia walking down the road and nobody know you that you just pass by people nobody know well there's a a son of God there's a daughter of God oh well I wish I knew would know yeah they don't know brother branham said when Jesus was here 1% of the people knew Jesus was here he said in our day now listen to this this base son you got to go back and search your brother sounds right here brother branham said in our day it will be 1/100 of 1% who will be able to receive the message now if that doesn't make you the elite of God by the grace of God I don't know what does and often times I think a lot of times I'm flying and I'm traveling and I'm really I'm thankful that I am able to travel again and you know God has done such a miraculous work he has done I want the 15 different medical practitioner everything from my family doctor chiropractic naturopathic acupuncture acupressure and everything and all I said well what's wrong they said well the nerves you got neuropathy neuro means nerves and pathway means sick it's sick nerves your your nerve endings are misfiring and they said we hold your feet and and I hold your feet in my head your feet are warm but your brain is telling your feet are ice-cold I woke up felt like I had two ice cubes at the end of my feet I walked I felt like I was walking on pins and needles my feet wouldn't know I couldn't feel I was tripping over myself and all the doc I was desperate friends I was desperate wanted to know of some answer wanted to find somebody who could give me you know they all said no it's impossible those nerves can't regenerate I'm sure sister Rebeka can tell you probably they told the same thing to brother Gary and thank God for brother Gary and sister Rebecca the brother Gary went to the pain clinic and he told me about the prescription today and that was the thing that gave me a little bit of relief and it helped me to have faith help me to believe every step along the way now God has totally regenerated every nerve in my feet except for my big toe and my big toes are not not healed yet and I believe that God just left them there for a while to remind me of what he's done oh what a great every time I have to look down so well I ain't I ain't what I'm want them to be I ain't what they're gonna be but I'm sure glad they ain't what they used to be so I think oftentimes what has God revealed to us you know I'm just gonna be done in just two minutes so just just hold on and I thought once I was flying in a plane and I said you know what has God revealed in the message to me that I didn't know before I came to the message and so it's like brother Branham had the things that God said pick up your pen and write so I picked up my pen on the plane and I wrote I said if this message had not come to me I would not know that it had never rained before Noah's day it was 120 years built in the ark I wouldn't know that I wouldn't know that Abraham and Sarah would change back to a young man a young I'm reading the exactly what I wrote down I wouldn't know that King Saul was saved I wouldn't know the rich young ruler ultimate end was hell I wouldn't know the Enoch built the pyramids I wouldn't know the truth about baptism and Godhead wouldn't know the initial evidence was not speaking in tongues I wouldn't know the truth about the rapture and the changing wouldn't know who the two witnesses were wouldn't know who the 144,000 wouldn't know who the souls under the altar that's the big that took me about five minutes then I would I wouldn't know the revelation of the church age of the seven seals I wouldn't know the serpent seed that Cain and Abel were twins I wouldn't be able to measure the future home of the of the heavenly bride and bridegroom I wouldn't know the Antichrist the false prophet and the beast it was just three stages of Satan's rule I wouldn't know about the the harlot the number of the Beast the name of the Beast the mark of the beast the image of the Beast I wouldn't know about the seven dimension I wouldn't know about adoption predestination statue of a perfect man marriage and divorce anointed ones at the end time Satan's Eden godless evil age as a very religious doing God a service without a being his will the supernatural and the third pull after I read that I said that's a lot and you know what you know that or if you don't know it it's available to you to know it to dig it out every one of those truths is a treasure remember we talked about a mystic a myth but the rest is the mystical bride of Jesus Christ and a mystic is one who seeks after and attains direct intercourse with God what's he gonna say to the ones that come before him depart from me you workers of iniquity I never knew you I never became intimate with you you never became pregnant with my word it's awesome awesome treasure awesome privilege that God so now I'm thinking well as a result of that what what has God made the bride this took a little bit of time only take me two minutes but as a result of that first of all we realize that we truly are new creatures in Christ not not a patched up job but a brand-new unit we are the happiest people on earth where the attributes of God thoughts of God offspring of God genes of God's sperm of God we are God's victory over Satan and this generation we are overcomers of the name the number of the mark the image the Beast the the harlots deceptions sin and the world we are a new species of a supernatural divine order we are sons and daughters of the king mystics and a mystical body the elite of God the super church the super race we are unshakable indestructible unmovable courageous bold brave and committed just quoting what the Prophet said now we are biologically a unique creation we have God's DNA inside of us we are nursing from the breasts of el-shaddai I wear a colony from heaven we're a community of believers aliens pilgrims and strangers we are the revival we are the prisoners of love of Christ the word and the message we're the happiest prisoners on the face of the earth we are super sensitive supernatural we are the most contagious people on the face of the earth the most spontaneous people on the face of the earth we are a product of divine supernatural engineer a product of spiritual evolution we are seated and Krait with Christ in heavenly places a part of a divine Lissa a divine spiritual supernatural aristocracy other why America is so infatuated with the so called royal family over there on the other side of the imposters impersonators on the royal family you're the royal family you're part of a divine spiritual supernatural aristocracy but her brother Bram say when the bride fully realizes who she is and comes to maturity rapture we're talking brother Sam brother Sam see God's waiting on us he's waiting on her I hope he's not waiting on me I would not want to be the one to hold up the progress I hope you're not there's gonna be those who are left behind friends they're still virgin but they're foolish virgins brother branham said that maybe the people who walked in all the light they had or maybe they never had a chance to see the message and yet they're true and heart and God knows their heart maybe they gave a cup of water to the bride maybe they were good to the bride that's in God that's in God's I can't judge anybody only god can judge those people but he will righteous judgment and in his eyes if somebody did something for you that may have been their ticket into eternity not as a bride friends we have the seed of perfect love just the last page now we have the seed of perfect faith we have God's supernatural strength and stamina in us we have received a divine blood transfusion a heart transplant a mind transplant a life transplant we have the ability to prosper and thrive in the realms of the supernatural we have a supernatural marching order we have a passion to know and serve God a magnificent obsession to know Christ and we have a supernatural Passport let's stand to our feet friends I wonder I wonder I had a while ago you know I hadn't been traveling for while and my passport expired and I had to go through the whole process go down get my picture taken take it down to the post office send away and they send me a brand new passport all ready to go I wonder how about your passport how about your supernatural passport if the rapture were to happen maybe after we go to the dedication service of the house the home have some fun if the rapture happened tonight where would you be tomorrow hopefully there would be no tomorrow for you because you'd be in another realm but how many that we rub shoulders with how many that are in the body of Christ around the world how many if the rapture happened today they would be in the tribulation and you know what they would be they would be just as desperate as those people who are in Hell crawling and screaming at each other just one another chance they want another Church of salvation the foolish virgins maybe if they knew about this message or it heard about the message but had you know maybe they were on the fence about it and they find out it was true they would be grasping if I only had one more chance to be part of God's supernatural bride don't take it for granted friends don't ever let it become common let's bow our heads father we know that a lot of people they have a lot of wise wh-why why and brother Branham preached about wise why this why that why little Bethlehem why it had to be a and the wise in this day they will understand all the wise we are wide W is e and we understand the wh-why s because the prophet has told us why it had to be shepherds why little Bethlehem and so tonight hopefully we're speaking in a language that is going to encourage you to cash in on your supernatural beneficiary policy the divine promises that are left in this word I trust that you'd be able to write your check whatever God has promised in the word whether Branham said he's a great high priest sitting at the right hand of majesty waiting to make good any one of the redemptive blessings he's waiting brother Branham says he can't even go to work on your case whether it's salvation healing to liquid he can't even go to work on your case until we confess it and literally this this is really going out on a limb friends but we literally buy our faith and buy our profession we literally put God into motion on our behalf on our need like I said that's stretching if I'm wrong brother Sam can correct me but I believe that to be true God has gone to work on my case so many - and he's able to go to work on everybody's case simultaneously around the world able to hear and answer every prayer around the world so don't ever think God is too busy to hear your prayer or to answer your prayer father we thank you for this great opportunity thank you for brother Sam and for having the confidence to have me come and speak and I know he does not take that lightly and I don't take this privilege lightly I pray father that you would take the words that were spoken that you would anoint them afresh and anew in the hearts of your children and let them walk out from this building tonight saying it was good to have been in the house of God God heard me God heard maybe maybe God answered a need that I did
