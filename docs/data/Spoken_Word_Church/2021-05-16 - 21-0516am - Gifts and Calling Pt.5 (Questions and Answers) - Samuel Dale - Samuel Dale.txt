i'll pick the thought and just move on over whatever you you decide so you you write your questions down we'll get it asked around and have questions and answers amen now sister esther wants to meet with the sisters of the church after the evening service to get everything kind of lined up of where you're traveling what you're doing what's going on you know for the the ladies uh week out as we'd call it and off but uh so just to do that all right uh brother bob is up preaching that brother uh up at blue ridge preaching this stuff this day so remember them and then remember the lord willing this coming wednesday brother aaron will be ministering unto us the word of the lord so keep these things in mind you know we uh kind of changed things around and got it in a sunday school and it worked real good so we'll we'll have a good time in doing that way we can all have a sunday school time and a a you know a time of doing it so we just have to move things a little bit change things a little bit uh you know maybe uh put this over here instead of that and that's that the other we'll try to have like uh if you have any comments any things any uh testimonies or something uh let terrence know because that way we'll move it over in the afternoon we have the testimony service in the afternoon cutting out the time of the morning we'll we'll do that we'll move it into the afternoon or the wednesday night service so remember that was okay um is that all of the announcements let's see uh yeah the men will be meeting pretty quick to get together about uh their trip and also we we we want you to enjoy uh you know having your little bit of time together uh in your meetings and things and and i certainly enjoy it i enjoy the the time together with the brothers to to get together and the kids to play and and and us grown-ups just sit around and talk and just have us a good time you know and we have a good time fellowshipping together and we appreciate it and all like that amen father we thank you for your grace and your love we thank you for everything we just ask you now that you'd be with us in the service today and that your light and your love would be with each and every one of us and that your grace we know is truly sufficient for every need so we pray that you would bless each one remember the sick among us remember those that are not here today because of the sicknesses and the things and we pray that you would just bless and guide each one we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen ephesians 1 we'll start with verse 3. blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ and once according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy without blame before him in love what now having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will and what is his will is his word you may be seated the lord that is blessing to the reading of the word amen now i'll just review just a little bit if you have questions then we can get a microphone and run back and let you uh give your questions and things and feel free to to question about anything in the uh point of what we've been talking about uh which has really been talking on predestination all right uh we kind of brought it to a close there the other night most of the services and things are last sunday to uh to talk about the uh the point of predestination and how do we believe predestination this slight review to where do what we do predestination well this is predetermined it's going to happen well now god doesn't predetermine by his desires because he desired it all be saved he doesn't predetermine by his own will or want to because that would pull over into the he predestinates really by your desire he predetermines by your desire because your desire will will move over into your life and you'll live that way and be guided in that form so we pre we believe in predestination which is destiny set beforehand all right but how is it done it's done by for knowledge god foreknew all things all right so then there's nothing we can pull over on him there's thoughts that you're having in your mind right now god before the world ever begun had that he knew that so just don't try to say what i you know i don't know i just don't don't think wrong because if you think wrong then remember your thoughts in heaven are louder than your voice on earth so that's going to to change it and make it make it all work uh to that point but to think about predestination a destiny is determined forever being in the world all right see that's why we don't just cover predestination for uh uh bribe people we have to get into deeper thoughts and meanings in that way but we go by predestination for all people everybody is predestinated what by god's foreknowledge all right that's that simple see god's foreknowledge allowed him to be able to set back there and look down through time and see the beginning but also he could follow all the way through with that same thought and see the ending of all things that's right so that's predestination that's destiny determined all right see then actually we're making our own destiny amen because it's not according to his desires it's according to our desire amen we desire to serve him god knew before the world ever begun that some people would want to be saved and some wouldn't right that's right see he's not setting a stamp on something and saying well this is the way it is this is the way you're going to be you're going to do no just remember it's all based upon what you're believing what your thoughts are what you're determining all right so we actually brother tom fathers had a good way of saying it was a good thought see we actually trigger our predestination in other words our destiny of where we're going is some way back here in life set in an order to where that will reach that point when we get there all right and see then it's all in us it's not in him all right man that's right see that's where the people of the message or they want all of these great thoughts and all like that and that's fine the prophet said he said you always was eternal amen i believe those things but just remember what was he talking about if you have eternal life amen that's as simple as can be if you have eternal life today if you have received the baptism of the holy ghost the new birth eternal life then that eternal life that you have always was eternal amen well see remember then it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from god because it's according to our desire it's not that but it's it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally but it's the what the word our seed and there's a seed predestinated for every age there was people forever age upon the earth it's all set yeah why because he looked down and saw it right you say yeah but i didn't choose him he chose me well that's all right we'll get back to some of those thoughts and we'll pick up a few little points along the way you know but to think about it you say but but brother dale i sought him i cried i prayed that's good i believe that i don't believe the prophet was cutting it out when he said you didn't seek god or the bible saying that you didn't seek god he's showing us the point of what we was doing seeing our life we were seeking god trying to find god right he said well i wasn't trying to find him no but that's not what i'm getting at see it was him trying to find us he said adam where aren't they and see adam then had something to do with it right he had a choice that he had to make yep that's right and see then you're you're choosing it's based upon you on the basis of receiving it but it's receiving something that's already paid for it was already finished our salvation was set and sealed before the foundation world because he was looking at it as for what he saw then that way the thing can't say why did you do that like this you know you can't say to god but god you didn't give me a choice you you set my choice you you you no no he gave you a choice he gave you a choice see that's why it takes all of the word of god amen now i'm saying that with all that i can get with all of the word of god to come out to the correct answer of doctrines and ideas because if not you're going to say well i've got this quote yep that's right well all right he said that he said you always was eternal sure but we don't read the rest of the quote if you have eternal life he's explaining eternal life as being the person of jesus christ coming and living in us in the baptism of the holy ghost all right see then that way we have to we don't have to worry about it and try to figure out what i i just i just really don't know whether i'm called or not well you're just playing your own game and really crucifying your own self because you're not taking what he says he said jacob have i loved he saw how i hated it all right now did he hate esau with a word of hate that we call it now we've been through that right it wasn't the word hate thou or despising of it it was esau's ways that god hated amen he loved he loved jacob's ways and jacob's ways is hard for us to love sometimes because he was a shyster that's what the word mean tripper upper shyster he he you know well yet he loved god amen why did we cover through there for services and things why did god choose abraham because abraham he knew what abraham would do he knew as the prophet said that abraham would he teach his children the way of truth that's right then he knows whether or not you will see then let's make our calling and election sure then what do we believe god did not predestinate by his desires he predestinated by his that's right his foreknowledge lets him see what we will all do amen then he sees our choice amen he said well you just said i didn't choose him no you've got to accept the choice he can stand before you every day of your life and hold the word of god out in front of you unless you receive that as a as for you a pardon is not a pardon unless received as one unless you accept that amen that's right well then that's that's not destroying the rest word that you didn't seek him no it's explaining it we didn't have anything within us as humanly beings to be able to seek after god we were heathern well yet god put before us the path and give us a choice and then he could predestinate according to the choices we make that's right so don't blame god well now god just like i tell you my my brother's a methodist minister but he believes he said god didn't give me a choice i said yes he did i said he didn't make you what you are you made yourself what you are and he knew exactly what you would be right what you'd do so what is predestination it's a destiny set but it's set before the world because it set the part in the the point of god in his mind amen knew that before the world what choice you would make is that hard to comprehend well see then that way the thing form can't say why did you form it you can't say well god you never gave me a choice he said well look at all the choices again right like the story was told what about the the guy sitting on the top of a building you know her house and the water coming higher and higher and you know he kept praying lord send me help send me help and boat come by and he said no i don't want to get in that boat this happened and that happened i don't want to well when it was all finished and he died and went up to glory it's just a story for telling he said i sent you a boat i sent you a lot of ways for you to get out of the trouble you're then but you wouldn't do it so you chose your own self you can't blame god for the choices you make that's right amen you had a choice to marry a wife you had a choice to marry you know to have a husband or whatever you had a choice right well then you have a choice in christianity you can accept what he has done for you or reject what he has done amen but remember the point is he knew the choice amen i remember in in the baptists they used to say that uh you know that ark that that noah belt said uh it was big enough to carry everybody that was in the world and i used to tell them then i said i thought it was if the bible says as it was so is it i thought that was pretty close to billions of people that was in the world at the time noah because it would mean as it was so is it now you know and see you say well well what was the choice noah built an ark no i said well i don't know what's going on but i'm going to build an ark well see he proved his predestination by what he done you and i prove what we're doing by the life we live that way you can't blame god for you well i i i was just i i wasn't given a chance like everybody else i was born poor and and and things like i wasn't given a choice predestination don't have anything to do with how how much money you got in your pocket that doesn't you you can't blame god for things not happening the way you want to when you're too lazy to get up and go to work sorry but that's plain language but it's true that's right he said well god didn't give me a chance he gave this bird no here look at how they made millions of dollars if you've gotta went to work you could have made more than that i was standing up in jamaica one time first time i was over there little brother reed had told me he said well you know these people over here said they're a little different brother they'll i said little different nothing i said a lot of you say you ain't got no you're poor people you're just that the other i said if you get up and go to work well they didn't like that because you see that was their pity party they didn't have nothing to do i said get you because i seen them walking around when i've seen what they do i'll get you a machete and go down here and cut grass alongside the road still pay you but i said you're the one that's doing it you're just too sorry to go to work well it's the same thing to you and me you know what i mean see we make our own choosing that's the whole point that i've tried to get you to see you say yeah but if i make my choosing then god didn't have to do it but if if it was all god i didn't have nothing to do with it see you're trying to to uh backstep around the real truth of any of the whole time you're trying to walk away and try to blame everybody else you're trying to blame god and say well god made me this away god didn't make you that way that's right that's what i told my brother he said how can god judge me for being wrong when he made me wrong i said he didn't make you wrong amen because he made you right and gave you a choice yes then whatever you've done with a choice that's what determines it right because see that's predestination is a destiny set but the way god does it is by his foreknowledge well then that way you can't go over here and say well i didn't have a choice i didn't have an opportunity yes you did that's right you just didn't follow god in his ways that's right we had a choice you got a choice in life you got a choice to marry or not marry got a choice in this work or not work amen and see that's pretty good the way in america now they odd to me they're having to hire people at the mcdonald's and pay them a hundred dollars or 200 just to sign on in some places they said as much as 500 for you to come down and put in for a job that's right well no wonder why go to work when you can draw unemployment we made it like that but see it's our choice no it's our choice of life that god looks at and sees that choice and sees you for what you want to be in your own self but he gave he gives you every opportunity you want to go through the bible with anybody you want to take in the bible and let's just sit down and talk about it he said well he didn't give uh cain a choice yes he did he told cain he said would you not have been accepted had you done like your brother that's right don't talk to me about god not giving you a choice god didn't give me god didn't help me i was raised poor oh poor thing poor you don't like for me to talk do you when i was applying a mule all day long out in the field when i was seven years old that'd be child labor today wouldn't it you know that'd be bad that'd be pitiful they'd like putting their parents up for treating their kids like that but that's the only way we had to make it a living don't talk to me about it that's what you know they'd say they're at work well dale over he's they just wouldn't come over and talk to me about the pity pattern how bad it was and how everything was real i'd start talking about what i used to do and they just walk away and we was poor but see church we lived right and we made it my mother would not accept the things when they first started giving away of the cheese and the milk and the the stuff and all she wouldn't accept it i told her one day i said mom i said i don't know what you're doing but i said look there's nine of us that pays income tax nine kids at that time it was 13 and four died you know i said there's nine kids we pay income tax don't you think that's enough to take care of what little bit you'd draw or what little you'd go get because see she had pride you got a haircut every two or three weeks it didn't make no difference it may look like a bowl set on it and they cut around it and shipped it off it might have done it might look like a lot of things but we got a haircut why because that was pride why has america fallen because she's lost her pride amen that's right but it is not the same thing to say the bride of jesus christ is doing that she's losing her pride he said no no well you tell me where it used to be you know we believe this we believe that now what do we believe that's right and then we try to figure it out and try to blame god well i can i i quote the prophet to you thank god glad you can but you know one of these days that's going to be brought to judgment amen we're going to stand at the judgment seat you say no bro i don't know the bride don't go to the white throne she goes to judgment everybody faces a judgment the bride of jesus christ has a judgment but not a white throne judgment of the decision of eternal life or not no amen because that's not it but it's a judgment seat amen we're going to have to give an account for the things we've done whether good or bad the bible says that's right well i don't know i don't like that with that that well what are you going to do but do you understand amen predestination then to sum it up is the very point of a destiny that god looked down and saw and he could write your name in the book of life or leave it out amen but he would see your choice yes amen he's operating according to you what you choose choose you this day who you'll serve amen it's it's pretty it's not predetermined in the basis that that we don't have anything to do because like i said you've got to accept eternal life yeah but i'll come in the world with it i got the quotes we'll we're going to go to judgment when he dates all those quotes that's right and then we're going to see who's got what yeah that's right right all right it won't be no argument at that day it won't be nothing for lula church to say well i didn't understand they'll say well you remember that old hard-headed guy that preached to you year after year in and out days and weeks and months of trying to get you to see what predestination was and how that you had to make your own choice i'll be glad to stand there that way not to the point of trying to to judge me and you or whatever no but to stand there on the word of god that i've tried my best to preach to you to get you to see what true predestination really is it's god's foreknowledge that's right then you can't blame him for anything amen it would be said then that we have the plan uh because that's what i got just the notes if i do it if you don't uh you know anybody has any questions we'll go with a question but if you don't know this preacher little thought goes with what i'm talking about but you see what i'm i'm trying to get you to see amen he said yeah but brother today brother branham said we didn't choose him he chose us amen but you had to accept the choice that's right right that's right if you did not accept what he had done for you it won't do you no good that's right amen amen so then it's not blaming god right amen well i just wasn't treated right you poor little thing i told them people at work out there and they begin telling me about how bad it was and all you know in their life i said wheeze up before daylight you fed the mule before you ate breakfast because you were going to work him that day you watered the mule before you went to the field when you got through at lunchtime and got back to the house you fed and watered the mule before you went in the house to eat take about an hour you'd go make sure you'd water the mule you'd make sure he's doing okay because you knew he was going to be pulling the plow till dark come down they don't talk to me about bad times or hard times but see i know that we come through that why because we had a determination i told you about my mother whipping my brother with a metal ring off of a wooden barrel when he was 18 years old oh but now wait just a minute now i'm out from under my mama i'm 15 16. she ain't trying to write no no no no when you get 15 16 you got no sense to know what they're hammering on you is beating on his doing that's right you know what it was doing before then he was planning on leaving home she said you go back in the house and wait and you get down and get out of your mat spell then you can leave he went back in the house and said i don't know he never did leave home because he knew she was right and what she's doing see god sometimes has to whip his children my point he has to whip his children a lot of times to get us to line up and understand what's going on it's not no petty pat or little baby thing sometimes it's pretty hard on us being a christian is not a soft thing it's a wonderful thing to realize the end of all things when it finishes up and we get to enjoy the pleasures of eternity do you understand what i'm talking about now so anybody got a question anybody got a point on predestination on for knowledge on anything anybody got a point on question or comment well i guess either i preached it hard enough to where you'd understand what i'm talking about because that's what i've tried my best to do it's preached for you to see what it's all about the truth of it well no brother dale i just don't want to talk to you you won't listen to me you ever thought about it might not be you listening might not be me listening it might be god i ain't going to listen to our flim flam playing footy ideas or thoughts no i'm not i'm trying to be a human i try to be right i try to be a christian try to walk as one to be a pastor to try to help people and to do everything i could but i also know that you've got a choice you've got to make and you make your choice you make your calling an election sure you get everything right in the right order it'll come out to the right okay all right now think about it then if we're not no questions maybe i can create a question but think about it oh got a question okay okay wait wait we get the we want everybody else to hear you um i just wanted to know if you would elaborate a little bit more on the judgment you said the bride will go before i don't remember anything about that okay according to the bible now we as the bride of jesus christ number one nail it down the bride of jesus christ does not go to the white throne judgment because you have eternal life what would you be judged on the basis of that all right so you don't have to worry about losing eternal life and going to hell or anything like if you're born again if you're truly born again everything's already settled in that basis and it'll be okay but the bible says that we all must stand before the judgment seat of christ all right now that is not the white throne the white throne it will be no no uh it won't be no jesus christ standing at the white throne to plead your case if you're at the white throne you you're at the mercy of the of the point of heaven who's talking to you and and you can't say well now jesus i've got this quote where brother around and said this man walks out over here and takes my place he's not talking about the decision of eternal life that's right romans 14 romans 14 10. all right right we must all stand we must all give an account well what am i going to be judged for for the things done in the body whether they're good or bad that i didn't get rid of that i didn't listen to the preacher that was hollering at me and trying to tell me everything what we're supposed to be doing i didn't do that so i've got to give an account not a decision of eternal life get it right now there's no such thing as the bride of christ going before the white throne judgment but we almost stand a judgment well what am i going to the things that we do that we don't repent of whoa no no get it right the white throne the bride does not stand before the white throne judgment but she stands before a judgment seat that even we'll judge angels the bible says all right suppose i do something to brother donnie i've explained this over and over and i i know how the human element works when i first do it i want to repent don't you i want to get rid of it but you know i let that go for a day or two and it just gets a little bit less problem until you know what happens now i'm explaining myself so you can listen you know what ends up happening i start blaming him for it right instead of my problem that i should be going to him to repent of what i'm doing i start blaming him and say he ought to come to me he doesn't mean he's done me wrong i'm just telling you what human beings will do and why we have to stand before the judgment seat of christ is because we will not straighten up something goes wrong we want to bypass it right we want to blame everybody else for our problems am i right no no no i've tried brother dale i i i've repented of godly sorrow is what worketh repentance according to the bible if you don't repent of your of something that you do wrong you're going to answer but now you're making it on whether or not i do anything no the bride does not go before the white throne judgment she does she will actually be sitting on the white throne judgment to judge others and will judge angels and everything she will be sitting beside of jesus christ and doing the judgment all right let's solve that enough all right but you say well what would it be the little things that we don't do go over there in galatians where talks about the the fruits of the spirit it talks about fruits of the spirit and then it talks about works of the flesh brother branham was was telling him about a little girl one day and he said she done this so and so way back a long time ago and said god's holding that against her see if we don't repent being a christian doesn't make you to the point that you don't have to repent being a christian should make us to the point we ought to want to repent more daily more and more ever we ought to repent every moment we ought to cry out all the time god forgive me help me but it's the little things is that what the bible says the little foxes is what falls the vines so you see there'd be things in our life that we don't think that we owe it like i said you tell me that i'm wrong i'll argue either to and we won't talk about going home we'll be here month after month because i ain't going to break down on that one thing i'm a human being and i've done it and i know you have that when it first starts i've done the dirty brother donny's no problem but after a while if i don't get that right attitude within myself i'll start blaming him i'll start putting it on him and after a while i'll have it so justified until i didn't even do nothing wrong i'm a sweet goody good he ordered he ought to thank me for that am right am i right am i am i telling it the way that it is that it's the little things it's not something that's a decision of eternal life or not that's settled by the new birth you're not being judged there for whether or not to go to heaven it's a judgment and i can't explain that to totally i've been asked where would that take place i don't know i don't know the placing of it i just know that the bible says it and the prophet said it that you're going to give an account right well i thought i was born again i thought the born-again spirit took care of everything yeah that's like one brother used to preach here with me years ago and i tried my for over and over and over to try to get him to see but he said if you're born again said it takes care of all your marital problems he did he tried to teach it right here he said that takes care of all of your marital problems and everything i said no sir i said the new birth does not take care of your marital problem that would make adulteries and stuff like that being in the wrong place that's why we got to keep a clean slate right why would it not why would a christian not want to have a clean slate that's my point that's my point the whole point of all of the things of saying it why would i not want a cleanse flight well i don't want people to know that i'd i've done that well i certainly dread to get rid of it here than to stand there before the ones i've done it with do you understand do you understand if we're going to sit at a judgment seat if there's going to be a judgment seat somebody's going to sit on the seat and judge and somebody's going to be standing in front of being judged now not to decide whether or not you're going to eternal life no way no that's where they put it we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that everyone may receive the things done in his done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad well i i felt being a christian took care of all sin the bible says and the prophet says that the bride is the only one that can sin where have you been that's been taught to you from this pulpit right here for 50 years come on where's it at where's this great thing that we call it christianity but yet we can go out and live like the devil and say well that wasn't me that was that was my old body that done that i wasn't guilty and next week i'll do it again now yeah why don't you go down and pay the pope and you don't you don't have to fool running around so much you what do you mean brother i mean if if you can get by with it by just a confession of of a point or even not a confession then go pay the pope they believe that i don't that's right i don't believe that'll take care of our problems i believe we're going to give it a given account for what we do in this world right if i lie to you then what would it be if i steal from you what would it be yeah but i'm a christian i don't do well why don't you do it now you're saying you're a christian and you will happen to one day have to admit it maybe you won't hear but one day you'll have to admit that you was wrong right do you understand what i'm saying somewhere are you going to have to admit you was wrong all right i never heard christianity explain like that will you explain it you mean you got a right to just go out and sin only christians have sins right a sinner's condemned on a higher level he's condemned for being this sin but the christian is condemned for the sins we do the little little bitty things the little bitty foxes the little bitty points that we do the little lies we tell what about it the judgment of the deeds whether good or bad so evidently if you're going to be judged according to your deeds whether good or bad they must be a reward or a removing of a reward okay now look don't worry about it you're not going to stand there and be judged and lose your eternal life no no no now don't go running out in your mind you stand before the white throne judgment just remember only the sinners stand before this white throne judgment the bride don't stand before the white throne judgment she sets on the judgment with him judging others all right what about it what's your thoughts on that well brother there are you just making it worth it don't look like there's any hopes for any of us no i'm just trying to tell you what the bible says don't think you can go out and live like the devil and get by with it yeah but i've been a christian i've been i've been a preacher i've been this man i've you understand bride does not stand before the watch on judgment bride does not lose eternal life nowhere and to be cast into hell those that are cast into hell are those that would not correct in this life their lives as sinners not people of bride that are born again because if you're born again you're going to try your best to get straight right you're going to have a repentant attitude you're going to have an attitude about it of godly sorrow you don't have that attitude or that thought well you might not be born again you know you just might not be born again i want everything straight what was the old saying i don't want no trouble when you get down at the river anybody thoughts or comments uh first timothy 5 24 says some men's sins are open beforehand going before the judgment and some men they follow after right so if you don't get it straight here you're gonna have to give an account for anything but if you get it straight here you don't have to carry it there exactly that's what timothy was saying some men are open beforehand in other words you've confessed it and got it over with but some are going to follow you if you don't it's going to follow you exactly that judgment that he's talking about right here right not a white throne judgment but that judgment exactly because the whole scripture right here talking about christian right talking about christian people see there's two judgments right exactly wipe your own judgment and the judgment of the deeds done in the body whether good or bad that's two judgments that satire you can appear at one or the other but just remember forever sin i love this is what i love you know everything that i repent of i can't be brought that up again i mean true repentance he's really sorry you know god will never bring that again because he puts it in the sea of forgiveless and he'll never bring it up to you you may have to answer for other things but you'll never have to answer for that that's what i love because it's pure and clean but that keeps me as repentant as i can be to say i'm sorry lord i'm sorry i just want to do what's right anybody else brother ryan about question uh i have a question about gifts and callings brother dale how did you know you were called to preach and then how would especially a new christian find their gift or calling first off how did i know well to be truthful to you even back when i was a sinner that's the reason i can preach on the gifts and try to place them in order and believe it the prophet made the statement one day he said that's just the way it was said some of you were just a little different remember that some of you were just a little different you ever thought about what kept you from doing wrong you ever thought about what kept you from lying and cheating stealing you know i was a kid maybe you don't know but i'm talking about big things what kept you when others around you went after all of those things see something was dealing with me all the time knew that but there was no way to express it to anyone because i never found anybody that had any understanding you've heard me tell the story that i met god when i was 11 years old in a baptist church i seen him standing there not as a form not as he's six foot taller now i saw a form but i knew it was almighty god and i searched for that god all through my life i read as much as i could i was done i studied the bible things you talking about a calling you see one day it just began to click after becoming a christian after coming in this message after being born again that would have thrown me on over into life about somewhere in the neighborhood of 33 30 years of age we'll say things started working a little different and i seen that there was a gift that i had but i've seen what the prophet said you can't depend on gifts because everybody can have a gift so it couldn't be that it couldn't be this that gift but it was something was different and i guess the thing that always held me to be different was one thing i've always believed the word to be god's word sure we were baptist sure we didn't understand a lot of things but i still believed it to be god and that's where i read it and studied it i cried out before god to find an answer for what this was that was bothering me i've never explained my whole christian experience but yet it was just something real when other people talked about god they talked about him off you under her back back there over there i begin to see him right here where we're at walking with us and dwelling with us yeah something was different i didn't lie cheat steal it was just something i didn't do i didn't make it on the basis of christianity to say i didn't do those things but i just make it on the basis that you don't have to do it i put it back to you you don't have to do wrong i'm living proof that you don't have to do wrong but as the word begin to unfold brother moat trying to help me he said i don't understand you said i said i don't understand at all he said quit trying to figure these things out and just accept god for what it is i said well i guess that's the best way to do it that's i at least got an answer but you see still nobody could bring me to that one that i met in that building in that church and as time went on brother moat said well you you're you're ministering i said no i said i'm a deacon i said i can out to teach i said we can do services i'll take care of things you know you know how it started here we started with the services he and i he was the pastor and i was just his assistant but i began to see the word just keep unfolding it unfolded to a place to where i could see what was going on did that make you anything no that's what i'm trying to explain the more you think of yourself as being something and less the fact that you are maybe that didn't come out right but the less of the fact that you really are anything the best way to find out whether anything is just be the worst read the least of all and say god help me but you see back there i was i loved the word i told my wife you've heard me tell it i told my wife i said it the way the bible looks it'll be there'll be two prophets come before the end of the world malachi 3 malachi 4. see we baptist could handle malachi 3. because the bible tells you you know about the john and the coming and what it was to do and and the things that was to take place of uh excuse me with malachite three but it would be luke 117 right through there we could pick up and understand a little bit about john but before i even become into the message or anything i could see that there was something about that it looked looked real so when brother moat said you ever heard of said if you you believed in prophets said we'd we do because he knew the baptist baptists will take teachers or sometimes they want pastors and they will handle the evangelists but the prophets and the apostles is out for them they won't take that part of the ministry but you see that was the thing he said he said what do you think about this malachi 4 i said what are you telling me about malachi 3 well he proceeded to explain it to me you say part of my experience is what i'm trying to explain you ask the point i'm trying to explain part of my experience how do i know and see as remote proceeded to explain what was to transpire under malachi 4. i had no troubles that was where you've heard me tell the story that he asked me said what do you believe on the god head i said one true and living god god in three persons blessed trinity because that was the only way i could explain it i had no way of explaining that was a baptist explaining baptists believe in one god but they explained it as god in three persons blessed trinity he said your trinity just like anybody else i said please explain yourself sir he explained it when he got through explaining to one god i said i don't believe that no more i don't believe in three gods no more ain't got no more problems with that that's straightened out come in the message and begin to study the message and preaching on things and talking to people about things and talking about daniel 70 weeks and the seals and the things when others seem to be scared brother moak could handle seal one two three four and jump and pick up six i'm telling you the truth now i'm not throwing off on him and he helped me to bring me through all of those things but he could never see seven and five he couldn't put them together he couldn't because he told me he said brother around said you know that one seal will tie the entire bible together he said brother dale i don't see that i said well i'm beginning to because one seal is one true and living god and that'll tie all the seals together but see as time went on i'm saying this back when i was a deacon talking and preaching and teaching sunday school but never confessed that i was a minister i would never confess that that i was a preacher i waited and waited and waited and then one day it just opened the words you've wrought is the proof of where you are that's the thing that i've taught you what i've taught you as a congregation is one thing what you are is the word of god for the hour and the time that you're living that's the proof of it going how do you know you're called to preach because it comes to a basis that the word unfolded until i had to deny no word i didn't have anything to deny of any of the word the prophet brought and defended it over and over and my whole purpose in life since i've been in the message is to defend the fact of like when everybody didn't want to preach daniel 70 weeks that was the thing i wanted to preach when they didn't want to preach the seals that was the thing that i wanted to preach because i wanted to try to help people to understand and as i did it began to put it and it put it to the bases that i can stand here now and say i haven't ever had anybody that attacked it oh they don't believe it i mean come and attacked it come and show me where i missed it paul do you know where you are the word whereof i'm called paul had a message to bring that was his calling to preach now that's exactly what i've explained to you in 15 minutes or so the prophet had a message to bring the message he had to bring was his call to the ministry that's why i'm so adamant of preaching about the fifo ministry is because the fifo ministry has their calling is to preach what the prophet brought that's their calling what do you if you want to know whether you call to preach or not what do you do with the word see what it does hey don't worry about it give some callings or route repentance god will straighten us up do it but then when you come to a basis that i wanted to quit i did one time brother mulff was here he'd like and tell it i quit preaching he said what we're going to do i said well i can teach sunday school to do something you know services that came here you can't house but i'm just going to sit down a while he said why i said because i brought to the congregation my thoughts and ideas of as much as i can understand they're into your hands he said well i don't know i said we believe praying for the sick i said we'll we'll get by you see that it took many years for me to realize that there was no way to sit down and stop because what had started a good work would finish it paul what is your call to the ministry the word were of i'm called brother dale what is your call to the ministry to follow the prophet's message to every degree that i can and ideas i could have is my call see that way it's not gifts it's not somebody hollering out of a tree that you're called to preach or somebody talk you know telling you it's god just using his gift to keep bringing it i made a statement in a minister's meeting years ago and i still don't back up i said none of you have added one word to what i've taught they didn't like that i'm sure but it was a true you say well why are you telling us because it was the truth they'd done the best they could do and i appreciate it you don't understand this old boy i went back to the baptist church and or didn't go back a man come down i thanked him for helping me and doing everything he could do to help me to line up in a christian life i had to do that twice in this message in gainesville had i went to the brother and i said brother i appreciate you i appreciate everything you've done you've done you've helped me you you've done i told brother molt over and over i said you've helped me you've brought me to this and this station that i stand today is sitting on the basis of what i believe about what you've taught i talked to a minister down in athens and thanked him why because i thank god for all the people that have tried to help me and try to do whether it be good or bad whether it be hard or rough whether it be something rough or or just telling you how rough it is or just telling you how far how far you are off or whatever that's why you always hear me saying come on let's talk right let's sit down and talk let's see what god has to say see because i know gifts and callings are without repentance i didn't repent to get a gift i didn't do that but repentance activated the gift that's why i didn't preach that that you always was eternal because i didn't believe it and i've never taught it that way but i know something was always there i'd walk in the woods and know somebody was walking with me i'd pray and cry out knowing somebody was there but sometimes he wouldn't be too close he had to let me fight it out to know paul what is your call the word whereof i'm called to preach the mystery come on the title today mystery of his will see if you're a minister you have a mystery a part of the mystery you don't have all of it we're not not in the basis of that come on these ministers they have a mystery they've never thought of it maybe as to what i'm saying to this day but a mystery a part of god's word is they have to bring that you remember this statement i've always made to you and tried to get you i said what is your calling in the bible what is your scripture that you hold true with your life in in reality more than you do of anything else what is it how many times do i ask you that but how many times have i told you that when i saw it in the bible i saw there would be two prophets come before the end of the world i couldn't get john the baptist i could get that straight we had that working but we couldn't do it with malachi 4. that was a mystery for the end time brother branham what is your calling to preach a prophet listen a prophet in the bible a man that the first thing he can remember is a vision at 18 months of age but brother brown and what is your calling he said there's a mystery paul had a mystery and he had to explain it there's a mystery that i've got to explain he said the mystery is the bride of jesus christ becoming one with god that was his mystery that was his message what did he always preach go to 63 and go on through the message and listen and see if he didn't cover every message something about the what you are what god has made you you can see his mystery his mystery was to type all mysteries that's why it says in in revelations 10 where the mystery of god would be complete it doesn't say mysteries it says mystery one mystery singular brother random had one mystery one god and man becoming one that was his mystery that's what he wanted to see that's what i want to see how do i know that i'm called to preach because there's something inside of me the bible says you know how know what the fire that's built inside of you it's a mystery how many services have i preached on the mystery of god because that's what it is that's my call but how do you know because you you say that you never had a voice talk to you or anything like that no but i just watched him work his way for 50 years i've watched him work his way to try to guide a church into the word of god that is the mystery okay now what was the other part about the i think i got about five minutes you covered it all but uh i think you covered it all but i was the other part was uh how would a young christian especially find their gift or calling but he really covered it all right i'll tell you this way just like i told my own son if you ever think in any way that you're called to preach run no no i'm going to go help oh you're going to go help god oh glory you're going to help god he don't need me and you we need him well i'm trying to explain gifts even playing the instruments and things see god give you those gifts use them for his glory and honor and he moves you up into the body of gifts of nine spiritual gifts wisdom knowledge temperance you know all kinds of things but then he moves up into what we moved up to into the fifo ministry to cover the faithful ministry where they're a special group of people that it's not the man that comes predestinated eternally but it's the gift or calling that was within his life that gift is the word of god and then finalizing it with bringing the prophet because he could cover all gifts he had the word of god for our age that's why that it hurts me to hear ministers after preaching 20 30 40 years old and then hear them fall away you just cry anybody else see anything i forgot just a minute all right just come ahead musicians and let's just go ahead we'll pick this part up and just bring it into the message part going through from from today with this but i hope you i hope you pay attention to one thing my honor and glory all goes to jesus christ whatever you got your gifts your musicians you your song leaders your your your jobs and things your mystery is involved in your life serve god out of joy not out of a have to make it a happy thing let your family know that there's something that you wanting them to see about god i'm talking about men women children let god let god rule us or move us and let god be known through our hearts and lives that others may see and then you'll come out of it at least of one thing what is the one thing you do when you walk up to brother dale and you say well how are you doing what does it say well if i told you how i felt you'd take me to the emergency room if i told you exactly like it was going on you'd take me to the undertaker but you see to talk about him as he really is is my joy in life about christ christ in you paul said the hope of glory go ahead brother what we got anybody have a need and then we'll cook we have one night to magnify his name [Music] and worshiping [Music] [Music] [Applause] christ
