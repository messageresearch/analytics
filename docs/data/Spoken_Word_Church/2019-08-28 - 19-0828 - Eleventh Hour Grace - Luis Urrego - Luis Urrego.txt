Lord a clap of praise this afternoon hey now is he worthy he he brought to the church so you got something to thank him for if you didn't have something to thank him forth before then right Amen thank God for His mercy and His grace in this hour amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord appreciated brother Dale and then just the confidence and invitation in gate Amen so I just appreciate that and appreciate each and every one of you amen to that made it out today to come to the house of the Lord and I know that you don't come to see me or come to see a man that's that's not your desire I believe that you want to hear about about the word amen and it's not just for us to hear of a man but let that word sink in our hearts amen so that we can be more like Christ amen praise the Lord Jesus I appreciate your prayers as we were out this past Sunday we were ministering a brother brother burly's church literally he's he's in Africa and so he asked me the week before if I could take his service and we had a good time there and I I ministered to them on that on that series that I preached last year here about the kingdom of God the mystery of the kingdom of God and and I used the same PowerPoint presentation and you can you can see you can tell how how the people are so so hungry for the word right they're really really really hungry for the word they they they they were so enthused about after that's that service that they said but Louise could we have those notes could you give us that PowerPoint presentation could you get several people asked me for the for the copy of that cuz it's so it's so uh I even had one of them one of them tell me he's just he has it he hasn't come you know we came from Pentecostalism and straight I'm free and came to the message not too long ago but he said but Louisa I'm getting to a point now where I feel like I need I need more teaching I need more grounding he said and he said so he said this is this is fresher breath a breath of fresh air to me so so God knows what he's doing and so we just thank God for for that a man who I appreciate all of your prayers and thank God for using brother Wade as well cuz he's kind of shared some of the same same things with me when he was while he was gone this past weekend they met praise the Lord Jesus you love the Lord hey man so let's just go to the word Amen we're just gonna read this one verse and then I'll have you be seated in Zechariah chapter 4 verse 7 very familiar scripture to us in Zechariah chapter 4 verse 7 amen who art thou o great mountain before zerubabbel thou shalt become a plane and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying not just grace right elbow grace like jesus said verily verily I say unto you a man grace grace unto it amen I find that very interesting regarding the of what we're gonna talk about I want to be speaking about the eleventh hour of grace amen in this hour amen praise the Lord so let's just go to the Lord in prayer our Heavenly Father as we come before you Lord Jesus we thank you Father for your word thank you that we have the privilege to even open back the pages of your word but Lord God we know Heavenly Father that we're part of you Lord so father God this is this is this is part of us Lord where you said Lord if my word abides in you and you abide in me Lord God and that's what we will father so Lord God we ask that you now Lord take full control Lord of the service Lord you take full control of my lips Lord that I may just say something Lord to help somebody Lord maybe they may not grab get everything but Lord God I believe that you can reveal it unto them Lord in due time even at this moment you can do so father well because I can't give no one of Revelation but you can Lord Jesus so I pray now that you would just bless your people meet every need amongst us and father God even those that are out Lord bless them Lord where they're at this moment sick ones Lord God be with them Lord we pray we commit this time into your hands now and ask you these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen praise the Lord st. you may be seated amen amen we want to we've all heard about the eleventh hour and the 11th hour workers and we're gonna get to that to that scripture here in just a moment that parable where Jesus was talking about there was it was it was actually the parable of the laborers in the vineyard amen and so and it's very interesting you know for because we only really grasped one verse of that parable and that's the 11th hour worker right which we are at which we are we are those 11 while our workers there's many types in there one of them being that we are those 11th hour workers in this hour amen we are we should be working to build up the kingdom of God in this hour eman and so there's so much to do and so much and so little time amen now how many feel that way amen but you know what Saints God has made us laborers in his vineyard and he's invited us Amen to go work in his vineyard and not to stay idle not to be idle in this hour amen because Saints there so is so much to do in this hour so but before we get there I wanted to show you guys something to just kind of perk up your interest and so the brothers in the back and they could they could bring up well I'll just I'll have them they got a few pictures that I want I wanted to show but very interesting regarding the number 11 and I'm just gonna read this right here for you says in numerology the number 11 is considered the master number the reason is this number carries a vibrational frequency of balanced number eleven signifies invention refinement fulfillment vision and congruence in a person amens are you reading right there and you can read the astrology astrology part of it as well but the number eleven has has very interesting meanings one of the meanings is that there there are there are eleven a hundred eleven days from the time that it's September 11th to December 31st if you didn't know that all right very interesting because then you got you got the end of the year right and when we are at the end time right it took it took going back to to 9/11 which we're about to come to an anniversary here but it took 11 years to build the World Trade Center 1966 when it was started it started to be built and to 1977 when it was completed as you can see there it took 11 years to build a World Trade Center the sunspot cycle or the solar cycle lasts for 11 years as some of you may already know this but but if you don't know well that's another wrinkle in your brain September 11th is the 250 fourth day of the of the year and so if you if you take those numbers 2 plus 5 plus 4 equals 11 the world trade center trade center resembled the number 11 as you see there New York where the world trade center resided is the 11th state in the Constitution for those of you who like sports in many popular sports around the world such as American football cricket field hockey and soccer there are 11 players in each team the flag of Canada my wife might like this the flag of Canada features a maple leaf having 11 points that's very interesting now for those of you who might know what these movies are the most Oscar Awards for any movie is 11 the feat was achieved by Ben Hur in 1959 great movie by the way Titanic in 1997 and and and I thought it was interesting that it the Lord of the Rings The Return of the King in 2000 kind of interesting that that the return of the king then we all know this one because brother branham mentioned their World War 1 ended on the 11th day of the 11th month in the 11th hour I don't think that's coincidence amen and of course world war 2 is usually displayed as world war 2 but that's one plus one which is 11 C so there are many other things you know I just wanted to add a couple of wrinkles there to your brain just kind of perk your interest but there's a lot of significance in the number 11 right so it's very interesting that God amen when Jesus was talking about this parable that we're about to read here in Matthew chapter 20 he talks about the 11th hour workers all right amen so so if we if we read it we read here when before if you actually before you start reading Matthew chapter 20 if you start reading Matthew chapter 20 you have to get the context of what Jesus was given that parable and you really can't get the context that context of why Jesus was was talking about that parable about the laborers working in the vineyard unless you read Matthew chapter 19 in the last three to four verses and in those last three or four verses in the other believe it's in Matthew 19:27 Peter tells Jesus and he tells him this he said master we've left everything we've given up everything to follow you what are we going to receive as they're interesting he asked that question because to me that's kind of like that attitude that we some of us take that you think that you're gonna get closer to God by how many brownie points you have or how or what you've done Amen or what you can do or but you know what says God is not interested about what you can do or what you have done or what you were even doing now amen because this whole thing is about the mercy and the grace of God amen you were never seeking God amen it was always grace seeking you amen because I you know st. I just thought some of you who were out and lived in the world and things like that I mean I'm sure you when I was partying I wasn't thinking about God I was thinking about satisfying the flesh amen and doing and doing the things of the world so it wasn't you were never seeking God it was always Christ seeking you amen but sometimes we think Amen that there's something that we can do to get closer to God and we get this maybe this Catholic mentality that there's some maybe if I could stay 15 extra minutes on my knees maybe I maybe pray as I'm as I'm walking around on my knees yeah man the whole the whole house and then praying like this and the whole place maybe I can get some merit from God but you know what Saints there's nothing that you can do to merit the grace amen in Salvation and in the Holy Spirit amen the only thing he asks of you a menace to believe his word amen praise the Lord so Matt so so Peter took this attitude that there's something that they did because we left our family we left everything to follow you what do you have what do you have in store for us Jesus what do you have in store for us amen and of course Jesus he replies to them there in the next few verses and he tells them verily of course yeah if you give up the world and if you give up your family your parents your your your brothers and your sisters for my sake to follow me yeah you're gonna be rewarded he tells him he tells him that you shall receive an hundredfold and shall inherit everlasting life or eternal life of course but but what he's but it is not because of the fact that they gave up those things amen you see that they're gonna inherit eternal life and then that's when he goes and then and in the next chapter before he says for many in verse 30 there Matthew 19:13 but many that are first shall be last and shall be first then he goes on in chapter 20 and starts talking about this parable and so what we're gonna do is we want to take just try to go out a little verse by verse and we'll just see how the Lord leads amen I have so much content here so I I would appreciate it if you try to just pay attention amen I know it's Wednesday night but I believe God has something in store for us say man you just try to pay attention try not to fall asleep and if you fall asleep and then shake yourself amen in Matthew 20 verse 1 it says for the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is in householder which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard amen I want you to notice that in that verse that the that its distinction is made between the kingdom of heaven and the kingdom of Earth amen this parable that Jesus is about to talk about is is is gonna is going to talk about is the Kingdom of Heaven or the kingdom of God or the kingdom as the scripture calls it at times they had this has nothing to do with the kingdom of the world of this earth is this all about the kingdom of heaven amen praise God and and one of the characteristics of this kingdom of heaven is that the higher the the householder here the owner of the vineyard went out looking for servants to hire you see so that's the reason why the servants were not looking for him it's Christ seeking the servants amen it was Christ seeking you amen it's not you seeking God you see praise the Lord in John 4:23 it says Jesus said but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him amen Christ is always seeking a man because Saints let me tell you what in John 3:16 he says for for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever should believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life eternal life amen God's given the whole world the opportunity but God also knows and he may says it in another scripture that Christ died for many so really it's not everybody that's going to accept him but God offers and brings and gives the offering to everybody come and receive amen that's the reason Saints why we should we should not we should be careful about looking down on people you don't have a right to look down on somebody just because they're wearing earrings or because they don't look just like you you don't know that person three four or five ten years down the road will probably be whole lot better off than probably what you are at that moment thinking it that way do you just don't know in Saints we have to think think think that the grace of God is is is is more than what you think it is we think that the grace of God and just encapsulates God's the way God dealt with us but that the way he dealt with us he can't deal with the drunker of the rock star out there he can't deal with the with the with the man that's heavy on drugs with the pablo escobar's out there he can't deal with none of them but I'm here to tell you Saints that he can and that he has and that he's still amen saving amen in this hour so there's no case that is lost amen he can't lose no one that's his amen praise God we know that there's some there are part of the bride and some that are part of the church amen but still it's all God's grace it's not anybody it's not Satan's grace hey man praise the Lord amen now in John 6:44 the Bible says no man can come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw him so you can't come to Christ unless he draws you unless he's pulling you amen unless unless he's pulling amen you amen closer to and how does he pull you through his word amen he pulls you through his word amen you have to hear the word first in order for you to grow closer to Christ amen you just think come one day the trake up one day so I'm just going to go to church and they're at church I'm gonna get saved now it didn't happen that way right amen maybe it has before but but but you know what for the majority of us it probably never happen that way amen you for some ways huh somebody needed to talk to you somebody needed to say something you needed to pick up a tract you needed to pick up read a turn open the Bible there in that hotel room where you were doing whatever in that hotel room you picked you opened up the Bible and you saw that in John 3:16 where he said for God so loved the world God so loved me that He gave His only begotten Son a man the word had to draw you at some point in time Amen praise the Lord Jesus I'm just gonna bring this over here so I don't have to go back amen now and in John 6 65 he says and he said therefore said I unto you that no man can come unto me except if it were given unto Him of my father amen praise God so you don't have permission to go into the Lord's vineyard a men without first him calling you right now you really wouldn't want to you really don't want to because you're not seeking to go into the vineyard how many understand what I'm saying man you're not looking for God he's always looking for you amen praise God now these men that that that the labor that the owner of the vineyard was hiring they wanted to work I mean they they they were they were waiting but they didn't they didn't know who it was that they were gonna go to amen they wanted to be hard and we know that this householders Jesus amen praise the Lord now in verse 2 it says and when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day he sent them into his vineyard amen now you notice how the the the owner of the vineyard he had to make an agreement with them for this penny a day whatever how much that was worth back then after a penny a day here and I mean this is of my goodness yeah you're below the poverty line for a penny a day so we know it's not talking about one cent a penny that like but it's another type of money amen that they had back then we know that these laborers they represent Christians we are Christians amen and the lord of the vineyard he had to bargain with them in order to get them to work amen I'll give you a penny if you come and in labor with me here in this vineyard so they agreed and they went to go work for him right amen now this penny Saints to me it represents the token the Holy Ghost eternal life amen that's what it represents amen praise the Lord which is directly what Jesus said in Matthew nineteen twenty nine which we were just read they said they said that and everyone that had forsaken houses or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my name's sake shall receive an hundredfold and shall inherit everlasting life so these laborers amen they they gave up what they were doing for that day to go work for the father or go work for this for this man right which represents the Lord Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord Jesus now in order for you to be a candidate of any of God's benefits you must agree with the Word of God first amen you have to agree with the word amen in order for you you have to believe you have to agree that that Holy Ghost is for me in order for you to get the Holy Ghost you have to agree and believe that the healing is for you in order for you to get healing right you have to believe a man that the promises of God are for you and that their yay and amen if you want to receive any of its benefits so that's the same thing these labors they had to agree with the with the owner of the vineyard in order to get to work in the vineyard we agree with you so we got that's one reason what we're gonna work for you amen amen praise the Lord Jesus as a reason saying is why many many they want Christ and they want Christ as their Savior but as you've heard a lot many times before but they don't want him as their Lord everybody wants Christ to save them Oh cry oh Jesus saved my soul saved me and he'll save you but then when it comes time to giving up things in life giving up your pride giving up your filthy mouth giving up cigarettes giving up video games so that you can spend more time with God that was one of the things I had to give up video games because why I saw that these things was not drawing me closer to God so that was I gave up these things I don't you know pick them back up a few years later but you know but I mean you know again there's nothing wrong with the video game nothing wrong with those things only if you let those things take over your life take over your marriage take over your your spending time with your family bringing them to church that's when it's wrong that's that's when it's that's when it's become a problem amen then you can be put you put you put your input that you fill in the blank video games whatever it is for you a man praise God because my battle is in your battle and your battle isn't my battery man we all have we all struggle with different things they men but amen greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world amen praise the Lord Jesus amen so hmm so these these are these men now it says here then the last part of that verse he sent them unto his vineyard amen so now that they agreed with that with the with the master of the vineyard they he went ahead and sent them to the vineyard you see there it reminded me of that scripture in the Bible where Jesus tells Peter and he says in Luke 22 verse 31 it says and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat but I have prayed for you man isn't that awesome that Jesus would pray for us you know this week this week where it was last week we had a devotional with her with the girls and I told him who started the devotion I said hey do you know that Jesus Christ prayed for you you want to read the prayer that he made for you you know and they didn't probably had never thought of it that way but Christ there's a scripture in the Bible there's a whole chapter dedicated to Christ's prayer for you right in John chapter 16 or 17 amen yes and so and so here Jesus prayed for told Peter hey I'm praying for you Peter amen wouldn't you just love to have that amen and he already did though that's the thing he's already prayed for you just read John 17 and you'll see and all you got to do is just put your name wherever he wherever he says thee or wherever he says them just put your name in there and that's the prayer he prayed for you if we had time we'd read the whole chapter man cuz that's a good chapter but he says I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted then strengthen thy brethren a man when you have been convinced when these laborers work Vince that the mass this master is right there gonna get I'm gonna get a penny eternal life so that I could I could go work amen I'll be working in this vineyard amen then I can go ahead and strengthen my brethren amen it's when the whole when you receive Christ amen the Holy Ghost will put you in action they meant that eternal life will put you in action to go do something amen not to stand idle not not not not not to say well well I said before we're just gonna sit back in and what wait for the train to come by no these Labor's were put to work these Labor's had something to do a men that's the reason why they got eternal life amen to go work amen God is expecting for us to do something in this hour a man not just to sit around and wait Amen there's something that you and I must fulfill you and I need to find out what is it Lord that I need to do in this hour Lord what is it that that maybe you're just to be a good farmer or you know or maybe you're just a good that's fine but Lord even with my farming tools or with my farming trade what is it that I can use this event for your glory and for your honor maybe as I'm working with somebody in the field I can bring somebody to Christ I don't know but since we were put here to serve Him and to serve others amen not just to serve our pockets not just to fill our pockets in our in our and our bank accounts amen because all that's going to perish oh that's going to go away as it's been said before you have never seen a you know that cart a hearse is it a hearse pulling a u-haul truck I've never seen that out in the streets I've only seen the hearse and then a couple of several cars when sometimes it's be like 30 minutes worth of cars that you're waiting because of family members you know but there's no money no money I don't I never seen it no belongings you know the Egyptians back then they thought they could be bared with their belongings and their money and they're just as much dust as anybody else has died the dust never went over there and grabbed a couple of cents you know to do what I know that sounds silly but but sometimes we think silly now and that's why God said amen let this mind of Christ being you right when the mind of Christ is in you then your your priorities are gonna be different your mindset is going to change regarding the way you live life and the way you think about others and the way you even treat others now your your your your your priority is what can I do for you Lord how can how can I be of service to my people too but to the Brethren to the people out here so that you can give me glorified Lord Jesus amen praise the Lord because you can only truly serve Christ when you've really gotten an experience with Christ and I've just read in just a few of these verses in Romans 8:28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them that are called according to his purpose they man see these laborers were called and there and and and because they were called they went to work so you have to be called amen first corinthians 1:9 says God is faithful by whom you were called unto the Fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ our Lord I appreciate the brothers pulling the Scriptures up second Thessalonians 2 13 and 14 says but we are bound to give thanks always God for you brethren beloved of the Lord because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth we're on to he called you by our gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ how many 1 obtained the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ amen well the Bible says that he who has he who he's called he's already justified and he's already justified he's already sanctified and he sanctify he's already glorified amen and in the mind of God it's already been done and I know we're waiting for the manifestation of it that's why you got to keep eating that's why you got to keep drinking that's why you got to keep feeding and keep laboring hey man praise the Lord Hebrews 9:15 says and and for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first Testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance 1st Peter 2:9 2:10 but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood an holy nation a peculiar people you're not like the whole world so so you don't need to look like the world because you're peculiar amen as far as what God has given you amen the world doesn't have that right and it's gonna manifest on the outside that that God has given to you amen on the inside you see if God's giving you eternal life he's giving you this token amen then yeah it's gonna manifest on the outside though other people will see this token on display praise the Lord a royal priesthood an holy nation a peculiar people that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness which in times past were not a people but are now the people of God yeah praise the Lord now here in verse 3 we continue here with the parable so these these laborers they agreed with the master to work for a penny and they went out to work and he went out about the third hour now who is the heat this is the master of the vineyard he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace so now the third hour if you look at the Jewish the time time time the third hour would be around 9:00 a.m. somewhere around that time and the lord of the vineyard even at this time because he hired his the the first set of laborers around 6 a.m. to start working now it's 9 a.m. now he's got a higher no some more amen the lord of the vineyard he's still looking for laborers amen he hasn't stopped seeking he knows that there's people out there there that are his Amen praise the Lord aren't you glad that he didn't stop seeking you what if he said oh it's 9:00 a.m. I already got everybody that I need you know I already got it no he has attributes that were part of him that he knew before the foundation of the world in the back of his mind they were that you are part of them you are one of those attributes I mean they had to come here on earth to manifest him amen so he's not going to lose not one and these attributes all make up the body of the the body of Christ which is the bride Amen the bride in this hour praise the Lord and verse four it says and he said unto them when he went out to those to those there at 9:00 a.m. and he said unto them go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoever is right I will give you now you notice the wording here here is different than the word then then the wording from the first for the first set the first ones that he had asked around 6:00 in the morning he bargained with them and told them hey you work for me for a penny all right but here these he's telling you go to the vineyard and whatsoever is right in other words whatsoever is fair I'm gonna pay you so if you if you think about the laborers you know the laborers these laborers were standing around idle you know they were not doing anything they were just standing around you know waiting for somebody to come hire them so you know being that it's 9:00 a.m. they probably think well hey I'm sure he's gonna give us something fair you know fair he knows it's 9:00 a.m. so let's just go go go and work amen praise the Lord and so he didn't tell them how much they were gonna get paid he just told him that they were gonna get paid go work whatever is right that's what I'll pay you a man these laborers they had confidence in him that they were he was gonna pay them the fair a fair pay amen then in verse 5 again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour and did likewise in other words he did the exact thing at 12:00 p.m. and that 3:00 p.m. that day I was getting hot you know 12:00 1:00 p.m. my goodness man is scorching outside I can't wait for cool weather man and so here is that time and he's still looking for Labor's to go work amen as they say the heat is on hey man but you know what Saints things can get hot and things can get pretty pretty hard and tough amen but there's nothing that God can't do amen there's nothing that Christ they met it's not too tough that too tough for him that he can't do it or that he can't handle amen he still a man expects that he knows that you can do all things through him who strengthens you amen no matter how hard it is no matter how the situation looks bleak look scorching Amen he said that all you can do all things through Christ who strengthens you hey man now that's a promise that he made and if we believe that promise you'll fulfill it through our lives a memory in about the eleventh hour in verse six about the eleventh hour he went out now this 11th hour this is 5:00 p.m. now sun's about to go down it's the evening time amen and about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle and said unto them why stand ye here all the day idle right now you notice now that he even treated these on the 11th hour differently than even the ones at the at the at the 12 p.m. and the 3 p.m. hours because now he's asking them a question why why are you standing here idle in other words it's almost the end of the day it's almost time for everybody for the whistle to blow and to go home why are you see here standing not doing anything right that's why he's asking him the question weren't you supposed to be working all day here at 6 p.m. we stopped working because that was around 5 p.m. the 11th hour for them and the Jewish time was around 5 p.m. 6 p.m. you know it was it was it was everything's you know they sleep during that time a man it was it's getting dark everything stops why are you standing here idle and saying I'd like to I'd like to think that Christ is asking some of us that same question us the 11th hour workers we're supposed to be the 11th hour workers why are we standing around waiting on the bus why I you can hear a pin drop on this carpet Saints I have to ask myself the same question why are we doing in this late hour that we're living rain Saints what is it that you are doing amen the day is far spent the hour is late we know the coming of the Lord is soon at hand we know we know the end time is here why are we doing about that oh I'm just gonna play more video games I was gonna go watch more TV I'm just gonna go get involved in more things and more money money-making schemes and more business thing things that take you away from from from from from God not knocking none of those things they have their place but what are you doing amen to remember this all has to do about lifting the kingdom of heaven up what are you doing about lifting the kingdom of heaven up or are you just worried about yourself or are you worried only about what you can get out of this life because let me tell you sayings that is not the Spirit of Christ what are you doing in this late hour a man you see it was 5 p.m. the day was almost gone and they had only one hour left I know could you see the master was surprised to see them standing amen so what ask that question what part am i playing in the body of Christ now you really can't play a part if you don't have the Holy Spirit as simple as that if this word is is not a reality to you Saints if it hasn't become a reality or revelation to you that has that has sunken down and then and then you're anchored in this word and nothing can move you then you can't really pay a player a role in the body right we want you to be around I'm not talking I'm not saying you know here at the church but I'm just saying we want Christ wants you to be around amen Christ wants you to hear his word Christ wants you to to pay attention to what's going on amen but sometimes we get in the way of him doing something in our lives you know when when when sometimes we tell it we tell our kids you know to do something in the house or clean the house or do something or or we're all cleaning the house together right and sometimes Thomas says if better they just go over and sit sit over there cuz it's almost like they're just getting in the way of you doing what you're supposed to do because they're just standing there and you've told them go do this go do that go to that and they just stand there amen but you see we want to make sure he meant that we're we're not standing amen when just sitting idle it man why are you doing what are you doing for Christ in this hour praise the Lord so here we continue reading in verse 7 and this is the answer that the 11th hour workers the 11th hour workers gave them I say unto him because no man hath hired us see the intention of these men they wanted to be hired amen but nobody would hire them they waited all day long and nobody hired them praise God amen he saith unto them go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoever is right that's all you receive now he didn't bargain with them for a penny he just told them the same thing he told the previous ones whatsoever is right that's what I'll give you so to go work for one hour my goodness it's almost time to go home it's almost time it's almost time to to you know to go ahead and just clock out you know but really they weren't working so there's nothing to clock out amen still even at this late hour this labor this this owner this vineyard wanted them to go work I mean it doesn't matter the far the day is far spent there's still something for us to do in this hour amen you know brother Branham said always remember what brother Branham said he said you know work as if Christ is coming in a thousand years but live as if he's coming tomorrow amen do what you need to do in your physical life amen save up do whatever it needs to be done amen there's nothing wrong with those things but live amen as if he's coming tomorrow amen as if this thing culminates tomorrow at 6:00 in the morning all right 9:00 in the morning amen because Saints you don't know the day in the hour amen reunion you don't know that the time when may may be your time a man your time to go we're not assured of this life this life isn't given to us with with an assurance we have our life is fragile amen and you may not make it down those stairs tonight you know something could happen amen but he's in it our our life is in his hands and now praise God that's what we put our trust in him so these labors these 11th hour workers they gladly accepted to offer no questions asked they didn't ask him any questions they just okay that's fine we'll go work because it was better to start working in the eleventh hour than then to not work at all it was better it was better to do something even in that late of the hour than to not do anything at all amen so moving on here says so when even was come the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward now you notice that it says there the evening they even the evening time came a man and the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward amen who is that Stewart the Holy Ghost amen call the laborers and give them their hire in other words give them what they were there owed what their what the what the what the pay but look out what he says he says beginning from the last unto the first amen now you we think that there should be the other way around because you know give the other ones that he started to started working first give them the pay a man and then and then at the light do you know the last ones that came in in the eleventh hour then they get paid last but this labor this owner this vineyard wanted to fir the last ones that came in to get paid first amen praise God amen now in John 9 for says I must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work Amen so this is the time Amen they couldn't work any more and it was evening time no they couldn't work any more amen so here we see that the laborers they were going to get paid now if we continue reading here in verse 9 it says and when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour they received man a penny it was the exact same pay that the first one say Mandic they were hired were bargained with the with the owner of the of the vineyard to get paid these 11th hour workers got the same pay now we all know that we all know this sense but here what's well what's interesting is that if you think if you're one of these labors if you're one of these workers what do you think Amen that here you were going to work and you're probably thinking well you know I'm gonna pay don't get paid only for just working one hour but here when you're getting your pay you're getting the exact same pay that the other ones are getting how do you think you're gonna feel a man as the labor that only worked for one hour as at 11th hour worker how do you think you'd feel what do you think that you'd think about that that master that owner of that vineyard oh my goodness yeah that's a good guy man I'd love to work for him I'd love to continue working for him my goodness only works for one hour and and and and and here he's paying me the exact same thing that he paid the others that have labored all the whole day my goodness and you know what you're so excited about it and you're so happy about it you probably go and tell the others tell other people about it Amen my goodness God gave me this this this eternal life amen God gave me this grace say man this this pay that he gave me amen and and in this in this late hour amen he's still filling with the Holy Ghost amen he's still doing great things in our lives amen he's still doing mighty things amen it wasn't just for back then but it wasn't just for the time when brother Branham was here Amen God is doing great things in this house God is doing great things in your day God is doing awesome things in each and every one of our lives and sometimes we overlook that pay or though or the benefits of serving Christ a man we overlooked a man I woke up this morning feeling fine I woke up with having on my mind I hope so didn't wake up with hell on your mind cuz if you wake up with Hell on your mind you gonna manifest hell Amen but God has given you such great things in this hour he meant so these laborers I'm sure they were excited they were happy amen praise the Lord each servant needed to be paid at the end of the same day they worked because see they needed it now if you read I just want to read this here invert Deuteronomy chapter 24 verse 14 through 15 if they they could bring that up and they have it up this is the law that that that was given to the two to them back then it says thou shalt not oppressed and hired servant that is poor and needy see so these laborers there were needy they needed to work they needed to be hired whether he be of thy brethren or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates at his day thou shalt give him his hire in other words at the end of the day you're gonna pay him so Jesus is bringing this this this this parable amen incorporating this in you know going back to what this says his day thou shalt give him his hire neither shall the Sun go down upon it in other words you're not the day's not gonna be over and you're not gonna pay this man because back then they would get paid the same day that they worked see today nowadays we work and we get paid maybe bi-weekly every two weeks or every week or every month I get paid every month but is it something you get used to it you have to budget your very wisely neither shall the Sun go down upon him for he is poor look this late for heat this labor is poor and setteth his heart upon it in other words he's waiting for it you see st. he's waiting for this pay a man he he's working in his desire a man is for this pay a man at the here at the end time amen and you have something that you desire in this our Saints amen your hope is in Christ amen you know amen you keep walking a man you keep serving the Lord you keep struggling you keep you keep fighting and then you keep Lavery you keep working but you know that at the end time amen there's gonna be is gonna pay off it's gonna be worth it praise God it's gonna be worth it your heart is set upon it right look what it says lest he cry against thee unto the Lord and it be a sin unto thee for so you see this owner this vineyard wasn't gonna allow for these men to say man this this man man he's goodness gracious you don't pay you go work for him and he don't even pay you hey you weren't gonna say that about him no and nobody's gonna say anything like that about the Lord Jesus Christ amen about his benefits you can't say nothing you can't say you can't ever say that God has ever failed you never I can't ever say that I've always felt him but he has never failed me amen I felt to do what I'm supposed to do I felt to be involved with what I'm supposed to be involved or do what I'm supposed to do but he never one time has ever failed me amen his mercies are great a man they keep it there abounding amen he has never failed me yet and I don't think he'll ever failed me right I'll probably fail him many other times I don't want to a man but he that's why he's mercy and grace is there amen now we're getting to a point here Saints I appreciate you listening so kin so intently so you see Saints that grace is the main theme of the Christian life yeah because those that came in first or those who come in last needed it just the same they all needed that page just the same amen but it's the it's it's it's what it's the amounts you see humanly thinking you'd read this and you think my goodness the ones that started working at 6:00 a.m. should get paid more but that's not what they agreed for that's not what they agreed with up with the lay with the master of the vineyard they agreed for one penny and then the other ones that came in well they're like what it's better than slates it is you know standing around so we're just gonna work for a couple of hours then either we're gonna get something they just didn't know exactly what but here they're at the end time amen they all get a penny they all get the same pay the Bible says for by grace are ye saved amen we don't deserve it but we need it hey man we need that grace we need that pay amen we need it in this hour my goodness that one of the darkest hours is this hour amen just the angel of the Lord just aloud just a little sliver of light there in there and that church age for you that's for you and me darkest hour that we live in we need the grace of God ma I need His grace I don't know about you but when the first came verse 10 going back to the parable says but when the first came in other words the ones that were hired at 6:00 in the morning they supposed that they should have received more they saw that the last one the 11th hour worker came in and he got to see the world he paid the same thing I'm getting I'm supposed to get paid are you only been working for one hour that's saying right man I can't believe this no Pam goodness you know they were and they were all excited you know get ready to get paid you know back then when they used to give out the paychecks at the end of the workday you know and you're excited and then something like that happens man getting paid the same thing I'll get petty he's all he been yet he's making the same that I'm making he's only been in here six months I've been here six years you know how many of us work with people like that [Laughter] hey murmuring and complaining amen you better be glad you got somewhere to work out hey man you better be glad that you got is giving you even the strength to even go to work man praise God's either things that we take take for granted even the health that you God gave you to wake up in the morning so that you can drive in the midst of and you were able to make it drive an hour to work through the Atlanta traffic brother Bob to just go to a train to get on a train and go to the office that's brother Bob's commute and you made it to work I'm grumbling complaining for what I'm making you know what you should be thinking there's a reason why I'm here there's a there's a reason why I'm here Lord you brought me here for a reason one I need to make money so I can feed my family to somebody needs to hear about Christ today or somebody needs to see a good testimony today or somebody needs something right that I can offer them today amen praise God God has you where you're at for a Pacific reason specific reason hey man don't look at it any other way amen so they supposed that they should have received more and they likewise received every man a penny amen so here at the end time and all throughout the church ages Amen this broad that has been coming up through all the churches is the exact same Holy Ghost no different Holy Ghost that Luther got than what we got Amen there's just more light on the word now thank God for that and you know Saints it makes me thinks it makes me think you know the people back then they struggled to even even be able to have a Bible to read in their language now we have the Bible over 1100 messages and much more in a device like this that we can carry around and we still don't read the Bible and we still don't don't don't don't study or listen to the word read the message and those people back then they struggles they labored throughout that hot Sun yeah amen and here we are God amen still giving us the same pay that they got back then amen praise God because it's the same Holy Spirit because it's the same grace amen praise God because Saints we are all equal in the sight of God amen there's no bigger eyes or little use amen we're all equal in his sight and when they had received it verse 11 they murderer against the good man of the house amen I mean how many of us sometimes Amen we see somebody being blessed and instead of you being happy for them you criticize it my goodness they're doing something for God right that church over there they're doing something for the Lord oh my but they're holding youth camps over here and they're doing this and that for the other and instead of us a man praying for them we criticize when Jesus told the disciples and he told him and he said it there for us amen and they're not against us if they're for spreading the kingdom of God amen they're not for against the kingdom of God so why why why kick it on the side of the curve and say it's nothing hey man if somebody's doing something for God amen let's see what we can do to help amen because maybe in turn that you can you're helping them you might be you might be to helping the cause you might be able to help even the ones that are working in that area you see what you just look at it that way Saints amen they murmured against the good man of the house same verse 12 these last have these last have wrought but one hour in other words they've worked for one hour and you have made them equal unto us well that's the what God is in the business of doing you're not bigger than me and I'm not bigger than you amen we're all equal in the sight of God we all need Christ just like anybody else needs Christ amen praise God which have borne the burden and heat of the day amen it reminds me of the prodigal son remember when the prodigal son he went out he took the father's inheritance and he went out and spent it and and women and bought a bunch of Xboxes and ps4s and a bunch of Nike shoes and a bunch of all kinds of stuff and and they just bend it and you know and then didn't even have a budget or anything I just thought that they could just you know he just spent it you know and one day he came to a point where he couldn't charge that that credit card anymore that debit card because he thought he had infinite funds he was getting ready to go buy some drinks for his friends there at the bar or wherever he was at come to find out he couldn't this is the the lady came back I said listen I can't I can give you one more drink that's for you guy came but you can't buy anymore you have no more money I can't charge the rest of this on your car but if it was nowadays they'd still go through cuz you know they want you in debt so I'd still go through but back then you know he couldn't continue and his riotous living because his money is all gone now so here he goes I've been getting off the dog track but he goes back to this house his father shows him grace right and here's his brother who then do that that he did with with with the money with his father's money he stayed at home he was faithful to God attitude to his father he was faithful and he obeyed him he did everything he was supposed to do and instead of his brother being excited just as excited as his father was to see his son come home from living riotously from living that way from from being in sin and eating with pigs no his brother gets upset with him and his brother gets upset with his own father - and says father I've been here with you all of my this time I never spent your missmiss spent your money I never did anything wrong I was a good boy and here you are you given my brother a party you you're giving your you're giving it you even giving him gifts brand-new shoes and a ring in his finger even a ring I've never gotten none of those things from you he's complaining while he still had roof over his head well he had servants and he's complaining they he never received none of these gifts none of these things and he had servants people served in that house they served him and he was complaining and this is that's what this that's what these people that they were complaining against the 11th hour workers that's why they reminds me of a man those complainers complainers always complaining about something a man well they're just not doing it exactly the way I like it we'll get over your man it's not all about you amen it's about advancing the kingdom let's let's see what we can all do amen to advance the kingdom of God amen what can we do all of us do we all have a part to play amen you remember when Jesus rebuked John for his intolerance one time in mark chapter 9 verse 38 he said in John answered him saying master we saw one casting out Devils in thy name and he did not follow us he doesn't follow us he doesn't come to our church he doesn't he doesn't believe the message and and we and we forbad him because he followeth not us we told him to stop because he doesn't he doesn't believe the message but jesus said forbid him not in other words don't tell him to stop amen for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name that can lightly speak evil of me for he that is not against us is in our part sunday is on our part amen let's let's not be quick to criticize a man church next door is having a function praise the Lord before our church when they're having an opportunity to hear the Word of God at least John 3:16 hey it's the Word of God I'm criticized we all get we all we all get critical spirits amen and it's something that is it's an attitude that's lacking grace grace is more than you think again and by you being critical it attitude that doesn't have grace in it at all amen but he answered one of them the the parable here almost done but he answered one of them and said friend I do thee no wrong hey I was fair with you I didn't do you wrong they didn't you agree with me for a penny now the the labor the the one that started 6:00 in the morning you'd have to say yes I did agree with you for a penny I didn't do you no wrong take and take verse 14 take dine take that dine is and go your way keep going I will give unto this last even as unto thee now look what he says continue it is not lawful for me to do is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own amen hey God can do whatever he wants to with with with his with with with what's his God can save the worst sinner if he wants to God can do whatever he wants to a man and who are you and my man to to to say God you shouldn't do it this way you can't do it this way now this can't be done this way that's not up to you to decide God's the one that decides that right God's a more gracious God than you and I Oh we'll ever be you won't you don't understand the grace of God until you really experience the grace of God and even then you won't we don't fully understand it is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own this dine i evil because I am good see are you thinking evil because here I am I did something good I gave these 11th hour workers a penny just like you guys got a penny you should be happy that they'd received the same the same that you that you received in other words is what if that's what Jesus was trying to tell them you should be happy but no instead you're not I want this I want us to think about this and consider our lives consider where we're failing it we're failing God in that in those areas grumbling and complaining and not happy when somebody's prospering spiritually when somebody's prospering spiritually amen no matter who it is amen we should be excited and happy amen oh oh well they don't come to church but once a year well praise God they're here praise God they're here to hear the word at least one day hallelujah and treat them that way amen he don't serve the Lord she don't serve the Lord look what they did they did this this and that of the other praise God they're a church amen God's in control God knows that by each and every one of our lives God knows what's best for us he can't deal with you the same way he deals with hair or him you know praise God I hope you know you know what I'm talking about His grace can cover anyone and there is nothing you can say or do about it because you know what Saints is His grace it's not your grace your if it's your grace my good that is probably there's no grace at all but is His grace so he can do whatever he wants to Amen it covers a multitude of sins amen you should be glad that he can show others the same grace he's shown to you amen so then in verse 16 he says so the last shall be first and the first last for many be called but few chosen a man that's the reason Saints that I believe Saints in this hour and I'll just tell you as my personal my personal testimony but here in the last few years and I thank God because God had a purpose for us to come here in this church God had a purpose for you to come here to this church God knew what I needed spiritually amen but in the last few years I believe God has been revealing more things to me than I ever I came to the message in 1999 and I'm not I'm not saying that it's it's bits brother Dale Amen it's the Holy Spirit in the ministry amen I tribute and I thank God I mean but I thank God I thank brother Dale and I think for these brothers here they who submit themselves to the Holy Ghost they meant to give us exactly what we need us food and spiritual in due season they meant well I heard that 20 years ago well you need to hear it again because you don't have grace of God in your life the way you should I know about the grace of God but you need to have learn how to have it on others amen praise God and so Saints that's the reason why the first shall be last unless I hear blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe I was not there at the meetings with the Prophet I did not see now one miracle never shook brother branham's hand I wish I could have shaken his hand I wish I could have been there I would have loved to but you know what's Saints I really believe that brother Branham would right now be cheering for those of us say men who have come up amen and said those those those people really believed the message the message that I preached the message that I preached they're really believing what I'm what I'm saying what I said amen why because though now that message that he's preached is be coming into manifestation in in and God has been doing such a powerful and quick work Amen in these last few years then he has for for the ages of the Christian of the the Christian you know the Christian walk Amen God is doing something quick right now amen and powerful in this hour amen and only those who are gonna be in tuned my man with that Holy Spirit amen are able to and pick it up some of us are still looking back 50 feet 50 feet 36 56 years ago a menace but some of us amen God's doing quick working us and I thank God for that I know praise the Lord so that's why Jesus said the first shall be last and the last shall be first amen the last that we have come in a man here in this late hour a man those of us who really love God and really want to serve God and really want more of God amen we're receiving quick bursts of that word and it's not just for head knowledge but it should be to change us amen more and more into the image of Christ amen it's not for head knowledge not that not not to say that I know more than you or no than that amen you see the labor that brother Dale has had has has had to go through since he came into the message he's labored a lot in the word he didn't have these things that we have nowadays you know now we can get a revelation from God quickly if we wanted to even if he wants to reveal it to us we're back then they used to take hours and maybe days to just find one quote now I'm not I'm not saying that's why Jesus said to first shall be last and the last shall be first that's not that's not a that's not a slam on brother Dale he gets the same grace that I get even that I came in in this last hour amen it's the same God is the same Christ is the same grace is the same forgiveness is the same Holy Spirit amen praise God so those here in the end time Amen seem to be getting it quicker than those who have come in at the earlier time amen which is what we see amen praise God now we see here that just real quick it said that we as the eleventh hour workers have been shown that grace and you know what Saints the closer we get to the top of the capstone the more grace we should be showing I remember that when we read therein in Ezekiel a man that that capstone comes down crying grace grace amen I love grace the fullness of Christ the fullness of the word a man as we're coming up amen that grace should be coming closer amen amen as we're doing our part he's doing his we should be more gracious more than you were 15-20 years ago we should be more gracious hey man we should have more grace in our life and then also for the life of others hey you man because to me that's like a magnet amen that a magnet that headstone is like a magnet when when when when when you when you have a magnet and you have an object that's that can they can be pulled by the magnet the closer you get it to the magnet the quicker is going to get to it so if it's over here it's going to take a little bit longer to get to the object right but if it's closer to it it's going to come to it quicker amen so as we're scaling up a man in the stature of a perfect man amen we should be more gracious we should be reflecting that grace more and more amen praise the Lord that's crying grace grace amen and do you remember Saints and I'll finish with this do you remember the story of Joseph what a story of grace but do you know do you know we all know the story and I'm not gonna go but Matt - I'll just be quickly man but do you know that Joseph was the eleventh son if you count all the sons that were born he was the eleventh one that was born and we know that he was hated by his brethren he was he was he was he was a they hated him by his but his older brothers because he had visions he had dreams he was spiritual and he was very loved by his father and the reason why he his father loved him is because he was the first son of Rachel which his father's was his father's preference Rachel was you know he married both Rachel and Leah but Rachel was the one he'd worked for man for such a long time and here is this first son and he loved him and so the sons the other sons they saw that no and they were jealous and they they ousted him out so much they even sold him to Egypt no grace there and here's this young man 17 18 19 years old how old he was in sold amen and and and had to go through this and came up grew up in this other land in Egypt and he and it's Sean and he's shown Joseph is shown grace by Potiphar because Potiphar takes him in and he works for him and he treats him like his own son and then later on he's shown grace by even Pharaoh himself so Joseph is now acquainted with grace he's fully acquainted with grace but the grace he didn't deserve none of this well he thought there originally when he was thrown into a pit and being sold to these these these people that were gonna buy slaves he thought that that was the end of his life but he sees God is raising him up and it's not just Potiphar showing him grace and it's not just Pharaoh showing him grace but his God showing him grace the whole time amen for a purpose and so here comes Joseph gets married and has all has children and now he's in a position where he's second in command of Egypt and the famine comes in under in the land and here comes his brothers and now he realizes and we all know the story but when it comes time when he asked him about his their younger brother Benjamin now we know Benjamin is a represent a is a representative of the Jew of the Jews of the 144,000 amen so here is Joseph Amen full of grace and really amen he was fighting the whole time because you know in his human ways he wanted he wish he could get back but he knew that he couldn't do that that wasn't the right way amen probably news humans why he thought that so here's Benjamin Amen and he tells his brothers to bring Benjamin and when he sees Benjamin he something happens to him because you realize Benjamin was the second child of his of his mom of Joseph's mom you see all the other children had different mommies and their moms with Leah and in other other other other maidservants that Jacob had children with Amen but Benjamin and and Joseph were born from the same mother Rachel so hid something something happened to him something was special about him and and when they sit down and eat and everything hey the Bible says that he gave him five times more to Benjamin then what he gave them what he gave to his other brethren not that he loved them any less he gave them just the exact same food everything like everybody he just fed him more MORE amen to you Benjamin because he something happened to Benjamin so he loved Benjamin we know the story we see the story and we realized that at the end when he when he shows reveals himself to his brothers who does he hug first who does he kiss first he kisses Benjamin first Benjamin that he shows grace to a person that had not even met Joseph Benjamin had not even met Joseph and yet he has shown all this grace and then later on we if we see that he Joseph shows grace to the rest of his brothers and I but that's just to show Saints that we're supposed to be here in this grace and this grace amen that we are here a men should be spilling over because the same grace that we receive here this in this end time is going to go over to those Jews the 144,000 amen later on praise God exact same grace Benjamin didn't deserve none of those things that he - what did he do same thing with those 144,000 and you know what that really goes to show that those 100 that the first shall be last and the last shall be first because really God was the one who came to to Israel to the children of Israel for the first you remember they rejected him and yet God gives the Gentiles a man shows them grace the first shall be last and the last shall be first and those 144,000 they're gonna come in and they're gonna come in with the same grace and the same Holy Ghost that you and I receive them amen no they're no different the same pay that you and I got that's the same pay they'll get as a matter of fact their grace the grace that even the the the the fifth seal Jew brother Wade has talked about it but the deal is talked about it that's that's grace great unmerited grace my goodness do you see that we don't even understand that the grace of God
