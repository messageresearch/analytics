appreciate brother Dale having a heart to be able to let us to do these things let us do these things they man so it's Psalms 85 verse one and we'll review a little bit keep everybody a prayer we we haven't heard any more about brother John LaFontaine but he's he's had open-heart surgery and blockages and all that so he's had a had a rough times we'll keep him in your prayers so let's bow our heads the Heavenly Father we pray Lord tonight that you would speak to us Lord not by just being a God that stands alone somewhere but Lord you're your now you're with your people your people have gathered together to hear from you Lord not to hear from a man but to hear from you father and I pray that you would take the words that are being said you speak the words you'd be the one that does the speaking father and you're the only one that can do the revealing we can talk as much as we want to all night long but unless you come on the scene and reveal yourself to the people it will do us no good because Paul says the letter killeth but the Spirit added to that letter we'll give it life father we pray that you'd heal the sick Lord brother John and the different ones that we that were praying for their Lord we pray that you'd just be with each one that's sick even here in the building the ones that are getting older Lord that you pray that you'll just comfort them and they're in their troubles and heartaches and trials and you'll be with each one father bless the missionaries on the foreign fields Lord get my fruit for the labor father just forgive us of our sins Lord and show us our position and our here in the waning hours of of the time of this world that we're getting ready to leave and we know the world is going to go on but you said you were going to have a bride because you promised it in your word so there will be someone that'll stand in the end time and say death where is your sting grave where is your victory and we will not have to go to that dark place called the grave father we pray that you would just sanctify the people bless each one in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen Psalms 85 verse one to the chief musician a psalm of the son of Korah Lord thou has been favorable into the land and now it's brought back the captivity of Jacob thou has forgiven the iniquity of thy people now God's words got to come to pass thou has covered all their sins Selah thou has taken away all thy wrath thou has turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger turn us O God of our salvation and caused on anger toward us to cease wilt thou be angry with us forever wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations question mark wilt thou not revive us again that thy people may rejoice in the show us thy mercy O Lord in Brenna's da salvation 2nd chronicles 7 verse 14 will read this and be seated if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves watch these watch these things right here humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their heal their land now mine eyes shall be open in my ears a tenth unto the prayer that is made in this place for now high have chosen and sanctified this house know what we were talking about this out not to brick and mortar this house that my name may and be in there forever in my eyes in my heart shall be there perpetually you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word thank the Lord for all the good things we had during the holidays and thank goodness it so and we can get back to a little more normalcy and and be able to you know this is time of the year when everybody kind of stays home and don't do a lot of vacating and we can get a lot of get a lot of things done and and we thank God that he's give us another year and that we can look on the you know their safety in the Word of God and I was thinking yesterday that and forgive me for a minute but God knows who's gonna make it and who's not gonna make it we don't but if you'll ask God to give you a little insight because we're all living under a prophetic message coming from a prophet thats all things 60 and 70 in 80 years before they happened look at naman yeah he saw what chariots Jocelin in the streets four thousand years before there was ever one car built so God gives people insights sure God send prophets and he sent brother Branham but he didn't take that prophetic he took his prophetic gift of divine healing but not the prophetic gift of being prophetic people being able to see because brother Brown told us we were prophetic people we had prophetic insight so we could see these things and I was thinking the other day you know people say well I just don't know if I can make it well you know what God new year's gonna say that but I'm here to tell you quit saying that you say I'm gonna make it that's what the Word of God says the Word of God says we're going to make it somebody and that's why I was thinking the other day you know God there's an eternal strand that goes all the way from God all the way through I mean it doesn't end we must if we're attached to that what have we got to worry about if we attach ourselves to that he tell you say you you say no you're yeah we predestinate from the foundational world God knew exactly where we would be but you don't that's the free moral agent part of man that man can be a free moral agent and how much more do we praise God being a free moral agent instead of just going and being beat into it or being whipped into doing something amen so let's give ourselves all this year we're talking about a revival and we know that since we've been talking about it it's got to start with you I'm gonna read you another prayer that sister Esther is not here tonight but she had she's got her own a refrigerator sister Smallwood and she gave it to me and I'm gonna use it tonight I think we ought to all put it on our on our refrigerators because it becomes a revival we think well if brother Mark would just get in line we'll have a revival let maybe so but he's got to say that our problem is as we point our finger out there - well if brother Bob would quit doing let me let me read you this prayer in just a second I'll tell you what a prophet did a prayer for us but it was a prayer for itself all right let's go to the Hebrew lexicon and see what remember because revived is not resurrection resurrection is you are dead if you are not born again today you are dead you are dead but we want to be dead in Christ so the Bible says the dead in Christ shall rise first if you're dead in Christ today you are born again amen but this is a revival of what you already have I want us to go through and look at the things that you already have we ought to thank God for the things we already have and then not for what's coming we know what's coming according to the Bible but we don't know exactly what tomorrow is but we know the guy that holds tomorrow so revival then get away from revival being a resurrection resurrection is sure we want to get people saved we want to get them sanctified we want to get them fold with the Holy Ghost as we were talking in the youth Bible study or the Youth Bible study the question came up about communion communion is communing with God and it's a very intimate thing and if you don't take communion that tells you one or two things I was telling the kids it's that divining dividing time in that defining moment when somebody walks up in front of you and hence you the the bread and the wine and you don't partake of it there's a problem there all Christians take communion all right if you're born again you will take communion you say well I've got forget all that if you're born again find out first even if you have a problem brother Brown said take the communion but go make it right take the communion but don't make it right and if you're born again you will go make it right so see it all goes back to that and and I don't want it to be something to where it's a embarrassing moment but if you don't take communion then then it's just got to be this you're not born again the same way we're like what time I coming to church and doing all these things it just tells us it defines our life so now let's look at revival it says to live have life remain alive sustain life and what do we say a revival meant it meant water what is this that you know you can do without food some of us good for a while but we can't do without water you can't it's only like seven days you can do without something liquid but now you can do without food so we want to remain alive or Sisto which so we want this revival to be a sustaining revival we want it to be something that when you get up in the morning put your feet on the ground you've already been the victor so there's a lot of people didn't make it through that evening and here I'm coming close to 60 years old and I see that more than ever yet another man was talking today he looked at me and he said he's a lot of people not made it to 60 years old I said there's millions of people never made it to your age you are even you young kids there's millions of people never made it to your age why are you still here why's God still doing things why he's not finished with you when God's finished with you I want the book folded and I want to go the house but when he's dead he's not done with me yet so I'm just going to keep on going but and that's what just sustains us is that revival that we have in our life and I'll read you something a little bit later about brother Brown talks about things becoming common in becoming plain we don't want that to happen we want we want to have that little spark all the time all right to live to have life remain alive sustain life live prosperously now that doesn't always mean that we live in a 5,000 square foot house no that doesn't mean that you can live a prosperous life and be a pauper look at Lazarus membered the one that was in the bosom of Abraham he was a pauper and the rich young ruler was the one that was in hell all right so live forever be quickened be alive be restored to life and health to continue in life and remain alive you say well that now that to me that doesn't mean normal natural life that means stay alive in God because I'm going to tell you something those that are in that six dimension now are more alive and God than me and you are amen so that we got to quit looking at that we're more alive because we're no that just means you can breathe that just means you still got part of your human faculty here they're over there breathing an eternal air amen but to get them here you and I are gonna have to be quickened to a point that's never been quickened before that's what we're gonna try to get to it and it's a requirement it's a requirement because we're going to look in a few minutes about the church ages there were requirements in each church age and we're going to look at them and we're going to see how their revival died because the revival died God sent somebody to revive what they had fallen from amen and listen when there's a rebuke in this Book of Revelations when there's a rebuke to these Church ages it's not a rebuke to the world it's a rebuke to the Christians that have fallen away as brother Dale's bringing out so graciously and wonderful about that seed that seed is the children of God children of the kingdom church his word of God we know that but why does he say he says well that's the children of the kingdom he's talking about me you that Satan took your joy away from you but he can't have it the joy of the Lord it's my strength amen I don't want him to have any joy I want him to be the most miserable person that ever lived the only problem is is we laid him in here and there both of you that way true but let him be miserable but I'm not going to be miserable alright so let's look at this the next one number one this is the first prayer oh wait a minute let's go to Hosea we got to go to the promised coming let us return into the Lord for he hath torn and he will heal us he has smitten and he will bind us up after two days will he revive us promise of God must come to pass God's Word has to come to pass it couldn't during those two days come as this is coming here he will revive us in the third day he will what raise us up and we shall live in his sight showing the resurrection in that third day alright the deity of Jesus Christ number one this is the first prayer that that we showed brother Branham he's praying here now watch now start a revival in the hearts of the people this morning this is in 1949 and I want you to see how in 1964 brother Branham now watch what he's doing in this he says now start a revival in the hearts of the people look at me in the hearts of the people bring a revival in the hearts of the people this morning Lord made us be a renewing time a time when the Spirit will be renewed and Oh father we'd pray it this way come get us by the hand each one of us and walk us down this Lane here show to us this great picture that said in order here revealing your secrets to the Saints hearts this morning that we might see once out just before us as we walk down Lord in the armor of God may we go as gallant soldiers to face the enemy but how could we face him unless we know his tactics and keep us this morning to understand the show is for four grounds there so we'll know where to meet him for we ask it in Jesus name hey man that's 1949 hang on a minute we're not done 1964 this is the one that that sister Esther brought to me I'm pretty sure I had it in my notes of the 1,200 quotes that I've gotten but but what's this now watch brother branham is not talking to the congregation 1949 he said we he said us the people listen to this prayer 1964 God created me I circled every one of these a revival let me be the revival let each one of us be the revival the revival in me make me Lord that's our problem we look at everybody else's problem that means you're the problem sorry make me Lord to hunger make me to thirst create in me Lord that what is needed in me let me from this hour own be done more consecrated servant talking about itself a better servant this is 1964 the seals have already broke he's at the end of his ministry and he still tenth want God he's talking personally to God I created me more able more humbler more kinder more willing to work more looking to the things that are positive and forgetting the things that are in the past that's what brother Nate was talking about Sunday and Saturday and the negatives if we keep hanging on negatives you're not gonna get anywhere let me press toward the mark of the high calling of Christ amen that's on my refrigerator because it's nice talking about me I'm not talking about Jim know about me amen make me Lord make me a better servant Lord of Mercy make me created me of revival let me be the River who was what was a Welsh revival where's the Welsh revival mr. policeman he said looking at it you know what brother Bram used that over and over so it must have been true that revival was in that policeman that was walking down the road can it being us but now look at number three but how does this come about the angel of the Lord 1951 and when we see these crowds gathering that doesn't mean we revival that's just the gathering but a revival is when people get really right with God and pray through we were talking about Sunday school and different ones there in Bible study the reason that we know we have the Holy Ghost is what one thing the Bible tells us sighing and crying for the abomination done in the city sign and crime for the abomination done in what's going on in the message and then but you got to go back to personal let me start the revival let me be the one that it starts in that policeman was so proud that that Welsh revival was in him not in his neighbor but if it's if it was in his neighbor and his neighbor neighbor confessed it what a revival but remember it's not going to be a revival of putting up tents and the music's not going to get you know we're not gonna hire a worship team to come in you know and try to get some of y'all alive so maybe - raise your hand put a little bindi on your arm raise your hand and when you see these crowds gathering that doesn't mean revival that's just the gathering but a revival when the people get really right with God and pray through Bob cry for that boy pray through cry for your children have you ever prayed through for your kids get desperate we're just not desperate enough and pray through and start a revival throughout the city but I'll promise you one thing Bob was sending me a message today and we'll talk about that later but you know I thought well you know if it's like me you you pray without ceasing you we've all got our little things that we you know we can sit somewhere but let's don't make it so cath late to where we gotta you know sit down and put the cross in front of us and no you to pray through would be you could be driving down the road and just praying through you know I mean that's to me that's some of the best prayers especially when you're driving and people want to cut you off from the road you start praying that the Lord will help you get through but you start you think about your family and you think about these different things that were that we're dealing with in life I'm talking to you as a family you deal with things in your life you got to deal with them personally you got us you got you know I can't I can't sign Cry 4 for Caitlin Zoe as much as I wouldn't Deanna our my own daughter my son why because they're not mine but I still cried and pray for them - okay well that's why we need to do you say well what do we need we need to pray more read our Bible more brother branham's to get closer to God reads the Bible and pray and I will include listening to a few messages if you don't mind amen start a revival throughout the city and everything you see they put away sin put away their iniquity turn to God turn around and start back again alright looking number four now what is a revival it's just a stirring up of what you already got now listen we should have a coffer fall of the truth I'm telling you but the letter will kill you if you don't bring it from here to here it's not stirring up this it's stirring up what's in here amen sure I know it's got to drop down we know that we know it's connected but still a revelation comes from your heart not from your brain amen it comes from your heart not from up here I wished everything up here was quickened down here but not yet but it's going that it's getting there if you're what open yourself up and let God do it so we want to just start what we already have number five now Minister cannot bring a revival there's no preacher can bring a revival so don't look to me a brother down oh look the Bob just gonna come up here well that's what we think we think well we're gonna have one great message and all of a sudden all of us are gonna start that's not what's gonna happen it's got to start with you guys it's got to start with you and me when I'm sitting here it's got to start with us because the preacher don't have it there's no preacher can bring a revival he doesn't pack it with him and the only thing he can do is just be loyal to God in his word and we believe brother Dale is and the ministry here and the revival has to come by the people in your home in your life now a revival isn't adding new members to the church its reviving that what we've already got we should be able to root being a could perpetual revival in the Word of God that we've had here for the fifty years that we've been in this church and the man some of you may have not been here that long but you know what let month our workers get the same pay eleventh-hour kurz gets us and you know what Freda that makes you happy right I had somebody ask me something several years ago from here and say brother brother Dale brother way like I don't know if I can catch up I've been out for so long make yourself available to God you make yourself available to God he'll fill you up that levinthal worker got exactly the same pay let me read this again God's Word has to come to pass and if you're an eleventh-hour worker you will get your portion the same as the people that's been here just reading what the Bible says all right it's reviving what we've already got number six believe it's now this what we need today is an old fashioned God's tent revival clean up the home clean up the heart get things ready so you see what you got to do we got to clean ourselves up clean up the heart get things ready start a revival in your home and it'll begin at the church preachers don't bring it in his briefcase I wish I wish we could bring a revival and just throw it out all over the but God sends it from heaven to the individuals individuals you could be in a revival right now and your neighbor be as dead as a hammer that's just the way God is number seven getting in the spirit that's the way you get a revival that's when you really get in the spirit of a revival now what is this period of a revival reviving what you already have not whooping it up or something that's been the whole thing everybody's wanting to waiting on this last revival that the bride's fixing the ham and they think it's going to be some signs and wonders and great miracles that's not what this says listen it will come with it have you all been healed in the past ten years ninety percent what a revival most people can't say that but we have been in a revival I just want to help you realize when it comes that's what that's our job is to help you realize I'm in a revival maybe I didn't know what remember I was telling you the other day or we were talking downstairs somebody says well what are we doing here may we wear this and wear that we can't do this we can't do this we can't do that I said look brother branham had a vision of shooting a bear and there was a man there he saw his hand but he didn't see his face and he saw a green check his shirt we know that was brother Bisco right now when brother Bisco tells his story of that he says I put that shirt on he said brother Brown told us the whole thing was going to happen I put the shirt on he said for two hours I walked in that vision for two hours before I looked down and realized there's the bear here's the guy with the green ticket shirt and there's my hand even had a small had a smart member brother on say that small hand he was two hours in a super 9 trol vision and didn't even know it that's what I'm saying we could already be in the greatest revival that you ever been and you just don't know it yet but boy when you do know it what the brother will say he said I knew it was gonna happen then he might have had you know remember he was adapting our brother madam I can see all the way to the horses remember he was the guy I see all the way to them horses they ain't a bear no are you sure brother branham he just and i'm sure brother rams looking at the green checkered shirt and going yeah I'm sure it's gonna happen yeah and him going I don't know brother round brother Ram look at that green taking surgeon I know it's gonna happen Michael he saw the man in the green second sure but the guy was a green checkered shirt that was part of the vision had no clue for two hours and you know what when that bark when that bear pumped up down that Valley I believe brother Briscoe man look down at that green second shirt and said I think he's gonna hit it I think you don't hit that bear cuz you realized where he was that well that's the way it is with preaching the gospel I want us to realize that we've come from somewhere and we have arrived at a position we've arrived at a position that we need to go on with God just a little more going a little more with God go up a little come up higher we're in that third day period amen all right in your home in your life what number in my own seven all right look don't whoop it up or something but by praying it down until there's a revival strikes what your heart not hear your heart until all the logs of Ecclesiastes amol the logs the fanaticism all the logs of system and all the logs of unbelief flow out excuse me and then the waters now what's waters revival their revival of God comes falling down upon you not upon the whole group on you all right number eight we'll get down to number nine and then we'll go into the church ages from it excuse me old Christians friend o Christian people bind yourself together with one heart and one Accord for God cannot no more send the gifts to the church while the church is separated that's why we're without gifts were separated right maybe not so much separated with belief but we may have separated ourselves for God cannot no more send the gifts to the church while the church is separated then he can send the Holy Ghost unless you're in one Accord that's right for it comes by the Holy Ghost believe it alright let's go to number nine and then we'll make some comments here that's the reason we can't have a revival you've got to get back to God's faith again in the Bible where men and women become born-again and regenerated by the Holy Ghost then that man can't help from being a Christian he's a Christian by birth you don't have to pledge him give him cards and visit him that's babies you don't have to pledge him give him cards and visiting I'm reading you the prophets quote here if he's born again brother you almost have to bar the door to keep him out hmm you almost have to borrow the door to keep him out of hot wind done that yet we had to but what happens is now they don't have these so they wanted to go and read it in my Bible but if you'll go if you want to go to revelations chapter 2 because what happens at a revival began on the day of Pentecost ad 30 not back we're not talking about zoo the street at the moment but back 80 30 there was a revival come down and you say well no that wasn't yes it was a resurrection but it revived what would they had already held for three and a half years they were a little bit more special than most people they had to word himself tell them and they packed it in his brother down shoulders they took the word and held it and they held it until it was quickened and then what did they do they didn't stay in the upper room they went out and they want manifested what was already inside of them but he had to be quickened first everybody got that say ma'am all right and so they went out to the people they preach the gospel but what happened the zeal began to fall away chapter 2 verse 4 now Ephesus was a mighty Church they did not have a doctrine of a false baptism they did not have a trinity to worry with they did not have an eternal hell to worry with they didn't have all these doctrines that we have now to worry with they were the pure Church nevertheless verse 4 I have somewhat against thee now he's not talking to the world he's talking to the bride he's talking to the bride of that age you have got away from your first love and that was just a very short period of time from ad 30 of course John wrote this in 1896 but the efforts in church age started back in eighty fifty something or thirty something all waiting to fit something okay you have already remember therefore from whence thou has fallen and repent and do the first words we're going to cover this more Sunday what's the first words the works you started with clean up the home do the right thing communion foot washing what about ISM make sure that's all right make sure you're doing those things but if you don't I'm going to come quickly and remove that count state in other words he's going to remove your joy just like brother Dale was talking about Satan is going to come in and he's going to what grab your joy he's gonna pull it right out of you that's not a revival no no we want a revival to keep going and you know what God did keep going because even though he said emphasis you've fallen away from you first love but nevertheless we're going to continue on but see verse 6 but this thou hast thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans which also hate so he told them you've fallen away from your first love but there are some things I like about you a man that ought to make you happy and it's not something your neighbor thinks it's good about just what God says good about you ma'am all right now let's go to chapter 2 verse 9 and this is the smyrna church age i know thy works and tribulation and poverty but thou are rich and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and or not we're at the synagogue of Satan fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer behold the devil cast something in the prison you may be tried you'll have tribulation 10 days be thou faithful unto death and I'll give you a crown of life all right but remember there's a church age all right if I should have brought my shark because we remember the chart we did with the poured room we've been through it about the church age messengers where the porter stands in the gap because remember each church age should lap over it's not Church ages like this if you hadn't will make all over it again for those who knew we got a lot of new people but but there was there was a church age messenger remember the Holy Ghost came under their Pentecost let me just run through it real quick Holy Ghost came under their Pentecost that was the messenger to the Pentecostal age amen then Paul comes at the end of that Pentecostal age and brings his message to Ephesus well those Pentecostals started getting away from their first love God put a profit on the scene what to call them back to revive them sure they was people got born again but you know what listen when you see those circles out through there they brother Branham drew remember they're not separated thank you I love them guys back there here's the Pentecostal age Paul comes at the end of Pentecost brings his message as we preach here but what happened Paul was a messenger give a message when off the scene what's the first thing happened they started falling away now as they fell away now look hold on a minute this is not really correct remember they went people got born again with Paul and all of a sudden nobody else got born again until Iran has come on the scene that's not true God's always had bride on the face of the earth since the day of Pentecost there's never been a day when there hadn't been a bride on the day of pending I want since the day of Pentecost amen so that's really not correct but brother Bram said they lap over like this there's a lap over because what happens is look at the curvature they start going down God sends a porter which is Irene yes he didn't send Iranians over here he's seeing Irina sin the first of the church age everybody got that thing man all right there was a porter or one standing at the door to introduce Christ to the people and Irina says aids you can read it in the Bible they come and had a great age but then what happened at the end of the age that was a falling away they needed a revival that wasn't they needed more Christians they needed to revive what was already there so they come into a revival now that Martin comes on the scene right here brings his message to the Pergamon church age they do the same identical thing a band flow a band flow because you can read it let's read the next one verse 14 of that same this will be the pergamene church age I know that works we're thou dwellest even where Satan's seat is but look but I have a few things against thee just a few let's don't throw the baby out with the bathwater just a few things I have against you let me tell you something real quick I'm talking to all of you you better be quiet about what you say about your brother and sister I'm telling all of you because you in trouble with God brother Brown stood and he called them people Rickey's and Rick Evans for about three years I got the quote right in there God said you shut up those are my people and man am I telling you what brother what I told brother branham about him calling Ricky's and Rick at us he said those are my people they're just caught in a system you know what he was telling them he said you'd be quite because they're boarding in people out there you better be quiet about what you say about your brother and sister there's only one judge I'd just be careful you might get you candlestick pulled out but I have a few things against thee thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam huh it crept in the church but God allowed it memory is not talking to the world where did it creep into it crept into this perk of me in church age that's why I did what no it wasn't a big surprise that we got all these doctrines in the message it's happened since the dawn of time remember who was that Sorrenti us in the first church age was preaching that Jesus was a light substance of God just like the preaching now that Jesus wasn't gone to the River Jordan same devil different name remember those demons don't die they just hop and skip right through the church ages and man and sadly into the church all right just sort of something but I'll hold it tight IRA look at verse 19 to verse 19 I know thy works and charity and service and faith he he gave them the message of the hour their message of the hour but look at verse 20 notwithstanding I have a few things against thee now listen he didn't throw the age out he didn't throw the Christian people out he didn't throw the born-again he didn't throw his sons and daughters out but he did give them a rebuke by the Word of God by a preacher men not women because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel you let her come in and try to run the church it's exactly what that says cuz now suffer what did you guys about one of those she want to take over she wanted to kill the true people of God she wanted to take over which calleth herself a prophetess oh I got the message I've been here for 50 years better be careful to teach and seduce what my servants to commit fornication and eat things sacrificed I'll that's what they had to put up with and I put the church ages back up here I gave her a place to risk repent and she repented not that was the problem that was a separation she didn't repent but the rest of them did go back to here now so we see that in each of these ages God brings a message and a messenger what at the end of the previous age so this is where the falling away sad the falling away is not here though that's a revival here the the trees growing all they're bringing people in and this new message of Martin is coming in and he's bringing but then what happen the devil gets in the church and starts driving it back down so what happened all the way down to the Holy Ghost coming the same way as it did at Pentecost there had to be profit come at the end of the Pentecostal age go see that was an important age that was the pure Holy Ghost falling on believers hundred twenty the upper room in 3000 downstairs which started Christendom which started the church ages but then we come down to right here and remember brother Branham was the one to put that light right there the angel blacked it all out he said I added that little bit of light so the Holy Ghost come we're on Azusa Street to restore the gifts at the end of Wesley's age no messenger to the aged brother Branham wasn't a messenger to penticoff just as Paul wasn't a messenger depending off Paul was a messenger to the fees in church age brother Branham comes at the end of the Pentecostal age and brings his message now remember this man's special these people have one thing to do bring a bride rebuke the world and break a plague on the earth now brother Branham is a little bit different because there's no other Church age that this is going to fall away and then we're going to go back into the same thing again so brother Branham he said this messenger of Malachi forced to do two things number one turn the hearts of the white children children babbling Pentecostal babies trying to grow them up in God back to the faith of the fathers which is where's the faith of the fathers right here restore it back to here and then bring his message the second part of his message which was the seals and that put brother Branham in this slot here to preach us right on into eternity amen he restored all the way through here to remember he said I'm not the best you've led to see if he was he would be right here he's not there he's out he come at the end of the age just real simple excuse me all right let's go let's leave that up but you see what God holds this pattern let's skip over here just a little bit want to be too long let's go to chapter 3 verse 14 let's go to little layout of scene let's see this is our age so we should know what this is to the Angel of the church and Levison's write these things saith the Amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I know that works that thou art neither : heart now remember in this church age there is no salutation of your doing very good it starts off that you're not doing very well to the angel the church the left sins right these things that the Amen the faithful and true witness the beginning the creation of God I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou wert cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because down slashed I am rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing no absolutely that's already and knowest not that thou art wretched miserable poor blind and naked but brothers and sisters I counsel thee to buy of me by of God gold tried in the fire that thou mayst be rich and white raiment that thou mayst be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that they may see as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent in other words to behold i stand at the door knock If any man hear my voice and open the door remember the door didn't have a knob on the outside the son of man who got put out of the church so it was a man standing there knocking on the door they put brother around him when he started preaching the son of man message that's when they put him out they loved him and all that wonderful thing all the way up to where he comes up to 1963 and he says spoken words original seed in 1962 he says thousands of my friends will leave me why he was bringing a doctrine he was bringing his message that he was supposed to bring being the Elijah of this in town everybody got that seem in to him that overcometh nobody in any church age has got this close to God no one you've got all these different things doctrine of balaam and you've got all these and I rebuke you but I love you and I chasing you and all these different things but look at this one right here this is this is the closest we're gonna get to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me didn't say on my throne it says in my throne Saint John 17 Lord I pray that they are one as you and I are one even as also I have overcome and set down with my father in his throne there was a revival listen this message doesn't need a revival it's the pure message but without you it's nothing so you are the message you bring you bring the revival because brother Ram said as long as it lays on these pages that's what they're doing now because they don't have the Holy Ghost to quicken what's on the pages they're just reading the quotes and going I don't believe that all right I don't think he was there when that happened there I don't think this and I don't think that and he said this wrong and he said that wrong come on people it told us in the Bible what they were gonna do and we still marvel but God's Word has to come to pass doesn't matter if it's the rebuke he's got to come to pass doesn't matter if it's the glory it's got to come to pass but it's you and I our free moral agency that decides where we're at so all God's got this thing figured out yeah he's got to figure it out but figured out because of what you're doing we don't believe in predestination where God puts you in a tube and just pulled you through it do we know he knew what she was going to do go on your way through the tube so he had what he had the word sitting here for you desire it if you desire it he's got the word sitting here you don't desire it then you gonna stand at the dead judgment he's going to say I laid the core I laid the full course seven course meal laughter in front of you and you didn't eat it he was eating crumbs or you was chewing on the only chewing on the plate amen now look go to the next quote now look in the church ages now we know I told you about the Great Awakening that happened in the different in the different times with Luther and Westland we know all that brother Browns told us all that we've come to Luther Wesley of Sankey Calvin Finlay Zuza Street brother Billy Graham all Roberts all these different ones but remember that revival may have saved people and it didn't revive some of the things that they were that they were going through but this revival if brother Branham is correct I'm telling you this not me if brother Browns correct this is going to be a word revival and it will not be a public show so it's not going to be down there in Florida in Orlando where they're having you know 17 straight months of revival the whole world knows that check that one off sure they can listen not seeing anything about them they probably getting people saved they're getting people to live better they're getting people to do what their denomination says but it's not they can't revive the word back into power again this is what we're trying to do we're trying to this word is all-powerful but you and I make it of none effect you and I make it if not effect by the things that we do Jesus stood and said you make the word of none of by your traditions what's our tradition big one brother branham said when the revival comes look what's always come when it come in the days of Jesus just in the minority just a few people look what John had there on the bank John was the greatest prophet that ever hit the face of the earth besides Jesus Christ right you know what Brooklyn and what Jesus said and he had just a handful of people just a few people gathered around from the regions around about to hear him about 99 percent of them rejected his message and walked away yet it was a great revival in a shaking time God shakes things and people don't realize it's being done see God shakes his church the revival is to his church I believe the church is called out now but the thing to revive us is to revive and shake that church to its place again amen you want to know how to shake it let's read this I like this this is neat kind of a long quote if we would all take this approach wake up Jesus Wednesday people come on grief come on wake up your soul is worth more than sleep all right let's read this quote number 11 greatest battle ever fought this guy's name is Peter Cartwright he's a Christian let's get that started right to start with you got it like Peter Cartwright went into a city said Lord told me to come in here and have a revival he rented an old storeroom got in there began to clean it up now this is the Christian man fixing started reliable let's see how he starts it and the big bully of the town the pistol hanging on his sidewalk down got doors some of them said what's that guy doing down there said he's a preacher he's gonna have a meeting he said well guess I'll just have to go down there and throw him out in the street and run him over run him out of here that so we don't want no meeting around here that's what the devil's been telling us so he goes down there stomp the door Peter Cartwright had his coat on you know he was just washing the windows and walk walls down a little bitty fella you know wasn't a linebacker for the whatever a little bitty fella you know the old preacher laughed at him you know for eating chicken with his hands which is etiquette today amen you know so he was just washing the windows and fixing around the big bully walked over pulled his coke back pistol hanging on inside what are you doing oh I'm washing windows and just kept on washing the windows you know he had one purpose listen he had one purpose he didn't care about that guy he had one purpose God told him to hold a revival washing the windows on down I mean this guy was what cleaning his house we don't allow revivals around here oh but the Lord told me to hold this revival see he just kept on out how did this work see see well they said there's one thing you have to understand I run this town around here the devil said he said oh you do and just kept on washing the windows this guy's got a lot of faith he said before you have a revival you got to whip me first little bitty fella this guy had a gun oh I do well I'll just do that next he took off his coat looked over and reached him by the collar and knocked him down the floor jumped on top of him and said I must fight if I should rain I must fight if I should rain increase my courage Lord pounded the tar out of him said you get enough he said yes he got up and shook his hand he got saved that night in church now we know the devil can't get saved but you see what the influence of a man that didn't let circumstances bother him he was washing the windows he went depending on somebody else to clean the house up he was in it and when the devil showed up he just turned around looked at him and said I got a purpose God told me I can have a revival in this building right here in this building right here I'm gonna have a revival and if I got a whip you devil no problem what brother bomb said you know he got that man down and he said kept saying boo devil faith these arms got great big then you know Satan's a bluff let's read number 12 I must fight if I should ring I think we ought to keep that one somewhere I must fight if I should reign increase my courage Lord all right number 12 let's read this and it will be done excuse me I lost you the Prophet 1956 mothers of old they love to raise their children but hold this modern America day that we're living in them I tell you our nation is simply polluted there's not a hope left of this nation as I see only an old-fashioned revival according to the scripture it'll never be nationwide so then we're just left it'll be a revival among the people , the elect of God but it won't be a real sweeping revival take the whole nation in never was never will be so if this thing gets beyond these walls maybe it's in another Church mmm may be able to get out but still I want to have a revival here it's what I told the young people I I don't I don't ever look and see who takes communion unless I'm in ministering the communion not because that's not my business it's not our business to know what somebody says up here in the pulpit with prayer and all this things in our business but I would love that every person in I told them I said we make communion wine for this church mom and dad does and they make it a gallon or two at a time I wish they'd make a gallon every month I don't think they'd mind either I wish we could fill them stack them up this high because if you take communion and if you prayed up you read what the scripture says but if you don't you're eating and drinking come that condemnation to yourself but if you're not you're in the service of God see what I mean young people anybody if you don't take communion that shows you're not where you should be well it shows you where you're not at so do something about it that's why say a communion is a face-to-face but what is communion communion is a face-to-face opportunity to say God I love you my life is as clean as I can get it hey I was just I was just listening you heard that tape brother Brent said I'll have a bride without spot or wrinkle it's up to him to do it but he's gonna do it through me in you so when you stand to take communion if you have no spot or no wrinkle guess what you're standing at a place that God can commune with you right then in there he's so close so that's what communion is coming it's not bread and wine it's a symbol that you can communicate with your lover the Lord Jesus Christ it won't be a real sweeping revival take the whole nation never has and never will be all right now look third seal we've read this and I'm gonna read it again then we'll read one more we'll be finished now that's the reasons today that the revivals that we're supposed to have we have denominational revivals now look we haven't had a real stirring now remember let's go back to the other quotes where he says it's not going to be a whoopin and a hollering and a got it so he's not talking about a whoopin and Hollerin right we have denominational revivals we haven't had a real stirring no no no no sir don't think we got revivals so you can't have a word revival when you got wrong word a word revival see Jesus was the word revival he didn't need a resurrection he was the resurrection but that revival came when he brought what he brought us the word and it caused a revival because that's what that Pentecost lived off of that's what the whole Church ages of lived off of they've lived off Jesus Christ their revival the stirring listen because remember and I and I I want to say this in all honesty you hear people say preachers mostly 90% of them it's 99% of them we don't all see eye to eye okay did Jesus walk up and say sometimes me and my father have a problem did he ever did he ever walk up and say now I've been fighting it out with my daddy back there yeah but let's go a little bit further than him I my father woman when the bride says I and my father are one and these other things the show could pull away who the shuk it stands there and says well that's your idea that's your opinion I don't see it that way there's got to be one right that's why a word revival is a restoring of the word of the son of man I hope you see that's what we're coming to the son of God down through the church ages you could have non quickened word because God can't quicken the Father Son Holy Ghost baptism but he will allow it because of what his children he had Rickey's and ricotta's out there and calling that system hope you understand that he had him out there because Martin Luther was a Trinitarian but God said he was well pleased to dwell in that guy so you got to approach it to where the some of those things were what hidden from man but today the books open folks there's no three different doctrines in the message it's one message one doctrine one way one truth one life other 1 John 17 he said lord I pray that they'll be one as you and I are one no no don't think we got revivals we haven't oh they've got millions and millions of church members but not a revival no where no no the bride hasn't had a revival yet there's been no revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet now you say well there what's that manifestation go back to what he said no whooping and hollering no signs and wonders you got it healing revivals that's not what we're talking about here we're talking about a manifestation that somebody can put the word together and the people can receive the word together and there is the truth and not a bunch of error that's what a word revival is that's what this endtime word revival is it's a reviving of the son of man ministry Jesus Christ so close brother Browne said so close to being on the earth but he's in his bride there's been no revival yet no manifestation of God to stir the bride yes see we're looking for it it will take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again okay that's what's gonna wake us up you say well what are they there's a revelation contained in the seven seals if we preach the other day and what brother Dale has been preaching for 40 years we're gonna get it because God said was going to get it we can look all over and all the bad and all of this is not in the other but somebody's gonna get it it'll take those seven unknown thunders back there what the complete plan of redemption may I say that's the complete plan of redemption which is body spirit and soul right there's the seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again he will send it he promised it and what did what your brother brother George Quinn say God's word has to come to pass he said it and it's gonna have to come to pass and we'll leave you with this one and then we'll talk about it Sunday afternoon this is testimony in scene 1964 then we get to begin to find out miracles isn't taking place no more like they were the sick go home sick it isn't because of God it's because of the lack of the revival among the people there is no revival they sit and listen go home and say well I guess that was pretty good mm-hmm see there's that there is there is not that zeal that's what we're gonna talk about Sunday would come about zeal there is not that something in the people that should be there not saying that you nobody's Christian he's not be Christianizing people there's just something not there you know what it is it's the divine word being revealed and us what taking it in and take your coat off and reaching get him by the collar knock him in the floor jump on top of him and say how much find if I should rain that's pretty harsh somebody were to walk by let go I don't know about them to people but you know Jesus the Prince of Peace stood one day and he said I didn't come to bring peace he said I came to bring a sword I come to bring a division between them people out there and the people in here man the Prince of Peace he is the Prince of Peace yet one day he took and planted a rope we were a bystander we would go that's a mad Jew but what was he doing he was fulfilling the word he even even quoted it he said you've made my father's house I den of thieves he was in the scripture so was Paul Cartwright he was in the scripture I must fight if I should reign that's in the Bible so we got to fight this thing we got to fight everything that's against we got to fight everything that we thought before we got a fight that we might reign extend our feet we must fight listen when we come to the time of the five wise and the five foolish virgins both groups were asleep both groups were asleep read your Bible they all woke up but one group realized they were missing something and they go and look and say we need some oil and that group looks at them and says you've been in this message 50 years may I paraphrase you've been in this message 50 years sitting in the message church and you still say you said now you tell me you ain't got the Holy Ghost well that's what the oil is right oil is the whole ego well we've already used ours up we've done this all these excuses you know what the five why's go find it yourself you've been playing forever how many years we have got our oil now you think boy that sounds bad that's not a real Christian attitude but you know what when it comes to life or death you'll do everything to stay alive those people prepared they got their oil they made sure they had the baptism of the Holy Ghost even though they might have slept but when the cry came out they all woke up but one went in and one stayed here amen we don't want to do that we want to have that revival when God wakes us up we want to make sure we've got plenty of oil for yourself this is a personal you say that's so that's so impersonal I just read you all these quotes where brother Brown said you are the revival an individual is a revival not a great group you by yourself are a revival in yourself but let's make sure we're the wise virgins make sure we got oil pray to God ask the Lord to give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost and even after he gives you the baptism of Holy Ghost say look God don't put me in the closet put me right there and I'm gonna stand I'm gonna be here I want you to feed me I'm just a baby but I want you to feed me I got a big old mouth feed me I may cry but please feed me you know if we come and humble ourself like that instead of looking over everybody else and thinking they're the problem no if you start telling Jenna today if you think somebody else is the problem I'll promise you one thing by the Word of God you're the problem and you're causing this church not to have a revival you show now you sense the one brother Bram said it starts with one and goes to the other well what if it stops checking up town folks it's time to say it's my fault like brother Dale says it's I believe it's my fault mm-hmm if there's not a healing that walks away from this it's my fault I've done something wrong well you gonna blame God I better not you can't blame God when somebody comes here and you open the Bible God's words got to come to pass bites dropped your heel what brother Brent said you ought to drive us into desperation when people are not healed of what they come up here for that's what we should do sign cry sign cry listen sign cry for your family first your lost loved ones I'm telling you right here under my feet there's a hug there are more names on this you know what brother Gary you might have to build us another church he puts you on the spot but really that's a hundred people that I'm expecting God to do something to and they're not all my flesh and blood but I'm telling you your church family is a lot closer than your natural family so let's start acting like that man musicians come but these people on this wall I pray every service save those people Lord right I ain't if you didn't if you not been down to my son's school class go look there's a hundred people or more on the wall with their names and their pictures right here pretty much pretty close to right in here there's a wall and those are your people those are your family those are your husband's your wives your father's your mothers your children your grandchildren pray for them but pray that God will start a revival in you because like daddy's always said and I agree and we live a hound dog life in front of our kids wanted in the world do you think they want different what you've got dear kids see you and don't tell me they don't see you do something off or whatever and not real Christian like and start you know doing hey stand out of church you stay out of church you worried about your kids being in church how you gonna pray that people how you gonna pray I want my kids saved God Oh will you church Sunday oh oh okay your kids watch you folks I'm telling you they watch you they want to see your conviction and when your conviction goes wrong they're still out there you know they're still out there why because your convictions not what you say it is let's sing a song revival started in me and you started in us all the souls are anchored in Jesus that storm the wild Capri anchored in Jesus no wind or wave are anchored in Jesus for he has policies Oh Frank early in the Rock of Ages he keeps my soul from emo gives me molested peace listens his voice is still the water landed there to mote sees my pilot and deliver to him I all can file for always when I need him he's at my side maker in Jesus the storms of life are a banker in Jesus I fear no wind or wave while anchored in Jesus for he has how to say I've acre in the Rock of Ages he is my friend and Savior in him my anchor chasms he drives away my sorrows and shields me from the past my faith I'm looking upward beyond life throw see they're robbing Jolla Haven prepared for me of acre in Jesus the storm drain I've anchored in Jesus a fear no went away I'm anchored in Jesus for he asked all the same I Bank early in a sink or down yes I'll anchored in Jesus the storm to block out rain maker in Jesus I fear no wind away I'm anchored in Jesus for he has power to say I've a courageous fear hath torment what do you fear ain't nothin to fear but fear itself wonder what brother Ernie says fear is false evidence appearing real FPA are false evidence appearing real that's what there is what do you God always say that's right what's the first thing he said when he met Adam fear not what's the first thing he said when he met disciples fear not what's the first thing the angel said to brother round fear not all the things because he wanted to take away that fear sure there's a holy reverence when you meet God but there it should take the fear away listen Adam had a problem conversing with God because of what he did but now you and I are supposed to come boldly to the throne now who's sitting on it God Almighty sitting on that throne and he said come boldly to the throne you know why we don't we have sinned that's so easily beset us Paul said us run the race with patience and that's what God's been he is a patient God because look how long he's let this thing run but folks is coming down to a trying time brother Brown said it would be a Razors Edge between truth and error razor's edge that's pretty that's pretty thin a razor's edge but we're anchored in the Word of God we're anchored if we stay anchored then we'll be fine have a good day tomorrow have a good day Friday the whole mines are clear we will dismiss go with God pray for this weekend it's supposed to be some real bad storms so we're gonna pray that they won't be here amen on Saturday and Sunday so let's just let's just bow our heads and and be dismissed Heavenly Father we thank you Lord that you've given us an opportunity to talk to the greatest people that ever walked on the face of this earth the bride of Jesus Christ in the end time we're in this building someone I believe will stand and say death you have nothing in me or for me because we stand as Paul Cartwright and says I must fight if I sure reign Lord this is a battle the greatest battle Lord we think of the other day we were thinking of the great world wars in the wars and campaigns of Napoleon and Alexander the Great and then we come up to the great Civil War Lord those wars are talked about in history they're still talked about among people there they're ingrained in our history the Revolutionary War in world war one world war two all these great wars that men have fought but this is the greatest battle that's ever been fought and that's the Battle of the mind between God as brother Chris was talking about between God and Satan well who stands between God and Satan we do and you will be victorious because your word said you were going to be victorious you will be victorious to a bride a little bride that's God in human flesh on the face of the earth Lord we must realize who we are and what we're doing here and our purpose for making it to this part of our life what revealed that show each and every one of us Lord that we are are we are in that vision that we may not realize it at the moment but Lord let us have a day of of Revelation to where we look down and see that we have on the green shirt and that we were part of that vision and then we know and in our heart as brother Bissell said I know that vision had to come to pass because it didn't it would not fail Lord you'll never fail us but we sure will fail you but I pray that you'd just forgive us of our faults heal the sick give us a revival Lord that this building can't contain be with us Lord take care of us until we come back Sunday bless our pastor keep him safe Lord keep us all safe on the highways be with us Lord on the way home give us this day our daily bread father we believe we've we have had communion with you tonight and we pray that you'd just be with us now and continue continue this communion all the rest of our days of our life in Jesus name we pray a man you're dismissed god bless you my lord movies all the movies on my lord to move his own I can hear the roaring in the mulberry tree and I know I know the movies
