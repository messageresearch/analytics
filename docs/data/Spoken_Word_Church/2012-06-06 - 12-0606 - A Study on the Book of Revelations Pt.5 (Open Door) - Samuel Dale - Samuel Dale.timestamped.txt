[0:07] oh
[0:25] hey
[0:51] um
[1:06] pray for me my throat is a little
[1:08] scratchy but this has been requested by
[1:09] several people from here so hope someone
[1:12] gets a blessing
[1:33] when i come to your presence
[1:48] the vastness of your worry
[1:56] beauty
[2:10] oh
[2:48] when i come into your presence
[3:06] the wonder of your lovers
[3:21] me
[4:24] oh
[4:43] oh
[5:33] oh
[6:02] i want to see
[6:08] i want to see
[6:27] i want to see
[6:58] shining in the light of your
[7:08] holy
[7:41] during what we've been reading from
[7:42] revelations 1
[7:47] 1-3 we use this scripture every time and
[7:49] then we go on
[7:51] speaking on the study of the book of
[7:52] revelations
[7:53] this will be part five so we
[7:57] i don't reckon there's any
[7:58] announcements to be made
[8:01] it's not already made we had an
[8:04] opportunity today to go up and to see uh
[8:07] ricky peterson there they've got him in
[8:09] jail
[8:10] and uh it doesn't look good for him
[8:13] because he's facing some time
[8:15] on
[8:17] some accounts you know but uh
[8:19] we just pray that the lord would make it
[8:22] work out
[8:23] because he'd already done some things
[8:25] and all because he you know they had him
[8:27] in in
[8:28] lockup and uh when nobody's supposed to
[8:30] be able to see him and
[8:32] and everybody was trying to but nobody
[8:34] couldn't get in but
[8:36] the lord had a way of working it out and
[8:38] i was able to go in today and be able to
[8:40] talk to him and
[8:41] and they said that
[8:43] that wasn't supposed to be in but
[8:45] lord knows how to work everything out
[8:47] and take care of it we give him all the
[8:49] glory and the honor and everything for
[8:51] all the whole thing because he'll work
[8:53] out things for him
[8:54] and all and i just told him you know to
[8:56] try to be as best as he could and we'd
[8:59] do all we could and nobody couldn't get
[9:01] in to see him you know they're nothing
[9:03] until they make their final hearings and
[9:05] all of the different things on it so
[9:07] just pray for him lord bless him
[9:10] and uh take care of him and maybe
[9:12] they'll break the sentence down
[9:14] from what they were talking about and
[9:16] that's the main thing
[9:18] is to get him into that position so you
[9:20] just pray for him he needs your prayer
[9:22] that's the last thing he said today just
[9:24] tell the church to pray for me and i
[9:26] said we'll certainly be doing that so
[9:29] you know may the lord touch him and all
[9:30] my cat all right revelations 1
[9:34] heavenly father we thank you lord for
[9:35] your loving grace unto us we thank you
[9:37] for you
[9:39] we pray that you would just bless us now
[9:40] with your understanding and your
[9:42] presence and your love lord
[9:44] let your light shine in each one of our
[9:46] hearts and lives
[9:47] forgive our sins cleanse us lord from
[9:50] all unrighteousness
[9:51] and we just ask you lord to god each one
[9:54] of us be with
[9:55] but brother rick there lordly
[9:57] got him there in jail but
[9:59] you'll just have to be with him and take
[10:01] care of it you can work out a lot of
[10:02] things that we can't do anything about
[10:04] it
[10:05] but yet you can do a lot of things we
[10:07] committed into your hands believing you
[10:09] lord and just pray that you give him the
[10:11] right attitude and everything while he's
[10:14] tired
[10:15] lord may it be for his benefit because
[10:17] you said in your word all things work
[10:19] together for them that are they called
[10:22] you know we just believe that you you'll
[10:24] work it out have your way now if we read
[10:26] your words you come and speak to our
[10:27] hearts and our lives
[10:29] forgive our sins because that's where we
[10:31] want to stand complete
[10:32] and all thanks lord have your way down
[10:34] god in jesus name
[10:37] amen
[10:39] revelations 1
[10:43] 1-3
[10:45] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[10:47] gave unto him
[10:48] is showing to his servants things which
[10:50] must shortly come to price
[10:52] and he sent in signified by his angel
[10:54] and to his servant john
[10:56] who bear record of the word of god and
[10:58] of the testimony of jesus christ and of
[11:00] all things that he saw
[11:02] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[11:04] hear the words of this prophecy what
[11:06] about just to be able to hear it
[11:10] as a blessing right
[11:12] and keep what about that now to be able
[11:14] to keep those things which are written
[11:16] therein
[11:17] for the time is at hand you may be
[11:20] seated the lord had his blessing
[11:22] we know when we covered our
[11:24] uh sunday that the time is at hand
[11:27] and this is the time
[11:30] this is the time now that it's at hand
[11:33] you know time works to be revealed thank
[11:35] you brother you know so we we're looking
[11:38] forward to that because we believe it
[11:40] and know you know
[11:42] now we've been speaking on
[11:46] the book of revelations and this was a
[11:47] lead up to where we can get up to
[11:49] revelations 5
[11:51] and all and i've told you that if you
[11:53] listen very carefully
[11:55] and apply the things
[11:57] that we talk about
[11:59] that you'll find out that when we get to
[12:01] revelations 5 it won't be a
[12:04] uh you know it will already be
[12:06] understood
[12:07] because we've already covered it but we
[12:10] just want to cover it you know up to
[12:12] that place and and all and you know to
[12:15] try to move on in the lord
[12:17] and uh you know i spoke on these things
[12:20] before
[12:21] but we have new ones with us and we too
[12:24] i wanted to lead up to that point to
[12:26] speak to you on revelations 5.
[12:29] so read that over and over read
[12:30] revelation 4 revelation 5 and just you
[12:33] know get familiar very much with the
[12:35] scriptures and the things to where we
[12:37] can see all right now we see that
[12:41] kind of just review up to where we are
[12:45] on the book of revelations that we see
[12:48] that your brother
[12:50] anderson can go ahead and pull up number
[12:52] one
[12:53] we read this the other day
[12:55] but
[12:56] it is not only look
[12:59] now the uncovering is not only the
[13:00] revelation this is page 13 church age
[13:03] book
[13:04] it's not only the revelation of the
[13:06] person of christ
[13:08] but it's the revelation of his future
[13:10] works in the oncoming seven church ages
[13:14] all right so then the book of revelation
[13:16] then is the bride's book amen
[13:19] it is written specifically to you and i
[13:22] haven't to worry that we can look down
[13:24] and see where we're at
[13:26] and you know he didn't leave us with
[13:28] just churchology amen and the writings
[13:32] of the apostles and things there and
[13:34] then you know it went down through the
[13:36] ages and just slipped away and and got
[13:39] into churchology and had to say those
[13:42] words that way but
[13:44] he didn't leave us that way
[13:46] he sent us a prophet in the end time to
[13:48] be able to understand and
[13:51] he began to speak on these things to to
[13:54] get us to understand the entire bible
[13:56] not just the book of revelation
[13:59] but now remember what a point i've been
[14:00] trying to make
[14:02] that
[14:05] you won't find in the book of
[14:06] revelations the lord jesus actually
[14:09] standing by himself
[14:12] you find him
[14:13] with the bride
[14:15] in the bride you could find him
[14:17] revealing himself to the bride because
[14:19] that's what he's doing to you and i
[14:21] and that that is it but it's not
[14:23] something to look at and i wanted you to
[14:25] read that one that that it's not just
[14:27] the revelation of jesus christ
[14:32] it's the revelation of his works or in
[14:34] other words what he's going to be doing
[14:37] all right now we went through
[14:39] revelations 1
[14:41] and showing the symbolics and the things
[14:44] that we were speaking about
[14:46] and covering revelations 1
[14:48] and it was the revelation that god give
[14:50] to jesus to give to john
[14:52] about what
[14:54] about the ages and the things
[14:56] right the ages had not transpired at the
[14:59] time
[15:00] but he you know
[15:02] he gave him the revelation to bring to
[15:04] john about the ages
[15:06] and the point i tried to make to you
[15:08] this i've always tried to make this
[15:09] point
[15:10] that if you can read revelations 1
[15:14] then you can see how beautiful a picture
[15:16] that god has given of the bride
[15:20] before he ever even started writing any
[15:23] of the things that is in chapter two and
[15:26] three
[15:27] and see we read those things and we read
[15:29] the bad things about us
[15:31] you know the things we do and have done
[15:34] all right that's all right it should be
[15:36] done and covered to get out but the main
[15:39] thing is he shows how perfect we are
[15:42] before he ever started writing about the
[15:44] ages
[15:46] now i mean that to me is a wonderful
[15:48] statement that's really been a part of
[15:51] my life for many many many years because
[15:54] i spoke on this for i don't really know
[15:56] how long up into the at least the 30s or
[15:59] close to 40 years
[16:01] speaking on this point and it just
[16:03] doesn't it unfolds to me every day
[16:06] talking about it reading about it it's
[16:08] just that much greater
[16:10] you know to understand all right
[16:13] but now
[16:15] we come up to seeing that that we talked
[16:17] about the bride form
[16:19] and we talked about revelations uh 1 13
[16:23] there you know where he's standing in
[16:25] the midst of the seven golden
[16:26] candlesticks one like unto the son of
[16:28] man gerd about the pouts
[16:31] with a golden girdle and we saw that was
[16:34] the
[16:34] description of the lord jesus christ
[16:38] in
[16:39] his bride
[16:41] down through the ages now not just the
[16:44] first age
[16:45] or not just the last days that's right
[16:49] all right
[16:51] that's what we want to take the alpha
[16:53] and the omega yeah and try to make some
[16:55] great revelation and i've heard
[16:56] preachers even preach these alpha amigos
[16:58] nothing in between
[17:00] we brought around cities alpha and amigo
[17:02] and everything in between if he is the
[17:04] alpha and he is the mega that would have
[17:06] covered all in between that's right you
[17:08] know that wouldn't wouldn't be any
[17:10] problem but i've heard that
[17:11] preached on
[17:12] but now
[17:14] listen we saw him in bribe form
[17:18] down through the entire seven church
[17:20] ages
[17:23] one like unto the son of man
[17:25] and i hope you caught on to what i was
[17:27] saying earlier sunday that you would say
[17:29] well lutheran didn't understand those
[17:31] things no but they're part of it that's
[17:33] right right
[17:35] you're gonna say they're not part of the
[17:36] revelation
[17:38] well you just whacked your legs out
[17:39] under you
[17:41] that's right right
[17:42] right see if you say they don't have
[17:44] anything to do with it you just wiped
[17:46] yourself out because we had to have that
[17:49] for reformation right before you can
[17:52] talk a restoration
[17:54] that's right
[17:55] so then they're part of it and it was he
[17:56] was in the
[17:58] midst and miss means middles
[18:01] well how could you draw as i said sunday
[18:04] how could you draw the seven church ages
[18:06] and put him in the middle
[18:08] that would mean he's in the uh fourth
[18:10] church age
[18:12] he wouldn't be in the rest of it
[18:14] in fact you're a little wordy you know
[18:17] he's in the midst of the seven golden
[18:18] gate but it doesn't mean it like that
[18:20] he's not standing in the midst he's in
[18:23] all the church ages
[18:25] that way he's in the midst that's right
[18:27] all right
[18:28] you see that way we don't look at him
[18:30] for
[18:31] being something in one age and something
[18:33] else in another we look to the unveiling
[18:36] of the word
[18:37] that's right
[18:39] now what a wonderful thing
[18:41] to be able to say
[18:43] that we can before we would even start
[18:46] the ages then we can see what god has to
[18:49] say about us
[18:54] why would we worry then when the
[18:55] scripture would say be therefore perfect
[18:59] amen even as your father in heaven is
[19:01] perfect
[19:03] why would we be concerned we're trying
[19:05] to figure out how to cop to accomplish
[19:07] that right
[19:11] if
[19:13] if we are part of
[19:18] you know the bride
[19:20] then if you see any part of the bride
[19:22] you see the bride and
[19:26] if you see any part of the bride
[19:28] you see the groom
[19:30] that's the point i'm trying to make
[19:31] that's the thought i'm trying to get
[19:33] across to each and every one of us
[19:36] to look at
[19:39] and find ourselves
[19:42] in the book amen but i know where we
[19:44] come from i know the the thoughts we had
[19:49] we had thoughts like oh if i'd have just
[19:51] been back there in paul's age i could
[19:53] have seen myself
[19:55] well see this this is the greatest stage
[19:57] of amen
[19:58] right that's right it's more descriptive
[20:02] uh what is the word i guess descriptive
[20:04] more more describing
[20:07] of the bride of christ
[20:09] in the book of revelations
[20:12] than there is in all the rest of the
[20:14] bible put together right amen so where
[20:17] we can see ourselves
[20:18] and that's my whole point for us to see
[20:21] all right
[20:23] i told you i said i'm not going to speak
[20:24] on the church ages
[20:27] because you know the individual church
[20:29] age in revelation 2 and 3. we've covered
[20:31] those before
[20:33] and i didn't choose to speak on it
[20:34] because if we can look at revelations 1
[20:40] we can see
[20:43] in revelations 1
[20:45] what is in right
[20:48] that's correct revelations two and three
[20:50] amen all right
[20:51] right right
[20:53] and now get that point get get the
[20:55] thought of what i'm saying because
[20:57] that's the the entire thing of
[20:59] what i'm trying to get across to us and
[21:02] then you'll see revelations 5 and what
[21:04] it really is that's correct
[21:07] brother brother said this is the actual
[21:08] component of revelation 5 he said this
[21:10] is the actual opening of the seal right
[21:12] amen
[21:15] but are we still looking
[21:18] i put things in there once in a while
[21:20] for you to think on
[21:22] are we looking at a
[21:26] a seal or a book yeah come on
[21:31] you know
[21:34] remember the book of revelations has
[21:36] been symbolic
[21:37] amen
[21:41] are we looking
[21:43] it's something like that
[21:45] or are we trying to get what is being
[21:48] said right amen
[21:51] jot that one down yeah all right
[21:54] now so then i didn't choose to speak on
[21:56] revelations two and three
[21:58] of the individual ages
[22:00] because we already see
[22:02] sure
[22:04] we see the bride of jesus christ from
[22:06] revelations one
[22:10] god standing in her midst
[22:13] and she's like unto the son of man
[22:16] amen
[22:18] the girl is not down upon the waist part
[22:21] as the servant it's up on the shoulders
[22:23] or coming around
[22:25] and it talks about gird about the prouds
[22:28] the feminist description right amen
[22:31] see then if we're looking at it like
[22:32] that we can see ourselves there
[22:35] right and we're not trying to figure out
[22:37] some
[22:38] what does this mean or what does that
[22:39] mean right
[22:42] it's the very description of you
[22:44] that's right amen it's a picture of you
[22:46] and i right
[22:48] see we're going to talk about it we will
[22:50] get back to this later on another point
[22:52] but
[22:53] see the book of revelations is written
[22:55] in symbolics
[22:56] that's why it took a prophet you know
[22:58] symbols right
[22:59] symbols
[23:01] candlestick
[23:03] like a son of man right you know
[23:06] the different things it's written in
[23:08] symbols
[23:09] but we've had a prophet to tell us what
[23:11] those symbols are that's right
[23:13] all right amen
[23:15] now
[23:16] but are we tied up in
[23:18] trying to
[23:20] understand a symbol
[23:23] instead of seeing that the symbol is us
[23:25] i mean you know it's in us
[23:28] it's working in us
[23:30] what are we trying to do all right
[23:32] so we jump over two and three and we go
[23:34] over to chapter 4
[23:36] and we'll pick that up and
[23:38] and read a little
[23:40] so this just jump over there and let's
[23:42] pick up chapter 4
[23:43] and just
[23:45] look at this
[23:47] and see how beautiful it is
[23:50] now the lord willing sunday we will
[23:52] cover
[23:53] you know trying to get into the point of
[23:55] showing that the bride goes would cover
[23:57] it more the bride going up in revelation
[23:59] 4 1
[24:00] and and not seen until 1921
[24:02] and that's hard for people to comprehend
[24:06] that's right
[24:07] because they automatically would throw
[24:09] quotes they have at me even years ago
[24:11] when i first started uh in a meeting
[24:13] they were taking and
[24:16] handing me quotes you know
[24:18] of uh
[24:19] and say you know well the book of
[24:21] revelations is not in order
[24:24] you know
[24:25] i said well
[24:29] i i can't believe it is myself
[24:32] but i think it's kind of like the uh
[24:35] message i was thinking on the other day
[24:38] on the feast of the trumpets
[24:42] where there's so many statements in
[24:44] there that looks like they're so
[24:45] contrary
[24:46] until a big man in the message said you
[24:49] cannot understand
[24:52] the things to the trumpets i heard his
[24:54] words on national
[24:55] all right
[24:57] now
[25:00] the prophet of god i think i looked he
[25:02] saw said was talking three times i know
[25:05] it's in there one time about that book
[25:07] being thus saith the lord right
[25:10] and i think he covers three times does
[25:11] he have the lord throughout the book
[25:13] now a prophet saying it's thus saith the
[25:15] lord
[25:17] but see we're trying to figure it out
[25:21] you know
[25:22] we're trying to get it one two three
[25:24] four well brother dale that's what you
[25:26] do yes i'm glad you said that i do cover
[25:30] one two three and four
[25:32] but you may have get one here and two
[25:34] over here and three down here and four
[25:36] up there
[25:37] you know when you finality of getting it
[25:39] together
[25:41] because it go it goes that way all right
[25:44] but now look at revelations 4 1.
[25:48] as i said now don't be dealing too much
[25:50] with the thought of of of the you know
[25:53] the do it other than tonight we want to
[25:55] see
[25:56] what it says in the opening verses all
[25:58] right
[25:59] so look what it says
[26:02] after this
[26:04] now we'll read the minute where the
[26:05] prophet said eyes to the church agent
[26:08] correct all right after this i looked
[26:12] and behold a door was opened in heaven
[26:16] they got up on the screen
[26:21] and the first voice which i heard as it
[26:23] were of a trumpet talking with me which
[26:26] said come up hither and i'll show the
[26:29] things which must be here after all
[26:31] right
[26:32] let's just deal only there in the first
[26:35] parts of that
[26:37] revelations 4 1.
[26:40] after this
[26:43] after the church ages sometimes we'll
[26:45] get down to that more sunday
[26:49] but look what john he says
[26:53] and behold a door
[26:56] was opened in heaven amen
[27:02] now
[27:04] remember you're in symbols
[27:10] and in the symbol that's what john saw
[27:16] he looks up to heaven
[27:19] he sees a door open
[27:23] all right
[27:24] now
[27:26] but did he see a door open
[27:31] or did he see the door right
[27:39] which do you see
[27:43] what he said he saw
[27:45] a door was opened
[27:51] now
[27:53] so you're there in symbol see you see
[27:55] the
[27:56] the door
[27:59] all right
[28:01] now this is the question i want to ask
[28:02] you
[28:05] did john see an open door in heaven
[28:11] or did he see the one who is the open
[28:14] door
[28:17] now which did you see
[28:20] you said well we saw the open door
[28:21] that's the symbol
[28:25] right
[28:27] he saw a door that opened that's the
[28:29] problem
[28:31] but that was a symbol
[28:34] now you
[28:37] bring it back down to clarity of
[28:40] understanding or to find out what the
[28:42] symbol is
[28:45] and i just asked my own self a question
[28:48] who is the open door to heaven
[29:00] are we still looking well it was a door
[29:02] open if i could read that
[29:04] that's a symbol that's like a white
[29:06] horse
[29:09] riding off
[29:14] that's like a beast
[29:16] that's like a lamb with silent horns and
[29:18] seven eyes
[29:23] what did john see
[29:27] did he see a door all right right now
[29:30] come on
[29:32] be sensible with me
[29:34] all right he saw a door open he saw a
[29:36] door looked up our door open all right
[29:38] now john remembers a prophet he says
[29:41] okay now lord what am i looking at
[29:45] right
[29:48] he had been through the symbolic forms
[29:50] of revelations 1
[29:53] and saw the things
[29:56] he had been through the the actual uh
[29:59] which is not in symbolics that's the
[30:00] reason i just said we believe it
[30:02] revelation two and three is really not
[30:04] symbolic
[30:06] it's
[30:06] fact it's telling you of the false mind
[30:10] and the true vine
[30:13] all right
[30:14] now
[30:16] so what did john see go ahead brother
[30:19] anderson pull up number two
[30:22] what did john see
[30:26] now this is
[30:28] revelation chapter four part the like
[30:30] part one out of it
[30:31] 1960 1231 paragraph 100
[30:35] through 102.
[30:39] this door said in heaven
[30:42] that door
[30:43] when he looked up he saw
[30:46] the lord jesus
[30:52] no i mean the prophet's answering it
[30:54] right he's the one to interpret the
[30:56] symbolics right right
[31:00] so what did
[31:01] what did he see
[31:03] what did john see
[31:05] he saw the lord jesus
[31:08] just watch the following part of it
[31:11] that door
[31:13] the lord jesus
[31:16] no i looked and behold the door was open
[31:19] in heaven in the first voice which i
[31:21] heard
[31:21] was a voice of a trumpet
[31:27] now the scene is changing john's being
[31:30] been watching patmos you know
[31:33] one two or three
[31:36] and now he looks up
[31:37] what
[31:39] he sees something went on on earth here
[31:43] these church ages
[31:45] all down to the seven church ages
[31:47] and then after he got through seeing the
[31:50] church ages
[31:51] after that after the church ages has
[31:54] ceased
[31:55] he heard a voice
[31:57] he looked up towards heaven and he seen
[32:00] an open door
[32:02] and the first voice sounded like a
[32:05] trumpet
[32:06] all right
[32:07] seen change from patmos to heaven
[32:14] now
[32:17] think about
[32:18] that door though for a little bit before
[32:20] we get into the voice
[32:23] and we'll cover in a few minutes
[32:25] because you go back to revelation 3 8
[32:29] in the church ages series
[32:31] and it covers the door
[32:34] and we know that jesus said i'm the door
[32:36] of the sheep folk right amen
[32:40] right so john saw jesus
[32:46] but he was in the symbol of a door
[32:50] an open door
[32:54] a way in right
[32:59] he was there and he was seeing those
[33:02] things
[33:05] you know
[33:08] then
[33:09] as i said he wasn't looking for the door
[33:14] he was wanting the understanding of
[33:18] who that door was
[33:21] because he knew it meant something right
[33:25] he already wrote if he'll be in the door
[33:28] in the church ages
[33:31] all right
[33:32] he already wrote the gospel of john
[33:38] that covers
[33:39] jesus as a door
[33:42] to the sheep folk
[33:46] all right
[33:48] so we're not looking at a door
[33:54] we're looking at the door
[33:56] amen
[33:58] the lord jesus himself
[34:04] showing himself
[34:07] see because we'll get to it in a minute
[34:09] it's got to be covered you know to the
[34:10] bases it'll come up with the bride of
[34:12] christ that's right
[34:13] all right
[34:15] but showing
[34:17] something had taken place
[34:25] the bride goes up in revelations 4 1.
[34:28] brother brown said john going there will
[34:30] read a minute is the type right of the
[34:32] rapture because when the church ages is
[34:35] over
[34:36] yeah see right then there comes a
[34:38] rapture all right
[34:41] but going up the bride
[34:43] okay
[34:46] now
[34:47] keep in mind then
[34:50] that we're talking about the lord jesus
[34:53] christ
[34:56] he's the door amen amen he's the only
[34:59] door there is to heaven
[35:04] right
[35:06] and the doors open
[35:12] now back in the old testament
[35:14] they might have thought about a door
[35:17] build a door tried to describe something
[35:18] by a door
[35:20] it was always closed
[35:25] see here the doors
[35:29] all open
[35:31] now quoting brother branham from
[35:37] the church i'm in the seal book
[35:42] he said they're selling seals
[35:45] but then he comes over and he says and
[35:47] the seals are open
[35:51] all right
[35:53] which means an opportunity to be
[35:56] revealed
[35:57] right
[35:59] now open door back in the church ages
[36:01] could represent like in the sixth church
[36:03] age would represent a missionary work
[36:07] that would be traveling about the world
[36:11] right the missionary right
[36:14] all right he actually said the open door
[36:15] was literally between the
[36:17] sixth church age and the seventh in the
[36:19] overlap and if you need that we have
[36:21] those quotes
[36:24] but you see it's a it's a revelation
[36:28] what is john seeing
[36:30] a revelation
[36:32] of jesus christ
[36:34] amen
[36:37] how did he now have that door and it's
[36:39] open
[36:41] then we're able to come in so pull it
[36:43] back up now we're going to the voice
[36:45] when i keep that in mind
[36:49] go back to paragraph 102.
[36:54] now we get to the voice
[36:56] and the voice was the same voice that
[36:58] walked into seven golden candlestick
[37:03] same voice
[37:05] the voice didn't change
[37:11] did we get down in a minute to where he
[37:12] says charlie the voice that called you
[37:14] and told you to turn around will one day
[37:16] call you until you come up amen
[37:21] me now you remember when we was in
[37:23] revelations 1
[37:26] john turned to see the voice
[37:32] right
[37:34] he knew the voice
[37:36] and he was very familiar with the voice
[37:42] so then would it be any problem like the
[37:44] prophet said he he saw the lord jesus
[37:48] well because that was who he's expecting
[37:50] to see
[37:55] but he saw him as a descriptive
[37:57] form of
[37:59] an open door
[38:03] right right
[38:04] then a voice sounds out
[38:07] from inside the door
[38:09] right
[38:11] and what does it do
[38:14] see same voice
[38:16] the voice didn't change
[38:18] but the voice where was it
[38:20] when he heard it the first time
[38:22] listen where was it when he heard first
[38:24] down on earth
[38:25] i mean it remembers in the first church
[38:27] age behind him
[38:29] i was in the spirit of the lord's day
[38:30] that's revelation 1
[38:32] 10 there
[38:33] we just got through it through to verse
[38:35] 13. if you wanted to put it down i was
[38:38] in the spirit on the lord's day i heard
[38:39] behind the voices of a trumpet that
[38:41] sounded like many waters
[38:44] and my turn the looks in many waters
[38:46] with many preachers preaching down
[38:47] through the ages
[38:49] and i saw one standing in the midst of
[38:50] seven golden candlestick
[38:52] now after he showed him all that mystery
[38:55] of them seven golden candlesticks
[38:57] holding the stars and the white wig on
[38:59] and so forth and feet like bryce and
[39:01] eyes like fire the symbols
[39:04] then he heard the same voice
[39:06] once
[39:08] speaking from heaven
[39:11] and he looked up and he saw an open door
[39:14] oh an open door into heaven
[39:16] how do you get in
[39:18] by jesus christ that one door one way
[39:22] no other way
[39:25] so now what did john see
[39:30] an open door
[39:33] and a voice
[39:35] the voice that he'd heard on earth when
[39:36] he was walking with him
[39:38] and the voice that he heard in
[39:40] revelations one thing
[39:43] because the voice never changes
[39:45] that's right
[39:47] it's hard for me to call some most all
[39:49] of you and say
[39:50] hi how you doing you automatically so
[39:53] brother dale how are you
[39:54] why because you know my voice
[39:56] right
[39:57] you see john knew that voice
[40:00] that's right all right so it's no
[40:03] surprise when he hears the voice
[40:07] but the surprise always comes is like
[40:09] chapter one when he turned to see the
[40:11] voice he saw seven golden kettles did
[40:15] now he turns
[40:17] to see the voice
[40:19] it's an open door
[40:22] away to heaven
[40:25] we can't have a rapture unless you get
[40:26] away right you know
[40:29] all right
[40:30] so now that's what we're going to be
[40:31] dealing with it's called an open door
[40:37] see no other way amen
[40:39] all right go to number three
[40:44] all right
[40:46] revelations
[40:48] chapter 4 part 3
[40:50] 61 108 paragraph 71
[40:54] and we find out after these things he
[40:56] heard a voice that was speaking to him
[40:58] that oh what was it the spirit left the
[41:01] earth
[41:02] all right
[41:03] after these things start out at the
[41:05] first chapter
[41:07] or the first verse
[41:09] after i looked and behold the door was
[41:10] opened in heaven revelation 4 1.
[41:14] after the church was gone
[41:16] then the door was open now don't get
[41:18] confused right now right
[41:22] it will take place to israel
[41:25] sure
[41:27] so don't get confused and hung on that
[41:29] part that he's saying
[41:31] this revelation that we receive to go
[41:34] into rapture
[41:35] we'll turn to israel when we go into
[41:37] rapture you agree
[41:40] amen so it will be there and we just
[41:42] keep it down here where we're at right
[41:44] all right
[41:45] so revelation 4 1 after the church was
[41:48] gone then the door was open and we went
[41:50] through that
[41:51] through all of that and found that that
[41:53] was christ was the door and the same
[41:56] voice that was walking in the midst of
[41:57] the seven golden candlestick also was
[42:00] the same voice he heard in heaven saying
[42:02] come up hither
[42:04] john went up it represented the church
[42:06] going in the rapture
[42:08] john went up in the spirit was taken
[42:10] away into heaven and for so i foresaw
[42:13] all the things that god promised
[42:15] and said to his disciples
[42:18] what is it to you if he cares till i
[42:20] come he saw the coming of the lord and
[42:22] what would take place
[42:24] he saw on earth what would take place on
[42:27] earth
[42:28] to the rapture of the church
[42:30] and was taken up to show plum on down
[42:32] even to a past the millennium oh isn't
[42:36] that wonderful
[42:37] now
[42:38] the voice
[42:42] and the door
[42:44] would have to be the same person
[42:47] right you agree
[42:50] the voice and the door is the same
[42:52] person right
[42:53] the only thing is signifying is is one
[42:56] is signifying the person
[42:59] the door
[43:01] to heaven the other is signifying his
[43:03] voice
[43:05] all right
[43:07] now the voice is the same it don't
[43:08] change
[43:10] all
[43:10] right so now watson come on down to the
[43:13] next one
[43:17] paragraph 125 related chapter 4 part 1
[43:20] 1960 1231.
[43:22] oh and john oh i know john being taken
[43:26] up immediately after the church age was
[43:29] the type of the raptured church
[43:31] immediately after the church age is over
[43:33] this lady of sin age then comes the
[43:35] rapture the church goes up like john did
[43:38] into the presence of god oh my
[43:40] that just winds my soul around caught up
[43:43] at
[43:44] caught up at the rapture of the church
[43:46] and it said this place
[43:48] the book of revelation was written see
[43:50] at the end of the church age all right
[43:52] now as i said don't get tied up with
[43:56] thinking
[43:57] in your mind when he'll say
[43:59] the bride goes up in revelations 4 1.
[44:05] because just remember that you and i are
[44:07] not up yet
[44:08] right okay
[44:12] but the book is unfolded
[44:15] right
[44:17] see we're not changed yet
[44:20] so when we're changing we'll go to
[44:21] israel this message will go straight to
[44:23] israel
[44:24] all right when we're changed all right
[44:27] and they'll tell them about us
[44:29] that made the change right but we're
[44:32] back here now
[44:35] and the rapture is out in front of us
[44:37] hopingly in the morning all right
[44:40] hopefully before the service is over but
[44:42] irregardless is still ahead of us right
[44:46] so
[44:48] here we are over here though
[44:52] and he told abraham
[44:55] he said
[44:56] can i withhold anything
[44:59] from abraham
[45:03] now what about a god that would thank so
[45:05] much of abraham that he showed the whole
[45:07] entire future that's right
[45:10] right sure
[45:11] amen
[45:16] what do you think about him with us
[45:20] is it not very easy for him to show us
[45:23] what will be
[45:25] if he's already as we covered in
[45:27] revelations 1 now
[45:30] he's already looked through and seen it
[45:32] and told us
[45:34] before he ever even started writing
[45:36] about it
[45:38] now we're talking about that we're here
[45:40] as mortal beings
[45:44] and god by that same voice
[45:50] is now describing the things
[45:54] that will be highest
[45:56] you know back under has been
[45:59] he is now
[46:03] and the future because that's what the
[46:04] seal is revealed that's right highest
[46:06] present in the future all right
[46:08] now
[46:09] so we get the entire revelation while
[46:11] we're still here amen seeing this that
[46:13] revelation now watch
[46:17] that revelation that you and i receive
[46:19] while we're here
[46:21] is what forms that open door amen
[46:24] that's right
[46:29] i don't know whether it'd be the correct
[46:30] way of saying it but that's the best way
[46:31] i know how to say it
[46:34] we're going to stand here on earth
[46:38] and hear a voice out of heaven
[46:42] we're not going to look up trying to try
[46:43] to find an open door
[46:47] right to see how big it is and just in
[46:49] case because some of us might be 400
[46:52] pounds you know
[46:53] and we want to make sure it's a good 42
[46:55] inch door or something i don't think i
[46:57] can make one that big but
[46:59] i know 36 is pretty big
[47:02] just making that is a point for you to
[47:04] think
[47:06] we're going to stand right here
[47:09] and see ourselves dire right
[47:11] or we're not going there
[47:13] now i'm talking about the ones that are
[47:14] changing among the twinkling of an eye
[47:16] that's correct
[47:18] right
[47:20] somebody's going to stand right here
[47:22] and see what john saw
[47:28] but you know what you're going to see
[47:29] when you look up there
[47:31] john looked up there and saw jesus
[47:36] come on
[47:38] when it unfolds correctly to you and i
[47:41] we will look up there and see jesus
[47:43] that's right
[47:44] all right
[47:46] but we'll see the form he's in
[47:51] he's in the ground right amen that's
[47:52] right
[47:53] right that's right see i i didn't finish
[47:56] up what i thought about the other day
[47:57] right for
[47:58] i just laid it down enough for us to get
[48:00] the point
[48:04] see what are we looking for
[48:07] well i don't see an open door up there
[48:09] you know
[48:10] okay
[48:12] i mean you think you got to have a key
[48:14] you think it's some kind of a locked
[48:16] door or
[48:17] whatever you know
[48:19] it's a revelation amen
[48:22] what john saw
[48:25] of god
[48:27] while he was on earth i'm talking about
[48:29] the lord jesus christ
[48:32] on the day of pentecost
[48:35] that began to be quickened
[48:37] unto him
[48:39] right right
[48:41] right
[48:41] and show you even things to come the
[48:44] scripture says
[48:45] so
[48:47] john was shown all the way
[48:50] even past the millennium see over the
[48:51] end of the future home
[48:55] all right and from right here now if the
[48:57] rapture took place today that would have
[48:59] to be three and a half plus a thousand
[49:01] so
[49:02] you know a thousand three and a half
[49:04] years so
[49:06] he saw a whole lot
[49:09] all right that's what i just think about
[49:11] it
[49:13] what was john looking at
[49:18] all right
[49:18] go to the next one
[49:24] all right
[49:26] revelations most of these are out of
[49:27] revelation chapter four just two or
[49:29] three parts of 61 0 101 paragraph 39
[49:35] and we find that after these things
[49:38] after a minute that after the church
[49:40] ages can
[49:43] all cease then john was summons to come
[49:46] up higher
[49:47] come up higher which means come up here
[49:50] he showed him all that was going to
[49:52] happen in the world of the church age
[49:55] then after the church ages was over
[49:58] we find then that john was
[50:00] a type
[50:02] of every true believer that will be
[50:04] summoned
[50:05] by christ on high
[50:07] and what
[50:08] that's that right solomon's come up
[50:11] hither and we find out that the voice
[50:13] that spoke to him was the voice of a
[50:16] trumpet cleared distinctly and it was
[50:18] the same voice that spoke to him here on
[50:20] earth
[50:22] see
[50:24] as long as he was in the midst of the
[50:26] seven golden candlesticks he was
[50:28] speaking to or from listen
[50:32] and watch what he was doing
[50:34] as long as he was in the midst of the
[50:36] seven golden candlestick he was speaking
[50:38] to are from while i know we're speaking
[50:41] from the candlestick right
[50:43] the
[50:44] he was in the candlestick speaking from
[50:46] them
[50:47] to his church
[50:49] then when the church age had ceased
[50:52] he left the earth and moved up into
[50:54] heaven
[50:55] heavens and he called his redeemed up
[50:58] with him oh isn't that beautiful
[51:00] but it just makes your heart jump
[51:03] now
[51:04] he
[51:06] saw and heard the voice
[51:10] john was a type of ever true believer
[51:15] now
[51:18] i want you to think with me a little bit
[51:19] because this will help later
[51:24] now remember
[51:28] was john taken up
[51:33] literally in flesh
[51:37] to see these things
[51:41] in other words did he literally go up
[51:44] did he literally say did he really
[51:45] follow through
[51:50] i don't think so
[51:54] right around and when he went beyond the
[51:55] curtain of time his body was still
[51:57] laying on the bed
[51:58] that's right i don't think his body went
[52:00] there right and i don't think his soul
[52:02] went out of his body
[52:05] you know what i mean spirit or something
[52:06] went out of his body because that would
[52:08] that would mean he'd be deep it's just
[52:10] fine since but
[52:12] need no understanding
[52:14] he's indeed
[52:16] so as john
[52:19] did he literally go over and see this or
[52:21] did he raise up out of himself into a
[52:26] spiritual realm
[52:29] and the prophet of god said he was
[52:30] actually over the earth
[52:32] well john said he was in the spirit on
[52:34] the lord's day
[52:37] you know
[52:38] so he couldn't argue with him if he said
[52:40] john was you there he said i die
[52:44] so but john according to the records we
[52:46] have you were shackled to a tree on
[52:49] patmos and guards were standing around
[52:52] you
[52:54] i don't care what you think i was there
[52:58] he brought brown's body was laying on
[53:00] the bed
[53:02] not a dead body
[53:07] but he's in the spirit amen
[53:12] but now if you're listening you
[53:13] understand what i'm trying to get to
[53:17] so then john was the type of the rapture
[53:21] that will one day come
[53:29] come on
[53:31] yep
[53:31] john was a type of the rapture
[53:34] that will one day come into reality
[53:38] into you and i right
[53:42] now
[53:43] so he wasn't raptured up into the
[53:45] heavens bodily and everything you know
[53:48] no
[53:52] so now listen
[53:55] if brother branham could stay here in
[53:57] body
[53:59] and go there
[54:01] in a spiritual realm theophany whatever
[54:03] you want to call it
[54:07] and see all of these things
[54:11] and john could
[54:14] literally be on the isle of patmos
[54:17] maybe lay back under a tree you know
[54:19] like i said maybe shackled to a tree and
[54:22] a guard stand inside of him you know
[54:30] but yet he was there
[54:34] that's how real it was
[54:38] so now here's where the prophet comes in
[54:43] he said jesus is going to become visible
[54:45] among us
[54:48] not corporal now you'd say that because
[54:50] corporal body we we meet it in the air
[54:52] going towards it
[54:54] in the rapture right
[54:56] the corporal body don't come back to the
[54:58] millennium
[54:59] but the lord jesus can be so visible
[55:01] among us that he can raise the dead when
[55:03] going rapture that's right
[55:08] now remember how many years ago there
[55:10] was a message or a series i preached
[55:12] called matching pieces
[55:14] five ten years ago
[55:17] fifteen maybe
[55:19] nineteen 1995 wait can tell you because
[55:21] that was when he come back to the lord
[55:23] so
[55:24] all right
[55:25] that's been quite a few years
[55:27] and what i was talking about then was
[55:30] exactly what i'm talking about now
[55:31] that's right
[55:32] amen when we can stand here
[55:36] and see ourselves there
[55:42] ain't gonna be no problem to go that's
[55:43] right
[55:46] all right but you see that's what i've
[55:49] always tried to describe now
[55:51] you remember the point i've always made
[55:54] if i can't see it in my new birth
[55:57] i can't farm it
[56:00] all right no matter how good it sounds
[56:02] it just doesn't match up it's not in my
[56:03] new birth right
[56:04] because you see in my new birth i went
[56:06] into reap to a realm of reality that's
[56:08] right of eternity
[56:11] by the baptism of the holy ghost
[56:13] amen my soul yep my body and spirit is
[56:17] still here
[56:18] like brother branham's was laying on the
[56:20] base right like john was laying on
[56:22] patterns
[56:25] but the soul is eternal by the new birth
[56:31] now brother dean can remember when
[56:34] one day he was telling me how he had
[56:36] high blood pressure
[56:39] and most of you wouldn't know you know
[56:41] it was called a gondola which is a big
[56:43] old trash can
[56:44] all right
[56:45] general motors had these big trash cans
[56:47] up a little bit around with a big trash
[56:49] can to carry off the stuff that was
[56:50] called a gondola if i mispronounced that
[56:52] you just keep it right
[56:54] but it was a trash can
[56:57] i was standing there running a job that
[56:59] it took two people to run when i was
[57:01] ever out
[57:02] but yet i was still capable of talking
[57:04] to him
[57:06] and he said something about his blood
[57:08] pressure was running up
[57:09] i said well brother dean this is what
[57:11] you got to do
[57:13] i said can you stand here
[57:15] and that was probably what maybe 40 50
[57:18] feet or maybe further down the line i
[57:19] don't know
[57:21] maybe a hundred feet away from where we
[57:23] were i said but you've got to believe
[57:25] that you're standing down there and not
[57:27] standing here
[57:32] he stood there a second he said i see
[57:34] what you're talking about
[57:36] okay
[57:39] so he takes off and he leaves he said i
[57:41] gotta go
[57:42] so he goes already thinking to go back
[57:44] to his work station and
[57:46] he decides to go have his blood pressure
[57:48] checked
[57:50] so he cuts up goes over the top comes
[57:52] back down to the thing and
[57:55] i'm working and
[57:56] you know
[57:57] done forgot about what we were
[58:00] we were talking about
[58:02] because i was really busy running the
[58:04] job
[58:05] but all at once i've become and most of
[58:07] you know i'm i've always been in my life
[58:09] a very strong person
[58:11] i've never
[58:12] never known
[58:14] when the man said that he'd never known
[58:15] weakness he was talking about spiritual
[58:16] weakness
[58:17] but until i was up from 70 years old i
[58:20] never knew witness
[58:22] and i still don't know as much as a lot
[58:24] of people at 50. that's right
[58:26] all right
[58:27] but all at once my knees i mean my legs
[58:29] were just me i was i was just having
[58:31] trouble i couldn't couldn't hardly even
[58:33] walk let alone run my job and i just and
[58:36] you know just so nervous and my legs are
[58:38] just weakened out i was just so weak and
[58:40] wrung out it was worse than if i
[58:42] worked all day or tried to run for a
[58:44] mile or whatever we used to do because
[58:46] until i was you know 30 years old we
[58:49] played basketball every night
[58:51] and stuff like that you know
[58:53] a 20-something year old in there and uh
[58:56] you know
[58:57] but i look down the line and i see him
[58:59] coming
[59:00] he was just barely touching the ground
[59:02] getting down there but
[59:04] he comes down and he said my blood
[59:06] pressure is perfect
[59:09] that's not i don't know what it is
[59:12] now with that illustration in mind
[59:16] can you see what i'm talking about
[59:18] john is here on patmos
[59:22] he had to be body spirit of soul there
[59:25] as a human being or he'd be dead
[59:28] brother branham was
[59:29] on debate laying there that's right
[59:33] are you actually coming back and seeing
[59:34] yourself moving that's right
[59:37] see but something happened in the
[59:39] spiritual realm
[59:42] of reality
[59:43] that he went beyond the curtain of time
[59:47] and saw the people there
[59:50] no
[59:52] john went beyond the curtain of time and
[59:54] he saw the future
[59:57] and what would happen to the church you
[1:00:00] know the pride
[1:00:05] can you understand that right amen
[1:00:09] he could be here and yet still be there
[1:00:13] because that's a revelation there is no
[1:00:14] there is no geographical um
[1:00:18] position um let me say i hope there's no
[1:00:21] condition existing or or
[1:00:24] you know a revelation is beyond all
[1:00:27] realities
[1:00:31] it what is the word supersedes which
[1:00:32] means goes well beyond any reality
[1:00:36] of anything
[1:00:38] natural
[1:00:39] the greatest you can think of natural
[1:00:43] it doesn't even start to think of the
[1:00:44] supernatural
[1:00:48] so now you can see what it's doing
[1:00:51] but now i'm asking the question because
[1:00:53] we're trying to drive us back down to
[1:00:54] revelation 4 1. had john
[1:00:59] not had the three and a half years or
[1:01:01] the tutoring of the word that's right
[1:01:06] and the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:01:10] that was given to him in the upper you
[1:01:12] know the
[1:01:14] upper room
[1:01:16] and placing him at the
[1:01:19] faith of the fathers
[1:01:21] right here where it says holy spirit
[1:01:23] right
[1:01:26] if he hadn't had that
[1:01:29] he would not have been capable
[1:01:33] of comprehending what was taking place
[1:01:40] now
[1:01:41] i believe every person damn you i've
[1:01:43] explained the split condition of the day
[1:01:45] of pentecost
[1:01:47] 120 nil per room
[1:01:49] heard the word for three and a half
[1:01:51] years
[1:01:52] was placed at brotherly kindness or in
[1:01:55] the words of the holy spirit on the
[1:01:56] pyramid
[1:01:58] but didn't have the headstone because it
[1:01:59] hadn't come yet
[1:02:01] that's your prophet
[1:02:02] but everybody born after them was born
[1:02:04] as a baby down in faith
[1:02:06] and he regardless if brother branham was
[1:02:08] a prophet
[1:02:10] he was born again at faith right
[1:02:13] he wasn't born again at the headstone
[1:02:15] right
[1:02:20] so then he had to be taught
[1:02:23] but had he not there in the ending of 62
[1:02:28] coming into the 63 toward the opening of
[1:02:30] the seals
[1:02:32] had he not had the revelation of jesus
[1:02:34] christ
[1:02:37] that the apostles had right
[1:02:39] are you with me amen
[1:02:44] understanding the godhead and clarity
[1:02:46] perfect
[1:02:47] as the apostles had
[1:02:50] seen the seals couldn't open to the
[1:02:51] prophet
[1:02:53] and watch
[1:02:55] he may have went there in his early life
[1:02:57] of 58 or something maybe when he was
[1:02:58] transferred
[1:03:00] that don't have to do with it
[1:03:04] it was his revelation of jesus christ
[1:03:06] that took him beyond the curtain of time
[1:03:08] that's right that's right
[1:03:10] it is yours and my revelation of jesus
[1:03:14] christ
[1:03:15] that is going to take us out of this
[1:03:18] world
[1:03:20] that's why that i've been accused of
[1:03:22] just preaching and doing this or that or
[1:03:24] the other just just an old
[1:03:27] you know teacher and no spirituality
[1:03:29] about me or nothing
[1:03:31] but i'm still trying to pound the same
[1:03:34] thing
[1:03:35] right
[1:03:36] it's not my responsibility for it to be
[1:03:38] spiritual that's god's responsibility
[1:03:41] it's my responsibility to preach it
[1:03:44] to try to bring it to the people where
[1:03:46] god can reveal it
[1:03:47] but you see it's not going to do you any
[1:03:49] good to see john over there
[1:03:56] that's where the good numbers are i
[1:03:57] ain't saying with no good not you know
[1:03:59] but you understand what i mean ain't
[1:04:01] gonna change you to see john standing
[1:04:02] there
[1:04:04] ain't gonna change you to see brother
[1:04:05] around beyond the curtain of time and
[1:04:06] they're gonna take you beyond the
[1:04:07] curtain time right just because you say
[1:04:09] you see him there
[1:04:12] it's when you have the same experience
[1:04:15] to be able to go there
[1:04:18] and somebody's going to stand here
[1:04:20] and look down the under at the end of
[1:04:22] something
[1:04:24] and say i'm already over there that's
[1:04:26] right
[1:04:29] why can't we believe that amen
[1:04:31] i ain't gonna charge you for that
[1:04:32] because that was not in the message
[1:04:36] but i hope it will give you
[1:04:37] understanding of what we're talking
[1:04:38] about amen
[1:04:40] all right go ahead to the next one
[1:04:41] brother
[1:04:42] let's stay on this voice do we see it
[1:04:46] should be number six
[1:04:48] revelation chapter four part paragraph
[1:04:50] 149 150 going on through i think on to
[1:04:53] another paragraph
[1:04:56] there was a voice that called him all
[1:04:58] that voice oh i can't get away from that
[1:05:01] the voice of that one behind him
[1:05:04] then he looked around see it's almost an
[1:05:05] identical quote as the other one
[1:05:08] and he showed him all of the church ages
[1:05:10] because he was standing in the church
[1:05:12] ages the seven golden candlestick then
[1:05:14] he heard that voice after the church
[1:05:16] ages ceased that voice left the earth
[1:05:19] went up
[1:05:20] when he got into glory he heard him say
[1:05:22] come up here i'm going to show you
[1:05:24] what's going to happen from here after
[1:05:26] oh my
[1:05:28] now
[1:05:34] if john is taken up
[1:05:38] through the open door to show him
[1:05:43] all the future
[1:05:46] what would be the problem of us being
[1:05:48] able to stand here
[1:05:50] and from his
[1:05:52] description
[1:05:56] and the prophet's interpretation
[1:06:00] what would be the trouble of us standing
[1:06:02] here
[1:06:07] and seeing it
[1:06:08] eternal already
[1:06:12] so that way you're not waiting on
[1:06:13] something if you've got a revelation
[1:06:15] something you're not waiting on it may
[1:06:16] be 50 years later before it comes but
[1:06:18] you're not waiting on it because it's
[1:06:19] real to you
[1:06:20] right
[1:06:22] something's revealed to you it doesn't
[1:06:23] make no difference what's the time
[1:06:24] element
[1:06:25] that's irregardless
[1:06:28] all right so think on that that's hard
[1:06:30] for me to pull away from what i'm saying
[1:06:31] one go okay
[1:06:33] i'll try
[1:06:34] that voice let's speak on that voice a
[1:06:36] minute
[1:06:38] i got some scripture wrote down here
[1:06:41] now remember this is 1961.
[1:06:44] and brother branham didn't wait until
[1:06:46] 1965 or somewhere in there to where he
[1:06:49] began to preach about the the voice and
[1:06:52] the trumpet and the things he was
[1:06:54] already preaching it down through there
[1:06:56] and the rapture message he just summed
[1:06:58] it up into one thing and brought it
[1:07:00] right down to the point all right
[1:07:03] see let's pick oh i got some scriptures
[1:07:05] wrote down here let's go first and
[1:07:06] thessalonians forward just listen over
[1:07:08] here what this voice is going to say
[1:07:12] oh now what this voice is going to say
[1:07:14] now
[1:07:15] get the point
[1:07:17] he's on the voice that's calling up
[1:07:19] so let's see what this voice is going to
[1:07:21] say at thessalonians
[1:07:24] and what's being said in thessalonians
[1:07:26] got to be the same voice of what's being
[1:07:28] said above right
[1:07:30] follow me stay with me see
[1:07:33] oh we all know what it's going to say
[1:07:38] we all know what that voice is going to
[1:07:39] say
[1:07:54] don't we we know what's going to happen
[1:07:56] the trumpet of god shall sound and the
[1:07:58] dead in christ shall rise
[1:08:00] is that right you who are putting it
[1:08:03] down
[1:08:04] in first thessalonians 4 16 17 the voice
[1:08:07] that voice was the voice of christ is
[1:08:09] that right the voice of christ
[1:08:13] all right coming over into the
[1:08:14] paragraphs what are you using the
[1:08:16] scripture the same voice that summoned
[1:08:18] john come up
[1:08:21] these using thessalonians
[1:08:23] he's using revelation
[1:08:26] the same voice are you listening
[1:08:28] it's not a different voice we've done
[1:08:30] read that he said it's a safe voice
[1:08:32] same voice that called you and told you
[1:08:34] to turn around from sin it's the same
[1:08:36] voice that's causing you through the
[1:08:37] church i mean through the statue of a
[1:08:39] perfect man to come up higher come up
[1:08:41] higher come up higher come up higher and
[1:08:43] the love of god when it unites with the
[1:08:45] bride of christ
[1:08:46] it'll be the same voice and the same
[1:08:48] voice that we hear we'll call it sound
[1:08:50] of the world
[1:08:59] the same voice that said to john come up
[1:09:01] is the same voice that summons the
[1:09:02] church someday amen trump is a jerk
[1:09:06] also the same voice that psalm and john
[1:09:08] to come up is the same voice that
[1:09:10] summons
[1:09:11] dead
[1:09:12] lazarus out of the grave
[1:09:15] i hope i pronounced it summons but i
[1:09:17] kept looking at that one i gotta get
[1:09:18] right out and say that don't even look
[1:09:21] good
[1:09:22] and that same voice of the archangel
[1:09:24] christ is the voice of the archangel
[1:09:25] voice of the archangel
[1:09:27] see all that trumpet voice of christ
[1:09:29] some and john to come up the same voice
[1:09:32] summon lazarus they remember in the
[1:09:34] message
[1:09:35] the rapture
[1:09:36] the same voice that raised lazarus is
[1:09:38] the same voice i'm going to call you
[1:09:41] did you notice it at the grave of
[1:09:43] lazarus he spoke with a loud voice not
[1:09:46] just said lazarus come forth lazarus
[1:09:48] come forth
[1:09:50] it summons him from the dead
[1:09:53] and he answered here am i
[1:09:55] and he come forth from the dead after he
[1:09:58] was dead and his body rotten than once
[1:10:02] the same voice said to john come up here
[1:10:05] i'll show you some things that's fixing
[1:10:07] to happen
[1:10:10] that same voice that shall sound when
[1:10:12] the dead in christ shall rise for the
[1:10:15] trumpet the trumpet what is the trump
[1:10:17] it's the voice of christ
[1:10:19] okay
[1:10:20] the same one sounded and summoned him up
[1:10:23] he heard the voice like a trumpet sound
[1:10:25] and said come up hither see how the
[1:10:27] resurrection will be it will be in a
[1:10:29] moment in a twinkling of an eye that
[1:10:30] clear sounding voice and he'll summons
[1:10:32] the church calling come out of it that
[1:10:35] great summoning voice
[1:10:36] god helped me to hear it in it that day
[1:10:40] amen right
[1:10:42] that's right i think i've got two more
[1:10:44] so
[1:10:44] let's go ahead
[1:10:46] maybe
[1:10:46] three more let's go to the next one
[1:10:51] revelation chapter 4 part 2 61 101
[1:10:55] i got 66.
[1:10:57] that's the same thing that takes place
[1:10:59] right here the church was taken up into
[1:11:01] heaven
[1:11:02] and john now is brought up with it as a
[1:11:05] type of the resurrected
[1:11:07] i mean he even brings resurrection upon
[1:11:09] it
[1:11:10] as we look as we took it last night and
[1:11:13] we find out that this same voice that
[1:11:15] summoned him to come to look
[1:11:17] him to look back on earth was the same
[1:11:20] voice that summons him to come up
[1:11:22] whoever christian every voice charlie
[1:11:26] that summons you
[1:11:27] the very voice charlie that summons you
[1:11:30] one day down there in kentucky to turn
[1:11:32] around is the same voice that'll summons
[1:11:35] you hello aren't you glad
[1:11:37] of that brother evans
[1:11:39] the voice that said turn around the same
[1:11:41] voice said come up oh my there what a
[1:11:44] summons what a reality clear distinct
[1:11:47] like a trumpet turn around serve me come
[1:11:49] up to where i am
[1:11:52] same voice
[1:11:54] same voice
[1:11:59] why would anybody be looking for another
[1:12:01] voice
[1:12:06] but yet to run to and fro in the land
[1:12:07] talk about the people of the message
[1:12:09] trying to find some
[1:12:10] body with some new thing or some new
[1:12:12] thought or some idea
[1:12:15] to try to change us
[1:12:20] i thought the resurrection was already
[1:12:21] inside of you man
[1:12:24] you see that i thought the change would
[1:12:26] be from the inside out
[1:12:28] that's right
[1:12:31] right question answer 64 they asked the
[1:12:33] prophet what will be the translation of
[1:12:35] the bride you suggest to change
[1:12:38] your glorified bodies built around your
[1:12:40] born-again experience
[1:12:43] so when you're born again at faith then
[1:12:46] you start growing in grace and knowledge
[1:12:48] faith virtual knowledge temperature
[1:12:50] godliness
[1:12:51] and one day it will turn out to be what
[1:12:55] the statue of a perfect man
[1:12:58] right
[1:13:01] inside of you and i am
[1:13:05] now if it was right that john could not
[1:13:09] write the book of revelation just
[1:13:10] remember now i quote it this way
[1:13:13] remember that no novice was a writer of
[1:13:16] the bible right there's that when i say
[1:13:18] that word right novice which means a
[1:13:20] child you know a young person uh
[1:13:23] no young person like that that baby in
[1:13:25] the gospel was allowed to write the word
[1:13:29] it took those who were seasoned in the
[1:13:31] gospel to be able to write the word
[1:13:33] all right then it would take those
[1:13:35] seasoned in the gospel to be able to
[1:13:37] comprehend what it would be what was
[1:13:39] being said
[1:13:40] so if john could not have
[1:13:43] been able to go to patmos unless it was
[1:13:46] linked to his revelation
[1:13:49] see he had to know who that door was
[1:13:52] that's why when he looked up he didn't
[1:13:54] get all shook up and just standing there
[1:13:56] looking at the door and he said oh door
[1:13:58] don't knock no no what's the goal for
[1:14:00] now what we need
[1:14:02] we need jacob's letter
[1:14:05] yeah
[1:14:05] yeah
[1:14:06] because we got to climb up to there
[1:14:09] well that might have been a good problem
[1:14:13] but see he didn't see it that way
[1:14:17] when he saw the door he knew exactly who
[1:14:19] that was
[1:14:21] it was the lord jesus christ
[1:14:24] and he heard his voice
[1:14:32] and remember it's the voice also of many
[1:14:35] waters
[1:14:37] many people
[1:14:39] same voice
[1:14:41] the voices in the bright room is in the
[1:14:43] bride am i right
[1:14:46] you remember what we read earlier today
[1:14:48] phoenix enough the bride under her
[1:14:50] messenger will be the final voice
[1:14:53] to the final at eve that's right
[1:14:55] so if you get anything now from god
[1:14:57] you're going to have to come through the
[1:14:58] bride right amen i believe that
[1:15:02] there was a time maybe that god could
[1:15:03] bypass and do things but i believe it's
[1:15:05] closing the door pretty fast don't you
[1:15:07] we ain't got nothing to do with opening
[1:15:08] we kind of deal with closing it but it's
[1:15:10] one of these days it will be closed
[1:15:13] it won't be our fault it closed or
[1:15:15] or didn't close
[1:15:17] he's the one that's going to do it right
[1:15:20] but listen church
[1:15:22] that ain't got a thing to do with us
[1:15:24] what somebody else does right amen what
[1:15:26] a lot of these churches in the mexicans
[1:15:27] doing and the way they're running
[1:15:29] nothing to do with you and i that's true
[1:15:31] none whatsoever i'm not preaching out
[1:15:32] there anybody on the internet i'm not
[1:15:34] your pastor
[1:15:35] this is just out there if you want to
[1:15:36] listen
[1:15:40] but if you claim this your pastor and
[1:15:42] son does
[1:15:45] well
[1:15:46] all right
[1:15:48] then listen to what i'm saying
[1:15:53] john saw
[1:15:54] jesus
[1:15:58] now brother brown said when you begin to
[1:16:01] see the word
[1:16:04] you need this one he said you'll be
[1:16:06] seeing jesus
[1:16:10] sure
[1:16:12] when the word begins to be unfolded to
[1:16:14] you and i not just looking at it on page
[1:16:17] but when it begins to be revealed and
[1:16:19] made known in our hearts
[1:16:21] and lives
[1:16:22] i thought we believed the rapture was
[1:16:24] already in process
[1:16:26] right
[1:16:27] that's right inside of us
[1:16:31] and you know then the lord will show us
[1:16:33] something
[1:16:35] you know what he actually does when he
[1:16:37] shows you something
[1:16:39] sister gayle when he was
[1:16:41] there in the kitchen and he showed you
[1:16:42] one god
[1:16:45] do you know that that goes from here to
[1:16:47] beyond
[1:16:49] the mortals realms of life
[1:16:53] out into an eternal
[1:16:55] what would you call it habitation or
[1:16:57] position or placing
[1:17:00] a reality of eternity
[1:17:03] has struck us just for a second
[1:17:05] and that's all it is
[1:17:07] i remember one time when i've told you
[1:17:08] about it i'm not making light of the man
[1:17:10] but he was telling how he went fishing
[1:17:12] city he's going through over here he
[1:17:14] kept fishing over here and said the lord
[1:17:15] should fish over there and he's the
[1:17:16] normal fish over here and he's going to
[1:17:18] fish over there he's almost fishing over
[1:17:19] here so it alone our argument you know
[1:17:22] between him and the lord were to fish
[1:17:24] but he didn't finally didn't catch that
[1:17:25] finally throwing the hole caught a bunch
[1:17:26] of fish or a bigger you know
[1:17:28] but the lord they never dealt with me
[1:17:31] that way
[1:17:32] it's always a split second
[1:17:35] and it's probably less than a split
[1:17:36] second right you know
[1:17:38] i i like that for the twinkling of an
[1:17:40] eye yeah you know i ain't never figured
[1:17:42] that out yet and everybody trying to
[1:17:43] explain what it is and the bat and the
[1:17:45] twinkling of this
[1:17:46] or something but
[1:17:49] a revelation takes you into eternity
[1:17:55] and just for whatever time that is
[1:17:57] that's right
[1:18:01] i've come here and you've seen me do it
[1:18:04] tell you the lord spoke to me about
[1:18:05] something preached three four five
[1:18:07] months before it ever got to the point
[1:18:11] that he really told me
[1:18:14] you know why
[1:18:16] because it's all in the word
[1:18:23] see an open door
[1:18:25] is a revelation of the supreme deity go
[1:18:27] ahead and roll those up brother and
[1:18:28] we'll just read them off and then we'll
[1:18:30] get through it
[1:18:32] see what an open door really is this is
[1:18:34] from the philadelphian church age 1960
[1:18:37] 1210 an open door what is it it was a
[1:18:39] revelation of the supreme deity of jesus
[1:18:41] christ
[1:18:42] not being a second person of the trinity
[1:18:45] but being god himself made flesh and
[1:18:46] dwelling among us and the revelation all
[1:18:49] right
[1:18:50] now the first time that name's been
[1:18:51] spoke here and spoke lost his name
[1:18:53] lutheran them coming down through it and
[1:18:55] when we get to in between that there was
[1:18:57] an open door between the sixth and
[1:18:58] seventh days two ages there was an open
[1:19:01] door the open door was a revelation of
[1:19:03] the deity of jesus christ the oneness
[1:19:04] doctrine began to start back in the zeus
[1:19:08] street people
[1:19:11] right the truth began to come forth an
[1:19:13] open door which was a revelation of the
[1:19:15] deity to go to the next one
[1:19:17] huh
[1:19:18] and what does it i know that works this
[1:19:20] is philadelphia in church age 60 12 10.
[1:19:23] i know that works behold i set before
[1:19:25] then open door what is the open door the
[1:19:27] revelation of the supreme deity of jesus
[1:19:29] christ what did he say to his first
[1:19:31] church age first church back here
[1:19:34] back in this sage he said i am he that
[1:19:36] was which is and shall come i am the
[1:19:38] first of the lies i'm the almighty he
[1:19:41] said it three different
[1:19:42] at times made himself deity to his first
[1:19:45] church here before he went into the life
[1:19:47] church age he said i set before you an
[1:19:49] open door
[1:19:50] if you want to see the revelation here
[1:19:51] it is or he would build his church
[1:19:54] and the only way he could take his
[1:19:56] church is
[1:19:58] is back to the revelation of what he is
[1:20:00] all right
[1:20:02] now so an open door was put between the
[1:20:06] sixth and seventh church age
[1:20:09] and that door never did close
[1:20:11] that's right
[1:20:13] right
[1:20:15] it's the unfailing of the unveiling of
[1:20:17] the deity of jesus christ
[1:20:20] all right now when you come to patmos
[1:20:22] john knew the door
[1:20:25] he had done wrote of it in his own
[1:20:26] writings and his gospel
[1:20:28] and then he had come down to see an open
[1:20:30] door to the church agency
[1:20:33] a revelation of the deity of jesus
[1:20:35] christ
[1:20:37] all right
[1:20:38] now
[1:20:39] i didn't bring this one but i
[1:20:42] didn't mean to say it but i will
[1:20:44] according to christ a mystery of god
[1:20:46] revealed i'm pretty sure it's been said
[1:20:48] before
[1:20:49] brother brown says that the bride is
[1:20:52] part of the mystery
[1:20:54] and must be
[1:20:57] revealed
[1:20:58] amen
[1:21:00] right
[1:21:01] so now we go up at 4-1
[1:21:03] and we'll do this sunday so listen to
[1:21:05] the last few wording
[1:21:08] if the rapture takes place there and
[1:21:10] there's a prophet said she goes up in
[1:21:11] 4-1
[1:21:13] it is the revelation of the deity of
[1:21:15] jesus christ that will take us up that's
[1:21:17] right and where he's at in his church
[1:21:18] and what he's doing all right
[1:21:21] then we go up and then we see revelation
[1:21:24] 4 5 6 7 8 ten then
[1:21:29] it's just what i was saying while ago
[1:21:30] when he said abraham can i withhold
[1:21:32] anything from you
[1:21:33] no i'm gonna show it to you now
[1:21:38] he's not gonna withhold anything to you
[1:21:40] from you and i
[1:21:42] now there will be a message down to the
[1:21:44] endless ages after we leave here yes
[1:21:46] wonderful
[1:21:47] but what we need to get there is going
[1:21:49] to be made known while we're standing
[1:21:51] here
[1:21:52] it's not going to be that we're going to
[1:21:53] heaven and we're going to get so don't
[1:21:55] get the idea when we start sunday now
[1:21:58] that the bride goes up in 4-1 and not
[1:22:00] saying in 1921.
[1:22:04] that's what your prophet said don't get
[1:22:06] any thought and idea
[1:22:08] in your mind
[1:22:11] of some form of revealing different than
[1:22:14] what we're getting here
[1:22:16] that's right
[1:22:19] because we're going to get the
[1:22:20] revelation here
[1:22:22] if he wouldn't withhold it from abraham
[1:22:24] what do you think about his bride
[1:22:28] and see what i love about it like i've
[1:22:30] always like i've said to you how many
[1:22:31] times now already
[1:22:35] that he showed revelations 1 how
[1:22:38] beautiful
[1:22:40] a diamond
[1:22:41] picture of the bride of jesus christ
[1:22:46] before he ever even started telling
[1:22:48] about the things
[1:22:51] you know that's not going to change
[1:22:55] we just have a choice of whether or not
[1:22:57] we're part of it right that's it
[1:23:00] right
[1:23:01] it's our choice
[1:23:05] but the fact that it's already there
[1:23:07] brother gary
[1:23:10] that means somebody
[1:23:14] is going to get it
[1:23:16] why can't we believe we're the ones
[1:23:20] well it's impossible because we're just
[1:23:22] look who we are we're just the peons of
[1:23:24] the message you know we're just a little
[1:23:26] old
[1:23:33] i'm glad he said he would reveal it to
[1:23:35] babies
[1:23:37] such as would learn
[1:23:40] 40 years of preaching on it
[1:23:44] he had to change it yet
[1:23:48] see the same message amen
[1:23:52] see jesus christ
[1:23:54] now i see him more in bright form
[1:24:00] and remember brother gary when you said
[1:24:02] that to me you said i see the bride i
[1:24:04] said you can't see it without seeing him
[1:24:05] first that's right
[1:24:07] i didn't mean that derogatory to his
[1:24:08] revelation because his revelation was
[1:24:10] correct and i said you've got to see the
[1:24:13] see jesus
[1:24:14] then you can see jesus in the bride
[1:24:17] because you can't see the bride without
[1:24:18] the groom
[1:24:21] right
[1:24:23] sister gail poor thing she's even
[1:24:24] started looking like brother dick
[1:24:27] after 60 something years you start
[1:24:29] looking like each other
[1:24:39] but you see what i'm talking about
[1:24:40] church
[1:24:42] the same voice he said that called you
[1:24:44] charlie told you to turn around we'll
[1:24:46] one day call you come on it's not going
[1:24:47] to be a surprise that's right
[1:24:49] it's not going to be a different voice
[1:24:51] i'm not trying to find another voice
[1:24:55] i'm not trying to find some other
[1:24:57] supernatural great revelation to come
[1:25:00] forth by some of these brothers that's
[1:25:01] run through the field with look i've got
[1:25:03] it
[1:25:04] and i've always told you you know this
[1:25:06] is true i've always told you that one
[1:25:09] day
[1:25:09] they that are off the work
[1:25:12] will have signs and wonders
[1:25:15] so if we're built on signs and wonders
[1:25:18] we will follow the
[1:25:20] those people right out of the word
[1:25:26] right that's right
[1:25:28] because they will have signs and wonders
[1:25:29] that's what the bible says that's right
[1:25:30] people are the spirit upon all flesh
[1:25:34] your sons and daughters are my
[1:25:35] handmaidens
[1:25:37] so anointed ones will be going right
[1:25:38] along says look i told you i was right
[1:25:41] cause look what's happening
[1:25:46] i'm going
[1:25:49] brother dale you're not gonna join up
[1:25:50] with us
[1:25:53] they tried to put me in every camp they
[1:25:54] could so far i just hadn't found any
[1:25:56] that fit in i reckon
[1:26:01] because i just stand on what i believe
[1:26:03] that's right
[1:26:09] arrogant hateful i agree
[1:26:12] let me tell you let me tell you what you
[1:26:14] like
[1:26:18] that gets me done
[1:26:21] you know what i'm saying
[1:26:22] you look at me and you don't like me
[1:26:23] well that's okay i look at you don't
[1:26:24] like you either
[1:26:27] all right so we got any problem
[1:26:30] no
[1:26:33] but we're just trying to get to a place
[1:26:35] that's correct
[1:26:38] because listen folks
[1:26:42] i believe and i'm going to tell you what
[1:26:44] i believe
[1:26:46] i believe we will hear a voice calling
[1:26:48] us up that's right
[1:26:50] yes sir
[1:26:54] but it won't be like everybody's looking
[1:26:56] for right right
[1:26:59] it'll be just walking in the word until
[1:27:01] it just gets stronger and stronger and
[1:27:03] stronger
[1:27:04] and then we just walked right on off
[1:27:11] because the bride is going to be that
[1:27:12] final lord that's right
[1:27:14] come on brother
[1:27:16] take on these things
[1:27:20] an open door
[1:27:23] that will never again be shut
[1:27:27] but you see it will leave from us and go
[1:27:28] right on to israel
[1:27:32] go right on over to israel
[1:27:36] and still be revealing
[1:27:38] jesus christ to everybody
[1:27:43] we're going to stand here and see it
[1:27:45] before it comes into reality
[1:27:50] because we believe let's stand together
[1:27:53] take on december 15.
