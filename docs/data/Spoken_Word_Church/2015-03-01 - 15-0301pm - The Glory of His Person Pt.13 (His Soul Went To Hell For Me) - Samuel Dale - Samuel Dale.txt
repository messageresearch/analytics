where we're reading this morning from Revelations one in Genesis 1. and then job 33. try to continue our thought on remember the announcements the Lord willing brother Aaron will be preaching this coming Wednesday and then remember oh you better get richer to change or Aaron won it's almost Fanning and one's as Fanning that's sure the skinny ones so you better turn the air on somebody hat go ahead and do it Aaron and get it or Richard one get it they're going because it's we sure don't want that to happen we'd have people passing out no no but we just remember the announcement brother Aaron will be preaching the Lord Wednesday and then remember Saturday will be the Bible study we're still in the Book of Romans I think we're over to six or seven somewhere right in there in the book of Romans and having a good time fellowshipping together and all and just remember that and then remember the fellowship meeting will be here the third Saturday I think that's the 21st and brother Matthew Bray will be here with us for the weekend preaching the fellowship meeting in time so we you know we appreciate that we've already the Lord willing got things scheduled for this time for the watch not service because brother Forney will be with us the Lord willing preaching the watch Night Service this year I told him I was going to get ahead I just always called him and he said nothing okay I'll call you earlier so and then get early about it yeah that's the best way to do early bird gets the worm you know all right but we are we certainly have a good time you know always with the brother and fellowship and all right is that all the announcements I believe that's it remember now to the ladies that are fixing you've got the things that you you know for your food to bring for the fellowship meeting and things you know so get that together and get everything in order brother Al time will change this coming Saturday or okay this coming Saturday with a time will change Saturday night two o'clock in the morning get up and change the clock I generally changed mine before I go to bed to make sure that I don't I don't miss it but you know to do that amen I just we're going to go to Genesis I mean the revelations one then we'll go to Genesis 1. and then to job 33. Lord Jesus we love you we thank you we just ask you to help us because without your help it would be a meaningless gathering this afternoon and a nothing worth anything but will you and your presence Among Us to speak to our hearts and our lives to just try to remind the people of the things that has been said in your word and brought to us by your Prophet we thank you for these things and we just cherish all of it and Lord after all of these years of studying and reading and how we still coming more to more to find the most positive things of the message that has been brought to us and Lord we love you we thank you remember the sick among us Lord remember the sin sick because there are some that has allowed things to enter into and get in their way and make sin come into the to doing we pray that you just touch that take it away because only you can do those things we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen we'll start off with Revelations as it will skip over and get over to verse 12. and I turn to see the voice that Spate with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one likened to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the pouch with a golden girdle now we're still on the topic of our thought has been now for uh I think this is message number 13. that we've been talking about the glory of his person and we still haven't got over into the the point with the bride as much we're still trying to stay back and get everything laid in a foundation to where we can understand you know and get it into the order all right Genesis 1 26 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them now notice them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fall of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over ever creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created Man In His Image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them see a surprise to us is our thoughts a lot of times that it was only in the flesh man uh would you talk about you know Adam and Eve as being one you know and uh but you got a surprise she was in creation with him in the beginning are you done goofed up somewhere where'd she come from all right so whatever we see the image and whatever we see this creation that we talk about then remember Eve was a part of that and that's why that I've been so hard against all of these or them women ain't nothing but just don't byproducts and then I surely don't like the slang that to me is slanging I believe it can be Blasphemous to where the preachers will get up and say them all women ain't nothing but byproducts you're taking Walmart and they'll buy everything well they think that really makes a good something it does it makes stupidity into manifestation sorry that's just the way I think okay let's go to job 33 and 24. and he is gracious unto him and saith deliver him from going down to the pit I have found a ransom you may be seated the Lord and his Blessing to the reading of the word I know we won't get that far but we we're still driving you know to try to get a better understanding and I made the statement this morning and I I copied It Off to her that I had mentioned it you know we talk about there's no two forms of eternal life and then I wanted to give you these where you wouldn't uh think that I was just stating it actually one of them is our in our quotes today or the next week one but it's all for the message questions off of the message of Hebrews chapter 4. 57 901 brother Brandon said just think of it is there two Eternal lives you couldn't answer that could you there is one eternal life and that's the life of God this other kind of life no matter what it is it's got an end to it all right then he said it on questions and answers uh preaching 59 1223 there's only one form of eternal life and we're seeking for that and God alone has eternal life there's no two types of eternal life one eternal life and that's all that lives so think about these things you know there's no two Eternal lives there's only one eternal life well then you try to deal with this and deal with that you know you get it into trouble but no see to try to pick up the point this morning without backgrounding too far to where that we can look at it and we were trying to bring out then that you can see the uh in the creation you can see what the Creator is especially when you see that he is creating this man in His image you know and then his likeness uh brother Tony you know he don't never hardly ever say very much but sometimes you ought to sit down and listen to it you know when he speaks he generally speaks and uh he said you know said you take a seven inch tape player you know so that means real and said you transfer that over to an MP3 he said you got the same thing it was on the seven inch reel over here on an MP3 I said you're right you're right that's what I'm talking about all God was he poured into Christ and all Christ poured into the church that's that's where it's at that's what we're talking about the one true and living God is not being that you tear up the 17's real no it's still there as a matter of fact to Jeffersonville as far as I did years ago they used to still have all of the original seven inch reels you know that they still copy from that over on to the other things that was because they had the originals you know what they were doing no but think about it if we're created in the image of God then image means exact likeness and things and you could say well that really only means that we were created spiritual well that's good I believe that you know I believe God is a spirit I don't deny the scriptures or the thoughts I believe it you know I believe he's real and all but I I also know too that we found a lot more things as being unfolding down from to just say a spirit you know but I've told you over and over and I believe it I I don't believe that there was ever a time that he was just a spirit just floating around you know if something just and then he decides he's going to become tangibles that doesn't work with me because of one thing because it takes a lot of things to bring down and that's what I'm trying to speak about maybe it's a wrong word to say things or whatever but say forms it takes a lot of those forms to bring down the true understanding of God and you leave out any of it and you've left out a part of God you know because you're you're not keeping it in complete order but that way see then we the way that we're doing it talking about a man's a human being and we're not talking about this animal this is created in the image of animal now when we get to it we'll get on down to some more things probably not just today but remember that we were created in His image and that's spiritually speaking right all right but then we were created in the animal image physically speaking right all right now if you don't believe in the condescending of God what are you going to do with the fact of what we've got to deal with that he then would come in our image right you know he would come in our image he didn't come down looking like a martian that we think you know some kind of a weird looking animal stringy Tails or great big eyeballs and one in the middle and all the others you know he came down looking like a human being you know and you know what he cried like one you know when he was a baby like one you know he lived like one and you know he had to walk after the things of life well see then he come in our image to redeem us because that would be the only way that we could ever come back to that Redemption and that part that we read there in job where he said I found a ransom all right we'll get to that that deals with the soul of mankind and I say in this morning we we talk about this human body and we think it's so real until all we're pretty enough I got a spot right back there that my heart won't lay down and my wife she combs at every Sunday and she's got mad at me because I told her I said just I done combed it you know I mean to me take a scissors and cut it off I don't care it's back there I can't see that away you know and I don't it doesn't matter to me but you know we're human beings okay forget it oh but see to be created in the image of God and then God to come in our image is a wonderful thing it's really something great and you think about it that he would lower himself down to be one of us and I love the way the prophet explains that said he didn't send a son he didn't send another he said he came himself well no no I decided but he's still got to be up there you mean your God is so little until you think he's got some kind of a joystick that he's running this thing with this one keeps a moon rolling and that keeps the Sun going and that keeps this and he's got switches he's got to throw to keep the universe running and when he said let thy be amen amen that took care of it it'll run from now on until he decides what to do with it because he said let there be we're not playing with a little bitty silly koi ideas of mankind it was maybe a day when those things was all right because we had our own thoughts and our own ideas but the Bible says He commands all men to repent when the word comes through the lips or the prophet as we're saying this morning then we don't have any choice but to to stop and say okay there's no better way to explain it then that away well I if if if I'd been just if I'd have just been back there I could have explained it better forget it no when God said let there be light there was light that explained it you don't have to worry about it don't have to worry about where it come from I got a quote in here where brought around said where did he get that from or what did he do he said I don't know the Bible says something went to the order that the things we see were created by things of creative things that do not appear you know you can't find a place for it you can't decide what to do but think about it now let's get on and and maybe get into the thought that whatever image God was in that would be the image of the man that he would create all right and in creating that man it would bring into being all of the things that would ever happen none of this is by chance or Pro you know something uh he knew what it was going to be he knew if he created us we're going to go wrong he didn't have to get that figured out about the time he got down here and goofed up and said uh oh I messed up on making them you know but it did get pretty hard one time it said he repented you know that again he actually repented now I want to ask you the question who do you repent to you know but it does say that but see we take those things and try to calculate what it's all about it's statements to understand he might have said well but I do I I tell you what maybe I could have done it no other way but then he'd have to say nope couldn't be done no other way he knew all the things that was going to take place upon this Earth and he knew even to create Adam in His image and allow him to rule in the garden the animals me he still knew that that's that great one that was that away that placing down to bring everything into being that the man would mess up he knew that does that annihilate his great Superior thinking no it brings into manifestation the great understanding that he would have because I've got the notes are on some things my wife looks at Madison says my Lord you know because I'll have stacks of papers and run off and sitting here and here and here and and we'll get eventually maybe down to uh where were you when the morning star sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy you know and all like that we've been through those things before but we'll try to tie him in as we go along and get into the great understandings of that doing and those things took place before the foundation of the world all right maybe we'll get to that thought in a minute but the main things I'm wanting you to think about is like we read this morning the first creation was God himself the prophet said they're on questions and answers on Genesis paragraph 21. but that doesn't mean that he was a you know created something that simply means that he is moving from not changing what he is I seem to think that that's what we think a lot of time that here he was and he changed to you know to try to develop something down here I don't believe that I believe he was that and now in our understanding we are having to change our understanding to line up with what he has said and what he is and what he's always been all right because if he knew that if he made us and we'd go wrong it's the same thing of knowing it would go wrong he knew what he would do he already had the answer before the question come into being you know and that's what we're trying to find see and find this man that he creates and he's not talking about when he says let us make man our own image and likeness he's not talking about it I keep saying this body thing that we are you you've got to stay in Genesis 1 26 and 27 and on over into verse 28 to tie together but in Genesis 2 and 7 a man physically comes upon the Earth and that man then receives a name he didn't have a name until he comes into Adam you know flesh man he just says he created let's create man now we'll get to that more as we go along but you know maybe throw out a point and then get back to it later the ever person in the world has a soul all right in Ezekiel 18 4 he says All Souls are mine right and the prophet said All Souls were created before the world all right but he says he doesn't believe in pre-existence of Souls all right so now you've got to get it all tied together to understand that a lot of that was in his mind to come forth into a reality later on and Genesis 1 26 we'll read after a while is not just mankind created in His image I'm laying that out to start with it's not just all mankind it's not everybody a sinner can't fit in that category and hold together any point of thinking about 126 and 27. yeah he is in the image of God because he is a supernatural-like person to be the soul that's all right but he can't fit in 126 and 27. now lay that out ahead of time to where you can think about it till we get back to it and just like I was saying then when Adam the spiritual man Adam as we call him when he was in the garden where was Eve did he create her later or was she in the original creation I got the quotes from The Prophet so I don't have to worry about it he said she was in the original creation and said she was in the original Creation in Adam fleshly speaking but everybody wants the woman a horse you're just a byproduct she wasn't an original oh they think he got a great revelation and the people just Rejoice look Eve wasn't in there look at that and women just reaching look at that she went in in the preacher up there just calling her a bunch of dog meat and she's rejoicing well I don't want to be called dog meat you know I might find a dog that's hungry I'd rather stay as I am but that's what we think about you know that brother random said that when Adam was created physically the reason he was lonely all right got you thinking that but around them said Eve was still in theophthy when Adam was already physically made that's why I loved prophet's message it's got the answers I have a lot of questions myself you know but I know a God that's got all the answers now he may not give them all to us here on Earth that's all right you know I mean you know me and my wife before we married we sat down and we talked about a lot of things about you know being husband and wife and she didn't know nothing about me until she married me about 20 years later it took her about that long to figure me out and she ain't got me figured out yet really but I guess that's just part of life it takes time to understand right all right Brother Ray sister Kathy is looking at you she ain't got you figured out yet either okay but talking about in Revelation the glory of his person this person this one that created all things but now here's where we're going to enter for a little bit because I want you to think about it and then we're going to read some more quotes relating to what we're talking about this morning see then Genesis 1 26 man is not just a creation of Souls of all mankind that's only one person you've heard that statement before but if you ever let it sink in the 126 man is just one person if you don't believe it that way I ask you a question then we'll run around and said that Adam was putting flesh he said he was still in theophany well you're trying to say then that Adam and Eve had the same soul in theophany because there's only one soul when you're speaking of theophany now when you're speaking of people there are many many Souls people that'll give you something to chew about all right we'll get down to those things but think about it we know for a surety that Jesus being almighty God and that he was the creator himself because you would go into trinitarianism if you have God to create Jesus as we'll read in a minute where he says it and then Jesus create everything else that's what basically most people think and uh but either he was God in another form called a son or you got a trinitarian Doctrine if you got two people you got a trinitarian Doctrine because there ain't no other place to put them but if you got one person as we read not the first person but the person we quoted this morning out of the unveiling of God if you can see that then you can hold a point to where that when you watch eternal life then I have no problems whatsoever with the statements brother random said you always was eternal boy that strobe haywire and the message people of all kind of realms but it's very simple check the message he said if you have eternal life you always was eternal what eternal life always was eternal that's no problem is it like in the scripture where it says his seed remaineth in you then you cannot sin yet the scripture says we sin every day now see it all ties together we get it in the right place but if not then we we run Haywire with it and we we read a lot this morning especially there from questions and answers in Genesis to where he was speaking about how that God was the first creation and then out of that came the logos and logos down to the man and he created that man but remember the man he's speaking of there is a 126 man because then you put it into flesh at a later time in 2-7 and Eve is still left over here and Adam is down here but that's only Eve's theophany because her body's down here right then God removes that from Adam that we talk about the rib to make a body and he puts that theophany in that body me got a lot to talk about haven't we may be in the Millennium will comprehend a lot of things but let's stay with this reading a little bit as the prophet trying to express it unto us and maybe these words will not be so odd as we go along so go ahead brother and let's pick up number four there of the message where it's a message called who is God and that's really a great message to get into and study it because it's basically questions and answers on Genesis with you know basic same route mine wouldn't play too good so I couldn't use it but I got a lot of quotes off of it so he goes to e16 so he first was god Jehovah and out of him let's just picture now as a little drama so you can get it let's see coming out of space where there's nothing let's make it a little white light like a Mystic light like a Halo and that was the logos that went out of God in the beginning that was the son of God that came out of the bosom of the father remember the scripture said no man is saying guarded in it but the bosom the sun has declared it out of the bosom see the sun declares you know it's not another person that was what was in the beginning was the word now I want you to take on that right there that was the son of God that came out of the bosom with the father they said we want to take John 1 and break it in Genesis 1. right where it says and God created heaven and earth now the word was on back before all of that all right look what he says came out of the Muslim that was what was the beginning was the word what when the sun came out of the bosom with the father that was what was in the beginning was the word you remember we argued that when we were trinitarians in the beginning was the word word was with God well we had two of them at least and then somebody said but the next part of it said and the Word was God oh we're back down to one again but brother random takes it before the foundation of the world that was that was in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in the beginning was God then out of God came to logos a part of God that went out of God raise it on up going back into a little picture of drama now see this is just like a child playing before the door it was the son of God below gosh and I can see him out there and he spake and said let there be light and there was nothing but there was something happened and an atom burst and Adam Turner excuse diary and begin to whirl around this away the sun began to come into existence because he said let there be there's the authority where did he get it to to make it from I don't know there was nothing to make it from but he believed his own word you know he believed his own word and he said and there was light all right let there be who said that now according to the Bible and according to our understanding Jesus Christ is the creator of all things not Jesus the flesh no no Jesus the Christ amen well then Jesus of Christ must be God or else you have a trinitarian concept me so you got to realize and see then that you're not talking about when the sun came out that that's another person comes up here's this person is like brother Tony said you got every bit of this coming down over here you know you got every bit it was back there it just comes over here and then now we're just seeing it develop into something that we can comprehend all right we'd like a child before the father's door he says what greater terminology could that be because Church whether you believe in or listen to it or think about it you're Oneness people have a lot more truth in the quoting of the scriptures than your trinitarian concept but yet it can't be the one that's Doctrine and by not being able to be the one that's Doctrine you've got to keep Father Son and Holy Ghost to have your one God do you take away any part of that and what have you done then there's no problem then with the baptism and Jesus standing here and here comes a dove floating down and here's the voice and speaking up here there's no problem then with Jesus speaking to his father are praying I'm saying glorify me with the glory that we had before the foundation of the world because he's not a trinitarian but he's not just a Oneness over here come on over here and let's come on over here you have to keep it to where you can keep that being because if not then who do you pray to as I was talking about this morning why do you pray out loud you got God in you and don't worry about it God can hear your thoughts remember our thoughts are louder in heaven than our words are on Earth but that still doesn't do away without with us praying does it because what is prayer it's a communication right he starts pouring out our heart even Jesus prayed in the garden until his blood became his blood sweat became his blood agony praying right see we want to get it all in a lump sum and then we say that's too deep no it's too simple there is nothing in God deep that's the problem we make it deep it's too simple to understand like I've always said you know you're talking about The Stumbling Stone a rock of offense and you get out on a football field and and you standing in the middle and you got that 100 yards by what how wide 50 60 yards wide or something and there's nothing out there but a half inch grass and you're out there looking for a rock you're just trying to find one and you walk along you stumble and fall down then what was that oh that's the Rock see that's how our stupidity goes that we're doing it but see it's a lot Rock of offense that stumble at the word this Prophet brought things so simple until it's amazing how simple had he been a theologian logical words and terms none of us would have been able to follow it yet he brought it down in and had to use their words of logos theophany you know this that or the other but as he did it was brought into simple terminologies that you and I could understand was he just making like a little Halo of light a little Halo of light just goes out that was the sun see when we look at it like trying to find a son we say well see in our minds a lot well the sun went out of the father and here goes here stands a person over here person over here it's not that way he just took a form stepped over into it and said let there be think about it Church God trying to condescend to mankind descending that we could comprehend him right and as he does he does starts and he uses forms he uses words and things and he's like a child run around and said on the pillar of fire like a child playing before the father's door well then was he a little bitty baby was this one that created a little bitty baby he was like a child what does he simply saying degrade eternal could remain as great and honorable and thoughtful as to what he is and yet not a part of him going out is we try to make it look like but just that he changes a form to reveal himself and not a little bitty baby playing before the father's door because you'll hear Brother Branham then he's saying says then he has in his mind what he's going to create and he says let there be and so things begin to appear a little baby no I really enjoyed it one time when we were down at the Atlanta third The Passion Play and the only time they ever done it because they said it was copyrighted they couldn't use it for one time but it had a part of a scene and then it you know if you remember those things that would start with a certain scene at different ones and they had a part of a scene and then all at once they had like there was nothing and it's a good way of doing it they kept pulling these things back and forming rocks and doing things because there was a voice saying let there be well just for a minute it viewed that person just for a minute the next scene was transforming 4 000 years you know over and a baby crying in a cradle and then it comes up from that to a grown man all right just trying to illustrate something that grown man was the same man that had stood back there and said let there be that's what he looked like darn is what he looked down here can't you see then that's the way God is he's simply trying to reveal himself to you and I as the great Eternal God that has covered all space-time and Eternity as the prophet would say it and letting us understand how he would come into being right and if he did then as I said it wouldn't be then that we would think about God over here and then Jesus comes over here either Jesus was God let me quote the prophet either Jesus was God or the greatest Deceiver the world has ever known it's his words that he was either God or the greatest Deceiver but when he said I and my father are one he said Philip have I been so long with you have you seen me you've seen the father you know so what does the father look like must look like what we're standing there you know because that's what he was right now if he came himself then we're right in the truth of understanding and we're not Oneness he came himself but the way he came would make it to her that he doesn't have to do away with this form to come into this form all of those attributes all those things were still in God but see we can't didn't turn around and do like the prophet said go ahead with number six the word you've read this before and we did the other day but it's taken from 336 of the lady you see in church hey our church age book or the beginning of the creation of God that is what that is who the Lord Jesus says he is but those words don't mean exactly as they sound to us just taking them the way they sound has made some people in fact multitudes of people get the idea that Jesus was the first creation of God making him lower than godhead than this first creation created all the rest of the universe and whatsoever it contained but that is not right you know that doesn't line up with the rest of the Bible the words are he's the beginner or author of the creation of God now we know now we know for a surety that Jesus is God very God he's a Creator their next Parts below there he said he's the Genesis one Genesis 1 1 you know and then he brings it down to um in uh numbers I believe it is where he said in six days he created and he brings it right on down to seeing who that is but do we believe it now we're back to that old saying that people likes do we really need to understand this you know do we really need to understand God my brother said it like this he said we had talked about some things and he said well you know what it don't matter as long as I get to heaven well I thought about the quote that the prophet made when he said that most people just want to miss hell is the reason they want to serve God they just want to miss going to hell all right but you see you say well what does it matter it matters so much until I wish you would remember that the things that I'm reading and inviting you to read and study is what your Prophet spent 30 something years bringing right but it wasn't important we don't need to understand that he spent his entire life trying to preach to us about this God that we claim well we don't need to know about that well what do we need we just need salvation that's what I'm trying to preach because if it wasn't salvation I was trying to preach then then we would just all go home and be happy about being that God created us in His image if he created us in His image then he ain't going to destroy us so we're all going to heaven no because you see the man that he created whoever you want to blame father Creed the Fall just still remember the man fell right you know that put us on the other side away from God Amen the Great Gulf is fixed between us if there's only one can bridge that Gap to bring it back and that would be God hath to come himself and that's what I'm talking about the coming of God coming into view coming into understanding to you and I and to believe that he's real not to just well he's just see that's what most people think that's what I used to think I know what you think maybe not as bad as I do but I know what you think but we used to think well he's just a spirit or something he's just some kind of something and all at once that's some kind of something said well I'll send down my son and I'll let him die so he sins of Flesh and like they're saying in the message today that God didn't die you know that that wasn't God he just was a man and then God came on him and then God left him and he died a man the best you can deal with in that is to think about if it was just a man then we're still in our sins unless that man was God but around said no man can die that away the way he died he said then it had to be God well my God my god oh Glory as your Prophet said he died oh I know a little bit too I know it's on the unveiling of God where he said he acted as either that or gone and the unveiling of God or it's one of those about the unveiling that goes on over that that run around and says this way he said he acted the part of death well art that's true but see that's where you don't see him as being real where do we get down to it when we get to dealing with that body spirit and soul you know there was a man walked on the shores of Galilee that claimed to be God and you know he had a body had a spirit he had a soul and you know that body of his could be tempted well says in all points that we are then you gotta well get off of it and go on brother Dave because it's got to be revealed all right this man that was created in Genesis not talking about the two seven now follow me I'm talking about that talking about the 126 and 27 man the spiritual man all right this man was created and the prophet said that he was in the image of God the Bible says he was in the image of God the prophet said he led the animals as the Holy Spirit leads us today and said that he was then a theophany man we go Haywire trying to figure that out because we can read and we read over in the Corinthians back up a minute where it talks about that we have this body waiting but I want to ask you a simple question it says there that that body is waiting eternal in the heavens do you have eternal life do you I'm asking you you know you could at least answer yes okay if you have the new birth you have eternal life right now I didn't mean for this to come out that way it's just a good way of it coming out but remember there is no two Eternal lies is that what we read to start with there is no two Eternal lives so then if you got eternal life and yet eternal life is up in heaven this you something wrong there sounds wrong I know the quotes from the prophet he said already there agreed I agree with that but I agree with where there's not no two Eternal lives and see I happen to be one of the old schools that believes that you've got to be born again to have eternal life I mean I'm sorry that's just the way I believe it I believe that you didn't come into the world with eternal life we'll get to Adam and blasphemous names if you want to read some there go with that I know that brother Branham and what he taught not all of it but I know enough to say a few things I know that that man Adam that was in the garden wrote around and said especially upon Adam eternal life well that simply must mean that there was somewhere that man that was standing there the two seven man didn't have eternal life because the Bible said in God breathed into his nostrils then he become a living soul but I also know that he breathes breath into the nostrils of every baby that comes into the world because that has to come from God right but I also know that that was a the only time he done it was in Adam the rest of mankind didn't get eternal life because you'd have an eternal sinner then the next baby that came with eternal life was Jesus Christ hey all right it would come out to be correct so let's think about this man that we're talking about go over number seven let's read a little bit brother random we've read this over and over as a matter of fact this is the one that's got to quote up above it about the eternal life paragraph 230 he said was God a man certainly let us make man in our own image what was God a theophany a body and there was no man like that excuse me and there was excuse me let me just get the reading right and our man was made like that and put Over the Garden but there was no man to till the soil in the senses then he created man Out of the Dust of the Earth in the animal life and that man till the soil and the man fell by transgression correctly and God the theophany come down and was made flesh and dwelt among us to redeem the man Simple Plan of Redemption all right so then God was the theophany so he made demand the theophany right go ahead to the next one which is number eight the darkest hour then Jesus comes along paragraph e25 she's talking about he pulled him and talking of of G of Mary uh or Napoleon from Jesus the lady at the whale I think but listen she pulled from him virtue through that human body of his God he was just a man we'll see how brother Dale he's just a man look mourned of a woman but his father was God but in his body he was a man okay that's right look in his spirit he was God foreign his body the creation Hebrews 10 5 right into the wound of Mary coming forward but his Spirit was almighty God we're talking about this man over here now bringing him down to try to help us we ain't got back there with a man of Adam yet just hold on all right look at the next one you remember there in body he was a man in his Spirit he was God he goes to the God keeps his word paragraph 76 I believe that Jesus is the son of God I believe that in body he was a man he was born of a woman just like I was now now we know that ain't right to say that he was born sinful and brought about by sex right so we're not talking about that he's talking about he come from a mother he comes through the wound get it right because he said what but his blood was not of a woman it was of God and Jehovah God the logos who brewed over the Earth in my messages this morning and brewed the first man Out of the Dust of the earth overshattering Mary and brood over her to fulfill his word and created the blood cell that brought forth the son of the Living God I believe in body he was a man I believe in his soul he was God he was God's manifestation here on Earth God was in Christ reconciling him the world to himself I believe that he was not just a mere man neither was he a prophet he was God Emmanuel I believe that with all of my heart what who he is twin body it was a creation which was the blood of God right no DNA connection to the human race nah come on you could have run his blood and it was red you could have run it it may have had a top but get what the point is it's the blood of God it was a created blood not a human element brought by mankind and definitely we know it's not the Virgin Mary that produced The Egg and God supplied the sperm Etc you know nah we don't go with them things either we go with the truth see but what about now in body he's a man in spirit he's God in body he's a man in Soul he was God then when that man was born there brought into this world he was Body Spirit and soul look at the next and works its Faith expressed now remember you're in a cycle of three but you're one person like Father Son and Holy Ghost cycle of three the one person three attributes of the same God fatherhood three offices like fatherhood sonship and Holy Ghost and you are Body Spirit and soul now for a part of us being here if we're Body Spirit and soul and God comes in our image what is he right so body Hebrews 10 5. which was a creation of God's word spirit and soul not just some man right the soul and the spirit was God the flesh was a creation see the outside body has five inlets to it to contact your Earthly homes he taste feels about here the inside which is the spirit it has five senses conscious and love and so forth but the inside of that the soul as one thing that's where you live now if we are body I want to take this for a minute and then we'll quit if we are as a human being a body a spirit and a soul right all right then if God came in our image then he's Body Spirit and soul right and what happened yeah but my God can't die God never the what we talk about God or he can't die that's fine my God can't die no God can't die but he went to the part of what we call death he acted that part according to the unveiling of God or either the Mighty God unveiled before us that's the other one I was trying to get one ago one of those two he said he acted the part of death now here's quotes that we'll get to if you need them but right around said God tore that soul out of that body that looks like he just got so mad at him or whatever he just no no no no no simple sense what happened to that man that we call Jesus on the cross he was hanging there he was back in the garden showing you who he is he was back in the garden he said or not in the garden he was coming up when it comes with a quotation over there something else in a minute he said now it's my soul troubled but for this reason in other words he said his soul was troubled so he had a soul he said into thy hands I commend my spirit so there's a spirit there but don't just make him just any kind of a spirit because we'll show where the Prophet when we get back to it where he talks about that this spirit that was in him was the spirit that spoke through the prophets so it's not just an ordinary spirit and a man and in a soul that happened to be something no the body was a creation all you got to do I can't kill you you can't kill nothing we haven't been through that but when that soul and that Spirit stepped out of that body you got the quotes where the Prophet said it he said his Spirit went back to God who gave it he said his soul went to hell to preach to this old in prison he said that he was born out from Resurrection for three days because the word said it huh he said then when that time was done said his Spirit was released went to his soul and his soul to his body and said he stood in the resurrection he said that's what happens to you amen amen he said when you die your spirit goes to God who gave it says your soul goes under the altar where I saw those the other day yeah and he said your body goes to the Grave and said one day said that spirit will be released when the things are fulfilled it'll go to that soul and that soul to that body and he said you'll stand upon the Earth right well we believe that there's somebody going to be standing here right because of the scriptures and the prophet's word that don't have to go to that grave but around him says we take this body to meet the theophany what's up yonder folks this right here is taking you to your theophany the fullness of God you say well what about the word it says about the you know the the uh we have a body waiting read the scripture it says if this Earthly Tabernacle were which is two questions it's done been asked dissolved we have one waiting are you there now who is this Melchizedek you'll find an outstanding statement the prophet is talking about the theophany and he said we don't have that body yet he's already taught you your theophan is your soul he said we bypassed our theophany to come to flesh so there must be a little bit more about this that we need understanding we'll hold to that but I had a bunch of quotes there to show you what it was and let me just read that and then we'll quit come ahead Brothers I can read while y'all are getting up here I hope I got him in here come ahead musicians well we got the communion now that's right just hold it hold it we got the communion you can let up your screen okay in job 33 24 we read I have found a ransom in Exodus 30 and 12 is talking about the sum of the children of Israel after their number and they shall give Every Man a ransom for his soul and to the Lord they even knew a lot about it to her Psalms 40 and 9 verse 7. none of them can by any means redeem his brother nor give to God a ransom for him so we can't do it gonna be a kin folks right Matthew 20 and 28. even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many First Timothy 2 and 5 and 6. there is one God and one mediator between God and Men the man Christ Jesus who gave himself a ransom for all right what was that Ransom it's not the price of the body the price of the Soul I want to ransom for my soul don't you I want to ransom for my soul let's stand together we'll go into the communion because the Bible said to Soul at sinneth is what would I not the body not the spirits we're dealing with it's a soul First Corinthians 11 23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you it's due in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is a new testament in my blood this new year as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do shoot the Lord's death till he come or for whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat that bread and drink of that cup for he did Edith and drinketh unworldly Edith and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this caused many are weak and sickly among you in many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged now I love this but when we are judged it's not just Cast Away when we are judged we are chastened to the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherever my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together in the condemnation the rest will I said in order when I come let's just have a few moments of Silent prayer praying one for the other and especially you pray for me I pray for you and we pray that the Lord would bless and help us and keep us and guide us on into his word that we need because I'm looking forward to getting on the other side I've always made a statement to you that I believe just what we're great understanding we're getting here is just going to be a foundation when we get over there to be able to understand with because it's going to be a wonderful time to get together and listen to the word what about sitting down listening to the Lord Jesus himself he tried to talk to them disciples didn't he they couldn't understand him the best he could do in explaining everything finally brought a statement from one of them it says now we know that nobody has to tell you anything they had finally caught on to some things and neither that or one point there the Lord said do you mean to you now believe you know well see I think it's about the time that we at least we can start saying we do believe don't you that we've been around quite a while in studying the word of the Lord and we ought to do that but let's just pray and just pray one for another silently remember Wade there because I know they're finished up now over there and there are probably uh late in the night because it's different in the time but we just pray that the Lord would bless I hope he'll get to do it I did when I was over there we had communion and I really enjoyed that because they had the communion and the foot washing while I was there I enjoyed it into that country you know been able to do it in Jamaica been able to do it in Ireland and been able to do it in the Philippines I'd love to go to all these countries and just have that communion foot washing with the brothers and sisters because it'd be a great time right but let's pray thank you all right we thank you Father for your word and your truth and I just may our hearts Rejoice upon what we see and be able to follow in you as we're going into this part here of the the communion Lord we pray that you'd make us all worthy because it is not what we can do to make ourselves worthy no matter what we could do we wouldn't be but yet you can do a simple act as you've done to cleanse away everything to where we're worthy to take the communion so we ask you to do that now in Jesus name the Bible said he took bread and blessed it father we thank you for this bread it's been made for this purpose this afternoon and now we come to the place of asking you that it's just a representation of your actual body that was given for each one of us and the word that has been made available to each one we ask you that you would just come down sanctify this bread and the partakers in Jesus name you know you think about what happened in that upper room and you think about the the time of the Lord Jesus expressing these things to the disciples they didn't understand all of it but they followed it you know and they saw what it happened and they knew that something was taking place and that they were had the ability to sit there and see it and to realize then maybe they didn't realize when he said you know this is my body but later on the Apostle Paul was able to take it and break it down they understood enough to know to do it but they needed understanding and so do we father we ask you to sanctify this wine to the partakers that the wine Lord symbolic of your blood that was shed for each one of us and as we eat the little piece of bread we drink this little bit of wine tomorrow it'll be blood cells in our bodies to help us to live there is something literal about this but yet we want to see the spiritual Lord of understanding that communion like brother Bob's been trying to express downstairs is to Fellowship it's to to sit down and the prophet said a lot of times we we pray but we don't listen for God to speak to us and that way he can't fellowship with us so we just ask you to have your way with us forgive our sins cleanse us sanctify the wine in Jesus name I know it was the blood I know it was the blood and I know it was the blood for me one day when I was lost he died upon the cross and I know it was the blood for their knee it was Emmanuel's blood and it was Emmanuel's blood it was a man who was blood for me one day when I was lost he died upon the cross and I know it was a blood for me I know it was Supply I know it was the blood I know it was supposed for me one day when I was lost he died upon the cross and I know it was a blood for me I know it was the blood I know it was a blood I know it was your blood for me one day when I was lost he died upon the cross and I know it was the blood for me what about the people of this message that are so great revelated you know and I'm not making light I'm just telling the truth but there's people that quit taking communion okay and the reason they quit taking communion because it says to do this till I come and they said well he's already here he come in 63. with a pillar of fire and out there in in Arizona you know so we don't take the communion no more now that's great Revelation isn't it and really spend probably hours rebuking people who do take communion you know are talking about them and low rating them you know and how to dirt and filthy we are for not understanding foreign but you know the prophet said that when we get there the marriage supper is going to be the communion right he said be the communion well I'd sure love to be here taking communion and then just right there you know chained in a moment a twinkling of an eye and just stepped right over into that place and take the communion wouldn't you wouldn't that be a great opportunity let's all partake together you can be seated for a moment while we're getting ready we read the scripture from John 13. for the foot washing supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas iscari Simon's son to betray him so if we're coming to the foot wash and then you know Simon took part of the communion and then turned around and denied the Lord Jesus Cody is still here at the foot washing you know and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas is Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands that he was coming from God and went to God he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a dowel and girded himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel wherewith he was girded then cometh heed of Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him Lord just I washed my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do that I know it's not now but thy shalt know Hereafter Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou has no part with me Simon Peter saith unto them Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head I'd like to stop there and preach about an hour or two on what I was saying this morning that today that in spirit and body we can get offended but if your soul is right you will not get offended in your soul is that what this man done because Jesus answers it if I wash thee not thou has no part with me Peter immediately seen wait a minute there's something here that needs to be right Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my feet only but I'll throw my hands in my head she just said to him he that is worse neither is not saved or wash his feet with his clean every wit and you are not clean and and you are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he you are not all cleanse oh Judas was still sitting there with me so after had washed her feed and then taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know you what I've done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also want to wash one another's feet and I've given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do them let's Stand Together if you know him we'll do them Judas you know but of course everybody's got their great Revelations hasn't it do you know that some people believe that they had the foot washing first and that way Judas could leave and then had the communion last and in a Minister's meeting we was having one time and they were just man they were just arguing like everything I finally I said brother moat would you mind telling us what they done at the Tabernacle he said they had communion and had foot washing I said problem solved we don't need to discuss it no more but that's what they were if you had foot washing first that's a great Revelation see oh wonderful yeah don't work too good all right before we go I need to make this announcement too now men boys children are you're not to go in the room downstairs where the women are having their foot washer some men have one in there oh you want your coffee you got it I'll call you well you just remember if we have to we'll put a deacon down there and he'd give you all the coffee he wants to over the top of your sassy old head don't try to go in that room while the women's having their foot washing okay but I need to get my stuff out there you would have got it out this morning don't do it I make it Stern I try to make it easy and say don't do these things don't do it and people are just gonna run on well don't do it well how the Deacon standing down there and he'll throw you out of the building because that women are doing they can open the door when they get through right I don't care how wonderfully great you are it don't have no difference you think you're the smart alec no I'll just be that more smart adequately don't do it okay you wait until then women open the door then you might you ask before you go in there don't go stumbling through their employment well I didn't know it yeah you know it now you call that heart sarcastic and hateful if you want to I call it one thing when our kids needed a spanking they didn't get it while I was grinning right they got it when I kind of got a little bit upset with him and he got a little spanking well I think that's where we'll do with everything Lord Jesus you forgive us and say anything that wouldn't be right of you but Lord we try to make it hard for people to not do it and then silly people just go right on because they're so great none of us are great Lord we serve and honors and there's friends here God who recompense all things back unto us and if we do these things according to our own natures and our ways then we can expect the recompense of God back to us Lord help us to be Earnest and sincere and to be ahead of you we love you and we thank you be with everybody on the way home give a safe journey once we're through take care of everything guide us in Jesus name amen you're dismissed
