========================================

oh um so this morning i want to kind of take a little thought about that scripture that we just read um first thessalonians 4 16 for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shallow the voice of the archangel with the trump of god and the dead in christ arise first but instead of that scripture not now as we as we go along think about how you know paul as we read up paul keeps making references to the coming of the lord he's talking about how he wants the believers to live sanctify lives and live lives holy to the lord and and and teaching them how to work and how to live and um how to how to be christians because uh the whole point of the ministry i believe is is is to get people into a place where they can have their own personal relationship you know the whole saying about um if you teach a man to fish he can feed himself he can uh you know he can he'll he begins to learn how to teach teach somebody how to study the bible and how to pray and and you know one uh john pulled some up and then uh uh iranians and polly cochran polycarp and then pulled others up and just all down through history it's just one chain of of god working in people to pull keep pulling each other up teaching teaching how to live and how to do a live a holy life a god working in the believers so let's turn to john chapter 11 and read maybe a strange strange scripture and before we read this is lord jesus we thank you god for your grace to us another day to serve you and thank you god for the beautiful weather lord we come today on this day that's not just the roman the s-u-n day but the s-o-n day the day that you rose lord jesus and i pray god that you'll rise in our hearts to understand your word and god granted that you'll be with the services today lord be with brother wayne's sister junior as they travel and minister lord god granted that you'll give them travel and mercies on the way back and all the ones that can't be with us today lord grant that we ask in the name of the lord jesus christ so john chapter 11 let's let's kind of uh just take a second and read through the whole thing just so we get a little or almost we'll see where we stop how far we get just to kind of get the picture of what's going on now a certain man was sick named lazarus of bethany the town of mary and her sister martin it was that mary which anointed the lord of the ointment and wiped his feet with her hair his brother landed us a city therefore his sister sent unto him saying lord behold he whom thou lovest is sick when jesus heard that he said this sickness is not under death but for the glory of god that the son of god might be glorified thereby now jesus loved martha and her sister in lazarus when he had heard therefore that he was sick he above two days still in the same place where he was then after that saith he to his disciples let us go into judea again his disciples said to him master the jews of lake sought to stone thee and go us thou there again jesus answered are they not 12 hours in the day if any man walk in the day he stumbled up because he seeth the light of this world but if a man walk in the night he stumbled because there was no light in it these things said he and after that he saith unto them our friend lazarus sleepeth but i go that i may awake him out of sleep then said his disciples lord if he sleep he shall do well howbeit jesus spoke of his death but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest and sleep then said jesus unto them plainly lazarus is dead and i am glad for your sakes that i was not there to the intent you may believe nevertheless not let us go unto them then it said thomas which is saudimas unto his fellow disciples let us also go that we may die with him then when jesus came he found that he had lain in the grave four days already now bethany was nine to jerusalem about 15 furlongs off and many of the jews came to martha and married and come for them concerning their brother their brother then martha as soon as she heard that jesus was coming went and met him but martha mary sat still in the house then said martha unto jesus lord if thou has been here my brother had not died but i know that even now whatsoever i will ask from god god will give it thee jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again martha saith unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection of the last day jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth thou this she saith unto him yea lord i believe that thou art the christ the son of god which should come into the world now let's just stop there her confession and go back and kind of set the stage for this story because now paul and that thessalonians is teaching us the the church he's talking about taking a bite and that's the whole what you know i believe the bride every church that kind of has a specialty luther had his specialty was was uh the the place that he had come to in in the body the light that had been revealed was justification and as you move on up wesley saw sanctification but now we have a specialty and you know you can preach about um uh all the different topics about a little bit loving one another and being good and things all those are needful but the bride in this day has a specialty a special focus of of try of taking a body change and that's what our our special focus is and so when we when we read the scripture where i believe we're reading it trying to get an understanding of how we can take a body change and that's what rapturing faith is raptured faith is a revelation that you can take a body change and that's why we study that's why we go to church that's why we listen to the tapes that's why our our focus is you know brother graham said that the whole the evidence of being born again was that you'd be in the word all the way all the way because you're desperate trying to find out how to get so full of god until god can reveal to you and make it known to you that yes you can take a body change and you will take a body change and you know i believe that uh the bride can come to a revelation will come to a revelation before the body change happens that she is going in it there won't be any any guesswork like all of a sudden you well i i hope you know years ago we kind of hoped maybe maybe it was a little bit i hope so that i hope i'm going to take it but i believe we're coming to a place where we are going to know that we're going to take it that's right that god is doing something personal and personal in our lives that he's revealing something you know uh years ago i remember this story about uh uh well actually my wife was telling me she was at a youth camp where they got all the uh the minister whatever got all the ministers up on stage and said now i want all the ministers to raise up your hand if you uh every time you sometimes you're not sure that you know the devil will tell you you're not sure that you have the holy ghost and maybe you have a little question now i believe that when you get the holy ghost that god can reveal it to you that you know that you have the holy ghost there's not a uh well i you know it's not based on feelings because you have bad days and you have good days and you have you know ups and downs and uh you know gets a little sniffle on things but when god reveals to you that you have the holy ghost it's a revelation of what he's done for you that's why you can't tell somebody i can't tell any of you that you have the holy ghost because it's got to be a personal revelation even when god reveals it to you and it's anchored so far down in unt you know that you know and i believe that's how that's how healing is too if you believe that and you know that god has healed you then as you know brother brown talked about the the little wheel of faith and the big will of god's power and when they get spinning like like the two cogs your little will of faith i believe god's word i believe what he says gets spinning with god's big will of the power of god then it gets moving in conjunction and and something's bound to happen something that's going to happen because you you're resting on god's word god has revealed something to you and nothing in the world can can happen it can stop it if you believe god is able to hear you and has healed you and if he reveals that to you that it's got to happen in the same way with the rapture if he reveals it to you then it's got to happen i believe that now a certain man was sick named lazarus of bethany the town of mary and her sister martha now now i i it's interesting if you if you look at what scholars say a so-called scholar now we believe in a scholar that did not go to any any kind of theological seminary or anything but this man got his education just like you know john the baptist went out into the wilderness because when his parents died his little offering ran out of the wilderness began to eat locusts and wild honey and he got education not from some seminary but by god himself coming and revealing himself to him and this man you know got an education that just confounded the world because he didn't get it from from some teaching he got it from an experience with god and he so the theologists of the day say well jesus was on his way to jerusalem but now brother randall said he was in bethany and then he left and when he left lazarus got sick but jesus was there he was there not now kind of i you know you can you can type a lot of things that i don't want to over type and and uh but i i believe you can kind of look at this because i you know look at the first four books of the bible matthew mark luke and john lyon ox man eagle and the eagle that now john in the book of revelation he saw not just the eagles sitting on the perch but he saw he said the fourth beast looked like a flying eagle it wasn't an eagle sitting up somewhere but it was flying it was up high now the first the first three are rooted on the ground or earthly and then the fourth is taking us up into the heavenlies and that's what john's doing here he's painting a picture of something that that to show us something in the something higher to catch us up because god's always pulling us up he's pulling us up jacob's ladder he's pulling us up into a real where we can catch the revelation and fulfill the word for our day now a certain man will sit named lazarus of bethany the town of mary and her sister martha now bethany has a strange meaning it means beth means house and annie means sorrow and uh now now look uh let me uh let me read genesis 3 16. y'all don't have to turn there i'll just read it for you because we're all living in a house of sorrow in genesis 3 16 he told the woman unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband he shall deliver thee and under adam he said because now he's hearkened under the voice of thy wife and as eaten over the tree of which i commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat it cursed is the ground but i say in sorrow shall that eat of it all the days of our life because of what they had done they were living in sorrow now the whole of humanity was dwelling in this house of bethany uh no just to paint a picture now when you type something you there's some things in the type that don't don't maybe uh you know joseph was not jesus christ but you know you can look at his life and kind of figure out how the the learn some things you know the the woman with leaven was was not the kingdom of heaven look at that story and learn about the kingdom of heaven by looking at that type now you can look at this type of how lazarus now down in the in the investment uh there was this family who was who was going through this little situation this little story and and uh lazarus when jesus was there in in bethany and then he left now let me read the reading of this quote where uh brother branham said that jesus was there uh and then jesus came and called 1964. now in this case jesus had been told to the father to leave the home and to go away if you notice how it worked they after lazarus took sick and no doubt many of them said oh now let's see where that holy preacher is now that's going to pray for the sick he isn't on the scene and then i'm just get down to perry 49 now when jesus left the home why that death and trouble set in now jesus left the home he was there and then he then he was there prison and then he left now and that's not typing anything bad or anything but now jesus was walking that he was present in the in the beginning in the first church age he was present walking and veiled in flesh and then as soon as he left they began to get a little get a little off the beaten path he said the message in revelation to the to the first church age was you've left your first love you forgot your first love and it they began to get a little sick they got they got uh they had lost the the love for christ and it got began to get a little away and they got sicker and sicker and sicker until the fourth church age death was present because uh you know they began the seed had to go into the ground so that it could come forth again now to see the the same kind of where i'm going at verse 2 it was that mary which anointed the lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother lazarus was sick therefore his sister sent on them saying lord behold he whom thou lovest is sick now i just want to kind of so jesus left and and uh i was reading various commentaries on how long he was away and i found it was really interesting that one said he he left for about a day and then he got word that jesus was that lazarus was sick so when jesus heard that he said this sickness is not of death but for the glory of god that the son of god might be glorified thereby it's not under death you know i think bad things happen and uh it's you're you can never be separated from the love of god if you're if you're if you're a real born-again christian what can separate you from the love of god death or as paul said it went through that long list of all the different things in this separate you can then separate you none of those things can separate you from the love of god if you're really born again when jesus heard that he said this sickness is not under death but for the glory of god that the son of god might be glorified thereby now jesus loved martha and her sister and lazarus when he had heard therefore that he was sick he abode two days still in the same place where he was so he he heard that he was sick and he said well i'm gonna stay another two days so he waited two more days then after that saith he to his disciples let us go into judea again his disciples saying to him master the jews of late sought to stone thee and go us thou thither again jesus answered other not 12 hours in the day if any man walk in the day he stumbleth not because he seeth a lot of this world but if a man walk in the night he stumbleth because there is no light in him these things said he and after that he saith unto them our friend lazarus sleepeth but i go that i may awake him out of sleep now so for three days lazarus was getting sicker and sicker and then he died and there he was in the ground now i'm i'm comparing this if you disagree maybe just toss the seed out but i'm kind of comparing praying this with the down through the seven church ages the church got sicker and sicker because they got they got further and further off the word until uh you know entire tire brother branham compared ahab and jezebel and ah churches stay married and they set up the pope and and they they joined together they sent that pope over them and said instead of god and the church that seed went into the ground and and it had to come forth again one day jesus answered let's see then said his disciples lord if he sleep he shall do well how be it jesus spake of his death but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest and sleep then said jesus unto them plainly lazarus is dead and i am glad for your sakes that i was not there to the intent you may believe nevertheless let us go unto him then said thomas which is called did him us unto his fellow disciples let us also go that we may die with him then when jesus came he found that he had laying in the grave four days already so he was sick for three days and then he laying in the ground for four days which makes seven days on the seventh day what was happening the the threat that little family there was waiting for jesus to come for his return so that he could raise lazarus from the dead and bring lazarus back to life and that's why you know brother branham before he he preached the the prayer lines he would preach he several times he preached that little message then jesus came and called because he was showing that that same jesus that was shown talked about in in in all of these new testament stories was there was there veiled in flesh again to heal to to make known the secrets of the heart to heal the body that he was present that he had come that he was coming then when jesus came he found that he had lain in the grave four days already now bethany was nigh unto jerusalem about 15 furlongs off and many of the jews came to martha and mary to comfort them concerning their brother then martha as soon as she heard that jesus was coming went and met him but mary says still in the house then martha said unto jesus lord if thou has been here my brother had not died but i know that even now whatsoever thou will ask god god will give it thee jesus saying under earth thy brother shall rise again mars of martha's sailor to him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day jesus said unto her i am the resurrection of the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe us thou this she saith unto mea lord i believe that thou art the christ the son of god we should come into the world and when she had so said she went away and called mary her sister secretly saying the master is cometh is come and calleth for thee now we are we are first now remember at first thessalonians chapter four there's got to come a shout a voice and a trunk to take us to the wedding supper first there's got to come a call and i believe this type that shout that call now the shout is the the bread of life that came down out of heaven that god has given us in this last day to hear the message and read it and and become one with the word uniting us with him and now look at it it's so simple that you have to partake of the word but never remember that parable of the five foolish verses of the five wise virgins right at the end when the bridegroom came then the five foolish virgins realized that they didn't hadn't been this is this is i believe the revelation that they realized that they hadn't been partaking of it maybe they'd just been sitting in church maybe they had just been around the the message around the uh the revival but hadn't actually partaken of it and they realized they needed to go out and buy and buy for their self they re they realized they needed to put a little effort into reading the bible get their own personal revelation they realized that they needed to go listen to the tapes and the books because listen now the five foolish virgins have to have a revelation too when they when the rapture goes when the rapture takes place the five foolish versions that have to know that the rapture has taken place and they have to know what is going on they have to know what what the lay of the land is and what's going on with the pope and and and that they need to stay uh stay pure and and live that you know to go through the tribulation and endure the persecution that the foolish virgin will have to endure they've got to know something is going on you you can't go through that without having some kind of a revelation and think about how what a pitiful situation is that they realize too late that they need to read for themselves that they need to study they need to spend time with in prayer for their self that they need to have their own personal revelation but they were foolish they didn't spend their time wisely they didn't redeem the time now uh that's uh because they didn't maybe maybe they heard the shout but they didn't hear the shout they didn't realize the importance of a god-sent prophet and we just have just a few more minutes let me see where i am what's that 23. thank you and when she associated she went away and called mary her sister secretly saying the master is come and calleth for thee now we've heard the call because the master is coming and calleth for thee he is come as soon as she heard that she arose quickly and came unto him now what's what's the master coming for the master would not come unless it was for you and that's what the revelation is that he's coming for you he's coming first you got to believe that that he's he's coming to get you still like with healing you believe that that god wants to hear you you believe that god wants to save you and that's what that's what compared with what's a lot a lot of ministers are preaching that there's no grace for ones that are not born under certain genealogy there's no no mercy but uh you know god's blood made a way for us to be saved and i that's why i believe you know brother brown said every every christian every real christian is an optimist because you believe that there's a way there's all things impossible in the belief a real christian is an optimist so god called as soon as she heard that she rose quickly he called by a shout he sent him he sent a messenger to to to to call us to him he came unto him and now jesus was not yet coming into town but was in that place where martha made it and i'm gonna jump down just have a few more let's jump down to around verse 41. now brother branham when he would always preach this story he talked about how jesus comes in the darkest hour in the darkest time when it looks like there's no more believers it looks like you know like elijah looked a despaired he thought elijah was living in the dark ages of the old testament when it looked like there was nobody else that believed and god showed him that yeah i got i got a few set aside that are believing and now in this age it looks like everybody's falling away and there's nobody believing but god has got a few people set aside and it's going to be such a small number that he brother brown said he'd be surprised if it was eight just like noah because how how uh how few there are that will really uh desired enough to lay aside every weight that so easily possess us that desire so much to get in to the straight narrow way to study and find find out how to take this body change and so such a small little group then it took away let's see they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid and jesus lifted up his eyes and said father i thank thee the thou has heard me now i forgot what my thought was and in the darkest time now now down through this when jesus he came up on the scene in a dark time for them it looked like all hook was gone everybody was talking about him just the way everybody's talking about the message believers because they don't understand what god is doing and and then in that dark hour that jesus came along to prove that he was still the same yesterday today and forever to prove that he was still a word now that's what everybody always got mad at jesus now because he said i my father are one and he healed people on sunday they got uh on the sabbath they got they got mad at him because of his confession now now look that's that's what people makes people mad you know we all we like to quote about how paul said i'm the chiefest of sinners but you know paul also said i'm not far behind the chiefest of the apostles and we just read in first thessalonians where paul was talking about look how i have approached you i approached you in meekness and immediately i approached you like i i've approached you in such such a way i know who i am i know what i'm here to do because paul had a confession he knew what god had sent him for now when the bride begins to get a confession of that she knows that her father she and the father are one and and these other things then that uh that the show pulls away because it just makes it you know it's like you know these this is too much this is too rich for me and um so now here comes jesus he jesus is on the scene and he's come and he speaks with a loud voice when he had this spoken he cried with a loud voice lazarus come forth and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with great grave clothes and his face was bound about with the napkins you just say unto them loose him and let him go and i have some quotes about it because now now look about how that that little parable of the level how you eat and you read and you have a personal relationship and you're taking in the word until you become the fullness the the whole bride together not just one person becomes the fullness of the goddess bodily god living in you making manifest until he takes over your being until he takes you over until uh you know brother graham said you'll be a couple birds of a change right up to the change but then the change comes and you're not a cockapoo anymore because the change comes that's why your comfortable right to change because you're gonna be a couple more times you're 100 percent completely part of god and and that's what the shout is sent for to to make to bring you to that state where you just consumed by the word of god and you become so perfectly in line that you believe that it's possible for god to change you that you believe it's possible for him to do it and then what does the bride what does the bride become what now and the way i've seen church age in the church book the word has been put aside so god says i am going against you all i will spew you out of my mouth split you out of my mouth why do i just pick people out of their mouth because they're not hot or cold because they're not the voice of god for that age and those elect with him in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the lord and be his body and be his voice and perform his works and then lay the church age further down but god said luther with the word the lutheran spoke for god at that time and uh and then they denominated he said they could no longer speak for god then god said wasteland he was the voice with the word in his day and then in this last day we will be under the under our messenger will be the final voice to the final age and i'll stop right there
