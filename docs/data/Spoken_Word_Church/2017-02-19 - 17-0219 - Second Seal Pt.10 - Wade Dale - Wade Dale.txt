========================================

miss that queue huh that's okay that's all right good to see everybody this morning everybody have a good week yes I started over here and asked a few of you have a good week Dan you have a good week better than I had last better in the head last week yeah so we have come to a point now to where we're going to wrap this steal up and go to the third seal if that's all right with you guys so let's read it one more time make a few more comments cuz we're going to actually we're going to revisit this seal in the six seal we're going to revisit this seal cuz this is the basis cuz remember something I want to bring out now may as well do it now so let's do it now can we see all right so you got one 2 3 4 5 6 seven all right you got seven CS right seven CS 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven all right if we break all that down and we know one thing for sure that brother R said the Raptor happens in 46 that right right this is the r okay so whatever it takes and you got to see this this is like the onion peel you can't just say well we got to go here and then we're going to keep continuing on cuz you have to drop back cuz there's a lap over there's a um and like brother Dale was going to talk about there's interval see there's an interval here yes there's an interval right there look in your Bible even when they they Revelation 61 gives us six seals right then it breaks to Revelation 7 which talks about the Jews coming in then Revelation 81 is the seventh seal so there's an there's a chapter interval then you got the trumpets that go through Revelations 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 Revelations 10 1-7 is injected in there and then Revelations 11 is the seventh trumpet so you got intervals then you got you got all your you got intervals between the sixth Church age and the seventh Church age right you got a gap there's a gap There's Always Somewhere you stop and PA all right so now we're in Seal number two so we showed that this one is what we're just going to say that's justification okay under the seals we see justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then brother R say what the word right cuz the word's got to be restored back the word's got to be back here in power and and you know four is not it's an Earthly number why because we get it all happens down here mhm there was four horse riders and there was four bugs in Joel but there was four that counteracted that which is justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and the word right all right which is The Headstone so The Headstone had to come back you say well what who are these two who are these three going to affect well obviously they're going to affect the Jews but remember the Jew starts all back and comes all the way back through here that horse rider goes all the way from apostasy in the in the first um three Church ages fourth Church age so this is 1 2 and three 4 5 6 and seven you got that got that M first three Church ages we showed a justification the first three Church ages 1 2 and three the word was brought in power and the lion ox man and then the eagle what the full word restore all right so there's your breakdown so truly the Rapture happens on the fourth seal and takes all the church ages out of here got it but what's 56 and 7 56 and 7 has the lap back over to here cuz who number seven MH Christ himself is the seventh seal you can't put him just coming to Israel he has to come to us to take us in Rapture right he has to come to us in this part that's why I want you to see the the types that we're showing here is something we can type down here like we're talking about upstairs with Jesus and I want yall to understand something I'm not just giving you stories of Jesus in in his life if the son of man Ministry is back here now in power then the same thing that Jesus is going through we're going to have to go through the same things that he spoke is what we're going to have to speak yeah it's not just good stories and talking about the Pharisees right right who's the Pharisees of the day the religious people of this time not back then but right now right CU those people are dead and gone we don't have to worry about Kus but we do have to worry about the spirit that anointed Kaa it's still here right it's not going to die to way back on over this way all right so we got to lap these back over so when I want you to see that's why the Rapture take place in the foreal why cuz this right here is this is all the Holy Ghost right right it's not that a lion is one Holy Ghost and the ox is another and the man's another no it's all the same character or different characteristics of one person when Jesus was here he f fulfilled all of them right I was thinking uh yesterday that you know Jesus was he was a prophet he was the prophet right what does the prophet do when he strikes the Earth he does three things he condemns the previous generation he brings a plague on the earth and then he brings his message Jesus did the same thing I'm going to talk to about this afternoon but you know where Jesus said I talked to it a little bit at the end of the sermon last week Jesus said I didn't come to bring peace and I'm going to read you another scripture where he says I come to divide right yeah yeah he come he didn't come to bring now what what is he talking about he's the Prince of Peace if we have the Prince of Peace inside of us that's why the letter kill it he was trying to tell those Pharisees that this is what the old I am what the Old Testament was all about I am the revelation of the Old Testament M yes and they turned him down so save same now and we'll read we'll read something to to show a real type about this age all right so for those of you that come in late we're talking about we're bringing the seals 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 we're we're on seal number two we're fixing get off event get on seal number three seal number one type justification seal number two sanctification three the baptism of the Holy Ghost and four is the word four is an Earthly number but four is not bad God has completed in three but then you have to bring the word in power onto that Holy Ghost to make it what the eagle anointing you got your lion first three ages Ox the fourth age which we were just talking about the third seal is the fifth and sixth Church age which is man which what you got in the fifth and six Church look at these two men now these were fine but the look Printing Press Printing the Bible uh bringing things together written word of God you bringing all this stuff the shrewdness of man with with Martin Luther and on Wesley right mhm but now watch the shrewdness of the devil has to come the same way that's right right which coming up on these justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost and then the word all right so what we were talking about we go up on the fourth seal so we Rapture on the fourth seal cuz brother R said there's no more you you don't see any more combat beef that was his analogy that and the Revelation not an analogy that was a revelation that God giv him that there's no more holy ghost on the earth as far as a gentile age there's no more Gentile holy ghost on the earth when we take a Rapture it is only to the Jews no one will be saved except the Jews the 144,000 is the only people that will receive the Holy Ghost I'm sorry 144,000 and two let's be technical there's two prophets that's going to have the Holy Ghost to preach to them so that they can get the Holy Ghost all right but they're not responsible for this type of a Rapture they're not responsible for a body change right while we're alive cuz they're all going to be killed MH so they're not responsible with our responsibility is to take these right here and we're going to get but we're going to look I want you to see the higher order that we come up into 5 six and seven with an interval that's what that is right there that's that's a little interval CU like brother Dale talking you you read your Bible you look at even brother Brown preaching six Seals having questions and answers and then preaching seven the Bible Revelation 61 comes all the way down look at the very end it's just the six seals then you got Revelation 7 which has nothing to do with the seals itself after these things right all right then you got Revelations 81 when he had opened the seventh seal there's an interval even in the Bible between even in the um uh the trumpets 1 2 2 4 5 6 then you bring Revelations 10 1 through 10 1 through whatever it is but we always go 10 1 7 but Revelations 10 you bring Revelations 10 in right here and then you bring that in and you look and see that the seventh trumpet is in the the next chapter there's an interval see the seventh seal had to become into an eight because it's still in seven but it is an eternal number because that's Jesus Christ all right yes I'll let D brother Dale explain a lot of that today and and next Sunday really some good things going to come out today y'all yall sleep this afternoon but you pay attention this morning I know you're going to do anyway so that's why I said that excellent huh I got permission yeah you got permission you don't know what I'm going to do while you're hope your mouth's not open right yeah yeah CU I get I'm going to get some in red hot from Susan it'll either choke you now what you need is those strips that you put on your tongue oh yeah I put it around a Tong they go to all right let's get back to this because we're getting into the third seal we're getting into a little more of an understanding and like I said the other day when I was speaking Sunday we all think that there's some great there is a great key but we all think that it's some some something that God's going to you know split the Eastern skies and come down and hand us a book another book or something else it's already written it's already been spoke all we have to do is is is dig out what's already there all right so we're not looking you know some people say wellow he that sermon was boring was it if it was boring to you then you need the Holy Ghost even though you may say well I don't understand all that there should have been one or two things that you get out of it listen people you're only going to get one or two things out of a sermon anyway right an hour and an hour and 15 or 20 minute sermon you might get listening that you can take and say back again 15 minutes right the rest of it is filler and background you just don't know this till your ministry it's filler and background right but you've got a 15 minute Gap that you want everybody to listen to this but it may not be 15 minutes in a row it may be 5 minutes here 5 minutes here 5 minutes here but there's something that you need to get same thing with these seals you think well this is boring we've already heard this before but something you going to have to tie together and you going to have to tie it together yourself cuz I can't tie it together for you but I'm want to try to make it more simple if the Rapture takes place on the fourth seal cuz we're going to start on the third seal we're going to read the second seal in just a few minutes and then we're going to read the third seal make a few comments and then come back next week but this is the way the setup is we've already come through justification and sanctification which this is not baby form justification this is not the justification when you got first born again okay mhm right right if you don't have that over if you don't have the Holy Ghost first you're not going to understand any of this if this is the greatest anointing that the prophet of God ever preached under quoting him then how you going to understand it without the Holy Ghost right problem is it's just like the Pharisees the Pharisees did the same thing with Ten Commandments yeah Pharisees did the same thing with Ten Commandments we got Moses's Commandments and we living by them and Jesus said they were dead why they took the letter that's why if you when when brother Brown said the rats would take place in the for seal the people were like well then 56 and 7 is not to us but we're going to prove that 56 and 7 has a lot to do with our body change yes so we have to lump it back in right here cuz this is where it all takes place if the Rapture takes place on the fourth seal then the body change has to take place underneath that for seal cuz we can't go on a Rapture without at least one person taking a body chain without death right right would you explain why the intervals are necessary what they're what they do it's a pause or a place to stop because if you'll read these seals 1 2 3 4 5 6 what does revelation 7 talk about a minute I'll show you [Music] [Music] are the seventh seal is always this is Christ right now what happens here is it brings it all to here for Gentiles cuz when we Rapture nothing but Jews will be saved after we leave here mhm so five is fifth seal Jew six is the two prophets and the seventh seal is Christ coming back to fight you'll see we're not going to read it right now but that seventh seal is what the calling out of the I'm sorry the interval is the calling out of the 144,000 what do the two prophets do call out 144,000 that's right all right then Christ comes on the earth just you you keep reading one of the elders what are these are raiding white Roes in other words he's telling you who it is then the first thing you come to Revelations 81 when you had open the seventh seal right then you're going to go into the trumpet so there was an interval there showing even Jesus when he preached he preached six seals in the Bible Matthew 24 we're getting way ahead of ourselves Matthew 24 he preaches and tells them about the six seal then what does he do he says parable of the feet tree same thing he's bringing Israel in he's showing Israel Israel has to be a part of these seals but not until we get out of here yes nothing is to Israel let hold on I'm trying not to be so because Israel as a nation will not be saved until we leave here Israelites or Jews can be saved right now under the baptism of the Holy Ghost and they can go into Rapture all right okay like that brother Solomon right what's his name no uhuh no the one that sent the message brother came Jacob Solomon Jacob see he's a message believer but he's a Jew and he's bringing Jews in now they're message Believers they're coming in here they're not going to they're not going to be here if if you if they get the Holy Ghost now cor their Nation a Jew is a still a nation but God separated them but um and I may read it no I won't read it this Sunday it shows the Jews will be scattered there scattered into all nations so why are they scattered into all nations so they become a nationality but what happened several years ago God said return back because I've got 144,000 that's got to be back here to listen to that message of two prophets be saved filled with the Holy Ghost die and then they take a Rapture right then the rest of the Danel 70 weeks can be fulfilled you got all your atomic war you've got your Jews coming back in the Millennium or in the this post Millennium or premillennium to build the temple and then we come in at the very end to anoint the temple that's way on down the road so at all times that's why brother said if you don't get the Daniel 7 weeks you're not going to understand how this works right and that's the truth you're not going to understand how this works cuz if if Danel 70 weeks ends right here then the Millennium must take place right there right right and it can't mhm they they got to build a millennium Temple the 144,000 got to come back so there's time that's what I was telling y' all the other day we look at that date 2026 and brother Dale says we can go we are going to go past 2026 yeah yeah right okay if 2026 ends Daniel 70 week then in 3026 we're going to the white Throne judgment because this is time the Millennium is time we're going to have days nights mhm months which are all going to go back to 360 but we're going to have cuz that 1,000 years is not 365 and4th it's really it's really interesting because brother R was talking about Atomic something may have blew up before the flood to make the Earth shift well this is going to be an atomic battle again and what if it sets it right back up it's going to have to because that put us back to 360 days of the year so we're we're going to live a thousand years in time right brother D's going to cover that this week and and probably next week because there's some things that's got to go on in the Millennium that we're just now getting a revelation of that is not part of the future home but yet you can mold some of them together cuz brother Brown somebody asked him said can babies be born in the Millennium he said I can see where they can I can see where they can mhm but now in the future home no right in the future in the Millennium this going to be demons that are going to be but they're going to be bound but they're still going to be there and they're going to be loosed at the Battle of go and Magog but now that future home is what it's an eight see we're we're going to be in a seven all the way till the day of the white Throne judgment right right the seventh day yes I hope y'all caught that last Sunday where brother Dale was preaching you you got six days of creation right and bobin was talking and and Louise the other night at the banquet you got six days of creation well Man was created here and then what did God say he said I'm going to rest on the seventh day now man fell right in the first part of that seventh day right right so you want to talk about an interval there's an interval between the 6 and the 7 right what's the interval that's right 6,000 years of time cuz the seven the seventh the seventh day is the Millennium God said the day you eat thereof that day you'll die so they fell in that seventh day but God had to bring time as an interval 6,000 years of time and then after that 6,000 years of time Brother D proved it just the other day we're in year 57 something we're not even at that yet but we're getting there but that's seven that's not a day like a 24-hour day that's a rest for the people yes right we got our rest here listen everything that's spoke of in the Bible I want you to realize the bride gets it here yes right other things have to happen because of this other things have to happen because of this because of the seals because of this but we get every bit of this our Eighth Day comes right here right your Soul's in the Eighth Day right now yeah mhm we just got to wait for the Redemption of the body to bring it into the eth day because in the eth day all all bodies will be glorified yes but not in a seven cuz remember somebody a heathen has got to live a thousand years of Earthly time to prove that the sin curses over now it's not me and you the bride doesn't cuz we're Eternal right here right the 140 [Music] it was built on your desire yeah right it was built by your desire read the future home brother D said read read the future home he said he makes that with the desire the bride's desire is what he builds that future home on cuz remember he types it he said why would a man not want to build something for his wife yes that she will enjoy all right right all right so everybody got that so far clear as mud kind of a lot of drawing here but but that's what I want because when we go into three and four we're not going to background much we just going to kind of keep going all right but that interval to me is is to catch everything up catch everything up get everything settled in your mind bring a group of people in and then we all go right and that means in Revelation also cuz cuz brother Dale's had this Revelation for a long time it's just taking a long time for us to catch up with it m okay so so hopefully we're we're catching up cuz if not you're either going to catch up or you're going to or you going to you're going to be you going to be here out through here you going to be here yeah all right so everybody got that so far Raptor happens on the for SE get rid of that need that anymore that's why I said we was talking the other day that's why that to me that there was no Dimension that genesis6 man was not was not formed in in a dimension that genesis6 man is an eternal man he was formed in eternity or brought forth in eternity all right so that was not in time but when man fell in the seventh day rest God said hold on you can't live a thousand years I'm going to withdraw that th years but we're going to have 6,000 years of time first three Dimensions the three dimensions that's in time is first three life like matter all right okay and that's where man fell man fell when God put him in Flesh on the earth then he put a division I'll put enmity what's enmity imity is a division we're going to read it today where Lazarus went to hell I mean sorry Lazarus went to heaven and Rich ruler went to hell he said I can't come to you and you can't come to me cuz there's a great Gul fix what there's a dimension there's a divide that you can't go across now this man right here can mhm right all power in heaven and earth been given unto me he can go travel through any Dimension he wanted to all right and he can because of that glorified body and that's the problem that we have we can't get through this because this is in time that's right this matter Life Light and matter that's matter that's that's something solid but if you come over into the dimension with Christ that means nothing mhm that's not even a a barrier amen cuz he walked through concrete cuz that's what they made their buildings out of back then and he walked right through the wall the Bible says so so that's what we're coming to people on Earth not in heaven on Earth what we're coming to but we got to get these seals and show that they were not just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 brother Brian preached them and he left and then we're just here to no we got to we got to see when we see these things coming the Bible says when you see these things approaching look up for your Redemption draw now so when we see these things coming when we see that that the Holy Ghost is not totally in power yet we don't let it be in power yet okay I I don't the Holy Ghost has never been has never been uh um where he couldn't do whatever he wanted to but the prophet of God said the Holy Ghost has been bound for 2,000 years at the door of creed and Dogman so our cre and dogmas is what binds the Holy Ghost yeah cuz remember I love what the prophet of God said this helped me more than anything brother said the Holy Ghost is a gentleman that's why he stands at the door and knocks he doesn't just if it was me or you to save our children we'd bust the door down and go in and save them right God goes it's your choice I'm not coming in unless you want me in even brother Bri preached doors and doors he said even when you get the Holy Ghost he walks into your house and yet there's a closet door closed or door closed over here that you won't let Pride he calls them Pride this he gives all different meanings of the things we don't let him in that's where this comes in amen that's where this comes in there's your doors yes there's the doors that you won't let him in right that's why that's very important after you're born again that's very important cuz brother R said a lot of people have these traits or characteristics and not even warning him but if you let him in your house and let him do his work then what's he going to do he's going to seal it with the Holy Spirit or the Holy Ghost then he's going to bring the word that's why you see here 1 2 3 lonox man and Eagle Lono man an eagle then what's going to happen The Headstone going to come and we're going to take out of here cuz who's The Headstone Christ he's the headstone he told us he was he I'll read it today he told them who he was he said you've rejected The Headstone and now I've become the corner in other word right the Chief Cornerstone so that's just an overview and I'm going to leave that up there if you want to look at it a little more but 1 2 3 4 this is this is our time but 56 and 7 has to lap back over and help us take a body change everybody understand we got to take a body change and it's got to be something that no one else has done except Jesus Christ himself why do you take a body change he was he was number seven he was the seventh seal made manifest the Seal of the tomb was broke and he says all power in heaven Earth been given unto me so Christ is the seventh seal and sure he comes to you at the Holy Ghost but it's in a baby form it's in a form just like the 3,000 downstairs on the day of Pentecost all right so these seals are not just something that we read through there's a meaning behind every one of them everybody all right with that do you do you at least say you see this whether you understand it or not just say okay I see how we go to four the r take place cuz 5 six and seven to me are are super important we're not going to be here when they actually break but they got to break to us before we take a Rapture so you got to lap them back over remember all you Church agents what they do they lap over why because there's a place right in here that remember what we were talking on on the search agents there's a porter that walks out and introduces right so what brother brand do at the end time he didn't introduce another church AIDS he didn't introduce another church AIDS Messenger right he introduced the seventh seal yes he introduced Christ right the son of man K red blood killing mhm all right so that's the same thing with you and I to me cuz see look justification does not kill the unclean Spirit I'm let's go back to baby form justification baby form justification only chops off your past sin all right you continue the person that made you do that is still there now this afternoon we're going to read where Jesus is talking about the unclean spirit what goes out right a word to clean you up the unclean Spirit goes out of a man Seth rest walk in dry places seek rest find us none comes back and if you don't put something in there like the the analysis of the of the cup you find this cup it's all dirty you can clean it up you can put it in the dishwasher but if you set it right back out into the yard where you found it it's going to get dirty again cuz it's not sealed mhm right but if you'll fill it up with something and then seal it the Holy Ghost if you'll put something in seal it it won't get dirty on the inside now the outside can get dirty that's this guy yeah that's where you got to work on this but inside it's clean so there was a second seal hang on let's read it around here power was given unto him to take peace from the earth that they should kill one another and there was given to him a great sword now what what was that great sword we said the great sword that Satan was given was one word off go back to the Garden the reason we had to be put in time was one word not one word got us out of the garden that's why brother Brown said one word off not going to get us back in the garden okay so but we have a word if you'll take the right word it'll clean you up if not it's going to cut it's going to kill you that's why I said sanctification is one of the worst places to stay in it's not not a bad place to be it's one of the worst places to stay that way cuz the Pharisees that's where they were we're clean we're holy we do what the we do what the the Torah says we do what Moses Abraham's Our Father remember he they kept telling Jesus Abraham's Our Father we do what Moses said who are you you're in here and you're tearing everything up but he said if You' have known Abraham you'd have known me if you have known Moses You' have known me so what did they know Moses and Abraham by letter right do this don't do that do this don't do that yes brother brandham said cuz all you major doctrines in the message they going to go back to brother brand said true that's why I've always said they stood up and they said we have Moses's quotebook and they did everything Moses quoted the Torah was everything Moses wrote first five books of the Bible that's what they based everything on right yes all right same way with the message you pick pick a message book up and say we're saying what the prophet said are you are you they never understood Jesus he and I'll read it this afternoon they didn't understand Jesus so they never understood the other prophets and he said you killed them the own religious World killed the prophets in the Old Testament Isaiah was a young boy but he they saw him up in pieces yeah because of what he believed because of what they said he was a lunatic or a heretic or whatever Isaiah was was one of the greatest prophets ever lived really didn't look what they did to John the Baptist they took John the Baptist and cut his head off so and Jesus told him he said you know they said can you drink of this cup and they said we can he said yes you can said but this is what you're going to go through they're going to take you before Kings they're going to kill you we'll read that this afternoon so that's what exactly what's going to happen in this age if we have the son of man Ministry back here then I'm not just telling y'all stories up there Sunday afternoon you got to bring it to here right right you got to bring it to here right you got to see well aha I know why that happens because of and you got to look back and see what happened in the Pharisees because Jesus Jesus told us everything we needed to know yes if not he's got to come back and tell us something different you hear what I said different but he's not he preached the seals already told us what was going to happen told us the Gent I mean the Jews were coming in the Fig Tree is always the Jews the Fig Tree The Olive Tree and all these things coming in then the Wild Olive Branch is going to be put in which is us all right that space of time in there so these seals are are truly the most important part of this message but if you don't get all the other Foundation it's just going to be you know you're looking for something to happen after the second seal you go well what's going to happen you got to make it happen I can't make it happen I know what I'm looking at you got to know what you're looking at like brother Dale he's he's it sounds smart out it to people but he's the only one that knows he's right we may have a problem or question about whether he's right or not but you better know that you're right somebody better know that they're right I would rather have that and somebody going up there and preach 40 years and go I don't know if this is right or not but we're going to preach this today come on baby but you got to know if you're right or not you'll know if he's right if you're right right let me say that again you'll know if he's right if you're right you'll know if I'm right if you're right right I uh I heard something the other day and it was really profound and I'll tell you this and we ain't getting no where we start next Sunday like we always do a guy said he was talking about looking for a partner looking for a mate he said how you going to find the Perfect Mate how do you find the Perfect Mate how's the the perfect way to find a Perfect Mate you make yourself one first that's it that's true you make yourself a perfect mate and then whatever ever is out there will come drawn to that and I thought that is so profound and he's not even in the message that's awesome but that's profound same thing with God same thing with with your Christian walk if you want Christ to live in your life if you want Christ to reveal these things to you act like him that's act like him cuz he's your partner right he's your mate yeah if you going to looking for a mate be the be the Perfect Mate to start with you be the Perfect Mate and then whatever's out there I'll come to you same thing with the Revelation that's I talking about that I was reading and I thought man that is so profound that if we cuz brother R said we become the word as we what eat the word as we take the word in to make yourself available for the word if you don't make yourself available then he he's like I said holy ghost is a gentleman if you don't want to study okay don't but you're
