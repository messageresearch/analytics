[3:13] First Corinthians 11 verse 18 and 19.
[3:19] and first of all when you come together
[3:21] in the church I hear that there'll be
[3:23] divisions among you and I partly believe
[3:25] it
[3:26] for there must need must excuse me now
[3:28] for there must be heresies among you
[3:32] and it must be this guy comes right amen
[3:34] one God allows it to come to do what to
[3:39] test you and I you say well why would he
[3:42] let this happen why not to test you and
[3:44] I to see whether or not we're going to
[3:45] stay with a word amen all right so if
[3:48] then for there must be heresies among
[3:50] you that they which are approved may be
[3:53] made manifest among you all right we'll
[3:56] see who will stay with the word right
[3:58] amen and we'll go to First Peter 3.
[4:03] 15
[4:05] let's sanctify the Lord in your hearts
[4:07] and be ready always to give an answer to
[4:09] every man that asks you a reason of the
[4:12] hope that is in you with meekness and
[4:15] fear you may be seated the Lord had his
[4:18] Blessing to the reading of the word
[4:23] yeah
[4:26] we have started kind of a little series
[4:28] or part on talking about some of the
[4:31] doctrines among the people of the
[4:33] message
[4:34] and I am in no way trying to straighten
[4:37] out anybody I'm just trying to preach to
[4:40] you and the things that I see and and I
[4:44] put this trying to on each one that I
[4:47] know and realize that there are so many
[4:50] different versions
[4:51] that people have over doctrinal issues
[4:56] and I don't know every version but I'm
[4:59] saying that because there are a lot of
[5:01] people that have a lot of different
[5:02] versions and they as they do that they
[5:05] you know they don't wholly follow say
[5:08] one person with it they'll be different
[5:11] Sprout auction runoffs and things like
[5:13] that and to any of them that here then
[5:16] you just remember that I'm saying that
[5:18] according to what I've heard myself do I
[5:23] speak these things and then trying to
[5:25] show why I agree with it or do not agree
[5:28] with it you know it's that point but I
[5:31] want you to get that in your mind that
[5:33] you know
[5:34] it's not just one thing see and that's
[5:37] why I don't want to call names
[5:39] because that would put it in there's no
[5:42] need of it
[5:44] so you that would hear this you just
[5:46] remember it's your responsibility for
[5:49] your soul to be able to uh search out
[5:52] what's being preached to you or what
[5:54] you've heard or whatever that's up to
[5:56] you it's not up to me because I'm not in
[5:58] no way am I a pastor of anything other
[6:01] than the lunar congregation these are on
[6:05] internet that are with us and things uh
[6:08] this morning
[6:09] um you know that's your choice and and
[6:13] that way I'm not trying to straighten
[6:15] out anything other than preach here what
[6:18] I believe and the things that we stand
[6:20] for and we have you know new ones Among
[6:23] Us and things that we have just started
[6:26] covering some doctrines and if there's
[6:28] anything that you think of uh as we're
[6:31] going along we're going to be another
[6:32] few weeks about this and then Wade is
[6:35] going to be on uh marriage enrichment
[6:38] something like that family life me and
[6:41] so you know you don't have time to write
[6:43] them down and we can kind of ponder over
[6:45] them but if you know if you think of
[6:47] something and say well I heard a brother
[6:48] so and so what do you believe about this
[6:50] write it then I'll answer the best I can
[6:52] not to try to anybody we're out there
[6:54] you know there's another amount of
[6:55] business what anybody believes and I've
[6:57] always said if you can believe your big
[6:59] toe is God if you want to just don't
[7:01] expect me to worship it you know I'm
[7:03] just sorry that just me you know and
[7:06] I've always been blunt I think anybody's
[7:08] reading I read that to be able to give a
[7:10] reason and Hope
[7:12] that lies within you you know and the
[7:15] reason that I believe what I believe and
[7:17] if I cross a doctrinal issue you know of
[7:21] something that you don't agree with but
[7:23] just remember I I didn't know who all
[7:26] would be here today to sit here and if
[7:29] whatever would be listening on tape I'm
[7:31] not that don't have that much
[7:33] discernment so I just rang a topic bring
[7:35] a topic bring a topic and just cover
[7:37] that and we went through
[7:40] um last Sunday afternoon we covered the
[7:43] doctrine of the was called the two Soul
[7:45] doctrine that went for many many many
[7:48] years 40 years ago I guess close to it
[7:52] and came on down through this past
[7:54] Wednesday we did get to cover a couple
[7:57] of doctrines and we covered the doctrine
[7:59] of what is called the two Lords
[8:02] you know we covered that part and then
[8:04] we got into what most people would call
[8:06] the River Jordan doctrinal Point are
[8:09] those that believe that Jesus wasn't God
[8:12] until the River Jordan you know and you
[8:16] know so we covered those in trying to
[8:20] this state what we believe that's why we
[8:24] believed it and that's that's all right
[8:26] as I say whatever you believe that's
[8:28] between you and your God right it is not
[8:31] up to me I'm just trying to express what
[8:34] I believe all right now
[8:37] so what we're going to do today is to
[8:39] take one that was called and I told you
[8:42] now there's different versions so you
[8:44] know I'm just trying to stay with what I
[8:46] know from what I've heard myself
[8:49] if it's something of a Doctrine you ask
[8:51] me something I'll say well I haven't
[8:52] heard that one I'll be glad to tell you
[8:54] that but the things that I've heard and
[8:56] listened to and and some of these
[8:58] doctrines I have listened to
[9:02] um you know on this one on the the
[9:06] the seven tone diversary doctor and I
[9:08] listened to probably 10 or 11 tapes
[9:10] right in a row trying to understand what
[9:13] the person was saying because I want to
[9:15] do that I don't want to argue the point
[9:17] it's not to argue this message is not to
[9:19] be argued it is to be lived in our
[9:22] hearts and lives to bring Jesus Christ
[9:24] forth you know and all like that and uh
[9:27] but this there was a message started
[9:29] back years ago started back in the uh
[9:32] late 60s early 70s
[9:35] that was called more or less than seven
[9:38] Thunder virtue Doctrine
[9:40] all right
[9:41] now as I said there's many versions of
[9:43] that now so just get what I'm talking
[9:45] about
[9:46] and then don't call me and say well
[9:48] you're talking about no no I'm talking
[9:50] about what I understand what I heard
[9:53] myself as to be uh this we were
[9:56] happening to be in brother calling us
[9:58] was in making many years ago when the
[10:01] brother began to talk about the uh the
[10:04] doctrine of the seven Thunder virtues
[10:06] and back at that time they had the uh uh
[10:09] talking about how Henry Aaron knocked
[10:12] the Home Run and and brought everybody
[10:14] in and all these others at loaded the
[10:16] bases up and and then the the uh a
[10:20] chiropractor doctor he preached that you
[10:23] had seven
[10:25] um
[10:26] what you call them in your neck it was
[10:29] many different thoughts about it that
[10:31] was brought out but the basic thought
[10:33] that as far as I could fall and
[10:35] understand words that they were saying
[10:38] that the the Thunders were the virtues
[10:41] of second Peter
[10:43] you know Faith virtual knowledge tempers
[10:45] patience not in this brotherly kindness
[10:47] and Etc and then turning out to be loved
[10:50] and uh you know they said there was was
[10:54] seven this that was the seven thunders
[10:56] in other words that Thunder number one
[10:58] now I'm telling you this now because see
[11:00] there's different versions so get that
[11:02] but the basics of what I heard and
[11:04] understood to be saying that like
[11:06] thunder number one was virtue number one
[11:07] number two with virtue number two and
[11:10] that was why it was called the seventh
[11:12] under virtue virtue whatever how you
[11:15] pronounce it uh doctrine that was uh you
[11:20] know brought in and uh you know there
[11:23] were some things that I try to bring out
[11:26] even something natural all right to
[11:28] where you can look at something and say
[11:29] well well you know uh
[11:32] this
[11:34] some people can't count
[11:36] and they don't read right you know and
[11:40] and I'd like for you if you would to go
[11:41] over of course you'll put it up on the
[11:43] thing uh go ahead brother pull up second
[11:46] Peter
[11:48] and I want you to look real close
[11:51] because that's why I said for me to just
[11:54] get up here and say well what do you
[11:55] believe by yourself I don't believe it
[11:58] well there was a lot in there I didn't
[11:59] really
[12:00] and you know a lot of the things that
[12:02] you do believe about this and that's not
[12:05] an answer to a question right that's
[12:07] diverting from the fact that you have an
[12:09] answer yourself
[12:10] you know I heard it's about a meeting
[12:12] they had one time and they called a
[12:14] certain brother and he was supposed to
[12:15] sit down you know and and uh you know he
[12:18] just got up and he said I agree with
[12:20] that brother well everybody said that
[12:22] brother's right well nobody hadn't heard
[12:24] it what their brother even believed you
[12:26] know and nobody didn't know it just that
[12:28] man's word you know and I don't think
[12:30] that works
[12:32] but now
[12:33] get what I'm saying that of my
[12:35] understanding of what they were saying
[12:37] was the seven Thunders
[12:39] were the seven virtues
[12:42] of second Peter
[12:44] now
[12:45] I want to ask you a simple question
[12:50] if you look at second Peter then
[12:53] you will see
[12:54] wait a minute they got to say up here
[12:56] too bring it down to one yeah
[12:59] back up the chapter brother
[13:02] I may have wrote that down on the thing
[13:04] but I'm sorry but I just carried that in
[13:06] there a moment ago and tell them to
[13:07] bring it up they'll they'll get if you
[13:09] don't look in your Bible you can you can
[13:11] get it and and uh they'll pull it up in
[13:13] just a second does it real good at that
[13:15] I probably wrote it down on the wrong
[13:16] thing so a contract proper opinion I'm
[13:19] not always perfect you know I make a lot
[13:22] of goof UPS you know I don't mind
[13:24] admitting I give up but you know but the
[13:27] Lord will take care of it okay now if
[13:30] you're looking in second Peter though
[13:31] the point I want you to get
[13:33] is
[13:36] if you're gonna have
[13:38] Seven Virtues
[13:41] all right
[13:44] and then where are you going to start
[13:51] with faith
[13:53] you're looking in your Bible you will
[13:55] see that if you said well okay we'll
[13:58] start with second Peter because it says
[13:59] there if I add to your faith furniture
[14:01] all right
[14:03] then you would have Fae
[14:06] virtue knowledge Temperance patient
[14:08] godliness brotherly kindness
[14:11] and charity
[14:14] and something went wrong there because
[14:17] mathematically you've missed it
[14:20] that's eight
[14:23] right amen
[14:26] now we can all see it back here if you
[14:30] count it Faith see one two three four
[14:34] five six seven eight
[14:38] so how where are you going to start
[14:41] see and people don't listen to that they
[14:44] just come up with a Doctrine virtue
[14:46] number one would be faith
[14:49] you know to what the doctrine was
[14:51] virtue number two would be
[14:54] Thunder number two you know
[14:56] well then you would have seven Thunders
[14:58] and you don't have the headstone
[15:01] see if you make this if you see what I'm
[15:03] talking about if you start off Faith you
[15:05] so Faith number one is virtue number one
[15:08] because that was the group of people of
[15:10] Paul's day because the reason I know
[15:12] they emphasize real heavily that they
[15:16] were uh thousands and I'll give you the
[15:18] quote in a minute thousands of Little
[15:20] Voices
[15:22] thundering out brother Brown says
[15:25] but a word in other words for the age
[15:27] and time
[15:29] all right and see then that's what I'm
[15:31] saying you look at things and you say
[15:33] well brother you're just too technical
[15:35] well I have to be technical
[15:39] if I'm going to line up things in the
[15:41] right order amen right Joy as you're
[15:44] looking at it see if faith is a virtue
[15:47] then you would have faith versus
[15:48] knowledge temperamentation you'd have
[15:50] eight
[15:52] okay
[15:54] and that would make you mathematically
[15:56] missing it
[15:58] all right
[15:59] and brother Reynolds said on a message I
[16:02] didn't give you this one so but I'll
[16:04] give you where it says it's paragraph
[16:05] 217 God's only provided a place of
[16:07] worship
[16:08] uh 65 11 I guess it's 1109 or 29 but
[16:15] run around said there's seven ads
[16:19] all right
[16:21] so if you add virtue knowledge
[16:23] temperatures
[16:25] you'd have eight ads
[16:29] that you're mathematically missing it
[16:33] I mean that's just point number one
[16:35] say people don't pay close enough
[16:38] attention to what the Bible says
[16:41] they just take what somebody says and
[16:43] they say well that sounds good and you
[16:45] just lump it out and that's what a lot
[16:46] of preachers do instead of looking at
[16:49] the thing you know from the the point of
[16:52] seeing the pyramid seeing looking at it
[16:54] see if you made Faith number one
[16:57] to try to make sure that you would get
[16:58] Paul and his group of people into the
[17:01] Little Voices
[17:03] then you're going to wind up and have no
[17:05] headstones for the church
[17:08] and run around says there's seven halves
[17:13] all right
[17:14] so do you you know what I've taught you
[17:16] and what we believe
[17:18] I don't believe faith is a virtue right
[17:23] faith is a birth right amen that's right
[17:26] man right it's not a virtue it's a birth
[17:30] itself
[17:31] it's Christ birth in you all right amen
[17:34] your birth by faith you're saved by
[17:36] faith everything you get from God you
[17:39] comes by faith amen all right
[17:41] so now if you take and make not vert not
[17:44] Faith they virtue
[17:46] see then you can add and you'll be right
[17:49] so then you have seven ads see virtue
[17:52] number one would be
[17:54] thank you
[17:55] I got two three four five six seven
[17:59] right
[18:01] you're coming out right you would have
[18:03] seven eyes
[18:05] but see mathematically
[18:07] you would miss it because you're dealing
[18:09] with the wrong thing
[18:11] faith is not a virtue
[18:13] right faith is at Birth
[18:16] that's right
[18:17] the virtues are like uh characteristics
[18:22] right
[18:24] um
[18:24] whatever you would bring a baby when
[18:27] it's born is born again at Faith right
[18:30] in the body of Christ the new birth all
[18:33] right and the baby has ever part not
[18:35] much something goes wrong
[18:37] unless something goes wrong the baby has
[18:40] every part when it's born a normal baby
[18:42] has everything you know fingers toenails
[18:45] fingernails higher you know the only
[18:48] thing you don't have his teeth we're
[18:50] glad of that but they're back up in
[18:51] there right that's right they just think
[18:53] push down all right let's see then
[18:57] you take then you've got seven abs
[19:01] so you got seven virtues
[19:04] which you would start not with faith
[19:06] right that's virtue number one you would
[19:09] start with virtue amen
[19:11] see one two three four five six seven
[19:15] are you mathematically correct
[19:19] that you're dealing with it in a total
[19:21] different realm because see their point
[19:24] was and I'll get to that as I said in a
[19:25] moment the point was that that there
[19:28] were thousands of Little Voices
[19:31] thundering out and I agree with that
[19:35] amen because down through the church
[19:38] ages
[19:39] the people were thundering out the voice
[19:41] of God
[19:44] that's exactly right man they were the
[19:47] voice of God that's how he was
[19:49] thundering out that was what he was
[19:51] doing was to those people
[19:54] but yet that wasn't the seven Thunders
[19:57] amen because the seven Thunders was not
[20:01] brought about until the prophet of God
[20:03] came into view and began to talk about
[20:05] the seals amen right and the things and
[20:11] as he began to talk about it see then he
[20:14] would bring out what a thunder is
[20:20] and that away then he would come up and
[20:22] he'd say those seven Thunders were the
[20:25] revealed in the seals right amen all
[20:28] right you see the basic doctrine that
[20:31] they were using as I'll get to it in a
[20:33] second read it is that the thousands of
[20:36] Little Voices was a 1960 quote
[20:40] yeah right I'm 63 where the seals were
[20:43] broke that's right the prophet didn't
[20:45] know what those Thunders were
[20:47] nope he's like all of us he thought he
[20:49] did all right
[20:50] but he didn't know
[20:53] you agree he didn't know what the seals
[20:55] were that's right amen and we'll show in
[20:57] just a moment what it is the center is
[20:59] the voice of God the prophet said when
[21:00] the seal breaks that's right
[21:03] now there's a connection to the virtues
[21:05] it will get to the lights of the message
[21:06] and bring it back right
[21:08] but that's the connection is because
[21:10] then we can see where it goes
[21:14] but you see you know you can go into
[21:17] debatable and arguments about the people
[21:19] that brought those doctrines how that
[21:22] really they were saying you don't know
[21:23] what it is until I tell you what it is
[21:25] that's right that's it you know and I'll
[21:27] tell you when you got virtue number one
[21:29] yeah number two because I'm 30 days okay
[21:32] and I have a problem with it because we
[21:36] used to uh my wife and I would be
[21:37] listening and he'd say uh
[21:40] you know brother so-and-so when you
[21:42] first got engaged
[21:49] real dick you remember when you and Gail
[21:51] got engaged
[21:53] long time ago
[21:56] then he'd say uh and brother you
[21:58] remember when you
[22:00] got married
[22:04] um
[22:08] yeah you remember when you consummated
[22:10] your wedding and your you become forth
[22:12] with a family and the different things
[22:17] I admit I said there for type after type
[22:19] wondering why in the world is this man
[22:21] talking about because everybody just
[22:23] Rejoice you know and he was constantly
[22:25] not torn off on it I started my business
[22:27] I'm just getting a point across right
[22:28] and I you know what he constantly said
[22:31] you can be seated and why should one man
[22:35] there must be a lot of people coming in
[22:36] you know we'll come find out everybody
[22:38] jump up when he broke those points you
[22:40] know and I didn't know that and I had to
[22:42] I went back and I asked him I said watch
[22:45] this a holding system I said I happen to
[22:47] know that he's got to be making some
[22:49] form of a coated uh kovich you know how
[22:52] do you uh c-o-d-e code you know coded
[22:56] yeah not a code coded you know but it
[23:00] was some kind of a thing that he was
[23:02] saying something that everybody there
[23:04] understood but those outside of there
[23:06] didn't understand all right we'll come
[23:08] to find out what it was but see brother
[23:10] dick you remember when you're first in
[23:11] yeah in other words when you first heard
[23:12] my Doctrine
[23:16] he said but now you remember when you
[23:18] got
[23:18] really into the doctrine with me
[23:21] and you become married for my daughter
[23:25] was he then you become
[23:28] a family with us
[23:31] oh okay now I don't know what the man's
[23:34] talking about you know
[23:35] yeah but my point is just to say in that
[23:37] in case somebody hears those points you
[23:38] know because I did listen and I listened
[23:40] and I don't I do not listen now folks
[23:42] I'm honest my wife will tell you or
[23:45] anybody's everywhere I've told you over
[23:46] and over again you could you come tell
[23:48] me brother so I throw it off the message
[23:51] brother the other day gave me something
[23:52] to tell me to to look at you know and
[23:54] I've got one thing underlined to go back
[23:56] to him to show him that maybe I don't
[23:59] know what this man's talking about right
[24:00] here but other than that I read it with
[24:03] the best understanding I could read it
[24:04] not to try to find something
[24:07] I want to know what the man's talking
[24:09] about right
[24:11] because he may be talking about more
[24:13] truth than you think right
[24:16] you know all right and I killed the
[24:18] benefit of the doubt but like I said now
[24:20] they started out with the doctrinal
[24:22] issue of the virtues being the Thunders
[24:26] all right
[24:28] now
[24:30] we don't believe that the Thunder
[24:32] sounded Until the End Time correct amen
[24:34] we'll get to it in a minute about the
[24:36] seals all right now
[24:39] brother Brown said
[24:42] let the disciples the apostles you know
[24:46] they had these virtues right
[24:50] well did they did they know what the
[24:52] Thunders were
[24:53] right did Peter and them know what the
[24:56] daughters were right amen
[24:59] no no because that was the end time
[25:02] see so it was something trying to make a
[25:05] made a pretty picture but when you
[25:07] analyze the picture the cow is up in the
[25:10] tree
[25:14] she may be eating green leaves but she
[25:18] ain't on the ground where she's supposed
[25:20] to be you know she's supposed to be in
[25:23] the right place all right now say that
[25:26] not making no lie to nobody but just say
[25:29] that to to get me and you click a little
[25:32] bit okay you'll remember that quicker
[25:34] than you will anything else I see it
[25:36] then I found that out a long time ago
[25:38] I'd listened to a man he said you know
[25:41] you click something on people and he
[25:42] said they'll remember it so I'll tell a
[25:44] little dirty I mean not dirty but a
[25:46] little comic or something to go with
[25:48] what I'm saying in a thought and you'll
[25:50] remember it a whole lot if I said
[25:52] something dirty
[25:56] so I found out a long time about
[25:58] speaking you notice that you always
[26:01] remember right
[26:02] the comical part
[26:04] yeah she is you do that in school
[26:07] and that's where if you listen in school
[26:10] I always make my grades in school by
[26:12] listening
[26:13] because if you listen you can make it do
[26:16] click back to you it might take a while
[26:18] all right but now let's get into the
[26:20] point see I do not believe that the
[26:22] Seven Virtues
[26:24] would be the seven Thunders because you
[26:27] would be putting it in the wrong
[26:29] category the Thunder it will prove in a
[26:31] minute is the voice of God when the seal
[26:33] breaks now I will give you the end of
[26:36] the message to where you can now I
[26:38] believe that and can proved by The
[26:40] Prophet's message that it's these these
[26:43] Thunders as they sounded to bring us the
[26:45] voice of God to understand the seals is
[26:48] actually what will bring the virtues
[26:49] into being
[26:50] I do believe that I'll put that right up
[26:53] front so if anybody's listening I
[26:54] believe that you said well that was what
[26:56] he's talking about well that's all right
[26:57] but I didn't get that
[27:00] and I don't think anybody else got that
[27:02] the guy that the virtues with the
[27:04] Thunders and when the brother would tell
[27:06] you you got brother colleague now you
[27:08] have Mercer number three well then you
[27:10] Gloria Hallelujah number three why I
[27:12] called you said I was
[27:14] um well
[27:16] um
[27:17] brother Colleen brother Doherty can
[27:19] remember that there was
[27:22] five of us prayed for in a meeting to
[27:24] receive the baptism in the Holy Ghost
[27:26] years ago
[27:27] all right and the pastor I mean the
[27:29] preacher that prayed for us said I
[27:31] believe every one of you got it
[27:33] well you know just because he said that
[27:35] I didn't believe I had it right
[27:37] I'm honest God I know I didn't have it
[27:39] right wait with a couple of Brothers
[27:41] said they told me now that they believed
[27:45] that they got it because that brother
[27:47] said to God
[27:49] well it was five of us
[27:52] there's three of us here
[27:55] and brother calling brother already
[27:56] didn't say that and I didn't either the
[27:58] two brothers that are gone said that
[28:02] yeah you know they left went back into
[28:03] the world all right you can't base your
[28:05] salvation upon what somebody said you
[28:08] got to make sure salvation and
[28:10] experience of God in your heart all
[28:12] right amen until then for somebody to
[28:14] just tell me say Glory Hallelujah we got
[28:16] the virtues called we know what the
[28:18] Thunders are that doesn't mean that
[28:19] that's right right amen it's when God
[28:21] gives them to you amen and I prove to
[28:23] you for many many years that the only
[28:26] way the virtuers can come into the body
[28:27] of Christ
[28:29] is for the word to be preached Amen to
[28:31] the body of Christ and it be revealed
[28:33] that's right that can bring to virtues
[28:35] right it's because you say you're in the
[28:37] message it doesn't make you virtue
[28:38] number one you know a lot of people
[28:39] believe that that we're born right here
[28:42] because or at least into here because
[28:46] this is the age where we're born to him
[28:51] Lord hallelujah it's an age but that
[28:53] doesn't mean I've got everybody
[28:56] I'm sealed in and ready to go because
[28:59] I'm born in this age
[29:01] so is everybody else born in this area
[29:03] are they ready to go no but let's get to
[29:06] it amen
[29:07] so let's establish I tell you I'm
[29:09] establishing the point of what I don't
[29:10] believe I don't believe the the Thunders
[29:13] are the virtues
[29:14] right I believe you can actually have
[29:16] the virtues and not know a lot about
[29:19] what the Thunders are amen yes sir
[29:21] because the disciples had the virtues
[29:27] you know technically they were not
[29:29] disciples they were apostles
[29:30] but that's
[29:32] Disciples of follower Apostles one who
[29:34] has the New Birth all right now but
[29:37] let's get down to think on something so
[29:38] bring up number one brother on the thing
[29:41] let's go into the first seal and what I
[29:44] want to do is establish one thing what
[29:46] is the
[29:47] what is your thunder
[29:52] no
[29:53] what is a thunder
[29:57] it's Thunders are mentioned in the bible
[29:59] other than in Revelation that's right
[30:03] it's mentioned over in the Psalms
[30:06] yeah you know
[30:09] the the Lord thundered
[30:12] he turned it from Mount Sinai
[30:14] amen amen right because we're going to
[30:17] get to that in a minute you know to show
[30:19] you that right around says the Thunder
[30:20] is the voice of God Amen
[30:23] that's right so that's what happened at
[30:24] Mount Sinai was the voice of God
[30:26] thundered but the people didn't have
[30:29] enough of God in them to know what was
[30:30] said Moses knew what was said right
[30:34] but they didn't understand it because
[30:36] they just heard it thunder all right all
[30:38] right we'll get to Matthew I mean to
[30:40] John in a moment where that that Jesus
[30:43] was standing there and he said glorify
[30:44] me with the glory I had with thee before
[30:46] the world he said and it thundered right
[30:49] that's what everybody thought
[30:51] well that wasn't it that was the voice
[30:52] of God telling him what he was right
[30:54] amen
[30:56] so what do you know all about the
[30:58] technical point of the Thunders and not
[31:00] even have anything related to it amen
[31:02] all right so let's get down what the
[31:04] prophet is really saying now
[31:06] all right when that lamb broke that
[31:08] first seal a thunder brought out that's
[31:10] Revelation 6 1.
[31:13] all right
[31:15] when the lamb broke that first seal of
[31:17] Thunder roared out
[31:18] that's Revelation 6 1. all right
[31:22] now there's not another Thunder listed
[31:25] any further amen right there's one
[31:28] thunder right
[31:30] the Seal's broke right all right I wrote
[31:33] around and said now what about when they
[31:34] break in reality
[31:41] that's right
[31:42] a clap of Thunder yep
[31:44] so there was a thunder in the Bible when
[31:46] the seal broke there was Thunder when
[31:47] God revealed it to the problem all right
[31:49] now
[31:50] so what now that's got a significance
[31:53] it's not a meaning it's a meaning
[31:55] nothing happens without a meaning or out
[31:58] of Thunder a thunder roared wonder what
[32:00] that Thunder was
[32:02] all right now to save time to you to
[32:05] read in between there they can keep
[32:07] rolling that up and let you look at it
[32:09] but he's covering what I said in John
[32:12] 12.
[32:14] and he comes down to the point of John
[32:17] 12 29 when it says you know glorify me
[32:22] with the glory I had with thee before
[32:23] the foundation where they said and the
[32:25] people that stood by heard it thunder
[32:29] see they thought it thundered
[32:33] so that's all they heard right
[32:36] yep like I said the people all they
[32:39] heard at Mount Sinai was a rolling
[32:42] thunder right right
[32:46] I think it says something in the song
[32:47] that the Lord goes up or something with
[32:49] thunder and there's a seven Thunders
[32:50] it's mentioned in song I didn't I'm not
[32:53] arguing the point I'm just trying to
[32:54] show you the thought all right now look
[32:58] what he gets on over to paragraph 146
[33:00] and says when to thunder remember a loud
[33:02] clapping noise of Thunder is the voice
[33:04] of God
[33:06] and that's what happened to sunny out
[33:07] right
[33:08] that's what happened with Jesus
[33:11] a loud clapping Thunder that they
[33:12] thought it thundered
[33:14] but Jesus knew what it said right
[33:17] he went brother Brandon was on the Ohio
[33:19] River and it come down see everybody
[33:22] didn't hear that voice
[33:25] roaring out you know
[33:32] it wasn't everybody standing on side of
[33:34] the river heard the voice of heard
[33:36] thunder
[33:39] if you're not interested the place is
[33:41] supposed to be then you're just here in
[33:43] a rumble right you're not hearing the
[33:45] voice of God Amen all right
[33:48] remember a loud clapping noise of a
[33:50] thunder is the voice of God that's what
[33:51] the Bible said see clap of thunder and
[33:53] they thought it was a thunder but it was
[33:55] God he understood if or it was revealed
[33:57] to him it was a thunder and notice the
[34:00] first seal opened the first seal opened
[34:01] when it was open and assembled form it
[34:04] thundered symbol form was
[34:06] back there with John on patlas all right
[34:08] now what about when it's open in its
[34:11] reality form
[34:20] what did it do what did it reveal not
[34:23] all of it said first it was God next
[34:25] it's an assembled then it's revealed
[34:27] three things see it's it's coming forth
[34:30] from the throne first it can't be seen
[34:32] heard or nothing it's sealed up the
[34:34] Lamb's blood paid the price it thundered
[34:37] when he spoke it out and when he did a
[34:39] lot more writer started out and it still
[34:42] was a symbol
[34:44] she saw the Thunder when it sounded
[34:46] the white horse rider wrote out and it
[34:48] was a symbol so nobody didn't know what
[34:50] that was
[34:51] right it's a symbol right but see it
[34:55] thundered when that happened all right
[34:57] now
[34:59] let's go on over
[35:06] here let's pick it on that we'll just go
[35:07] on now
[35:11] did it always to be revealed at the last
[35:13] days when this actual seal is broken
[35:15] broken to who not to Christ but to the
[35:18] church notice that oh my that just makes
[35:21] me tremble I I hope that the church
[35:24] truly understands it see what I mean you
[35:27] people I'm going to call you bride see
[35:29] that you'll understand now that's the
[35:31] first time he technically ever said when
[35:33] he started off calling his bride because
[35:35] he would just link us in with the church
[35:37] but when you come up there in the fields
[35:39] he's gonna call you bride now not that
[35:41] he didn't speak of a bride before then
[35:43] but he he hung up and he related to us
[35:46] as well all right now watch what he said
[35:49] paragraph 152 first few the voice of the
[35:52] Thunder The Voice came from work
[35:55] from the throne where the lamb had just
[35:58] left his intercessor now he's standing
[36:00] here to take his position in his Planes
[36:02] but the thunder came from the inside of
[36:04] the throne to under it out and the lamb
[36:07] was standing out here the Thunder where
[36:10] the lamb had left left the Father Strong
[36:12] to go take his own Throne Glory now now
[36:15] don't miss it French all right
[36:19] I go off to it
[36:21] paragraph 262.
[36:24] let's read that one
[36:29] now let's find the symbols
[36:32] you read all in between there and get
[36:34] all the way he's talking about
[36:35] we found out what the thunder means
[36:39] now he's covered that it was a voice to
[36:41] Jesus it was the voice there it's under
[36:43] the tiny eye he covered all of those
[36:45] things now he says what that's perfectly
[36:47] we know that the Thunder was the voice
[36:49] of God when the seal opened
[36:52] all right
[36:55] now there was a thunder when the seals
[36:57] broke in the scriptures to John there
[36:59] was a thunder when they broke to the
[37:00] prophet but then he did not know what
[37:03] those seals were
[37:04] when he was in Tucson Arizona you need
[37:06] those quotes
[37:08] when he came back on the first seal he
[37:10] said I don't know what it is when he's
[37:12] preaching on the the uh
[37:15] God is Simplicity and then the bridge he
[37:17] said I don't know what the first deal is
[37:18] right right first heal he said I don't
[37:20] know what the second one is now if you
[37:22] want to make him alive go and do what
[37:23] you want to do with it but he said he
[37:26] didn't know
[37:27] why because he hadn't heard divorce of
[37:29] God
[37:30] he was only told if you run a thorough
[37:32] search he was told out in Tucson by the
[37:35] the cloud and the things and the angels
[37:37] he was actually told go back to
[37:39] Jeffersonville you need those I'll find
[37:41] them for you it'll be told to you what
[37:44] will happen he comes back to
[37:45] Jeffersonville he does not know what
[37:48] those seals were he had his own idea he
[37:52] was studying the message now if you
[37:53] don't believe me read the first seal he
[37:55] was studying the message from his old
[37:57] notes
[37:59] that he had preached that the white
[38:01] horse rider was the Holy Ghost that's
[38:04] right yep under his old notes he had
[38:07] preached that
[38:08] the demon the Lord broke the seal to him
[38:11] and he saw the white horse rider was the
[38:13] Antichrist
[38:15] he then he he brought it out go read
[38:17] that he said I'd have made a horrible
[38:18] mistake if the Holy Spirit hadn't come
[38:21] and straightened me out well he was
[38:22] going to preach you from his old notes
[38:24] you read the book get to see a book
[38:26] we've glad to run all these quotes
[38:27] through we've been there just 40 years
[38:28] we already know a little bit but all
[38:31] right but see then what he turned out to
[38:33] telling us
[38:35] that the Thunder is the voice of God
[38:39] when the seal opened
[38:41] well they were selling seals
[38:45] see the voice of God had told him what
[38:47] the first seal was
[38:48] didn't tell him what the second seal was
[38:50] that's right
[38:52] until the second day of it right and
[38:55] then the one on the second didn't tell
[38:57] him he's already got two Thunders but he
[38:58] doesn't know what the third one is
[38:59] you're coming down with me you follow me
[39:01] right right so something happened to the
[39:03] prophet what the seven Thunders broke
[39:05] right man he gets over to the seventh
[39:08] seal he said that's what it's been this
[39:09] week
[39:10] it's been the voice of God
[39:13] the seven thunders in Revelations 10 are
[39:16] the is the voice of God speaking to the
[39:18] prophet to tell him what those seals are
[39:20] what else they're going to make it all
[39:21] right amen that's what people has asked
[39:24] me questions about it you know well I
[39:25] just tell you what the prophet said
[39:27] oh but you don't understand brother so
[39:30] and so says is this and I just feel it's
[39:32] that it just gets me good yeah
[39:35] a good piece of ice running down your
[39:37] back will give you chills
[39:39] I'm not sarcastic I'm truthful all right
[39:42] man we've done been through the evidence
[39:44] of the baptism when the Holy Ghost is
[39:45] not shouting speaking in tongues Etc the
[39:48] evidence is whether or not the spirit in
[39:49] you agrees with the word
[39:51] you can do every bit of that until be
[39:53] lost and die and go to hell that's right
[39:55] all right amen see Ephesians prophecies
[39:57] and everything else amen that's right
[39:59] that's what Paul said do I have tone to
[40:02] this and that and the other
[40:04] and have not charity right all right and
[40:08] it's time to settle down then to you
[40:10] that are listening and hadn't heard
[40:11] these things before Where Have You Been
[40:13] first off but second off you have an
[40:15] opportunity to hear amen that's right
[40:18] what is the thunder the voice of God
[40:21] what is the seven Thunders
[40:24] the divorce of God through each seal
[40:26] right amen there were seven seals
[40:29] and the voice of God sent it to the
[40:31] prophet the voice in the Bible was one
[40:34] Thunder the one in Arizona was one
[40:36] Thunder but he'd come back to
[40:37] Jeffersonville not knowing what those
[40:39] seals were
[40:42] nice people that believe he know it all
[40:43] along what everything was well now you
[40:45] making him a liar so go ahead I'm sorry
[40:48] all right
[40:49] all right amen he said he didn't right I
[40:52] see you make him a liar I mean I'm sorry
[40:56] I heard people's feelings being that
[40:58] hateful and speaking but what else can I
[41:00] say
[41:02] how do we grow up and be you know men
[41:05] and women of the Gospel you see what the
[41:09] end time has got that's why we've been
[41:11] here all of these years right it's
[41:14] because the people have been scared of
[41:16] the message
[41:18] oh don't get enough
[41:22] for the prophet's broken why can't we
[41:24] stream that's right right Hallelujah she
[41:28] did not come along and I say well do you
[41:30] understand Daniel 70 weeks and they say
[41:31] no
[41:32] I said well I'm sorry you don't
[41:33] understand what you see your car that's
[41:35] right well who are you tell me
[41:38] let me quote run around
[41:41] he said if you don't understand Daniel
[41:42] 's 70 weeks it's in the Daniel 70 week
[41:45] series third 62. if you don't understand
[41:49] Daniel 70 weeks you cannot understand
[41:51] the seals that's what he said amen
[41:55] let's tell me all about it
[41:59] I see people with bypassed right because
[42:02] they don't want that Thunder being the
[42:03] voice of God they want it to be what the
[42:05] brothers has tried to make it
[42:08] unless you don't get down to it a minute
[42:15] you know what's going through number
[42:17] three brother
[42:19] just keep laying it down then we'll get
[42:20] back to where we'll read that where the
[42:22] Prophet looks where the people say and
[42:24] his thousands of Little Voices
[42:27] yeah they want something like that well
[42:28] I do too
[42:30] look what your Prophet had to say this
[42:32] is all for questions and answers out of
[42:34] the seven Thunders 1964 8 30 8 30 the
[42:39] evening service
[42:40] how the seven Thunders which equals
[42:42] seven Mysteries already been revealed
[42:44] where they revealed in the Seven Seals
[42:46] but are yet but are yet not known to us
[42:48] as the seven as the Thunders yet and
[42:51] watch it no
[42:54] they were revealed in the seventh seal
[42:57] that's what the Thunders was about
[43:01] amen the Seven Seals is what the
[43:03] Thunders was about to read it
[43:06] they wish to reveal the seventh Thunders
[43:08] that had other divorces and no one could
[43:10] make out what it was John knew what it
[43:12] was but he was forbidden to write it he
[43:14] said but the seventh angel in the days
[43:16] of his sounding the seven Mysteries of
[43:19] the seven Thunders would be revealed and
[43:21] the seventh angel is a messenger of the
[43:24] seventh Church age see
[43:26] do we have to have depend upon what the
[43:28] prophet had to say because that's where
[43:31] we hear the voice of God Amen Pride
[43:34] the prophet of God was the voice of God
[43:36] to this age right amen and we don't hear
[43:38] that voice that's right amen
[43:41] me not all of what US preachers saying
[43:44] he is
[43:48] but what God says it is
[43:53] you see what you don't ever understand
[43:54] brother the Thunders what's the new name
[43:58] you know what the Thunders are you know
[44:00] what the new name is I know the name
[44:02] Jesus and I'm gonna hang on to that for
[44:03] something that's happened because I can
[44:05] show you where brother Brown said it'll
[44:07] be made known when we get there when you
[44:09] go ahead and do what you want to
[44:12] but you see that's where people don't
[44:14] study the message they want some sugar
[44:16] tits
[44:17] yeah something to make them feel good
[44:21] now
[44:22] watch what I said I said I'd show this
[44:24] so look at the next one Statue of
[44:26] perfect man 1962 10-14
[44:30] just one little nod from God
[44:33] that done it just assume why
[44:35] how could they know it was a nod from
[44:38] God they had all these virtues in here
[44:40] all these qualifications
[44:42] another disciples had the virtues but
[44:45] they didn't know what the Thunders were
[44:49] the prophet had the virtues
[44:54] yep come on you're going to argue he
[44:56] didn't have the virtues up in 62.
[44:59] I can quote pretty good you know sure
[45:02] you said when he went beyond the curtain
[45:03] of time he said I preached exactly what
[45:05] Paul preached
[45:09] he said ain't got the same results
[45:14] dude that's where people will say well
[45:15] now up until 62 you can't trust what
[45:17] he's saying why not
[45:19] that's right you show me how you
[45:22] understand after 63 when we're not
[45:23] taking what's before 63 and
[45:27] I mean you're you're all messed up
[45:30] you mean the angel of the Lord would
[45:32] have come to him that's what people just
[45:34] preach there's doctrines that that the
[45:36] son of man come to straighten brother
[45:38] Brown and Mike
[45:41] of course you know what they're saying
[45:42] right
[45:44] right I'm the guy that straightened him
[45:47] out
[45:48] he never didn't even believe it
[45:51] you gotta come to me I'm the one to
[45:53] straighten him out
[45:55] okay
[45:59] was up to Jeffersonville in 1968 I guess
[46:02] it was somewhere right along in there
[46:04] and the doctrine back then was who was
[46:07] to take over in lead us
[46:10] who was to lead us now that brought
[46:12] around was off the scene
[46:14] who was the Elijah of this day
[46:21] brother brother Billy Paul got up and
[46:23] read a quote from wrote around that I
[46:24] really thoroughly enjoyed
[46:27] brother Reynolds said the Elijah this
[46:29] day is the holy spirit that's right amen
[46:35] come on brother
[46:38] everybody look into who we follow yeah
[46:42] what's the matter we got the Holy Spirit
[46:44] here come on all right man I thought
[46:46] we're supposed to follow him
[46:50] come on
[46:52] that's why the Bible says you have no
[46:54] man needing that no man teach you that
[46:56] doesn't do away with teachers in a
[46:57] powerful ministry right that places it
[46:59] right amen you have the Holy Spirit
[47:03] the Holy Spirit can tell you whether or
[47:05] not I'm telling you the truth right
[47:06] right yeah
[47:08] it's the only one that can tell you
[47:09] whether or not I'm going to save you
[47:10] right sure
[47:13] all right
[47:16] but I can't receive the Holy Spirit
[47:19] amen it will correct us
[47:22] all right
[47:24] but look what he's saying now
[47:26] those disciples had the virtues but did
[47:29] they have the Thunders
[47:31] I didn't even know anything about the
[47:33] time
[47:35] you're never even been brought out
[47:39] yeah
[47:40] because it would be in the seals it
[47:41] would be brought out to the prophet
[47:43] right
[47:43] you see where you're going wrong by
[47:45] saying that the seven Thunders through
[47:47] the Seven Virtues now here's the the
[47:48] quote that they go by 19 I said 61 it
[47:51] was 1961. uh Revelation chapter four
[47:55] which is uh paragraph 120
[47:58] 1960 108. all right
[48:02] here was moishes oh how we need in
[48:06] Jeffersonville thousands of live voices
[48:08] the Thunder of God thundering out into
[48:11] sweetness and Holiness Purity undefined
[48:14] lives walking around in the Earth today
[48:17] without a blemish yes sir real Christian
[48:19] that's that's Thunder against the enemy
[48:25] yeah the Thunder is what shakes the
[48:28] devil but the last one
[48:32] but when you know what that Thunder is
[48:34] Satan can't do anything with you
[48:38] the Thunder's the voice of God
[48:40] when he speaks to you the revelation of
[48:43] the seals amen
[48:47] all right for you to speak to the
[48:49] prophet and tell him what it is
[48:50] all right
[48:52] but if he don't speak to you and I tell
[48:54] us what those seals are
[48:57] then we've missed the whole voice of God
[49:00] if the prophet's message was to begin in
[49:03] 63 that's what he said
[49:07] then those Thunders would be connected
[49:10] in his message right to be able to be
[49:12] brought to us
[49:15] to bring us to Rapture and Faith right
[49:20] not so man to be followed that's right
[49:24] what do you think about brother so and
[49:25] so fine Brother
[49:30] a lot of good people in this message
[49:33] it's got all kind of doctrines
[49:36] amen
[49:38] and I will as I said I won't call names
[49:41] now I will say it this way
[49:44] when we're in Bible study sometime on
[49:46] Saturday if you will someone ask me who
[49:50] are those that follow these certain
[49:53] doctrines one two three four five six
[49:56] seven I will name them dark
[49:59] that's the best of my understanding
[50:02] I still have anything against them right
[50:05] now how's our brother
[50:08] and the old saying about the old ending
[50:10] you know
[50:11] brother Prairie green used to talk about
[50:13] something brother randomly quoted you
[50:14] know don't say nothing about him Anthony
[50:16] walk in his shoes
[50:18] you don't know where a man's come from
[50:21] oh it one day was an enemy
[50:24] to the church that's right having them
[50:26] killed
[50:28] causing them to blaspheme
[50:30] and the next day he was the leader of
[50:33] the church right right
[50:36] higher than even the apostles were
[50:39] so Peter said he says thank hard to be
[50:41] understood
[50:43] so just don't throw off on nobody
[50:46] remember where we came from
[50:51] man
[50:53] there was a day when some of you believe
[50:55] some of these doctrines
[50:57] stick move cover
[51:02] but where did we come from see we came
[51:04] from that
[51:06] so who can throw off on anybody
[51:11] my life first time we went to
[51:13] Jeffersonville I went around and come
[51:15] back and brother molt was over there and
[51:17] was up in the old Armory building
[51:18] brother mode I was just dying to laugh
[51:20] and he said what is wrong with you I
[51:23] said well brother
[51:25] I said well over here this one group
[51:28] and they said we're all old brothers in
[51:30] the message and this happened now
[51:32] unless they were all saying if you
[51:34] didn't see brother Branham you wouldn't
[51:36] urge a witness to him then you can't
[51:38] make it you know you got to be able to
[51:41] see him and know how he spoke and the
[51:44] way he done things to be able to
[51:46] understand him
[51:47] well I walked over to another group and
[51:49] all these was kind of my age you know
[51:52] younger then of course it's been a while
[51:55] ago you know and a lot of the young
[51:57] ministers that are today old ministers
[51:59] they uh they were talking and they said
[52:02] well you know
[52:05] it was all of the 20 years and older
[52:07] died off
[52:09] all them it's seen
[52:11] you know wrote around them in other
[52:13] words Moses you know said they all died
[52:15] young
[52:17] so it's left us under 20 we didn't get
[52:19] to see the prophet we take over and go
[52:21] on I was just dying the laughing I said
[52:25] where do we fit you know what do we do
[52:27] yeah yeah but
[52:31] we've been going on
[52:33] that's right but now listen to what
[52:35] you're getting to
[52:37] see thousands of Little voices I agree
[52:40] with that
[52:41] that's right
[52:42] because Paul
[52:44] thundered his message to the first
[52:46] church age yes he did
[52:49] Peter thundered on the day of
[52:50] pentecost's message to the church amen
[52:55] well brother Randleman
[52:57] 47 thundered for it the voice and that
[53:02] voice kept increasing by the knowledge
[53:05] of understanding that God opened to him
[53:07] and he stood there in 62 and he said I
[53:10] preached exactly what Paul preached
[53:14] he said now where they believed in one
[53:16] God
[53:17] I believed in it
[53:20] and God remember could lead a prophet
[53:22] because down Through the Ages I admit
[53:25] that down Through the Ages
[53:28] let's see brother Brown covers and I'll
[53:31] give you these if you like it let the
[53:32] pure unadulterated word went into the
[53:34] ground at the fourth Church age
[53:37] I can give you that quote if you like it
[53:38] because it started and kept on going up
[53:41] until Colombia and and uh you know when
[53:44] you're coming down up and you got up
[53:45] here to Columbus every how you
[53:47] pronounced his word uh up to that age
[53:50] they had to Pure unadulterated word but
[53:53] then the Catholic Church hid the word
[53:54] from the people and Martin Luther could
[53:57] only come out with a just you'll live by
[53:59] faith but you know what that was that
[54:00] was the new bird of that age you know
[54:03] what that was that was God thundering
[54:05] through Martin Luther the to just shall
[54:08] live by faith thousands of Little Voices
[54:10] went forth in his age to conquer the
[54:13] Catholic church and their ideas and
[54:15] doings Right Wesley come along stepping
[54:18] up a little higher got thundering
[54:20] through that right
[54:22] but now where they were in the Statue of
[54:24] perfect man is hard to understand
[54:26] because
[54:28] I believe they got there at Faith by the
[54:30] new birth
[54:32] but did they get these virtues how many
[54:34] I don't know
[54:36] maybe some had different things just
[54:38] cause you got knowledge of the message
[54:39] don't give you Holy Ghost knowledge
[54:40] that's right it's because you've got a
[54:43] Temperance because you can control your
[54:45] temper don't mean the Holy Ghost
[54:46] Temperance right right all right you
[54:49] understand what I'm saying see then the
[54:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost on the juicer
[54:52] Street coming back
[54:54] but still see there was no one there to
[54:56] teach the people because that was what
[54:58] Peter was doing
[55:00] Peter was in second Peter he was
[55:02] teaching others because remember how I
[55:05] preached to you the 120 in the upper
[55:07] room God never used novices to write the
[55:09] Bible
[55:11] to use those that were anchored into
[55:12] work right man all right and those that
[55:15] got anchored into work could be used to
[55:17] bring forth the message right all right
[55:19] and the people of that day when they
[55:21] were born again remember we've we've
[55:22] divided it to where we'd understand and
[55:24] deceived and that would be very valuable
[55:25] that everybody that's born again is born
[55:28] again at Faith I believe amen but that
[55:31] don't put us all the way up in the
[55:32] pyramid we've got to grow in that all
[55:35] right just cause your age you're born
[55:36] then doesn't put you brotherly kindness
[55:38] that's right that's Philadelphia that's
[55:39] the that's the city upcoming
[55:41] Philadelphia that's brotherly kindness
[55:43] you
[55:44] because that's what it means and you go
[55:47] up there and you run over by car you say
[55:50] that's my brother
[55:52] it'd be hard to believe all right yeah
[55:54] but yeah
[55:57] gee I don't believe that I'm just
[55:59] telling your personal opinion now I
[56:00] don't believe that through Luther's age
[56:02] what's his age and Azusa Street
[56:04] Pentecost that they could have crime
[56:06] very high in the pyramid right sure if
[56:08] you can show me something right around
[56:09] says and I will be glad to accept you
[56:11] but I just don't believe personally they
[56:13] could climb very high because it's
[56:14] according to the amount of words you
[56:16] receive all right now but here comes a
[56:19] prophet
[56:21] yep he said it took it 30 something
[56:24] years
[56:26] go to stature perfect man to see what
[56:28] I'm saying it took him 30 something
[56:30] years before he could preach him
[56:36] go back in
[56:37] 1955 or 56 on a message the Old Timer
[56:41] used to be Intervale
[56:44] and look at what he's saying about how
[56:47] that God wants to use your voice to
[56:49] speak to people God wants to speak
[56:51] through you go through all of your
[56:53] adoption series
[56:55] the adoption series was basically up and
[56:58] just maybe one or two message on
[56:59] adoption that's really titled adoption
[57:01] with only they were all in between the
[57:04] 40s and the the 62.
[57:09] go check it see because that's what he
[57:11] was doing he was teaching her doctor 30
[57:12] something years to teach that amen you
[57:15] know why
[57:16] that I believe him
[57:18] because he was gaining ground of his own
[57:20] self see he was a prophet
[57:22] you and I can't come up that stature
[57:24] perfect man you see somebody now I'm not
[57:26] throwing off on him just telling you
[57:27] like I'm leaving okay you say well this
[57:29] man over here because now he's hurt
[57:30] around I don't know how much he's read
[57:32] but that's all right we'll see somebody
[57:34] down the road down there ain't never
[57:35] heard of run around you tell me he's got
[57:37] stature perfect man I'm gonna tell you I
[57:39] don't agree with you
[57:40] well that man's got virtue that man's
[57:43] got patience and all right
[57:46] all right we ain't got holy
[57:48] Holy Ghost that's right he ain't got
[57:50] Holy Ghost knowledge question him a
[57:52] little bit on the word you'll find out
[57:54] that's right
[57:55] because he's got the virtues and things
[57:57] the apostles had he'll agree with what
[58:00] the apostles said
[58:02] that's right sure there's wonderful
[58:04] people out there I've always said that
[58:06] to you there's wonderful people in those
[58:08] churches they're preachers out there in
[58:10] a more the more
[58:12] um qualified to preach than I am
[58:14] I'm talking about live wiser of being so
[58:17] sweet and humble and nice and and great
[58:21] potential don't mean it so we're in the
[58:24] day that the word's got to be right amen
[58:26] that's right around was a prophet amen
[58:29] so God could carry him up the pyramid
[58:31] you get it nice
[58:33] he could bring him through from Faith to
[58:36] Virtue and knowledge to temper to
[58:38] patient to Godliness to brotherly
[58:40] kindness all right
[58:45] and you notice I stopped
[58:50] I didn't bring our love all right
[58:53] right
[58:54] because I believe this message was The
[58:56] Headstone amen whether you believe it or
[58:58] not
[59:00] I believe this message wrote around
[59:01] abroad was The Headstone manager all
[59:04] right
[59:06] and see that hasn't come yet right
[59:09] then we'll give you a couple of quotes
[59:11] it's your order not over just pull up
[59:13] number six
[59:17] look what he said on adoption 1965-22 in
[59:20] the evening we'll just get a little
[59:21] point then I gotta hurry
[59:22] the pyramid never was capped was it
[59:27] the pyramid there's no cap on it all
[59:29] right that's the one he's always
[59:31] referring to I guess that's the way you
[59:32] pronounce it something close to it never
[59:34] did have a couch don't put on they never
[59:36] couldn't even find it they don't know
[59:38] what ever happened to it why if I wasn't
[59:41] the cats don't put on bad stuff the top
[59:43] of it because he was rejected when he
[59:45] come he was rejected Stone that's right
[59:48] but it will be capped that's right and
[59:50] then those stones that fit around that
[59:52] headstone will have to be stoned like
[59:55] that'll be so completely like that stone
[59:57] till it's been ever join and everywhere
[59:59] amen did The Headstone did not come
[1:00:04] all right all right let me just quote
[1:00:06] these and then if you want them you can
[1:00:07] have a future home
[1:00:09] 1964-802 that's the reason the Capstone
[1:00:11] wasn't put on by Ena see that's the
[1:00:14] reason the Capstone has to come now
[1:00:19] the mountain will be pushed up and it'll
[1:00:21] be the Mount of the Lord
[1:00:23] dedication 62 11-11 in the morning
[1:00:26] service now we already have the stones
[1:00:29] the stones God for ordained see and
[1:00:32] we've got them all the way from Ephesus
[1:00:34] to ladyocila we're we're only waiting
[1:00:37] for that headstone that the builders
[1:00:40] rejected waiting for his coming the
[1:00:42] captain Stone
[1:00:44] hmm
[1:00:51] is this the sign of the end sir 1962 12
[1:00:54] 30. this that is this the mystery
[1:00:58] of the Thunders that will bring back
[1:01:01] that headstone
[1:01:04] for flatten up Brothers number nine and
[1:01:07] let them read it
[1:01:09] but pyramid never was kept I guess
[1:01:11] you're ahead of me putting them up in
[1:01:12] them you know the headstone is yet to
[1:01:15] come
[1:01:16] it's been rejected
[1:01:18] see The Headstone had to become the
[1:01:19] Cornerstone that's right of the church
[1:01:22] right
[1:01:24] cause The Headstone was crashed right
[1:01:27] and he's a Cornerstone
[1:01:29] well you couldn't manifest yourself as a
[1:01:31] headstone It could only manifest itself
[1:01:32] at the Cornerstone
[1:01:34] he couldn't manifest himself up here as
[1:01:36] as the point of love yet love was there
[1:01:39] but he manifested himself as Christ
[1:01:42] right
[1:01:43] waiting till the end time
[1:01:46] number 10 go ahead put them up make them
[1:01:49] real just like the pyramid that's in the
[1:01:50] middle that's 1964 8 23 in the evening
[1:01:53] this is after the shield bro
[1:01:55] and we find in that pyramid they never
[1:01:57] did get the headstone on it why The
[1:02:00] Headstone Is Yet To Come the seven steps
[1:02:02] in the pyramid will go through that
[1:02:03] someday it's just like to show you how
[1:02:06] it really is perfectly with the
[1:02:07] scripture the man here that can turn on
[1:02:09] the lights or turn on the lights reach
[1:02:11] 1964-125
[1:02:13] they don't know where it's at now when
[1:02:16] that headstone returns it'll be just
[1:02:18] like the rest of it it will blend in
[1:02:20] with it with the stone that's left open
[1:02:24] if you should put the headstone on it
[1:02:26] it'll have to be that way and when Jesus
[1:02:29] returns he'll find a church that's
[1:02:31] washed without Sparta wrinkle and it'll
[1:02:33] be the same Ministry hey he had it'll
[1:02:36] bring back The Headstone man
[1:02:38] all right
[1:02:40] see the pyramid never was count
[1:02:43] the natural pyramid because what type of
[1:02:45] Christ in the church
[1:02:48] The Headstone did not come I believe the
[1:02:50] headstone to this church is the seals
[1:02:52] that broke to the prophet his message
[1:02:53] not just say single get his message his
[1:02:56] message begun in the seals now I prove
[1:02:58] that to you he said not in the years of
[1:03:00] preparation et cetera et cetera future
[1:03:02] humble but when he began to sound his
[1:03:04] message
[1:03:05] run around had to come and do a work of
[1:03:07] restoration go back and pick up that and
[1:03:11] teach these virtues here to us teach
[1:03:14] these the message to bring us up through
[1:03:17] there in the virtues all right and I
[1:03:20] believe he stood there in 1963.
[1:03:23] with that church ready
[1:03:25] I mean that him ready not his church
[1:03:27] because it wasn't ready at that time
[1:03:30] the church wasn't he was ready and God
[1:03:33] took him to Arizona and kept him off
[1:03:34] right I believe that's his adoption you
[1:03:36] can believe what you want to you can say
[1:03:38] well it was in his early ministry that's
[1:03:39] fine I'm not going to argue with you
[1:03:41] about it I'm just going to ask you
[1:03:42] where's the quote
[1:03:43] I can show you where the Prophet said
[1:03:46] that when the Capstone comes what it
[1:03:48] would do
[1:03:49] all right and you can see that's what it
[1:03:51] done in 1963 when the prophet him though
[1:03:53] was done and even until now they've got
[1:03:56] the doctrines that the Lord came to the
[1:03:57] Earth in 63 and this that and the other
[1:04:00] all kind of things
[1:04:02] you know there's all kind of doctrines
[1:04:03] in this message about 63 and and all of
[1:04:06] those and 77s and and all of those I'm
[1:04:10] not concerned about that I'm concerned
[1:04:11] with one thing
[1:04:13] trying to get me and you to see Jesus
[1:04:14] Christ
[1:04:15] and Jesus Christ come and met the
[1:04:18] prophet there in 1963 and he brought him
[1:04:20] his message to deliver you go in the
[1:04:23] messages you just go and ask you to do
[1:04:25] this just get a book that's Timeless the
[1:04:27] tapes you know what I'm talking about
[1:04:29] the book that you index book and just
[1:04:31] read the titles
[1:04:35] and you'll see that 1963 brother rounds
[1:04:38] message went into eternity future home
[1:04:41] things that are to be Christ mystery God
[1:04:43] revealed he'd always preach one true and
[1:04:45] living God right money to death preached
[1:04:47] Christ the mystery God revealed over
[1:04:48] again
[1:04:50] he always preached who Melchizedek was
[1:04:53] but then he preach who is this male
[1:04:55] Chestnut brought it down to the people
[1:04:58] you see what I'm talking about this
[1:05:00] message is to bring you and I to that
[1:05:01] place amen right and I agree we'll give
[1:05:04] you the quote right you don't know
[1:05:05] Brothers the last one
[1:05:07] 327 Church age book I agree with this
[1:05:11] now this message your Malachi 4 and Luke
[1:05:13] in Revelation 10 7 is going to do two
[1:05:15] things one according to Malachi 4 he'll
[1:05:17] turn the hearts of the children back
[1:05:19] children to the father phase number one
[1:05:23] the reason is Phase number one is
[1:05:26] because that's got to happen before we
[1:05:27] really know where we're at that's right
[1:05:29] you and I are going to have to be turned
[1:05:31] back to the faith of the fathers before
[1:05:32] we know where we're at and were you
[1:05:34] hearing the message now anybody
[1:05:35] preaching Faith to the father
[1:05:37] come on
[1:05:39] I'm open on that show me
[1:05:42] they don't talk about faith of the
[1:05:44] fathers in the morning
[1:05:45] it's these great Revelations
[1:05:49] and it goes off the message
[1:05:52] right
[1:05:53] look what he goes on the site now two he
[1:05:56] will reveal the mysteries of the seven
[1:05:57] thunders in Revelation 10 which are the
[1:05:59] Revelation contained in the Seven Seals
[1:06:02] now watch I love this it'll be these
[1:06:04] divinely revealed mystery truths that
[1:06:06] literally turn the hearts of the
[1:06:07] children to the Pentecostal fathers
[1:06:09] exactly so
[1:06:11] run around come and brought the message
[1:06:13] to you and I
[1:06:15] God took him off to say
[1:06:18] because his message was to live it's not
[1:06:20] giving you the other day where the
[1:06:21] Prophet said this bride is to vindicate
[1:06:23] Malachi 4. Luke 17 30. vindicate amen I
[1:06:28] believe that I believe that the Thunders
[1:06:31] right the voice of God when the seal
[1:06:33] broke and when those seals break to you
[1:06:36] and I it can build a statue of a perfect
[1:06:38] man into you and I all right man
[1:06:41] and without those things we don't have
[1:06:44] it all right I don't care how much you
[1:06:46] call virtue whatever you got or whatever
[1:06:48] you call knowledges and temperatures and
[1:06:50] things if it ain't Holy Ghost
[1:06:52] temperance
[1:06:55] amen you say oh now brother there we
[1:06:58] know the difference yeah you used to
[1:06:59] interpret the word Temperance as meaning
[1:07:01] not to drink alcohol
[1:07:05] right right
[1:07:09] come on I hope too with a profit
[1:07:12] he said that's not what it is not to
[1:07:14] drink alcohol he said it's that
[1:07:16] uncontrollable temper you got
[1:07:20] my brother
[1:07:21] and I got bored again I got you were
[1:07:23] going to call it faith I got born again
[1:07:25] I don't have no temper in me well why do
[1:07:27] you need Temperance for
[1:07:30] all right
[1:07:31] Miss God and I got the Holy Ghost I got
[1:07:34] all the patience in the world you trying
[1:07:35] to prove that to me or you
[1:07:37] yeah I had all the knowledge where'd you
[1:07:40] get it from
[1:07:43] church I can take all these doctrines if
[1:07:46] you want to spend time and show you that
[1:07:48] everyone come out of Genesis that's what
[1:07:51] your Prophet said that's right and all
[1:07:53] of these doctrines
[1:07:55] yep come from the churches they come
[1:07:58] from
[1:08:00] the Mormon Doctrine is that
[1:08:03] who sows
[1:08:07] two Lords come down from worth it the
[1:08:09] baddest had two seeds in the spirit
[1:08:11] Doctrine
[1:08:14] right
[1:08:17] River Jordan come from work
[1:08:20] he went gone to the River Jordan
[1:08:21] corinthius is that the way he pronounced
[1:08:23] his name in the time of John the do
[1:08:26] right away writer John in other words
[1:08:28] about 80 50. serenthius was teaching I
[1:08:32] gave it to you Wednesday night
[1:08:34] that Jesus was not the substance of God
[1:08:39] a good old-fashioned Baptist Doctrine
[1:08:42] God in three persons Blessed Trinity
[1:08:46] co-equal and co-eternal
[1:08:50] sure you see what I'm talking about
[1:08:53] these doctors are not you
[1:09:00] their Spirits they come down from those
[1:09:03] others who had the doctrine you want a
[1:09:06] good Baptist a good bad news spirit
[1:09:09] I just believe the prophet I believe
[1:09:12] everything the prophet never say
[1:09:14] yep well when it's word says for sake
[1:09:15] not to sin well now I don't believe that
[1:09:19] I believe everybody else
[1:09:21] well that ain't good bad news comes back
[1:09:23] and said to believe everything he said
[1:09:25] you get what I'm talking about
[1:09:28] that's right
[1:09:30] not trying to show smarter like no
[1:09:33] because I don't covered it we all come
[1:09:35] off of the tree
[1:09:37] you and I fell off of some tree
[1:09:39] somewhere
[1:09:42] right but what's the worst part of
[1:09:44] people don't want somebody to stay with
[1:09:46] the truth and can tell you and say well
[1:09:48] all right you showed me they don't want
[1:09:50] to hear that
[1:09:51] you showed me where I ever followed any
[1:09:53] of those doctrines and I studied them
[1:09:55] ever won and knew the three or four that
[1:09:58] I've covered I knew the people
[1:09:59] personally
[1:10:02] that started them
[1:10:06] the church I'm sorry
[1:10:08] I just stay on one thing let's stay with
[1:10:11] the prophet amen that's right you're
[1:10:14] just stubborn okay thank you just don't
[1:10:17] make me a meal
[1:10:20] make me a donkey but not a meal all
[1:10:23] right yeah all right
[1:10:27] but listen
[1:10:29] that's why I don't believe the virtue
[1:10:30] see it would have been impossible for
[1:10:32] the disciples that had the Thunders
[1:10:37] you said well John heard it that's right
[1:10:38] but it was taken totally away from him
[1:10:40] and sealed up to where he could never
[1:10:42] say nothing about it because you showed
[1:10:43] me he did
[1:10:47] Daniel heard the Thunders and that's
[1:10:50] your Prophet had to say
[1:10:52] but he said it was sealed up until the
[1:10:54] end time
[1:10:57] that's right that's why it's not the
[1:10:59] virtues but the Thunders as we read
[1:11:01] after life the Thunders of God
[1:11:03] thundering forth the Thunder of God
[1:11:05] thundering forth through the prophet of
[1:11:07] God to bring us to revelation of the
[1:11:09] seals and tell us what the Thunders were
[1:11:11] can now Thunder through our lives
[1:11:17] he can Thunder his voice through our
[1:11:19] lives out to the people yeah
[1:11:21] they can see Christ
[1:11:29] and just like I started off giving you
[1:11:31] mathematically people don't even keep
[1:11:33] things straight
[1:11:36] seven eyes
[1:11:39] if you look at that pyramid behind you
[1:11:41] and you count these eight things back
[1:11:43] there
[1:11:45] Faith virtue and Only temperation God
[1:11:47] doesn't really kindness and religions no
[1:11:49] there's not written in the Bible but
[1:11:50] there's an extra one in there even said
[1:11:52] the Holy Spirit
[1:11:59] the disciples had these virtues he said
[1:12:02] they had the genuine
[1:12:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:07] now we're going to get to it this
[1:12:08] evening where people says we know how
[1:12:10] the Holy Ghost now like it did in the
[1:12:12] Bible
[1:12:14] of course you know what that is
[1:12:16] the man that believed in the Thunder
[1:12:17] said I'll tell you when you got the
[1:12:18] virtues
[1:12:20] the man that had the doctrine of no Holy
[1:12:23] Ghost Doctrine is what it's called
[1:12:27] he was the one going to tell you when
[1:12:29] you got it
[1:12:33] see there ain't no way I can tell you
[1:12:34] when you got anything right
[1:12:38] don't come to me and Ashley's brother
[1:12:39] Dave do you think I got it I said I
[1:12:42] don't know you must be questioning
[1:12:43] something because you're sure we're
[1:12:45] talking like you're negative
[1:12:46] you mean you don't know
[1:12:49] I love what brought around said come on
[1:12:51] brother I love what he said about it
[1:12:53] he said anything but one person
[1:12:56] going in Georgia
[1:12:58] all of you got to find you another state
[1:13:02] because I'm the one
[1:13:06] but he said if you don't believe that
[1:13:10] right whether Benny if you don't believe
[1:13:13] you're that one you better start
[1:13:15] searching for that one right right
[1:13:18] because you got to say you're the one
[1:13:20] amen right
[1:13:22] Sister Barbara you got to say you're the
[1:13:24] one
[1:13:26] don't say it with my pastor I know he's
[1:13:28] going to be there you don't know whether
[1:13:30] I'm gonna be there or not
[1:13:32] that's right
[1:13:34] and that don't prop me up for you to say
[1:13:36] that
[1:13:39] if I'm lost I'm lost
[1:13:42] you gotta have the thing
[1:13:44] you gotta have virtue you gotta have
[1:13:46] knowledge you gotta have temperatures
[1:13:48] you gotta have them yeah
[1:13:50] patience you got to have the baptism of
[1:13:52] the Holy Days amen that's right for your
[1:13:55] own heart and life amen you got to be in
[1:13:57] Christ
[1:13:59] now let's get down to one okay
[1:14:03] one thing
[1:14:05] but you can claim all them virtues and
[1:14:08] if you differ with the word
[1:14:11] then you know for sure
[1:14:15] you're not right that's right
[1:14:19] If you deny anything you show me any
[1:14:22] word that I've ever denied anything this
[1:14:24] Bible says and this Prophet had to say
[1:14:28] come and show me
[1:14:31] now I'm not a word or something I
[1:14:33] slipped a tongue
[1:14:35] you know
[1:14:36] don't do it that way that's silly that's
[1:14:38] not
[1:14:39] that's like this too wide two Blind Men
[1:14:42] or the one blind man that's I'm I don't
[1:14:44] don't be silly don't
[1:14:46] you know
[1:14:47] let's be honest and sincere
[1:14:50] because our lives were Extinction that's
[1:14:53] right
[1:14:56] Brother Richard when I he came here her
[1:14:59] son-in-law he said I didn't know
[1:15:02] that run around said these virtues are
[1:15:05] required
[1:15:08] it's not to be talked about it's a
[1:15:11] requirement to happen
[1:15:13] those that are going to take the change
[1:15:15] of the body are going to have these
[1:15:17] virtues now we may go by the grave and
[1:15:21] somebody have to pull us out yeah right
[1:15:23] but the ones who are direct the moment
[1:15:25] of the change will have these virtues
[1:15:27] sealed in and everything will be right
[1:15:29] the hip Stone will be there
[1:15:38] have a name
[1:15:41] you might have an eight dollars open
[1:17:05] right now
[1:18:21] you're having a heart
[1:18:42] at all as well
[1:19:43] over there
