[10:30] the Lord uh sister GW was requesting
[10:32] pray about the the people there they're
[10:35] from the sister that got killed it was
[10:38] from uh Durham North Carolina and I
[10:42] think she goes to the church where uh
[10:46] Master Robbie Turner Ruby Robby Turner I
[10:51] remember the name and all but I don't
[10:52] remember but she got killed in there
[10:54] Friday so just remember the whole family
[10:56] and everything you know that Lord would
[10:58] be with them and bless each
[11:01] one U Ryan and Gabby was going up to her
[11:05] parents this weekend but I don't know
[11:08] where today got to go or not because his
[11:10] grandfather was real sick so remember
[11:13] that remember Ryan's grandfather and I'm
[11:16] sure they must have went on but remember
[11:18] them the Lord would bless amen you like
[11:21] turn in your scriptures turn in
[11:23] Genesis 32 Genesis
[11:27] 32
[11:30] had a good many comments this morning
[11:32] about what I had said about if you fold
[11:34] your arms you know it means you're not
[11:36] listening but a lot of them said they
[11:38] folded their arm this morning cuz it
[11:43] cold maybe that was a good point it was
[11:47] cold so we try not to freeze you but
[11:49] then the other side's are Fanning so you
[11:51] don't never know which way to run it it
[11:53] doesn't work out amen now what I'm going
[11:55] to do is it it take me about two
[11:57] services but then I'm going to probably
[11:59] put a gap in between so I want you to
[12:02] remember this service and the next one
[12:04] will be a background for something that
[12:06] that the Lord is beginning to deal with
[12:08] me about and I want to start maybe a
[12:11] little series uh in Revelations 5 and
[12:16] try to speak from that but now I may put
[12:18] because i' I've got some questions that
[12:22] I need to cover so you know maybe I'll
[12:24] get to them before I start the series
[12:27] but I just thought this would be a
[12:28] background for it and do it but I've got
[12:31] some questions on got one on marriage
[12:33] and divorce and one on like church order
[12:36] and and things and so we'll we'll try to
[12:39] cover them if we can the Lord willing
[12:41] I'm sure Wade will be ministering this
[12:43] next weekend and you know in doing but
[12:46] we will try to cover these so keep these
[12:49] messages kind of in mind cuz it'll be
[12:51] something more or less personally to you
[12:53] and I and that's what we want to talk
[12:56] about a true personal experience right
[12:58] you know you have a lot of
[13:00] experiences but there's always something
[13:02] that you can label everything or put it
[13:04] back on and anchor it in to a a a time
[13:08] of something that stands out in your
[13:11] life and all like that so just remember
[13:13] that Genesis
[13:14] 32 Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for
[13:17] your love and your grace we thank you
[13:20] most of all for being you and we pray
[13:22] that you would bless us now lead us in
[13:25] understanding and help us to Lord to
[13:27] deliver our hearts and to be you know
[13:30] receptive father as to what you would
[13:32] want us to be where we can speak then
[13:35] from our hearts to the people and just
[13:38] let your light shine Lord with each one
[13:40] remember those that are not with us Ryan
[13:42] and Gabby and W Jun there them and
[13:45] traveling coming back from the things we
[13:46] pray that you would would bless each one
[13:49] bless us here as we gather together to
[13:52] thank on you and to have you as the
[13:55] preeminent one in our hearts and lives
[13:58] we love you father father and we thank
[13:59] you we commit it to you now in Jesus
[14:02] name amen Genesis
[14:05] 32 we'll begin reading about verse 6
[14:08] through maybe 13 and then jump over to
[14:11] just safe reading but I want you to
[14:13] notice that uh verse one it's not up on
[14:16] the board for you to read but uh the
[14:18] angels of God come and met Jacob this is
[14:21] when Jacob had went over you know and
[14:24] pass through bethl went over and he had
[14:27] um dwelt in the land and and got his
[14:29] wife and and everything and the two
[14:32] wives really because he wound up with
[14:35] Leah and then he wound up with Rachel
[14:37] working for then he's on his way back
[14:40] going towards uh where his homeland and
[14:44] remember the Lord is the one that told
[14:45] him to get up and go right so that's
[14:47] what I want us to get now he has many
[14:50] experiences but then he'll have an
[14:53] experience that anchors something that's
[14:55] what the point that I want with all of
[14:57] us we've all had many
[14:59] experiences but then there's something
[15:01] that you can tie your life to that will
[15:04] carry you all the way through see and
[15:06] that that will be the point okay so
[15:09] we'll say time read verse 6-13 and then
[15:11] 23-
[15:13] 28 and The Messengers returned to Jacob
[15:16] saying we we came to thy brother
[15:18] Esau and also he cometh to meet thee and
[15:21] 400 men with him then Jacob was greatly
[15:25] afraid and distressed and he divided the
[15:27] people that was with him and the flocks
[15:29] and the herds and the camels into two
[15:33] Vans and said if Esau come to the one
[15:37] company and smite it then the other
[15:40] company which is left shall
[15:42] escape and Jacob said oh god of My
[15:45] Father
[15:47] Abraham and God of my father Isaac
[15:50] notice him the god of my
[15:54] father all right but watch what he says
[16:00] now notice that even if you look on the
[16:03] board it is it is not in a form of
[16:06] capitalization that he's speaking of in
[16:08] verse 9 and and Jacob said oh god of My
[16:12] Father Abraham and God of my father
[16:16] Isaac but notice what the other the Lord
[16:19] which sth unto
[16:21] me return unto thy country and to thy
[16:24] Kindred and I will deal well with thee I
[16:28] am not wor worthy of the least of the
[16:29] mercies and all of all the truth which
[16:32] thou showed unto thy servant for with my
[16:35] staff I passed over this Jordan and now
[16:37] I am become two
[16:40] bands deliver me I pray thee from the
[16:42] hand of my brother from the hand of Esau
[16:45] for I fear Him lest he will come and
[16:48] smite me and the mother with the
[16:52] children and thou sest I will surely do
[16:56] thee good now this is what Jacob says
[16:58] God has told him and make thy seed as
[17:01] the sand of the sea which cannot be
[17:03] numbered for
[17:06] multitude see get the point now we'll
[17:09] get back to it see he should have known
[17:11] that he was going his brother wasn't
[17:12] going to give him no harm cuz God done
[17:15] told him what's going to take
[17:16] place but see we don't see it that way
[17:20] when we're right in the midst of a lot
[17:21] of trouble A lot of times we don't see
[17:23] the end of it and we don't listen to The
[17:25] Promise that's right you know and all
[17:28] like that it's that's that's what we're
[17:30] doing see that's my point I want you to
[17:32] see and he lodged there for that same
[17:35] night and took of that which came to his
[17:37] hand a present for Esau his brother 200
[17:40] she goats and then going on down now
[17:42] jump over to verse
[17:44] 23 he gets all this over he sends it
[17:46] over gets everything ready maybe trying
[17:49] to appease his
[17:50] brother and he took them and sent them
[17:53] over the brook and sent over that he had
[17:56] and Jacob was left alone and th Wrestled
[17:58] a man with him until the breaking of the
[17:59] day and when he saw that he prevailed
[18:02] not against him he touched the Hallow of
[18:04] his thigh and the Hallow of Jacob's th
[18:07] was out of joint as he wrestled with him
[18:11] and he said let me go for the day breth
[18:14] and he said I will not let thee go
[18:17] except thou bless me and he said unto
[18:20] him what is thy name and he said Jacob
[18:23] he said thy name shall be called No More
[18:26] Jacob for but Israel where as a
[18:30] prince hast thou power with God and with
[18:34] men and H haast notice prevailed you may
[18:38] be seated the Lord had his Blessing to
[18:40] the reading of the
[18:41] word
[18:44] now kind of just give a thought and
[18:46] you'll see that when we do get back to
[18:48] it and pick up something that you'll see
[18:51] we're dealing with a personal experience
[18:53] but I want I titled it true personal
[18:55] experience because of of the fact of uh
[18:59] as having many
[19:00] experiences but somewhere in your life
[19:02] you'll tie down and connect your your
[19:06] life
[19:07] to one
[19:09] thing and that'll be something personal
[19:11] to
[19:12] you he had as I said God sent him told
[19:17] him get up go back go back to your
[19:21] Homeland he gets up he heads out he
[19:23] starts going
[19:24] home and then he finds out his brother's
[19:27] coming to meet him
[19:29] you know
[19:30] now then he meets God or God talks to
[19:35] him and he said now I know like we was
[19:38] emphasizing there that you know I
[19:41] believe in in in in the god of Abraham
[19:43] and the god of
[19:45] Isaac he said now you spoke to me as the
[19:49] Lord you know the god of Heaven the
[19:52] capitalization that emphasizes the fact
[19:54] that he was you know dealing with God
[19:57] was speaking personally to
[19:59] him and he he begins to
[20:02] pray because he's
[20:04] concerned and he he's kind of reminding
[20:07] God that you said you'd do these
[20:10] things well it it's it's it's a fact
[20:13] that in our lives a lot of times that we
[20:16] even though we have great
[20:18] experiences you
[20:21] know it still comes along that Satan you
[20:24] know what will get you over today you
[20:27] know man AR way of saying it but what'll
[20:30] get you over today it won't get you over
[20:34] tomorrow all right each day has to have
[20:37] a personal experience with God that's
[20:40] why the Bible says give us this day our
[20:42] daily bread see it's the point that you
[20:45] you you've got to uh get everything
[20:48] settled today but tomorrow now it that
[20:52] becomes a background material to help us
[20:56] yes a wonderful thing but we need to
[20:59] daily have something dealing with us
[21:01] that's right all right now that'll be
[21:04] the point that we'll be getting to when
[21:05] we get back to Revelations 5 because I
[21:08] believe this this end time people is the
[21:11] only people that can
[21:13] really look into the word of God and see
[21:18] themselves in the word of God and be
[21:21] able to know exactly what's taking place
[21:24] cuz it was not meant for those others
[21:27] it's meant for you and I God doesn't do
[21:30] things foolishly he doesn't provide
[21:32] somebody or or you know he didn't send
[21:34] 14 guys down to deliver the children of
[21:37] Israel out of Egypt see he only sent
[21:40] Moses all right now you know how that
[21:43] I've always preached about Moses see he
[21:45] had had experiences with God he knew
[21:48] from his mother or what this was and
[21:50] what that was and and all like that and
[21:52] he had seen things and he believed it
[21:56] but that wasn't good enough
[21:58] all right he goes out and he he lives
[22:01] and goes into the desert but then when
[22:04] he gets ready to go back see God didn't
[22:06] God come to him and said all right
[22:09] Moses go down and deliver my
[22:13] people and he spoke to Moses and said
[22:16] I'm the god of Abraham Isaac and
[22:19] Jacob well you know how I've always
[22:21] emphasized that Moses said I believe in
[22:23] the god of Abraham I believe in the god
[22:26] of Isaac I believe in the god of Jac
[22:29] all right said I'm not
[22:33] going until I have something
[22:36] personal you know something real to
[22:38] me because see you know we talk about
[22:42] the Scripture it does say you know that
[22:44] that no man can call Jesus the Christ
[22:46] except what by the Holy Ghost brother R
[22:48] said by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[22:50] all right see and you because you don't
[22:54] want to say just what somebody else says
[22:56] yes right and see Jacob said well you
[22:59] know I believe in the god of Abraham I
[23:01] believe in the god of Isaac amen I
[23:03] believe God was with them and he
[23:06] delivered them and brought them through
[23:08] and said I need something myself right
[23:10] right now he's facing his
[23:13] brother all right and his brother done
[23:16] he done been told that his brother's
[23:18] coming to meet him with 400 men all
[23:21] right so he figures pretty well he's
[23:23] going to lose a lot of things all right
[23:27] he tries to make different ways of maybe
[23:29] appeasing so he sends his his you know
[23:34] great inheritance
[23:36] across many cattle many sheep many
[23:39] different things he sends them across
[23:40] ahead of you he sends everything
[23:43] across because he's trying to appease
[23:46] his brother right he's trying to make a
[23:49] way that his brother won't kill him
[23:51] right and you know what if God hadn't
[23:52] stepped on the scene you know what
[23:55] that's exactly what Esau would have done
[23:57] that's right
[23:58] he said well now not about well that's
[24:00] what I'm saying God stepped on the scene
[24:02] because it was his
[24:03] promise the reason he come on the scene
[24:06] to do it was his promise now and notice
[24:09] when you get on over later we spend a
[24:11] lot of talking about Esau and a bad
[24:14] things
[24:15] right but remember when the time Jacob
[24:19] got to Esau he had sent all of his
[24:22] inheritance over he's totally by himself
[24:24] he's even sent his wife and his kids and
[24:27] and everything
[24:28] actually just saying they're yours H
[24:32] you but when he meets ja meets
[24:37] Esau Esau would had a heart changed to
[24:39] him right
[24:42] right Esau didn't want to kill
[24:44] him read your
[24:46] Bible Esau said I don't want your
[24:49] inheritance I'm a rich
[24:53] man Jacob keeps only he finally deals
[24:55] with him until he gives him so much but
[24:59] he certainly didn't take his family and
[25:01] his kids and only he didn't take his
[25:02] life see CU God was already working you
[25:04] heard the prophet say like this he said
[25:06] as long as God's working on both ends
[25:09] right amen now that's the way I want to
[25:12] face things promises all of that's good
[25:16] experience is is
[25:18] good but I want to get to the point to
[25:20] where that I can say this is real and
[25:23] that's what Jacob was doing and he had
[25:26] many many experiences Moses had many
[25:28] many experiences right but when Moses
[25:32] come to that burning bush it was all
[25:35] settled he didn't care what happened
[25:37] down in Egypt he went down to take
[25:40] over amen Jacob sure he had problems but
[25:44] he met
[25:45] God and he said the Lord that speaketh
[25:48] unto
[25:49] me the one that's made me all of these
[25:52] promises you'll be with me did become
[25:56] come to a point that he was was
[25:57] beginning to get a little settled I
[25:59] guess in his experience but then when he
[26:01] wrestled with the angel of the Lord all
[26:04] night and what that means I don't
[26:07] understand cuz I don't think it was a
[26:09] physical wrestling you know I never have
[26:12] thought that that they and I there and
[26:13] fult with each other all night maybe you
[26:15] think that but I don't I think it was
[26:18] more of a forgive me for lack of words
[26:21] it was more of a um mental
[26:24] condition of existence within his being
[26:28] you know that he he was holding
[26:32] on within his own personal experience in
[26:35] other words he kept on maybe reminding
[26:37] that
[26:38] angel I believe you're from God and I'm
[26:41] not going to let you go until you bless
[26:45] me all right but see now when he got his
[26:48] experience of getting his name
[26:51] changed right now that was assurity that
[26:56] God was with him
[26:58] right and you'll find out really if you
[27:00] go through there and read it CU that's
[27:01] what I've been doing since I've had some
[27:03] time is reading through Genesis reading
[27:05] in in in the Kings and the different
[27:09] things and you know not having to think
[27:11] of things but things come to you and you
[27:14] know that it finally come in in Jacob's
[27:17] life that God had to come back down
[27:19] again and tell him that his name has
[27:20] changed yes if you'll study it even
[27:24] though he could say it been changed God
[27:25] come again and reminded it
[27:28] all right now that's the point I want me
[27:30] and you to think
[27:32] about we've had many
[27:34] experiences many things in our lives yes
[27:38] you know to talk about
[27:41] right
[27:43] but have we had an experience that we
[27:47] can put a life on
[27:52] right now I know you're not going to
[27:54] like this and those the people out there
[27:55] not going to like it but I just still
[27:58] tell it like it
[27:59] is my experience of coming into this
[28:03] message is not what I'm tying my
[28:06] experience
[28:09] to my experience was the day I received
[28:11] the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen that
[28:14] happened after I come into this
[28:16] message it wouldn't coming into this
[28:18] message do I anchor all
[28:21] things that's what most people lay on
[28:24] right yes they lay on that they have the
[28:27] B ISM with the Holy Ghost why I believe
[28:29] the
[28:31] message then you can go back to what
[28:33] we're talking about this morning and get
[28:34] into those statements that are made a
[28:36] lot of times it shows we maybe don't
[28:38] believe the prophet's
[28:40] message
[28:42] but see I put my
[28:45] experience the true experience
[28:48] personally was the day I received the
[28:50] baptism of the Holy
[28:53] Ghost because you can know the message
[28:57] right you can study the message you
[29:00] could have ate and and and hunted and
[29:03] and had personal and you know encounters
[29:05] with brother brandom and personal
[29:07] interviews and things like that and
[29:10] people do that and a lot of times I've
[29:12] heard people say that I had an interview
[29:14] with brother brandom and he said so and
[29:17] so
[29:19] well maybe we might misunderstand what
[29:22] he's telling us too but
[29:25] anyhow my personal experience
[29:29] is the new
[29:30] birth all right now that's what I'm
[29:32] trying to Anchor it to I want you to see
[29:36] that should be your anchor right all
[29:38] right it's not whether you say I believe
[29:41] the message right the devil believes all
[29:43] the message that's right all right it's
[29:46] not how long you've been in the message
[29:49] and how much you studied it that's right
[29:51] and everything else it's the personal
[29:53] experience of Jesus Christ within your
[29:56] heart all right
[29:58] now to show you kind of what I'm talking
[30:00] about see then we know that
[30:03] Peter referred to it one
[30:06] day and he said I was there on the
[30:11] mountain you know Peter James and John
[30:14] take it up into the mountain with Jesus
[30:15] you know and said I was up there and I
[30:18] saw these
[30:20] things but he said we have a more sure
[30:24] word yes of Prophecy yes right amen
[30:28] what's he talking about what is a more
[30:31] sure word of Prophecy than actually
[30:35] experiencing The Living Lord Jesus
[30:38] Christ that was there with him all the
[30:43] things they had went
[30:45] through in life and the doings what
[30:48] would be more real than that was the day
[30:51] he received the baptism of the Holy
[30:52] Ghost that's uh 1 Peter 1 1 one I think
[30:58] it's 19 or 1 n or whatever it is where
[31:02] he said said we have a more sure word of
[31:06] Prophecy something
[31:09] personal if the only way we'll ever see
[31:11] ourselves in the word that's right
[31:13] that's right is to first see Christ amen
[31:18] amen right that's we got to see Christ
[31:20] first that's right we see God first in
[31:23] the word that's right the people come in
[31:25] the message and say bless God I see
[31:26] myself
[31:28] and you know how I've always said it
[31:29] about people that do things people that
[31:31] come into the message fight and organize
[31:33] religion it won't be long they'll be
[31:36] leaving because they just find out
[31:38] there's as much organization around here
[31:40] as was back
[31:42] there but you see somebody come in and
[31:46] they get the revelation of one true and
[31:48] living
[31:50] God that person is more out to stay than
[31:54] the ones that see that it's organized
[31:55] religion was wrong am cuz they got
[31:58] something more that they can hang into
[32:00] the word right you know what what
[32:04] actually my wife and I talking about
[32:06] this the other night go down to brother
[32:08] Collins's what actually do you put it on
[32:11] that we're the
[32:13] bride we believe the
[32:16] message well now there's Millions around
[32:18] the world that are claiming this message
[32:20] that's
[32:22] right and there's all kind of doctrines
[32:24] and
[32:26] ideas that it went forth that's right
[32:29] from polygamy down to
[32:32] whatever of what we would say Believers
[32:35] of the
[32:37] message brother up here in the virgus or
[32:41] somewhere through that way he preaches
[32:43] that Jesus didn't have a physical
[32:45] Resurrection you know and he quotes
[32:49] brother brand more than I
[32:52] do you know as far as verbatim in a
[32:55] sermon all right but do we really
[32:57] believe it or has it been a personal
[33:06] experience is your experience real
[33:09] enough that you'd face
[33:12] Esau cuz that's where we're close to
[33:15] amen we're close to facing situations
[33:18] that could be and I've never been a
[33:20] doomsday style or do this I've just
[33:22] always said like I believe you know Let
[33:24] it go the prophet said they'd be persec
[33:27] come not tribulation now cuz we don't go
[33:29] through the
[33:31] tribulation but he said people could be
[33:33] shot on the
[33:34] spot well you're beginning to see those
[33:37] things take place yes is our faith going
[33:41] to hold us
[33:45] yes that's right Jacob had enough faith
[33:48] that he could turn around and start
[33:50] going
[33:52] home and he had enough believing that he
[33:55] thought he might be able to appease his
[33:57] brother by giving him all the things he
[33:59] had he finally sends him his family yes
[34:04] and thinking that he might look at them
[34:06] and see the descendants of Jacob and
[34:09] feel bad you
[34:12] know but that wouldn't
[34:15] enough but when he wrestled with the
[34:17] Lord and come through right he was
[34:21] limping when he left her that's right
[34:23] the rest of his life he was a limping
[34:25] Prince that's right and
[34:28] but he was a prince amen he was willing
[34:31] to go face his
[34:33] brother no matter what it meant as I
[34:35] said a moment ago if God had not have
[34:37] stepped on the scene Esau would have
[34:40] surely killed him that's right amen but
[34:42] God knew what he was going to do right
[34:45] but he let Jacob go through it that's
[34:47] right look like Jacob would have seen it
[34:50] when he says God says Jacob go
[34:54] home well probably Jacob in his mind was
[34:56] was thinking you know I I believe that
[34:59] was the Lord that told me that but said
[35:02] Lord are you sending me back to die you
[35:05] know are you sending me there to give my
[35:09] life and then he would meet him and have
[35:11] different things and and the Lord would
[35:13] bless
[35:14] him but yet he's still not certain of
[35:16] where he's
[35:18] at but one day he became real certain to
[35:22] him now anybody in the Bible that ever
[35:27] amounted to anything had a personal
[35:30] experience am with God
[35:35] Amen now I said about Peter said we have
[35:37] a more sure word of Prophecy even coming
[35:39] into the New Testament all
[35:41] right but you know you could take and
[35:46] spend years preaching this thought
[35:50] because you could start and take every
[35:53] profit and every profit if you'll get in
[35:56] there and readed every prophet in the
[35:59] Bible no matter if it was Micah and the
[36:01] little prophets you know whatever it was
[36:05] every prophet in the Bible had a
[36:07] personal
[36:10] experience
[36:12] right
[36:14] now one time I remember brother Brown
[36:17] talked about a prophet and the way he
[36:18] dealt was that he
[36:22] uh you know he spoke of his own life
[36:27] and God dealing with him all right but I
[36:30] looked this one up and I found one go
[36:32] ahead number one
[36:35] brother the message called preparation
[36:38] 1953
[36:42] 1111 says now SE her notice what he
[36:45] saying now word a vision Prophet you
[36:48] know now SE her a vision SE or a prophet
[36:54] whatever you want to call it a prophet
[36:56] is is a compound
[36:59] word just like sanctification is a
[37:01] compound word been cleansed and set
[37:03] aside there's many words and especially
[37:05] in our English words are compound now
[37:08] watch what he's getting at but a prophit
[37:11] means to give a personal
[37:15] experience under
[37:18] inspiration or foresee
[37:22] something now you get what I'm saying
[37:24] now every Prophet had a personal
[37:27] experience all the prophets were told to
[37:30] go and deliver the message right Jonah
[37:33] go down to
[37:35] Nineveh every Prophet you could cover it
[37:38] of each one of them lives and each one
[37:41] of them would wind up being to what he
[37:43] says now a prophet means to give a
[37:46] personal
[37:47] experience under
[37:51] inspiration or to foresee
[37:54] something he's a seer he's a
[37:58] prophet some of them dealt with visions
[38:02] right right y God would appear in Vision
[38:05] but some the scripture would say and the
[38:09] the word of the
[38:11] Lord came to Samuel
[38:15] maybe it's not an A
[38:17] Vision but it was a personal
[38:21] experience that the individual has if
[38:24] you ever trying to find and to and to to
[38:27] you know the people of this message and
[38:28] all they don't follow these things too
[38:31] closely but if I was looking to find a
[38:34] prophet in this day in the 54 Ministry
[38:36] I'm not looking for another one you know
[38:38] but I'm looking for in the 54 Ministry
[38:40] to be here all right everybody
[38:42] understand that not another Pro major
[38:44] prophet but fivefold Ministry Prophet
[38:46] but if I was looking and you told me so
[38:49] well brother Dale I believe this is a
[38:51] fivefold Ministry
[38:54] Prophet what I would do say I would
[38:57] listen to him very
[39:00] carefully and listen to him expressing
[39:03] his
[39:04] own way of seeing things or
[39:08] whatever but it always be listening to
[39:10] see if he was on the
[39:13] word and be keeping my eyes upon the
[39:16] word right because then I would remember
[39:20] that every Prophet brother randam said
[39:23] would
[39:24] always compare what he was seeing with
[39:28] the prophet
[39:29] previous to him amen see that way it
[39:32] becomes the Bible becomes the words of
[39:35] the Prophet yes right and we know the
[39:38] prophet is almighty
[39:39] God those men were not the prophets they
[39:43] were men with gifts given but the
[39:46] prophet was the god inside of them
[39:49] that's right and it was always a
[39:50] personal experience right right that's
[39:54] why I emphasize Jacob and I emphasized
[39:56] you know that the Lord spoke to
[40:01] him the god of Abraham the god of Jacob
[40:03] is fine but the Lord spoke to him now
[40:08] the Bible says if a prophet speaks
[40:11] presumptuously all
[40:13] right now you're supposed to really take
[40:15] them out kill them y you all right you
[40:19] see the people in this message saying
[40:22] that the Lord told me
[40:25] this
[40:27] this is what the prophet was talking
[40:28] about or some that are so dumb now to
[40:32] say the prophet didn't know how to say
[40:34] it but I know how to put it tell to you
[40:35] you know I know how
[40:37] to I can tell you where he made his
[40:39] mistakes and and all the things that he
[40:42] done and stuff like that you know but
[40:45] see a prophet now is someone who has a
[40:48] personal experience yes right and then
[40:51] expresses from his heart amen what he
[40:54] sees like uh naming non saying chariots
[40:58] Jing in the streets now he didn't say
[41:00] jicks and old mobiles running together
[41:02] here on the highway with headlights
[41:04] on but once the prophet brought that
[41:07] down into our
[41:09] language that was what he was seeing but
[41:12] what did he describe it as he described
[41:15] it as chariots cuz it's the only word he
[41:18] had running like lightning other words
[41:21] had lanterns hanging on you know uh who
[41:25] is Ezekiel
[41:27] Ezekiel Saw like fire falling I believe
[41:30] was all out of
[41:32] Heaven saw nuclear bombs and things
[41:35] probably but how could he describe it he
[41:38] put it in his own terms right right now
[41:43] listen to what I'm
[41:45] saying the god that told
[41:48] Mah and showed him what he
[41:53] saw is is our God not capable of being a
[41:56] able to write down Buick and O mobile
[41:57] running together in the
[42:00] street now come on
[42:03] right why didn't God choose to do it
[42:06] that
[42:10] way why is it that God didn't
[42:15] say Eve had relationship with the
[42:23] Beast could he not have written it
[42:29] yep could not Ezekiel say I saw an Adam
[42:32] Bomb fall out of an airplane and it
[42:34] blasted and you went all the fire or
[42:36] something like
[42:40] that what you see would if we had all
[42:43] those answers it wouldn't be no mystery
[42:47] right right that's
[42:50] right and then if you done that then you
[42:52] would have to write in the Book of
[42:54] Revelation come on
[42:56] you have to write the Book of
[42:57] Revelations there a little church up at
[42:59] Lula
[43:02] Georgia come
[43:05] on and they got you know 100 people
[43:12] there and they are the thing they spoken
[43:15] of in Revelations
[43:17] 5 amen see God doesn't do it that way
[43:21] does
[43:23] he so then each prophet
[43:27] only saw what God wanted s for the time
[43:31] right right
[43:33] okay and even coming down to the New
[43:36] Testament and the Apostle
[43:40] Paul Paul could say we're changed in a
[43:42] moment a twinkling eye don't you think
[43:44] he looked over and saw
[43:46] that but why didn't he say a little
[43:48] church up in Lula Georgia
[43:50] you you don't think he could have said
[43:53] it you don't think God could have said
[43:55] that then something wrong with your
[43:58] mentality but see it wouldn't have been
[44:00] a mystery that's right that's right it
[44:03] wouldn't have been a secret that's
[44:06] right see and then if it said that way
[44:09] you know what come
[44:12] on if it was said that way in the Bible
[44:15] then Lula wouldn't hold the people
[44:17] that's right I'm not a whole city amen
[44:21] right look on it said we got to be
[44:24] there because that what people's done in
[44:26] this message right A lot of them moved
[44:29] to jville a lot of when R around and
[44:32] went to Arizona a lot of them moved to
[44:34] Arizona that's right brother because
[44:37] they thought that's what it was supposed
[44:39] to
[44:42] be but you see God doesn't leave do it
[44:45] that
[44:48] way he leaves it to
[44:51] work that to me now this is the way I
[44:54] look at it that they would be a a
[44:56] Prophet come in the last
[44:59] days and that Prophet would not only be
[45:02] a seer of Visions seeing visions Etc
[45:06] foretelling things and the word of the
[45:08] Lord coming to him but he would be a
[45:11] born again
[45:13] believer you place brother random in the
[45:15] correct order bud you got something he
[45:18] wasn't just a prophet that got the word
[45:20] stalked out of the Wilderness and went
[45:22] back up in the mountain
[45:24] right
[45:26] he was a new testament Prophet I've
[45:28] heard that talked about and a lot of
[45:29] people you know the brothers not far
[45:31] from here believe that brother Randon
[45:33] was an old old testament prophet in the
[45:35] New Testament age well all they could
[45:37] teach was law they don't even realize
[45:41] it cuz that's what the the Old Testament
[45:43] prophets the only thing they could bring
[45:45] was the law right and speak according to
[45:48] the law that's right but you see he was
[45:52] a born again
[45:53] believer all right now not only that I
[45:56] believe he was an adopted manifested son
[45:58] of
[46:00] God put into the position of adoption
[46:04] right all right now in doing that look
[46:06] at the great position he was put
[46:10] in now that's only man in the Bible is
[46:12] putting that
[46:15] place even though Paul come on Paul was
[46:19] a
[46:21] prophet I agree with that you know a lot
[46:23] of people argue that say Paul wasn't a
[46:25] prophet
[46:27] but brother R said he was right all
[46:30] right now but brother Ram didn't say he
[46:33] was Miki 4 that's right he was not that
[46:36] kind right he was not written in the in
[46:39] the Bible
[46:41] that you know and you say well it is
[46:43] because of this that the other but it's
[46:45] not written in the Bible that a great
[46:46] man by the name of Paul is going to
[46:48] raise up and go forth as the first
[46:51] church age Messenger right that was
[46:54] written after Paul had done passed on
[46:58] but you see in what we believe this
[47:01] Prophet that we talk
[47:04] about was shown in the Bible
[47:08] amen Revelation 10:7 Luke 17:30 malach
[47:13] 4 shown in the Bible as to be
[47:16] coming then this Prophet could take all
[47:20] and you you'll get this when we come
[47:22] back to it later in Revelations 5 so
[47:26] study Revelations
[47:28] 5 and you'll see that this Prophet then
[47:32] could take the
[47:35] scripture and
[47:38] not interpret it by some of his own
[47:42] thoughts that's right but he could tell
[47:45] us what all of the
[47:49] prophets see when he would come forth
[47:51] and say look Malachi 4 says this and
[47:54] this and this and this right he is
[47:56] backgrounding do you understand yes he's
[47:59] got every
[48:01] Prophet that was prior to
[48:04] him that would be holler an amen to this
[48:08] man's
[48:09] message right because he would be
[48:13] describing what those prophets could not
[48:15] see yes he would be seeing chariots
[48:18] josing in the street and call them bu
[48:20] and O
[48:21] mobiles He Could See Fire Fall Out of
[48:24] Heaven as nuclear destructions
[48:27] Etc and in doing all of that he could
[48:30] break it down to you and
[48:32] I why because he had a personal
[48:35] experience
[48:37] yes something he could put everything
[48:42] on ain't that something the seventh
[48:44] grade education man is that embarrassing
[48:48] if you think I'm not
[48:50] right come on
[48:52] up and bring your Bible and come s with
[48:58] me he knew where he stood didn't he
[49:03] amen he not only knew where he stood he
[49:06] knew whereever Prophet
[49:09] stood now we think it it's a great thing
[49:12] that the prophet
[49:14] Moses that God could come down and he
[49:16] could write five books and he could
[49:19] actually write what happened in
[49:24] Genesis he could WR all of them
[49:27] things sure some of it by that time
[49:30] would have been
[49:31] CS cuz there's a lot of places I
[49:33] remember not too long ago we was all
[49:35] talking about it or something about the
[49:37] people that in Ser tribes you know their
[49:39] their business is to hand to keep the
[49:42] lineage you know and so you can go to
[49:44] them and they can tell you have lineage
[49:45] of everybody and everybody and everybody
[49:46] cuz that's what it's designed for you
[49:49] know but see this
[49:51] man wasn't just guessing at scriptures
[49:57] right this man's Prophet
[50:02] experience was to bring those
[50:06] scriptures and tell you what Isaiah said
[50:09] yes right in human
[50:13] terms to tell you what Micah
[50:19] saw I remember one time he said like
[50:22] this and I surely wish he'd went home
[50:23] but he said that a couple things he said
[50:26] one of them was that he said the one
[50:29] time he preached on on U Jacob no I'm
[50:34] not Jacob
[50:35] joob he said I preached 6 months me and
[50:38] brother Mo we we contacted everybody in
[50:39] the world we could find it thought we
[50:41] might be able get a hold those St I sure
[50:42] love to heard that wouldn't you you had
[50:45] him on the I heet for 6 months I'd love
[50:47] to heard that wouldn't
[50:49] you why because he was preaching
[50:52] something 6 months on a man on an ice
[50:55] Heat
[50:59] see he could see them
[51:03] things he not only seen it
[51:05] by by the writing of the
[51:09] word he he would see visions and things
[51:13] get on your uh what is it six seal I
[51:16] believe it's right now it's one in the
[51:18] seal book he said I I saw Moses walk out
[51:20] or something like that all right he was
[51:22] naming a prophet he said I've seen him
[51:24] walk out
[51:26] well see he wasn't just that wasn't just
[51:29] V
[51:31] jangling but he was telling baby he
[51:33] didn't see him walk out like
[51:37] that but he was telling it from his own
[51:42] experience right right something
[51:45] personal right amen that he could write
[51:48] the Bible right that's
[51:51] right but the problem was that people
[51:54] that wanted him to write the Bible was W
[51:56] him to add to it that's right right
[51:59] right well he couldn't add to
[52:02] it that's why when you look at my Bible
[52:05] and a lot of people when they look at it
[52:06] and see it they want to get
[52:08] it because 40 something years I've been
[52:11] wri down where brother explained
[52:15] that you know that's reason I don't like
[52:17] a new Bible but it takes me 3 months to
[52:21] copy all of those things the word
[52:24] brother around them explain that you
[52:26] know it tells you what that
[52:31] means now they've done a little bit of
[52:33] that back years ago and some of your
[52:36] know remember it they started out giving
[52:38] scriptures and you know and and they'
[52:40] show you around use this scripture well
[52:43] that was well and good but I like to
[52:45] write down what he
[52:48] said see because I
[52:50] believe that he brought from
[52:54] God
[52:55] the very you you different withen if you
[52:58] to okay I ain't talking about just a
[53:01] version of whatever you're talking about
[53:03] but brother R said this Bible as we have
[53:05] it today the thean and the
[53:07] butes own perfect
[53:12] place if there was ever a Bible before
[53:14] the world then this was the Bible that
[53:18] was before the
[53:19] world and the many other versions it
[53:21] doesn't
[53:23] compare to stay up then would not be it
[53:26] but they're part of it that's right cuz
[53:29] the King James version is actually a a a
[53:32] a compiling of many different
[53:38] versions that they took it and they put
[53:42] so many men in a room and they'd have to
[53:43] come out with the same thought upon that
[53:45] scripture before they would put it into
[53:47] what we call the King James
[53:49] version I read other versions I love to
[53:53] yes but my point
[53:56] is I believe we have the Bible
[53:59] correct why would I need other versions
[54:01] to explain it unless it's a breaking
[54:04] down of words you know expression of
[54:07] words all now but a prophet is one who
[54:11] has a personal
[54:13] experience and under that he
[54:16] foresees
[54:18] right and he can tell the very Mind Of
[54:23] God that's right
[54:27] and you would have to admit a lot of
[54:29] times we read your
[54:30] Bible and we don't see the mind of God
[54:34] right that's right but when the prophet
[54:37] comes along and tells you that right
[54:41] then you begin to say hey yeah I see it
[54:43] now yes well you know it didn't change
[54:46] the letters of the word that's
[54:48] right you
[54:51] know I know I've always been a St short
[54:54] thumb to a lot of people people but I
[54:55] know what that's what I talking about
[54:57] the people believe in 77 had to do that
[55:00] but you know the Bible said after 3
[55:05] days or in the third day right after two
[55:09] days or in the third
[55:12] day will you know we to believe that
[55:17] right but see if brother Brandon would
[55:19] have say
[55:20] it Rapture is not coming until after the
[55:23] year 2000
[55:26] you get my point or what
[55:29] yes hey we got made to 2,000 then we get
[55:34] ready cuz that's what people are
[55:38] saying and run around comes back in the
[55:40] tents and the things he'll tell us we're
[55:42] saved well then if that's got to be that
[55:44] we can't depend upon our own spiritual
[55:47] experience and there's something wrong
[55:48] with our we need a personal experience
[55:50] right right and see like me and P was
[55:54] talking about the other day
[55:56] brother random did say those things
[55:58] about
[56:00] 77 and I believe brother randam was
[56:02] looking for it to come before
[56:06] 77 cuz he was a human being right oh
[56:09] yeah but yet if you went back and asked
[56:12] him now he'd say but God told me to say
[56:15] that this way and that's the way I said
[56:21] it and then you can take it all and put
[56:23] it together and see
[56:25] that what he was saying was right all
[56:27] alone we misinterpreted that right to
[56:32] make him say what we think yes I
[56:35] remember a brother where the Bible was
[56:36] talking about there you know this
[56:38] generation shall not pass away and he
[56:39] said Israel went back to Homeland you
[56:41] know in 48 and this brother spent
[56:43] extensive time uh going over to Israel
[56:46] and things to find out that actually
[56:49] that the uh the charter what it was for
[56:52] Israel to become a nation was done in 46
[56:55] cuz see his point was he wanted to come
[56:56] a little quicker everybody else would
[56:58] say in 80 you
[57:00] know 88 or
[57:03] something he he done missed all these
[57:05] others he's wanting it to come a little
[57:06] quicker so he figured out 46 to 48 and
[57:09] then 40 years added to
[57:11] that but you see what I'm talking about
[57:14] church
[57:15] yes and we got something personal
[57:19] enough
[57:20] that it will hold
[57:23] yes
[57:26] so I believe this message is right
[57:29] yes now there statements brother Rand
[57:32] will make and things he'll say
[57:34] that these brothers are going out you
[57:36] know say brother around was wrong here
[57:38] he's wrong there well there was human
[57:40] erors and statements that he made he
[57:43] said thing because he was a human being
[57:45] that's right he said one day he said the
[57:47] blacks and waterfly again D life well
[57:51] that hasn't happened yet but it may
[57:52] happen one
[57:53] day
[57:58] do you see
[58:00] Church do we have a personal experience
[58:03] as
[58:05] it now brother Dick's always said this
[58:07] about it and I
[58:11] agree if they put out now that brother
[58:13] randam had 40 wives and they could
[58:16] produce all their names and all their
[58:17] kids and all their grandkids and the
[58:18] great- grandkids by
[58:20] now what would you
[58:23] say
[58:25] what happened when 77 went
[58:28] by people were sending their books back
[58:30] to Jeff and getting out of the
[58:32] message
[58:35] right we see that person didn't have a
[58:38] personal experience you say they ain't
[58:40] say I didn't we ain't talking about
[58:45] salvation I am but
[58:50] right I'm not throwing nobody out right
[58:53] they throw theel out
[58:56] they can always repent and come back to
[58:58] the truth
[59:01] right but you see what about a personal
[59:06] experience that you know come
[59:11] on what are you depend upon about this
[59:13] message brother R was Vindicated that's
[59:15] what most people say
[59:19] right am I true most people put it on
[59:22] the Bas to brother around was vated
[59:24] that's I agree with it I believe
[59:26] it but you know the Bible said if a man
[59:29] give you a sign and it come to
[59:37] pass but he takes you to another
[59:39] God not to believe him that's
[59:44] Bible yet we said when we father because
[59:47] he was
[59:51] Vindicated I I wasn't there to see the
[59:53] dead raising the sick heal was you now
[59:56] there's brother how back there and
[59:58] brother Gary Joy
[1:00:01] Charlotte anybody else I'm missing I
[1:00:03] always miss something when I try to call
[1:00:05] around the people that was dark they
[1:00:07] actually saw these things praise the
[1:00:09] lord we have witnesses Among Us that saw
[1:00:12] these things that's good all right you
[1:00:15] know I believe
[1:00:18] them
[1:00:20] all but you know that didn't save
[1:00:23] me
[1:00:25] brother around being a prophet didn't
[1:00:26] save
[1:00:31] me there's got to be a personal
[1:00:34] experience of something that you can
[1:00:37] depend upon that that in your life it
[1:00:39] can't be questioned that's
[1:00:45] right you say well well I I stay with it
[1:00:48] because brother Dale preaches it what if
[1:00:50] brother Dale back slides where you
[1:00:53] going
[1:00:56] come on I don't mind talking plain
[1:01:00] like I think it's time to be plain about
[1:01:02] it but I'm talking about a personal
[1:01:08] experience do you have a personal
[1:01:10] experience enough until they can't
[1:01:12] deprogram
[1:01:14] you that's what they do right they
[1:01:16] trying to do they take a people and they
[1:01:18] send them down to these places and they
[1:01:20] deprogram them where they talk them out
[1:01:22] of
[1:01:23] it how do they talk you out of they tell
[1:01:25] you all the fallacies all of the wrongs
[1:01:27] all of the people that done this and all
[1:01:28] the
[1:01:30] people they don't never tell you the
[1:01:32] group they come from and all they
[1:01:39] done around and said it come down the
[1:01:41] psychiatrist having to treat the
[1:01:42] psychiatrist you
[1:01:47] know but what if he found out brother R
[1:01:50] was wrong on
[1:01:53] something but well and I know this has
[1:01:55] been said cuz it was just recently on
[1:01:57] the internet
[1:01:58] thing brother brandom said if you ever
[1:02:01] catch me off the
[1:02:03] word I won't call who was a man that
[1:02:05] doesn't it but this man it wasn't on the
[1:02:07] internet it was a man that all of us
[1:02:09] knew he said brother Rand said if he
[1:02:11] ever called him off the word but then he
[1:02:14] missed it right
[1:02:17] here what the brother said you know what
[1:02:20] he done he left the
[1:02:23] message
[1:02:25] cuz he had one thing that he could see
[1:02:27] that thre around him he thought was
[1:02:31] wrong what about it what's your
[1:02:34] experience based on my wife my kids
[1:02:38] grandkids great grand what what's your
[1:02:40] experience based
[1:02:50] on you said but but you shouldn't talk
[1:02:53] about brother random could be wrong
[1:02:54] around with humans what I'm talking
[1:03:00] about that is a human he could do
[1:03:03] things see we want the super dupers we
[1:03:06] don't never want all the
[1:03:08] truth we want well bless God he seen
[1:03:10] that bull and he just said bull you go
[1:03:12] lay down that boy and lay
[1:03:14] down but you don't never hear people say
[1:03:17] that he said if I had my gun I would
[1:03:20] have killed the bull and went and paid
[1:03:22] for it yeah you don't hear that
[1:03:26] quoted that's in the same story right
[1:03:30] but you don't hear
[1:03:31] it see it's the super dupers that we
[1:03:34] want to
[1:03:35] hear because we're PR trying to prop up
[1:03:38] a super duper in our lives right and I'm
[1:03:41] not discounting your experiences I'm
[1:03:43] just saying what I've said about Jacob
[1:03:45] he had many many experiences of great
[1:03:48] things Moses had many
[1:03:52] experiences sure but when he met the
[1:03:55] Burning Bush brother Brandon said there
[1:03:57] in 5 minutes was better than all the 40
[1:04:02] years his mother and all the education
[1:04:04] he could have had to tell them who he
[1:04:06] was amen cuz he had something personal
[1:04:09] that's right amen I mean you want to
[1:04:11] pack up and go over to Russia and take
[1:04:13] over
[1:04:15] yeah come on you think about
[1:04:19] it the Man packs up and he heads down
[1:04:21] the
[1:04:23] road
[1:04:25] let me ask you something see if you see
[1:04:27] if you read your Bible or enough how
[1:04:29] many kids did Moses
[1:04:35] have who going to answer that
[1:04:43] two but you know he didn't have but one
[1:04:45] when he went to Egypt that's right you
[1:04:48] read your
[1:04:50] Bible but brother Rand will say Dar puts
[1:04:53] his kid on the hill other time he'll say
[1:04:55] they already had two
[1:05:03] kids zapor evidently got pregnant about
[1:05:06] the time that they got up to Egypt for
[1:05:08] Moses to deliver his
[1:05:10] message somewhere she
[1:05:13] did cuz when he went up there he only
[1:05:15] had one job that's
[1:05:19] right and read it read your Bible cuz it
[1:05:22] says in other words she goes home with
[1:05:25] What's
[1:05:26] um U what was
[1:05:29] Abraham's Granddaddy's
[1:05:32] name she goes home with
[1:05:35] him the number two child wasn't born in
[1:05:37] Egypt he was born over there you know
[1:05:40] when Moses leaves out and gets out of
[1:05:42] there his life didn't stay down in Egypt
[1:05:45] when all that was going on to deliver it
[1:05:47] she went back
[1:05:48] home and when you get over there he
[1:05:51] finds him and Moses has got two kids
[1:05:56] W you read your
[1:05:58] Bible then you don't argue about where
[1:06:00] brother Brandon was right or
[1:06:04] not you find out he knows what he's
[1:06:06] talking about Abraham I mean Moses had
[1:06:08] one child then Moses had two
[1:06:12] children and you find out how they got
[1:06:14] there that comes by reading your
[1:06:18] Bible you f
[1:06:23] g
[1:06:24] but listen
[1:06:27] Church you may have to read two or three
[1:06:29] chapters you may have to go from Kings
[1:06:32] over to the Leviticus I don't know what
[1:06:34] it what's the one word that they G from
[1:06:37] the Kings to
[1:06:38] the um chronic Chronicles all right you
[1:06:42] may have to go to Chronicles and read it
[1:06:45] right to find out what
[1:06:47] happened you'll find what is it in there
[1:06:49] in one of the scriptures is it Samuel or
[1:06:51] one other the the do and where where the
[1:06:58] David he has a man
[1:07:01] killed right then you got to turn over
[1:07:04] to the next one to find out
[1:07:06] why because that man touched and cut the
[1:07:10] head off of s of
[1:07:13] Saul and David had him killed but it's
[1:07:16] over in the next right it's not tiing
[1:07:20] that one where he tells about it Fe the
[1:07:24] Bible's got the answer if you understand
[1:07:26] what I'm saying those prophets would
[1:07:28] line up
[1:07:30] together now
[1:07:32] did don't be so carnal folks just just
[1:07:35] be honest and sensible now Isaiah didn't
[1:07:38] sit down and said well I wonder
[1:07:40] what let me get my computer and run up
[1:07:42] and see what David had to say let me get
[1:07:45] he may not have never read any of some
[1:07:47] of those right it was the Holy Spirit
[1:07:50] within the man that was lining up yes
[1:07:54] with all of the prophets and getting it
[1:07:56] straight that's right to where this
[1:07:59] Prophet could come and be a prophet with
[1:08:02] a personal experience right of the
[1:08:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost yes that those
[1:08:09] prophets back there could only have the
[1:08:11] anointing that's
[1:08:13] right and he could stand here and tell
[1:08:16] us what happened in
[1:08:21] Genesis name those people or whatever
[1:08:27] I remember the first time I heard him he
[1:08:28] said look there it it eeve said what did
[1:08:32] it say blonded and
[1:08:33] blueeyed I know he said blonde
[1:08:36] headed now where'd he get that
[1:08:39] from I just lucky he
[1:08:42] is
[1:08:45] no see maybe he seen
[1:08:48] something right
[1:08:51] M but it's a personal experience in a
[1:08:55] man I know what I'm I'll try to just cut
[1:08:58] this short go on but see you say that my
[1:09:02] pastor said so and so that's
[1:09:06] good brother rown said so and so that's
[1:09:12] good but is the holy spirit has it ever
[1:09:15] spoke to you come on about
[1:09:18] that now just remember there's a lot
[1:09:21] around the message that has said the
[1:09:23] holy Spirit spoke to them told him
[1:09:25] brother R was
[1:09:26] wrong now I don't I don't go along that
[1:09:29] okay I don't lay down my backgr of where
[1:09:32] he come from and why he would be the man
[1:09:34] and what is doing and laid it down I
[1:09:36] think through the Bible enough us to see
[1:09:38] it you know
[1:09:40] right all
[1:09:42] right see people say the Lord told me
[1:09:46] this right in the Bible times if a a
[1:09:49] Bible got person got up prophesied
[1:09:51] something didn't come to fight mom and
[1:09:53] dad take him out killed
[1:09:55] him yeah well we call
[1:09:59] Brothers
[1:10:01] right we call them all
[1:10:03] Brothers you that's brother so and so
[1:10:05] he's been the message law he heard the
[1:10:07] prophet now we got we got to and the
[1:10:08] prophet like I heard one one brother
[1:10:10] that he went out and done a bunch of
[1:10:11] thing wrong and this brother let him
[1:10:12] preach cuz he said the prophet ordained
[1:10:14] him how can I say he can't preach well I
[1:10:16] tell he ain't going to preach my f i
[1:10:18] don't care if he preaching in the
[1:10:20] world but I tell you ain't going to
[1:10:22] preach here
[1:10:25] see because that's my personal
[1:10:28] experience because we all got to have
[1:10:31] that now you you following
[1:10:37] me see see your mother's right your
[1:10:39] pastor
[1:10:43] right the Bible says no man can call
[1:10:46] Jesus say Jesus is the Christ only by
[1:10:49] the Holy Ghost amen now watch it this is
[1:10:52] a message of witnesses is recing Phoenix
[1:10:56] the Holy Ghost has to address it to you
[1:10:59] I mean excuse me has to witness it to
[1:11:03] you must be a personal
[1:11:07] experience now you see what he's talking
[1:11:09] about and all that he's given all of the
[1:11:11] years see maybe your mother maybe the
[1:11:14] things but you see why all the emphasis
[1:11:17] is always been made and he'll say well
[1:11:18] you know your pastor said he said
[1:11:22] but no man can call Jesus the Christ Yes
[1:11:26] except by a personal experience number
[1:11:28] three brothers go ahead personal
[1:11:30] experience with God preaching
[1:11:33] 54 paragraph
[1:11:35] e13 he talking about Moses had a
[1:11:37] personal experience he said that's what
[1:11:39] the church needs tonight is just stop
[1:11:42] studying on much
[1:11:45] theology
[1:11:47] listen it's just stop studying on so
[1:11:50] much Theology and get down to the altar
[1:11:53] and pray until a personal experience
[1:11:55] burns down into the human heart and
[1:11:58] burns out all the dullness and gives a
[1:12:01] gives a new vision amen then you got
[1:12:03] your Doctrine you got your theology fine
[1:12:07] why because you're dealing with it
[1:12:09] personal experience with God also same
[1:12:11] e14 is right on down he's talking about
[1:12:16] Moses he talking about the Holy Spirit
[1:12:18] coming down on the apostles who said
[1:12:20] such as I have that's what we need to
[1:12:23] Den not an experience personal with God
[1:12:26] Moses got the personal experience now
[1:12:28] watch Faith jump in what's the
[1:12:32] difference in Moses now away he goes to
[1:12:35] Egypt a oneman Invasion going down to
[1:12:37] take over nothing in his hand but a dry
[1:12:40] stick but he went down to do it and
[1:12:42] accomplished what God told him to
[1:12:45] because he had a fresh vision from God
[1:12:50] Amen if anything the church needs
[1:12:53] tonight
[1:12:54] and what we're trying to do friends is
[1:12:57] to bring a fresh vision from the
[1:12:59] presence of God now listen to it to let
[1:13:02] the people see that God still lives and
[1:13:06] Reign and moving with his church and he
[1:13:10] will until Jesus comes to receive it a
[1:13:14] vision
[1:13:16] experience that's what we
[1:13:19] need see we need each one of us need a
[1:13:22] personal experience with God and a
[1:13:26] vision right of what God wants us to be
[1:13:31] amen and how to go out and live it
[1:13:34] before others and line up with it look
[1:13:35] at the next one Jubilee
[1:13:37] year 1954 paragraph 113 Christianity is
[1:13:42] longsuffering goodness meekness
[1:13:45] gentleness patience is that right Christ
[1:13:49] when he was reviled he reviled not again
[1:13:52] is that right Christian Christianity is
[1:13:54] the life that a man lives it's a
[1:13:57] personal
[1:14:00] experience personal
[1:14:03] experience power of the devil I never
[1:14:05] have heard that tape I want to get back
[1:14:07] and listen to that one day I never
[1:14:08] noticed the title of it the power of the
[1:14:09] devil preaches Chicago
[1:14:11] 1955
[1:14:13] 10:05 paragraph
[1:14:16] E8 Jesus said except a man be born again
[1:14:19] he cannot understand the kingdom of God
[1:14:22] there's no way of understanding until
[1:14:23] you are born again and then God reveals
[1:14:26] himself to you and then you know that
[1:14:29] you pass from Death un life because no
[1:14:31] man can call Jesus the Christ only by
[1:14:33] the Holy Spirit see the only way that
[1:14:36] you'll ever know that Jesus is the
[1:14:39] Christ is when the Holy Spirit
[1:14:40] personally witnesses to you that he is
[1:14:43] the resurrected Lord Jesus no matter
[1:14:46] what he would do what kind of signs what
[1:14:50] kind of Miracles you'll never know it
[1:14:52] until you're personal experience with
[1:14:56] God and he goes on to say you'll never
[1:14:58] know it until it's
[1:15:00] revealed never know it watch this
[1:15:03] one message call Faith 19th 57 12:29
[1:15:07] paragraph 45 how little it was for
[1:15:10] Abraham after he had endured as seeing
[1:15:13] him who was
[1:15:15] invisible now we quote that a lot
[1:15:18] done Abraham saw him Abraham doubted his
[1:15:22] doubt
[1:15:28] when he start explain that's when I left
[1:15:30] the prophecy how little it was for
[1:15:32] Abraham after he had endured as seeing
[1:15:35] him who was invisible after he had
[1:15:38] endured now after he met God and had an
[1:15:42] experience of talking face to face with
[1:15:46] God that he could call those things
[1:15:48] which were not as though they
[1:15:51] were wasn't there all of his life was it
[1:15:55] is after he had an experience
[1:15:59] right after he met God face to face he
[1:16:02] says for he had an experience he had
[1:16:04] talked to God face to face that's what
[1:16:06] we need is a personal experience with
[1:16:08] the Living God Amen all
[1:16:13] right contending for the faith
[1:16:17] 1956 Parra E7 or
[1:16:21] E7 he said the teachers he's explaining
[1:16:24] to a man you know about that the
[1:16:25] teachers hasn't been wrong but they just
[1:16:27] missed it look what he said but what is
[1:16:29] it said you'll never know Christ by
[1:16:32] theology you'll never know Christ by
[1:16:35] education you got to know Christ by
[1:16:38] personal experience to be born again of
[1:16:40] his spirit that comes down and CH
[1:16:42] changes your life and makes you a new
[1:16:44] creature in Christ Jesus that's what
[1:16:47] does the
[1:16:49] difference that's what makes the
[1:16:50] difference of you now that now that's
[1:16:53] the reason we have so many different
[1:16:55] denominations and theories and things
[1:16:57] drop down then now to be born means to
[1:17:00] be delivered from now unless you are
[1:17:03] delivered by the holy
[1:17:05] spirit in your life to a new creature in
[1:17:09] Christ now unless you are delivered by
[1:17:11] the holy spirit in your life to a new
[1:17:14] life in Christ then our Creeds and
[1:17:16] things are no
[1:17:18] good watch but they're good you're all
[1:17:22] right
[1:17:24] there are moral teachings and so
[1:17:28] forth it's
[1:17:30] okay doctrines and teachings so it's
[1:17:34] moral
[1:17:36] teachings and that's fine which helps us
[1:17:40] but the real person Christ
[1:17:43] Jesus that's what was has made the
[1:17:46] meetings what it has been today and swep
[1:17:50] around the world is because by the grace
[1:17:52] of God to introduce to the large of our
[1:17:56] small crowds a
[1:17:58] resurrected Lord Jesus listen right now
[1:18:03] present tense in the same power that he
[1:18:07] ever
[1:18:08] was we don't have to guess about
[1:18:13] it that's what the message that's why
[1:18:16] the Divine Healing had to go forth
[1:18:19] that's why there had to be a healing
[1:18:20] campaign to show that there was a god
[1:18:23] that
[1:18:24] lived and the resurrection was real we
[1:18:27] heard the resurrection story right yes
[1:18:29] coming up Easter everybody preached on
[1:18:31] Easter Resurrection you know they preach
[1:18:32] this
[1:18:34] you and they preach he is risen you know
[1:18:37] and they get away from it he was risen
[1:18:39] and get out to he is risen and oh
[1:18:41] everybody thinks they really know what
[1:18:42] to talk
[1:18:43] about and that's good moral
[1:18:47] teaching
[1:18:48] right good moral
[1:18:51] teaching need to be taught yes well what
[1:18:55] about the person experience come on
[1:18:57] right have you experienced the
[1:18:59] resurrection or is it just
[1:19:02] words watch what he says but from the
[1:19:05] beginning it wasn't so
[1:19:07] 1958 paragraph
[1:19:09] e48 you say then these signs follow them
[1:19:14] he's a good old man he pays his tithe he
[1:19:17] works good he treats his neighbor right
[1:19:21] if that's all it took
[1:19:23] look Christ didn't have to die
[1:19:27] right it takes a personal experience of
[1:19:30] passing from death into life and
[1:19:32] becoming a new creature in Christ Jesus
[1:19:35] which is in the heart that's the Holy
[1:19:37] Spirit that's where it
[1:19:39] begins look at the next one it is I
[1:19:41] preach
[1:19:42] 1960 E15 I think every person that goes
[1:19:46] out to preach the gospel should never go
[1:19:49] until they have a personal experience of
[1:19:52] the B baptism of the Holy Ghost now one
[1:19:54] time he said meet God on the back side
[1:19:56] of the desert like Moses did well okay
[1:19:58] we all got to go to Egypt whever where
[1:20:00] to Backside the
[1:20:01] desert now that's not what he's talking
[1:20:03] about right a personal experience right
[1:20:08] right I believe that that was the
[1:20:10] qualification that Jesus gave them turn
[1:20:13] to seity of Jerusalem until your end
[1:20:14] with power on high then you shall be my
[1:20:16] witness in Jerusalem Judea Samaria fre
[1:20:19] Port Louisiana as it would read like
[1:20:21] that I hope that don't sound back
[1:20:23] religious but you know what I mean by it
[1:20:25] no person no matter how well you're
[1:20:27] educated how smart you are in the Bible
[1:20:29] the devil's twice as smart as you are
[1:20:32] yes sir he could twist it and make you
[1:20:34] look like Ned in the first
[1:20:37] reader some of us remember that right
[1:20:41] right oh your older one don't know what
[1:20:43] n in the first reader
[1:20:48] talking you never went to school when
[1:20:50] they said See Spot run See Spot Run Spot
[1:20:56] Run
[1:20:58] see week after week after year after
[1:21:01] year you finished the first grade you
[1:21:03] got out of net in the first
[1:21:05] reader you got in spot the second
[1:21:09] reader but now listen no matter how much
[1:21:13] you're educated what's going
[1:21:15] on listen to what he says here on
[1:21:17] presuming 62 117 there's only one Creed
[1:21:21] in the Bible who then we I don't Creed
[1:21:23] yes we
[1:21:26] do right no Creed but Christ oh no Creed
[1:21:31] but Christ so there's only one Creed in
[1:21:32] the Bible
[1:21:34] Christ come
[1:21:36] on are you listening yes we said we
[1:21:39] don't have no Creed brother R said
[1:21:40] there's only one Creed that's
[1:21:44] Christ in a personal experience he's not
[1:21:46] a Creed he's a living reality right amen
[1:21:50] see we only have to to know him is to
[1:21:53] know is to have
[1:21:56] life outside of that there is no way to
[1:21:59] life outside of knowing Christ by
[1:22:02] personal experience with him not by
[1:22:05] joining a church or reciting a
[1:22:07] Creed and when you only bring it to that
[1:22:11] shallow condition now listen to what he
[1:22:14] said when you only bring it to that
[1:22:16] shall of a
[1:22:18] condition can I paraphrase it to know
[1:22:20] the message of the hour to believe
[1:22:22] brother around was a prophet to believe
[1:22:24] all these things is a shallow
[1:22:29] condition come
[1:22:32] on that's why we have drunken New Year's
[1:22:36] parties by Christian so-called that's
[1:22:39] why we have celebration of Christmas and
[1:22:41] New Years and other holy days and so
[1:22:44] forth next one what shall I do with
[1:22:46] Jesus called Christ 63 11:24 paragraph
[1:22:50] 185 how the church ought to be checked
[1:22:52] it again and again and again and again
[1:22:56] we're waiting for his
[1:22:58] coming we're
[1:23:00] waking we're waiting for the
[1:23:03] takeoff we better check it with the word
[1:23:06] now what not what somebody said be sure
[1:23:09] you know yourself as a personal
[1:23:10] experience with Christ check it again
[1:23:12] and again and
[1:23:14] again why because we got the blood of
[1:23:17] Jesus Christ in our
[1:23:18] hands all right one more the T in church
[1:23:23] age with church age book
[1:23:25] 239 now I want to read the scripture
[1:23:28] here then read what he said Ephesians
[1:23:31] 3:16 that he would Grant you according
[1:23:34] to the riches of his glory to be
[1:23:36] strengthened with the might by his
[1:23:39] spirit in the inner man that Christ May
[1:23:41] dwell in your hearts by faith that ye
[1:23:44] being rooted and grounded in love may be
[1:23:48] able to comprehend with All Saints what
[1:23:50] is a breath and length and depth and
[1:23:53] height and to know the love of Christ
[1:23:56] which passes knowledge that you might be
[1:23:59] filled with all the fullness of God now
[1:24:02] look what he says now according to these
[1:24:07] verses when a man experiences the depth
[1:24:10] of God in his
[1:24:14] life it is an actual personal experience
[1:24:19] of the spirit of God indwelling him in
[1:24:21] his mind is
[1:24:23] illuminated by the wisdom and knowledge
[1:24:26] of God through the word
[1:24:31] amen through the revealed word
[1:24:34] right a personal
[1:24:37] experience but when your experience hold
[1:24:40] you that's all the master if it won't
[1:24:42] get one it
[1:24:46] will they put the gun to your head one
[1:24:48] day might change a lot of
[1:24:51] things you
[1:24:53] know but one you got to wait for the gun
[1:24:55] to be put
[1:25:01] there why can't we say that God is one
[1:25:04] that's holding us
[1:25:06] amen my personal experience of the
[1:25:09] baptism of the Holy
[1:25:11] Ghost the new birth in
[1:25:13] 1969 is what I'm talking
[1:25:16] about from there can be a growth
[1:25:19] development in your new birth
[1:25:24] through the knowledge and understanding
[1:25:25] of God's word that's why I read that
[1:25:28] lastely from that new birth that you
[1:25:32] received from there and from there only
[1:25:35] can the message become
[1:25:37] alive and yet I've read the message for
[1:25:40] two
[1:25:42] years before I ever receive the baptism
[1:25:45] of the Holy
[1:25:48] Ghost but see most people would and I've
[1:25:51] had one preacher sure he argued with he
[1:25:53] said what do you mean he said you
[1:25:54] believe the message didn't you bless you
[1:25:57] I said that don't mean I've got the new
[1:25:58] birth
[1:26:00] right that means I got a good head
[1:26:03] knowledge I've got the moral teachings
[1:26:05] of whatever right but I don't have an
[1:26:10] experience do you have an experience in
[1:26:12] your heart that'll hold
[1:26:20] you you know if we got an
[1:26:23] experience with God a real true one
[1:26:27] amen then a message like this morning
[1:26:30] won
[1:26:31] hurt it will help
[1:26:35] am if we had a personal experience amen
[1:26:40] if not our feelings are
[1:26:49] hurt a personal experience
[1:26:55] leading up to Matthew I mean to
[1:26:57] Revelations
[1:27:01] 5 we've got to be able to see
[1:27:04] ourselves in Revelations
[1:27:07] 5 where brother R said this is the
[1:27:10] actually the opening of those Seven
[1:27:14] Seals is the word he said in Revelations
[1:27:21] 5 I tried to say something years ago and
[1:27:24] theyd back away from
[1:27:25] it I'm come back to it I'm going to say
[1:27:29] it we've got to have a personal
[1:27:33] experience or else we will not fall in
[1:27:36] the truth right
[1:27:39] right you got all kind of doctrines that
[1:27:41] brother brandom open the seals and this
[1:27:44] happened or that happened Seven Seals
[1:27:46] not even open yet to say this is a they
[1:27:49] got all kind of
[1:27:51] doctr
[1:27:53] what's your personal
[1:27:57] experience I told you that they told me
[1:27:59] when I come in message during 67 you
[1:28:02] know begin reading in ' 66 and come on
[1:28:05] in '
[1:28:06] 67 they told me I couldn't be saved
[1:28:08] after
[1:28:11] 63 I said well I'm
[1:28:14] sorry I don't believe
[1:28:16] that you know if I believ that I'd have
[1:28:19] just set
[1:28:21] Downs I guess I missed
[1:28:24] it they say I can't be
[1:28:32] saved but you see I didn't care what to
[1:28:36] say I had experiences with God and
[1:28:39] you've heard me tell of
[1:28:42] them but you see I knew when I heard
[1:28:45] this message I did not have the new
[1:28:48] birth well how'd you know brother Dale
[1:28:50] because I seen a man talking about
[1:28:52] something that I know wasn't in my
[1:28:55] heart oh I had all of the moral
[1:29:00] teachings right
[1:29:04] yeah I saw a man talking about a God
[1:29:06] that I met when I was 11 years old and I
[1:29:08] just couldn't find no
[1:29:10] more you think I didn't want to follow
[1:29:12] that man that he talked about that talk
[1:29:14] about a god like
[1:29:16] that see what caught me I told you over
[1:29:19] and over what caught me of the message
[1:29:21] was the plain of the
[1:29:23] Prophet to be able to even tell us all
[1:29:26] of his problems right and the things of
[1:29:29] his life that had
[1:29:31] went and how that he tried to commit
[1:29:34] suicide on two different
[1:29:36] occasions
[1:29:38] amen all the things he had told
[1:29:42] us and I read one day where he said like
[1:29:44] this he said do you think them Pride
[1:29:47] Jews would have ever told about Abraham
[1:29:50] lying and giving his wife wife
[1:29:52] away and put it in the Bible you know
[1:29:55] it's in their Bible you know he said
[1:29:58] they wouldn't have done it but said God
[1:30:00] made them put it in
[1:30:04] there see they need told his problems
[1:30:06] and troubles I seen a man that was a
[1:30:09] human being amen but then all at once he
[1:30:13] would tell you what the Bible
[1:30:17] said and i' rejoice right I told you
[1:30:20] about it taking the Bible and and the
[1:30:22] prophet's message and laying down and
[1:30:24] saying God this man here even says that
[1:30:27] there'll be false prophets come in the
[1:30:29] last days what if he's one of
[1:30:35] them you know the Lord didn't spend no
[1:30:38] whole lot of time talking to me and
[1:30:40] telling me all about he's Vindicated or
[1:30:42] anything he
[1:30:43] done you know what he said and what does
[1:30:47] the Bible say right that's all the Lord
[1:30:51] ever spoke to me on on
[1:30:52] that two different occasions that's what
[1:30:55] he said than what does the Bible
[1:31:00] say you
[1:31:01] know and that was when I wasn't born
[1:31:08] again and see I've never claimed it then
[1:31:10] I didn't claim it until I saw what it
[1:31:12] was and then received
[1:31:17] it because it became a personal
[1:31:19] experience come on a personal
[1:31:23] experience with Jesus
[1:31:26] Christ to where then you don't mind
[1:31:29] talking to the
[1:31:30] world as they're out there listening
[1:31:33] some trying to catch you in your wording
[1:31:35] some trying to do all kind of
[1:31:39] things see I don't worry about
[1:31:42] it I just tell you what I believe the
[1:31:44] best I can I know I make human errors so
[1:31:47] forgive me out there and all like that I
