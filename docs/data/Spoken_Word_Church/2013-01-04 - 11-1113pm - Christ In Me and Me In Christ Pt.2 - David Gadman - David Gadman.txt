of my the eyes of my heart oh oh oh oh oh amen and turn in your bibles to saint john the 10th chapter hallelujah amen amen uh while you're standing we'll just uh read you another story this is kind of you might have heard this one before somebody said one time brother might have not mentioned this but called the last supper really the reason i'm reading this is you know you never know what you're going to end up or where you're going to be you say well i if i ever you know i don't have to serve god whatever but you don't ever know where you wind up you don't serve him hey man listen to this i thought this was amazing this is a replica of leonardo da vinci's painting of the last supper this famous masterpiece took over seven years to paint the interesting story behind the paint is that da vinci felt that he should use living persons as models since this was to be such an important picture he started with the painting of christ hundreds of young men were studied to find a man whose face portrayed innocence and beauty after long search he found a man whom he felt could portray christ the painting of christ took six months when christ was completed the vince he worked for six years painting the disciples until all were completed but one that one was judas to find someone whom they eventually thought looked like judas was a problem after a long discouraging search da vinci heard of a man in prison at rome who was sentenced to die for his brutal crimes leonardo went to rome as the prisoner was brought before him he saw a man with an ugly vicious face scarred and full of hate he knew immediately that this was the man he wanted to represent judas the savior's betrayer by special permission from the king the prisoner was brought to milo to pose for davinci for six months he set for davinci and appointed ours each day finally the gifted artist finishes his painting as the guards was taking the prisoner away he broke loose rushing to leonardo's leonardo's side he gaps look at me do you not know who i am with his sharp piercing eyes the bench he looked at the man and said no i do not know you i never saw you until you were brought before me in rome then the prisoner lifted up his head toward heaven and cried oh god have i fallen so low then he turned to da vinci said leonardo da vinci look at me again i'm the same man you painted only seven years ago as a figure of christ so i just thought that's real amazing you never know what you wind up amen if you ever get away from the lord and i sure don't want to get away from them in this late hour amen saint john's gospel the 10th chapter we want to look at this again excuse me christ in me and me in christ trust that everyone good afternoon and just can you pray for brother wade from sam services back home they ain't started yet but praying that they'll have a good time in the lord tonight john chapter 10 verse 21 let's just start at verse 25 again jesus answered them i told you and you believe me not the words that i do in my father's name they bear witness of me but you believe me not be because you are not of my sheep that's the reason they didn't believe him because they were known of his as i said unto you my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and i gave unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand i and my father are one that's just by our heads father we love you lord this afternoon father we just thank you for your grace and your mercy told us father i pray oh god that you just help us again tonight lord god as we endeavor to try to say something that would bless your people lord open the eyes of our heart once again lord god help us lord may the vessel just move aside father you speak tonight lord because that's what we come for we didn't come from here to to hear or be seen from anybody lord not even me lord god i'm just the vessel that you chose to use to like father i pray that i can move myself aside lord and heal myself to you and you just use my lips and speak to me lord god and anoint the hearts and ears of the listener that they'll be able to listen and receive what they have need of father for me being a man i know have no way of knowing what they have need of father but father you do lord and lord if they pull from the gift lord lord you can actually move me away from my notes and speak directly to somebody that's in need lord so we just ask lord that you do that tonight lord touch and heal touch and save lord and fill all with the holy ghost we ask these things in jesus name amen you may be seated read that again out of the amplified verse 27 and 28 and that's what i want to kind of deal with them a couple of uh uh scriptures there tonight again christ in me and me in christ amen i want to be in him like we said this morning we found out that they they did not believe because they were none of his and i sure want to be one of his tonight amen and amplified the 27th verse it reads like this the sheep that are my own hear and are listening to my voice hey amen i hope i'm one of his tonight if i'm one of his i'm i'm hearing and i'm listening to his his voice amen and i know them and they follow me verse 28 says like this and i give them eternal life and they shall never lose it or perish throughout the ages to all eternity they shall never by any means be destroyed and no one is able to snatch them out of my hand thank god for that now let me read you something that the prophet of god said and then we'll get right into this amen got a few scriptures i want to look at some quotes and just different things and so you just bear with me tonight this is what the prophet said it isn't because my mother there is saved that i'm saved it's because god chose me in christ amen that'll make a shout right there it isn't because my mama's safe tonight it isn't because my daddy's saved it isn't because i go to brother homer's church or or i knew the prophet i fished with him i hunted with him it isn't bad but it's because god chose me in christ hallelujah hey amen it isn't none of them but it's because he chose me in him amen he said i want you to see it now you too not you choosing yourself amen not me choosing myself right amen it wasn't that but it's not your choice amen not my choice amen not how much you prayed when you turned a new page you had nothing to do with it amen oh he said you had nothing to do with it god oh my when you get to see what's true you say you mean that i didn't turn to the lord no sir you had no way at all of turning to the lord your whole nature your whole makeup was against god amen my whole makeup my whole nature amen because me and you was actually born between satan and eve our nature we came to hear and the bible says we were born shaking iniquity come to the world speaking lies the first light we ever told was probably to get out of a whippet or something but hey our nature amen wasn't even for god amen but god knew that hey somewhere amen that he had like that little eagle story that the prophet of god talked about amen he said you had no way at all i turned to the lord your whole nature your whole makeup was against god god called you hallelujah i thank god for that tonight that he called me that he called you we are to be thankful to god for that tonight right right amen it always it's always been that way amen we're to be faithful to god tonight because of that amen we all stop right there and get on our faces before god say god i thank you tonight that you call me that i didn't have nothing to do with it nobody had but god you called me and you chose me and you right hallelujah amen it's just as a shepherd he protects his sheep jesus protects his people from harm amen we can expect as believers to suffer on earth meaning we can expect as believers we're going to suffer amen we're not exempt from those things amen satan can't harm their souls are taking away their eternal life with god amen he can't do that it's like job amen you know he has to play satan has to play by the rules of the game right amen amen you know the story there how that when he came the sons of men the sons of god came to brazil there and satan was right amongst them and god asked him to have you uh consider my servant job how did he say just man he's he he hates evil and he's a perfect man and there's none like him amen can you man i hope he says that about me tonight but there's none like him amen amen and open satan said well you got a head bit around let me just he said all right but don't take his life amen and all that the bible says that job never did charge god foolishly hey amen i mean you're not exempt from those things amen but i hope that mean you amen can have something like joe did that though all hell is raging against us amen we're going through hell in high water but we are still able to stand because it's christ in me and me in christ right amen amen oh we may have to suffer we may have to go on to all kinds i don't understand them things sometimes hey but we will have to we're not exempt amen he said there are many reasons to be afraid amen because this is the devil's hey man hey i get kind of scared every now and then hey man i get kind of afraid every now and then hey man when you look around you see that but cause this hey this is the devil's domain amen but we're trying but if we choose to follow jesus he gives us everlasting safety hallelujah amen and so that's why i want to stay in christ amen hello god help me this this night amen and not only tonight but every day i'm searching every day every second of the day every hour every minute of the day i'm searching i want to make sure that i'm in you and you and me all right right hey amen right i just wanna say well i go to brother sims church or amen i go to i listen to brother wade or amen i know all that i've heard all the traits i got all that don't mean nothing to god amen what means to god and then i've got i've been born again amen i got him on the inside right hey amen hallelujah amen now and they remained under his under the shepherd under his the shepherds care amen and you know that that person whoever it is that's that sheep me and your sheep amen we can uh if we remain under the shepherd's care that we we're going to derive and draw the very life from his provision amen and possession of what he has for us amen they have at their disposals all the resources amen then sheep amen under that shepherd whoever it was amen i read a book on some sheep amen and i'll i'll deal with that in a minute but they they every the shepherd and their sheep when they're under the shepherd's care they have everything they need at their disposal right and you know what it's a disgrace for a shepherd to lose one sheep come on can you imagine oh god hey amen it's a disgrace so every time every menu as sheep of his pasture as she from his foe we have at our disposal the word of god tonight amen they can provide for me and you amen they had all the resources amen of that ranch and then they was they was there at that ranch and that shepherd was a chef and had them sheep and they had everything at their disposal right amen they become they became his life and he became theirs yes sir i got an uncle and i met i asked my aunt one time this been several years ago i said what's he doing see he goes out there and saying what's he doing he said he's talking to him and they actually understand him amen that's a shepherd amen can you imagine hey what's about the great shepherd amen he talks to us amen and we can talk and he understands and he knows what you have needed right and he ever cares and protects us amen but from our heart oh we may suffer amen we may go through a spill or whatever but he takes care of us and we got everything at our disposal everything that we have to need in this last journey we got it at our disposal right yeah amen this man by the name of keller phillip keller he was raising sheep hey man so he made a statement like this one time as he was raising sheep he said now i got some sheep and i was raising them he said but i had one sheep amen that can always gave me a little trouble oh my and so this one sheep said he always wanted to get out of the fold he always thought the pastor looked greener on the other side and he was always trying to wandered out amen trying to and he never really was satisfied oh brothers and sisters today and they are that we're living in amen we need we find people today because why because they have not got christ in them and they are not in christ and they're so dissatisfied today right right hey amen i was teasing somebody the other day amen or just yesterday i said man y'all put out a good spread i said man this is real good so i'm gonna go back home and i'm gonna tell this is me well that's all i'm gonna tell brother homer that if you don't step it up a notch i'm gonna move my letter but i'm just saying but that's the way people are today ain't that anything they can knock amen why because they're so dissatisfied what is it it's a lack of christ in their life amen once we get christ in our lives and we're feeding off the holy spirit we should never become this satisfied amen hallelujah but you found that today that people are so dissatisfied amen and he said this sheep was never satisfied and he got out and once he got out he was exposed to the perils that would come his way amen he would or he would get lost or he would all pray to all sorts of disasters what about me and you hey man you find people like i said so dissatisfied why they need another dose at the altar it's what it is amen but they come so dissatisfied and they're wandering in and you know you get used to weathering in and out you know you can be in and outside in the congregation god help us that's why i want to search hey man my heart i want to search my life i don't want to make sure that he's number one hey man cause he's a jealous god hey man he wants to be number one hey man he won't play second fiddler nobody amen and i'm so glad that he's like that so i want to make sure hey god i want to make sure that i got everything that ain't nothing in front of you they ain't nothing else because if there's something if i put something else ahead of him that becomes an idol amen or i can put my car i can put brother homer come on church amen i can break brother bradley man amen brother brother didn't save me christ is the one me and it's gonna be christ in me the hope and glory and christ and me will make me love everybody alone christ in me will make me want to come to the house of god christ with me make me want to lift my hands and tell god how merciful and how great he is amen hallelujah in the same way with us amen as being the sheep of his pastor every man is being cheap hey man i'm saying god let me never hey man let me go get so wrapped up in you amen amen oh my we sing that song is he satisfied amen i wanted to be satisfied with me and i want to be satisfied with him hey man so i won't have to wander out and i want to look and say well that path that over there looks that pastor looks greener on the other side amen because if i get out and i get to wondering hey man i'll get i'll get messed up hey man i'll get out and i'll be i'll be exposed to all kinds of perils amen i'll be exposed to all kinds of things the devil wants to poke down me amen i'll get lo i'll be lost and off i'll pray to all sorts of disasters i don't want to do that tonight but i want to stay safely in the fold amen and the only way i can stay safely in the fold tonight is make sure this christ is in me and to be in christ all right amen let me read you something here real quick life is quite its correspondence between an organism and its environment and it see in its environment life goes on so long as the organism is deriving its nourishment from its surroundings all right now life is correspondence between our organism and its environment and life goes on so long as the organism is deriving its nourishment from its surroundings the instant it no longer draws its support from its environment life ceases at that point the organism is declared to be dead so what about it physically amen what about the environment around us physically amen oh god help me amen that i can draw my nourishment because hey if i don't i don't add physically if it stops doing that drawing it's nourishment from the surroundings and they better have good surroundings and he said at that point it's dead what about morley amen no wonder a lot of people they ain't drawing they ain't got a good environment and they ain't drawing from the resources and the best environment around the morally what about spiritually amen the same way amen oh my but we got substantiation and i looked at that word meaning supplying our being supplied with the necessities of life like food and water what about spiritually amen god can sustain us amen he gave us amen the greatest gay man thing that he could give us amen amen and that's eternal life amen and not only that but he made a provision for us amen he made a way of escape for us amen and not only that he's provided us the tools and the necessary means amen to feed this holy ghost on the inside of us amen that's up to me and you defeated amen amen hallelujah like i said this morning he said whatever whichever one i feed the most amen or i want to feed that holy ghost that word of god and so god amen he sustains us he gives us everything that we have need up on this last journey amen can you imagine he's giving us the bible and not only that hey man do you think just for a minute the bible said he didn't say it paul's thing but he said in this day in the days of the voice amen everyone just about that time that the prophet started going out the wire tape recorder came on right the scene hey man god knows just how to do everything that's right amen and so we didn't have to take it second-handed right hey man we can hear it for ourselves word for word the prophet even made mention when i'm long gone he said you young people can take it sit down in the cooler your room and listen to this and you can remember what i said you said hey i remember my brother random saying that and it's now coming to pass hallelujah and god has provided all this and he's made it even possible now we got it on mp3 ipods and all that hey if we if we could die and go to hell it's our own fault because god's given us everything that we have in life amen hallelujah hallelujah hey man i'm so glad for that tonight that he's giving us everything that we have need of such time amen i don't have to wonder i'm satisfied tonight hey amen now let me read you some scriptures here from there let's see what the prophet of god had to say we're trying to get on with this amen now i'm the first now i printed these out so if you want to just jot them down reading when you get home nahum 1 7 says the lord is good a stronghold in the day of trouble amen the lord is good i think i'll stand there at the closing of service today ain't god good to give us so many blessings undeserving that's what i am amen and we are to love him praise him amen amen a little bit more today and a whole lot more tomorrow amen because he's been so good to us he's been our mama he's been our daddy he's been our brother he's been our sister he's been so good so it's a stronghold in the day of trouble and he knoweth them there that trust in him thank you lord hallelujah amen saint john 6 64. for jesus knew that from the beginning who they were that believe not and who should betray him he knew from the beginning who they were that believe not and who should betray him he knows you who who you are tonight he knows what your attention are amen he knows who you are he knows if you believe in him tonight or not amen i may not know but he does amen second timothy 2 19 says it like this nevertheless the foundation of god standing sure having this seal the lord knoweth them that are his and let everyone that nameth the name of christ depart from iniquity amen the foundations of the lord standing sure hallelujah amen his word amen he built it on a solid rock and this mighty move of god amen in other words the church a little bit god is moving on right and the gates of hell are backing up because he told peter he said blessed art thou silent celebrate your flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you but my father which is in heaven and upon this rock what rock a revelation of who he was and not only who he was but what he was in the hour that peter was living in that's right and he said upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell cannot prevail in other words the gates of hell are going to be there but they cannot prevail against the church of the living god the church of the living god is moving forward and the gates of hell are backing up and we're moving forward in the name of the lord hallelujah amen standing sure amen hallelujah i want to be built on that foundation amen second timothy 1 12 says it like this for the which cause amen paul talking ain't telling timothy for the which cause i also suffered these things hey man i said i suffered a lot of things timothy but nevertheless i want you to know something i'm not ashamed amen oh i'm not ashamed tonight to declare that i follow a man by the name of william branham amen how he brought amen the message to us they meant to prepare a bride to get out of here right hey man all they got them books hey man i think it was tim lahaye wrote left behind what's that doing preparing those that's gonna be left behind but i got a message out amen that ain't not getting me prepared to be left behind but getting me prepared to get out of here hallelujah amen for this cause i also suffer these things nevertheless i'm not ashamed for i know in whom i have believed paul said i know in whom i have believed and am persuaded in other words i'm absolutely convinced i'm sure i'm steadfast right i'm unmovable right thank you lord hey amen i'm persuaded that he is able to keep that which i have committed unto him against that day right hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah now listen what the prophet said he said you bring a reproach upon the cause of christ isn't that right it ain't the bootlegger it ain't the prostitute amen ain't hurting a church those that profess god amen those that profess amen and don't live it amen that's the ones that hurts the church he said get away from sin oh we are so short brethren amen if he said that what about now amen god help me that's where i come to the house the bible that's why a lot of people don't want to come to the house of god because the scripture says judgment begins at the house of god and a lot of people don't want to come because i know if they come they're going to be judged amen god help us to be i want to be judged now and help me lord to judge myself now so that i can line up to your work so i won't be judged right hallelujah amen he said get away from sin oh we're so short brother one black she said we don't come to hear good music we don't come to hear a good singing but we come to find out what we're coming up short at right amen check up on our soul salvation take inventory hey man we need to do it every day all right every second of the day yes he said all of us we're short of what christ wants us to be that's right oh god help me then lord if i'm short of what you want me to be god help me lord help me to line up help me to take your word and embrace it lord oh god he said it's time to lay aside every weight amen he said even when death knocked it amen that's saint paul's heart door hey man he was he said what in this car he said i'm persuaded hey man i know whom i believe amen what do you say he said i fought a good fight and i kept the faith but then hey amen here's where they laid it for me to crown the glory amen not only me but those who are looking for his coming hallelujah he was persuaded amen he said if he sent you and you're sure of it you're going to achieve this the work that god he said if he sent you and you're sure of it you're you're going to achieve the work that god predestinated you to do you'll stand there and god and god will take every carnal impersonation away from you amen right stand there you can be you you can be persistent because you know who you have believed and what's right examine your revelation with the word if it's contrary leave it alone if it's with the word god's bound duty bound to keep his word amen his duty bound to keep his word so amen i want to check my revelation and if it's a mind up with a word that needs duty bound to help me and see me through hallelujah hallelujah amen glory god amen hallelujah look at john hey man like i said i'm just i'm just reading these and i can see you can look at them take a note on the reading when you get home hey man saint john 8 amen and uh 12. hey man it says it like this saint john 8 12 it says then speak jesus again unto them saying i'm the light of the world he that followed me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life hallelujah and again in saint matthew's gospel the 7th chapter in the 14th verse because straight is the gate and there is a way and amen which leads to them to lie and few there be that find it who am i now listen to what the prophet said he said that manifested out of the world amen is the bible jesus said he was the light of the world the bible said he is the word the vindicated scripture is the light amen so if we got the light in us then we're the vindicated scripture for this hour that we're living in all right listen he said see how perfectly the scripture is a day that won't be called day or night amen fruit can't rob it unless the sun ripens it no matter how how matter how much you preach whatever you do it can't be robin it can't be manifested it can't be vindicated only by him who said i am the light of the world the word the word so there has to come forth the power the holy spirit himself to robin are to vindicate our to our to prove or to make manifest that what he's predicted would happen in this day hallelujah hallelujah they eat their light predicts that or produces that hey amen so the light it's come and then it produced what it said it would produce it'll indicate what it said it would have been okay it'll manifest what it said it would be manifested right amen then we read in matthew 7 14 because straight as a gay this isn't what he said but you he said because straight as the gate narrows away and but few there will be that find it for as it was in the days of noah we're in eight souls we're saved so shall it be at the covenant of the son of man think of it what day are we living do you recognize the eye do you recognize today oh my god right he said do you recognize the eye right he recognizes today brother says we're living the light out right this is not few of them in in his day recognized him even knew him just very few never recognized him never knew him millions of people that knew nothing about it he said millions of people that never knew nothing about it he said street is a gate and there's the way just thinking of how many didn't recognize him didn't know he was that and then right around where he was at that's the pitiful part but they didn't recognize him what about today but they don't recognize the hour and the day they're living in amen when they see things come when they see the word of god being made manifest they still don't recognize amen they are and the day that they're living in god help me they meant to recognize my day and my heart that's why i want to be i want to re that's why i need to remain open to his will and say god help me oh my he said he'd give us eternal life he said he'd do that he said my sheep know my voice he said a stranger they won't follow he says they know my voice they're mine i'll keep them their fathers put them in my hand and no man can pluck them out amen oh saint john 1 12 says it like this but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believed on his thing see he came to his own the scripture says and his own received him not but as too many as received him to them gave he to who then that received him that he the power gave them the power to become the sons of god amen when he came he was expressed just exactly like the scripture said he wouldn't be expressed when all those who were redeemable believed it amen all those that were redeemable believed it amen because he said to them that received him gave he power to become the sons of god and the only ones that could receive him were those that were redeemable right oh my so he came and expressed just like the scripture says he would express amen then all those who were redeemable believed it because they were the thoughts of god the attributes of him at the beginning were made flesh and redeemable as brought back to god as many amen because they were redeemable thank god amen like i said this morning he had placed a deposit amen he put something in us these earthen vessels he put a deposit in this amen oh there's no deposit no return but he put a deposit in us amen i'm so glad amen that he put a deposit in us and because of that we'll return hallelujah amen thank you lord amen saint john 3 16 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not

believers amen as believers mean you're going to face hardships that's right like i said we're not exempt from those things all right sometimes you don't understand what some people have to go through and they may have to suffer and everything but we might have to hey he never did tell job what he was going through satan just came like i said this morning something just came before say hey and god said have you considered my sermon job that's right now he didn't write now i'll show you paper and facts drove a copy and said hey fix my tempo that meant because he did joel might have been on the hey look but he wanted to know he had confidence that job would not betray him that job oh he got down pretty low the bible says even curse the day was born hey man he said who am i but then one day he told joe he said you stand up like a man i want to talk to you said joe where war yet that's right hey man where were you at job hallelujah and joe said at the end he said my eyes i heard but now i see hallelujah hey amen oh we may have to face hardships amen i don't know how much we have to fake we're going to have to face before we get out of here but if he's in us and we're in him amen we can stand the test amen he's got he's got i believe he's got enough confidence in me and you and he's put a deposit in us that we're able to stand the test amen oh he had enough confidence in job amen oh when they came and ran and told job amen this has happened this has happened what did joe did he bowed his face to the other side blessed is the name of the lord the lord given to the lord taken away blessed be his holy name what about me amen when paul asked that question who shall be able to separate us when his wife came to say oh job you look awful why don't you curse god and god said you speak like a foolish woman all right amen right oh we may have to face hardships but we have a promise amen hey man sometimes and going through trials intestines it feels as though we've been abandoned but we've got a promise i have that little story when that man got out there and he wondered he looked back over his life and he said man lord i knew you was with me in the smooth places because i seen two sets of footprints but said well it got kind of hard only seeing one said he said that's when i picked you up in my arms and carried you oh i'm so glad every now and then he has to pick us up amen but he promised he'd never leave us he never forsake us he never abandoned us amen now let me just read you some things to the prophet of god said they weren't trying to get out of here hey man listen he's in the 12th chapter of first corinthians said by one spirit we're all baptized into one body and become members of that body and then it's not me it's not what i've done what i am who i was or nothing about it is what god has done for me in christ hallelujah it's what god has done for me in christ and we are perfected with our sacrifice he makes no mistakes he wouldn't bring you in if he wasn't worthy hallelujah he said he wouldn't bring you in if he wasn't worthy so tonight mean you amen he knows that me and you are worthy or he wouldn't bring a seat thank god thank god that he knows all about us right bless him i thank god that he knows about me amen amen he makes no mistakes he don't make no mistakes oh there's people holding mistakes in their arms today a lot of 16 15 16 year old girls are mistakes but men you are no mistake that's right he knows just about you hey man he knows just about he knows he said he makes no mistakes he wouldn't bring you in if he wasn't worthy he knows your heart that's right he knows what you are he knows your motives he knows he he said he knows what you are there's trout all along the road sure the devil will cause you to stumble and you say god i didn't mean to do that god you know it you're still per you're still perfect because there's a perfect blood offered for you every day and a bleeding sacrifice hanging before the throne almighty god that's right now how do you how do you get in there god by four dollars now god said that now put on your counts get them get open your heart look the bible said jesus was a lamb slain from the where foundation of the world he was slaying why god the father when he looked down and seen how jesus never come just to die half-hazard death he never come say well maybe some day uh somebody have pity when they see the way i died and everything no it was god don't run his business like that god runs his business perfect that's right he knows exactly what he was what was going to take place that's where he could forsake he knows just exactly he's not willing to eat your parents he's not willing but he's imminent he knows who will and who won't therefore you can rest assured if you have received god and be filled with the holy ghost you're anchored to your eternal destination correctly see he poor knows thank you god hallelujah thank you i can rest assured i can go home tonight brother richard and sleep like a baby i can rest assured that he's cutting all self if i'm anchored in christ hallelujah that's where i want to be anchored at tonight yeah amen that's like when we're dead and god has recognized our repentance he's recognized our baptism he's recognized the blood of his own son which by faith has been applied he recognizes his four nations and know that i do it it has recognized me in christ dead and christ died in my place when he was slain before the foundational world my name was put on the book as a christian hallelujah christ died my death christ is my sacrifice god could not impute to me sin anymore he's given me to seal the holy ghost as a witness that i pass from death in the life who that does it hey amen he said oh that does it amen he's gave me the shield of the holy ghost as a witness i've received eternal life right thank you lord hallelujah amen oh i'm sure glad that god knows all about us one more listen what he says now where are we today brethren where are we at if you abide in me and my words in you then you can ask what you will right and it'll be done for you now that's christ's own word the word has to abide in you that's right if you abide in me in christ and my word in you then how did we get into christ by baptism of the holy spirit then that's one part but then if you abide in me and then my words abide in you then you can ask what you will but you have to have both christ and the word and you're you really can't have one without the other that's right because it's the self same thing you can't have the father without having the son you can't have the son without having the holy ghost it's a self-same spirit so then see you can't you can't do it any other way then today god's provided absolutely for our lives now i'm tied to him by his word he's my absolute i found that it's a great and precious to live by him christ in me and me in christ amen he said i found out that it's precious to live by him hey man that's what i want to live by tonight hey man i don't want to live by nothing else but i want to live by him and i want him to be in me and me and him all right oh that's what i'm searching today hey man that's why i'm taking inventory daily say god you help me lord you help me to become a part of you you're a part of me amen you know there was a lot amen he was striving his herdsmans and abraham's herdsmen and everyone said hey this ain't that same can't this be that way that you choose you look and you choose if you go to the left i'll go to the right whatever y'all you go to the right i'll go to the left whatever i hit you hey man and chuck lott chose sodom all right hey man oh he seen him he thought why you know maybe one day i could be mayor of the city he looked he said my oh my i can do all this and all that but you know what he got down there and the bible says that the way they was doing it vexed his righteous soul daily but you know what lord lingered too long inside to where he became sodom and sodom became ill right oh god don't let me lean for too long hey man look what happened amen lost his wife amen all that she had to look back one last time oh god help me maybe not later too long amen and sorrow let me get out lord god where i can get out lord and let me become a part of you and you're a part of me it's like this i don't know if i ever stole the story here in my house but one day they built the titanic everybody knows about the titanic hey man forget what year it was but anyway they built it and they labeled the ship the unsinkable right they even had lifeboats on that ship but why have lifeboats if it's unsinkable right hey man could you imagine what a whole lot of faith so it's like saying i got a watch that can never lose time i got a car that can never get a wreck hey man i remember them getting on the getting on the uh uh oh no as they built it and they said uh uh uh operator rawlings operator back then i forget how many years she had to work in order to buy one ticket to go on its maiden voyage to riding first class one person got in there said they sucked to their knees in the carpet one lady got on there by the name of mrs cordova she had 72 trunks that was just for her clothes oh my god the rich and the luxurious is the ones that got on there he meant to take its maiden voyage and as she was getting on there she looked it to one of the dead cans and she said do you think this thing is really unsinkable and he looked at her and said ma'am god almighty can't sink this oh my god oh god can you imagine that's like what happened i think i forget what it was when a new york had a blackout 1960 or something and they said hey we'll fix it they said we fix it so we will never have another one 1977 they had another black house three separate boat of lightnings hit three separate power plants at the same time oh my god you don't mess with god that's right but anyways getting over i'm saying this because hey we're on this ride amen and america is going down i want to be in christ hey man she's sinking hey man there's nothing stopping her she's going down hey man i don't care hey man you can put a washington you can put a link in every county in the world she's going down but listen here's the story here that it was and they was getting on there and they was going and and they was taught they was good warnings i think seven warnings about icebergs that night seven warnings we've been through seven church ages oh man i had seven warnings the last warning ain't many cops sold out on there to where the operator took off his earphones and threw him down said shut up shut up we don't want to listen to the warnings anymore but they hit that iceberg right amen they knocked the first class plumb on their beds well one day i got hit by the word hey man see the up the second class they didn't feel it too much the third class didn't feel nothing at all but it was the common people that heard him gladly hallelujah one day i heard the word amen and it knocked me out of my bed hallelujah hey man oh there's a lot of people about to hurt it but it didn't do no good amen amen amen there's make believers there's uh uh uh unbelievers but hold up believer when he hears it he'll make his way amen i don't care come hell or eyewater he'll make his way to give his life to the lord amen and so there was good and so when they hit it it just so happens that the desire of the ship was aboard the titanic he went down there and he said he said if one compartment because of compartments we're filling up with water he said if one compartment was spilling up said you might we might could still float if two maybe but he said all sick i think it's six or seven is that all seven compartments are filling up since she's going down you better sound the warning but he hesitated and he hesitated the one at the end they had to held off the men from the lifeboats with guns he said nobody's getting on the lifeboats but the women and the children and in the end when it started listening and it was going down all the band there was a bright bunch of men they were playing with ragtime music to kind of keep the people calm but at the end they said you can hear them off in the distance playing near my goddamn that's right religion it was too late and then after it was all over said it done the questions was why why why why didn't they listen to warning why did this happen brothers and sisters america is going down amen if we don't get a hold of god christ and us and us in christ and the questions will be asked why why you young person why didn't you get ahold of god why well my mom and dad they have enough for me why why why didn't you come to church when you was supposed to why why are questions hey man she's going down that's right amen oh they wanted religion but it's too late people want ways too late but i want christ in me and me and christ heavenly

that but when it's all said and done we're warning when it's too late god before it's too late we stand here tonight said here lord sound of my voice lord one may say well i'll wait a while i got
