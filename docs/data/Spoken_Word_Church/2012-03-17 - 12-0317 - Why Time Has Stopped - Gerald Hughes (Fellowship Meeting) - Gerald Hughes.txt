let's just get started and who'll be first brother Tony come on we'll put you up first we'll give you number one today instead of giving it brother Homer he get number not life come on bless amen scri have scripture in the book of Acts chapter 17 vers 16 just read two verses now while Paul waited for them at our things his Spirit was sted in him when he saw the city poorly given to idolatry and escaped to 18 then certain men certain philosophies of the epicurian and of the stoics encountered him and some said what will this bab say after the some he seem to be a settler for a strange Gods because he preach unto them Jesus and the resurrection amen amen am I just want the lord to bless your heart with a lot of scripture I've been meditating on it and so many things in there could I see the Bible say when Paul was waiting I'm not preaching I'm not taking just just a little bit but just to see the up am when Paul was waiting now remember the bride is waiting yeah and Paul looked around and he saw that everything had been given to the the devil everything around him was bad and the bride is waiting we seeing everything going on around us is so bad come on yes amen the Bible say when Paul saw that when he saw that everything was holy now I'm just talking we understand what is going on right now everything the government politics the economies everything is wholly given to the devil yeah school system is given to the devil y so the Bible say when Paul saw that his Spirit was fed yes it's time for the bride to be stirred up Saints it's time for us to be stirred up because Paul was waiting the bride is waiting for one thing for the body change we are waiting for the coming of the Lord and we see all this thing around us is telling us the coming of the Lord is right here it's time for our spirit to get up and get ready God bless you let's stand up and sing one song and I invite brother K to come I don't want to preach brother hom is watching me said we didn't ask you to come here and pre just come here and greet we we we love you and uh we sending greetings of greetings from our church review We Appreciate brother there for giving us the opportunity to come and am I'm just excited because I see all these wonderful Brethren I I don't get to see everybody every day am but I know we are all connected we have one connection the Lord Jesus Christ amen I was looking at this thing like I never we don't have this in our church I think we need to have one and you know what I was looking I was looking at this I said why this thing was here I was doing a studies yeah where am I and then the scripture came to my mind the Bible said there got to be fire on the altar right and this one here is an altar the Bible said and the fire here in the middle of the Altar and that altar brother Brown said is our heart amen shall we sing this song here when I came in the message we used to sing this in Ghana he said um he has promised he will never fail but have a song too I want us to sing it he has promised yes he will never fail he has prom he has promises the Rapture he will never fail he has promises healing he will never fail he has promised

church God has spok Let the church oh let the church sayen Let the church [Music] the church the church sa Let the church Let the church say [Music] hallelu we sayen are you going are you going to praise him I you going to worship him you love you Ser you believe him the Bible I the word of God we believe you're coming to me oh Lord Jesus amen amen [Applause] hallelujah thank you Lord it's good to be able to say Amen so be it amen so be it the sisters have know one more Pew up here at the front so if some of the sisters wants to come on up this way just send them on up and there's an in Pew up here we reserved it for you okay come on good see oh praise the Lord I'm glad to be here amen yes and when I die Give Me Jesus amen so uh quite a message we have isn't it right quite a turn of events we're watching in this world quite a pressure coming down on people amen and we're feeling the effect of that pressure that's why our lives are so weighed down at times but but don't weary and well doing the Holy Bible says that church greets you sweet water we're having a great Revival and good things are happening just watching the word come to pass but as a way to encourage you I want you to know Brothers you may be the only brother in your whole neighborhood that takes the place as a man is supposed to MH sisters if you're right with the Lord and raising your children up you may be the only one in your whole neighborhood right right that is raising their children in the fear and admonition of God yes children even if you go to school you might be the only one dressed right you might be the only one that don't cheat in your class you might be the only one that stands for righteousness brothers who are EST Lish you may be the only one within miles of where you live that knows how to explain that hell's not Eternal or that we're to be baptized in his precious name not his titles what a position we hold just because of who we are and what's been given unto us so don't be discouraged we have a great opportunity we are turning the world upside down and and around and around and everything's being shaken because of the doctrine of this message amen and I believe we're g to we headed for some stormy seas but I believe that the same God that begun the good work is able to finish the good work right even the devil and all his tactics do nothing but to identify who we are so if you're being attacked much praise God much because that means you have something that he hates his life cannot be received by God but yours can yes and he is a devil of jealousy he is a devil of bitterness he is a a devil that wants to take all his attributes and try to put it on us oh yeah so we wonder why are all those people being so nasty it's because they got that all over them but they don't have the Blessed Holy Spirit to take it off of them amen We Gather here and these meetings are wonderful these meetings give us strength I I can't stand to miss these meetings I can't stand to not see my brothers every now and then to to get together to let you know that I'm pushing for the word yet I'm believing this message more than I've ever believed it before I remember years ago over in Arkansas we we would visit this church this small building smaller than this by far and it was just stuffed full and I remember there's not a place to sit but me and my wife and little children would come up and magically a place would form right in the front just like I saw today and you know maybe some of those folks were so simple they thought they were just giving us a place to seat what a blessing that would be know you know what they're doing they're giving us the opening of the word yeah so when you do something for someone you are preaching to them the opening of the word that is the position that we hold that's why we hold our high standards that's why we press to even love our enemies and extra love our brothers and sisters amen because we are the opening of the word people that's right your your life expresses that God did come down in the last day to reveal the Mysteries hidden in those seals the Mysteries hidden over over there at Rome so the bad guys exposed and the good guys revealed I just love it and I just can't wait to be in heaven also so let's press the battle and good to see all of you good to see brother Homer sister Margie and just so many others brother Tony my the world just doesn't understand so much I could say but I love the Lord a lot I believe the young ones have a song oh and this my nephew Joe stand up Joe say hi to them hi Joe they've known you for the last six years but that's him in the flesh God bless you come on up and see [Music] touch [Music] [Music] [Music] father I see that you are in sand I want to be

beautiful voices looking around brother Collins come on up greet the people then we'll get brother pad in the back come this way most everybody knows brother Colin who's been around quite a while he like me he's too much around in front but that all works out don't it brother Homer since I've known brother Homer he's gained and lost over ,000 PB God good I tell you I'm just kind a great honor to be here today and I tell them just thinking about you know kind of like to Millennium when you get to go to be with God's people oh yes be amongst them and the only thing that's kind of sad about it is when you have to leave a man but one of these days we're not going to have to do that we're going to I was thinking what brother Brown said he said you know in the first part of Millennium I'd like to be up in the mountains and and just be up by with those Eagles and and just be in the presence of God you know see the very creation of God but you know I tell you what I'm kind of like David said there kind he said like it's heart pain after the water Brooks he said so my soul pain after the deal you know it's something to have your soul hunger and for God I was listening to a little tape by day and right around said you know when you first kind of get saved he said God puts this new heart in you yes then said he'll put a a spirit in you new spirit and he said after that he puts his spirit in yes I believe that's the message that God has given us in this day praise the Lord God has put that in his people amen there nothing like this message on Amen I tell you what i' been a lot of churches a lot of services but when God opened up this word to my heart and let me see the truth of his word I tell you that the greatest thing could ever happen and ever since then my soul has been hungry and thirsting Hallelujah you know just to see what God's got in for for us in the next you know the next service or the next few seconds of time amen I believe he's got something for us today oh I believe he's got something in the service here today praise God that they not one of us will be the same after we leave this service today I believe we'll be different and be changed more like him amen praise God don't you love him today we just say it's a great honor to be here with brother Dale in the church and other brothers and sisters here some of you might not know you but

brother got a water problem you know busted water P but we've got a little special for you today so we want you to do it I wanted to make some tapes and we're working on that how many of you have ever heard brother George Canada brother Mike Canada brother Ernest Mo brother Tatum saying if I were you I'd make a change to be baptized in Jesus name amen they wrote the song according to the doing they heard it in 1962 going up to Jeffersonville and sister Fanny B Wade I Kid Sister Esther about she got to get her hands right because she if you ever knew her she played like the happy Goodman you know but she was good and uh but we you know we were able to get a hold of the taste about years ago and actually got original copy from where that they sang they wrote it in ' 62 they heard a course heard a a verse in a course going towards Jeffersonville and they wrote the rest of the song and they sang the song on the six seal at the end of The Sixth Seal they sang this song and in on the original you can hear even brother Neville say that must have been that some of that new mine speaking after them but we want the brothers to come and just sing unto you and then if you can if we can get them

now we ask that you cleanse us consec us we know prayers have already been made Lord and we tried to create an atmosphere for your presence and for the hearing of the word the speaking of the word but we're asking once again Lord that you will just let us to see you Lord oh God we know that you are the same yesterday today and forever and so Lord we are just believing now as we prepare to read your word and pass a few comments God that we will be able to be drawn closer to you that we will be able to recognize our day in its message yes we'll recognize if we've gone astray you show that to us Lord point us back to the straight and narrow Lord is the inspired songwriter said there's many a road in this world of sin but there's only one I'll trael yes the old Crossroad the wall straight the only way to the ply gate oh Lord help us tonight this evening to examine ourselves we thank you for what we have heard thus far and Lord the sweet Spirit of love and fellowship that we sense here in this building oh Lord and now may you just continue to bless us father we ask this in Jesus Christ name amen amen going to ask you to be seated just a moment now and then we're going to uh uh ask you to stand just once again and we'll read the scripture and that way it won't keep you standing quite so long but um again before I actually uh forget I wanted to express my appreciation for the invitation to be here once again and um I thought it was two years ago when I was here last but um maybe it was just last year you know we lose track of time after a while yeah but um I really appreciate uh I deem it a very special privilege to be here and so um you know one of the greatest things brother Homer that a man can give to another man is his Pulpit because there you're actually um offering into his hands your congregation amen and um the prophet of God said the most precious thing you know that we could ever hold in our hand would be the blood of the Lord Jesus outside of the purchase of that blood and by the grace of God then we have the purchase of his blood here this evening how many believe that do you believe you're the purchase of the blood then you're more precious in God's sight than his own blood if he didn't think he was more precious he would have never made the transaction at Calvary but I'm glad he did brother croan I'm glad he did yeah we used to sing that song I don't know why Jesus loved me but I'm so glad he did amen but you know we're beginning to understand a little bit more about why that he loved us amen with the great elective love right and so we really really appreciate all the comments that have already been made and and all the songs that have been sung and all the musicians and everything I'm not going to try to sing after all this for sure but uh we really appreciate um the good uh musicians and all the good songs and uh I appreciate my wife amen uh I I done that so that you all would get to see amen um now my wife and my sweetheart's the same girl amen and um we had nine children together oh and um by the grace of the lord they're all serving the lord and if it wasn't for her I I I wouldn't be here tonight but I appreciate my my little wife and uh have three son-in-laws by the way that are preaching this messag amen and so I'm thankful for my son-in-laws as well as my my sons I have three sons none of those have actually felt led to Minister and I sure don't want to push him if God don't pull them we better not push him right and uh but I do thank the Lord for the three son-in-laws uh that are in this message one of them is our associate pastor brother Tim cross brother Keith Brown down in St Augustine Florida pastors There Brother David Ben David PL over in Arizona he does quite a bit of missionary work and an evangelist so please pray for our family that God will continue to bless them and use them and um I apologize brother Dale for not having more of my people I brought one sheep I brought one sheep at least not totally empty-handed and uh uh the girls actually what happened I was a little bit late about making up my mind brother Dale and I apologize for that too but I appreciate the invitation and I told Brother Dale I'll pray and we'll see and and we kept waiting and waiting and uh then I when I finally made up my mind that it would be the the Lord would allow me to do it then um some most of our church had something else hard program in fact they had a clean up dayto dat at the church and to get together and so um you understand about that I guess but uh um I would just like to say again that I appreciate U the comments that's already been made brother Loria brother padet um I'm looking for his I there God bless you somebody was asking about you the other day brother uh it's JT and um I I said my it's been a while but I think he's still over there in Georgia somewhere and so it's certainly good to see brother pageant again and brother cran brother Tony um there he is God bless you from Ghana you pick up that accent if nothing else from Ghana and U we appreciate each one that has commented brother Collins and uh just everyone and I appreciate the pull that we fill here tonight right this evening um how many come with a spiritual appetite how many come to go to sleep in church you know Jesus said this in St John 4 the disciples come to try to get him to eat you know but he was about the father's business and he said I have meat that you know not of my meat is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work and so he had such a spiritual appetite that he wasn't even hungry for the middles even though it was past noon it was after dinner time so I hope y all didn't just come to get something to eat natural tonight but you come with a spiritual appetite and I'm sure that I went I may maybe I better not start talking about what I smelled in the kitchen it was really good but let's let's set our heart and affections on things above for just a little while tonight and uh I'm sure the Lord will bless us I wanted to start by receiving an offering if that's all right is that okay pastor give me opportunity to receive an offering now that's no I don't do that but I want to if I was to receive an offering I'd take your watches from you tonight the only clock I see is here and it's turned toward me right and so I'm not going to forget about what time it is but I I'd like for you to for just a few minutes tonight okay just forget about supper right the beans won't Scorch and uh if we'll set our heart and affections on things above I believe the holy spirit will help us Amen to be able to sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and that's what we're here for is that right and so let's just for a few minutes tonight give him uh all that we can I just appreciate brother Wade and brother Dale and and the camaraderie that we've had The Godly affections and um I trust that the Lord will just continue to BU our hearts together in Christian love there's healing and fellowship and um he sent his word and healed them so where the word of the Lord is there's power word the king is there's power and there's healing amen and we believe that God has given us uh uh his word in this hour amen and um any one of these ministers the first one to start off tonight I thought boy that's just the leadership of the Holy Spirit In fact I didn't have my mind made up they come back there brother longor and ask me what's what's your title I said I don't know yet and but just about uh 10 minutes ago I told them what the title of my sermon is but now we better take our text before we talk about the title okay amen and if you'd like to stand we'll uh invite you to turn to the Book of Joshua my was wishing I had I've got two sons That's not married yet and seen these young saintly looking young ladies I was wishing I'd at least got my sons over here amen praise the lord well maybe we can get some of y'all over our way sometime amen let's go to Joshua chapter 10 Joshua 10 and we'll begin reading with verse 12 and um I believe this is where the Prophet taking his text when he preached Paradox and uh but let's read here Joshua 10 and 12 if you have it say Amen am then spake Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the amorites before the children of Israel and he said in the sight of Israel son stand th thou still upon gibian yeah and thou moon in the valley of aelon and the sun Stood Still and the moon stayed until the people had Avenged themselves upon their enemies is not this written in the book of jaser so the sun Stood Still in the midst of Heaven and hasten not to go down about a whole day and from this scripture reading I want to take my title why time has stopped why time has stopped we've already prayed I want you to just reach over and shake your brother's hand your sister's hand beside you or behind you say God bless you Pilgrim it's good to be in Fellowship God bless you brother thank real honored to be here and then if you do that I'll let you be seated amen and um you know oldtimers I I I really got a little laugh back there in the study these um olders joshing one another about their shape and the weight and um I thought you know that's you know we never get up to the pyramid Capstone of love until we at first half brotherly kindness yeah and after hearing these brothers you know P these comments about one another I thought well man at least they have they've got to brotherly kindness because brotherly kindness is putting up with one another yeah that's what the prophet's definition of brother brotherly kindness is and we'll never get to the Capstone of love if we can't put up with one another but when you start talking about man's weight and his shape and his age it takes a lot of Grace and uh but I appreciate the good sense of humor that we have I've made the statement if I didn't have a little sense of humor I probably wouldn't have much sense at all you know but I'm glad for a little sense at least little sense of humor and uh but now in all sincerity and I think I I I know some of the others and maybe even other ministers um I know the pastors have been recognized do we have any evangelist or any other ministers to today that has God bless y'all amen I want you to pull okay help me out here help me out I seen that brother when he got his Bible and got out of the car and I said that looks like a minister and so I uh now here in this let's just let's pray in our hearts now the prophet of God said what you need is not be up here on the pull pit or on the platform what you need is to have faith in God and so right here tonight we have come not just to fellowship with one another but we've come to fellowship with him he wants our fellowship amen and um I believe with all my heart God has stopped time yes waiting for the Readiness of the church and I believe that beyond a shadow of doubt if you believe the Vindicated message of the hour I'll be able to convict you tonight because at the mouth of two or three Witnesses let every word be established you might say my time piece is still ticking the calendar is still flipping but I want to show you tonight by Vindicated message from God at least about a half a dozen locations come on where the prophet of God said that God has reached out his great hand and stopped time amen other places he said he holding time other places he said it's past time yeah and God is waiting for the Readiness of the church for us it's not us waiting on God God is waiting on us right and I believe with all my heart tonight I believe in this little service right here the Lord wants to speak to each of us yes and convince us of our responsibility that's it of our position of our Authority and how that the scriptures must be fulfilled amen before he can come amen and he's waiting on us to fulfill those scriptures am how many believe Jesus Christ is the principal theme of the entire Bible he is the principal theme of the Old Testament of the New Testament and if he is in us then that would make us then something principal in that thing amen like the brother said fire on the altar it should be fire in our heart where the altar really is hallelujah and so I'm going to encourage you as brother Wade said I he said when he turned me out of the shoot back there he said now seek him and I thought well you just keep on seeking me and the way we do that is by saying Amen to the word not to the man but to the word right and we understand that at one place the prophet of God said this business is not saying amen come from the Baptist or the Methodist from there it come from the Catholic and from there it come from the pits of hell this business of not saying amen so I tell you what maybe I just like to say this before we go forward how would you sisters that are here tonight young or old La have had the responsibility that Mary had to con re the word give birth to the word nurse the word train the word teach the word and bring that word to maturity right how would you like to have that responsibility you Brothers how would you like to have the responsibility that Joseph had overseeing and keeping safe and providing for and helping to bring that word to full maturity oh my let me tell you something something you have that same responsibility you and I brother sister young or old we all have that same responsibility today prophet of God said the secret is this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the more he said when you receive Jesus Christ or the Holy Ghost it's like Christ in be formed right Hallelujah and one place he said we can nurse him like Murray did by saying praise the Lord hallelujah glory to God Amen you know some people just don't want to nurse they don't want to be nursed they want to put a bottle somebody else say the amen you know stick a bottle or a paci maybe but we understand that we have that privilege and we have that responsibility of in the word right tonight amen right amen and it's more than just that's part of it I'm thankful for all the knobs now but don't be afraid to say Amen if it's you bear witness the word Bears witness in your soul ready don't amen the wrong thing now that's right don't just get carried away be sure that it goes through the filter Amen Hallelujah Jesus was the word made flesh yes Hallelujah and we understand that there was six Overcomers in the days of John the Baptist that was Joseph and Mary Zachariah and Elizabeth Simeon and Anna just six just six that's right all the rest of them in the message how can I overcome brother said they offered their sacrifices they worshiped maybe there were hundreds thousands millions but only six that's what he were these were the elected ones he said yes these were the elected ones but you realize that Joseph and Mary left the word how many knows what the first recorded words of the Lord Jesus in the New Testament that's right how many knows what's the first red letter recorded words of the Lord Jesus first words that he spoke it might be the last words he speaks also but he's still speaking we're glad for that but what did he say when he was just 12 years old the first recorded words knowest thou not that's right how is it that you seek me that was his first words how is it that you sought me knowest thou not that I must be about my father's business yes that's right and anybody was asking a question and he was also bringing a rebuke he was rebuking his own mom and daddy in the presence of of all the elders and all the priests but I said that to say this that the elect can't leave the word we get the idea oh we're so predestinated we're so right and we're so much the bride of Christ go now Joseph and Mary both left the word supposing him to have been in the I like to put it like this the Bible says in the company in their kin folks and so forth but the little Church of Nazareth had come down to the Church of Jerusalem you find this in Luke chap 2 I'm not going to preach on that but I just felt to bring it in amen amen amen thank you the Church of Nazareth it was their custom to go down and have a convention at Jerusalem God's chosen place of worship where God had put his name and here it was the most important Feast the Feast of Passover and and the Passover Lamb Jesus Christ was at the Passover feast and they left the word wow the elected ones left the word you say I don't know about that brother Hugh listen when brother Ram seen the bride passing in review come on right he seen the church pass first right the true bride and then he seen come back around finally the last but he noticed that some of them long for the last was getting out the step right in the message how can I overcome brother said Le deia needed a sharp rebuke amen and he said it twice and then not only does the not only does the Sheep go astray yeah but sometimes Shepherds go astray too yeah how many believe that and if the blind lead the blind where they going to end up right amen amen so we understand that the voice of God come to be our guide and God still speaks through a fold ministry right amen and he still speaks through his prophet and the Spirit and the prophet and the bride all say the same thing right do you know Joseph and Mary represented the Ley yeah they were just common people Joseph wasn't a minister Mary wasn't a minister zachari and Elizabeth was now right yes so you have six Overcomers Joseph and Mary Zachariah and Elizabeth represented the ministry brother said go listen to it and then Simeon and Anna a prophet and prophetess right Hallelujah so you got your six classes or three classes rather of Overcomers now nowh do you find where Simeon had to be corrected not saying that God didn't correct him in his lifetime but in the Bible I'm talking about but you know what the Joseph and Mary had to stand corrected right Zachariah had to stand correctly right I believe it's probably one of the first cases of Divine Healing in the New Testament he was healed of his um sealed lips dumbness and I believe it might be one of the last things that takes place too is whenever us message ministers gets the dumbness out of our voice where we can speak the word of God Amen now think about it Zachariah was was an overcomer he was a message preacher don't tell me he wasn't yeah he had received a message from the angel same angel that visited Mary but he doubted the message he questioned it in the wrong way now it looks like Mary questioned it but see it was a different attitude that Mary had right amen she wasn't spitten D that's right but when Zachariah questioned the angel messenger see and I think that's the problem many times we get too much up here amen instead of the new birth we want an intellectual conception something we can understand instead of believe got let me tell you something God never did call you first to understand and then to believe we do not understand in order to believe we believe in order to understand believe first then the revelation come understanding will come God want you to follow the guide you're not subject to discern which direction to go without a guide you don't try to go to British Columbia and go on a moose hunt or elk hunt without a guide that guy has to sign your license he's responsible for you yeah and he is officially appointed by the government to be a guy and I'm not talking about British Columbia I'm talking about the Church of the Living God and God has promised the Holy Ghost in This Hour to be our Gody and he S A Vindicated guy the Vindicated messenger a Vindicated message you question that gu you're lost I don't care who you are you try to interpret his directions you try to interpret or misconstrue oh I think it ought to be this way or it ought to be that way you better stay just the way the guy Le Hallelujah oh brother may the Lord help us that's for you and that's for me Church age book brother BR said in every age the church goes astray are we still in an age you say oh it's a bride age nobody can go astray be careful and more astray in this age oh my in every age the church goes astray and not only the Ley but clergy goes astray too shepherds are wrong as well as sheep and when I point my finger out preaching the gospel I know I got three more pointing back at me and I believe in Shepherds Hallelujah yeah and questions and answers on the seals brother BR was asked will the bride have a Ministry brother BR before the Rapture he said well sure he said it's going on right now it consists of Apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers amen oh right yes sir and so we see that God has a true five-fold Ministry amen but the only way that we can know amen hallelujah how was how did they know in that first age brother C how did they know in that first Ephesian age Jesus commanded them for trying the apostles yeah that's right thou H has tried those who call themselves Apostles I think one of the first signs of a false false Apostle is one who calls himself an apostle I'm this or I'm that go ahead now but thou has DED them and how did they try them they tried him by the word of the age you're not saying what Paul said right he say right oh my and if they're not speaking according to the law and the prophets there's no light in them Hallelujah yes throughout Seven Ages the church is going astray and shepherds are wrong as well as sheep right in that same paragraph brother Ram said but then through the ministry of these seven Messengers God Capital God brings himself on the scene as the chief shepher let me tell you something the CH shepher never goes astray no the chief Shepherd never leads astray Hallelujah you might leave the word but the word ain't going to leave you oh my Joseph and Mary went about a Day's Journey and then they realized that they left the word they realized that they had left the word and when they did the Bible says after 3 days right they found him right that's right now it was only a day Journey away from him but it was at least two maybe two and a half days to find him and you know where he was right where they left him that's where they found him and that's where you'll find him that's where I'll find him when I leave the word I got to go right back to that word because when you leave the word you leave God there's only one reason young man young lady teenager young or old there's only one reason for God's displeasure with you and I and that's for you to leave the word that's for me to leave the word and there's only one remedy to regain his favor that's back to the word back to the word repent and come back to the word every new and fresh Revival every true and fresh Revival comes when men and women have gotten back to the word of God for their age don't you want a truth the fresh Revival in your heart in your home in your church in Search and make sure don't take for granted right so he is in the church praise God let's assume he is but remember they was advention without Authority he could be in the church and still not be in you honey he could be in the church and I could be in the church and him not being me sailing over life solom man brother I got the quote right here he said in this little ship there's only room for Jesus you on the Jericho Road amen there's room for Just Two amen amen no more and no less just Jesus and you amen it's a n passage amen it's going down steep way below sea level you remember the old song on the Jericho Road amen and that's the road we're on hallelujah it's a humble Road amen right coming down humbling yes oh my yes amen God's identification is never with the group that might not sound too popular but that's the word of the Lord can I say that again I'm quoting your Prophet you ought to know what he said he said it God's identification is never with a group God's identification is always with the individual Hallelujah Always With the Enemy so he is in the church praise God so he is in the bride praise God but what about in you yeah what about me that's what counts he's not going to ask you amen is he with your mama and your daddy he's going to say Amen is he in your heart I will not leave you comfortless I will come unto you oh we need that guide Amen to uh help us not only to read the lines but to show us what's between the when you fall in love with him oh my fall in love with the GU then you can have Assurance amen you know where you come from you know where you're going you know the count of the Cadence of God's word thank you Lord bear with me now I'll tell you what the word of the Lord he said as many as I love I will rebuke Jesus you might have a little you coming this evening you might have a little chastisement coming if you do say thank you Lord for your love thank you Lord for your love thank you for speaking to me Lord oh yes that's a good sure indication Hallelujah that he loves you yes oh my but one thing about the El they'll always come back to the word might leave the word but one thing for sure always come back the Bible says after 3 days they found him is that right oh my yes and so we see that it's um very serious thing to leave the word now this evening I'd like to remind you that God loves Fellowship this is fellowship meeting right God so loves Fellowship that his only purpose of existence is fellowship with his family God so loves Fellowship that the only personal request that Jesus asked for in St John 17 prayer was for your fellowship God so loves Fellowship how would you like to be the only one exist exting in eternity how would you like to be eloh him the self-existing one I'd get pretty lome wouldn't you you know when God made man he said it's good good first 2 3 4 5 six day but on the sixth day when he made man his own likeness in his own image he said it's very good and then next chapter he said it's not good for man to be alone that's right amen God wants fellowship and so we see that brother BR put it like this he said go in order to give himself a reason for being had to predestinate a church that would need Redemption we look at brother Brenham trying to commit suicide tried his best right is that right with a gun tried it with the Highline War didn't work what was being reflected God's lonesomeness he had just lost part of his family he just lost his sweetheart his bride and God whole purpose of existence today is his bride his whole purpose before the foundation of the world was the church Hallelujah in other words God's purpose of existence his main purpose is not to create the universe and the universe and the the milky white way and all the great but it's you you're the purpose of God's existence and without you God's main purpose I don't like to use the term spiritual suicide but he'd have a tendency to want to commit suicide but he's got a purpose he's got a plan and that plan will not be defeated God wants your fellowship he want and he can't have it when you leave the word no he can only have it as you Fellowship in the word his Fellowship is in the son and his son is the word his Fellowship is under the blood is that right and there's least about 11 places where brother said Jesus is sitting there with his own bloody garments right now Hallelujah interceding for you and I his own bloody garments think about it he didn't go away naked he went away with those bloody garments representing the blood Hallelujah that was shed for you and I today it's not just the chemistry of the blood but the bleeding word of God is bleeding blood to wash the bride in and it's been rejected aresh crucified aresh yes Hallelujah let's not amen be guilty of the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ let's be sure we don't change the word we're not called to change the word we're called to believe the word we're called to obey the word is that right amen sure we're not here to get the people to ourselves we're not here to get the people to the church we're here to get the people to Christ Christ is the oh my sure he comes through the church sure thank God for the church amen but let's be sure that we're putting him first and letting him have the preeminence amen the great man calls himself a bishop of many of the churches in Africa we had a communion foot washing don't cross-examine me cuz I'm not want to throw off on the brother but I I just seen something instead of coming then you know to maybe offer to wash somebody's feet he sits down crosses his hands on the front W somebody wash his feet let's examine ourselves did we come just to be served or we come to serve if the son of man is in US amen we need to Humble ourselves the key to power the secret to power we're taught is humility the disciples right up at the communion supper in the Passover chamber were busing about who's going to be the greatest leader going to be the greatest message Pastor or who's going to be the Apostle who's going to be the general Overseer in the message because Jesus is talking about leaving and they were arguing right at the last right at the communion table what an attitude to bring to the table of the Lord busing about who's going to be the greatest and Jesus said now boys he said what I am going to do now you won't understand now but you will understand later and what did he do he pul laid aside all of his garments yes deity greatness was being unveiled they were fussing about who's going to be the greatest and he showed him who was the greatest and he showed him how to be the greatest because he GED himself only with the towel and he came down nobody offered to wash Jesus feet exactly on find it in the Bible at that communion supper not at the communion table no his feet needed woring too he needed a refreshing sure but not a one of his disciples right even offered to wory feet one of them was resisted his wory yeah what about us tonight he's trying to wash us with the washing of the water of the word right here tonight don't draw back if I worh you not you have no part with me whatsoever hallah let the word worh you tonight hall hallelujah he'll present to himself a bride without spot or blemish by the washing of the water of the Vindicated spoken word of God for our day it we just stay under it Hallelujah me on it it's spiritual me to do season it'll nurture you up to where you can fly on your own sometimes he might have to take you away as a little eagly one place he talking about that eagle that he he got out of the uh Barnyard and he said Lord take us away to the eagle nest where you can nurture us up Amen to where we can fly on our own s through the heavens amen oh God wants us to be real eaglets is that right yeah and I came in this evening I was kidding brother Dale little bit he standing out here and I said is this uh is this where the carcass is he said well yeah I don't know he said I don't think we're all dead yet though something like that you know and uh and I caught what he was trying to say we're still in the process of dying I thought that's real humble brother Dale and I think we all need to consider that yes are we still maybe in the process of dying out to ourselves to our own ideas to our own will to our own way Jesus said I've not come to do my own will but I've come to do the will of him or S you see even though you're born again God doesn't take away your self will he doesn't take away your free moral agency Jesus himself had a self-will Hallelujah and if he had to surrender his with desperation and prayer what about you and I desperation yes the greatest weapon ever put into the hand of man brother Bram said is prayer the greatest weapon put into the control of man it's in your control you can choose to pray or not to pray you can choose to read your Bible or not read your yes go ahead brother said We Lay get ready to lay down and we might give him one or two minutes of prayer and then we say good night Lord amen and then too if we'll examine ourselves I've caught myself you know we want treat God like an Aaron boy God do this for me do that for me yes you know and good night Lord get up and have a little Bible reading in prayer and say oh Lord what's our request now do this for me do that for for my sister do that for my brother goodbye Lord be with me today Lord be my guide Lord we treat him like a little Aaron boy but we're encouraged and instructed to worship him he wants our fellowship create an atmosphere oh like we've created here tonight make him welcome where can come Hallelujah and speak to our hearts on a onetoone basis let us know that he loves us let us know that his whole purpose of existence is us that's good we read where Joshua stopped the sun amen but I want to read to you tonight where a man done something greater than that right Hallelujah right are you ready I said I want to show you where somebody done something greater than what Joshua did in the Bible if you have it let's go I've got it in two different locations but it's the same event and it's the only place in the Bible where you'll find this happening We Begin Matthew chapter 19 and in verse 29 and as they departed from Jericho Matthew 1929 while you turnning I'm going to get a good drink this H2O and U I'll make everybody thirsty just by enjoyed it probably you're welcome to it if you want just come get it I'll share it all right chapter 29 everybody still awake everybody happy amen oh boy and as they departed from Jericho a great multitude followed him and behold two blind men sitting by the wayside when they heard that Jesus passed by cried out saying have mercy on us oh Lord th son of David and the multitude rebuked them yeah because they uh should hold their peace but they cry the more yeah instead of getting quieter they got louder say Have Mercy oh on us oh Lord th son of David notice in verse 32 brother BR said Jesus didn't see blind barus amen he didn't even hear him calling because all the multitude and all the commotion was going on and he was off the beaten pack he wasn't right on the road uhhuh but he said he felt his faith amen hallelujah all right and the Bible says Jesus Stood Still Glory Hallelujah and called them and said what will ye that I should do and they said unto him Lord that our eyes may be opened amen so Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes and immediately their eyes received sight and they followed him wonder if maybe tonight we don't need our eyes open a little bit more we find the same incident I believe in Mark 10 and beginning with verse 46 and they came to Jericho and as he went out of Jericho his disciples with his disciples and a great number of people blind barus the son of timus Sat by the wayside begging just a blind beggar and when he heard that it was Jesus Oh my of Nazareth he began to cry out amen I believe we can still reach him by crying out to him don't you I he can still be touched by the feeling of our infirmities amen and say Jesus th son of David have mercy on me and many charged him that he should hold his peace but he cried the more a great deal th son of David have mercy on me and Jesus stood still right yeah only place in the Bible where you find where the Bible says that Jesus Stood Still in the Book of Joshua we see the creation right being stopped by Joshua's faith and the Sun and the Moon perhaps it was evening time how many seen the moon coming up while the sun still up sure maybe in the evening time oh my hallelujah what a good time when you realize time's running out Joshua with inspiration and Faith spoke and time had to stand still I haven't forgotten my text hold with me now here Joshua had stopped the creation in the heavens the moon the sun yes but here the the same kind of Faith but it was in blind B and he stopped the very Creator himself the one who created the son he stopped the Son of God hallelujah and our faith can stop him here tonight thank you Lord your faith can still reach him if you'll cry out but he wants you to be in desperation Hallelujah And when everybody else says be quiet it's not for you you got to know it is for you amen hallelujah amen yes one stopped the creation but the other stopped the Creator amen oh my just think he had been uh now let's just go forward a little bit here and I want to ask the question why why did Joshua do that why I'll tell you why because he need a little bit more time to fulfill the commission he needed a little bit more time to fulfill that Great Commission of that day to place the people in their inheritance to divide to them their promised land to drive out the enemy and to claim their possession the promised land and today these promises have been made to the right if God didn't know you needed a double portion he wouldn't have promised a double por if God didn't know I would need a double portion in this hour he wouldn't have promised a double por but we need it and God promised it and we can have it hallelujah oh my for for the day there has to be a faring time Hallelujah there has to be a quick short work Hallelujah I don't know what it's going to take but I do know one thing God has stopped time waiting for the Readiness of the church amen amen amen now when I kind of pretended ask permission to receive an offering tonight I was thinking about this quote right here am so follow along it's an expectancy 1952 brother BR said see obedience do what he tells you to do no matter what it looks like do what he says do and God will take care of the rest of it don't you think amen oh if the church could only get to a place where they just forgot about the routine am what about right here tonight when's the best time to start this when's the best time to obey the word only time you can't obey the word he in the Pres oh if the church only got to the place to where we just forgot about the routine or whatever it is just lose sense of time yeah or anything else and just stay with God do what he says do don't you believe the church needs a spiritual leading like that yes we got our programs all drawn out and lined out and so forth I don't believe it was ever intended for the Apostolic Church of God to be led by program I believe it's the program of God to lead us by his holy spirit just the way he will my yes our programs he says takes up all of our time in this uh worst sinter in the city 56 yes well our programs take up all of our time we got too many things to do so we uh got to be taken care of see and uh he said I wonder sometimes that maybe we hav it just went off without Jesus like the disciples did you know that night on the ship amen his own disciples went off without him that's when the storm hit is that right that's when all the devils in Hell swore amen that they would seink that ship now listen is everybody all right let me give you another good dose here okay that's where man's Eternal destination is determined yeah believing every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God Amen in the beginning of the book right Mary did or Eve did not let the devil misconstrue a whole paragraph or a whole sentence it was just one word she didn't disbelieve the whole book is just one word right is that right in the middle of the book Jesus come and said man shall not live by bread alone but but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God amen amen and then blessing in Revelation 3 1 and verse three is pronounced upon all who read the words of this book and all who hear the words of the prophecy of the book now this message this voice of God that we've received in the end time I'm here to tell you is the words of the prophecy of the book and you better hear it hear ye him Hallelujah right Hallelujah hear ye Fe on the word for the hour it was stored up just for you to give you rapturing Faith somebody referred to it here the message absolute brother mam said here's one of them hear them rapturing Faith lays in these messages he said amen sure all right I may be paraphrased it a little bit but you go listen to it now in this message Harvest Time 64 he talks about hanging over hell with a chain right amen right and that chain is only as strong as its weakest link and you're hanging over Hell by Chain of God's promised word and you don't have to break the whole all the different links all you have to break is one link because the chain is only as strong as its weakest Le amen one word amen remember how brother B was standing by the three steps he said my dear old mother she only had one or two dreams something like that her whole life amen said they all was from God Amen prophet of God said it was from God now okay you can turn it out if you want to here sister brother pastor but listen he said my per my message perfectly three steps coming up like justification s baptism ghost this lady coming up with her Spike heel or high heill you know shoes coming up there and brother Brown's mother dear old mother and the said you can't walk that you can't go up these steps and walk that straight narrow line that pearly line that leads up to heaven with those heel he you know oh yeah brother brand maybe just want said it you go back and listen to it amen but anyway she said I'll show you how I can do now she just missed one word yeah she got up the three steps yeah she came up on three step and she started just going right on up but it got Nar and N yeah and she fell off amen into hell that's what it said weeping wailing nashing of teeth all the terrible cries brother B said and so amen just one word it's all she missed oh brother he that don't matter about high heel shoes and split tail skirts revealing my underneath clothes on what kind of spirit is it on a woman or a young lady that would make her want to reveal her underneath clothes now we're Leia yeah right amen every word it just takes one word this I'm just talking about the ABCs now we ain't got the algebra yet how we going to do the algebra if we ain't doing our ABCs oh it's okay to cut my hair just a little bit surely no you know the loose edges and you know just trim it off a little bit keep the scissors out of it the prophet if you don't cut it at all you might as well Shake save your head you're dishonorable your prayers won't be heard until you repent of that and let that hair grow you're a dishonor to God and a dishonor to your husband if you got one or a dishonor to the husband that you're going to have is that right sure this little things for your hair was giv you for your covering the man was not made for the woman but the woman was made for the man is that the Bible then we as the bride ought to realize that we're made for his gratification not for our fulfillment we should be praying God what would you have me to do to fulfill your will my meat my desire is to fulfill Hallelujah finish his work now look I have to hurry here and that's where man's Eternal destination is determined he'll hang over Hell by the chain or he'll hang over by Creed and that if there's a Creed mixed into the chain there's where the weak link is you're gone amen that's where the weak link was with Adam and with Eve that week L surely he said God but surely God said it amen and if God said it God meant it and he also keeps his word by saying the day that you eat thereof that day you die listen close now the day you put into you anything else besides the unadulterated word of God into your soul that's a day you're separated from God woo that's strong medicine folks yeah but we better be dting down to this Living Word you better not be feeding on a television evangelist every Tom Dick and Harry with his special interpretation right that's a seed of discrepancy you better so know that God has send you a Vindicated message to where you'll die right now and feed on that word hallelujah oh Hallelujah there's a this prophetic Plass of people has the ability to hear the word by way of the messenger Hallelujah she's got an ear to hear she's not questioning and going back into denominationalism she might be tempted to do it but she'll not do that amen she'll hold herself faithful in Tru hallelujah amen listen to this same message time now you see it's not your good living that's just something goes with it it isn't your church loyalty that goes with it but the main thing is staying with the word don't eat nothing else but that word stay with it he is that word now we want to watch close now am amen now what are we feeding on listen to this once end time 65 you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man if you haven't fed fully on every word to give you strength to Fly Above All all these denominations and things of the world will you at this time do it amen he says while we pray and we're coming to that time here tonight in the message so I want you to just give me just a couple more minutes now if we're feeding on this is about the only place I've ever heard brother Brown say it maybe it's another place or two but he says we're feeding upon the body word he calls it the body word right if it's the body word amen then it's the word in the body amen thank you come on he was asked the question what what does it mean brother B in Luke 24 or Matthew 24 where Jesus said wheresoever the carcass is there will the Eagles be gathered together amen he said well he said Luther was the carcass amen Wesley was the carcass for his nameen they had that body word and it was the word in the body yeah see you had to hear Luther's message or you it takes the message of the age to Quicken the seed of the age huj and if you can be quickened by the message of your age praise God that's a good sign you're a sheep of God oh you heard from your theophany hallelujah oh my sister Le writes that song you know oh my just uh hear your voice and yours alone you know amen you're just ding right down Hallelujah and listen if that five-fold Ministry is not saying the same thing you don't want to be hearing it is that right sure it's got to say the same thing yes amen now God didn't send me to correct brother brandom he didn't send the fivefold ministry to correct brother BR he s brother to correct the five is that right oh my and that's his love to us many as I love I will rebuke and Chason the word always corrects the error that's what he was doing the very first time that he spoke about the father's business correcting the denominational eras and if he's about that business here tonight he'll be doing the same thing in you he'll be doing the same thing in me amen the main thing stay with that word amen now you know I believe that well if I didn't believe that I was in the will of the Lord I wouldn't be here but I believe it was the Lord that placed on brother Wade brother Dale for to ask me invite me to come and I didn't take that lightly I took it very seriously yes and U so you know if you're not doing what god listen what brother BR says here he said like this he said now listen to this God is so arranged it that his program cannot move without you and I amen as long as we're not doing what God leads us to do we're paralyzing his program oh my good paralyzing his program wow if the program of God is paralyzed time is stopped amen sure going to take it a little further here now just bear with me but when the church moves by the anointing of the Holy Ghost then we're in God's will doing his program am thank you Lord amen amen now expectations we've got to get back to do his great uh into into the program of God and find out after all what God wants us to do and the only way I know to do it is prayer prayer is the key yeah that's the answer prayer changes things prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the control of human beings there's no atomic bomb no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer hallelujah we're left without excuse amen amen it's put in your control you have that ability and when the weakest of Christians goes to their knees and prayer the foundations of Hell shiver the we amen I'm going to skip some of this here just going down now uh this is 1961 I want you to notice the time setting sir we would see Jesus Bloomington Illinois as our scientists tell us it's long ago 3 minutes until midnight yeah but we know we know this is the prophet of God speaking now we know the hand of God has stopped time to wait just long enough uh long just long suffering like he was in the days of Norah amen our differences yeah has turned him away our separation of Brotherhood and the way that we we've sent after the things of the world instead of the things of God we ought to have been Plum into canaan's land and here we are in the wilderness wandering around and around just like they did back there we should be having all kinds of gifts signs and wonders in our churches instead of that God can raise up something and then we all get scared of it and walk away and say we don't understand these things what do you think they done in the wilderness for 40 years walk around and around the same old grounds we took acts 24 acts 24 acts 24 we've run it to death let's go on I think they s about that tonight the promised land is there for whatsoever thing you desire When you pray believe you receive it and you shall have it acts 2 and for is right but it ain't all of it that's right there's more of it that's right that's every promise in the Bible is ours it's given to us by the Lord Jesus and his Great Mighty hand is holding time for us to possess the land that's been given to us ain't that why he stop time then waiting for them to possess the land right and the same thing has happened in this how many knows he call that an Ephesus Joshua parallels the book of Ephesians they had go listen to the a message Paradox amen and so we see that another Ephesus has come hallelujah we're back to the beginning back to the true church the first church full restoration seat oh my yes I believe uh let's see here now Abraham seed after him listen to this let's just bow our heads he's talking about prayer so we're coming down to close the message here today so please bear with me and listen closely let's bow our heads he says heavenly father I don't know nothing else to say at this hour surely the people can understand Lord we're at the end time science says we are 3 or 4 years ago we were 2 minutes until midnight yeah and 3 minutes or or or 3 minutes I believe the great hand of God reached out and stopped time the pyramid came is just about to be set on top the church is being honed down and seeing its last sign Lord let them people wake up and realize they're looking for something way out yonder in the future and it's happening right under their nose and they don't realize it again um Abraham and his seed after him 61 do you know what God did he reached it's past time he reached out his hand and stopped it GL he's holding time in his hand for the church to make itself ready am share the trains in the block sure the flashy red lights are here but he stopped TI yeah he's holding time in his hand for the church to make itself ready there's a few more members yet to come into the body of Christ maybe what be one of here one of them here is here today amen that's why I'm here am that's why I'm LED here is to try to persuade you amen amen am just a little later then in the message is it I Grand Prairie Alberta Lord Jesus the hours are growing late and dark I don't know just what time you might come I believe that you you've reached your great hand out and stopped time amen just a little while I'm going to skip over some of these amen Lord Jesus I'm reminded the old I believe it was Buddy Robinson that brother Brandon quoted said Lord feel my Gable of my soul with good things and then nudge me when I've said enough oh Lord give me backbone like a solog yes Lord Lord let me fight the devil till I ain't got no more teeth in my head let me gum him till I die Lord let us be so determined and Lord these uh Elders here that I'm glad to be identified with them Lord but let us have that determination and father may we remember the prophet of God said if I had a choice it'd be that last 75 year or 25 years of my life oh my maybe from 75 to 100 I'd be more season more experienced more determined God renew our strength then as Eagles Lord yes father let us reexamine ourselves Lord and may these your children know that I'm not here thinking I'm I'm here to correct somebody God you know better Lord but Lord You're Here We Believe to correct us all and I stand Lord with my brothers and sisters and Lord we want to be right but father we want to be uh know that the only criteria that we have is to stay with the word even the manifestations that balum had prophesying of the star rising out of Jacob one of the greatest and most perfect prophecies given yet we know that he was not an elect of God cesis another great demonstration of the manifestation of God prophesying of how the Lord Jesus one must die not all Israel and yet we know that he there was no evidence or no scripture indicating that he was a spirit filled Lord may we not take a sensation may we not take an emotion may we not take a organization or an affiliation may we not take anything but the spirit of God and the word of God lord may you vindicate uh Beyond where we can Lord we cannot do it ourselves it takes you we can say We Believe but it takes you to confirm our faith Lord and you're here we believe to do that for every individual we haven't just time to fellowship with one another Lord but we desire your fellowship above all oh Lord Jesus and if we find oh Lord where that we've left the word any portion of that body word God if we've not been feeding on all that word then Lord grant Grace to repent here tonight as as it's written per Adventure that God would Grant repentance unto the acknowledgement of the truth and Lord we know the Zeal of the hour is to say yes Lord I'm wrong you're right Lord we think of Hebrews I believe it's chapter 11 the closing part the closing two or three verses how Paul talked about all these Heroes of Faith then he said and they without us are not made perfect brother Ram said they have to have this ministry to raise them up then Lord may we realize here this evening that we cannot have a resurrection and a Rapture until we each one come to our place till we let the word mature in us and Lord we mature in the word how can we uh ever recognize the revealed word our husband who is Among Us unless we're continually constantly in that word all being led by the spirit we remember the lord of the Harvest how before he sent out the 12 also before he sent out the 70 he said you pray said to them to the 12 to the 70 pray ye the lord of the Harvest that he'll send forth labors into the Harvest then your servant and Prophet ask the question why if he is the lord of the Harvest and we know he is why knowing that they he's going to do it why did he ask them to pray yes because God's program cannot work without you and I even the preaching of the Gospel oh my everything it's the program of God so Lord help us now not to paralyze the program of God yes because when we do Lord we're responsible for the stopping of time but God when we're in your program fulfilling the Great Commission we know Lord until that last one comes in there will be no Resurrection there will be no Rapture you must stay there and intercede till that last one com in and you will not be satisfied the great Shepherd will not be satisfied until that last predestination comes the let us have that cry then other sheep have I oh that are not of this fo let us reach out Lord to the regions Beyond let us have a burden like Jesus had oh the same burden for he said as the father sent me so send I you help us Lord to be a real missionary minded individual and church Grant it dear Lord oh God we thank you Father for this privilege that we have of examining ourselves now in the light of your word we thank you Father that you have kind of dressed us down a little bit maybe father and Lord caused us to examine and see if there's any portion of that written or spoken word that we've neglected may we remember that when we spurn one word we're spurning the very he gloin of God the very seed of life the only thing that'll give us a word body oh Lord the thing it's formed around is every word that Bride As Solomon said we have a little sister what shall we do in that day she spoken for she has no breast God you will not take an immature rde that's right Lord God let us come to full maturity to every word believing every word doing our very best Lord to obey every word Grant it dear God help us Master Lord you know our needs here tonight father thank you speak to this congregation some won't get to come back tomorrow perhaps some will have to be traveling and have their own responsibilities and we honor

scriptures and but Lord it takes you it takes your presence father I pray dear God Hallelujah Lord Lord that we realize God the judgments of God are just pending and Lord we have but a short time and
