thine understanding and let your light shine in our hearts in Jesus name amen Jans 1 verse3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved you may be seated Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now we we've been speaking about and talking on predestination and we come up to the adoption or point and it it will take a while to cover these things on adoption so we are just uh you know we're going to change the title and we've got up to about 27 somewhere in there services on a predestination it will still be on the same point but we're just going to change the title today and and to start off say on adoption all right in the next two or three services I don't know really how many it will take but uh it will be the the point will be is uh adoption in three stages or three phases or whatever you want to make the point um it's hard to sometimes speak words to get what you want to say like the prophet was saying about you know uh we we believe in the three three stages of Grace he'd say it like that then he turn around he say well now now we don't believe in three stages said it's not three stages of Grace but said because you know that would kind of make it different he said it's three stages of the same Grace it just takes a while for it to to be able to come into manifestation see so then it's not not to say three steps but yet it is three steps see I just want to say it he would say we believe in that but then he'd say now uh it's just a continuation you see if you're Justified truly in this day then you're you're going to come to the place of sanctification and then if you're Sanctified you're going to come to the baptism of the Holy Ghost see so then it's it'll be bringing it to an understanding or Clarity to where that we can can uh you know follow it you know but we don't want to just make it say this set line we try to keep it to where we can can understand and that's what we're going to be covering in adoption uh you'll see it as we go along now we we covered uh the last message I've got this up here for some we've had some extra uh prayer Clause but I'm laying this up here where we can pray over it and uh you know cut up some extra prayer Claws and things but we have some more up here today if you need some all had a good time yesterday in the Bible study we all just kind of let our high down and and begin to just talk and you know and fellowshipping and it it was really really enjoyable uh to uh you know to be able to to just talk talk about things and and the things that God hates you know and all like that so it was we really you know the Bible says seven things that he hates and it was like a lying tongue or a proud look or different things you know so we just kind of all let our heart down and begin just to talk and found out we're all human that's right you know we're just all human you know we all have problems right and we try not to dechristianize anybody we try to to be what we are and then try to work on her doing but it's like the conclusion that we all reached of one thing for me to try to get you out of a lying tongue or a proud look or etc etc uh that you know that's that may be all right but but when I look and see myself right and then I work on myself right cuz that's the main thing is is getting that to to the point all right now but we're going to talk on a op option and in said we're going to cover it in in three stages or or whatever you want to call it whatever frame of words you'd like to use but we saw in our last couple of messages that my point was one thing there's never been an age that it was predestinated that's right to come forth right you know as it is in this age amen that's right and I hope you you followed that in the message that uh you know Moses he didn't build an ark right to try to float the children of Israel out of Egypt right because that had already been done that was for the hour that was there for Noah and it was a predestinated seed and it would have to come to pass and I believe God has things predestinated to where that it can't be changed amen now we we can pray and ask God to to change things and that'll work and he but he knows that so you're not going to pull anything over on him you know to try to to do it don't worry about it just just keep believing it but see I believe in this hour that there is a predestinated people now when it will take place that is up to God that's his point but why can't we start confessing where we're at and what we're believing right amen we're not in today of Martin Luther we believe that thank God for the truth we believe that we're not in the days of John Wesley we're not in the days of isusa Street Pentecost we're not even in the days of when the prophet of God would be going through the land you know uh bringing the message we're in the days of the message see and really it I like the way that the scripture says the voice of the seventh angel see all right when he begins to to sound all right that was what he brought unto us but then when you and I begin to sound the same message then you can start depending on something to take place all right you say well we've been 40 years doing it well all right so what if we take one more or two more or 10 more what does it matter you know see everybody's saying well I just don't see this and I don't see that well open your eyes amen amen I'm going to make this statement and then I'm not trying to justify nothing justification doesn't have to be considered in the fact when you're talking about facts we are not in the days as I said of those coming down we're not in the days of the Great Book of Acts when that the Holy Spirit was scattering out and going forth and and you know and bringing the people we're in the days of the end Gathering right when that is supposed to come back to that original word amen when now if Satan was back there fighting them real hard on the days they were there don't you think he's going to be here fighting you and I and I've always said it then that way then Paul you couldn't bring Paul down here today he'd be in jail before night was over with cuz he you know he just he he'd have that mindset to where that he would just be really screaming and hollering and and and it wouldn't work so they can't take our place but we can't take their place they've done their part now we've got our part all right so we went through the scriptures that they without us cannot be made perfect so they're waiting on you and I and I believe that right but I believe God has predestinated a seed for the age that we're living a word right that you and I are to make that manifest and it is to go all the way into the change of the body see then that's predestinated now it's going to take place right was there any way that that that Noah would not build an ark no because it had already been said all right now but Noah had to work and build the ark y right it wasn't that that God said it and know here appears an ark out in the middle of the the deserts or somewhere you know and it just God just speaks it no somebody's going to have to make this word manifest that's right now that's the point I'm trying to make to you and I we have a word to be made manifest let's make it man and let's start talking about it you know let's don't just say well well I don't see nothing you ain't got nothing I ain't got nothing either well I differ with you I'm sorry I'm sorry you know I I believe the word is here to be made manifest it's our choice of what we do with it all right but we were talking about it I said now something predestinated for the time meaning that that there's no way to change it there's not enough devils in hell to be able to stop this bride of Jesus Christ in the last days from coming to the place that God said she'd come to right now if he hadn't said she'd come there right that's a different thing but the prophet of God said it will be here he said oh yes it will be because it's done been said all right so then we're walking in what is to do all right see we're not back there right after the time of the Prophet being on the scene we're here now amen we're in our part of the doings all right so everybody's waiting on you and I and that's what we'll get to in it but just keep in mind now what I'm saying we are predestinated to come to the place to fulfill the scriptures right the in this day that was not fulfilled has not been fulfilled until this day amen all right so we have a wonderful thing that we're we're sitting here with the word of God realizing that God has told us what we're doing right through by way of the prophet and then all we got to do is just walk there in all right but here's what I'll say this and then this evening I I'll get back to it but is I told him last night you can uh holler and scream all you want to you can talk about you know and I could call your name I could say now brother collie you're doing so and so quit well he might quit around me yeah right right but he's not going to quit until God comes on the scene and delivers him from that right that's right it just go under cover well see that's what people are what and I'm sorry I'm just plain language I talked that what that's what I see most of the preachers has done over the 30 40 years that we've been around they're trying to make converts by government of rules and regulations to try to get people to line up and not that won't work right it never has and it won't work now brother D you don't believe in living right now I believe in being born again I believe in letting God live and then we'll come out to the right place but see in that then that's why I Don't Preach like all of these others you know but don't think I don't believe in living right I believe in it but but I believe in it do from an inward experience coming outward and then you're not worried then that way I drank all the liquor I want to I run around all I want to I cuss and lie and cheat and steal all I want to because that want to when way right I'd rather deal with it that way than deal with it in any other form right amen but don't you ever think that you know that that Brother D because he don't speak out a lot about things don't believe in living right right amen I do I believe in in doing it cuz I I believe that if we don't live right there's something wrong with us and that's simple that's right you know I mean if you live like the devil you are the devil that's that's simple terminologies that's not that doesn't take a lot of of great Revelation you know that's we was last night talking about a lion tongues and things you know we went up to the to a fishing tournament there and the guy was telling us that all all fishermen are liars you know well I don't agree with that I'm like the old guy that said you know I killed 99 rabbits and the guy said well why my Lord I just told everybody I killed 100 he said why lie about one rabbit I mean we're not supposed to be Liars we're supposed to be Christians all right but now let's get on to it but see in this day now what I'm trying to say I got it wrote down here and underlined and everything else to try to make a point then we'll go in to doing it in this age we are predestinated unto the completion right now are you listening to the word I'm using the word completion which means bringing something to a finish all right we are to bring to a finish the stages of adoption right and if we don't believe it's in this hour surely we got to believe it's close right you know right and all the way to what to understand the Redemption of the body right just because you're adopted I'll make this point blunt it's because we're even adopted and understand the Redemption of the body that doesn't mean the body is redeemed right there no that's right that's why I'm calling it stages see growth development uh whatever you want to use to to to be able to understand cuz see I believe every age was predestinated now all the way through whether it would be Luther Wesley whatever it would be every age was predestinated to have and receive the new birth right amen because that would be the qualifications to get into the body of Christ amen you can't get into the body of Christ without being born again all right so then in that then every age would be predestinated to the New Birth amen but you and I are predestinated to bring forth the finality or completion of you know the the the stages and and the the things of adoption to to where that we can bring it into that point and if if I use the wrong word you make it right I'm you you understand what I'm saying right the said the prophet would say we believe in three steps of Grace and he said no it's not three steps of Grace he's he's he's a human being like me that's stumbling for words and things to try to say to get you to see because one person is saying steps another person stages another person this another person is that and that way your mind is being Twisted backwards and forth and and all like that but what I want to do now is just to start off so we we're just going to title this adoption for a while and it'll be basically adoption in three stages but I want us to just start off in the Simplicity of understanding and then that way we'll grow into the things and and you that you know uh have been around a long time by with us because remember other people are listening out there and I'm trying to make it as plain as I can but I believe too that we need to understand who we are that's my point is understanding who we are and what we're doing see we the the adoptions and the things to me has been made so big until it's made out there somewhere you know beyond what we can attain un to and I don't agree with that right I never have agreed with it I believe that if God says it we can attain unto it all right but see you you you'll turn around people will and they'll take the great things of the Bible and as I said a moment ago and they'll bring up Paul and Peter and and look what took place in the book of Acts yeah you know and wonderful it did we believe that right but the problem is they turn around and said I don't see it today see now what have you done right you planted a seed of ruination into the minds of people and you've made it to where that they can't accept what's going on that's right I'm as honest as I can believe you bring the book of Acts up here today and they would be they go Haywire CU brother brand said it I didn't he said the spirit that was back there to do those things is the same Holy Spirit living in you to manifest the hour that you're living did you hear me yeah the same holy spirit that justified the Lutheran Sanctified the Methodist baptized the Pentecostals is is Now setting an order the coming of the Lord he said it was the same Holy Spirit but yet we've lost the the point of of seeing something like it is and then when you try to express it oh you just you you're just trying to prop up something no no I don't believe it I'm just not telling you like I believe it you bring the book of ACT people right up here right now and let them live in this environment that you and I are living in and they'd say send me back to the book of Acts why because they fought two organizations we fight 969 that was a long time ago and about 10,000 in this message right I'm talking about in the message people right you don't have all they didn't have the doctrines the the existence and things that we have to fight daily through our mind as Satan coming in and and bringing up those things and and trying to dechristianize us in every form Paul would probably pull his hir out if he come up here and live for about a week and seen all the things if he was holling like he was back there even to turning over who philus hus even so strong he said I just turn you guys over to the devil you know what would he do today with all the doctrinal issues and the the situations of life that we're living in here and see people say oh you're just trying to make an excuse well what's your excuse come on you you people are glad to throw it my way but what's your excuse where are you at where's your manifestations I'll stand here all afternoon and not brag just tell the God's on truth that I can get amen out of the congregation of how that God has been been here with us and great things have taken place from the dead raised the sick healed all things we had people well I don't see nothing going on wake up what are you looking for it will never take place under that kind of a situation right see cuz you're looking for something that will not take place Jesus Christ could not heal in one city there he had to leave the city to heal somebody amen right and he was almighty God right amen you see we want to look for some kind of great manifestation the greatest manifestation that I can see anywhere is a group of people that are gradually slowly holding on and just staying with the word and and and battling out Satan over the word of the hour right sure we want to see the sick healed and the dead raised right we want to see those things right but if it's true that Jesus couldn't do a miracle because of their unbelief bring it down here today what would he be doing right that's right I S to see when I start talking like everybody thinks that I'm I'm trying to prop up I'm not trying to prop up nothing I'm telling it like it is where's your signs and wonders right I can stand here and talk about what God has done Among Us right amen but how many of you even think about those things well we just not seeing nothing bu sh people among us many are the afflictions of the righteous the Bible says that's right we're deteriorating but see I'm just trying to get a point we belittle our own selves and we let Satan get in their minds and and and torment us that's it amen right and tell us say well if if you got what you thought you had let's let's see this that the other right somebody's going to do that one these days you're going to get called down and I'm sorry and it won't be somebody with a sarcastic hateful attitude call you down it'll be somebody just standing there knowing the truth is the truth that's right brother R said there be Anan Safar laying all over the place now Peter and them wasn't sarcastic that caused ananas and shf fire but there was truth amen but they were standing on the word of the hour right all right but listen why can't we believe what God has said about us amen he's called us bright that's right he's called us wonderful marvelous he's called us beautiful am why can't we believe that right well if I just see something well you'll never see it t because that's your that's your way because God doesn't do it that way he's wanting to see who will stand with the word amen but see I believe everybody is predestinated according to for knowledge amen right right y but then when you go into for knowledge you must take another step from forn knowledge to come to the predetermining of the word or seed all right see he knows where to fall that's for knowledge but predetermining is the fact that he himself said it will take place right right right and there's the word of seed all right so this is the age amen this is the time to talk about adoption right because that's what the whole world's waiting on all right now you I know you don't like me and everything people don't but but I'm telling the truth it said the Lord Jesus went into a city couldn't even heal a person because of their unbelief bless God I go in and heal them all no no we don't go that way right I've been around long enough and people say I take every spirit in here under my control be careful y be careful right because Satan is not a bully that's right sure he's a bluff but it's kind of like old boy that we all know Billy free you know he'd run his mouth he'd run his mouth he always was lying like crazy and running his mouth and everything else but old boy done at work one day challenged him on something Little Billy just beat daylight side of him so he back up what he's talking about don't try you you better have the goods remember my point no person is a match for the devil right but the holy spirit in the least member right of the body of Christ is not just a match for the Devil he's the devil's master all right amen see then don't back down let's go on with it all right but we want to cover it see all right adoption they said we're going to talk about it in three stages and using it we're going to use the Lord Jesus as a background because that was the way that it was done by the prophet I wish that you would go there's probably at least 30 or 40 hear you hymns there's a lot of tapes called position in Christ there's messages called adoption there's all kind of things I wish you would go there we have books on it on adoption and everything I wish you would study that and listen to the prophet as he explains the things about adoption you know and to where that we can can get on with it all right now in doing that let's take as I said let's take it in three stages and we'll take it like the Lord Jesus all right now the Lord Jesus on the River Jordan was identified right that's where it said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell now don't go to the he ye him wait until a amount of transfiguration on that point but remember that he was recognized right there on the River Jordan we could read those scriptures but you can read them yourself as Matthew 3 all right he was recognized before the world as to be almighty God Amen this is my part of the earth the prophet said future home that I have redeemed and from this part of the earth I'll redeem the rest right there was all that we have need of right in Jesus Christ amen it was all that we have need of he was identified as what the Son of God Amen all right he was identified okay the world saw you know whatever was there and then it's recorded and put around the world and bibles have been written so the world has to witness that almighty God came down Y and verified that this was his son right not trinitarianism or nothing like that see it was God coming down himself but he identified him there and said this is my son in whom I'm pleased to dwell all right then the second stage would go over which would be manifestation or authority and that would carry you over to mount of transfiguration which would be Matthew 17 and then in that situ ation it shows him glorified now B to River Jordan he wasn't showed his glorified right man it's just identified right all right now are you listening right write it down see J down the little point so of what we're thinking on see first he was identified there was no uh great manifestations right he was just identified on the River Jordan a voice from Heaven see this is my beloved Son all but then when you come over to mount of transfiguration Matthew 17 then Jesus was glorified before him right the prophet of God said adoption glorifies Jesus Christ all right now and being glorified see then he comes out with full Authority right okay this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell hear ye him all right now I was just looking at it back there holyo it's reading I invite you to to go and read them and pay close attention to the things brother brandham says on it he said that when Jesus was on the River Jordan said he said what he says is what is said he said River Jordan see we won all of it flops over to Transfiguration no because he was a child of God right he was God made manifest in human flesh all right he had Authority he had uh you know manifestations before it come to amount of transfiguration right right matter of fact there's a whole lot more there before than there was cuz it only like three you know mostly 6 months or something or less from the time that he goes to Transfiguration he go straight to Calvary the biggest portion of the healings the signs and the Wonders was back in his early ministry right right in other words it even got to the basis and it looked like he was losing everything go back in his early Ministry where he could just speak it and this would happen or that would happen seemingly when it gets down to the later parts of of going towards Calvary that he look like he was losing things but yet that pointed I tried to make See You Don't See Jesus glorified on the on River Jordan right you see him identified amen right but when he come to the amount of transfiguration it showed him in his glorified State completion finished right there in him was everything right then he goes on and he's crucified right all right and then when he comes up the body raises so we'll get back to Romans and when we get to it you know about two we to understand the Redemption of the body right there his body was redeemed right not that it was sinful but because it had a beginning right and anything has a beginning has to have an ending to it see his body was not Eternal as he was dwelling on Earth all right now I know these are simple things but I'm just that's what I'm trying to do drop down now and then we'll go up gradually so be with us you know but you know I've always been one thing that I love to hear people talk about their experiences you know I sure do love to do water baptisms and things I love to do that and I love to to view things of where people are baptized and see things like that cuz I I can talk about your experience there cuz I had one of them you know that's where I can enjoy it so I don't I'm not so great revelated until I just go to sleep and I'll wake back up when brother Dale gets on up a few more stages you know and all CU I'm I'm so much far above that well I'm telling you right now then you're the one I'm talking about you're not above that if that's what you think that's right sorry that's right that's just the way it is we should be able to Rejoice with everybody all right but after the resurrection of the Lord Jesus you'll find him then in Matthew 28 right now after his resurrection you don't find a scripture that we quote a lot of times but you'll find it after the resurrection when Jesus said all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me right amen that's after the resurrection right but we quoted as he had all power and authority right the city couldn't heal because of this the unbelief he had to put people out that's right because of the unbelief right but you don't hear him after the resurrection having to put nobody out right amen then so then in the minute the life the ministry and the things of the Lord Jesus then we see the three stages that we talk about in adoption identification he was identified as a child of God all right then coming to full Authority or manifestation of hear ye him on the Mount of transfiguration and then coming up to a change of the body bringing it to a position to where that then he would say all power in Heaven and Earth is now given unto me amen after his resurrection all right now see then doing it like this now let's take ourselves let's take ourselves all right through these things that we talk about you know and see if we can see in ourselves the things that took place in the ministry of the Lord Jesus and remember see here's where everybody's at this this is what and I'm sorry I just I'm blunt and I'm I'm I know it but see that's where people say well I like to see you do what brother random done I can't do it and you can't either right amen so don't toach your horn see you run around oh brother Dale think he's something let's see him do what the prophet done well let's see you do what the prophet done of course nobody ain't going to listen that way they're going to get yeah that's right that's right y y yep that's no garbage can that's that running mouth we talking last night the lying tongu and the things we're talking about right it's really easy to brag right until you stand in front of somebody that's got the goods right right you know you you really brag what standing for somebody's got the goods you see them shut up up I'm just I know it I know I shouldn't be that point but my point is we're down here a long way it's 40 years after the the going away of the Prophet what are you looking for what are you looking for to take place to bring about a resurrection and a Rapture and how many definitions would we get I love what brother R said he said God is not going to send the headstone because of your merits he said he will send it because he promised it because there's no merits in any of us for anything that's right why are we think we're so much greater than any of the other churches around there's only one difference and that's the holy Holy Spirit and they have the anointing that a lot of times makes us ashamed of ourselves right but then they turn down the word so you know there's something wrong right all right so give me the word Oh Brother D you're just word word word will you tell me what it's supposed to be there one thing about it you can't say about this old boy you're looking at those on the internet don't know it but the people around here had one been around you know this old boy's never been down about what God has done right most people are looking for what God will do right I look back and see what God has done and I stand on what God has done the things that we've seen him do right and in that way see now I'm not trying to be rid of ROM but who are you you know I got in trouble about that being say uh you're not Jr and I'm not Sue Ellen I got in trouble that years ago trying to explain something about it but it's a plain honest truth people want to run their mouth would you let them get in front of somebody that really knows what you're talking about amen that's right oh yeah they'll shut up then see cuz they know right but now my point of what Jesus went through three stages identification Authority or manifestation when he come to man of transfiguration brother Brandon said simply in plain language he said God said I'm backing off if you hear anything you'll get it from him that's why there was a not a lot said between Mount of transfiguration and Calvary there was not a lot said right read your Bible right it covers it real quick why because was God stepped back and said if you hear anything you'll get it there that's to me when brother randam come to his ministry there in 63 in the opening of the seals that was to me was the ministry of the Prophet right everything got real quiet except what he was saying right amen that's right and the only way we can hear from God is to hear it through that man amen I've said that and I don't back up right you said well so and so I don't care about so and so tell me what the word says right the man brought us the message that's right but it's up to us to get into the message and live the message not just talk about a message but become the alive word upon Earth that's all I've ever said it we're supposed to do but in point in doing that what are we looking for to take place that's on me so forgive me I mean what are we looking to take place why can't we talk about what God has done amen why can't we talk about what God has done Among Us amen is it exalted to tell the truth what you see no no people don't want to hear it like that right why because their preachers in their pull pits is blinded them to the point of what the truth really is Right amen and and see it's not that way but see Jesus was identified and to do that you know what he had to have now let's see if we can say we've been through these stages all right but I'll just take a little bit at your time and we'll go along and then just the next message will be a continuation but see Jesus went to River Jordan right now where was there any sick healed and dead raised and manifestation right right you got one man standing there which was John the Baptist that said he saw it and it was not necessary did anybody else see it right right it's not recorded that Millions stood by and saw all these things that's right it's only recorded that John saw the Spirit descending that's right so we got John's word that's right and we got the word of God that would speak from you know God's word speaking from Heaven that this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell amen no sick heel no dead rais I hope you're listening right but he had to be baptized right why did Jesus have to be baptized we've been through that right the prophet's been true that he explained it right the sacrifice had to be washed all right so having to be washed he had to be baptized he said it's natural that I be baptized with the you know why comest down to me he said let's just fulfill all righteousness let's do what the Bible said amen right right and we know that he did not have to receive the new birth right he was the new birth that's right amen but he went through as an example for you and I that's right amen and see publicly he was baptized by the only man that was capable of doing it amen that's right right right a fuzzy bearded old man standing out in the water with long hiring and old sheep skin wrapped around him why wasn't Kus brought out to baptize Jesus right amen why wouldn't all them great leaders you know let me I want supposed to do let me go bti no no the only man that could have baptized the only man that could identify right was John the Baptist you age y right all now what about our water baptism right I remember brother dick years ago has asked me a question that's when we first started talking he said is is is water a baptism essential I thought for a minute and I thought well I've got to have an answer this is what I said I said the truth is you can say well can you get in the Kingdom well this man on the cross got in the kingdom and this one see you just argue all about it that don't influence me at all do you think you can get into the kingdom of God without being baptized now we're not talking about the thief on the cross right okay right we're not talking about that the Holy Ghost and it can fall on people before they're baptized right right but you tell me it fell on somebody and then they refused to go get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I'll tell you you're a liar and that other person's a liar right CU I don't agree with it right see the Bible tells you how to get into the Kingdom right repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin see because that's your identification right amen you said but now no now he was a son all right we good going get to that okay don't worry about it don't get ahead of me just follow me see he had to be baptized to prove that he was the sacrifice that's right are you listening yes your baptism don't save you right but without it you can't have salvation right right no problem is it right now get what I'm talking about it was part of Jesus's identification that he be washed right in a baptism y it's part of our identification for us to be washed in water in a baptism amen it don't make us no the children of God right no it's an answer of a good conscience all right see now you got the people you know that believe this water baptism under regeneration Stu we don't believe that but we believe that water baptism is essential right to those that know the truth Amen to be able to receive salvation right so now his water baptism didn't make him a child no right you follow me it was part of his identification as a child the holy spirit that came down upon Jesus on the River Jordan never made him a child of God that's where your River Jordan people where they're going that's their business it never made him a child of God right amen he was born a child of God Amen this day in the city of David is born a savior which is Christ the lord it didn't make him a savior it didn't make him a a child of God it just identified him before the world right see other words here he is all right now your baptism doesn't save you and it does not make you a child of God right it only identifies you right why wouldn't you want to be identified that's right to me it's like a woman going down and want to get married to a man and then she wants to keep her m and d That's garbage can to me that's right I ain't going to do it I'm not going to marry somebody like that I just want to do it you can do what you want to that's your business you you're you're you're left in your world I'm in mine but I'm not going to do it cuz you're not identified right marriage identifies you y you ever look up you ever looked up the definition of adoption or adopt then you wonder why I'm talking about marriages or something like that see when you're baptized in water you're taking on his name amen right amen you're testifying to the world Amen that you you've left your old husband he's dead amen that's right and you're going to be married to Jesus Christ right right and you come out to be a spouse right have you ever looked up adopt adopt is is to take a take by choice into a relationship to take my choice into a relationship to take voluntarily a child of other parents as one's own child right the word adopt means to choose sure choose you this day who you that's right it means to embrace now think about you word a baptism come on right you know that the word adopt means to a spouse I just wrote this out of Webster so if you argue with him you know amen let's read what it says on strong strong concordance about adoption to adopt adoption of children adoption of sons adoption of Dos of his sons that relationship you don't have it in your notes at all right that relationship which God has was pleased to establish between himself and the Israelites in preference to all other nations right now he adopted them right right they become a spous the nature and condition of the true disciples in Christ who by receiving the spirit of God into their souls become sons of God it's also in it also includes the Blessed State look for for in the future life after the visible return of Christ from Heaven A spous engaged right right see when you went down in the water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you were supposed to die thank the Lord that's right right amen amen right and I like what that that brother in Germany said that time he said he said when we baptize them said we want them to have their mouth wide open he said cuz that's the first thing it needs to be clean and I hollered amen when he said of course he was talking about it like 15° you know and you know you know see your water baptism has a lot more to do with it than just your thinking about it well just way we we sure we going down today and get dumped but R sit turn and go back you're not worthy that's right Jesus was identified by his baptism y then a voice from heaven right identified him before the world as his child right but you know he's always a child right man why because he was God right now if you were listening to what the definition of adoption gave to whereby that God adopted Israel out of all the nations of the world he chosen he adopted him he espoused him to himself did you're peculiar people see your water baptism shows to the world that you've taken on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen right and see you you want to do it secretly because you don't want nobody to be around then don't ask me to do it CU that's you know I'm sorry because I don't like it that way I like for you to just be straight and honest and when brother dick and them came up years ago to be baptized and sister Gail she said well well brother they said uh I'm going to be baptized too I said well great cuz I was only dependent on baptizing brother dick and brother Al and you know I said well that's great that's great she said yeah I'm going to get baptized cuz my husband wants me too I said I won't baptize you that's what I say but we talked on for a little while and I looked at her and grinned and I said sister you're not pulling nothing over on me I said you really see it she said yes I said okay I'll baptize you she might have been in honor of husband and all that sure that's wonderful that's great but I want you know that's right you to understand that your baptism was a day that men not more to you than you ever thought about it meant a day that you was identified right and you took on his name right amen and you know what that is that's adoption but see we think oh it's got to be this it's got to be that no it's simply something you're going through amen right right and we've been going through it a long time amen that's right but you see everybody wants to look at something out there we're no more than what it used to be and I'm not throwing off on nobody but the old good old Baptist Doctrine one of these days we're going to get up to heaven I don't know whether I'm saved or not but one of these days I'll know I'm saved well they were just speaking what they believed in their mind but I thought we were supposed to know we're saved right I thought we're supposed to know something about it all right but now listen so then you water a baptism is when you were identified right so you started your adoption Y no now brother Dale I got the quotes where the okay I gave you the quotes and I got plenty more we know the whole story and we know that your new birth is not your adoption I'd be glad to give you those quotes that's right because it's not the adoption for this age this age is the change of the body amen right the finish the authorities Etc we'll get through those things just don't run ahead but see you got to start somewhere now how did you ever become a child of God how did you become a child well I always was I I'm I born a Son of God so was everybody in the world that's right that's everybody in the world was born the son of God right or a daughter of God because God is the only one that can give life but that don't give you eternal life just because that you are a child of God God is the only creator of Life Satan cannot give your soul he can't do those things he can only pervert right so every person that's born into the world is a child of God by natural birth because God gave us life amen all right right so now that solves that problem so we're all a child of God by natural birth all right but now that's why Jesus told Nicodemus he said you must be born again he said yeah but my natural birth made me a Son of God he said you don't get in the Kingdom I'm talking about right with that form of terminology right you got to be born again amen man see then had he made it to theost he'd been all right right okay but now listen to what I'm trying to say you said but I was born the child of God that's in the message now see I always was eternal and and all this that and the other that's that's up to them you know say I believe you must receive eternal life I'm just sorry that's the way I believe it amen if you don't believe it turn your computer off click it off it don't it won't give me one dime and help me no popularity just you know forget it you don't listen to somebody else listen to them but if you want to talk about the truth so I believe in an oldfashioned form of Salvation amen that's right I believe you must be justified right right I believe you must repent of your sins and be that chopped off your pie sins and you must re then by doing that you must go to the water and get baptized and if you refuse to get baptized your repentance is not genuine right right amen that's how I believe then you must continue on to a state of sanctification the cleansing and setting aside amen and then you must receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that baptism of the Holy Ghost makes you a child of God in the kingdom of God you're not talking about just sunship because of creation you're talking about a new creation you're talking about being born again in the body of Jesus Christ see because we get into scripture you go through all if you want to in Ephesians let's read just a little bit in Ephesians 2 let's see let make sure scripture yeah two all right let's see what Paul thought about us verse one and you have he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sin oh I always was eternal I just feel it what he said well Paul says you were dead in trespasses and sin right all right says we in time pass you walked according to the course of this world Amen now you remember that yeah right according to the prince of the power of the iron now who's the who's the prince of power that's Satan the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience in other words the same thing that's in the children of Disobedience Within You and I right Paul as we were talking about last night said that there was murderers adulterers wh mongers all kind of things read there in the scripture and he said and such were some of you that's right but said now you are clean amen mean why cuz you're born again right right amen among whom also we all and I got a great big square around mine right there had our conversation in 's P in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others but Paul you ain't never heard brother brandham brother Bram said always was eternal so I tell you what brother BR said I ain't listen to you Paul preach brother right is that the way people are oh my now if brother Brown was contrary to Paul then Paul was wrong and brother Brown's wrong or both of them was wrong right cuz they both can't be right if they're in opposite direction right that's just blunt and plain language right all right drop on down where we get the sa but look at verse 11 wherefore remember that ye being in times past Gentiles In the Flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called a circumcision the flesh made by hands that at that time you were without Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of Promise having no hope and without God right in the world now what is it I got it in here right somewhere Galatians I think where is the one where it says in adoption pertained unto Israel see we have no right right now I want to finish that up in just a few minutes of just talking about that and we'll just stay right here on this see we we haven't talked about the New Birth now we're just talking about water baptism and things we're going through see then the children of Israel had to be chosen yep right everybody was a child of God by natural creation right but God chose a group of people Y and connected himself to that and called him his wife right or his people or his children he adopted them y right he chose him he chose Israel he adopted Israel but see you and I didn't even have any right of that that's what Paul's explaining right we were Gentiles no whatsoever the adoption was what was pertaining to Israel in other words Israel should have went on through in the fact of receiving Jesus Christ as their savior the new birth and then should have went on to mount of transfiguration experience and then went on to the change of the body y but they turned it down right it become a gentile dispensation right now not every Jew turned it down right that's why it's called a gentile dispensation which it means All Nations but Israel as a whole rejected Jesus Christ amen even rejected this sunship adoptions and things right it was pertaineth unto them we were aliens that's right Y and didn't come up with that new word in Ni last days you know talking about illegal aliens and aliens from outter space and and this that and the other that was in the Bible right and you look up back there and you find out illegal aliens means somebody is here illegally and that's why they call them an alien you know or or an alien from out of space means they're not from here so then Israel was an a I mean we were an alien Gentiles right we had no promise right nothing pertaining to the Gentiles right but God true Mercy if you went on reading below there thank you Lord amen gave us an opportunity right to be able to come become the children of God Amen to be able to be born again that would make us a child of God and if you're not born again you're not a child of God right I don't care how much you claim church I don't care how much you claim how good you are whatever all that's wonderful all that's well and good but Nicodemus had every bit of that almighty God said you got to go down you under yep in other words let me say this and we'll finish you Nicodemus come the way I've come right was that what he saying to him come the way I've come right Nicodemus are you willing that's like I said it's not written in the Bible all the things that take place right right reckon it could have been Jesus said Nicodemus what you need to do first maybe after Nicodemus got through saying you mean I got to go back to my mother's W I got to do this that and the other and Jesus said Nicodemus what I need to do said you need to meet John the Baptist now hey I know the story by then he was already crucified don't get be garbage okay get to Point Jesus could have said to Nicodemus what you need to do is meet me down to water right in front of everybody down there on River streets you know right in the middle of Ohio River you know or something where be right out in the public you know and said we'll we'll start you off in the right way said we'll baptize you Nicodemus went away rejected that right right right so he wouldn't follow it what about you and me what about our word baptism I've baptized a lot of people over because that they said to me and they come along later in life and say brother Dale I really don't I really didn't uh understand about baptism I just done it because everybody else was doing it right you know I just done it because it maybe the preacher told me I needed to do it well I've baptized a lot of people over again right and I'm like this if you were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ but believing that your water baptism was under regeneration like the people that baptized they people baptized in the name of Jesus Christ even Lord Jesus Christ and believing that your water baptism is under regeneration I'm just as honest as it can be if I was you I'd get baptized again right brother asked me that question one time and I answered it I I said what was your Doctrine he said we believed in water baptism under regeneration I said I would if I was you I'd go get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and get away from that Doctrine right well I don't believe the doctrine no more no no but my identification right that's it you see I want to be identified with Jesus Christ my brother come down through there one day and was baptizing a bunch of people he said you ought to be ashamed of yourself baptizing them people and he wasn't he wasn't sarcastic he wasn't he was no racist or nothing but it's just what he said he said you baptizing them black people he said there coming out of that water white as could be he said that froze to death I said yeah but we was doing it and he wasn't throwing off on Races he wasn't that way he was just saying here I am right you are right out there doing that why don't you come down here and get some church and do it they wouldn't do it back then you know right I mean you going to go down to Baptist Church and ask permission to use your baptistry going to baptize the people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you're not going to get in there that's just plain language you just might as well go get you River and take care of it but you see I want to be identified right I'm like Martin Luther they said Martin Luther don't you know that the whole world is against you he said I want the whole world to know that I'm against them but I'm trying to get you to see the Simplicity of the life and journey now listen I'll keep repeating this okay your life and your journey in travel is what God is looking at and why can't we believe that we've come through these things we want to make statements you know and I was looking today in there and we say in adop brother Rand will say so your children are out there wearing shorts so well they wasn't Christians see we like to do that don't we you know he said there Christians you going have to argue with him well you believe you can go out no that's we're different now but you know there was a time back there when you done a lot of things that you claimed a new birth and you done a lot of things that you don't do now right well did you become a Christian later or was you a Christian brother Brandon was a straight honest man he said your Christians are going out here forming organizations pulling apart and dividing now I'm quoting him cuz I was just looking at it he said the the congregational Hess he said they had the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said the Church of God he said they had the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said the Oneness had the baptism of the Holy Ghost you see yeah but I just don't see how they that's what I'm saying you're you're taking your own intellectual conception and not looking at the children of God and just remember there is no big sin and little sin so if we're going to dechristianize everybody then we'll have to dechristianize ourselves first he said well they didn't come on to the message well now if they didn't come on the message they prove what they had right exactly right amen right that's why I love what the prophet had to say one day and it really struck me I knew where the bad just laid in the lines back there and the days and hours they lived their doctrines and ideas but as long about somewhere in the late 50s or might be even early 60s he said the Baptist is just now become a denomination and I thought Lord I thought it was a couple hundred years ago but you see when they turn down his message right they all become denominations they died when they turned down his message there was honest hearted people still in there until he come along with it so when the prophet says that they're Christians you got to say they're Christians just say what he says they're Christians but then we prove what we are cuz we don't go on with the truth we just take it stages of your adoption and we just talking about water baptism but you know that's something I've lived through come on brother that's something we've all lived through right right right amen and you know God looks back there and he's pleased with that see we won we won't take that and bring it down to ourselves where it says this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell we want all of this big thing well be under but we don't look at it as simple life that we're living right what's keeping you from going out into the world today let's thing that's right what's keeping you from going out in the world of sin today I thought it baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right I thought it was Christ in you the hope of glory of what was doing it I thought that's what led us here you and then we don't think something's been going on see we're always looking forward or Looking Backward we can look backward and we can see brother branam and we'd say oh if we just had it like that and look forward out there and oh one of these days we get into Glory and fail to see what's going on I want to make adoption so simple until we can see that that's what's taking place something has been taking place right we're in a process amen sure I'm not where I want to be but I'm not where I used to be and just move on what we got 129 anybody have need you have a need come and let's believe have you been bed into the body bed with the there is one way to enter in it in the church Tri God has been doing something but did we recognize it do we recognize what he been doing you been getting the people ready right what do we believe our brother needs a physical touch and we believe right here is the spot right okay let's believe it Lord Jesus thank you Father for manifesting your word thank you for being what you are and Lord just help us now as we would Lord be able to you and to move on in you thank you for touching our brother because we believe it and this prayer cloth is a contact to believe it we thank you Lord we leave we we just lay it all into your hands and we believe you in Jesus name anybody else in have a need before we go anybody else are you the church Tri are you in the and forever they were in Father you heard our sister Lord we believe and thank you Lord as this PR go and be with the children be with them in school the place Lord just help them let them see you be with each one of us Lord we love you in Jesus anybody El for do you believe let accept what God has done and let's see
