========================================

Ministry later on when he when when the discernment began he go he related it back he says well this is the same way that God was there speaking to to Abraham and Sarah and so he and he refers back to that a number of times right and then he basically began to step into that Ministry and then later on he began to he he preached in I think it was in ' 63 he he preached the the church ages and it was after that I think it was the angel spoke to him and says now you read Malachi 4 and I think at that point in time then he realized he was the messenger to this age and he stepped into that office if you will and then when you come to the time of this seals he realized no I am the Messenger and I have been given a message and that message is to forerun the second coming of Jesus Christ and he and he says I have to be obedient to that message and he stresses that over and over and over again after the seals well he had to step into his office as he progressed time well where are we we are the bride we've been sitting under the ministry of a prophet we've been sitting under and where God is actually trying to speak to the bride and tell her this is who you are this is what you are and we have to we have to Mo move from the lady you see in church age we have to move and come up higher as as John was spoken to come up higher come into the place where the revelation of the word come into the revelation of the seven seal come into the revelation of who you are because now we have to step into the revelation of Who We Are that's right we no longer can just church is not more than a Sunday morning social function no we have to become the message the message have to be something we read or something we hear no we have to literally become what God says that we are we have to become the message for this hour and so here again like I say this this is a step that we have to take but it t it takes a change in our thinking yes because then you you go into denominational systems and they remind you no you're just a sinner saved by grace no this message tells me I am a Son of God who had been fully restored to my position with my father and if I have been fully restored to my positions my father I have the rights of of of of a sunship and and and that but then now it's coming to the place where we have to come to adoption that's right where it's no longer just learning how to do and learning how to do and learning how to do but now all of a sudden we've been taught and taught and taught now it's time for us to practice what we' what we have been taught you you take a person that goes to medical school yeah they teach you all the theory and they teach you this and they teach you all that but all of a sudden now you have to stand before a person and you have to diagnose you have to take all of that training and all of that knowledge and you have to apply it to the situation that you're at because now you are the responsible for that life well we have heard the message over and over and over again now we are responsible to take this message and live it brother Ram in one place he says the people in in uh in in Wesley's time he says they took his message and they lived it they became living Epistles read of all men so whenever some people see us now what should we be we should be the living examples of this message whenever they look at us they should be able to see the message and manifestation in in in our lives it goes in Revelations 4:1 after this I looked and behold a a door was open in heaven and and a voice which I heard from the trumpet speaking with me come up hither I'm going to show you some things we know that the door is Jesus Christ so we at the the world is sitting in lady OA they're stuck there no but we are called to come higher we have to go through the door we have to be in Christ and one what what what what did John know he went up into the heavenlies and there all of a sudden the word was being open to them the word was be Reeve was being revealed to them when we look at the seals all of a sudden brother Brown says the book became a totally new book to him because no long because he could go back and he could see the types he says well this this is the same way that God did here this same way that God did there and therefore he could take this and this and this and this and he could pull them all together see because it's the same spirit it's the same way that God has been working all the way through so he could relate things that before he couldn't relate well now it has to come down unto us we have to be able to take the message we have to take the word of God and we have to go through the word of God and brother Brown we have to find oursel in that word and when we find oursel in that word and we can see that God always operated this way and this way and this way well God never changes well if God never changes and we approach God in the same way then God will have to operate through us the same way that he did back in there Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so in two or three agree that's touching any one thing if we ask God and God's presence is there then we know that God has already heard us and then we expect the results I mean what when we pray what do we expect why pray if you don't expect it I mean like one person said why worry if if you're going to worry don't pray but if you pray don't worry I mean this is where it comes down but see this has has to be a reality to us it has to be more than just words it it changes our whole concept our whole way of thinking like I said let this mind be in you which was also in Christ he knew who he was he knew he was God expressed in human flesh well what are we amen we are now God expressed in human flesh all that God was he pour into Christ everything that Christ was he pour into the church and therefore for the church the the bride has become the full manifestation of God upon the face of this Earth this is who we are amen this is Who We Are right we have to accept this we have to look beyond our flesh we have to look beyond our shortcomings we have to look beyond our carnality we have to look at all all the mistakes we make like somebody says you know what's the biggest mistake you made well this morning was getting out of bed okay but we have to come to the place where where literally the word becomes such a reality to us until we actually step into him and then we allow him to lead and to guide and direct us through the life that we live I know there are times I get up up in the morning since I'm retired my time is my own um but I also find out all a sudden I get up in the morning and I have my day planned out and all of a sudden we get a phone call and all of a sudden that takes care of that day you know God had something else in mind or we go someplace else and all of a sudden something else comes up and say well Lord obviously you have something else planned for me today just just lead me on but it's learning to follow the leading right I know when we're in India you know it's when I in the states I figure I have control of what I'm doing I'm I'm under that delusion but when I go into India I realize I'm totally I have no control over anything all of a sudden something will come up and well you have to deal with it all of a sudden we're going to go here instead of here well okay Lord what are you wanting us to do and then situations arise people who need to want to be prayed for and all of a sudden the the the whole everything just changes and so if well Lord obviously you have a different plan than what I have so Lord I have to follow your leading well now we have to do that even even you know just just here in the states we have to we have to be willing to be led by God I think I might have quoted this in in morning he says and the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church they'll have to be a sheave waved again in the last days well that's what when when you look at brother bram's Ministry that was the sheave that was Jesus Christ's coming and so expressing him self through the ministry of brother brandom it what was the whole thing it's to it's to show that the F the the full maturity of the word and its full power has been restored to the bride amen that means all of the power of God has been given to us there's no there there it's not you know we're not going to give you a little here and a little there no you have access to everything that's right but it takes the faith of it had it takes faith in God to operate that gift it takes the faith of God to actually believe believe that whatever he said that is true but too often we we we we we we we we will not grasp hold of the fact we we lack the faith because we look at ourselves it's not about us it's never been about us it's always been about him brother Brandon realized it's not what I do it's what I allow God to do through me he says I have to take myself and I have to submit myself totally unto the will of God so that God can actually speak through me and God can lead me and God can guide me and God can have do the different things that he does he says the things you just see on the platform he says this is nothing compared to what I have in real life all of a sudden God will tell me I want you to go to such and such a city I want you to be at a certain street corner at such and such a time somebody's going to come this is the way they're going to be dressed they're going to have this problem and this problem and this problem I want you to pray for them and then I want you to leave and so they he would go there he would be on the street corner something the person would come along he would pray for them and no soon as he was done praying he would he he would he would exit he never stuck around for a thank you come on he never stuck around for him to be glorified oh my brother Brandon prayed for me all a sudden they look around well where's this guy he did not want them to recognize him they wanted to recognize Jesus Christ they wanted to give the glory to Jesus Christ for the healing they wanted to acknowledge that Jesus Christ was the one that provided for their needs and this is the way it comes with us when when any time that we take ourselves and try and build ourselves up we're doing wrong it's not about us everything points back to Jes Jesus Christ brother Bram he says I wish the brother brandom Tabernacle was not named brother brandom Tabernacle I wish there was no you know there was nothing to remind the people of who I am he says I want people to see Jesus Christ well that's what we're supposed to be doing we're supposed to be having Jesus Christ live his life out through us that it's no longer us living but now it's God living his life through us and that way God gets all the glory amen so the full maturity of the word has been turned back to us in its full power if you believe that then use it but it's not for you to use for yourself right it's for you to use so God can be glorified like I mentioned I think earlier I say brother bradam he he says oh yeah bring the hard cases bring the deaf and the dying and the Blind and all this other kind of stuff and he says and and the angel says don't you do that he says I God placed that gift in you for God to use well why is the power of God residing in you so God could use the power so God could be glorified so God could exalt himself it's also you know when I was looking at different things when when when you begin to to look at at how Jesus Christ in his ministry there there was one man he was born blind right that man had to be blind for so be a number of years so Jesus Christ could come along and give him his sight amen why then so he could testify to the San hadrin Jesus Christ is God nobody else can do this but him so he had to live his life in blindness up until that point and we'll say God can come along and and and could pray for them and give them man his sight so that he could testify before the sanh we don't understand the things going on in our life why did Esther have to be all being taken away from her uncle and and go into you know be part of the herum of of of of the king so that she could become the queen so then all of a sudden persecution came to the Jewish people all of a sudden she was in a position to save her own people you look at Joseph in his life what had happened God given him dreams oh yeah my brothers are going to bow down to me even my parents are going to bow down unto me how is this going to be taking place he had to be sold into slavery yes he had to be put into prison and he had to sit in that prison until all of a sudden Pharaoh had a dream and then all of us oh yeah I remember yeah there was me and you you didn't like the cook so you killed the cook and you let me live but yeah this guy interpreted this dream he had to be in a particular prison he couldn't just be in any prison he had to be in the particular one and then all of a sudden Pharaoh called him up and says oh interpret the dream he did and that's when all of a sudden his his brothers and stuff came and they had to bow down before but he had to go through all of that in his life to bring him to that point in his life where the vision that God had given or the dream that God had given him could come to its fulfillment well can you look back in your life why are you where you are how how did God direct your life to bring you to the places where you're at because God wants to fulfill something it's not just so that we can sit there and enjoy life or do whatever we're doing no he has a purpose for us being alive he has a purpose for us being here he has elected us for this generation they tell me in running a race he says they always in a relay race they save the best for last because he has to make up for he or she has to make up for the for the for the the the the lack of spe in the other other ones we're the best we have to finish the race if we don't finish the race nobody else can come they all those that have gone on before us they they won't receive their Eternal reward they won't okay so we have to finish this race what is US finishing the race we have to become the maturity we have to be the bride we have to be the bride manifested we have to sit there we have to be the final voice to the final age we have to be the fin manifestation of God in this generation because so the God can be glorified we are in Satan's Eden we stand out as a sore thumb because what's going on even Even in our nation he says they don't like Christianity they're doing everything they can against Christianity and when we're here all of a sudden if we challenge them all of a sudden we're you know we're caught taken before the magistrates and all the other kind of stuff because they don't like Christianity they're against everything that Christ stood for and so we are here and we are witnessing be by the lives that we live and the things which we do are we are witnesses to the people that we go around the people we do our business with they have their notice something's different about you I I I know I I know my wife she worked as a doula she it's a it's a labor support person and uh she worked for a number of years in a hospital there and um all of a sudden a lady would come in and she was having difficulty um and so all of a sudden surley would look at the situation quietly she would just pray and all of a sudden whatever the situation was it just changed and the nurses and says You Prayed didn't you well yeah that's why I'm here that's right well I mean but you know mean there were Miracles performed because she was there so that the women at the breach was if the B baby was breach birth or something else or some other problems or things which were going on simply because she was there she could intercede for the patient which was there and by interceding all of a sudden everything changed well we when we come up and and somebody comes to us and wants prayer do you believe in your prayer if you believe in it then God will act upon it but if you if you're just praying a prayer just to pray a prayer you might as well save your breath but if you can actually enter into the spirit of Christ and you can actually begin to enter into the suffering if you can enter into their feelings that they have all of a sudden oh this is going to be different because then it's no longer you now it's God working through you it's God ministering through you and then they'll all of a sudden then they'll give glory to God I know she she's not going to like me for this there was a lady my wife does alterations for periodically this one lady came on in and she brought something to be altered and and she said oh man I'm suffering terrible headache so Shirley says Okay so so surely put her hands prayed for her and then started doing the alteration stuff and a few minutes later they says my headache's all gone sure it had to go amen I mean I don't know how else to explain it if I pray I expect it if she prays she expects it well if we are expecting it and we believe it's it's God anointing us to do what we're doing then why not expect it and if we expect it then we expect autom make the the outcome of of whatever it is we we prayed for amen right Paul in in in this in the what we read in the in in the in Hebrews here Paul is referring to the children of Israel as they were delivered from Egypt and it's interesting when you begin to look at them all of a sudden here was God God sent Moses now Moses God had ordained to be the deliverer for the children of Israel um he tried it and his own efforts and he failed he had to run out of town he had to protect him you know save his own life he T and the way brother brandom explains it brother um God gave him a hot-tempered wife to kind of bring him down a few notches to the place where he could no longer speak he could no longer have a confidence in himself he would stutter and um he went out to the to the goats just to get away from household things and uh but God had to bring him to the place I mean Moses was raised in all the the knowledge of the Egyptian he was being trained to be the next Pharaoh he had to be able to lead an army he had to be able to stand and and if you're going to lead an army you have to stand there and have confidence of where you're taking them and otherwise they're not going to follow I mean I was in the military I I learned that a long time ago you got somebody well I maybe we should maybe we shouldn't I'm not sure we should no no I ain't going to follow him but all of us sudden s we got to we're going to take this hill we have the power we have we have this we have that and he saids come on man let's go okay by that by the enthusiasm yeah we'll we'll charge up the mountain because there's somebody we have a leader in front of us as all of a sudden we have confidence inen well what we have to have confidence in our God people had to have confidence in Moses if he was going to lead the children of Israel out but God had to reduce him to the place where Moses could no longer even had confidence in himself but then at the burning bush all of a sudden that all chain because all of a sudden he met something would take the gift which God had placed in him from the beginning and he would take that gift and he would activate it for lack of a better word so when he went back into Egypt what did he do he all of a sudden he says God has sent me here to lead you out out of this out of out of Egypt and then God performed Miracles through him so people could have faith why did God send the prophet me what what we were in denominational system what the denominational system they had a theory of God they had a theory oh yeah God God used to do this and God used to do that and we know God you there there was healing yeah we can read in the Bible that God did healing here and God did Miracles here but all of a sudden when God came and brother brand and all of a sudden that we saw the Miracles and the manifestation like one Minister said all of a sudden God was updated he became a reality God became more than something just a theory God was more than just the spirit that floats Around Here There and Everywhere else no all of a sudden God became a reality to him amen well when I was uced to this message I mean I was raised in a Baptist Church yeah they hear stories but all of a sudden in brother Brown's life all of a sudden there there's Miracles I mean this is book of Acts again I mean this is goes back to Jesus Christ This goes back back into the Bible this goes back into the reality that God is actually real well if God Is that real and God Is that real to him now we have to take that same God and have me real in us because if you leave it all on the prophet it does you no good that's right right but all of a sudden when you can take what the God that was in him and place that same God in you and begin to realize God is the same yesterday today and forever then all of a sudden that God becomes a reality to you and the more you walk with him the more of a reality he becomes I mean we've seen situations in our in there there was one situation that we were at in India just to give you an idea um I'm always punctual that's bad habit but that's just the way I am and we were sitting there and and the brothers were yeah they they like to eat so they ate and they kept eating and we we were leave we left about a 2 hours later than we should have to go to the next meeting which made me all all upset and then we get into the to this Village we were at and here again I mean we were late and I was mad I'm being honest with y'all and all of a sudden this guy jumps out in front of the car stop stop emergency emergency I figured great we're already late what are we going to do now here's this guy what's going on so they led us down this Alleyway Last House on the Left we entered into this into the little Hut and all of know was this girl probably mid 20s and I looked at her and I figured what's the deal going on well some Minister had told her you have an evil Wicked spirit because your husband and your children had died and you have to fast for 40 days in order for this evil spirit to leave they don't have the mass they don't have what it would take to fast for 40 days this girl me obedience to what this man had said she tried that she got to the place where all of her systems were beginning to shut down her her liver and her kidneys and all the other kind of stuff they finally took her to the hospital and they looked at her and says she's Beyond hope there's nothing we can do for her and I looked at the situation I says and all of a sudden I when I prayed I says Lord don't look at the stupidity of the of the ACT but look at the sincerity of her heart and give her her life back from that point on her systems rejuvenated and she I think she Liv for about two or three years after that nice strong healthy young woman it's not about me but I mean my mental condition was anything but prayer but yet God intervened because he had a need and he wanted to use me in that position to sit there and Speak Life back into that young lady so God you don't know the situation that you're going to be in you don't know all of a sudden you might end up in a situation where all of a sudden there's an emergency and God wants to use you to pray the life back into that person or be able to pray for somebody and give them the healing or pray for somebody for the needs which they have it it's it's not about the person it's about the God in you if we can get it away from us and begin to realize no this is God this is the god that's Eternal this is the god that created the universe this is the god who walked this we look in the life of Jesus Christ this is the same God that dwelt in him dwells in you the same God who was in The Prophet dwells in you there's no difference that was merely the body that God wanted to use at that period of time but now what isn't God is taken the prophet home what is he wanting to do now he's in our body yes he's in you he dwells in you there's no difference here you have to release the god that is in you you have to all of a sudden yield to the spirit of God as he guides and as he directs your life because you run run across situations all of a God needs you there's nobody else around God needs you so just open up and follow the leadership of God in your life God is no respector of persons that's right it says in Isaiah Whom Shall he teach knowledge and to whom shall he make to understand Doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people to whom he said this is the rest which you may cause the weary to rest and this is refreshing but they would not hear it's talking here what we talk what we talk about the baptism of the Holy Spirit when all of a sudden I mean we speak in tongues you know I mean used to some stud some don't um but that that's basically what this is referring to but this is the rest it's no longer should be a struggle that's right if we can rest in God and God leading then there's no struggle then there's no fight then there then there's no there's no problem if if you've been taken if you've been taken and been trained in a certain way then not then you know Ty people they're mechanics I mean if you've done it enough all of a sudden somebody brings a car in and has this problem and this oh yeah I've seen that a hundred times yeah okay bring it over here we'll take care of it there's rest you're not struggling wonder what it is wonder what the problem is no no you know because by your te by your training and by your teaching and by the knowledge that you have you know how to fix this problem because you've seen it before well Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he already knows the problem he already has the answer so if you can re rest in him and let him do the work through you then it's no longer you trying it's no longer you struggling Lord what am I supposed to do what am I supposed to do how should I do this what should I no no just rest in him and then all of a sudden he will give you the inspiration he will give you the words to say because it's no longer about you then it becomes about him and God wants to take care of the need before and all of a sudden it becomes him operating and working through you right we talked about in in I guess earlier this morning faith is unconscious we all have faith we just don't realize it we don't exercise it because if we would take Faith we would we begin to realize God is the one in control I mean I I mean I look at all of a sudden you know we were in India and we came back and we had plans to go someplace else and all of a sudden Co hit but that shut the world down there was no flights going anywhere okay well was this a surprise to God he knew about it he knew what our government would do he knew what the airlines would do he know that I couldn't get to India if I wanted to for the uh almost two years there was no way to get into India in fact one guy he lived in India and he happened to be in Africa doing something it took him almost a year to be able to get back home and then he finally got a flight and it just got into Bombay and then but there was no other flights within the country so then he had to rent a car and he had to drive all the way from the from the west coast to the east coast and and and he had to get some other people to help Supply the money for the gas and stuff but he was almost a year before he got home because there was no way to get home the people in India all of a sudden they found themselves if you were in a work crew and somebody had hired and he normally he goes into a village and hires all the able-bodied men and he would take them hundreds of miles away all of a sudden there was no Transportation they had to walk a 100 miles or better just to get home but God knows this it wasn't a surprise to him because what's he doing he's taking the whole world and he's changing the whole economy of the world what so the all the economies have to fall the our economy in America has to fall because this will bring in the this it has to fall so that Jesus Christ can come and set up his kingdom for the Millennium so that's why everything is the way that it is that's why our economy is going to where it's going God has a plan God has a purpose but if we know that it's God then why do we worry because we rest in him he promised to supply our needs he promised to take care of us he promised to heal us he promised to see to it I think what uh David he said I've never seen the the children of God begging bread well okay so I'm I that's what I expect Lord if all of a sudden there's nothing all of a sudden okay I don't know how you supply it but you said you would so now we just wait for it to come there um there's a book I read the Reese how the intercessor this was written during the second World War and the guy had an orphanage and and this is one part thing in the thing um all of a a sudden he had a bunch of kids to feed and there was no food and God spoke to him he says well if you had the food what Would You Do Well we'd thank him for it well so they started praying and thanking God and there was nothing on the table well there we thank you for the food you suppli us we thank you for the blessing that you you know and and uh soon as he said amen there was a knock at the door there was a bread truck that broke down just in front of the orphanage and he had no way have to deliver the bread so all of the bread got to the orphanage God already knew but he was trying the man he says where's your faith where's your faith another one that God had told him he says I want you to go to a certain certain city the guy says I don't have any money for the pl for the for the for the for the train fair and God says well if you had it what would you do well I'd get in line well okay he gets in line all of a sudden it's he was the next one to step up to the window and somebody says here somebody told me God told me to give you this God is never late but he's always very seldom early because he wants do you trust me have you reached the place in your relationship with me that you trust me because this is where it's going to come down to us in our lives do we trust God do we actually acknowledge Him has it come to the place in our relationship with God regardless of what happens are you do we believe that God's going to supply do we believe that God will take care of us do we believe that God will do this but we have to come down to the place where we actually believe this like like I think I might have read this this morning he said that the disciples had the word because Jesus Christ was there and Jesus Christ says I'm giving you the authority to go and to heal the sick and raise the dead go around to the village and send them out two by two and so they would go out and and and I I kept wondering you know if they when they came to a village and they saw at sitting at the gate um what what would what was their reaction they had seen Jesus do all the Miracles they knew he could but them to do it but then they went in head and they prayed for the man at the gate the man may maybe he was a and all of a sudden God healed them and that would have given them faith and then they would have gone on further and they would go into the villages and then afterward they got together and all had a they begin to give testimony service of what God had done for them as they' walked into the different Villages and seen all these things and and my in my mind's thinking Jesus Christ would have sat back and he would have rejoiced finally you understand finally you understand and then and finally he said he says don't don't don't don't don't get about the Miracles and stuff he says he says that should be normal to you because of who you are you're sons of God this is your rightful position this is what you should be doing he said be Rejoice because your name's written in heaven Rejoice because you are a part of God Rejoice because you are part of God from the beginning this is who you are this is what you should be doing this is and and so all of a sudden because of that then then then they could go and they could begin to do the different thing yes but then this one man brought a to one of the his kids to the the disciples after a while and and and the disciples didn't they they couldn't cast The Demon out of the man out of the Sun and Jesus says you know bring him to me and Jesus began to pray of me and the disciples asked well why couldn't we do this he says because you didn't have the faith right oh ye of little faith if you had the faith to believe it this would have been taken care of why do I have to do this God should have been able to do it through you but you have to have the faith you have to understand who you are they have to begin to realize that we are they were Sons and Daughters of God they had to realize that God now dwelt in them that Jesus Christ had given them the authority to do and to take care of of the situations which which fell before them and God has that Authority has never been removed that's right that's right the authority that Jesus Christ gave to the disciples that Authority is still still available to all of us but you have to believe it like did they talk we were reading there in in in the scripture he says he says God had taken it through Moses he performed all these Miracles and all these wonderful things like that God was trying to demonstrate to them this is who I am right amen I control the weather I contr control I can I can create I can destroy I can do all these these things but you have to have faith in me you have to believe that I am God you have to believe that I can do all things that I am all I I am all Supreme am all powerful you have to believe this he God was that was was God was trying to demonstrate but it goes on to them for for the um for the For unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with the in faith that it hurt it and when you go into one of the Psalms the way that the psalmist puts it he says oh yeah God provided this let's see if he can do this now God provided us here quite maybe he can supply us beef God did this and let's see if he can do that but they were always challenging God it wasn't that they had faith in that God they were just trying of putting out to God well let's see if you can do this this is what we want now let's see if you can do this and that wasn't how God operated but it comes down we we've we've seen through the prophet's Ministry we have seen God perform there is no questions in our mind that's why people always wanted to go see the prophet oh if the prophet prays for me I know I can be healed what about your what about your your pastor what about the one sitting next to you you don't believe in their prayers I know when we were in India that there was a sister that came up I was praying for one person and the guy I was with he was praying for this other sister and uh so then when I was praying for her left and so this lady came over to me I looked at her and I says do you believe his prayer and she just stared at me I said if you didn't believe his prayer you won't believe in mine so just go I mean brother bradam says if you prayed for something he says don't go back the second time because it showed you didn't have faith the first time and the more that you go up for the same thing he says all of a sudden your faith becomes less and less and less no you have to take God at his word you have to believe he prayed for me and God they laid hands on me if they laid hands on me I am healed because God said I'm Healed and you just accept it and you begin to thank him for it I I know there was a time during the co Shirley was was real sick and I had prayed for her and stuff but I I I wanted something a little more I guess you'd call it during Co we were only allowed 10 people in church I found out there was only seven so we could go um and I went to the pastor and I say surely sick Bible says call for the Elders of the church let them lay hands on them let them anoint with oil prayer faith shall save the sick I says I want that for my wife okay they they anoint her with oil they prayed for her yeah it was done deal I did what the scriptures had taught I needed that extra little thing that I could relate back to the scriptures with so I could challenge Satan know we we follow what God Said in his word and because we follow what God Said in his word now God is obligated to fulfill his word in her life and from that point on we began to thank him thank thank you Lord for this and thank you Lord for doing this and the other when when I was in uh we in in Youth Camp we we we've helped out there for a number of years and it was interesting we were there and uh we had one service and you know at the end of the service you the Evangelist of the minister he gives an altar call and all these people come running forward and so we as the ministers we went ahead and laid hands on the different ones and tried to figure out their needs and pray for them according ly the next night all another Minister he gave an altar call and I noticed the same amount of people came forward okay so we went and prayed and prayed and prayed third night was the same and I says Lord I don't understand this why can't they accept what we have already prayed for them for and some thoughts came in my mind for the lack of better way of expressing it where all of a sudden it's kind of like a story it says there was this there was this girl and she was out in the streets begging I mean her her clothes was filthy her hair was a mess and just and she was begging just give me a little piece of bread just just a little morsel of bread I'm so hungry just share with me just a little bit of something and finally I mean she did this for a while and finally she says you know there there's a guy in the Mansion on the hilltop and uh maybe he'll be nice maybe he will give me something and so she goes up in the door and she knocks in the door and the good man of the house opens it up and she was begging please give me just a little piece of bread just just a little MC of bread I'm so hungry I haven't eaten for days just a little something and all of a sudden the man looks at down and says sweetheart what are you doing out here begging you're you're my wife this is this is your house oh honey look at your clothes they're so filthy go in and take a bath you know washing of the Water by the word oh and you're dress we there's plenty hanging in there just just clothe yourself in the garments of righteousness and there we have tables spread we've been waiting for you to come back and everything that you want to eat is always been there it's all been waiting for you to come you don't have to beg this is yours this is your house this is where you liveen we don't have to beg right I don't go to God as a beggar I go to him as his wife cuz I'm his bride right I go to him as his bride washing of the Water by the word I'm clothed in his righteousness every time I read the word it's just cleansing me and cleansing me it keeping me pure and what do I do I sit down at his table it's always spread out before me and I just Feast upon the word I Feast upon I listen to the message I listen to it I read it I study it and I go through the Bible and I read it and I study it it just constantly taking the word into my life into my until literally I and the word hopefully eventually will just become one but I don't have to beg right and that's what these kids were doing they're always begging for a morsel of bread when it was rightfully theirs by who they were there's one Minister he there one sister was there and I mean there were men too okay I'm not picking on the sisters but this this was the example and and this girl was crying out and crying out and crying out and finally the ministers went over over there it says why don't you start thanking him don't beg why don't you start thanking him for what you're wanting and so she changed her tune she began to praise God and thank him for whatever it was she had need of and a few minutes later all of a sudden she was running the aisles she was standing rejoicing because she was no longer begging she had accepted now what God has rightfully given her by virtue of who she is amen you don't have to beg God he wants he actually wants to give it to you he wants to give you a bountifully pressed down overflowing or something he he wants to give it to you because of who you are you are his child you are his wife so why beg am I mean my my wife and I yeah we you know she has the credit card she knows what the bank balance is you know I says you know just don't overdraw you're fine but I mean it it it it's if we have it why not okay why should I deny her what she has need of when I have the means to provide for that well God is no different he is he is our husband he and and and there's no limits to him you have need of healing he's already healed you it's already paid for why not just accept it why not just praise him for it healing is a process it's not a miracle healing is a process so sometimes we get sick so yeah I mean I I I get sick so my body tells me lay down drink fluids go to bed get some rest okay so I obey what my body is dictating to me I lay down I eat drink plenty of fluids get lots of rest and all of a sudden my body has the ability to heal itself from within that's how God created us if I don't listen to what it says I pay for it the next day but here again God has already created God has already made it Satan has put the sickness on fine but God is already my healer so I thank him for my healing but I also have to sometimes I have to give my body the rest I have have to allow it to to to heal itself in the revelation of Jesus Christ brother Brown says it talks about Christ in Christ in the true church he says Satan cannot stand it he knows that the people get a true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for she can she can do the Greater Works and she will become an invincible Army Invincible means defeatable amen so why are we defeated because we're not willing to accept who we are what is it that dwells inside of us God he's not some little wimp he's not some little nothing that has it's afraid of oh no Satan's here again oh no I better behave oh no I better back up and let oh hogw no we have control over him we have the ability to fight him Jesus could call 10,000 angels well we have access to everything that's Heaven brother Bram says God brother Bram says that God will bankrupt Heaven before he'll let any of his promises fall so why don't we access it I mean why don't we claim who we are why don't why don't we exercise The Authority that has been given to us be by virtue of who we are we are his sons and we are his daughter and even more than that we are his wife I know somebody attacks my wife they have to go through me I will defend her well what do you think God will do Satan's attacking um he better not attack his wife he's got God on his hands but we have to believe this it doesn't do any good to recite it it has to be a reality to us to us we actually have to have the faith to believe that the god that is in US is has the ability and and is willing to go and to fight for us to protect us and and to guard and to provide for us we have to actually believe this and once you begin to believe this once you begin to accept it then the party is over then all of a sudden Satan comes puts his ugly head up and you just come on come on boy I want to give you a good one this time I mean but this is our rights right I mean I make it in a humorous thing but you you get the point why let him defeat us we have the authority he's given us that Authority amen he said that he said according to the message of full maturity the word has been restored to to us in his full power right that means everything that God is amen has been restored to us right God is not defeatable he created everything everything is subject to him well if that's the case then all of that power has been given unto us then why don't we use it why don't we exercise it the the only balance thing is to that Paul was in one place and and there was this lady falling around and and and was prophesying you know these guys have come to do this and this and this and and and but Paul had to wait until he had the word from God it says now you cast it out he couldn't do it right at the beginning he had to wait until God gave him the command to go ahead and and to cast that demon out because it wouldn't have happened before then brother bradam what you you look into the things that he said when he has a vision all of a sudden no everything has to be in place right no this lady has to come in she has to be dressed in certain things she has to take this hat and move it from here over to here and she has to take this and push this over here and all of a sudden when all of the things were all said in placees ah now is the time and so then then all said then he spoke the word but it all had to come in the Todd's timing it all had to be the way that God had that God had had showed the prophet amen I mean I think it l thinking of David David was fighting the Philistines he went out and fought them one day and and then the the the Philistines gathered together again and David says should we go out and fight him he says no not not a direct us all he says go around behind them when you see the the wind and the mberry trees he says then you attack because God had planned God knew what he was doing but we have to listen to him we have to follow his unction we have to follow his leadership he say what was Jesus manifested for to show God he was God he had to be no man could die a prophet no Prophet could i h he was God he was the god of the prophets he was the prophets he was the he was the Kings he was the history he he was all of that and throughout that purpose he achieved a church that he the fullness of God might bring to pass every promised word of God in these last days when he gets the preeminence that means he has to be the leader he has to be the one guiding he has to be the one that inspires you to be able to say the things that he once said if you just say it because you want to say it I mean I could say oh let there be snow tomorrow let there be snow tomorrow if that isn't the will of God it won't snow I don't expect snow tomorrow okay but but would you see what I'm trying to say right but if all of a sudden God anoints me and all of a sudden I call for snow yeah get out your shovels but I mean but you have to understand it's it has to be God directed brother Bram just couldn't speak the squirrels into existence all of a sudden God had to lead him he couldn't give that fish the life until God had spoke to them he said give that fish back its life and all of a sudden the fish you came back to life again go God had to wait for God to lead him and for God to give him the words to say and once that once God had directed him then it was God it wasn't brother R I'm speaking well it has to come now in our lives where it's the same thing where it's no longer us doing but it's God now doing it through US brother Bram and the anointing on of the end time he goes on and he goes into great length he says I have no he says I have no more to do it within nothing no no more I'm no more than just a voice I wasn't the one that appeared down the river I was only standing there when he appeared I'm not the one that on the platform these things and foretells these things that happens are as perfect as they are I'm only the one that's near when he does it I was only a voice that he ra that he used to say it it wasn't what I knew it's what it's what I just surrendered myself to that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the Son of God it was the it wasn't the angel his messenger it was it was the mystery that God unfolded it's not a man that's God the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he is the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a on on a man uh a man with his words his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man amen that's the message that's it it's not just a man speaking it's not just a Kentucky hillbilly he yielded himself to God and so God could take and speak through him and what was he trying to do to the bride he was trying to encourage the bride accept what you are begin to understand this is the mag this is the beauty of of the god this is the beauty of the message this is the beauty of Salvation God is trying to raise us up out of Lady oia and and to get us into into in Revelations 4:1 come up higher I got some things I want to show you and then and then with that the word has been opened up unto us and every time you begin to read the word all of a sudden oh that's what I am oh that's how God does this and we begin to relate that to us and our lives and the things which we are doing and we begin to realize it's not about us it's about God and God is wanting vessels that he can work through and the SM and church as he says these elect were were these elect were not only the Eternal thoughts of God which were to be expressed in flesh in their due season but these elect are called by another name now to Abraham and a seed were the promises made and he sayith not to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ and if ye be Christ then are you Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise so we have to be in Christ in order to be Abraham's seed and all the promises being able to relate to us how do you get into Christ by one Spirit we all baptized into the body and into his body without the baptism of the the Holy Spirit you're on the outside you are not reborn until you receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit but once you've received the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's when God himself comes and dwells in you and that is the Seal of your salvation because once you are sealed into salvation he says that's it that there there's no questions any anymore things might happen in your life but he says once God has come into you and sealed You by their baptism of the Holy Spirit from that point on your salvation is secure he said then he goes on not only to narrow it down by defition but rather to finalize it for in Galatians 3 he identifies the seed singular with Jesus encounter the seed the children the sea the seed children as children of Promise the promise as having to do with election or the choosing of God and that is exactly what we have been saying these who are the Royal seed are the elect of God they are the predestinated for known of God and were in the mind of God and in his thoughts that's who you are you were forn of God because you were the seed of God because you were the seed of God God knew who you were and God were looking for you God was always looking for himself only only the elect of God can be redeemed and you're redeemed what does redeem mean being brought back being brought back into your rightful position with God in very plain language the true bright of CH then in very plain language a bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in their designated decreed season as each member not as each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body thus the bride is the literal spoken word seed bride is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same Source was eternal with him and is now manifesting God in a many membered body whereas one once God was manifested in one member Even in our Lord Jesus Christ so we have to begin to understand where do we come from what were we always a part of you always were a part of God Amen that is hard to comprehend but it isn't me that I mean this is what the word says this is what brother BR God is through the prophet is trying to tell us I am a seed of God I always was a seed of God I always was a child of God but now I have to step into the position of being of being that son and when I step into the position of being son then all the rights and privileges of being a son all of a sudden it it it it comes with it but then I have to be trained I have to be trained how do I use the power how do I use the authority I cannot use it whe I don't if I don't have the character so God has to develop in me the character of Jesus Christ and the more of the character of Jesus Christ all of a sudden becomes my character then all of a sudden more and more he can take and he can take the power that is rightfully Mind by virt of who I am and he can take that power and he can let me exercise it this is what he had to do in brother bram's life this is what he had to do in brother bram's life in Ministry he had God had to train him God had to teach him in fact there was one incident where he was sitting there before he had the the spoken word all of a sudden a couple of kids came in and they were sitting on the front row and they started making love in front of everybody and brother Ram says don't do that he cautioned him two or three times and all of a sudden God spoke to him and said whatever you say that's what's going to happen and there's a pause brother Brown says I forgive you for that because he could have smitten them blind he could have smitten him dead in fact brother God had the angel had told him a previously he he said there's a trap that Satan has laid out for you but wouldn't tell him what it was well that was the Trap and God was trying to God God knew how brother Brandon was going to act okay but he had to prove to brother bradam that you have the character of Jesus Christ in you and therefore you will not act ACC act in ways which are not according to God's purpose and will that's right amen so God has to develop in us the character he cannot trust us with a he cannot trust us with the power until all of you know until we have the character you don't take a three-year-old and give them your 44 magnum and said they're here son go have some fun I mean you know no you have to train them okay well God can't do can't can't give us the all the power that's rightfully ours until we have been adequately trained until we actually know how to know what to do with the power that is rightfully ours he said he said now then we're coming to a conclusion as the Eternal logos God was manifested in the Sun and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that Eternal one was the father manifested in flesh and thereby gained the title of son so he's talking about Jesus Christ he was he he was a part of God he was the fullness of the God all that stuff then he goes on even so we so he's taking what Jesus Christ was and now he's relating that to us even so we Eternal in his thoughts just as Christ was in our turn became the many membered spoken word seed manifested in flesh and those Eternal thoughts now manifest In the Flesh are the sons of God even as we are so called we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in nonseed there's nothing to Quicken why do you believe the message because God's seed was there amen God took that seed and he quickened it he brought it to life and over the over the course of your life he's been taking you and molding you and making you but he's bringing us to this a time now when the seed that was put in us has to come to full manifestation has to come to full maturity this is the bride age this is where Jesus Christ is going to come and so live in the bride until we literally will become the manifestation of God himself and we think well how will I act well look look at the prophet how did he act he was still brother brandom he still liked to hunt he still liked to fish he still like to joke he still likeed to have fun he still likeed to do okay but then when God needed him he was there well we are we are what we are I mean my personality enters into everything I preach okay I can't help it that's just who I am okay but I have a some at least in India they I have a way of making something so simple they can everybody can understand it well I hope that's true but but we have to come down to the place we are still us amen but when God wants to use us if we can yield ourselves to him in spite of our Humanity then God can begin to work through us and God can can begin to manifest himself to us why would I speak that to that girl I says don't look at the stupidity act but look at her look at her give her her life back that was God speaking through me to her God gave her her life because I was the spoken word to her and I was in a miserable myth I mean my mental everything no I was not the one you wanted to have pray for me at that time I mean I was mad I was upset I was frustrated okay all of My Flesh was there but God looked past all of that he managed in spite of all of that he managed to go ahead and and and and and take me and and actually even in that state he I he was able actually to speak through me and give life to that child so it doesn't matter your mental state you don't have to be super spiritual you don't have to be living with the angels and flying around in heaven no you you just you but if you can take you and give it to God and let God use you he will do things through you that you could not even begin to imagin he said now then we're coming to a conclusion as the Eternal logos God was manifest in the Sun and and and and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that Eternal one was the father manifested in flesh and thereby G I guess I read that yeah so hold this carefully in mind he says now take the next step redeem means to buy back it restores to the original owner God by his death he the shed blood he brought back his own he brought back the spoken word seed bride my sheep hear my voice and they follow me you always were sheep you never were a p or a dog turned into a sheep that's impossible for every kind of Life produces the same kind and there's no change in species as we were in the thoughts of God and then ex and then expressed in flesh there had to come a time a day when we would hear his voice the word and hearing that voice become aware of our father calling us and recognize that we are sons of God but we've heard it through the prophet right but now it has to become a reality amen and that's where the that's that's where the problem comes I'm told that when you take when you take an engineer and he goes to a to a new to a a new business sometimes they will give them a project which um nobody else has been able to solve because they weren't told it can't be solved so they'll work on it and they'll work on it and they'll come up with an answer and all the other people couldn't why because you were you you weren't told that it can't be be solved you weren't told that it was impossible well God will take us and need we might think well this is impossible well when you're relying upon yourself yeah it is but if you look to God and begin to realize you have the answer and then God directs I know this one brother he works in he does metal fabricating and all of a sudden there was a problem came in they guy wanted something fabricated and he thought and he thought and he thought and finally he just kind of gave up and went to you know went home went to bed and then at night all of a sudden we wakes up in the morning that's how how to do it then he goes back to the shop and all of a sudden they they tell him yeah why didn't we think of that that's so simple but here again he had to get away from himself and he had to simmer himself down so God could speak and often that's the way it is in our lives we have to let God in we have to let his thoughts become our thought we have we have to let him guide and direct and so that we can do the things that that he wants done and the God who is rich in Mercy says only saying this not to mix up Doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and this scare you don't know who you are you are not going to be but now you are the sons of God so you always were sons of God when God had you in his thinking at the beginning you have to be some part of you your life that's in you now had to be with God in the beginning in one place we we we we talk about faith and brother Bram uses his example and I used it a few times overseas brother Bram talks about we have to re come up to S having Supreme faith and we talk about faith as one thing Supreme oh my how are we going to have Supreme faith and brother Brown says uh well I'll paraphrase he says you have a car you go out take the key stick it in the ignition turn it you expect it to start because it always starts right there's no question well it's going to start because it always starts you walk into a room and it's dark you feel around flip on the light switch you expect light amen it always comes there's no question there's no frustrating you know call up your pastor I'm going to turn on my lights I'm going to turn on my lights pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray no you just go and flip the light switch and then you go on with your business right amen now that's the way it has to be with us and God where there's no question well God your word said so so it has to be yes amen okay we accept it we prayed we accept it okay God now it's your you you are obligated to your word brother Brown says that you're not obligated to me you're obligated to your word so if I take your word and I and I and and I sit there and I remind you of your word and I claim that promise that you've given in your word then now you're under under obligation to fulfill your word in my life amen and then we place it on him amen right sure he can do whatever he wants he may not do it the right then but he will because he said he would I mean there's no question here but see this is where we have this is where brother bradam red in his life he had a vision that was the end of the argument he knew it's going to happen because God gave him the vision and he always knew the Visions never failed then when he got to the place where of discernment he could look in the pth in their life he could look in the God would show them the future he could see them doing the things that they normally would do as a child or whatever the situation and he knew God had healed him and others he says now according to your faith and you know it's it's interesting with with healing some people had followed had followed Jesus Christ to where he was staying I think they were lepers who could have been blind I forget which one it was and finally brother or Jesus Christ j me says do you believe I can do this well yeah we believe you can do that he said then according to your faith that's what you can receive and they went they went away and all of a sudden according to their faith they were healed and you know that is the only stipulation there's no other stipulation it isn't how often you go to church you pay pay your tithes you do this and this and this and this this this this no do you believe it if you can believe it I will do it it's that simple we make it difficult we make it complicated it's not it's the Simplicity of the Gospel it's the Simplicity of taking God at his word and believing whatever God has said that is what God will do because he's God he cannot lie that's one thing he cannot do he cannot lie and once he's once he's made a promise then he's obligated to that promise he's obligated to do what his word says he would do and that's where we have to come in our relationship yes amen I I personally I know that I'm a Son of God God's revealed that to me amen I don't doubt that I don't question that because God revealed that to me amen I know I am the righteousness of God himself because the word says I am okay do I have faults and failures you bet you but am I the righteousness of God I sure am in the eyes of God that's how I stand there's no question on that because that's what the word declares that I am I know that I am a sinless before God why because I am in Christ Christ doesn't God doesn't see me he sees the sacrifice because he looks at the sacrifice he has to declare me righteous he has to declare me sinless because the sacrifice with a propitiation for my sins and therefore I before God I am sinless before God I am righteous because he says that that I am and it's merely taking him at his word and and and believing it now if you believe that you will live like it okay you can't say you know I'm the righteousness of God and you go out there the beer joints and all the other kind of stuff and sin and live in no no no no if there's no conversion if there's no change in life there is no conversion but once you've accepted Jesus Christ as your savior and once you realize the magnitude of the love that he expressed to you at Calvary then you will respond in love amen you know it's interesting somebody asked asked um they ask Jesus Christ what is the greatest of all the Commandments Jesus says well that's simple you love God with your whole heart soul mind body and spirit and the same is like unto the same you'll love your neighbor as yourself and these two Commandments rest all the laws and the prophets in this message what is the message love God with everything that's within you fall in love so in love with him and and him until you're willing to do everything that he says and everything he guides and everything directs because if you love him and you love your neighbor as yourself he says you've already fulfilled all the laws and the Commandments and from that point on then God can begin to lead you and he can begin to guide you and he can begin to to to to to to to uh direct direct your lives amen the people the people that were that came out of Egypt God performed Miracles God showed his mighty hand he brought plagues upon Egypt so that they could see this is who I am I am God and there's nothing can stand before me he went they came into Mount Si Mighty manifestation of God Thunders and Lightnings and earthquakes and voice of God sounded like a trumpet and everybody ran because they were scared and God why did God do that God did that so that they would fear Him and out of fear they would they would they would keep his law fear is a very poor motivator why don't we go 80 miles an arrow down the freeway because these guys with blue lights and they don't like you going 80 miles an hour down the freeway so they will stop you and they will give you a little citation and it'll cost you a few things okay but if if if if when God shows his love to you and then God himself comes and lives inside of you he changes your nature we are not under law we are under Grace Grace does not give us a license to sin Grace gives us the freedom to worship because under grace we can open up our hearts to God we can sit there and enter into his presence because we know that we are the very righteousness of God himself because we are in Jesus Christ and because we love him we automatically will do the things that he's wanting for us to do and he under the New Covenant he say I'm going to take my law and put it in their hearts and in their minds basically we will take on the very nature of God himself We Will We Will obey it because it's our nature to do so we will be we will obey God because of the love that we have for him and so love is a is a greater motivator than anything else we could have why why does the husband love their wives why are they say truthful to their to their wives and vice versa
