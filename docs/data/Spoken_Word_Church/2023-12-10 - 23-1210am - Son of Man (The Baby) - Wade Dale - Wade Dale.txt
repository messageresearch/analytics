somewhere beyond the believe not here brother George it's okay to have gifts and and get togethers and all that but boy there's going to be one where we're never going to part never will we have to leave we'll all be there together for an eternity and that's what we're that's what we're pressing toward uh good to have brother um Garland and sister Garland with us good to have them with us today it's always a pleasure to see them he'll be he'll be 86 young tomorrow so doing pretty well for a young fell heading toward 90 not too bad he's he's he's outlived his 72 brother John so he's on somebody else's time now so I think he's on God's time he's been a minister for years and years and years and now he's kind of settled down and retired a little bit so he can sit back and relax and enjoy uh his family and all but good to have them with us good to have all of you here good to have our World Travelers back with us sister Julie and brother Gary good to have them back with us and safe and sound amen amen good and good to have each and every one even now just remember we'll have one service tonight or today and then we're going to have a baptismal service afterwards sister denata is going to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus the pool's ready 100° so it's not going to be cold out there cuz we fired it up a couple of days ago thank God for electricity and heaters so cuz it was about 46° in that water yet two days ago when I plugged it up so we are going to have a baptismal service and then afterwards immediately we're going to Hidden Acres if you don't know where it's at if you're new here follow somebody or get directions it's really simple but if you're not from around here you say that because you're around from around here but if you're not from around here it's not too simple right but um but just get with somebody ride with somebody or or something like that so just remember that also remember uh brother Aaron will be back tomorrow uh brother Lise and I think Christian's leaving tomorrow too brother Luis will be back later on the week brother Bob will be speaking for us Wednesday night coming up December the 24th remember we'll have one service at 10:00 no Sunday school we'll just have one service on Christmas Eve also remember now we've we've changed things up just a tad uh December the 30th it still stays at 6:00 brother Eric guile from the Honduras will be with us but brother Luke Gibson had to cancel and I called a couple others and they said that it was too close to time and they already had something to do so we're just going to let brother Eric do the watch not service also he'll still be here so we'll just have it a weekend where um we're going to do a flyer up and we'll have some um bring some excuse me some Hispanic Brothers in we'll just have a Hispanic weekend be fine with me have brother Luis will be back so we'll have interpreters and and brother Eric speaks really good English so he doesn't need one but we're going to reach out to some of the Hispanic pastors and we'll just have a weekend of fellowship at 6:00 on Saturday brother Eric will be with us and then Sunday no service Sunday morning 8:00 that evening from 8: to midnight we will have a service take communion at midnight like we always have done for 50s something years and then we will have light snacks and drinks after each service so we'll get together on that a little bit later so God bless you we love you with a love of the Lord thank you all for coming thank you all for participating this year is almost over uh who would have thought 2024 was coming up but we're here and we're here because not because God's slack it's because we're slack all right so we need to we need to to jump on it and get her done this year coming up I think that we're all getting older and um more and more ailments are hitting us and and some of you that are sick uh natural families been sick um there for a couple of days so just pray for them but we are pressing the battle we are not going to stop we're going to keep fighting we're going to fight like brother Brown said till your teeth fall out and when your teeth fall out we'll gum him to death all right so uh I I don't like the devil no I don't like him at all um also before we um finish up brother Bob had mentioned about this brother Abraham and I I have tried for a year to get him here uh he is a prophet but I tell you how he works uh because he has a gift and what he does is he sits down with the pastors and he'll discern what's going on in the church but he will not bring to the pull pit and see that's wisdom that's not that's not wisdom to come up here and start bashing people and you know and it's all been 100% true so I don't think he's a false prophet but he is considered a prophet in Africa and over here also but I have tried for a year and he's just so full to um and don't nobody get nervous that's all right but he discerns what goes on in the church and he'll tell the pastor and the pastor will work on it through through through the wisdom of the pastor he can he can you know he can massage it in the in the congregation and brother Chad Lamb and different ones that's had him have told us that was how he worked and that's the that's the way it should work so we do believe in prophets I pray that I was in there with when brother Bob was speaking I said Lord s send one in America send one here we can use here even in this local assembly because we need all five-fold ministry right to keep the church clean ain't that what it's supposed to do to keep Church clean all right so let's don't get nervous kind like that marriage and divorce you start talking about prophets and marriage and divorce and people start you're shutting but we do we're humans today we're going to still be on the son of man it's not going to be part 140 whatever it is but we're going to talk about the baby all right cuz there was a baby born we know he wasn't born December 25th we know he's born in April just all like all Lambs are born but we do uh you know the prophet of God um he had services around Christmas and he he preached on God's wrapped gift he preached on why it had to be Shepherds he preached on why little Bethlehem so I believe that he around the time of that year he entered into not the festivities like the world does but he did we've all got our minds on that so so let's speak on a little bit we talk about the son of man as the as the grown man but let's talk about the son of man the baby today maybe it'll help you because it helped me when I was talk uh when I was working on it to kind of weave this in so like I said Lord bless you we'll be finished in a little while we'll go to baptismal service everybody's invited there will be uh excuse me a full catered meal for everyone plenty of food for you to eat and then we'll have some uh some gifts for the officers and uh and and different ones and you'll all get one today after service don't rush out of here real quick cuz there's an envelope for every one of you that pays TI than go to church here okay so all right we've done that for a long time Brother D have been real gracious at Christmas also and uh we're going to continue that tradition Lord willing so let's bow our heads dear heavenly father Lord thank you for this day thank you for the opportunity to stand before the purchase of your blood Lord and we we know that around this time of the year some Lord that's lost loved ones we thinking back there how we've lost two or three in the congregation Lord I pray that you'd Comfort the families that you would touch each one father bless the Lord the ones that we do have that are still here that we can hug on them and love them and tell them we appreciate them Lord we thank you for dying on a cross for us Lord but also thank you for coming as a newborn baby and I pray that you'd help us today to speak Lord what you want us to say Lord you be the active participant in this service heal the sick bless the ones Lord to sin sick if it be anyone wants to be baptized again Lord just lay on their heart we'll do it and and be happy about it lord it's it's just something that that Thrills my heart to be able to to put somebody in a water and and let them come up in newness of life as the scripture says and walks with you father just bless each one now in Jesus name amen and we're going to use the same scripture because in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and for him right and there wasn't anything made without him that's right nothing all right but he had to become a baby all right he had to become a baby because he had to become one of us that's right and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory The Glory by God and Father full of grace and truth and brother colie your outfit looks good none of y'all say his outfit looks good none of y'all did I think it looks good all right y'all can sit down now talk about somebody's clothesall the older I get the less I less important it is right brother Kylie I just figure out if I can get here I'm good right brother Dy he say Amen so let's remember these things and and let's just talk a little bit I know it's hot in here the on but I don't know if the Air's on see if you can click it down to the air and U so let's look real quick here we are today and we're remember the son of man had to have a a beginning as we were talking about the other day the dispensations we know God is a dispensationalist and so was brother brandham and so are we we believe in dispensation how God takes one group of people sends somebody to that group of people does a specific work and then moves to the next dispensation as we see in the ch Church ages and as we see with these virtues add this and add that add this and add that all right everybody with me but now before that there was even a star or anything was this was this person and we explained it the other week with the with the jar and the water and there was this person there and he's the person of of God and Jehovah and logos and all those different words but Jesus Christ had not come in form yet to be our brother all right so we couldn't understand him as this God over here okay but now I can understand a God that can be birthed like you and I are birth without the sex part but we can be he can be birthed he can be birthed not in a beautiful hospital that's air conditioning and all the lights and they got all the music playing and no he was born in a in a in a stable in a barn uh stinky barn and and the swaddling clothes he was wrapped in they is the old uh cloth that goes around the ox neck so it probably was a little sweaty so but that was our God that he could do that but it was promised in Isaiah 7:14 say therefore the Lord himself have you give you a sign so he's going to give you a sign a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel all right now that interpreted is what God With Us CU we'll read in Matthew 1:8 now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise now here we see the birth of something coming and a name given everybody with me all right be with me for a minute here you you got you got Jehovah you got Rose of Sharon lily of the valley bright and Morning Star and you've got um employee you've got person you've got a grandpa you've got right but there's a name to that now when you bring to that name as we were talking about a few weeks ago the true name of of God is Jesus Christ amen cuz God's not a name Jehovah's not a name he had to have a name cuz you know what you got a name you have a name that you're specified that is you and that's your name and as as brother Joe said we're predestinated to come to this point right here and God knows what name and whatever name if we get another name over there guess what it won't be secret so secret nobody will know you listen when we get over to the other side we'll know each other and won't have to go I remember you no you'll know their name amen but your name today is specified with how you are and your character so this guy named Jesus Christ had a character all right everybody with me now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when his mother Mary was a spouse to Joseph before they came together in other words before they became husband and wife as far as consummation she was found with child now look of what of the Holy Ghost now what wait what what whoa whoa whoa that's the dispensation over here in the Old Testament he was above the people not in the people he was above the people all right so now God's going to change that dispensation dispensation instead of being God above us he's going to be God with us so he's going to what he's going to he's going to imorph himself into a the spirit of God called the Holy Ghost and he's going to create listen the Holy Ghost was the creator all right everybody with me and they knew in the in the New Testament just a to save time so it won't be so long they knew in the old in the New Testament you're the Creator something inside of you created all things good to have Benjamin with us today did you fly in no he did oh you didn't fly yourself though not yet nope you didn't fly he's working on his pilot license so we're waiting she was found with child of the Holy Ghost so the Holy Ghost was God in what in a form that we can understand that the Holy Ghost is going to overshadow this virgin and create as he created before cuz remember we've been talking about the beginning of the creation of God and we're going to read that in just a minute because this is where the creation of God began Amen in the womb of a woman all right not by sex but by Spoken Word the Holy Ghost overshadowed Mary didn't give her the Holy Ghost come on somebody she had to go to the upper room to get it everybody with me that didn't didn't give her the Holy Ghost but there was an act that happened in eternity right amen there was an act that happened in eternity cuz God can't change his mind so he came down as the Holy Ghost and through a a messenger Gabriel said you're going to have a child by the Holy Ghost and she's going to she's like she's 16 or 17 years old and we know Joseph was a lot older and and I'm sure he scratched his head cuz he didn't know anybody that had been born that way before and and I I want y'all to spiritualize this a little bit in your life cuz this is how you receive the Holy Ghost listen God can overshadow you that's an anointing but that Holy Ghost has to go inside you yes right that Holy Ghost had to create something and go inside of Mary literally in her womb and just plop it down right there and her body took over and what nourished it but by God what he said before he said every seed will bring forth of its kind so it's going to have to do it but he had to place it in there it wasn't placed in there by Joseph now remember Joseph and Mary had many many children afterwards James and different ones you you read that there was different ones that that were born but but Jesus was born different he was born he was had the Holy Ghost he didn't have to receive it on the River Jordan we'll talk about that in just a minute but in symbol he did listen you can't ask anything to God you can't add to the fullness of the godhead bodily he came here his spirit and his soul was almighty God are the Bible's wrong because right here it says his name Shall be Called Emmanuel which is God With Us not God coming to be with us in another person he came his own self in his own person but he came in a human flesh that was not perfect that was not Eternal cuz that's the same way with you right I'll read it here in just a minute where brother rown said God gives you when you're born a spirit and a soul only God can do that Satan can pervert what you got and he will do that that's what we call coming to the age of accountability we'll see that in just a minute but Jesus didn't have to come to the age of accountability but he did have to come to a place where we've been reading it for the past three weeks where he grew in Grace and knowledge that's right and being made perfect what this yes right he was subject to man he was subject to his Earthly mother and father when they caught him at 13 in the temple not caught him but found him in the temple doing what his father said he wasn't building cabinets he was preaching the word of God right but what you know he didn't you know what he didn't do I'll guarantee you that boy at 13 years old he didn't say well bless God I'm God and I don't have to do what y'all say no the Bible says after he made that statement that he was subject unto them amen right during that time even knowing he was God even knowing he was born different he was special he honored his father and mother that was on the earth and I put in quotation marks because Mary wasn't his say mother as far as birth mother as far as sexual birth mother all right St by with me all right so she was found with a child of the Holy Ghost and Joseph her husband being just man not willing to make her a public example was minded to put away priv but while he thought on these things look behold an angel of the Lord appearing to him cuz listen if you Ponder something in your heart anybody anybody you Ponder something in your heart and you're serious about it and you're serious about the situation and you're serious about what's going on and you're a Christian God's going to send you somebody he may not send you Gabriel he may send you by black luiso A Roberts he may send those guys by as an angel or a messenger to say hey Joseph it's okay buddy it's all right God's got this in control that's what we got to do we got to we got to let you know Joseph didn't say well I got to figure this thing out no he didn't figure it out he just did what the guy said th son of David fear not to take unto thee marry thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost all right and I am sure now I want to ask you a question where did that word Holy Ghost develop from cuz if if it was all in the Old Testament that was never mentioned it was always Jehovah God it was always Jehovah Jehovah now we see this new word come into this part of the Old Testament that he says you this guy's going to be uh born by the Holy Ghost well that's a revelation to Joseph and Joseph says hey this must be something new I know it's God I know I'm reading Isaiah 7 I read Isaiah 9 I'm reading all these different ones is this it and I'm sure the Angels go yeah this is it right you do what I tell you to do come on somebody you do what I tell you to do be sincere about it Joseph was sincere cuz he had a problem amen he had a wife that was pregnant and he had nothing to do with it so he was going to put her away and let her you know hide her somewhere used to a long time ago that's the same way um many many years ago if a girl got pregnant she disappeared for a while what she went somewhere to some aunt's house or uncle's house and right because it was a shameful thing now you just bringing anywhere you want to and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus now here is Joseph got a name to call him now right for he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord by the prophet saying Behold a virgin shall conceive which is Isaiah we just read and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is God With Us yeah not part God all of God the fullness of the godhead body that's what we've been talking about the Statue of perfect man The Headstone listen as a baby sure he developed as a human being but he was almighty God he didn't have to become God if he become God I need to find the other guy that was born virgin come on I need to find him cuz he's the one that saved me not the other one Luke 1:30 says the angel said her fear not Mary for thou H has found favor with God how many of you today would like to have an angel come and say fear not you found favor with god well if you'll listen on Wednesday and Sunday and and press play every once in a while God's telling you I found favor with you remember I told you if you're born again today God says I am pleased to dwell in you just like he did on the River Jordan and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus he shall shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest now remember there were many jesuses in that day that was a common name he wasn't the only Jesus has ever lived okay he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David but here is his here is what's attached to that child Mary knows he he's he's something special and as brother R say she had to wait at least a month to know she is pregnant everybody know your sisters know what I'm talking about and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end that's why we were talking about the other day the son of David there's his promise give him the Throne of his father David so he'll be on the throne now and forever through the Millennium and all the way through but he at at that time though now he picks up a bride which is us he come to get a bride he came as a baby to save the people sure but he came to get me you cuz you and I were inside that we were inside that child amen if not you're not part of God that's right so where because where' you come from your eternal life came from that guy now as a baby he couldn't die for you but he sure did have eternal life inside of him I'll promise you that if he didn't like I said we need to find that guy cuz he's the one that's going to save you not the one that born like me and you cuz we born dead right he was born to die you and I were born Dead come on somebody then Mary said unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the high shall overshadow thee in other words come upon you with an anointing but not just with an anointing we're going to drop something in a place right and everybody with me we're going to drop something in a place because listen in our natural birth there's something dropped in a place is everybody with me right in a natural birth but it's placed by a man and a woman together this is going to be placed by God which is the beginning of the creation God which is spoken word nothing no desire no sexual desire that's why Jesus didn't have a carnal mind you and I have a carnal mind cuz we know where we came from and our mama came from and our daddy came from and our sister came from and we all know that that's why that's why Paul said first thing he says we need to mind of Christ sir we need to take that carnal mind to get rid of it right listen you can't deny your first birth I'm looking at it but there's something in a second birth we'll talk about in just a minute that will take care of that first birth amen you believe that therefore that Holy thing which shall be born in thee shall be called The Son of God so that was what the Holy Ghost the Son of God in that dispensation he's coming to dwell inside but when you put that Son of God in human flesh he becomes what the son of man all right believe us thou this brother R said look we're not born into that into that by his righteous Holy Blood without sexual desire he died at Calvary given his blood that we could be free from sin brother you believe that if you don't you're lost that's all because it's in the blood we're saved by the blood of God now brother R later on he says you're not saved by the blood you're kept saved by the blood but we are that listen in that baby flowed no DNA from a man on Earth he was literally a Superman he came from another planet called eternity called Heaven all right why do you think all the world is trying to emulate all that Superman this man this guy this this guy's got some kind of superpower but they all have one flaw Kryptonite and all the other things you know we don't listen we got one that don't have it he's a mighty conqueror he conquered everything death hell and the grave took it all with him and gave it back to me and you we'll read that here in just a second so Jesus was the blood of his father which was holy unadulterated blood not by sexual desire but by Holy Ghost was he born conceived in the womb of Mary and was born I believe that with all my heart Revelations 3:14 we've been reading this because remember he's The Headstone but he had to become the Cornerstone he had to become a baby he had to he had to come like me and you so that we can understand him and understand his life and look at him and and see where where we miss it out right and to the angel of the Church of the loud of sins which is today these things sayith the amen the faithful and true witness we were talking about that word true the beginning of the creation of God that sounds kind of that sounds kind of Str strange how can God have a beginning well brother R said he had a beginning in the womb of a woman right that's the way he wanted to be in the first place Revelations chapter 4 Listen to What brother R said he says remember a couple of Sundays ago we got to it the big diamond cutting many different ways to reflect the fire and light from one that's the way Jesus Christ is the beginning of the creation of God Revelations 1 he means sorry he means Revelation 3:14 but Revelations 1 is that right then when was God created he's the beginning of the creation of God and God is eternal is that right but when God was created when a little baby that was conceived in the womb of a mother a virgin that's when he began and she began to develop these C within her to bring forth this little baby that was the beginning of God's creation for God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and became imman God will us the beginning of the creation of God then in him that great Jewel that comes from the dust cuz he was made of dust he eat food like I do he eat feed like food like you do which dust of the body he became calcium potach petroleum Cosmic light but in him dwelt Eternal Light there was no darkness in him at all you and I different story no wonder the wise men said guide us to thy Perfect Light they were just reflecting the light of one Perfect Light and there he was the perfect light of God beginning of the creation of God and his brother R says I didn't bring the quote for save for time he said and you're the continuation of that creation cuz you can't help it how you got here but you can help it how you leave here amen you can't help it how you got here but you sure can help how you leave here sir all right God perfecting his church 1954 then the next time God was manifested was in his son Christ Jesus and then he came through a virgin birth conceived by a Virgin overshadowed by the Holy Spirit God himself came down into a blood cell and wrapped the blood around him the blood cell The Germ of Life Of God himself wrapped this blood cell that brought forth the sun Christ Jesus I'm reading everybody still believe brother B was a prophet all those you that awake okay those of you sleep just say Amen when you get shook somebody shake you say Amen cuz I do believe brother Brown was a prophet he's our Prophet all right now what he did does by that look to make you perfect and bring you back into Fellowship he brings you through that blood cell into himself you get it through the blood cell of the Lord Jesus that inail the life of Jehovah there's your identification he was Jehovah the old test test Jesus of the new because he didn't pick up a different life when he come down here we're going to explain that here in just a few minutes all right cuz you and I did he didn't pick up a life he was life and we've come through the blood cell becomes a part of what that life so listen if any part of Jesus had a beginning except his body then we need to find somebody that didn't cuz we got to attach ourselves to that we got to attach oursel to something that's Eternal all right so deity itself whoo stop who no that's only God that maybe brother BR deity itself lays in a man that's received the Holy Spirit you are a son I'm a Brandon by birth and a part of Mr M brandom is in me and if you becoming s son and daughter of God part of deity lays in you praise the Lord give him a hand clap deity one God deity is one God yes right and the form of the Holy Ghost is inside of you but now listen when that comes into the form of you come on somebody you become the bride and that's his last and morphe here on Earth with the Gentiles is in a bride yes everybody with me all right 1961 do you ever noticed a little baby when it was born it little muscles twitching and jerking but when it comes to the earth now watch this it receives a spirit and then it becomes a living Soul now listen and as soon as that Soul goes back from that little body there's another one waiting for it all right hold on because first God makes the soul in spirit and it goes to the body all right so you get a soul and a spirit now listen you get a soul that's created by God perfect but not Eternal cuz God can't make anything imperfect everybody with me all right he's the only one can give life Satan cannot give life he can only pervert what God's already made all right because first God makes the Soul and Spirit it just goes to the bodies and when we leave here we only change Dwelling Places and go to another now we are we know in this church there's one thing for sure I don't have a theophany over there hanging up in a closet in heaven right I'm looking at it right now well wait a minute I'm looking at the Shell that is in cuz if there's another body over there brother BR didn't believe in transmigration of souls he didn't believe a a soul can move to another body come on somebody it's being built right here and when we leave here we only change Dwelling Places and go to another for this Earth Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting so that's our consolation comforter 1961 so it's just like a little baby when a little baby is conceived in the mother's womb it's just flesh and blood and jumping quivering but as soon as it's born you don't see it but there's a spirit and soul hanging near that mother to come into that baby just as soon as it's born so the holy ghost man Mary the Holy Ghost put a seed and a and a egg inside of Mary's womb and he just hung around for about nine months and went right back in but remember our spirit by nature is Fallen our soul is perfect but not Eternal you make your decision in your soul you don't make your decision in your spirit righten hello somebody Faith or doubt that's it you make your decision in your soul it emanates out into your spirit and then all your body does is does what the inside tells them to do listen there's nothing wrong with your flesh it's what's inside of it's wrong oh I sin in my flesh no you don't you s yeah you sin in your flesh with your flesh but not not motivated by your flesh your flesh has no mo ation except what's on the inside all right the spirit that's why all babies go to heaven now look I'm going show you right here mother it comes into that baby just soon as it's born so when a baby's born and thank God for a prophet that that if it uh many people are asking questions about abortions and different things well if you go by what brother Brown said unless that baby is born and starts breathing air it's not a soul he said it's wiggling muscles just like an animal right right yeah the only difference in Us in an animal brother George is God puts a soul in there for us to make a choice it's from God it's not nature we have a nature attached to that but he just when I I think many times you know we like to deer hunt and different things and and it's taking of a life but it's not taking of a of an eternal life for it's not taking of a life that has to be judged uh and God told us we can do it all right but I always wonder what happens you know when they close their eyes here they just go away cuz there's no place for them to go yeah God preserve them I believe and there'll be all kind of animals there that we won't have to kill but when you close your eyes when you pass away and you close your eyes you go to a place whether it be Heaven or Hell not the same I'm talking about the fifth and sixth Dimension you going to go somewhere and guess what's going to happen you come in right back here to make a choice the deer don't have to it don't have a soul it has a spirit though a nature about it so listen to this just as soon as that baby is born God has created look God has created a soul and created a spirit to be in that baby just soon as it's born in this world God sends an angel where it be whatever you want to say he sends a birth Angel down with a a little ball of light hey if brother round can tell story so can I how do you think it happens it just floats in like this and floats back out like this no I believe God listen there's death Angels there's cheram serams there's altar Angels there's all kind of angels God sends an angel down with this little ball of light and as soon as Donnie fall Bush was born 70 something years ago good grief at least I didn't say you he and he becomes a what a living soul but now look living but dead Jesus Christ was the same way the Holy Ghost overshadowed Mary put the product in and then when that baby was born by the power of God he entered that baby now listen he may have made your soul and your spirit but he didn't enter your soul or enter your spirit right he made one and gave it to you because that makes you an individual that makes you where you got to make a choice oh I always was eternal if you had eternal life you did but you w nothing but dead when you was born that's what I believe about Redemption it's not replacement it's bringing back that which fail what fell you fell in your soul just as soon as that baby is born God has created a soul and created a spirit to be in that baby just as soon as it's born born in the earth that little baby look becomes mature now watch that little baby becomes mature now what what we're talking about we're talking about the New Birth I'm going to talk about that in just a second ago that's what happens to me and you all right now listen he doesn't take your soul out and put his soul in at a new birth cuz that's the exchange no you are who you are God just burns out that old nature and puts himself inside of you all right praise the Lord I just believe that's the way it is I don't believe I was some super something when I was doing all that wrong and sinning if you do then God help you cuz you were lost brother BR said he was lost brother Bram said he used to sit and watch people go to church and and people don't like you to say this he said he washed his car on Sunday and watched people go to church a prophet why he wasn't born again it wasn't quickened if it was quickened to him he'd been in church I'm not going to say that no more it's Quicken to you you'll be in church I said it again then it became a living Soul listen listen when it knows what's right and wrong right then it's got just like Adam and Eve set before a tree of right and wrong why would he set a tree of right and wrong if you always was eternal in your soul you always were Eternal in God yes and he puts that Soul inside of you at a new birth yes it makes it Choice and then it becomes intelligent it grows all the time in God's Great economy and finally it comes down to the end of the road for this physical body now watch he takes you all through life and then here at the end of the road and just as this body is deteriorating and going away why cuz it was born in sin it was a product of sin but your flesh don't make you a sinner your flesh is not going to be judged amen your Soul's going to be judged judged your flesh is just going to be something there's attached to it that's right all right cuz remember if your flesh body goes to hell and starts burning as we call burning hell it' burn up in just a couple hours and be done with but it's not it's that Soul that's inside of you that's right everybody with me and just as this body is deteriorating and going away there's one being prepared to receive it where's it being prepared inside of you today amen inside of you today it's everybody say amen amen that's way it ought to sound just as soon it leaves here brother Donnie says if you're going to nod nod a little louder just as soon as it leaves here now look the soul that's in us now and this Spirit leaves this body and goes to another we know that a younger one but it just IM morphes out of this one because we can't take this one into that Dimension amen this body can't go into that Dimension it's slow and gets old and we can't go into that Dimension brother George cuz we're barred from that cuz that Dimension you're going to is without sin but your soul as soon as you die it go you don't have to open the door to let anybody out just like Jesus when he appeared to the disciples they didn't open the door he appeared through the wall in a flesh body but we don't take our flesh cuz our flesh was born wrong our flesh was born wrong so it can't go into that perfect Dimension but what you're building here today yes what you're building today goes into that Dimension either that one or that one five or six just as soon as it leaves here this Soul that's in us now the spirit leaves his body and goes to another younger one a good one a better one the one that won't get old or one that won't pass away he's a good god certainly is 1 Thessalonians 5:23 Paul says and the Very God of Peace sanctify you look holy yes w h o l l y all of you and I pray that your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless until the coming of our Lord Jesus cuz listen folks look Faithful Is He that calleth you who also will do it you can't do it yourself you can't raise your body you can do all kind of stuff work on your body now sorry temporary yes as my daddy always says red paint on an old barn Barn's still old but faithful is he that calleth you who also will do it sir so he's going to do it yes what we got to do get into that program if you're not in that program look the Bible says she's dead while she liveth yes all this world thinks they're so alive I'm living life oh I'm so alive remember that one brother randam was long time ago he this girl was half naked crawling through the thing with a beer bottle in or a liquor bottle in her hand oh this is life he said she did not know that was death but she called it life but she was living she was dead while she was living and I pray your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless until the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ you say all this old thing it's you're looking at here it's corrupt absolutely but faithful is he now listen Romans 8 says if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead it shall also Quicken another body no it says you're mortal body your mortal body is what you going to live in Jesus didn't pick up another flesh body when he came no he stood out there and he said all power and Heaven and Earth been given to this guy and when we take a body change we do the same thing all power in heaven is heaven and earth when we take a body change right here they drop 5 million atomic bombs and it won't hurt us yet we'll have flesh come on we're going to pick this same body up yes sir and it's going to be changed amen I've been listening to couple of versions and I want to sing this song maybe around Easter Ain't No Grave going to hold this body down Ain't No Grave going to hold this body down and at the end of it he says if you walked out I'm walking too if you walked out I'mma walk into all right he walked out of the Grave right he walked out of that grave I'm walk into if he walked out of that grave I'm walking to something you'd work on for about three more months right but There Ain't No Grave going to hold this body down they ain't bury you in the sea they put concrete 500 miles above you and mash you to the Earth and they never find a speck of you God knows exactly where you are he knows where Abraham is right now every little speck he was he'll bring it back that's my God that's my faithful God Amen and listen we need a temporary Resurrection every once in a while so he comes by and he heals us that's right he healed Lazarus didn't he Lazarus didn't pick up another body and bring it out of the Tomb did he hello somebody no he brought the one he was in yesl and I'll promise you one thing bless you I promise you one one thing you're not going to go out to the grave and look like it look like somebody dug you out yeah it's going to be a secret they're still going to walk up to your grave and they going to go well they still there ain't nothing going on I still see why it ain't even humped up now it's like sunk in and he's still down there or she no she ain't if she's res Direction happens that's right like I said before Jesus could have walked through that tomb and walked right out of the wall and walked right out of that rock and stood there but he did it as a sign he rolled that thing back with his fingertips he just rolled her back and walked out right here when that sacrifice is received by the fire and it goes up like that the smoke goes up you rise with your sacrifice into the heavenlies and you're sealed away from the things of the world then our souls on his altar now remember today like I said before we we talked about this several times your Soul's in another dimension if you're born again Heavenly places thinks different than the world sir makes you act different than the world where's that coming from it's emanating from you but that's eternal life now look what are you done what are you done then after you have been died then what are you to do then you are conceived a new I say what are you conceived of now you've con you're conceived of the Holy Ghost just like he was but you're not the fullness of the godhead B you're a portion just like I just like I proved with the with the cups mhm same eternal life but in a collection of a body we are the body of God we are the fullness of the godhead bodily all right but not one one person brother ROM was not the fullness of the godhead Bly he wasn't the son of man he was a son of man revealing the son of man well who's he revealing it to his bride cuz she is the son of man in a collective body then you are conceived the you are conceived in new you are first conceived in iniquity that's what we've been talking about now you're conceived in something new what is it the Living Word yes oh that changes it now doesn't it now we're through the struggle after seeing what you got to do now what happens you're conceived and new in the Living Word what is it the word becomes alive in you yes sir that word that was a baby at one time growed up gave his life so it could come back inside me and you yes and we can understand him and he can understand us the word becomes alive in you you begin to see things different where once you couldn't see that now you do see it there's something different now makes all the scriptures Hallelujah makes them all come together yes sir makes everything Dove tell just right then now something's beginning to happen yes now you die to your own thinking now you're conceived because you are Washed by the Water of the word where did your conception come from let me be plain not a bedroom Heaven your conception now comes from Heaven yes sir the Holy Ghost comes down watch this what do you do with the baby as soon as it's born you wash him is that right and as soon as a man has died to himself and born of God he's Washed by the Water of the world word if it says jesus' name you say jesus' name it says You must be born again you say the same thing every what God says you're washed by that water of the word now you're ready for life oh it was all good yeah no you're dead until you're alive in Jesus Christ now you're ready now for life you're ready to start out now our sister's going to a watery grave we're going to a funeral today something's going to die and we're going to bury it but we're going to raise in newness of life now you're born a new born in the family of God look with a new parent yes sir your tutors used to be now you got tutors that is now you got a new parent you can't be born without having a parent and who's your daddy at a new birth your father's your daddy amen who's your mother the Bible says new Jerusalem's your mother the mother of us all that's what the Bible says so if you're born in the Brotherhood of a church that's what you got if you're born in a Creed there you are but if you're born in God conceived by his word you got a new parent that's God ready to make his own word known Among Us with you speak it through you oh a new parent that parent is God am he's ready to take his word now that he's always spoke and lay it in you and make it come to life some of us need that hallu makes it come to life this is not life now look he says now you have your training now what we've been talking with 140 sermons that's your training that's your growing up time he says you're ready you're ready to go into training now child training that's the hard part when you think you ought to do this and the word Cuts you around and shows you something else while you believe that over that don't make any difference what they believe here's what God said you must be about the father's business just as Jesus said that you got say that too cuz your father is now God now you're getting born again again now you're getting right getting straightened out you have new parent so in order if you're born again and got a new parent then you got a new nature the old nature is dead you get a new nature Hallelujah that's why you'll fight if you're not born again you'll fight worse than you ever fought but when you get born again you'll fight worse than you ever fought was going to say something different didn't you no you fight you still got to fight cuz the way I see it is is you're so in tune with your own nature I hope y'all are living in the same well I hope you ain't living in this one but you're living in your body and you know what I'm talking about you fight your I don't fight sister Regina's nature okay I fight with her sometimes but nature to nature but I don't fight her nature she fights her own nature right you fight your own nature so that's an individual with God you fight even though God's changing your nature he's put a new part inside of you you still fight that old thing because remember we have a carnal mind because we go to memory reasoning conscious affection and imagination every single time what the Bible tell us to do cast down reasoning cuz you know what Paul fought the same thing you're fighting Paul literally had Christians killed Christians cuz when he was met on the road Jesus didn't say uh well you're now you're you're you're persecuting them Christians he said you're persecuting me you're persecuting me so it struck Paul he knew what the scripture said he knew what was going on as far as in the Christian world or the well not Christian for him but in that world of of law and all that other stuff he knew that when they when he said Lord and he said Paul you kicking me you're you're hurting me through these people he knew there had been a transformation somewhere and I know by the power of the Holy Ghost he said I want that same transformation do you this morning want that same transformation you do you want to what you want Den die all that that you used to do you want deny you don't want to persecute Christians anymore you got a new nature Paul got a new nature but look Paul didn't just come up and go Paul didn't just come up out of that dust and stood up brother Herman he said oh I see it now what' he have when he stood up scales on his eyes somebody had to lead him into a city oh this man wrote 80% of the New Testament he was a prophet Church A's messenger blind yes blind he was blind spiritually and naturally but what he have to do he had to go meet ance yes which had the Holy Ghost cuz an I was scared to death I'm sure he's like Paul God you sure we we've been trying to hide from this guy we've been trying to get away from him and you're sending him to my house he did what God told him to do he said you lay your hands on that man and what the Bible say when he laid hands on him the scales fell off of his eyes and then he began to what for years he went took the Old Testament he didn't just jump up and start preaching come on somebody he took the Old Testament he knew that Old Testament but what he done was is he found that Jehovah the old was Jesus of the new just like brother Ram said now look you once was going one way now you're going another way you once was going this way down now you're you're going this way up your affections are set on things above a new affection you don't love the things of the world no more your affections of God you don't care what man says how they laugh at you and you say you're an old model or whatever like that you don't care because you're born from above your affections are set on things above God's not ashamed of you and you're not ashamed of him let me get this right here this the last one last Fe Mis names 1962 watch how he words this the church is the mystical Body of Christ all right Shake Yourself just for a minute this the last quote then we'll sing a song go take have a baptismal service born of the Breath of God now listen God gave you a soul and a spirit when you became a a a b baby that I'm looking at now all right but it wasn't Eternal I just told you that you're not eternal you're not born Eternal you're born dead but that Soul's got to make a choice by the transforming power of the Holy Ghost sometime in your life if you get the new birth it transfers you just like I said you got a new set of parents you got a new place to go and you're born brother John you're born to the Breath of God he literally breathes into you all did you get it congregation says amen the Church of God is born of the Breath of God God breathed breath into the nostrils spiritually of Adam and he became a living Soul we know Adam had eternal life in his soul we know that right did you know the Pentecostals or the true Pentecostal church is born of the Breath of God let me read you something just a minute what he reads is is St John 161 19-20 what it is is I'll read it here in a second see whether the church is born of the Breath of God or not like Adam was in the beginning watch and the same day in evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut and the disciples were s for fear of the Jews Jesus came and stood in the midst of them W peered right over didn't even have to open the door and said Peace be unto you and when he had so said he showed them his hands and his side he's quoting scripture here then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord and then said Jesus to them peace be unto you as my father has sent me so I send you watch the father that sent him went in him and Jesus when he sends the disciple he goes in him same one sent God now look and when he had said this he breathed on them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost now remember they didn't receive the Holy Ghost right then I didn't bring the quote brother R said that was a promise right cuz cuz the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost Giver was standing there and and he couldn't have they couldn't be the body of Christ and his body standing there he had to go away so that he could come back and they become the body of Christ Church born of the Breath of God this whole church this year I want us born by the Breath of God if God gives us Liberty and he gives us time to preach it I'm going to preach it the whole year we're going to be a church born by the Breath of God not born by the breath of something else when this stature has mold look has molded itself up there in condition God's breath breathes upon them receive ye the Holy Ghost then you are a son of God you can join anything you want to but you're born into the the Church of the Living God born by the Breath of God God breathed upon them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost oh my there you are not come and join put your name in there be a message believer and with your soup suppers and all goes with you you join a lodge you can join a Methodist Lodge Baptist Lodge P Lodge Catholic Lodge Pentecostal Lodge anything you want to join but you're joining a lodge but when you become a child of God you are born by the Breath of God Eternal God better leave it alone right there now all right he was feeling some resistance let's stand to our feet deity resides in a Christian deity resides in The Bride of Jesus Christ deity comes to church deity reads his Bible deity praise yes deity studies you saw brother that's too much no we ain't got close enough yet I'm back to that scripture again I've been all for three or four days Paul said one time he stood and he said until Christ be formed in you until Christ be formed in you cuz we're built in the image of of God but you're an individual God don't want you to look like him no we're all different he wants you to act like him he don't want you to look like him he wants you to act like him cuz we can't all look like that man right there cuz you we have females right Ryan couldn't grow a beard if he was paid to maybe in a 3 or four months but you understand what I'm saying he looks at the inside guy that inside God's Eternal it's young it never will it never has got old we're heading toward it but I'm looking at it right now and you're going to portray what's inside of you let's sing a song but just realize you're born by the breath of almighty God in moments like these sing I sing out to my Jesus in moments like these oh I lift up my hands yes I lift up my hands to you Lord you believe it though you believe [Music] it love you you love him oh what a love AAR you think you love your natural parent you love you wife not a drop in the bucket of what this is we I'm singing I Love You Lord oh [Music] oh in Moment Like These I sing s oh I sing out a love song to Jesus moments like these Lord I lift up my hands yes I lift up my hands to you Lord oh sing in I Love You Lord I'm singing and I love you Lord I'm sing it I love [Music] you oh I [Music] love try I'll be all right all right go ahead buddy you good yeah on December 10th 1994 when I was in the bathroom just kind of straightening up my wife was sick she called me and said come here [Music] I went in the room and sit down where she was as what she want she never said a word after I got there so I guess a few my uh nephew came over my nephew's son to visit and uh she began to cough so we tried to give give her a oan she wouldn't take it and a few minutes where I was just sitting there I guess iwh around 12:30 in the in the afternoon the nurse had told me if her feet start to get cold and everything she life is leaving and um by that time uh real smooth white looking light came across just below her knees and it moved up a body moved all the way up until it when it reached somewhere up here by naked it lifted off and when it lifted off life left the body and uh so it was just a hard time but we had talked few days before but she said everything was all right amen and that uh she never left she only left one thing cuz I keep this to myself but she only left one thing she told me not to do and so I try to remember that wish amen but uh that's all and some days I miss her and others you know I don't but I just ask just pray that God give me strength to move on and the time is closer than ever before amen and so thank God right amen I didn't realize that but that's been a while you know I've always said just for a minute we got all day as Christians we are different than the world so in another dimension they look into this Dimension and they see we're different I I just believe that now remember Christians can't die Christians cannot die they move into another place brother Brown said it does not change you it changes your what Your Dwelling Place so the Old Death Angel comes down to get you he takes Millions a day and throws them into that Fifth Dimension don't care a thing it's just a job for him he just throws them over in there I'll promise you one thing that dirty death angel don't come get you if you're a Christian as a white light comes as a white light comes into that room and it takes you and it puts you in an eternal dimension one that that Death Angel cannot occupy because there's no death over here only death over here so sister Ruth that white light swirled around just took her picked this what we were talking about just took that soul and just set it right over in another dimension and that old angel said Death Angel no this is not yours this one's mine this one's mine I'm Michael I've conquered they've accepted me you go stay over there I'm taking this one in to my Dimension my Dimension is the Eternal Dimension that's the difference you say it's a fairy tale okay you stay the way you are and you try to figure out about 3 seconds before you pass away from this Earth that's about the lifetime you going to have an opportunity and 3 seconds maybe too late but sister Ruth made her way long time ago she knew she was fine you talk to any uh uh several uh morticians they'll tell you they know when a Christian comes in and when a sinner comes in yeah complete different look on the on the face complete different he said there's no fight they're at rest even in death even in death God shows he's alive inside of you even in this thing right here if it goes away don't worry brother collie you miss sister Ruth but you'd never bring her back here not in the condition she was in with the cancer and different things you wouldn't bring her back here she could be right back heing that suffering again but oh praise God there's going to be one day there's going to be one day when that trumpet's going to sound we're listening to it now yes sir but that grave is going to open up it's not going to open up like this like you took a shovel what the dimension's going to open up they're going to rush in pick up their body stand here and we we'll see the ones that we know here we'll see sister Ruth that's why we got her down she's downstairs if you want to see her her picture's downstairs when she was young young lady we won't see an old one person no more we won't see Robert Tatum that his hands were racked with um with arthritis so bad that he couldn't hardly shake his hand this way you saw him last when I was a little kid I thought brother Tatum was like 9 ft tall cuz he stood straight and I was a little bitty kid but right before he passed away I was t him cuz death does take you down but praise God there's one inside you better make it right we ain't got long let's sing it one more time flow through

give your Holy Ghost away you can give somebody opportunity to feed off of yours ain't that what I nias did Paul fed off his Holy Ghost and Paul received the Holy Ghost because he had to go to where the life was he didn't go out there in the desert all them people were probably unbelievers they were going to kill Christians so I guess they were unbelievers but God had to get him in an atmosphere come on somebody God had to get him in an atmosphere to where he could deal with him that's right that's the same way with us he has to get us in a place to where he can deal with us and sometimes it may be a a a place that you that you you don't you can't figure God out but I'll promise you one thing God is not the author of confusion he's not the author of Chaos he's the author of peace and he'll give you peace in your heart as this as the song says in the midst of the storm not before not after in the middle of it he'll give you peace I pray for peace today remember peace on Earth peace on what this Earth I would there won't be peace on this Earth till till the new till the new city comes so we got thousand years or more for peace to be on this Earth but you can have peace on this earth right now today today yes sir that passes what all understanding oh I don't quit just accept God accept what he's done even what he's already done praise him for it I was reading the scripture
