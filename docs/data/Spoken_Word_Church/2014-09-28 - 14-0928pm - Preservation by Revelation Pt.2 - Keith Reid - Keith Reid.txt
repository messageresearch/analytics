turn again our Bibles to the Book of Genesis uh I'm going to read uh from 41 and verse 55 brother make the adjustment we we want to look at the effect of the economic recession and see how um it was by God and how God has preserved his people through all of this really um you know it says that God will put it in their heart to fulfill his will and and these things could not be where it struck the entire world and God not have a hand in it amen and and always it it is not to bring down the people of God but to bring out our glory amen and sometimes the way that God has to do it it's not the way

Lord God there's just one God that we look to Lord God and we thank you that you're omnipresent and you're omniscient oh God in your ways and Lord God we we we we nurse from you God tonight Lord we pray that oh God you'd come on the seene and Lord God may you bless your children and speak to the lips that oh speak through the lips of clay oh God that hearers might hear and Lord God we might know the day that you have prepared for us oh God bless us now as we look to you and believe you in Jesus name we pray amen and amen amen in verse 55 and when all the land of Egypt was famished the people cried to Pharaoh for bread and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians go unto Joseph what he say to you do that's a position and the famine was over all the face of the Earth and Joseph opened the storehouses and sold unto the Egyptians and the famine walks sore in the land of Egypt and all countries came unto Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn because that the famine was so sore in the land and we move to 4 42 now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt Jacob said unto his son why do you look one upon another and he said behold I've heard that there is corn in Egypt get you down thither and and buy for us from hence that we may live and not die and Joseph 10 Brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt but Benjamin Joseph BR Joseph's brother Jacob sent not with his brethren for he said L per Adventure Mischief befall him and the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came for the famine was in the land of Canaan right and Joseph was a governor over the land and and he was that uh and and it was that sold to all the people of the land and Joseph Brethren came and bowed on themselves before him with their faces to the hurt may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated so you you know it started that Joseph had received this quot and and by that he he was given this gift of dreams and the interpretation of dreams and and so he had these dream that he begin to tell his Brethren what he dreamed never even might be looking at it right that that I see you know the and and and and they begin to interpret you know we're going to bow down before you and they're saying to Joseph you know these things can't be we we can't see that much in you that we're going to Bow ourselves down before you and and you know it make them angry with him because it it seems like he was taking too much upon himself you've heard those words before but he couldn't help it because he had the dream and he was really telling them what God had showed to him and so that that angered them really but it's not Joseph it's God right amen and if God has selected you it's not you it's God right and you can only say that which God has put in your mouth to say you you can only speak of that which God has done in your midst really right and and and so they you know though they did not like it but it's not his doing it's God's doing we we see also that in 41 we see that Joseph now taking a wife and when he took that wife he had two sons and you know it's interesting in scripture the way things go it's not like you know the way we do things just aply but God has a purpose for everything right you know Joseph when he had the first son he called his name manesa and and and that says for God said he has made me forget my toil of all my father's house he had to forget those things that were behind him right hello because if you carry the baggage of yesterday you can't move forward in God Amen you've got to leave some things behind you and then then the the the birth of the second was Ephraim and then in Ephraim for God has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my Affliction so so where they they brought him down to Egypt for affliction that becomes a blessing right for God will make your trials becomes your blessing is that right amen you you've got to take it the right way if if we started cry and said God why me why God why why me God why you have to do if you start to get angry with God but listen when you when you accept that which God has done then God can make that that that that trial a blessing is that right hallelujah amen so he walked from it and and then as he walked from it God bless him Hallelujah then we find out the famine down there in Egypt it was Progressive the the the seven years the the the the the years of plenty all the Earth had seen all of this then slowly the famine begin to you know take the land and you know it seemed like it started the far away land because it went down and the Bible says and then the famine was in Egypt so it it it was you you heard it way off and then before you know it it was right there where you are we heard these things I remember the the years when it it was Brazil's economy and and they didn't know what to do and then it was Argentina you know under the IMF and and they couldn't just manage themselves but then you you you see a kind of famine in in economic recession and was moving over the Earth we've seen that you know since uh uh 911 it it seems like that would have started a Great Famine but what it did it boost the the the the world's economy for a while and since 2001 to 07 we've seen you know um people buying houses the economy booming people's business begin to move it's a great time for everybody amen and that's on the natural but in the spiritual God was was showing us things and and saying to Us store of the food right is it right it is time for you to know your possession it is time to you to get start settled in the word of God because I'm going to do something new yeah hello and we can see we can watch this progression in the word of God by Revelation a mean little things that we had there in the word that mightbe we have glanced and we glean over them then we start to take these things and and put them in their right perspective hello and we realize that God was really doing something Among Us amen hallelujah so there it Isen Genesis is typing our time Pharaoh's dream was really God saying something to them but it was all in symbols Hallelujah and you find that it took a man Hallelujah that was anointed by God am me to take that dream and and to put it now in perspective and we've got to be careful of these things sometimes because you know people come and said well well you know I've got a dream and I've got this and I've got that Hey listen amen it's not every dream for the church hello amen I got to say that it's not every dream means something right am me I've got dreams and and it didn't mean anything right I remember when the girls were here you know we we certainly thank you back there for the gift that you have sent to us amen we a k h a mixer board and and you did send one and you know when they came we were at the airport and you know that morning before we had gone to the airport we wake up early in the morning and you know we lied there and frany was telling me her dream and her dream was two numbers and you know I was kidding with her really and and she was saying that you know the dream whatever it was I don't remember at all but you know it was two numbers like it was 35 and 16 and I said man maybe you got to buy the lry you you know I I was just joking with her like that really and so you know I I just tell the way it is I joke sometimes I know some of you don't but I I joke sometimes you know and and so we we went to the airport and we waited and you know the place was full and and it got hemp and and we couldn't see these two girls coming and we wondering I mean that they we don't see like their phones are on or anything and and then you know when I saw them you know I said Francy something's not right because one once one thing with my girl when you look at their face you can read a lot of things and so you know money came out and she said you know they said there's no Duty for this thing but we got to pay $35,000 and you know I I said okay money come we we we just go talk to them really and you know when you put something in the hands of God you just leave it there really I know everything's going to be all right and so you know I went over the custom lady and she was still a little bit you know fum me and I said okay just be calm just be calm and you know you smile and Nod and you know I I said you know and explain the situation really and when the guy brought the thing in really I I started to see what happened you know the box was a brand new box but the equipment was older and so they didn't they didn't look at the equipment they look at the box and and they were start charging us the duty on the box because it was a you know they went on the net and they and so you know so he said it was $35,000 said well check you know when he opened it now he realized that the equipment wasn't new so when he looked now and and I said to him I said so how much I'm I'm going to pay you know and he said just wait a little wait on the cashier and and when they when they saw saw everything out and come he said said oh it's going to be $16 $116,000 so you know I was there lying down and as she's telling me this dream and you know I don't remember what the dream is you know you know women dream all the time bro you know and so you know I didn't know what it is but it's 35 and 16 and she couldn't remember whether it should have been 35 or 16 but when I went there and after I paid for it I said 35 and 16 God you know what you're doing am amen amen hallelujah that's right but you see these things are established by God am mean why it happened the way it happen sometimes you don't even know but I tell you when God put something in place you can't even pray it away is that right it's by the for knowledge of God and and God say it it's going to be that way and it's God's business and you can't move it from there right but notice there in the scripture amen it says Pharaoh said unto the Egyptians the the the famine is now coming home so he said to them they said Pharaoh we ain't got no bread you're the man we ain't got no bread but Pharaoh said to them he said go onto Joseph because there is a man here that has the word of God hallelujah amen you go to Pharaoh hallelujah what he say to you do it right Hallelujah Brethren listen we're now in Egypt but we got a Joseph hello somebody amen and we're the Brethren and we're going to come home in time but there is a word of God for you and I we're ain't going to listen to the system because there is a man that speak the word of God and whatever he say to you just do it amen hearing him hallelujah amen the prophet begin to pull these things out of the word this is my son hearing him oh your adoption yes sir remember it's a age hallelujah it's not amen there there is it's not just natural bread but we're in the time when hallah there's a fine for the spiritual food in due season amen where amen there there a challenge there there's a showdown over the food amen they said oh it's got to be this way me you've got to come through this Camp me if you ain't seen it like this me you're not going to see it was there before right except you be converted and keep the laws of Moses you can never be saved is that right amen but I tell you the word of God is n thee even in thy mouth amen the Bible said You shall know your God and you shall do great exploits we're not looking for something to come it's already here oh Glory Hallelujah God promised to provide and multiply the bread right in the season do you believe that amen hallelujah so amen here it is and we know that the bride amen when it come to this time she will come and speak in terms with the word right is that right am me you're going to get back to the time where hallelujah amen he said speak the word and I will perform it uh amen it means that uh amen you're not just out there on the outside somewhere amen but there's an invisible Union amen the keys of David amen that brought the marriage together amen the bride and Christ amen as become one amen where the bride is getting under the token of the word of God for her day amen she's under headship amen she know where she ought to stand she know the portion of the word amen that is allotted to her amen she's not just speaking Revelation 101 or Revelation 10:7 but she's preing Revelation 108 to1 amen my word for I take the book amen the little book and I heat all of it amen you got to take the word of God for yourself uhen you got to know the portion of the word amen that is for you right because the authority is invested in the bride Hallelujah so this famine amen it was coming over all the Earth Hallelujah but there was something happening amen there was astronaut power amen being invested somewhere amen though they were not fainting no sir amen Jacob said listen amen I hear that there is you wonder how he heard amen but people were going to and fro from mean passing Canaan and they were talking amen over in Egypt amen there is bread he didn't put any there amen he didn't know what happened but he did not know amen that the one that he had loved amen was back

there's a Time coming uh amen where you're going to have need for that food uhen and God preserve it before time uh amen that when you come to that position amen God is already ahead of you amen thank you Lord why worry about tomorrow when tomorrow is in God's hand hello somebody amen you know brother de things that you read and you preaching years ago and me mightbe you didn't realize why you preach it the people couldn't see why you preach it me people were right there with a prophet and they heard things preach and they didn't understand it but today right those things are coming into manifestation Hallelujah the astronaut power Hallelujah am is going to get everything in order amen amen and we're coming about the time the sign of Life Hallelujah Sarah is going to conceive strength right are you there oh we talked about these things before they were right there with us uh amen now we're coming to themen it's a fear now amen real in amen that which he did yesterday the dream that he had and now it's coming into manifestation and the same one that could interpret the symbols of the dream then God is on that man and God will work through him so he said go unto Joseph whatever he say unto you do it right Hallelujah right amen so now Pharaoh is decreasing and I say that because I want you to know that when we come to this state this this system is going to decrease yes sir we're not looking to government for our substenance we're not looking for the system Amen to Amen to create something for us uh amen but we realize we're getting towards that squeeze where the Prophet says uh Hallelujah you got to speak to the elements amen so you've got to look now whatever is inside of you are you there with me amen I'm not looking at their faces uh I'm not looking at their response uh amen I know that the god God who I serve am me he's able is that right Hallelujah and he's already have a way worked out for his people amen yes sir so God hallelujah amen God's now working by and through the bride it's Joseph time the manifestation of the sons of God hallelujah so whatever I say to you that you're going to do hallelujah amen so now Hallelujah when the amen when the famine reached Canaan that's where God's people are Hallelujah so he tell them now amen go go to egyp Hallelujah father I hear that there's corn there in Egypt amen but little Benjamin let him stay right here oh and I wish we had time to get into all of that but what is itth amen we're coming now to the third seal me being manifested aen a measure of Wheat and a measure of B see th touch not the the oil and the wine the stimulation of Revelation amen because we are going to need that that's for the bride right is that right hallelujah it's not jumping and shouting and all of that uh amen but the word of God that will mature you and settle you in this time so you're not looking for something over there somewhere Hallelujah you know that all that you've got need of you've got itth is that right uh so the word that you have already received now it's time to apply that word amen so whereby we were saying that oh I must speak to my problems uh amen I must speak to my problem no don't worry about just speak it right is that right he me you know people think that oh you got to get all worked up in God and you got to do this no amen just speak the word and keep moving exactly is that right just say the Worden we've got we want to take time to think about it amen I I want to think about this word of Prophecy amen I want to think about this word amen I want to make sure that I'm in the right frame no God has already put you in the frame right sometimes when we take time to think about it then doubt set in y amen just say what you mean God knows exactly what you have need of is that right Hallelujah so Joseph Brad she's not dismissed yet but she's coming to that time when she's going to be dismissed because his Brethren is coming to him oh we can turn that over to the amen the Feast of trumpet Amen to see the time that we're in hallelujah amen when the trumpet called them back amen into Hallelujah and they're coming to meet Joseph uh amen where will the bride be uh amen she's going to be the palace there somewhere all these things are type A of what we're going through we're coming to that time so Joseph he's now in Union right Hallelujah he has a key of David Joseph has a new name Hallelujah so he's walking in this new name it's not the whole person of yesterday am me like God show you that with Abraham when he called Abraham for his final test he said Abraham not Abraham take thy son thy only son you they say what about ishmail amen that was Hallelujah before the promise before the victory won hallelujah amen when he went up on the mountain amen even the angel know that his name was changed he said Abraham lay not your hands upon the lad and the prophet of God said Hallelujah Abram never asked for a ram but that's what he needed at that time and God provided it amen so when you get to your final test it's not what you ask for God knows exactly what you need and God will provide it amen am because you know the Bible say we don't even know what we have to pray for right cuz I don't know what way to it is to go so I'm praying for one thing and and God's mind is the other way amen but whatever you have need of God will provide it what a confidence you have in God hallelujah hallelujah amen so the same man that was in prison yes sir it's now the man with the spirit of God inside of him right that's what Pharaoh say hallelujah man who has gone through a time of suffering a measure of suffering Hallelujah am me his characteristic must have been really altered by the things that he go through I've been to prison yeah he you know that crush your pride Hallelujah but that's the God man that God wanted hallelujah amen so in the midst of the disturbance yes in the midst of the famine Joseph is remembering now amen what he had preached on years ago and you remember he had preached a message that God had given to him how your brethren is going to bow down before you you and know he was ridiculed for that message that he had preached are you there with me amen because they didn't believe him nobody know that it was was what God showed him to preach and he preached exactly what God Said and he left it there Amen in all these years they had lost amen Association because of what he had preached amen but now it's coming into manifestation and me he did not know what the famine all of the would bring but now that the famine is here the same word that he was ridiculed for that brought the spiritual disturbance me now that same word causing his Brethren Amen to come before him when they come before the Bible says and Joseph was governor over in Egypt and you can't face the governor without your bow down before him exactly that's right amen right Hallelujah way God works things just in Simplicity you you don't get excited about it no you you don't have to do anything just believe God's word amen and take confidence in God's word hallelujah amen you know sometimes I find people you know they might be sick and and they keep talking about you know I'm I'm Healed God heal me and many times they saying that so much because they're in fear yeah that's right and so they're trying to works up to let them believe themselves but you don't have to do that just take the promise of God right hallelujah amen amen you know God can move you past anything anything God can let you move past you know I remember just a few weeks ago in church you know I was on a certain subject and you know Sister you know she said you know 3 years ago or so she went to the doctor and and she was diagnosed with W with sugar diabetes and she said you know Lord you know I didn't ask for this and Lord you know I don't I don't want it and you know so they put her on a strict diet and and medication and so and she said one good thing she couldn't afford none of that so she said she put it all in the hands of God and and she went and she believed that well you know if God don't do something I'm going to die because I ain't going to take none of this really because I have no way of taking it and so you know she she went back to the doctor years after and she went back to her same doctor the doctor said Hey listen she pull her file and she said oh yeah so you're you're on your medication no you're on your dot no and so the doctor says you know you're walking in serious business now this is serious you you know you ought not to do this to yourself so the doctor you know start all over again and let her do all the test and everything really am me to see how father that she's gone and he said when she brought back the test she said the doctor jumping up and Sh and praising the Lord because said I don't know what happened but you don't have it no more amen if you will believe God you will walk away from it amen and you don't have to tell nobody because people are walking around and telling everybody so they little more leap sugar diabetes becomes a great mountain and they can't cross over it amen that's right you know everybody that knows about it give you their opinion and everybody that knows about give you a remedy that you you can work with hello and everybody and nobody's telling you Hey listen just walk away from it am it amen so we move now to chapter 43 and the famine was sore in the land now I want to show you that uh what the Bible begin to tell us is that the the famine start from one area and it begins to spread and you know there's something about famine really means scarcity and in the scarcity when when food scarce then the price go up a and so the privileged can reach it and those that are not so privileged can't reach it but but in Egypt the the store houses were filled so everybody had to go into to Egypt they had to go to the city they had to go to the system they had to take the Mark is that right Hallelujah and if you read those scripture you see also that Joseph had had engineer it a certain way that the people when they gave when they came to Egypt and their money was out the Bible says and the money fa isn't that what he said the money fa they didn't have no more money because they were paying more money for the little that they need until all their money was spent then Joseph tell them bringing your possession give all your possession to Egypt right hello and they gave their houses their land their C they give everything to Egypt and brother way when all that was finished Joseph tell them give yourself to Egypt sell yourself now to the system so they were belonging to the system and there was nothing they could do about it and the Bible tells us about the mark of the beast right and every man whose name is not written in the Lamb's Book of Life shall take the Mark is that right right so I I can show you that only those of Joseph family right weren't sold out to the system but Joseph LED them do it right it's a sign of the time right and you said brother how will that be it's going to be that everything they horn is going to be horned by the bank and the bank belong to the system and so the system hold them that they can't do anything without somebody dictate to them and tell them what they ought to do right I I've seen our country go back to the IMF because we just can't manage ourselves it means that the politicians are fail yeah and so when you when you go to the IMF that's the international monetary system what they do is that they they said well the the policies that you have of all feel so we're going to set you on a part to recovery or to self-management and so they begin to tell you exactly what you ought to do right and so they free freeze wages right and you ain't going to get no wage the wage increase no matter what you do because the government who might be paternalistic they can't do it because they become slave to a system and they can't break the rules of the system or else they'll hold back the green back we call it and they can't pay for goods and service so they belong to the system and there's no way out of it and so when when wages are not raising and and people can't reach out to other so they go to the system and begin to borrow from the system and when they borrow from the system the system has take their equity and their Equity is tied into the system and they can't get out of it and that's why many business people overnight they kill themselves right they don't know what to do they can't manage they realize they've just lost control but Brethren I tell you you don't worry about the system me we've got a God there is a Joseph in Egypt the spirit of the Lord is on and he's got the word of God amen hallelujah amen glory so you know oh I look at it like this you know so we we we find that since 01 207 we had great increase people were Hing houses not house but houses yeah who never thought they could have own a house in the first place right the American economy was booming and so the bubble was coming bigger and bigger and they were getting fat checks and and the CEOs and everybody and they were living it up and then what happened the system collapsed and it made or hit prophecy because it's s years of feast then seven years of famine right then in mid 8 everything beginning to shut down foreclosures coming in and you're losing control of what you had and those who had yesterday realize that they ain't got nothing because everything was tied into the system and the system took everything that they've got isn't that the way it is right and then from all8 According to prophecy it's got to be seven years yeah hello yeah but at the end of the the seven years of famine hello then you notice what's going to happen Breen I tell you what the message is for your preparation yes sir hello at the end of that seven years he mean what happened Joseph now was calling in his Brethren right amen because I've got something for you the one you had rejected the word you rejected the prophecies you rejected now those prophecies are being fulfilled right amen we got to watch where we are because Brethren I tell you we're at the time of another change again where where where you had to have it or you don't have it you either Believe it or you don't believe it amen is

and they were looking at the famine and you know the Bible said 45 and five no therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourself that he sold me either for God did send me before you to preserve life for those years has the famine being for those two years as a famine being in in the land now there were five more years to come but he was taking confidence in what God gave him right amen amen that's right two years five more to go but I'm taking confidence in what God said because now David mean I'm sorry Jo Joseph was now seeing it manifest his vision that which I preach me he was 17

read of all men uh amen the word of God is not going to be something in the little message book uh on the pages of the Bible but the word of God is going to beny thee even in thy mouth uh amen he going to give you a new language uh when you speak uh me the world don't understand you because you speak the revelation of Jesus Christ uh me you're coming into image uh Hallelujah you're coming into briad material uh me you're walking uh Hallelujah the principles of the word of God uh we no longer have to preach a clothline Doctrine amen because the Holy Ghost in you have moved that from you you are separated from all that uhen you're now sold out to the word uh and whatever is not the word uhen I've taken a walk from it uh amen because I know whom I believing and I'm persuaded that he's able to keep that which have committed unto him against that day when going to church is not just one of the things that we do amen but but the church and the word of God becomes a central theme of Our Lives I show them that in the in the wilderness the Tabernacle that they placed there in the middle of them it wasn't just a symbol of all the symbols around them no the place where they place to Hallelujah to the cardinal direction of the Tabernacle it was just something somewhere that they go because they wanted to go the Tabernacle was a central theme of their lives and the word of God has got to become the central theme of our lives uh amen whatever we do in business whatever work we do whatever we do for pleasure the word of God is a central theme of our lives uh it is that why we breathe uh and have our beings uh are you there with me everything that I do everywhere that I go every conversation that I have uh I've got this one thing amen that the word of God I I can forget lunch uh amen I can forget to eat my meals uh but the word of God has got to be so much in me that I cannot walk away from it uh I cannot walk out of it uh hallelujah it's not just a second thought uh it's a central theme of my every being uh amen Brethren brother chist that's what you are in this day uh amen the word of God Amen Encompass your entire life right amen husbands the way you respond to your wife and wives the way you treat your husband and children the way you respond to your parents is because of the word of God and parents the way you respond to your children is because of the word of God exactly right that is what keep the family unit because that is secondary to the family of almighty God because God give us this promise that all that you love and all that love you is going to be there oh you can't take us away from that promise Hallelujah exactly and we thank God he s us a prophet who says am me that the dog who he love and the horse that he love was there on the other side what about your children and how do you treat them how do you how do you respond to them I tell you they H cast the world see them as nothing amen but they're a part of you for the Bible said for I'll save you and your household believe on the Lord Jesus and thou and thy household shall be saved can you believe God for that can you believe God for your husband wives can you believe God for your wives can you believe God for your children hello that's a word that we believe it Compass Encompass your everything because it's tied up in the love of God and he can't take away that which you love that's what we've been taught Hallelujah and so we begin to love one another a mean we we we have a problem with a personality of the brother but that has nothing to do with it we hate sin right Hallelujah but those personalities are different we put that out because listen we're living to go one place and we're going to spend eternity together oh Hallelujah am I want to for forgive my children if they're wrong I want to forgive my church I want them to forgive me I want if any you were taken with a fault in the spirit of meekness love I want to have the the heart of restoration am Hallelujah I don't want you to miss it I I don't want nothing on this side to hinder you if there's anything I'm going to give up amen that you see Christ Jesus Hallelujah in this hour that's what I want to do amen because I realize that the hour is later and whatever we do now we got to do it quickly are you there with me oh God's looking for a people oh who will sigh and cry over the abomination of the city and people will sigh cry and sigh amen because things are not the way that it is uh because the enemy is making foothold into your lives and among your families uh amen and all that uh amen don't turn your back on that uh amen let me tell you challenge him by the word of God because that which come out of your mouth is going to be power Hallelujah are you there with me me God as Polar as us with astronaut faith brother way you're going to speak the word and whatever you say it's coming out of your desire and your desire is going to materialize you see God moving amen when will we stop believing that right when did we that is a promise that God has given to us uh where did it started when you were called cuz everything that you got need of is in the birth and the message of the hour is your preparation is that right things are going to fail hello businesses will fail hello but if all that we leave with is our lives then we've got all that we have need of on this side because I tell you you ain't going to carry the possessions of the side with you right amen all that you're going to leave behind because we promise a greater glory than what we see on this side give it all up for the word of God give it all up for the prosperity of the word give it all up that the word of God hallelujah is full power we're powered like astronauts in this day Hallelujah do you believe him Hallelujah so what we're going through we're going through the hour of Temptation the Bible said that will come upon all all the Earth is that right amen and you said brother ke wats in this hour your children sometimes they they don't do what the word of God says they don't want to follow the word love loved ones that you've got they they just don't see it but but I tell you God has given you promises Hallelujah and those promises are in your heart oh Joseph oh they said what about your brethren I don't talk about them for what they did to me I I can't talk about them they're back there in Canaan somewhere when God gave him the two sons God was giving him signs signs manasa that that God hallelujah I forget those things that happened in my father's house I got to walk past that I got to walk past the strain that we had yesterday and the problems that we had yesterday we couldn't deal with each other and then he said H God give him Ephraim and in Ephraim he said Hallelujah God's going to bless me in the land of my captivity amen amen what great blessings you can have than what God gave to job his family on the other side right amen hallelujah and so you're looking and you're worrying about different things worrying not going to change anything it's all there in the promise of God yeah I ain't going to worry about it I just put it in the hands of God and I leave it right there amen and God say it and I'm going to be troubled with it Hallelujah I put it there at the altar and I leave it there and God will take care of them you just keep loving and God's going to bring it to pass so Genesis is paralleling the Book of Revelation Hallelujah so at the end of the famine Egypt had weal Hallelujah because the people sell all that they had to Egypt but I tell you one thing Egypt was destined to be destroyed and the only thing that's going to come out of Egypt is the people of God are you there with me all that's going to destroyed but there's a
