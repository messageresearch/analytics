========================================

foreign foreign foreign and then we will go to first John 5. John 3 first John 5. remember now the Bible study will be this coming Saturday six o'clock so remember that and be much in prayer that the Lord would be with all of us and come and be with us have a good time any other announcements ideally forget something I didn't give it to my template said the subject will be ties oh yeah the subject is going to be tidy yeah we're gonna have a subject on this one timing right right you know right before you put the money and I get it yeah you know while you're laughing let me say something to you that's going to be embarrassing but now Brothers uh in the urinal in the bathroom the water's supposed to go in the middle of it you know and out not all over the wall and the floor so uh how about watching that are amen you find a lot of hoes you know and that's embarrassing for a preacher to have to bring it out of here but then maybe you'll listen to it if I say it you know I mean John 3 first John 5. pray before we read father we thank you we love you and we ask you to just message each and every one of us in your love just have your way with us tonight forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and let your love be made manifest in each one of our hearts and lives we love you and we thank you and we ask you to just Lord have your way with us as we read your word you come and speak to her heart because we want to do the best that we can do and then depend upon you to be the answer to everything we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen John three there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except the man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus sent them to him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's wound and be born Jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born to water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born to the spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I said unto thee you must be born again and then we'll go over to first John 5. verse 6 through 8. this is he that came by water and blood even Jesus Christ not by water only but by water and blood it is the spirit that bears witness because the spirit is truth for there are three that by record in heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one there are three that bear witness in the Earth excuse me in a redo right there are three that by our record in heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one now watch it and there are three that bear Witness one is a record the other one is a witness one's in heaven other one is here on the Earth all right there are three that bear witness in Earth the spirit and the water and the blood and these things agree in one you may be seated the Lord has blessing to the reading of the word no we've been talking about what is the new birth you know and you can ask most people even ask churches you know what is the new birth and well I'll tell you this and want to tell you it's that and the other tell you the other things and and whatever it is it you will uh have many many different uh answers and so is it with the people of the message or the hour that you ask them and you listen to them and you go to this church and they'll teach it one way and it starts that way and all about one thing which is the new birth but uh you know I want us to think on these things and to be able to see the the the importance of it and then you know see whether or not you have the the new birth all right and we tried to cover their Sunday in a lengthy service in the afternoon I'm sorry but it was a little empty but yet trying to get a point to you to show the uh what would you call it the overlay or whatever of brother Reynolds message and the Bible to show that it verifies that uh your new birth begins when you repent right amen justification repentance and your new birth begins right there all right now that doesn't mean that you you stop if you stop at that point you got a problem amen but then you've got sanctification where that you're going to the cleansing and setting aside of the vessel all right and then you come down to the basis of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the birth all right now that way we want to cover it to keep it in line because like I tried to explain you you run around them is preaching an overall message to uh people and he's trying to explain a lot of things and trying to get his message across and he said I've always on on the future home there two times he said right I've always taught three stages of Grace well I then we have to to stay with that to to uh be able to follow it and I just wrote a couple of these off and we don't have them now for the for the viewing there but on uh paragraph 113 is the sign of the time 63 11 13. he said it's three stages of Grace but said really extreme stations right you call it stations there all right in the message called hidden live 55 1006 three steps are dispensations now he's calling it a dispensation and he says we are in the last dispensation all right now and then we've got them naturally on paragraph 78 and paragraph 86 of the future home where he said he believed in the three stages in the talk that from the beginning all right but now when he'll say that you are born again and talking about justification remember that you have to cover that that way because how else could you cover it because if he didn't say it that way it would leave out Wesley Luther and all of them down through there so he has to bring it in the order to try to cover it all right but we believe in this day that we have to have this three stages because that's like the outer Court the inner Court the holy of holies the water the blood the life you know which is the the natural things coming forth and doing that and uh now I stirred some thoughts Sunday afternoon there and I hope to keep stirring them to get you to think amen because I want to tell you the truth you know but you know I tried to express to you uh a little bit about the new birth and and uh you know a lot of people think the new birth is just they'll come to the Altar and and they just pray through right now that's wonderful I believe in that I gave you scripture to show you that the three thousand you know that received the baptism of the Holy Ghost on the debt Pentecost now the 3 000 outside they went through the three stages right there right back but it took the disciples three and a half years to be tutored you know because there was no uh Holy Ghost been given until it was in Jesus Christ all right right but it took them that time and and I told you that I believe that you know and I tell you now listen this is what I'm saying now you say well brother Dave when you say this one now I'm saying what I mean I believe you can come to the Altar and pray right through to the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right all right because it's according to your faith amen according to what you can believe right all right but I believe too that most people will not do it right little takes time it takes that's right the doings but still no matter what now you've got to go through today three stages or steps our dispensations or stations or whatever you want to call it to be warned again amen yeah all right because we're in the climax of it all to tie everything together all right so then you've got to have those three and I believe and did experience my own self so that's the one reason I believe it but I believe it's that each step of the new birth is is a station or a place or a dispensation or a Time and uh you know it's something you're going through all right a birth means coming forth in too right right all right now then in doing that then sometimes it takes time I refer to Brother Gary Atkins and we talked a little bit about it because he was about one year in his experience of of seeking after God and now you've heard me tell this thousands of times that that I was two years when I came into this message I was a uh you know I had received what I thought was salvation when I was it of them when I was about 18 years old and I believe it was a work of God and I believe God cleansed me up and took away a lot of the desires I had and things like that but when I saw what the prophet was saying about the baptism of the Holy Ghost I realized I didn't have it right and for two years now I studied the message and you've heard me even tell I was reading six books a day and listening to two tapes you know in one day and it that was not just one day of doing I would do it all the time brother colic and witness to that because he was sitting right there with me I sat down in an old chair right in his place where he worked and we talked for hours and I'd read for hours you know and do it but I was still seeking God until one day I received an experience that I felt agreed with what the Bible and what the prophet had been trying to describe as the experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen now speaking in tongues is not the baptism is not the baptism of all this right amen we read where the Prophet said a lot of people shouted and I put it back in here tonight A lot of people shouted and didn't get the Holy Ghost a lot of people believed and didn't get to hold up a lot of people spoke in tongues and didn't get it all right so then there's a difference and now here's one I want you to think about you know I gave it to brother Joe and them to pull up and sometimes when I do that you look outside you'll see ones and then on the other side you'll see one a so go ahead and put up 1A this is one thing that comes up when I'm sitting in that study and something clicks and I I said well I better get that one all right so now look what he said on page 148 of the show Martin Church age which is the church age book all right look what he's talking about let's stop up here in the beginning he's talking about how they had to journey and they all came through the same Mammon and eight of the same manner and would start with a spitting Rock and fought her the same Cloud by day and the pillar Fire by night but only two reached the promised land that's right only two were true are real Believers that is correct because the word tells us that the rest died because of unbelief and because of unbelief they could not enter in Hebrews 3 19. then since that is so and only two entered then the rest were not true believers what made the difference what's that who stayed with the word right when the hearts of the ten spies failed at Katie's barnia Joshua and Caleb did not stack did not excuse did not stagger for they believed the word and said we are more than able to take the land they knew they could because God had said it that's it I have give you the land I after all those Israelites what saw the power the goodness the Deliverance of God they did not enter into rest which is the top of the Holy Ghost so you can see right now that very few will ever believe all the way to receiving the spirit of God Amen and very few people will believe all the way to receive in the spirit of God they may be religious they may go to church they may shout speak in tongues all kind of thing claim the message of the hour all kind of things run around and said that they'll they'll they will be in you know claim to to stay with the old message or something you know and try to claim the new birth of the age that we're living in and you look around and when we get down to getting into those doctrines and I said I wouldn't get to it's been kind of slow but you know taking some of the doctrines of the message you'll find out that a lot of those doctrines were old doctrines right way back brother Brown said every Doctrine come out of Genesis right amen then you'll see that a lot of those doctrines will go back to the Mormons go back to the bad disc go back to the methodists the you know the things that that will show you that that message is where it came from right all right we'll see people claiming to be this great Revelation you know that's come forth in the end times since the prophet brought it but he said he taught three processes three stages from the beginning all right justification sanctification amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right man that is what constitutes as we gave them their Sunday the new birth that's right all right and doing that then I want you to follow it or to listen to what I'm saying I believe then that very few people see he said very few people would really want to receive him right I believe very few people can believe under receiving when they come to the altar right the first time yes sir he said well I went down and shut the hand to the preacher I went down that smoking tongue and I cried I shouted oh that's well and good yeah if it was the new birth amen but if not it was a work of the holy spirit because justification isn't working on this right sanctification is a work of the Holy Spirit but the baptism is not right see justification doesn't put the life of God in you sanctification cleanses The Vessel for the life of God to be placed but the baptism has to burn out according to Future home all the things that are left and can place the life of God within you to be the new birth all right now in doing that then I want you to follow with me and think about it that however it is if you go to the Altar and receive it one time wonderful get me right that's right don't go off and say brother Dale ain't saying the truth now you're lying if you do I'm telling you the best I can to give you scripture for it the prophet talks about things some people receive and pray through right at one time right amen but mainly but basically most people don't that's right that's her then they have to go through the stages but if you go through it right there at one time that night you went through the three stages to get there or you didn't get it right right you didn't get the new birth if you didn't go through three stages that's right well all I've done is just come up shouting and screaming well if you didn't and it was because you went through the three stages right but if you only went into stage one you can shout like everything stage two you can really shout all over the place yeah and thank you got it and that's the danger of the point to people is they won't go on and seek God after them right all right here's 18 492 times I said this I'd rather seek God all my life yes sir and get at the end of The Journey he said you've had it all alone amen then to go through all of my journey not seeking God and wind up at the end of it and he said depart from me I never knew you right right yeah I want to go on with God and keep on seeking God and I you know I I like what brother Brown said he says I knew the Rapture was coming tomorrow right and he said I plant potatoes he said I just go plant potatoes that's what he said all right you said well bless God I know people in this message because of 77 now they sold out quit and barred everything they could ready to live and yep 1977 packs they wound up broke right in financial stress and everything else and then they had to live off a lot of other people probably yep but see it's because of what the dog all right he calls you what did this talk yep amen then for him and help but I don't believe we've taught it that way right all right now do you understand what I'm saying now I believe you can go all the way through it one time I believe that because they did in the Bible that's right but I know all the polishes and all of those different things they were in a journey right right amen and even let's see now if I can get this right and if I quote the names wrong places correctly you do it wasn't um two of the disciples was even preaching the gospel to a group and couldn't get the baptism of the Holy Ghost to come on to people that are in the book of Acts and they had to go get somebody one got John or one color or who other Peter or whoever it was to come down and lay hands on them they received the Holy Ghost but see everybody thinks she just you know what do you mean I shouted so I know I got it well all right we're gonna find out after a while what the evidence is amen and see if that evidence will come will you know if if it will do it you know it doesn't matter what we do we shout speak in tongue you could now forgive me for taking it but you could take the life of brother Brown and the ministry he had and bring it down to the bases and put it in an individual and if that individual wasn't born again he still lost right all right amen that's as firm as I believe he said no cause you can't do this you can't do that people have done it right thank you they've done it and wound up still lost right yes you know but brother Dale you don't understand I I know I got the Holy Ghost because I believe the message um brother used to tell me he said I know I'm going to heaven because I love right around the family well that's wonderful but that was the only evidence he had now I'm going to turn down that evidence I never told him he was lost brother left here you know one time because he told me about something I said well if this don't match up he said you told me I was wrong I told him what he was saying didn't match the word right well if he's standing here right now telling the same thing in right because that's you know if our lives don't line up that's it amen see people's done away with fruit so the spirit as being an Evidence now brother Randall said to the Lord corrected him straightened him out and lined up right I agree we'll read them but you showed me where he ever done away with fruits this year sorry no but if you do all the other and then got the fruits and Spirits you're getting lined up good amen that's right but if you just got the fruits of the spirits you're not lined up too good because the condo priest can have it that's right but the condo priest cannot receive the word so we're going to get to that all right but we're going to take it easy get into there if we don't get there I'll get it clear all right do we want to explaining are trying to explain of the fact that in the days of Luther to just believe that was the new birth of his age that's right amen now he was already we would call him a convert he was a what do you call them a a what's the word for it's not monk is it what's the word he was in the monastery he was going to he was studying you know of the cat he was in the Catholic church and he was studying the the message you know of what they thought and and all I've had a great high ranking monk a great high-ranking man right sure huh but one day the Lord spoke to him see it was time right that might have been okay in the days behind but something happened and Martin Luther said the judge shall live by faith and he wrote alone on his Bible from what they said you know and I wrote it on mine because she'll live by faith alone right right all right but see that was the message then it was required right that those who came in contact with Luther to have the new birth of the age was no longer to stay with the catholicisms right that they were dealing with a Salvation the Penance is the the uh you know the the offerings the things and you remember Martin Luther was just about to die from fasting and crawling up on beds and and laying on on needles and all kind of different things and just tormenting itself to try to appease his soul but he couldn't do it so then he wound up with de facto the just your little Buffet amen well now did that stop Martin Luther from living a good and you say it that way he probably afterward fasted more he probably cried out for the sins of the people and himself more after then than he ever had before right but he got the new birth that's right he got the new birth because the birth is the birth of the word amen now that's what I believe so I've taught it to you from the beginning right I believe the new birth is the birth of the word amen I didn't say the new birth is to read the word or didn't say I believe the word it's when the word is revealed to the equipment to you it's made alive to you that's the new birth Jesus sewed the word down for three and a half years into those disciples heart and when the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost it quickened that word that they had held according to the Bible amen they took the word and held it and they equipped it or made it alive that was the New Birth so it'd be the new birth in every age would be the birth of the word right and that's where brother round said people will even deny the birth of the word I put it somewhere in my nose they got sticking somewhere yeah okay listen to what he calls the the birth of the false prophets will bring false birth it's not on the computer now true profits will bring the word right the birth of the word Christ amen all right that's my message called you must be born again 62 12 31 in the morning service all right 62 318 the spoken word is the original seat now for the birth of the word is Christ not a polluted with the denominations the early church no denominations just a word and spirit irrigated brother God laid the word down there like that and the Holy Spirit irrigated and there she went she brought four children amen huh he says on the message the seed is not air with a shot 65 2 18 referring to Mary when the Mary denied you know and said your father and I right all right what did she deny Pentecost took speaking in tongues they denied the birth of the word that's exactly what it did it'll take so much of it but they won't take the rest of it it denied the birth of the word just like Mary did so you can watch there's no more organizations you know all right so then deny the birth of the word you said what brother Dale I I just received no you've got to have somebody there's never been anybody to received a new birth that didn't hear the word show me one time yes sir I challenge that up on the Basin and they were in the Bible or the prophet's message or anywhere he said well I wouldn't I wouldn't hear no preacher I'd read oh you're reading I was listening to tell you oh yes listen take you listen to somebody right amen because the seed has to come through the body right come on was he into that then look what the prophet goes on to say okay brother pull up um number one this is the message how can I overcome 1963 8 25 in the morning service and look what he says this is the age of the life personal life of Christ where the the chemicals of his body chemical out his body what was in him first under justification now remember the other Sunday I showed where the Run said the things that was in the body of Christ of Jesus Christ came out was the ability to bring the New Birth the water the blood the life right right remember that tie it together now huh what was in here first under justification about justification the water baptism second under the new birth of Wesley sanctification with cleansers and thirdly under the baptism when the Holy Ghost putting the vessel in the door so he calls Wesley's message in his birth the sanctification was a birth and like I told you the other day we actually come along believing Martin Luther's message came to America to preach to the heater found out he needed to be converted himself why because God was moving into another realm to bring sanctification all right so then in that age then if you said I believe Luther well how come you don't believe what we actually talk all right yep and we're not talking about the wrong thing talking about the truth right right so is it when Azusa Street came with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and brother Brown calls that a great prophet 464 the seal book right amen a great prophet came you said no that's no no read the book then at the end of the day so messenger would arrive the Holy Ghost is the prophet of God Amen I remember when it was up at Jeffersonville you know years ago started about 68 going there and they'd say who's to take over who's the leaders who's who's the prophet now well Bill Paul got it one day he said I want to read you something I'm going to run and said right here the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the prophet right glad he done that so yeah all right man watch we've been over these but I want to keep reminding you look at number twos questions and answers on the seal 63 324 in the morning service you see each one of those ages only taking the dip into the Holy Spirit justification of the work of the Holy Spirit sanctification is the work of the Holy Spirit but the baptism is the holy spirit look at it that's the reason it took a prophetic Prophet to come down that's the reason why they say about it no matching girl to the age who was that in Sister Street because the Holy Ghost came himself in his fullness of the baptism then at the end of the age is when the prophet came on the scene amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost that came forth on the day of zeuser street was the baptism of the Holy Ghost just exactly like the 3 000 in the book of Acts amen not like the 120 in the upper room I've explained that they were two or three and a half years the other only heard one message and receive the new birth all right that's your word we putting it all in you look at the next one the third seal which in 1963 320th but then if the Pentecostal message was the last message which just to became the same question the baptism of the Holy Ghost the live stream messages the last three Church ages forms the complete birth right then he goes on to explain read it off there while I'm talking he's explaining that what comes from Jesus's body right is the very substance that brings us to a new birth water bud Spirit life right right all right so now where is it going to see then we firmly believe in each age having the baptism of the Holy Ghost all down truth all seven Church ages and each one of those were born into the kingdom of God all right and then it's to return and it was to return back in the day of Azusa Street and I'm running a long line across all right but to come to where did it requires three stages or three steps of Grace to be in the body see it's returned back like it was in the book of Acts all right Azusa Street brought it back like it was in the book of Acts you said well brother death I don't like that because the Central Street was yeah they were trinitarian that's exactly right right most people don't even know that the one this doctor never started about 1912 or 14 somewhere in there they were trinitarian but that don't make no difference God winked in her ignorance and he calls it the prophet right you know what he said there was no information here to the age then he'll tell you that there was a one-eyed black man was the messenger of that age amen yeah but it's reasons for those things we've been over that and all we're doing all right the New Birth has always been the birth of the word amen now we we get into today when you got artificial inseminations or what you call that you know whatever artificial pragnation but that don't have nothing to do with the word of God right ever birth is the same it doesn't matter if they take it out of this woman take it off that or that man and put it in another woman and she gives birth that don't make no difference it's all still the same he took the life from the man the the egg from the woman and it produces a birth but no matter what they do or whatever you say about it it comes out to be the same every birth is the same amen brother man said where they said a pink dark desperated hospital or you know or where else right it's all the same the same thing happens what water comes forth blood comes forth right and then the baby comes forward amen and just because the baby comes doesn't mean it's alive it's got to have the birth of life or the Breath of Life breathe into its nostrils to become a living Soul right that's what the new birth is the birth of the word where God has breathed into our nostrils I read it to you there where he said it that they they irrigate they lay that word down and God come over there again because that's what it takes to make a bird all right and that would bring forth a complete birth in this day now we go to where brother Brown was talking about what the birth of the word Jesus showed the word the seed for the new birth to come you know brother run said John priest justification Jesus preached Saints vacation all right sure we've been preaching this for 40 years we already know a lot of the glory amen that's right a lot of you heard it for 40 years you ought to know what I'm fixing to say next you said well no don't you sanctification is the sowing of the seed amen that's right man yep he said that's when you're begotten right but then the word was quickened right all right you're coming by The Prophet's message look what he would say then well it was number four you know these but we're just putting them in here a lot of people don't know them from the message Christ The Mystery of God revealed 63 728 look what he said what is the new birth then because you read the other Christ's life in you look Christ in you makes him the center of the life of the Revelation see Christ's life in you makes him the center of the Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible a complete revelation of Christ Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what God is trying to do what is the new birth then you'd say well brought around what is the new birth it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you that's right amen see not you join the church you shook a hand you've done something different you said a Creed you promised to live by a code of rules but Christ the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place listen it's Christ Pastor priests whatever it might be it's Christ in you it's the Revelation that the church was built upon amen that means you you've got a problem and you do something about it right amen right and then you won't wind up at the end of the road saying I've all of my life I've kept this as my evidence and now find out it's not true you remember the woman that rode around and was talking about how she taught Sunday school she's done all kind of things right said but she come to her dying bed she was dying he said her real Soul come up before her right and she said I'm lost yep oh the preacher said you lied to me I'm lost I said get her another hypo in other words shut her up all right because the preacher didn't know how to prayer through right so he surely didn't want to pray for her no more I'm just honest going on see then what is it what is the New Birth the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you amen amen huh now has he ever revealed himself to you amen that's right or are you just taking what somebody else said that's right that's it right you taking what you've been called yep my brother Dale and I realized that just I sit back I think he want to go you know I was really kind of talking to the devil that you know for over a hundred years who called it producer Street 100 years right right and you know the devil has planted a seed into people's minds it's hard to get that destroyed right man sir because that seed was planted of speaking in tongues shouting crime doing this that or the other until people are dependent upon that and will not depend upon What God Says that's right right so then if for one time tonight after a hundred years I don't mean you've been listening to it but I mean for a hundred years you you and I have faced those things that were brought from a hundred years ago because every one of us in our mind and one way or the other has always wondered what the evidence of the Holy Ghost is right right come on you didn't wonder about it right ma'am I don't want to do you I shouted well Gloria Hallelujah I hope you're right I said all I can say right so if you get a mad at me now forgive me not for telling you the truth but forgive me for making you mad at me mad enough you'll get down to study it a little bit you'll dig in and find out whether I'm right or wrong but my daddy says and my mom was this and my uncle's daddy ain't got nothing to do with you right you ain't going to heaven on Daddy's religion or Mama's religion or Uncle's religion or Grandma's religion that's right well you're throwing off on my kin folks no I'm not you are right because you're finally admitting it I mean I love my mother and all heavens done everything I could for her while she was alive but I know my mama could be lost too and that's what a lot of people don't want to realize if my mother wasn't born again she was lost if my daddy wasn't born again she would he was lost I know my mom was that well okay why what's your reason for it come on I don't mean what's your reason for thanking your kin folks are saved yeah yeah I like what the old man used to say when you said old tiny folks said you've got to be born all right I'm sorry with face life amen bro face reality I don't know where brother random was saved or not yeah well I went in him right I only know about myself amen all right folks so you didn't come through like I did when I was sitting there praying and studying and saying Lord with the book in my hand saying this man says they'll be false prophets what if he's one come on brother right that's what I asked the Lord oh bless God I would never do nothing like that brother Dave okay all right you're not gonna eat it forgive me but you know what I got my answer right and that was in the day that I wasn't born again I would ask him I would write the Bible in the books down and say Lord what is this man is a false prophet because he said and you said in your word you see the very left if it was possible and I said I gotta quote your word that he says that matter of fact did get the ride so confusing how to cut to work short I can quote yeah my brother Ryan said that one day you know what do you say how many of you know what I'm fixing to say you heard it thousands of times all he would ever answer me and say what does the word say that's right that's the only answer I'd ever get but you know what that was the right answer right that was the greatest answer I could have ever gotten right he could have come down personally and appeared to me and talk to me and told me all these all these he'd say what does the word say all right man okay I'll go back and read some more then I'll ask you a question again and I got the same answer yep but you see I believe in the birth of the word amen I believe all babies are born because of all babies being birthed exactly a lot you know what amen you know babies born you gotta have a mama you gotta have a daddy but one way or the other where it be what do you call it what's your word building by proxy whatever you want to do it all by you know don't make no difference you still got one but you see what I'm talking about what is the new birth the birth of the word the birth of the word the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you amen now it's not I won't call her name but she came to the house one time and said I'm going to get baptized because my husband wants me to be I said I won't baptize you know you can forget it so we talked on for a little while and she said that again and I said look I ain't lost you know and all of this stuff I kind of got a little bit of thought coming to me I said you know it's the truth she said yes I said okay we'll do it now we'll go do it now I wouldn't have baptized her it wouldn't make no difference yeah whatever I want to honor I hope you're good that's an honor but you know this is not followed Mom and Daddy now come on folks this is not following Brother Dale right amen if you follow me brother Dale it's like a brother come here years ago said I come to the California to come out here to the Lula thing I said first off that's where you goofed up yep as far as I was concerned he would have stayed in California right a man because he goofed up by thinking there was some Lula thing right right but that's that's all right I don't think there's no rule of that right uh if if this ain't it I want to keep this until that time all right you find it you find that we'll go with that but I'm going to keep this until that comes okay because I I've had a good time you know in all my life and it's always compared and my New Birth has always brought me to that place why now watch what the prophet goes on to say number five that was Vision 1960 1204 in the evening service you've heard this one a long time right now ask God to what we're talking on Revelation ask him to give you a revelation of this for it can only be known by Revelation and you can only be saved by Revelation right yep okay you can only be saved by Revelation you have a knowledge of it intellectually but you can't be saved until it's revealed to you no man can call Jesus the Christ only mother Holy Ghost that's what the Bible says no man can say Jesus is a Christ until he has received the Holy Ghost he might say the pastor says so the Bible says so them are truths the church says no that is true but you don't know yourself until the Holy Ghost has revealed it to you and he's become in you no matter and no man can call Jesus a Christ only by the Holy Ghost not by knowledge not by intellectual amen that's right so it's only can be a personal revelation to you it's not brother Branham brought the message I thank God for the message right but it's the Holy Ghost Amen Brother Richard Wilson said the Bible says what the spirit has to say that's it but the spirit has to say am I think I like that that's right amen the Holy Spirit Well now Brother David A lot of people went off and said the Holy Spirit yep my people would anoint me with the Holy Ghost and when I've done a lot of things too right you come up line like crazy see him God told him there's three Lords two Lords and and two souls and all kind of doctrines oh yeah I don't make no difference that's right I like what Jesus said one day we never said what's after they followed on me right right amen I like that point I ain't trying to get you from me I like what he said all right let's follow him right amen you said you falling right around I believe what Paul Paul said follow me as I follow Christ right you know what I've never found Paul off of fall in Christ and you know after 40 something years of studying this message I've never found brother around him off of following Crouch have you right I'll be glad to listen to you if you have oh he said this and he said that yeah what have you said but now listen you can only be saved by Revelation right and it's a revelation of God's word that's right and the prophet we gave you the quote there a minute ago were true prophets will bring true births why because they'll bring you the word the false prophets will bring false birth that's right that's right you ever seen a false birth in the cow only man it really knows what he's talking about can tell you where's Foster true because that old cow she'll start getting fat and she'll start just being mud fat and she'll look like she's as pregnant as everything in the world could be and the man that really knows and walk up and punches aside he said I need number to falzburg and you know what'll happen one day you'll go and out it goes and you ain't got nothing but a skinny old cow because they can push the side to see where the cash is false birth look around the world today and tell me there's not a world full of fox Birds now we're not talking about natural right we're talking about spiritual amen it don't matter where you hun do Muslim whatever it is it's all Salzburg right but it all comes from the same core all right but get on with it each age received the word of the age the Holy Spirit made that Word Alive gave them without AIDS the new birth now let's go to another point then on it for just for tonight what is the evidence of the new birth now if it's right that you've got water blood and life and remember that the baby's not alive in the mother's womb right I'm glad the prophet brought that right no yes it is it's wiggling and twitching yeah they use the souls every animal is in this moment right same thing just twitching and moving right every animal ever burp there's that baby inside of there is twitching and moving that's right you said what they can show you where they're sucking their thumbs and crying and yep and kill the dog right you see what you ain't never seen where they're trying to kill them you know and cause them to lose the baby yeah and then do the same thing with the dog cat whatever because it's not alive right it's alive in the point that it's moving and and blood and Etc disconnected from the mama or the from the the uh umbilical cord and dated right but see water blood baby and in life something to the baby he starts the baby's born doesn't mean that it's alive amen stillborn babies are born every day right so you got a spank you to do something you gotta have something got to happen to it all right but now get the difference in what I'm talking about when we talk about Dan wants to find some way some something something they've done as an Evidence right that's the spanking of the baby see why not get the baby here and a life will prove whether or not it's a baby right amen the life will prove it it'll make many sense that's right because it's it's got a birth all right but now we talk about then fruits of the spirit all right you people say well I I believe I'm saved because I got love joy but he stood this in my heart that's good but your condo appreciate those things too that's right now I believe just like I said while ago I believe in one God always have had I check a doctorate how do you check a doctor brother they'll buy my new birth that's right my new birth is based upon one God right you can't be based upon a trinity because you wouldn't know which one saved you what do you mean I say mother and I said ah come on it's all based upon one God right manifestation of the same God father son Holy Ghost makes one God justification sanitation the baptism of the Holy Ghost makes a new birth water blood and spirit brings the baby a life in the thing out of court intercourse always keep those trees running right big man sit on him throwing that big money sit on my porch one time he said life comes the fourth stage I said life comes the third stage my brother I said I don't know what you're talking about you're reading the prophet's message and got into adoption but you got to have the last year to get something to where you can adopt it right right no right well you better get ready because I'm going in the house running up with this dying life because this guy would he weighed 475 pounds most of you know we huh and hit it you know he was driving this point I said I'm going in the house and get my books you better get what you're talking about we're gonna talk with the Bible this Prophet said that when I came back out and laid it all down forget it the only thing you wouldn't convert me right because it's water blood and spirit adoption goes into water blood spirit and the word carrying you up a statue man that's adoption right four stages but it's only three stages to the birth right we've done read it never want to go the third three men she gives a nice 380 is complete suburbate all right so you can do all of these things that we talk about and still not be born again that's right amen I gave them to you there the other day and look what let's see be number six for the coach Anderson we went through this and go through it through each age God says allotted so much work and the church that gets it all confused now then he sends a prophet among them vindicates the word it's just not any other time we speak today and see that we speak today and say the Methodist Luther says you believe that's all you have to do you're justified by faith blue I mean he said they believed and didn't have it huh and it's your profit we know that a long game we actually ruled what called second work of Grace sanctification all that shouts in there Sanctified has got it many shouted and didn't have it long come to come to Pentecost said all that speaks with tongues has got it many spoke with tongues and didn't have it Along come Christian Science and says it's love the fruit of the spirit many of them showed fruits of the spirit and don't have it now you know what it connects that to when he gets to that point he said what about the condo priest who dedicated your babies who loaned you money when you needed all this and took care of you and said and said all Jesus ever done he just took and planted a rope and run them out of Temple all right you know what he's getting to right but look number seven what shall we do with Jesus called Christ 64 126. the evidence that I said the other day we try to place evidence Luther said believe and walk out the devil believes to Wesley's good shout you got it but found out he didn't I didn't mean to Western Avenue work you know what he's saying come on and it all said speak in tongues and you got it they didn't Christian Science says love you got the fruit of the spirit but they haven't they denied the divinity of Jesus Christ what is the evidence of it when that Spirit that's in you can punctuate every promise with an amen now that does away with all the shout and all of this and all of this out of the other all that's well and good we believe in every bit of it because that's just your nature and brother brownie even made a statement this way one time he said where you're born again at does has a lot to do with you even after you're born again he said if you're born again in an emotional Church you'll be emotional he says you're born again and kind of a formal type of church he said you'll be that way all right if you want that quarter be glad to find that look what is the evidence of it when that Spirit that's in you can punctuate every promise with an amen and God will confirm it see so you've got God confirming it right you believe in it right that's exactly the way it was with Jesus Christ now look what he said you read it so when Jesus Christ what was it the spirit of in him would punctuate every word and then God confirmed it all right yes they had they had more fruits of the spirit they had all kinds of evidences you could pin any evidence down to anything you can't still repent any evidence down to anything but God himself manifesting his word that's the only true evidence that there is that you or you're a Christian how can you be a Christian when I go and let me ask you to say some more quotes that are laid there if you want them but everyone said how can God deny his word right yeah he said can God deny his own word he said well then how can the spirit of God be in you and deny his word amen he's playing around with it right okay go ahead to the next Jesus came and called 64-13 who has the fruit of spirit there and he's talking about you know not the fruit of the spirit not speaking in tongues and shouting you said then brother Branham what is the evidence what is the evidence the vindication of the word in the hour the Vindication of the word in the hour read all in between there and come down look Luther had the evidence of his age Wesley of his age Pentecost of his age but we're in another age those things are good but like the baby has got a finger and I knows but after a while he has to become a human being he has to become a a mature child to then be born have a soul body Spirit move around turn it all together with where we're at all right look at the next one what is the evidence message and when their their eyes were opened they knew him 1964 4 16. but what is the evidence of a believer that will but believe the identified word of the hour it's always been that way people get it scrupled up in all kind of traditions and religion and the nominations and education and so forth but God comes along with his word and concerns it confirms it for the hour that's the evidence that's right let me put it this way to believe brother Brown's message is wonderful but do you believe Luther's message right Buffet do you believe Wesley's message now we're not talking about the fanaticism that went with it and all the false doctrines and the trinitarianisms and the garbage right come on Amen Luther taught a message to the judge you'll live by faith and that's Bible right that was the only way in the body and you come along today and say I don't believe what Luther taught what Wesley taught okay but I got the new birth I believe the message of the age I can prove it to you I can prove to you you're anointed ones what's your life you sure won't like that but that's his truth as I can be I mean only anointed Ones Will Follow that line of thought right anointed ones will deny other ages as to having the new birth I'm trying to base everything up on them having the new birth okay now look what he says what is the evidence of a believer we covered that look what he says now broken system 1964 726 the evening service the day I was talking with a good friend Dr Lee Vale who is present now he's quite a theologian and so we usually have some have some pretty good discussions on the scripture very smart he asked me one time what I thought about the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost was it speaking in tongues it's been many years ago I said no can't see that he said neither do I said though I've been taught that he said what would you think would be an Evidence I said the most perfect evidence I can think of is love so we got to talking on that and I thought that sounded pretty good so I just held that and all that if a man has got love but one day the Lord in a vision straightened me out now this is your Prophet okay he said that the evidence of the spirit was those who could receive the word leader love not speaking in tongues but it's receiving the word so that's the Holy Ghost giving you a clear understanding of the word right okay and he goes down the Holy Ghost is upon you you shall reveal these things that I've taught you and show you things to come so there is a genuine evidence of the Holy Ghost he has never told me anything wrong yet that it's the evidence of the Holy Ghost it's he who can believe the word you can receive it because Jesus never said when the Holy Ghost has come you'll speak with tongues now show me in the bible really he never said the Holy Ghost come you'd do any of those things but he said he will take these things of mine and show them to you and will show you things that is to come so there is the genuine evidence of the Holy Ghost According To Jesus himself all right According To Jesus himself all right I wonder where does that put us questions and answers 1964 823 the evening service what is the evidence that a person is really Fielding the Holy Ghost now that would have been questions and answers let's see broken sinistering would have been 728 this is 8 23. so this is the same year a little later on what is the evidence that a person is really feeling the Holy Ghost John 14 26. he said when the Holy Ghost has come see he will show you things to come see he'll be a he'll perfect it perfect it man mage won't do it and he is the word and when the Holy Ghost has come he will identify himself in you with the scripture and that is the true sign that the holy spirit is in you because it is the word now look what if you spoke with tongues I just want to ask that Jesus said when the Holy Ghost come what he would do but what if you spoke with him jumped up and down shouted and everything else and then come to the word and tell you the baptism of prove to you by the scripture as I have that the baptism using the title of Father Son and Holy Ghost is absolutely a misunderstanding in the scripture nobody was ever baptized like that and you go ahead and hang with it anyhow could you tell me the holy spirit in you would do a thing like that how can it deny its own word right amen simple language right how can it deny its own word let's see one more well let's leave that off come on no further we just stopped right there on the evidence that's why whether or not the spirit in you agrees wouldn't work now what if it agrees so long to quit now that's not what he's talking about right whether or not it keeps on agreeing with the words now Jesus agreed with every word so now if I throw down your Doctrine or thought tonight or what you believe the new birth is then you need to do something about it right and get mad at me won't hit it that's right but you know that's what it is ain't nobody gets mad at Jesus for saying it you know do you ever notice that yeah you notice that people you can read what brother Brown says to them and they won't get mad at him they get mad at you for reading it you're a smart addict you found it found it I found what he said why don't you get mad at him why don't you get upset with him why aren't you upset with God 's what it said it I've always said it this way and I don't mind saying it if there is a God that's not a question on my hand I have no problem with it but if there is a God and he can't keep his word straight then what are we going to look for or what are we going to talk about right but if you can keep his work straight and it's been straight all the way through and the birth has always been the same no matter what age it was in the New Birth was the same it was the birth of the word of that age and so is it today you can't depend upon just I repented of my sins nope that's right that's wonderful I got Sanctified I quit all these things and all that that's wonderful amen but we got to have the baptism in the Holy Ghost if we don't have the bad kids when the Holy Ghost we're still in a lost condition right right when I went as well as you said you gave a Sunday word you told me yeah I should try to run around and said you have eternal life it just believes it the team you put together all the other things and where he said where he said even in sanctification you're just begotten you're not even converted yet that was the next quote that was fixing to come up he said you're not even converted yet he told Peter he said Thou Art converted strengthen the brethren if it was only the shouting to scream into crying the believing and why did Jesus have to die because the disciples had all of it yeah but that's where you wouldn't like the point that there was Judas is caring and you know the Judas is carried according to the church age book and according to the prophet giving you the scripture there his name was written in heaven that's right because your name is written when you're a believer come on I can show you that because you know it Judas was right there with him until the Holy Ghost entered into him right and then he went out and done what he done do you know what I like about him you know what I like about Judas he found out what he'd done he found out he had denied the Lord Jesus he had enough gumption to go hang yourself and yet we sat down in church and holy Glory Hallelujah I believe the prophet's message shoutings and everything else is all it is you brother there you just don't believe it because you're an old die-high Baptist you know you better understand what random come from hmm I've been to foot washes communion in the Baptist Church how many of you ever went through Marty really didn't went one time and they had a communion then I had the foot wash I didn't know no water in the paint I had a towel I'm not going off on that jerk come on nice people actually in my beds that's just like me and you but what I'm saying is you see how far we drift away from the word when you do that and after like I said 100 100 years I said I think I said Satan for 100 years over you've been teaching people about these evidences and signs and shoutings and crimes and and believings and all that God has been trying to get us to get to the birth of the word brother Dale I just don't have a new birth to say that it was on a certain day well I believe that if you'll ask God he'll speak to you about it and give it to you and you'll know it and I was asked Sandy how do you know brother Dale what you've got was the new bird well you know the best thing I can say to you because I shouted I've cried ain't no spoken to others but you know what I've always believed if there is a God that he'd be able to keep his words straight enough the word is I believed it he would come to that word in honor it all right I never saw a great light flashing great things happening when I received a new birth my wife and I received at the same time I was crying yes I've done that before I saw a guy when I was 11 years old in a church I never counted out of salvation I saw a lot of things when I was in the Baptist Church you know we believe in praying for the sick stuff back then I tried to live a good life I told you about nobody could stand there looking at the women come out of the off of a bus that's coming to sing for us one night and that's your old man there was 65 or another he wasn't old man he was 65. and then they're just looking at him I just looked him straight and now I said that ain't right you're not supposed to look like that this is my brother-in-law's Daddy I said you're not supposed to look like that he said the Bible said look on God's Heritage I said it's don't say lust I strip I didn't play back there I set my Deacon board and told him I said brother there's something wrong around here I said there's more money to do I take it up and count it do I know what's coming in there's more money do tied out of this Beacon board then the ribs coming in that offering plate upstairs because I believe what God Said he said traffic I believed I still believe his word amen I Feast on his word I've been in a Revival then ever since I come in this message but did you see something's like no no it was a knowledge I know that ain't gonna go over what most people because they got out more than that you know what brother Brown said God knows what you need and you mind if I quote him something he said he knows what you need and he said if you want to speak in tongues you just laid there long enough and he'll let you stick in time because he's a good God now he went against Crime and shouting and doing things you see all at once the word that I had studied so long just began to unveil come on amen and I've seen Christ right amen writing his word right I've seen it then for myself amen before then I was taking what brother Brown had to say about it that's right sure when that happened Hallelujah I had something on my own amen well you think everybody know known because according to your emotional system I've explained that a while ago it's according to your emotional system like I said you want these quotes call me whatever runaround said God's a good God he said he knows you won't speak in tongues he said you just laid out long enough in the election that's right hey but all of that doing we read it I don't have to be the only the holy but the Holy Ghost can't deny his word now let me put one more with it I didn't bring the quote run around and see it the way you know whether a preacher is relying on is whether he's staying with the word continually staying with the word he said then you just checked out what he's saying I'm just paraphrasing it but just you just check what he's saying to see if it's right because he can't tell you something wrong I'm sorry not the word so you check the preacher by the word amen that's what I was asking God this man says prophets will come what if each one of them because you know I go down the street or I learn somebody say prophets will come they're false and I know that was you know and he's off the word not only the Holy Ghost should put the word together amen that's what I love about you only the Holy Ghost can put the word together you know what I've been called an intellectual Baptist because of that so you wouldn't know what that meant if you haven't been there and studied but it just simply meant that I had taken the letter of the word and figured it out Miranda said you better leave them Baptists alone he said they'll tie you up in that scripture now as you see they take it and read it right out of the word to you and you can fall over and shout and glory to Hallelujah all you want to it ain't going to change them we'll just stay right there with the word it is also written right that's it what is the evidence of the baptism and all the others whether or not the spirit of God in you agrees with the word and if the spirit of God is in you he will always agree with the word he will never deny his word that's why I wrote around said if you could find it in this Bible go before God and said if he won't fulfill it you can call him alive Now That's How Strong he believed in the world Amen Jesus sowed it took him three and a half years to show down enough scripture into those people for them to get around again Mustang to be able to to get the people to a place where we got 119 a Red Bull 119 in the regular you might have a knee the only thing I say to you is one thing if you do or not you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost never stop seeking that's right that's right it ain't important who's the presidential election the other day and brought around him away he started out talking we was on a tape the way he started out talking just like he was going to name it he said who's going to be the president you know what he said he said even if I could tell you he said the whole religion the whole world would flock at the door and all the newspapers would print William brownham said so and so is going to be president Eternal gods they're still a prophet that could have told him he could have told him it was going to be that God would have either yep but he could stand there and preach the word and it wouldn't be be put in a newspaper that so many people got saved so many people got healed the dead was raised never was put in a newspaper but he said if you could tell who was going to be president he said your name would be in the paper and be printed all over what about it I told him one time in a Minister's meeting I said you want to know who's going to be president I'm going to tell you or something like that I want to do it where was we had fellowship meeting again yeah and boy everybody got to look I said you want me to tell you I can tell you who's going to be the president everybody got real quiet and everything I said because the Bible says I put in Kings and I take out Kings amen the one God wants in there is going to be the one they all seen what I'm talking about he's the one that knows 11 19 anybody having to eat Blessed assurance salvation amazing myself When you pray no I heard about it the next day it worked did you just come over and I said damn God will come back up thank you great but what if it don't happen I don't live numbers foreign back the other day everybody stand in his place all right father in the name of the name in order to have more shine I agree with you got to move our machine and deliver it all over it I agree with you foreign what's wrong you know what I like is the story that was told that time about the seller you know that another woman wanted to bicycle for Christmas remember the story he wanted to bicycle and he kept asking this Dad in them you give me a bicycle told his little boys John I don't know whether I'm gonna be able to party or not you told me when your mouth should you allow me about you that's right John she called it already got everything that we have need of we just need to thank him amen you can't demand him you know the man I told you this mother said I'm I'm working on commanding the Lord thought I mean I'm a boy I just went the other way and I never called a black guy anymore because I was talking to the devil I didn't care nothing in the back online Jimmy it's not commanding God when you're at when you're acting great now say now I believe it was way the other day for these preachers said yes said it he said if God tailed you asked God for something he says no he said that's the greatest answer you could never get that's right he said no no no no I want it he says no because you see he knows what you do or what you're asking that's right those people asked brother ran them said where's an oil well he said he picked up that they were gonna they told him oh we'll do this and we'll give them money we'll do that but he realized they wouldn't do it right he wouldn't tell him he said they went out and they dug weld around got a little bit of butter flutter you know somebody come in it didn't he said I knew it was a little more somebody come in that had nothing to do with the church or anything sit down and hit the gusher he said because they had the wrong attitude that's right I told you one was over in the Philippines Brothers came to me one night and I was already a schedule they had me scheduled to preach but Ernie went one way and I went the other way was trying to cover a lot of churches we did the brother Ernie and brother Vernon came so we want to talk to you said you're scheduled to preach on Friday night okay yeah but we're in the world that wasn't sure who he was like let us know okay that's all right we said we'll tell you one thing he said won't try to get people they want to try to he wants to try to get people together and take up a lot of money because he knew see we wouldn't take it you know they want to get a lot of money because he wants to buy a bunch of goats because there's a lot of money that the Germans left here in the Philippines tons and tons of gold that they've captured he said he wanted to get some goats to sacrifice to the Gods to try to find in favor to find that gold this ain't going you know how you doing brother thank you for telling me they said well we knew you wouldn't but we had to tell you it's not going won't be no part of that right yeah it wouldn't matter if it had been a shitload of gold out there that wouldn't matter to me I ain't going um you see you don't use God's gifts in the wrong way all right that's right I tried my best to explain to ministers the same gift that I have to preach the gospel like itself fried ice cream to an Eskimo sure I know what a gift is you ever deal with me about buying something you'll find out but I'll tell you my price and I'll never change but I didn't give it to you before I change my pride because I ain't going to use my gift I'm not for doing something for the world that's right my gift is to preach to gospel that's right and sometimes I'm so embarrassed in my own staff my sincerity not enough I need more sincerity I need more you know humbleness before the Lord I know that I know how gracious she is right because he's never failed me yet and it wouldn't matter to me to preach to 10 or to 10 million right it's just the same thing yep thank God for the truth that's right amen father we just commit everything into your hands or what we've tried to say tonight we've

Believe In You Lord bringing your own life and letting it come and live and try to get you never one of us we know that our lives are not worthy of anything and forgive us Lord of all of the uncleanness and things that's within us sanctifies set us aside for you Lord help us to be what you want us to be we love you we thank you in Jesus name you're dismissed remember the Bible study
