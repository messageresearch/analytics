[0:00] then you can write coming in if you want
[0:03] to you feel any way you want to but this
[0:05] is a seven-year covenant this is
[0:07] according to Daniel 920 what seven let's
[0:12] go back to Daniel let's make sure I
[0:15] really want to do this today but I felt
[0:17] led to do it so you're going to just
[0:18] barely I'm going to do in a few weeks
[0:21] but I thought what's good today all
[0:28] right verse 27 and he shall confirm the
[0:30] covenant for one week neither did we
[0:32] tell you that he was Antichrist little
[0:37] age he shall make a covenant confirm the
[0:40] covenant with many for one week this is
[0:42] the Covenant made by the Antichrist all
[0:46] right and the whole week has to be
[0:49] covered in the seventy weeks of Daniel
[0:51] because that's what the explanation is
[0:54] right know therefore and understand from
[0:59] the going forth of the commandment to
[1:00] restore and build Jerusalem is 62 week
[1:02] or seven weeks sixty-two weeks which
[1:05] makes how much 69 not 65 67 68 and 69 69
[1:11] weeks are over according to the Bible in
[1:15] the province message 69 weeks of Daniel
[1:18] has already been fulfilled there's one
[1:21] week left after the rapture of the
[1:23] church that's the week that we're going
[1:25] to deal with now alright so that's why
[1:28] you got rapture of the church right here
[1:30] and to begin because we're flowing in
[1:33] this direction alright you're going to
[1:35] be we're going to be flowing in this
[1:36] direction if I got that we're going to
[1:40] be going from the rapture of the church
[1:44] because there's how many weeks and down
[1:47] Sam you wait I'm how many years 49 he's
[1:52] only having been taking right now 483
[1:56] 483 plus seven equals what or 94 that
[2:03] one week left to finish now listen I
[2:06] keep telling to finish the redemption of
[2:08] Israel
[2:08] and the gem the temple I redemptions
[2:14] over when we go into rapture so there's
[2:16] no more Gentiles this is not a Gentile
[2:18] week really has nothing to do with the
[2:21] Gentiles but the Gentiles are interlaced
[2:23] in this because the church nominal
[2:26] church foolish virgins ones without the
[2:29] Holy Ghost are going to go through this
[2:31] time of trouble that we're going to talk
[2:33] about a little bit okay daddy and in the
[2:39] middle of this week and he showed the
[2:43] confirm the coat with me for one week
[2:46] and week and in the midst of the week
[2:50] what's the middle of seven and a half
[2:53] and in the midst of the week he shall
[2:55] cause the sacrifice and ablation the
[2:57] season for the overspreading of
[2:58] abominations he shall make it desolate
[2:59] even into the consummation right here
[3:03] put Battle of Armageddon you can ride
[3:13] anywhere you want to well you can well
[3:22] hey there's two something's in there to
[3:28] these two DS there's two days a RM e ra
[3:36] hey g.e.d do am jealous that's it ally
[3:44] in him do like me but battle of
[3:47] Armageddon
[3:51] you do not know what that was why do I
[3:55] need ride all around let's tell I can
[3:58] shorthand shorthand well battle of Anna
[4:01] then that'll fit bad Armageddon so
[4:04] cut Battle of Armageddon right down
[4:06] that's won the battle Armageddon will
[4:09] happen alright everybody got that now
[4:15] remember your chart here you got to keep
[4:20] it because this is the same chart is
[4:21] that one Gentile rapture one week equal
[4:25] seven year then we're going to start
[4:28] adding into this stuff here because the
[4:30] six-fold purpose has to do what finish
[4:34] everything his ruse redemption has to be
[4:37] in this seven year period and the
[4:40] rebuilding of the temple and the writing
[4:44] end of the millennium all those things
[4:45] have to happen inside this week that's
[4:47] why I said there's no way that according
[4:49] to what people preaching the message in
[4:51] brother Ram did not preach this that
[4:52] there's only that much left tough of
[4:54] earthly time to fulfill the 70th week
[4:57] now remember time goes all the way to
[5:00] the end of the millennium took the
[5:04] Raptor took place today there'd be a
[5:06] thousand and seven years left but only
[5:10] seven years to fulfil nineteen seventy
[5:13] weeks of Daniel seventy weeks there is a
[5:15] time that it ends but it doesn't really
[5:17] end it blends that's right it blends in
[5:22] sure it has what has to happen if
[5:24] remember I told you about the temple
[5:26] they built the temple they said we built
[5:28] a temple 46 years recorded it took 46
[5:32] years but it took 49 physical years
[5:35] perhaps that what I'm saying we gonna
[5:38] move this before let me go over it again
[5:39] what happened is like me and dad we
[5:42] built my house in a year a physical year
[5:45] but it took a year in three months cuz
[5:48] we took some time off go hunting with
[5:49] took some time off go do this you know
[5:51] according to mama we took a lot of time
[5:53] off but we took time off and done this
[5:55] and that the other but we built in any
[5:57] year I tell maybe we took a year off
[5:59] working building
[6:00] they took more than a physical year but
[6:02] it only took us 365 days and buildings
[6:05] when you understand what they were doing
[6:06] because the scripture says they said it
[6:09] was 46 years building this temple well
[6:11] according to the Bible is 49 years he
[6:13] took them to build the temple took 49
[6:15] physical years okay but it only took
[6:19] them 46 probably they would write down a
[6:21] recorded year when they stopped because
[6:24] remember that stopped many times we
[6:25] showed that in ezra and nehemiah they'd
[6:28] stop they just quit building then they
[6:32] start back again we're recording 46
[6:34] years recorded 49 years physical years
[6:37] because remember Daniel 70 weeks there's
[6:39] only one gal medina 70 weeks and that's
[6:41] the what the grafting in and the Bible
[6:45] says that so we're going by the Bible
[6:47] the Bible says that we were in grafted
[6:49] into this olive tree were the wild olive
[6:52] branch God's going to take that wild
[6:55] olive branch which is his pride take us
[6:59] home and then start dealing with the
[7:01] Jews again to finish the 70 weeks of
[7:04] them they'll break up there you should
[7:06] this is this should be something that
[7:07] that when somebody says something man
[7:09] your mind just go clue I know what that
[7:12] means but it's going to take all this
[7:15] dick fuld purpose that's why there's no
[7:19] way that you can jam all this over here
[7:21] and only have three and a half years
[7:22] left because Jesus did not bring in
[7:24] everlasting righteousness setups vision
[7:26] property in normal told that's to happen
[7:30] now you know in the end time all right
[7:33] temple bill y'all done got way ahead
[7:38] stop we're talking about the rapture the
[7:41] Gentile go some of y'all's preconceived
[7:45] ideas has already been destroyed some of
[7:48] your shaking your head yeah so we're
[7:50] going to destroy a few more probably do
[7:52] we get over to here we're at the rapture
[7:54] of the church then we're going to do
[7:56] this right here but there's a lot that
[7:58] goes on in here a lot that goes on
[8:02] inside that's seven year period that's
[8:04] when I say again one more time brother
[8:08] round and ever preached this is going
[8:10] through
[8:10] and a half years of time time you hear
[8:13] me to fulfill the seven two weeks down
[8:15] there's only three and a half years of
[8:17] Jesus's ministry to be fulfilled
[8:20] absolutely no doubt most people even
[8:25] delighted to nomination Alicia preachers
[8:28] before the preachers in the message get
[8:29] that denominational dock in front is
[8:32] that he preached three and a half years
[8:33] here so there's only three and a half
[8:35] years left here we proved by all these
[8:39] dates by the Prophet by the days and by
[8:44] the Bible that sure he preached ran out
[8:47] of years but they cut him off they cut
[8:51] him off and after threescore and two
[8:54] weeks shall Messiah be cut off he
[8:56] doesn't say after threescore in one week
[8:58] after sixty two weeks the massage gonna
[9:02] be cut off they totally rejected him at
[9:06] Calvary that were remember we looked at
[9:08] work cut off up that makes kill now they
[9:12] didn't kill him when he was starting you
[9:16] know I mean they ain't kill him 80 in
[9:18] this first part of his ministry the kill
[9:22] him at the end of his ministry alright
[9:23] so they killed him after sixty two weeks
[9:26] ago whistle 62 plus 7 is how much thank
[9:30] you 59 so there's no half weeks in here
[9:36] their wares one week left after the
[9:38] rapture you can't make me believe it any
[9:41] other way and I won't prove it to you a
[9:43] little bit further by dates okay you
[9:48] need to overhear work he was cut off the
[9:52] reason he was cut off with people I made
[9:55] those two Brendan gentle sin and that's
[9:58] why he's got seven more on me that's not
[10:00] exactly true he was cut off for
[10:03] everybody yeah I mean he was killed for
[10:06] sin he was killed for sin God blinded
[10:11] their eyes so that they couldn't come to
[10:15] the bay pick off but the man Pentecost
[10:18] was
[10:19] 30 days 40 days after he died so you
[10:23] can't really do that means you gotta be
[10:24] any days no he was cut off at 80 30 I
[10:28] have two three score 2 weeks he was cut
[10:29] off okay they rejected him he they said
[10:32] let his blood be on us and our children
[10:34] all right then God blinded their eyes
[10:37] now you can't say to that he glided ever
[10:39] do that cuz 120 up room Raji's now the
[10:45] 3000 downstairs were mingled we went
[10:49] over that you may go over to the game or
[10:50] damp and cough is a literal day remember
[10:54] we went through our our feast day Dave a
[10:59] tough day of Pentecost when the day of
[11:02] Pentecost was fully come what happened
[11:05] what people had gathered in from all
[11:06] over the nation's to celebrate the day
[11:09] of Pentecost okay could it wasn't a it
[11:12] was a day to come in and celebrate cuz
[11:14] it's viste so what happened to 3,000
[11:17] downstairs civil man we hear these
[11:20] people speaking in their own language
[11:21] and there was probably 70 or 80
[11:24] different languages standing out in this
[11:26] crowd and Peter's talking and they're
[11:29] all hearing them in their same language
[11:31] the three times intense start speaking
[11:34] in tongues to receive hope that's where
[11:36] the Pentecost will get wrong they said
[11:38] no you got speaking in tongues no it's
[11:40] not the stickiness to hearing we heard
[11:43] them all in our language so so what
[11:46] happened was when they received the Holy
[11:47] Ghost it fell been on three thousand
[11:49] people that were mingled on nations but
[11:54] the first hundred twenty was Jews what
[11:56] he done is is he blinded those eyes of
[11:59] the ones that said let his blood be on
[12:00] us in our children got it he blinded
[12:04] their eyes he blinded the nation of
[12:07] Israel remember Israel's not him
[12:10] individual that's why the 120 watched
[12:13] 120 any upper room where individuals yes
[12:17] they rent they were yeah he's all they
[12:19] were jus yeah they would
[12:19] used but they were individual people
[12:21] sitting in an upper ring the nation of
[12:24] Israel s'what turning God now all right
[12:28] the nation of is a question comprises
[12:30] people but really what happened is is to
[12:33] just make the bottom line the 144,000
[12:37] that was to be chosen wasn't there their
[12:43] ancestors were there okay because
[12:46] remember 144,000 gonna be saved over
[12:48] here not there they're gonna be safe
[12:50] here so the ancestors said let his blood
[12:53] be on us and our children had to go do a
[12:55] cleansing process report God blinded
[12:58] their eyes come all the way back over
[13:00] here and then all of a sudden he's going
[13:01] to what take the wall authorized or not
[13:04] say wool but take the veil thank you the
[13:07] bell off their eyes and they're going to
[13:10] see what their ancestors missed and then
[13:13] Israel still not as a nation get it
[13:15] right now remember it's not the nation
[13:17] of Israel not going to be safe that's
[13:18] right but you'll hear program say years
[13:21] will be saved as a nation now who's a
[13:23] nation who was the nation of Israel that
[13:26] was 144,000 well it was those twelve
[13:29] tribes the twelve tribes it mighta been
[13:32] hundred forty four thousand member they
[13:33] were millions back then hmm but there
[13:35] was twelve tribes Jesus Jesus will God
[13:38] Jesus told him said you got twelve
[13:40] tribes you got Ashley have 13 de lis box
[13:51] were not part of the twelve tribes of
[13:53] Israel remember it was once like you
[13:56] were speaking Wednesday night with you
[13:58] that was good good job the lead box was
[14:01] right here in the middle three three
[14:04] three and three now what is three times
[14:07] four equals and the Levites were not
[14:11] part of the twelve they were part of the
[14:13] ministry they were to minister to the
[14:16] people right now what happened to
[14:19] remember when what Dan and Ephraim was
[14:21] taken out Joseph and Levi was put in but
[14:27] to go back brother Brown remember he
[14:29] explains it in the in the seals
[14:33] they come right back into order because
[14:35] you gotta have it back in order to be
[14:37] the right crowd right okay got it now
[14:44] that's a whole new subject for a whole
[14:46] new day but when it says they were saved
[14:49] as a nation to visit because God's don't
[14:52] at the end that last half of the week
[14:55] he's only dealing with Israel he's not
[14:58] dealing with any Gentile he's not the
[15:00] last half of the way now the first time
[15:03] doing he's not doing well yeah when he's
[15:09] pulling out 144 first part of the way
[15:11] you gotta make sure everybody realize
[15:13] it's the first part of the week that
[15:14] happens not the last part that's what
[15:16] I'm telling you y'all get in the head
[15:17] you get in computing first half of the
[15:19] weeks is one to twelve hundred and sixty
[15:21] days that there is nobody here except
[15:25] the redeem that come back to build
[15:26] temple we're not even here we're not
[15:33] here we're not back to here yes ma'am
[15:38] the Levites are part of the twelves that
[15:41] mean you're happy
[15:42] that's a question you out that brother
[15:44] them he knows more about that night
[15:47] doing really i don't understand all that
[15:48] but i think he does and he lit he can
[15:51] explain that but really asking people of
[15:52] you to ask him that r and I'm not him
[15:54] are not putting you up I'm just saying I
[15:56] can't explain it in the time that we
[15:59] have to explain it but Dad preached on
[16:01] how long i mean you know several years
[16:03] ago about how God took the two tribes
[16:05] dominating put them back in and that's
[16:09] really interesting to know what happened
[16:11] when they do that but we're getting off
[16:13] our subject let's get back on his own
[16:16] okay hey wait yes ma'am is this way the
[16:19] rapture of the Jets on with that with
[16:20] that fake series black behind you get
[16:22] that is correct to a degree 2 degree
[16:27] that fakes here do you that baby it is
[16:34] it is not let stop say it's fake they
[16:37] were serious when they made
[16:38] misunderstood they were serious when
[16:40] they made it okay they made it in all
[16:43] sincerity with the light that they could
[16:45] see what I mean it was the Antichrist is
[16:47] that he has slipped into the
[16:49] denominational world taught them a
[16:52] doctrine that wasn't true and then they
[16:55] may dilute the other and that's correct
[16:57] cuz when we go when we leave when we
[17:01] leave the sea that's worthy you can
[17:04] leave the denominational world things we
[17:06] have a seven year tribulation they think
[17:08] it's going to happen here and that
[17:11] they're going to be saved because now
[17:13] what most of your denominational world
[17:16] plus that guy we were watching the other
[17:18] night jesus is coming back right here
[17:21] yeah if I see that right here what's
[17:24] happening in the denominational world
[17:26] there's going to be a rapture of a
[17:28] church right then there's going to be a
[17:31] great tribulation that people are going
[17:33] to be saved now this is not our doctrine
[17:35] this is the doctrine of the
[17:36] denominational church okay maybe this is
[17:38] why we did this okay to understand this
[17:41] better they say that we have a
[17:43] seven-year tribulation and it
[17:44] into the tribulation this is wherever
[17:46] i'll see and every knee shall bow in
[17:48] Jesus will come in the clouds of glory
[17:52] but remember the interpretation is wrong
[17:55] the interpretation is yeah he's coming
[17:56] back right here but he's not coming back
[17:58] to get somebody he's coming back with
[18:01] somebody paid okay he's already picked
[18:05] her up in a secret rapture yeah the
[18:08] denominational world's don't have to be
[18:09] killed for the gospel that they hold on
[18:13] to but now look when they die they gotta
[18:16] go to a thousand years of staying there
[18:18] Google in Revelation this is those that
[18:20] died have lived not till the thousand
[18:24] years and over you say well I center
[18:26] yeah that's centers but it's also people
[18:29] that are saved foods version a cup of
[18:33] water my name anybody's been going to be
[18:35] giving eternal life that hasn't already
[18:37] received eternal life here one so
[18:40] important to receive a new birth here
[18:44] because you're going to stand over here
[18:47] from your own words remember bill
[18:50] Deltron my chosen in him that's the
[18:52] reason we don't go to no tribulation we
[18:54] took it right here so we're chosen in
[18:58] that man that took our tribulation so we
[19:01] go in after day week on rapture we're
[19:05] clean we've already got a glorified body
[19:08] we don't have any new steps to take the
[19:12] milk a with that but now right here if
[19:14] you're still a Gentile and you're alive
[19:16] when they're apt to take play you've got
[19:18] steps to go through you got it you're
[19:20] either going to turn got down and go to
[19:22] hell and not going to hell here that's
[19:26] why you're not in heaven or hell now
[19:27] you're in a you're in a holding place my
[19:29] brother Brown don't have to go to those
[19:30] dimensions to show that you're not in a
[19:33] literal burning hell right now you're
[19:34] not
[19:35] literal heaven you're not grandma's not
[19:37] walking the streets ago she's sitting
[19:41] over there under a shade tree talking to
[19:42] brother branham on a rock all right and
[19:46] they're waiting on us right okay so but
[19:53] when we resurrect and going to rapture
[19:54] then we go to the marriage supper room
[19:57] we do the things that we do there but
[19:59] we're coming back right here terrain a
[20:01] thousand years which is not heaven
[20:05] heavens not go to the future home I'm
[20:07] Way over here that's when the streets of
[20:11] gold in Revelation 21 or 22 when John
[20:15] sees the holy city coming down I've way
[20:18] over here remember and we're that's why
[20:20] we're going to piece this together
[20:21] because the Bible says we will build and
[20:23] have it and I was at 65 that's not the
[20:27] future home that's not heaven that's
[20:30] right that's here on earth yes we're not
[20:33] going to build a house up there I think
[20:34] he just said I'm going to build you a
[20:36] play right right well it's not it's your
[20:39] building it is you're building your
[20:42] desires but right here is one of those
[20:46] going to be or my brother brother I
[20:48] believe had to explain there's going to
[20:49] be a little temple built according to 0
[20:51] 42 44 there's dimension to feel we're
[20:53] going to read a little bit later on but
[20:55] as if you're 40 44 skills the dimension
[20:57] now one we've got set down right
[20:59] dimensions and tell you how to build it
[21:02] come on tell them the time of night you
[21:04] know hey you need to be able to travel
[21:05] this soap hi and have so many pillars
[21:07] and like you said have so many great
[21:09] things over that all meant something
[21:11] doctors didn't say how you always throw
[21:13] a couple of sticks together put ten up
[21:16] you know throw the ark in there no he
[21:18] told them exactly how to do it and you
[21:21] know what they did it as close as they
[21:23] could do it they did it what's the same
[21:25] thing with the Millennium temple that
[21:27] thing's going to be built according to
[21:29] Ezekiel 42 44 all right so we gotta get
[21:35] is sister Regina said you know back over
[21:38] here work off so all this is going to
[21:41] happen after we leave that's why I
[21:44] believe that brother branham when he
[21:45] preached down 70 weeks he didn't preach
[21:47] it in depth anymore because it's not to
[21:50] us he hits it in day of 70 weeks he hits
[21:54] it in certain other places but this is
[21:56] not this the happenings between here if
[22:00] you're still here you're in another
[22:01] group you're in another group you're not
[22:06] bright you never will be bribed you're
[22:08] not going to come up and be right over
[22:10] here you either that's my brother
[22:14] promises you're you're you're here what
[22:15] you're going to be back that's right if
[22:18] you don't have the new work here you
[22:19] know gonna have it there now you can be
[22:20] given eternal life an impartation to be
[22:23] kind of line but you will not have it as
[22:26] a possession so you're going to have to
[22:28] stand over here to wipe your judgment
[22:30] and be judged by your work that's what
[22:33] revelation says in Revelations 20 or 21
[22:36] it says when the books were opened they
[22:38] were judged by their works that's right
[22:40] I don't want standing I don't stand
[22:44] about my work the deeds done in the body
[22:47] is the wrong we do that somewhere in
[22:50] here but you know what if I get more
[22:54] flying body here and I'm change if I die
[22:57] and go by the grave even some of y'all
[22:58] have to get me up out of the ground
[22:59] ain't going worry about that I really
[23:02] not that's but but it's real simple to
[23:06] realize the Bible says some men's sins
[23:08] go before them some follow so what
[23:12] happens is is you sense in a sense they
[23:14] can stand against Bob that goes before
[23:16] God it's recorded not a sin of both yeah
[23:24] are not a sin of god forbid let's just
[23:28] you just as this horrible example I
[23:30] started running around with your wife
[23:31] you asked you to forgive me you said i
[23:35] forgiven i said i'm not a Christian if I
[23:36] did that I really don't think so not in
[23:39] this town now I might have happened
[23:40] before now run around maybe some people
[23:42] back during his time that
[23:43] right around on each other and he told
[23:44] them he one of them you know they got
[23:47] back together and he said they were real
[23:48] Christian but you don't know what
[23:50] happened in between all that time he not
[23:52] a lot not have been wondering the time
[23:53] all right so say it see that's not what
[23:56] oh man I'm talking my something I say
[23:58] against Bob that hurts our feelings are
[24:00] our or you know even you can say
[24:03] something bad about it and then I go on
[24:05] we'll see that sin though if I say come
[24:08] back say buh i said something up
[24:10] honestly forgive me and I said orden
[24:13] about to cry look at the power of
[24:17] forgiveness though now they Bob forgive
[24:20] me or did the Holy Ghost forgive me the
[24:22] Holy Ghost forgave me Bob as a human the
[24:24] filter forgave me it don't go before now
[24:33] if I don't it follows me they got it now
[24:37] if I don't if I if I just say wow he
[24:40] really is what I see convince myself you
[24:45] know the rotten scoundrel I'll teach
[24:47] Danny anyway but well that's great I'm
[24:55] bride now this is not in my soul this is
[24:57] in my humanity in ladder memory reason
[25:00] conscious of face imagination there's
[25:03] still the devil's playground so if i say
[25:06] Bob forgive me that goes up against the
[25:09] blood goes through the blood never to be
[25:11] saying again now if I retain that and I
[25:17] go by the grave or if I die in or with
[25:21] the new verb or even if I like a body
[25:22] chain which I don't know that you can do
[25:25] that if you got all that later Oh Avery
[25:27] baby gramps it won't be a few take buddy
[25:30] chain anyway so I go by the grave and I
[25:32] come up glorified body but I still that
[25:36] sin has got to go before God because we
[25:38] didn't take care of it here device
[25:41] that's why that scripture says some men
[25:43] go before in other words pepper and some
[25:47] power because it's following you it's
[25:48] going with you and when you go not to a
[25:51] white grumble
[25:52] we get out to heaven then you know
[25:54] what's going to be revealed about then I
[25:56] had that problem with it and then we're
[25:58] going to make it right okay this is what
[26:03] i don't understand let me give you this
[26:04] this is I don't understand that after we
[26:07] get a glorified body and we go to the
[26:08] marriage supper the Bible says that
[26:10] Jesus will come around and wipe the
[26:12] tears from our eyes right I don't are we
[26:17] going to be able to cry in heaven I
[26:18] don't know I don't know what lesson that
[26:19] transition area or potential what the
[26:22] Bible says about said you wanted here
[26:24] for my eyes say entry into the gyorko
[26:26] that's us selling to mention epicurious
[26:28] may be joyous tears no Canadian to the
[26:33] joy when you had that problem with
[26:35] somebody you go to him and you ask for
[26:36] forgiveness and you truly want
[26:38] forgiveness you do but he doesn't
[26:40] forgive you you know what that does the
[26:43] Bible says that heaps on to him and he's
[26:47] got to carry you you that's correct it
[26:50] yes it's not it's really not a two-way
[26:53] street he doesn't have to forgive you
[26:56] right but what happens the Bible says
[26:58] remember forgive and if you're not if
[27:01] you can't forgive whatever baby is is
[27:04] going to be heaped on you so if he don't
[27:06] forgive you then every bit of that I
[27:09] mean you're just relieved is you can be
[27:10] but that thing's going to be on him and
[27:12] he's going to have to watch but it's
[27:14] going to follow him to a judgment of the
[27:18] deeds done in the body whether good or
[27:20] bad not all right so now you gotta deal
[27:27] with it ok I am main man see what I mean
[27:30] you know so we just get this thing
[27:32] cleared out but that's what that's what
[27:34] we're worth looking here when we go up
[27:37] in a rapture we're done the Gentiles are
[27:41] finished there's no more Gentile save
[27:43] what i mean by saved is there's no more
[27:46] Gentile gonna go to receive the new
[27:48] birth come but no okay because you are
[27:50] truly you are saved if you're just five
[27:53] sanctified and you really try to see you
[27:57] know what it goes back to one thing God
[27:59] knows you are
[28:01] God the only one who knows if you really
[28:03] want to be justified or if you really
[28:05] want to be sanctified and there's some
[28:08] people out there that are trying to find
[28:11] truth in the denominational world and it
[28:13] can claim when a whose fault is that
[28:15] mess the Bible says is you won't go in
[28:18] talks about the preachers you won't go
[28:21] in and you won't let you people go in so
[28:24] they're stopped some preachers preachers
[28:26] stop them from going on with God right
[28:30] yeah and that's why I was thinking just
[28:32] few minutes ago and when we say tying up
[28:35] of loose ends because the tree was
[28:39] asking me about a website that I went to
[28:40] that Kingdom son 777 we were sitting
[28:43] there watching the next House of the
[28:44] nightman de-momming and you think the
[28:47] guy red brother around seventy weeks of
[28:49] Daniel book to a point then he goes off
[28:53] we'll see that's when the Rope does this
[28:56] do you understand what I'm saying
[28:58] there's a rope of truth this is God's
[29:02] truth right here this is God's the line
[29:05] now what this man did man's idea comes
[29:09] the rope Lord Jesus Christ baptism
[29:13] father son Holy go good so that's what
[29:18] brother Brown said that that seventh
[29:20] church age messenger come back to what
[29:21] tie up the loose ends so he took what
[29:24] was dangling picked it up like this tied
[29:27] a knot in it pulling it tight and put it
[29:29] right back together so that's what we're
[29:31] looking at I said by divine inspiration
[29:34] and interpretation we have what this
[29:36] book says and like I was explaining it
[29:39] brother Joe green collects marking that
[29:43] tree they didn't help Deitrick he had
[29:47] truth hey he he preached this bearing
[29:49] people on the message you know what that
[29:51] wasn't the devil the devil can't creaks
[29:55] OH truth in pre some became result but
[29:59] Claire's Larkin did not have the divine
[30:02] inspiration and interpretation with a
[30:04] message behind it there's one of the
[30:08] contention and the message was is that
[30:09] that the clamp Larkin had all this
[30:12] revelation
[30:12] for brother Ram did he just copied it no
[30:15] he didn't copy it he studied it just
[30:17] like you and I stood just like I studied
[30:19] that guy just like a colony internet and
[30:21] I took all the loose ends that were
[30:23] dangling because most of them even that
[30:24] guy shows how these denominational
[30:28] minded if jesus is coming back at the
[30:31] end of the 70th week well he is but it
[30:37] all like they say that's a loose in
[30:39] brother brown show truly we're going out
[30:42] of here before you even deal for the
[30:44] Jews ok so that's a loose then that's
[30:47] tied up that I don't have to listen to
[30:48] that but now all the other stuff that he
[30:50] said I enjoyed it was really good swear
[30:54] I got some of them some of the things
[30:56] that we're going to piece together I
[30:57] think that's what it is in the end time
[31:00] I'm not making them down myself a
[31:02] brother Baylor anybody in this church
[31:04] but we will dig to try to find the
[31:10] things that like daddy says that people
[31:13] out in the message now daddy same two
[31:15] weeks buddy it's like a it's like a
[31:17] venereal disease i'm not kidding let's
[31:18] just make it that strong that they dont
[31:24] dont preach on it but if there's a
[31:27] question in the people's my brother and
[31:29] I remember many times he'd say a
[31:31] question in the people's mind we'll see
[31:34] if there's a question in your mind
[31:35] that's what the devil can just sit there
[31:38] and that's what's happening now the
[31:39] questions that people have harbored for
[31:42] years in this message that had it in her
[31:44] mind the devil's finally what about this
[31:47] were you worried about this and nobody's
[31:50] ever strained it out what's brother
[31:52] branham right or was he wrong with you
[31:55] this class Larkin had this truth before
[31:57] he did clamps Larkin had a piece of hay
[31:59] Schofield Schofield died before brother
[32:02] branham came home in the earth and he
[32:05] talked about the Alpha knee but he
[32:08] couldn't put it all together he talks
[32:10] about the Holy Ghost off my son of God
[32:12] talk my son of man be tops my name is
[32:15] the third person of the Trinity too so
[32:16] see you there that's when that rope
[32:18] though that's when the road gets cut so
[32:22] the property God comes with the
[32:23] anointing of alive
[32:25] what is Elijah he's a restoration
[32:27] ministry amen take the regional Elijah
[32:31] what'd he do when he got a full mount
[32:33] carmel and all them 400 prophets of bail
[32:35] they jumped up on the offer so much they
[32:37] flattened it the Bible says they just
[32:39] flattened the whole Walter first thing
[32:41] Elijah done he didn't start bless God
[32:44] this and start you know screaming no the
[32:47] Bible says he repaired the altar why he
[32:50] had to prepare that altar so God could
[32:52] come there's no way guys not does not
[32:55] gonna come unless there's an ultra
[32:56] better but when he built the altar
[32:59] what'd he do fire out of heaven comes
[33:01] down consumes everything even such a
[33:04] water out knocks the water will see a
[33:05] larger the alliant ministry is a
[33:07] restoration of ministry so yo brother
[33:10] branham would be the same way it's a
[33:12] restoration ministry that Clarence
[33:15] Larkin couldn't get it all together
[33:16] Scofield couldn't get it all together
[33:19] moody couldn't get it all together
[33:21] Calvin couldn't get it all together
[33:23] because Calvin had truth but I'm dead
[33:25] Calvin did have three basic Calvin was a
[33:27] rascal why because he went way over on
[33:30] this side of predestination and then the
[33:33] other ones go way over on this side
[33:35] remember the vision brother Graham said
[33:37] I took a branch from this one not saying
[33:39] the tree was false took a branch from
[33:41] this one and a branch from this one
[33:43] stuck him in the ground and became a
[33:45] great tree what he was doing a
[33:47] restoration ministry so that's what
[33:49] brother Ram you gotta know one thing for
[33:51] sure he is doing a restoration ministry
[33:53] but he is gone you show do you mean
[33:58] you're tying up the prophets listening
[33:59] no I'm explaining to you how that man
[34:03] has done it again people in this message
[34:06] have have cut the rope again we just
[34:10] trying to get the Rope back together as
[34:12] much as we can't brother I was just
[34:14] going to say that that I'm sure when it
[34:16] Elijah was restored that the two officer
[34:19] you have to grab some of the pieces that
[34:21] were already there too and everything
[34:23] exactly he didn't take the different set
[34:25] of rock you know he took the rock that
[34:27] the revelation was built on
[34:29] but who beat it down the 400 false
[34:32] prophets beat the original beat the
[34:37] original altar down Elijah reaches over
[34:41] and gets this one and puts a ride
[34:42] backwards supposed to go he reaches and
[34:44] get additional father son Holy Ghost
[34:45] baptisms not right puts it right here
[34:47] one God not of Trinity puts you right
[34:49] back Daniel seventy weeks it's not going
[34:51] to be huge is coming at the end of the
[34:53] 70th week he's coming they won't come
[34:55] out there is restarting back who else
[34:57] can you say that Daniel 70 weeks is to
[35:02] the chills just reading scores yes watch
[35:06] the swipe the first lecture talks a
[35:09] third pull the third pole is what to the
[35:11] church to the bride and totally lost was
[35:14] to three different sense of people Dinah
[35:17] seventy weeks to me shows me retention
[35:19] my Redemption and what God is doing to
[35:23] me but you know what he's doing he's
[35:24] doing it to me here right he's going to
[35:29] do it to them here right alright so take
[35:33] this right here and just bring it back

[36:07] just don't get ahead let's let the Bible
[36:09] from now on look let's let the Bible in
[36:12] the prophets message a little bit of
[36:13] this in force and we're going to sweep
[36:15] from here we're going to sweep from here
