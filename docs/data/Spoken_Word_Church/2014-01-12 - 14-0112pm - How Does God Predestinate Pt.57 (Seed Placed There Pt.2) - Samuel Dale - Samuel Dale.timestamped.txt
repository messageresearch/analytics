[21:57] reading from Roman Romans
[21:59] 8 and
[22:00] then we will go to Revelations
[22:04] 13 and kind of Cu thought on through the
[22:07] word remember Wade and Jun and them
[22:09] traveling home this afternoon and
[22:11] brother Bob and them coming back from
[22:13] Alabama and remember them just pray the
[22:15] Lord would be with them uh I called a
[22:18] check on Abby said she was doing better
[22:20] they're watching in and so praise the
[22:23] Lord for that and just pray that the
[22:26] Lord would be with each one with uh
[22:30] remember the fellowship meeting will be
[22:31] this coming Saturday over at brother Tom
[22:34] kain's in Sweetwater Tennessee so if
[22:37] you're wanting to go with us now make
[22:38] sure you let us know ahead of time where
[22:41] we won't be uh we have to be trying to
[22:43] get everything together but we have to
[22:45] leave uh from our home there at least by
[22:49] 10:00 because it's a far up there to
[22:53] it's the hardest run we have of not as
[22:56] many miles but it's a hardest one
[22:58] because it's all way through the
[22:59] mountains so just you know and if it
[23:02] comes any snow and things up in that way
[23:04] we will be uh saying y'all have
[23:07] it we we won't want to worry about it
[23:10] but just remember that good to see
[23:12] brother sister West and family back
[23:14] there with us
[23:17] and any other announcements I generally
[23:20] miss
[23:24] something okay I get okay so all right
[23:28] okay Heavenly Father we thank you Lord
[23:30] for this day in your grace unto us we
[23:32] thank you for all things and we pray
[23:34] that you would just bless us with your
[23:36] understanding and may your presence be
[23:39] with each one of us because that's what
[23:41] we desire more than anything else we ask
[23:43] you to come and speak to us as we read
[23:45] your word that you would come and speak
[23:48] to us from your word to show us the hour
[23:50] and the time that we're living because
[23:52] that's what we need to talk about all of
[23:54] the others in the Bible that have
[23:56] already lived their hour our and time is
[23:59] wonderful but yet to see our day and its
[24:02] message and where we're living in the
[24:04] time we are here upon the Earth is the
[24:07] most important thing unto us we love you
[24:09] and we thank you just have your way
[24:11] bless W and them as they traveling
[24:13] bobing them and just have your way with
[24:15] each and every one of us thank you for
[24:17] touching L Abby and thank you for being
[24:19] with all of the sick because you
[24:21] promised it so we believe you and guide
[24:23] us all now and keep us in Jesus name
[24:26] amen
[24:29] Romans
[24:34] 8 for we know that all things work
[24:36] together for good to them that love God
[24:39] to them who are the called according to
[24:41] his purpose for whom he did for know he
[24:44] did also
[24:45] predestinate to be conformed to the
[24:47] image of his son that he might be the
[24:49] firstborn among many Brethren or whom he
[24:52] did
[24:53] predestinate them he also called look at
[24:56] it it's already pised
[24:58] right right and whom he called them he
[25:01] also Justified and whom he justified
[25:03] them he also glorified all that's P
[25:05] tense all right and what does it say
[25:09] what shall we then say to these things
[25:11] if God be for us who can be against us
[25:14] wonderful all right
[25:17] Revelations uh
[25:18] 138 and all that dwell upon the Earth
[25:21] shall worship Him whose names are not
[25:23] written in the Book of Life of the lamb
[25:26] slain from the foundation of the world
[25:29] and if any man have an ear let him hear
[25:33] he that leadth into captivity shall go
[25:35] into captivity he that kth with a sword
[25:37] must be killed with a sword here is the
[25:40] patience and faith of the Saints you may
[25:42] be seated Lord that is blessing to the
[25:44] reading of the word now remember what we
[25:46] were saying about that this
[25:49] morning
[25:52] that if we get off the
[25:55] word you know if I get off the word
[25:57] preaching the word to you and you keep
[25:59] following that then I will be in
[26:01] captivity to my own personal ideas and
[26:04] thoughts and you will be in captivity to
[26:07] what I think in my doing so you better
[26:10] check out to see whether or not uh the
[26:13] word is being preached and then if it is
[26:16] then we follow after that and try to
[26:19] fall in that line and category right all
[26:22] right now uh my point my thought we'll
[26:25] get to it in a minute but I want you to
[26:27] to to get a little bit of understanding
[26:30] like I said there in Romans it it says
[26:33] that you know uh those that he he he
[26:38] predestinated
[26:40] already then uh he
[26:44] called those he called he's
[26:47] Justified those he justified he's
[26:49] already glorified sir now that's God
[26:54] looking at you and I right amen now
[26:59] that's not us looking at each other
[27:01] right that's not us looking at our own
[27:04] selves that's God looking down and
[27:07] seeing it because it's already passed as
[27:10] far as he's concerned all right then
[27:13] that way we need to look at the word of
[27:15] God in that form when the prophets would
[27:18] get stand up and and they would speak
[27:21] something as na non we say you know
[27:24] talking about chariots josling in the
[27:26] streets running like lightning you know
[27:29] torches and things he would be looking
[27:31] down to seeing Buicks old mobiles
[27:34] running into each other on the
[27:35] expressway with headlights on you know I
[27:37] mean that's simple understanding all
[27:39] right but as far as we are
[27:43] concerned uh we had to wait until back
[27:47] you know so many years
[27:49] ago uh before that could be made
[27:52] manifest all right but see when God says
[27:55] something it's already finished
[27:58] amen that's right he doesn't look at
[28:00] anything you know now I believe I'm I'm
[28:03] honest and I really appreciate the
[28:05] prophet of God when he said it one day
[28:06] he said that God saw all of this and
[28:09] knew what would happen but said he
[28:10] didn't stay back there said he came down
[28:13] to live with us I believe he's here
[28:15] right now he he's not he's not out there
[28:18] waiting on us he's here right now
[28:20] because if you'll think about this then
[28:23] you will understand the Bible better
[28:26] that as far as as God is concerned he
[28:28] looks at things as present
[28:30] tense that's why when he spoke to Moses
[28:33] he said I am that I
[28:35] am all right that's as present tense as
[28:38] you can get I am that I am that's right
[28:42] that's present tense that's not future
[28:44] tense that's not past
[28:46] tense all right see as far as God is
[28:49] concerned when he speaks something
[28:51] that's already done all right we read
[28:53] there we'll get back to it in a minute
[28:54] where the names were written in the L
[28:57] the book book of the life of the lamb
[28:58] slame before the foundation of the
[29:01] world that was in God's
[29:03] mind it was not in a
[29:07] reality because you'd have to wait until
[29:09] we come down here to manifest it all
[29:12] right Jesus Christ stood as a lamb slain
[29:14] before the foundation of the world but
[29:16] that means god is looking at all of the
[29:21] life and the things of Earth and as far
[29:24] as he sees it it's not even a
[29:29] second you know we talk about a thousand
[29:31] years as a day and a day a thousand
[29:33] years and say well Jesus was here two
[29:35] days ago you know because we talk about
[29:37] a thousand years but see really in
[29:40] reality before the world ever
[29:44] begun before anything ever come into
[29:48] being he already knew and if we don't
[29:51] believe him to be like that then what
[29:52] kind of a god do we have he would just
[29:55] be like me and you he would be
[29:56] constantly learning or are getting a
[29:58] better way of doing something or you
[30:00] know things maybe work out but no if
[30:04] we'll look at it then we can understand
[30:07] why brother brandom preaches as he
[30:10] does listen to him about it he talks
[30:14] about things as being here that's what
[30:18] caught me as I told you when I came into
[30:20] the message you know I heard a man
[30:23] talking
[30:25] about a God that existed right you know
[30:31] not up y under well y under or something
[30:34] happened you know no he was talking
[30:37] about God right
[30:40] there and see he wasn't looking out to
[30:43] the future he would speak of that God
[30:46] would speak of the future but just
[30:49] remember when God speaks of the future
[30:51] the future is
[30:53] present you understand what I'm getting
[30:56] at you know if we can't believe God that
[30:59] way then what kind of a god do we
[31:02] have when that Prophet would say
[31:04] something Isaiah said a virgin shall
[31:09] conceive as far as what he said it was
[31:12] already done why it had been spoken
[31:15] remember the other night Wednesday night
[31:17] talking about the thoughts of God you
[31:19] know how that the thoughts of God are
[31:22] Eternal but yet he's got to speak it to
[31:24] you and me right and he say thought
[31:27] until he speaks it to you and I are the
[31:29] prophets and you know it was God's
[31:31] thought he transmitted it to Moses right
[31:34] it became Moses has t that's right all
[31:37] right
[31:38] then once it did that then Moses when he
[31:41] was speaking it was the word and it
[31:44] could be written down you know pin or
[31:46] whatever because it would be the the the
[31:48] point all right but getting to a to the
[31:54] thought why don't we read The Prophet's
[31:56] message
[31:58] as we read the Bible then if we believe
[32:00] the Bible to be that
[32:05] way and in that message we can see that
[32:09] he was trying to get us not to look to
[32:12] the
[32:13] Future although they're you know it's
[32:16] fine but what are we trying to
[32:18] do you know what do we want to know the
[32:21] future for I think about this the other
[32:22] day I thought you know if we if if if I
[32:27] knew something could tell you would that
[32:28] help your
[32:31] faith you
[32:32] know I mean and now sister Anna I'd say
[32:35] and sister Anna tomorrow so and so is
[32:38] going to
[32:39] happen does that help your
[32:41] faith your faith ought to be anchored in
[32:44] God's
[32:45] word that would be fine because that's
[32:48] that's good but you know what it would
[32:50] do to most people scare
[32:54] them right cuzz didn't they say every
[32:58] time we got around brother Dale what are
[32:59] you going to
[33:01] say you going to tell me
[33:04] something see you get
[33:06] scared well instead of it happen it'd be
[33:09] a
[33:10] hindrance but see in
[33:13] God there is no future the prophet said
[33:17] that here's where mankind messes
[33:19] up always looking back to what God
[33:22] was looking to forward to what will be
[33:26] and forgetting what's taking place
[33:30] now God's not up in
[33:33] heaven he's here with you and I amen
[33:37] he's not over under on the other side
[33:39] waiting on us to get
[33:42] there he's here with
[33:45] us the Rapture is him taking us
[33:50] there but to do that he's got to be
[33:54] here so then when we read that your name
[33:56] was written in the L book of life before
[33:58] the foundation of the
[34:00] world just remember we've been through
[34:04] it we've been over it up and
[34:06] down that God in his forn knowledge knew
[34:11] you would want to be
[34:13] saved and thereby he could write your
[34:15] name in the
[34:17] book see but then when a prophet brings
[34:21] that
[34:22] thought listen you you just do it
[34:24] sometime just just put on any tape
[34:28] and you just listen to that tape with
[34:30] the intent of following Brother
[34:35] bradam and that's why all this date
[34:37] problems has got into all of
[34:39] it because sometimes him being a prophet
[34:42] he'll say it happened two days ago it
[34:44] might have been 10 years
[34:46] ago I know I do the same thing I'll
[34:50] say I'll say sometime I preached on that
[34:52] a couple of years ago well it say 10 you
[34:58] well you know I I'm beginning to get our
[35:02] old enough and childish enough to just
[35:06] want to stay where I'm
[35:08] at w worry about
[35:12] tomorrow I me come on seriously church I
[35:15] mean one one day brother around said it
[35:17] like this he said right around the
[35:19] coming of the
[35:20] lord your jobs wouldn't going to be
[35:23] important right now did he say quit your
[35:27] job
[35:29] no he said if you know what you had in
[35:32] your pocket as money you would take it
[35:35] out and burn it did he take it out and
[35:38] burn it
[35:39] no so it's
[35:43] different but what we need to do is just
[35:46] settle down and say okay Lord speak to
[35:48] me that's right
[35:50] today not not tomorrow don't tell me
[35:52] about
[35:53] tomorrow must scare me to
[35:55] death
[35:57] you wind up like that guy would have
[35:58] told
[35:59] you got a newspaper a day ahead of time
[36:02] you
[36:02] know a man he could he could win the
[36:05] lottery he could play on the horse races
[36:07] he could do everything cuz he got a
[36:09] paper newspaper
[36:12] Dee but one day he picked up and read an
[36:14] obituary that he died the day
[36:17] before so that give you a lot of fits
[36:19] wouldn't it so future what are we
[36:21] concerned about the future let's be
[36:23] concerned about the present tense and
[36:26] then we'll be doing as God is dealing
[36:28] and we'll be doing as the prophet of God
[36:30] is doing and when he says you always was
[36:34] eternal that's where we kind of ended up
[36:38] right did that mean we was always
[36:40] saved that we didn't need to be saved
[36:44] the same message which is the future
[36:46] home he spends great length of time
[36:51] explaining the new
[36:53] birth up page 15 16 17 future
[36:57] home the whole message is basically
[37:00] dealing with a new
[37:02] birth and he said if you don't get
[37:05] nothing get this Plan of Redemption
[37:09] right then he come along like we was
[37:11] reading and he says you always was
[37:16] eternal well you know I could say
[37:22] Amen because
[37:25] if he's speaking as God
[37:30] speaks
[37:32] right then I can say Amen to it but if
[37:36] he's speaking like me and you
[37:38] talk I can say oh
[37:41] me know it won't
[37:43] work and that's made a lot of people
[37:45] just believe say you know always was
[37:48] eternal but then you don't need Jesus
[37:50] Christ to come and
[37:52] die see he's done away with the entire
[37:55] Plan of Redemption
[38:00] and that's man's ideas see that's what I
[38:04] talking about this morning taking part
[38:06] of the
[38:06] word and our own
[38:09] ideas put them
[38:11] together and what do we got a hybrid
[38:16] condition there's not a
[38:19] denomination in the world that doesn't
[38:22] claim to be speaking for
[38:25] God right
[38:27] and claiming what they believe is the
[38:30] word of God is that
[38:33] true but now how can God be that
[38:36] confused well the Lord showed me there
[38:38] was a he gave me a vision there was a
[38:40] trinity but how can you do that when it
[38:42] doesn't
[38:44] exist
[38:46] right but yet we can be so spiritual
[38:50] see you know we we think we've got it
[38:52] all figured
[38:55] out
[38:57] instead of then believing that God is
[38:59] trying his best to reveal the Plan of
[39:05] Redemption and revealing himself to
[39:09] us then we can understand what we've
[39:11] reading this morning reading what where
[39:13] he said you wasn't saved on any day you
[39:17] was always
[39:20] saved Now read the book all the way over
[39:24] to that statement
[39:28] and tell me that he wasn't explaining
[39:31] how it is to be born again the very
[39:33] steps and the very thing and he said I
[39:35] taught this from the from the
[39:39] beginning but a lot of people that's
[39:43] 1964 I think it is yeah but a lot of
[39:47] people say well he changed after the
[39:48] seals
[39:51] broke he said I've taught it from the
[39:55] beginning he's speaking in the tense of
[39:58] God you know what I mean tense in other
[40:00] words present tense a prophet speaks in
[40:03] present tense now listen to what I'm
[40:05] saying a revelation to you and
[40:08] I will be in the present
[40:11] tense
[40:14] right and I know I I hit a little touchy
[40:17] spot there this
[40:19] morning because a lot of people will
[40:21] take bre around them and they'll say and
[40:23] he does say it he said see that little
[40:24] woman at the well
[40:27] he said that little woman at the well
[40:28] said it was quickened to
[40:30] her that he was the
[40:33] Messiah and said that seed come to life
[40:35] now I I'll come back in another message
[40:38] on down the road and read a lot of these
[40:40] CU I want you to read
[40:43] them what you say that seed was
[40:45] quickened or did it give her eternal
[40:50] life did Mary carrying the very God
[40:54] himself in her wound
[40:57] did that give her eternal
[40:59] life
[41:00] no she even denied him as I said this
[41:04] morning said when he was over about 12
[41:07] years old said your father and I
[41:10] claiming he wasn't even virgin
[41:12] born don't sound like she had eternal
[41:15] life but see we want to take this to
[41:19] thoughts and we just cram them in you
[41:22] know
[41:24] and you can have a
[41:28] revelation without having the new
[41:32] birth right you think about
[41:37] it there's people healed all over the
[41:39] world today
[41:40] right is it required to have the new
[41:42] birth to be healed no it's required to
[41:45] have
[41:50] faith now they didn't doing that
[41:53] then they said about Peter there he was
[41:58] th aren't the Christ the son of the
[41:59] Living God that was made alive to Peter
[42:03] but it did he did it give him the new
[42:05] birth
[42:07] no he had to go to the upper room right
[42:11] right so now here's the way I
[42:15] do I look at things and then I I come
[42:18] down in my own
[42:21] mind which is the only way you can do it
[42:23] so don't get this all super duper
[42:25] revelation you think everything starts
[42:28] in your brain in your
[42:31] mind just because it's in your mind
[42:33] didn't put it in your
[42:36] heart all right and see when I look at
[42:39] something I look at it as well as I can
[42:42] to see well hey wait a
[42:44] minute if this is so then what I used to
[42:47] think about this can't be
[42:51] so if there's just one
[42:54] God then what I thought about the
[42:58] Trinity was
[43:00] wrong you
[43:03] agree see then I'm looking at things and
[43:08] I've always tried to do it that way to
[43:10] where that just like that point we're
[43:12] talking about if you always was eternal
[43:15] then you don't need
[43:17] Jesus
[43:21] okay now so this is the way I
[43:24] think if we don't need need
[43:27] Jesus you
[43:29] know we always was we don't need Jesus
[43:34] you said oh no people are not saying
[43:36] that that's the deceiving part right
[43:41] because I've heard people
[43:44] preach and you have too that Jesus
[43:48] Christ is almighty
[43:51] God and then turn around and make him a
[43:54] Trinity right that's right come on you
[43:58] heard that when years in the
[43:59] denomination they preach he's almighty
[44:02] God but then that a while it's back well
[44:04] it's just in three persons you
[44:07] know well now I'm like
[44:10] this if I always was eternal I don't
[44:13] need Jesus are you with
[44:17] me but if I admit I need
[44:24] Jesus okay
[44:28] I know I'm tricky ain't
[44:31] I sister Gail if you believe you need
[44:34] Jesus
[44:35] Christ to save you you needed him to
[44:38] give you a new birth and you know for
[44:41] certain you wouldn't Eternal like
[44:43] mankind is
[44:47] say that's a certainty that's not a
[44:49] question or thought or a point that's a
[44:52] statement of FL a fact that's right if I
[44:55] say that I was lost and I am now
[45:02] saved then when a prophet would say you
[45:05] always was eternal that's not throwing
[45:07] me
[45:10] why Paul said in
[45:13] Romans
[45:15] right I've read that 56 57
[45:22] times and in that Paul said those who
[45:25] justify
[45:26] is already
[45:29] glorified well then Paul was saying we
[45:32] always was
[45:35] eternal was that what he was
[45:40] saying you see where our minds he said
[45:44] brother Dale you just confuse me I never
[45:47] confuse
[45:49] nobody I'm sorry my wording and my way
[45:52] of speaking has confused people yes I'm
[45:57] sorry but you tell me how else you can
[46:00] get to the
[46:01] truth you know
[46:03] what I mean you believe all your
[46:07] life this is my left
[46:10] hand no no no no no no that's your right
[46:13] hand cuz that's what we always
[46:15] believe well if I'm turning this away
[46:18] which one is
[46:21] it did you get it which one is my right
[46:25] hand
[46:27] you said that no no to you that's my
[46:30] left
[46:32] one right you said you're a dummy I
[46:35] agree what a good
[46:38] point look in the mirror and tell me
[46:40] which one's your right hand in your left
[46:43] hand my wife always has trouble with it
[46:46] I've had her to tell me honey you got to
[46:48] turn left you got to You' doing you got
[46:50] to turn left you got to turn to the
[46:53] left I said honey uh would you raise
[46:57] your right hand
[47:01] oh cuz we're all out
[47:04] way put up four or five mirrors and
[47:07] reflect yourself through it and then
[47:08] raise which is your right hand you know
[47:11] what I mean turn this where tap that
[47:12] turn it and which is your right hand
[47:15] this is what we've been
[47:18] taught we've been taught there a trinity
[47:21] we've been taught as this we've been
[47:22] taught as
[47:24] that we've been taught we we don't need
[47:27] prophets you didn't come through the
[47:29] Baptist oh that was our we don't need
[47:32] prophets no
[47:34] more oh yeah we'll take evangelists and
[47:37] pastors and sometimes a teacher but we
[47:40] don't need prophets CU Jesus Christ had
[47:43] all already spoke to us that's right
[47:47] well look what you've done with the word
[47:49] of
[47:50] God we see remember that when a prophet
[47:53] then is speaking and he'll say
[47:56] hey you wasn't saved on any
[48:01] day if you have eternal life that
[48:05] eternal life always was
[48:09] eternal that's
[48:12] simple but is it say see you won't agree
[48:14] with that I'm sure on the Internet won't
[48:16] agree with that but what else you going
[48:19] to say you can't argue the point if you
[48:21] say you always was eternal you don't
[48:23] need
[48:24] Jesus
[48:26] he didn't need to die for
[48:29] you all right but if you say you needed
[48:32] Jesus and you need to be born again
[48:34] you've annihilated the fact of believing
[48:35] that you always was
[48:40] eternal I'm sorry Church it rips my
[48:43] heart to pieces to think of the
[48:47] stupidity of human mankind and what we
[48:51] are taught and what we accept as
[48:54] truth
[48:56] yeah
[48:58] what maybe 100 years ago guy proved or
[49:01] something that if you rolled the ball 35
[49:03] mph down through that that gravity let
[49:06] loose and it just fly up and go up in
[49:08] the there you heard that then
[49:11] you now you run down
[49:14] to 2,000 M an hour in these cars and
[49:19] things you know the bigger things that
[49:22] are it still stays on the
[49:24] ground
[49:27] but you see that's what we
[49:29] do doctors used to bleed you a PT when
[49:31] you got sick
[49:34] right come
[49:37] on I don't want that
[49:40] now see we found out that the blood and
[49:43] it it was to let you bleed out some was
[49:46] great for some
[49:48] things because the blood reproduces I
[49:51] always enjoyed giving a a unit of blood
[49:53] there on Motors because first off I got
[49:56] off the line for an hour you know and I
[49:58] got to eat cookies and drink juices but
[50:00] second all it would make me feel better
[50:02] in a day or two why because my body's
[50:05] having to reproduce it well that was
[50:07] their
[50:09] thoughts but you get some poor old God
[50:11] that's so weak he can't stand it you
[50:13] know I mean it just it can't even move
[50:15] what do he do we need to bleed him
[50:18] aart I always wanted I know what I mean
[50:22] but I always thought about I'd like to
[50:23] grab the doctor and say okay doctor you
[50:26] Pine from you P from me you know but and
[50:29] it
[50:30] good but listen
[50:36] Church to come down to
[50:40] see God's word is eternal you remember
[50:45] the other day we trying to explain where
[50:47] Jesus said my words are spirit and their
[50:49] life all right but you know I can't say
[50:53] that you can't say that
[50:56] the best I can say is I will try to
[50:59] speak to you what God has revealed to me
[51:03] right that's the best I can do right and
[51:07] even in that I'll use wordings that are
[51:09] not spirit and life come
[51:13] on but see all them remember the other
[51:15] night I gave you all of God's word is
[51:24] deratization
[51:27] that and I make my words a part of it I
[51:31] made a hybrid out of
[51:33] it we know what hybrids
[51:36] are they take a big gr T of corn we said
[51:39] this morning a little popcorn and they
[51:41] pollinate it together in a things and
[51:43] they do it and what do you wind up with
[51:45] a beautiful good little ear of corn
[51:47] that's really
[51:49] tasty but once that's done you try to
[51:52] plant that the next year you're going to
[51:53] get a warped up naughty looking Sun
[51:55] something and did not the prophet say
[51:58] that that's what God does he says he
[51:59] doesn't have any
[52:03] grandchildren and he said every
[52:05] generation following gets
[52:07] worse is that
[52:09] true the further off the
[52:12] word cuz see they had that's what
[52:14] someone was asking me about it and I
[52:15] thought well surely we understand but
[52:18] you know I mean we do but you know they
[52:21] said well where do you get the the grain
[52:23] to go back and plant it again
[52:25] you got to go buy it from them cuz
[52:27] that's they pollinate it they they bring
[52:29] it down you know if you want to see some
[52:32] good pollinations come down house
[52:34] sometime I'll show you some corn that I
[52:36] planted Silver Queen and Golden
[52:39] Queen it's pretty it winds up high
[52:43] yellow and high white you
[52:45] know that's just from pollination right
[52:48] that ain't even for your you're doing
[52:50] but just remember a hybrid can't breed
[52:54] back you never thought like the brother
[52:56] R would say it like this he said where
[52:58] in the world or where in the time has
[53:00] there any Nation ever risen back to
[53:02] Power he said Israel is the only
[53:08] one right no nation has ever risen back
[53:12] to Power only Israel when you think
[53:15] about it show me one denomination that
[53:16] ever come
[53:21] back
[53:23] right not going to come back because
[53:25] they're
[53:28] hybrid now the people there are honest
[53:30] sincere people just like you and I not
[53:33] throwing off on anybody not not
[53:35] degrading
[53:36] anybody they haven't
[53:40] heard see you and I have heard
[53:43] amen and then what we do with what we
[53:45] heard Brother Don and I were talking
[53:47] about and he said he was speaking to to
[53:49] a guy and said the guy he was talking to
[53:50] him about water baptism or something and
[53:53] said the guy he seen it he just
[53:56] immediately seen he he knew that guy
[53:58] seen
[53:59] that he ain't seen the guy in a couple
[54:01] of
[54:02] years he ain't going to come back
[54:05] around but you know
[54:08] what he will answer at judgment for what
[54:12] was quickened unto
[54:16] him uh you don't agree with that
[54:19] huh well you tell me it's not
[54:23] right me and you out here arguing about
[54:25] it somebody hear us say this life at
[54:27] us but you let that be just touched into
[54:30] your heart just like that that's right
[54:33] you're going to answer for
[54:35] that somewhere so I'd rather get it out
[54:38] of here all right but think about
[54:41] it the same man that says it of saying
[54:45] you always was saved is the same man
[54:49] that we were covering this morning it
[54:50] says so if you have eternal
[54:54] life you were an attribute of God's
[54:57] thinking before there was anything but
[55:00] him what does that put you back
[55:06] there does that put you back
[55:09] there
[55:11] no it puts the thoughts of God of you
[55:14] and I right as being
[55:18] there come on he said he didn't believe
[55:20] in the Mormon Doctrine pre-existence
[55:22] reincarnation or transmigration of Souls
[55:25] all right you say well he did believe in
[55:28] a certain way of pre-existence
[55:30] but uh I believe in pre-existence I
[55:33] believe in pre-existence of eternal life
[55:36] don't
[55:37] you I believe God is eternal and always
[55:40] was
[55:41] eternal and I believe if I have that
[55:43] life in me then that life that's in me
[55:46] always was eternal right that's
[55:50] right I don't need a new birth after
[55:52] getting a new birth I need a lot of
[55:55] being born again grows in Grace and
[55:57] knowledge right but not another New
[56:00] Birth one birth many
[56:04] feelings so if we were in his thinking
[56:07] at the
[56:08] beginning if you got eternal life
[56:11] there's only one form of eternal life
[56:13] eternal life had no beginning and no
[56:15] ending so if you have eternal life you
[56:17] were an attribute of God sing before
[56:20] there was anything but
[56:23] him amen
[56:26] I believe
[56:28] that I believe the eternal life that I
[56:30] have always was
[56:33] eternal but I believe there was a time I
[56:35] had to receive
[56:39] it now there's your pro and con as I
[56:42] said if you believe you didn't need to
[56:44] receive it then you don't need Jesus
[56:47] that's
[56:50] right I'm sorry for being like that but
[56:54] you know what you might find out one of
[56:56] these days God told me to say that
[56:58] that's your business not mine cuz I
[57:00] don't have to worry about it cuz I
[57:01] believe it's the truth whether he said
[57:03] it or I said it or you say it or a
[57:06] donkey says it I believe it's a
[57:09] truth if you had something you don't
[57:11] need something but if you admit you
[57:13] didn't have it until he come and
[57:17] died that's right then he would be
[57:19] saying to Nicodemus Nicodemus what you
[57:21] need to do is believe right
[57:26] believe what Nicodemus had already
[57:28] confessed he said we know you're a man
[57:29] sent from God nobody can do the things
[57:31] that you're doing except God be with him
[57:34] he already publicly conf or Jesus
[57:37] confessed
[57:39] that but he said you must be born again
[57:41] he said I don't understand
[57:43] you why because he was speaking in a
[57:45] Heavenly
[57:48] term
[57:50] right he said if you have eternal life
[57:53] you always was
[57:55] not your being here that's who is this
[57:57] Mel jezdic that's where we're at this
[58:00] morning not your being here not not
[58:03] anything you're looking at or any
[58:05] part the only thing that you're looking
[58:07] at it can be Eternal is the soul anyway
[58:10] the body and fear is not
[58:14] Eternal but you explain to me now and
[58:17] I'm just as sincere and and weeping in
[58:20] my heart to say it but you show me every
[58:22] Doctrine that's ever been and I'll show
[58:24] show you that it always leads
[58:26] into adulterous sa
[58:34] fire I don't mind
[58:37] that cuz you see I know one thing for
[58:41] sure if I don't have it lined up
[58:44] straight I'm headed that
[58:48] way I never heard a preacher talk like
[58:50] you you probably never will you'll never
[58:53] hear one being as honest and sincere as
[58:55] I try to be with you because if I have
[58:57] my own ideas and thoughts put with this
[58:59] message I'm going right into a bed of
[59:02] adulter sometime physically let alone
[59:05] the spiritual part I'm already
[59:09] in I don't no you say you shouldn't talk
[59:12] that away
[59:14] why brother B said if you have eternal
[59:17] life today you are in God by God's being
[59:21] in you that's right that's it
[59:25] God bringing his own life into you and I
[59:27] gives us eternal
[59:31] life see then why can't we speak as the
[59:35] Bible speaks come on why can't we speak
[59:38] as the prophet speak why can't we speak
[59:40] in present tense yes sir
[59:44] amen I'm already
[59:51] raptured oh now wait a minute that's a
[59:54] little bit too much future now that
[59:55] that's just a little bit beyond what I
[59:59] think well if you're sitting there sick
[1:00:01] and you say by Stripes I'm Healed
[1:00:04] right is that a future tense or present
[1:00:06] tense which one is
[1:00:08] it future tense won't get you healed p t
[1:00:11] won't do it well all of them back there
[1:00:14] got it and all them out you are going to
[1:00:17] get it no no bring it down to where you
[1:00:19] at that's right yes
[1:00:23] sir bring your salvation you got to
[1:00:26] confess it according to the
[1:00:28] scripture with the mouth confession is
[1:00:30] made with the heart man believeth is
[1:00:33] that the Bible right all right see then
[1:00:36] what are we
[1:00:38] doing but we take our thoughts and their
[1:00:41] ideas and just make it what we think
[1:00:44] it's supposed to
[1:00:47] be and we ended up on
[1:00:50] the talking
[1:00:52] of how brother randam which speak a lot
[1:00:55] of times about the little woman at the
[1:00:57] wh he said there she was and all of that
[1:01:01] but said she was a predestinated
[1:01:05] seed and said down in her l a
[1:01:08] predestinated seed and as quick as he
[1:01:11] spoke to her she said you know we're
[1:01:14] looking for a m he said I'm he she throw
[1:01:18] the water po down she run into the city
[1:01:19] she does all the thing he said see there
[1:01:22] said that predestinated seed come alive
[1:01:28] all I ask you did that give you did that
[1:01:30] give her eternal
[1:01:34] life if that gave her eternal life then
[1:01:37] when Jesus died he died in
[1:01:40] vain come on you got one you got the
[1:01:43] other you going to have to take one side
[1:01:44] of the other women today there's no in
[1:01:47] between on this thing that's right
[1:01:50] you're either going to go with it this
[1:01:51] way or you're going to go with it that
[1:01:52] way it's got to be made today
[1:01:55] why because somebody's telling you it's
[1:01:57] got to be
[1:02:01] made if that little woman received
[1:02:03] eternal
[1:02:06] life and Jesus Christ died in
[1:02:12] vain but we got to admit because the
[1:02:15] prophet said
[1:02:16] it that that word that predestinated
[1:02:19] seed Was Made Alive all right
[1:02:23] right I believe
[1:02:26] that cuz I believe that as I saying to
[1:02:29] start with anybody in the world today
[1:02:32] can believe God and God will heal
[1:02:37] them the prophet said if God heal
[1:02:40] one anybody else meets that condition
[1:02:43] they got to be healed right all right
[1:02:47] would that mean they're
[1:02:51] saved doesn't mean it does
[1:02:55] so if we is it possible Brother D to get
[1:02:58] a revelation Peter got one that's right
[1:03:01] he said D the Christ the son of the
[1:03:03] Living
[1:03:05] God lied and cussed over there denying
[1:03:09] the Lord Jesus and you tell me he had a
[1:03:12] new birth I I'm I'm literally going to
[1:03:14] laugh up my sleeve at
[1:03:16] you thinking you're that dumb well
[1:03:19] brother Dale now we've all done you tell
[1:03:22] me come on I quote pretty good you know
[1:03:25] you show me where the Prophet ever said
[1:03:28] that you with the Holy Ghost can go out
[1:03:30] and turn the word
[1:03:32] down I want to see
[1:03:35] it sure we got problems we're human
[1:03:37] beings we're living but we're not going
[1:03:39] to turn the word down that's
[1:03:42] right you're going to deny Jesus Christ
[1:03:44] as your savior then I'm going to tell
[1:03:47] you you don't have him that's right
[1:03:49] might as well go ahead and deny
[1:03:51] it but if you have it they can't take it
[1:03:53] out of you they ain't going to deprogram
[1:03:55] no Christian
[1:04:00] right he said it cleaned the Blackness
[1:04:03] out of that little woman at the way and
[1:04:05] made everything
[1:04:10] white he said there was a seed laying
[1:04:13] there a predestinated seed that was in
[1:04:16] it was God's
[1:04:18] thoughts before the foundation of the
[1:04:23] world
[1:04:25] now think about
[1:04:27] it now here's what we're going to get to
[1:04:29] and we'll try to finish up this part of
[1:04:31] the
[1:04:35] message I like to repeat
[1:04:39] things sometimes you asleep sometimes
[1:04:42] you're playing with a kid sometimes
[1:04:43] you're looking sometimes you're doing if
[1:04:46] I went by everybody's looks I would be
[1:04:49] vastly confused about what's going
[1:04:51] on now remember kids I me adults excuse
[1:04:57] me remember adults were not
[1:05:02] kids kids can sit in a
[1:05:05] group and you can be talking around them
[1:05:08] and they'll remember what you
[1:05:10] said
[1:05:13] right you better be careful what you say
[1:05:15] in front of you kids you remember in the
[1:05:17] Bible the 42 of them that was ate up by
[1:05:19] the sheers because they were out there
[1:05:21] saying go up old
[1:05:23] ballhead that was Mom and Daddy sitting
[1:05:25] over at home said that old baldheaded
[1:05:28] guy thinks he's something why don't he
[1:05:30] just go on
[1:05:31] up said he said he's following Elijah
[1:05:34] said go on up which one
[1:05:38] you you better be careful what you say
[1:05:40] them
[1:05:41] kids right they going to get you in
[1:05:45] trouble but remember now adults
[1:05:48] joy we don't remember that good do
[1:05:53] we
[1:05:56] we were starting to go to Jeffersonville
[1:05:59] I think it was brother mol us one time
[1:06:01] the women wouldn't go but anyhow they
[1:06:03] were sitting at the house there and
[1:06:05] brother Mo walked in there and he
[1:06:07] said if all of y'all talk at the same
[1:06:09] time when we G said you get a lot
[1:06:14] said his point was it ain't going to
[1:06:16] matter anyway cuz he wasn't going to
[1:06:17] remember it all of you sisters sat down
[1:06:19] a while ago and talk for an hour and a
[1:06:21] half you remember what she talked about
[1:06:26] some but not
[1:06:30] all worst part of those you remember the
[1:06:34] bad right okay get on
[1:06:37] it but I'm asking a simple
[1:06:42] question and I believe what the Bible
[1:06:45] says and I believe what the prophet
[1:06:50] says and I believe that by God's forn
[1:06:53] knowledge
[1:06:55] for knowledge remember we went through
[1:06:57] week after week after week of for
[1:07:00] knowledge that he could predestinate
[1:07:03] that's according to Paul in
[1:07:05] Romans that he would predestinate by his
[1:07:08] for
[1:07:09] knowledge all right right then I believe
[1:07:13] that and I believe
[1:07:16] that by his for knowledge he knew
[1:07:19] whether or not you and I would be saved
[1:07:22] that's right amen I believe that he
[1:07:25] believed that he he knew that before the
[1:07:28] world this is not a play game with him
[1:07:31] right all right but did he predestinate
[1:07:36] as we've all
[1:07:37] said which means
[1:07:40] predetermined or did he do it by his
[1:07:42] full
[1:07:45] knowledge if he done it by his own point
[1:07:48] and you're making him wrong
[1:07:49] because the prophet said he doesn't
[1:07:52] predestinate by his desires that's right
[1:07:55] when he predestines by his for knowledge
[1:07:57] CU he desired that everybody be saved
[1:08:00] right God desired everybody in the world
[1:08:02] to be saved but he knew everybody was
[1:08:04] not going to be
[1:08:05] saved
[1:08:07] right so he could write names in The
[1:08:09] Book of Life before the foundation of
[1:08:11] the
[1:08:12] world you you say we sing that song
[1:08:15] there's a new name written down in
[1:08:16] heaven sounds pretty but ain't no
[1:08:18] Revelation to it there ain't no new name
[1:08:20] written down in heaven it either wrote
[1:08:22] down before the world or never be
[1:08:23] written
[1:08:25] there
[1:08:26] right this is not a play game or
[1:08:29] something we thought well I've always
[1:08:30] been taught this I been T that well if
[1:08:34] this and that don't fit this the Bible
[1:08:37] then where are we at that's right we
[1:08:40] need to get rid of this and that and
[1:08:43] settle down to God's word all
[1:08:47] right so I firmly
[1:08:52] believe
[1:08:54] may I quote
[1:08:57] this that every person that comes into
[1:09:00] the
[1:09:02] world is a child of God by creation
[1:09:08] right that's right and you going to tell
[1:09:10] me the devil brought some I'm going tell
[1:09:12] you fo with
[1:09:16] you only God is the creator Satan can't
[1:09:19] create he
[1:09:20] perverts there is no children of the
[1:09:22] devil that the devil brought into the
[1:09:25] world he perverts us once we come into
[1:09:27] the world Amen all right then if every
[1:09:32] child every person is a child of God by
[1:09:36] creation and he says in Ezekiel 18:4 he
[1:09:39] said All Souls are
[1:09:41] mine all
[1:09:43] right then if that be true and we
[1:09:46] believe
[1:09:48] it then where is the problem
[1:09:51] with understanding that God God by full
[1:09:55] knowledge could look down through the
[1:09:57] world and see every
[1:10:01] person that would come into the world
[1:10:03] you believe he could do
[1:10:05] that if you don't what kind of a God you
[1:10:09] got he's not
[1:10:11] infinite if he couldn't look down and
[1:10:13] see every
[1:10:14] person all right now if he could look
[1:10:17] down and see of a person then why
[1:10:20] couldn't he look down to see what we
[1:10:22] desired
[1:10:27] but see we're so spiritually re relev
[1:10:31] you know my brother Dale you don't
[1:10:33] understand nobody sought God Amen the
[1:10:36] Bible
[1:10:38] says the Bible says that but you mean
[1:10:42] you didn't seek
[1:10:43] God is that annihilating the fact that
[1:10:46] you prayed and cried before God to
[1:10:48] receive
[1:10:50] him now what's it saying no no man
[1:10:53] sought God it's exactly right we wern't
[1:10:57] made to be seeking
[1:10:59] him but he come down in contacted us and
[1:11:02] that changed the situation right all he
[1:11:06] had to do was just pass by us that was
[1:11:11] it so it was God seeking you and I but
[1:11:14] what did he
[1:11:17] use he use life he use things to bring
[1:11:22] you and I to a place
[1:11:26] that we would want
[1:11:27] him because he can't override your free
[1:11:29] moral agency
[1:11:31] right he can't save you when you don't
[1:11:33] want to be
[1:11:37] saved so then I believe firmly that
[1:11:40] before the
[1:11:42] world if I have eternal life
[1:11:45] today that eternal life was part of
[1:11:50] God's life that's right and he knew that
[1:11:53] I want
[1:11:54] it so he'd have it for me am he had it
[1:11:58] for everybody else but they don't want
[1:12:01] it can the thing form say why did you
[1:12:04] form me so is that
[1:12:06] Paul he didn't form us
[1:12:10] wrong
[1:12:12] right but now
[1:12:18] listen so then I can believe that before
[1:12:21] the
[1:12:22] world you remember a few months ago six
[1:12:26] or
[1:12:27] maybe when I was preaching on when the
[1:12:30] morning Stars sang together and the sons
[1:12:32] of God shouted for
[1:12:35] Joy you remember what I preached on
[1:12:40] that what did I preach on that that that
[1:12:44] that was before the world in God's mind
[1:12:46] that's right but that he was looking
[1:12:48] down to where we are
[1:12:50] now
[1:12:52] right we wasn't people up in heaven
[1:12:55] running around
[1:12:57] shouting you're getting into
[1:13:06] pre-existence now come on if you don't
[1:13:08] believe that then I want you to answer
[1:13:09] me one
[1:13:11] question if we was back there shouting
[1:13:14] screaming and hollering I thought the
[1:13:17] prophet said it was because of Salvation
[1:13:21] well now where was anybody back there
[1:13:23] that needed
[1:13:26] saving come
[1:13:28] on I just try to make things carnal
[1:13:31] enough for us to understand it was there
[1:13:33] anybody back there that was
[1:13:37] saved you know was there great big
[1:13:39] meeting going on and everybody getting
[1:13:41] saved nother would nobody lost that's
[1:13:45] right is that
[1:13:48] sensible so it wasn't nobody
[1:13:51] lost why would it be shouting about
[1:13:58] salvation but we're down here shouting
[1:14:01] about it
[1:14:03] right and he was back there looking down
[1:14:06] here seeing us shouting about our
[1:14:10] Salvation all
[1:14:13] right because remember we'll get to it
[1:14:16] in a minute and I'll back up on it when
[1:14:19] he said Jesus Christ stood as a lamb
[1:14:20] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:14:23] just
[1:14:25] remember in God's mind that was a
[1:14:30] reality you go with
[1:14:32] me but in reality that was not a
[1:14:36] reality if it is why they have to
[1:14:41] die why didn't he just walk down here
[1:14:43] and say I died for the world I see y'all
[1:14:45] back up into
[1:14:50] heaven
[1:14:52] no what he saw in his mind before the
[1:14:54] world one day transmitted to an Earthly
[1:14:59] situation now if I'm wrong there I want
[1:15:02] you to explain something to
[1:15:04] me if I'm wrong that that you know he
[1:15:09] died before the
[1:15:11] world physically you know some
[1:15:15] way then you realize that when they
[1:15:19] offered the first
[1:15:22] lamb that would be making Jesus Christ
[1:15:24] false
[1:15:30] prophecy maybe you don't see what I see
[1:15:35] there but if you offered one lamb and
[1:15:39] that being real back there then you're
[1:15:41] saying it that's not
[1:15:45] real amen come on I like to get down to
[1:15:49] talk to you and let you
[1:15:52] think
[1:15:54] but just remember I know and realize
[1:15:56] that most people are not even hearing
[1:15:58] what I'm saying because they're
[1:16:06] thinking right they're figuring out what
[1:16:09] I'm talking about where I'm going what
[1:16:10] I'm doing and I invite you to not do
[1:16:13] that just stay with me you might get
[1:16:16] trapped out on the limb somewhere so the
[1:16:18] best thing to do you stay with me and
[1:16:22] listen
[1:16:23] right if Jesus Christ stood literally
[1:16:26] before the
[1:16:28] world why did they offer the blood of
[1:16:30] bulls and
[1:16:36] goats no they had to offer them cuz God
[1:16:40] offered
[1:16:41] it to speak of Jesus Christ that would
[1:16:44] come and die right if he hadn't died we
[1:16:48] couldn't have eternal life that's
[1:16:52] right right
[1:16:54] right see then where our minds goes out
[1:16:57] so much and we run it off sounds
[1:17:00] beautiful but what good is
[1:17:08] it we were healed before the foundation
[1:17:11] world but why are we still
[1:17:15] sick same time is the lamb slain he
[1:17:17] healed us right the same time the lamb
[1:17:20] was slain he saved usen yeah that's
[1:17:26] right no we say but but brother that
[1:17:29] always was then you always was healed
[1:17:31] don't go to no more
[1:17:33] doctors don't tell me you're sick cuz
[1:17:37] you always was
[1:17:40] healed you see it don't
[1:17:43] work we think we've got it all figured
[1:17:48] out I know somebody like me comes along
[1:17:50] is hateful arrogant old dude that don't
[1:17:53] mind just telling you you don't know
[1:17:55] where you're
[1:17:56] at you know why because until God
[1:18:00] revealed it I didn't know where I was at
[1:18:02] I was just like you and
[1:18:05] everybody we're all in Mass
[1:18:08] confusion I'm just trying my best to
[1:18:10] save you out of that confusion but have
[1:18:13] I become your enemy because I tell you
[1:18:15] the
[1:18:21] truth now that's
[1:18:24] something you mean I tell you the truth
[1:18:26] trying to save your
[1:18:28] life a lot of you know it some of you
[1:18:30] were sitting there in a ministers
[1:18:33] meeting we had one time and this one
[1:18:35] brother got up and he started talking
[1:18:37] about that I'm not going to tell you
[1:18:40] what I believe I going tell you what
[1:18:41] somebody else believes you know how that
[1:18:43] is and he started talking about that
[1:18:45] it's okay to have more than one
[1:18:48] wife cuz the chickens has got it the
[1:18:51] cows has got it
[1:18:53] the deer got it why can't we got
[1:18:57] it
[1:19:01] well I was asked to speak after the
[1:19:04] brother said
[1:19:06] that and the first thing I said
[1:19:10] was why in the world would any idiot
[1:19:13] want more than one
[1:19:20] wife you only got two troubles and two
[1:19:28] mother-in-laws
[1:19:32] right you know what that man wouldn't
[1:19:34] speak to me for about 5
[1:19:38] years I mean I dug that church out
[1:19:42] of polygamy because they were already
[1:19:45] and I'm not lying to you say I'm telling
[1:19:48] you and sorry that I have to tell you
[1:19:49] they had already planned who was going
[1:19:51] home with who
[1:19:53] they had already picked out in the
[1:19:54] church who was going home with
[1:19:58] who we'll meet at judgment if you don't
[1:20:01] believe that's
[1:20:03] true and I dug that church out of
[1:20:06] polygamy the whole church was in
[1:20:11] it but I become an
[1:20:14] enemy until 5 years later I called a man
[1:20:17] to just try to talk to him and his wife
[1:20:20] called and I could hear her on the phone
[1:20:23] and she
[1:20:24] said called his name and said brother
[1:20:27] Dale wants you on the phone he said
[1:20:29] brother
[1:20:32] who come on who is
[1:20:35] this I said brother Dale down here in
[1:20:37] Georgia you know he used to be friends
[1:20:40] you
[1:20:44] know you see
[1:20:47] church we think we got it figured
[1:20:51] out but we better live
[1:20:53] listen because our life is at stake yes
[1:20:57] sir we talk about a Rapture how can it
[1:21:01] be a
[1:21:02] Rapture without a revealing of the word
[1:21:04] of God that's right and you show me that
[1:21:08] anywhere but you see I believe brother R
[1:21:11] say we come here with a seat in you I'd
[1:21:13] say Amen
[1:21:17] right but now all I want to know
[1:21:20] is when was it put there
[1:21:25] right well what do you mean i' b in the
[1:21:28] world with it and wouldn't what the
[1:21:30] prophet said
[1:21:32] right when was it put there where was it
[1:21:39] put and if I need it how can I get
[1:21:43] it brother Al and brother Fred and
[1:21:47] brother collie and him brother dick nut
[1:21:49] was riding with a certain brother and he
[1:21:52] come kind of believed in that old two
[1:21:54] Soul Doctrine and we left Hendersonville
[1:21:57] North Carolina no excuse me we left
[1:21:59] Tennessee coming to
[1:22:01] Hendersonville and uh the time we got
[1:22:03] down there the brother was glad to get
[1:22:04] out of the vehicle with us and I was
[1:22:07] saying boys let off cuz they were
[1:22:10] ripping him to
[1:22:11] pieces and asking him questions that he
[1:22:13] had no way to
[1:22:15] answer like where was the
[1:22:18] seed where was the seed of God put
[1:22:21] before the world
[1:22:23] and when you come in the world where was
[1:22:25] it
[1:22:32] put but you see if we take the truth of
[1:22:34] it we can see what it is let's start now
[1:22:36] I'll try to read real fast okay go ahead
[1:22:39] we start with number 10 works of Faith
[1:22:41] Express
[1:22:42] 19651
[1:22:46] 206 now here predestinated plan is in
[1:22:50] plain view just as other seed the word
[1:22:53] of God is a seed and must have the
[1:22:54] ground prepared beforehand if you sewed
[1:22:57] seed just throwed it out there on the
[1:22:58] ground it would do no good the birds
[1:23:00] would pick it up you throw it among
[1:23:02] tickles and Thorns it choke it out
[1:23:04] pretty soon Jesus's Parable said so the
[1:23:07] ground had to be made ready first that's
[1:23:10] what the preaching is for right the
[1:23:12] preaching is for making the ground ready
[1:23:14] for you to receive what God is saying
[1:23:16] okay so God in Sovereign Grace prepares
[1:23:19] the heart first he prepared you before
[1:23:23] the foundation of the
[1:23:25] world to receive him in this
[1:23:31] age that's simple isn't
[1:23:34] it he fornew You by his forn knowledge
[1:23:37] and ordained you to eternal life he knew
[1:23:40] you therefore he prepared you amen
[1:23:44] when before the
[1:23:48] world
[1:23:49] right look at the next one
[1:23:53] this is trying to do God a service
[1:23:54] without his will and all of these will
[1:23:56] basically be after 6 63 seals
[1:24:00] opening roll it on down to where we got
[1:24:02] this the statements because you read all
[1:24:04] the other and see if it don't work I
[1:24:06] give them to
[1:24:07] you look or back up brother ours they're
[1:24:10] saying to brother randam and said we
[1:24:12] know how Billy Graham can do this we
[1:24:13] know how Rob but how in the world can
[1:24:15] you do this who do you think going to
[1:24:16] believe it in other
[1:24:18] words he said it's
[1:24:20] God I the Lord has planted it before the
[1:24:23] foundation of the
[1:24:26] world I'll Water it day and night unless
[1:24:30] some of them should pluck it from my
[1:24:31] hand Isaiah I water it I planted it I
[1:24:34] put their names on the book before the
[1:24:36] foundation of the world by
[1:24:38] predestination I'll Water it just keep
[1:24:41] on moving I'll furnish the water you
[1:24:43] just spray it out right I'll Water it
[1:24:46] day and night L one of them gets plucked
[1:24:48] out of my hand going to the
[1:24:51] next
[1:24:56] the message taking sides with Jesus
[1:24:58] 1962 look what he
[1:25:06] says yeah
[1:25:08] 243 244 walked up there and Jesus said
[1:25:11] behold an Israelite in whom there's no G
[1:25:15] he said Rabbi when did you know me who's
[1:25:18] that talking
[1:25:20] about what
[1:25:23] he said before Philip called you when
[1:25:25] you were under the tree I saw
[1:25:28] you what did the water struck that
[1:25:31] predestinated
[1:25:33] seed
[1:25:35] right oh my when it did he said Rabbi
[1:25:39] thou the Son of God you're the king of
[1:25:40] Israel what was it the seed was laying
[1:25:42] there
[1:25:43] ready God SED it back under before the
[1:25:46] foundation of the world that it should
[1:25:49] bring forth the light right at that time
[1:25:55] but did it give him a new
[1:25:56] birth look at the
[1:26:00] next why could I speak 1963 7:14 the
[1:26:03] morning service I esteem that so highly
[1:26:05] because God in his Mercy before the
[1:26:08] foundation of the world world saw me and
[1:26:10] placed a little seed in
[1:26:15] there that my faith would fly above
[1:26:18] these things of the world and now he's
[1:26:20] called me to it
[1:26:22] I regard my
[1:26:25] place look the
[1:26:27] next Christ is the mystery of God
[1:26:33] revealed paragraph
[1:26:37] 467 you can you can't commit adultery
[1:26:41] you're already pregnated Glory he's
[1:26:44] talking about the new birth of what
[1:26:45] you're doing you're prisoner to
[1:26:47] Christ he can't take a hold the wound of
[1:26:50] life is closed to anything else
[1:26:52] you're already his by
[1:26:55] predestination that seed has come to
[1:26:57] life no world can get in
[1:27:00] oh how we'd like to stay on this about
[1:27:03] an hour I'm sure understand Christ and
[1:27:06] his alone already finished the seed was
[1:27:08] there the seed was already when was it
[1:27:12] put there now read the
[1:27:17] question the question was when was the
[1:27:19] seed put there he asked the question and
[1:27:22] when was the seed put there before the
[1:27:24] foundation of the world has
[1:27:26] predestinated us unto eternal life and
[1:27:30] as soon as the lifegiving flow that seed
[1:27:32] laying there other seeds that just would
[1:27:35] come in wouldn't take hold just quickly
[1:27:39] it stopped up the wound all the rest of
[1:27:41] the seed was drove
[1:27:43] out okay when was it put
[1:27:47] there before the foundation of the
[1:27:51] world
[1:27:53] go the letter I want to get these
[1:27:54] through and then I'll I'll stop and
[1:27:56] preach for a second go to number 15
[1:27:58] which is why Christ
[1:28:01] speak paragraph
[1:28:03] 38 see the seed of God is actually
[1:28:06] placed in us from the foundation of the
[1:28:07] world and when the light first strikes
[1:28:09] that seed it brings it to life but the
[1:28:11] light first has to come upon the seed
[1:28:15] okay seed not a with a Shu 1965
[1:28:20] 429 number 16
[1:28:24] God knew before the foundation world who
[1:28:26] would be saved and who would not be
[1:28:27] saved by predestination by for knowledge
[1:28:31] he saw every
[1:28:32] member put every name on The lon's Book
[1:28:35] of Life before the church ever
[1:28:40] began and when was it what is he saying
[1:28:42] all these things were okay next one 17
[1:28:47] questions and answers
[1:28:49] 1959 628
[1:28:52] were we Spirits then he's asking the
[1:28:55] question the back before the world see
[1:28:58] no we were not even nothing then but in
[1:29:00] God's mind we were and he spoke it and
[1:29:03] it materialized Jesus was slain before
[1:29:06] how many knows that the Bible teaches
[1:29:08] that Jesus Christ was SL was a lamb of
[1:29:10] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:29:12] why God spoke it and when he spoke it it
[1:29:14] was as good as finished there's your
[1:29:17] prophets and all the people saying the
[1:29:18] thing
[1:29:19] right and when he saw me he saw you
[1:29:22] before the foundation world we were only
[1:29:24] figurative in his mind
[1:29:27] right then when we come to the world we
[1:29:30] were both male he's talking about then
[1:29:31] he coming down to Adam and a different
[1:29:33] thing all
[1:29:37] right think about
[1:29:48] it look at the next one then we'll just
[1:29:50] stop
[1:29:54] this is number 17 number
[1:29:57] 18 taken from when their eyes were open
[1:29:59] they knew
[1:30:01] him he is the Eternal one and when these
[1:30:03] things that's happening now are only the
[1:30:06] attributes of God's
[1:30:08] thinking at first it has to be a thought
[1:30:12] now you remember the other day when we
[1:30:13] were bringing first God
[1:30:16] thought then he spoke it becomes a word
[1:30:21] right
[1:30:22] he thought of a world he spoke a
[1:30:25] world
[1:30:28] right see he thought it and he spoke it
[1:30:30] that's simple isn't it it first it has
[1:30:33] to be a thought and then a word and a
[1:30:35] word when a thought expressed is a word
[1:30:38] and then it's spoken it has to happen
[1:30:40] and the whole thing is God unfolding
[1:30:42] himself in his attributes and then God
[1:30:44] being made material tangible that we can
[1:30:47] talk to speak with in his whole church
[1:30:50] body and everything Therefore your name
[1:30:53] was in his
[1:30:55] thinking that's how you have eternal
[1:30:59] life now was you reading
[1:31:02] that Therefore your name was in his
[1:31:06] thinking that's how you have eternal
[1:31:09] life because you were in this thinking
[1:31:12] you can't have it no other
[1:31:16] way if you got eternal life you always
[1:31:20] was you if otherwise you just can't say
[1:31:23] well I belong to church I do this no
[1:31:25] eternal life never had a anything that
[1:31:27] has Eternal never did begin and cannot
[1:31:30] end so you were only in his thinking
[1:31:32] your name who you are and what you are
[1:31:35] that's the only way you could ever have
[1:31:37] eternal life cuz you always
[1:31:40] was got some more in there but I'll
[1:31:43] stop because I want to point to
[1:31:47] you when was the seed put there before
[1:31:49] the foundation of the world amen right
[1:31:53] all right I ask you questions were we
[1:31:55] back
[1:32:00] there simple terminologies you know what
[1:32:03] a lot of you sitting here thinking today
[1:32:06] you're thinking that some of these is
[1:32:07] just come in ain't
[1:32:12] understanding they might understand more
[1:32:14] than you do because they ain't all
[1:32:16] theology
[1:32:18] minded they're
[1:32:20] listening
[1:32:23] but you think you got it all figured
[1:32:25] out and you think brother Dale is just
[1:32:27] too deep what's it any depth to what
[1:32:30] I've said
[1:32:32] today if we believe in Eternal God if we
[1:32:35] believe God is real if we believe that
[1:32:37] he is infinite then before the world
[1:32:40] ever begun ever a thought of the world
[1:32:43] ever come into existence molecules atoms
[1:32:45] or
[1:32:48] anything he dwelt alone with his
[1:32:51] thoughts that's
[1:32:52] right CU that's the best word they can
[1:32:54] use to call him Elohim Elohim means
[1:32:57] self-existing so he existed alone with
[1:33:00] his thoughts were we back to there
[1:33:03] no were we
[1:33:05] Spirits were we morning stars singing
[1:33:08] together sons of God shouting for
[1:33:10] Joy
[1:33:15] No did Jesus Christ literally
[1:33:18] die
[1:33:20] no not back before the
[1:33:25] world was your name put in the Lou book
[1:33:28] of life before the foundation of
[1:33:31] world you see there's some other things
[1:33:33] your Prophet has
[1:33:35] said that people don't want to talk
[1:33:39] about there is no writing of new
[1:33:43] names but what about where he says it
[1:33:45] your name goes on the book as a Believer
[1:33:48] at
[1:33:49] sanctification that's right
[1:33:52] you see I've been preaching 40 something
[1:33:54] years folks not 30
[1:33:59] minutes I know a lot of the quotes that
[1:34:01] he made and they'll all fit together as
[1:34:04] a beautiful
[1:34:06] glove he didn't write down a name when
[1:34:08] you got saved at the altar already for
[1:34:11] the world but you had to come to that
[1:34:13] altar that's right that's right he said
[1:34:16] you receive eternal life right here at
[1:34:17] the
[1:34:19] altar right but see if there is is a God
[1:34:22] and that God is
[1:34:24] real then in his thinking before the
[1:34:27] world this whole world went by and he
[1:34:31] saw it
[1:34:32] all right he saw every day and every
[1:34:35] person and every thing whatever
[1:34:39] happen and he was still in his mind were
[1:34:43] we Spirits
[1:34:45] no were we people running around back
[1:34:50] no
[1:34:53] Jesus Christ never physically
[1:34:56] died before the world that's right if he
[1:34:59] did you blood of bulls and goats would
[1:35:00] be annihilating
[1:35:02] it you don't realize what that just said
[1:35:09] but some people ought have enough sense
[1:35:11] to see what I just
[1:35:13] said if Jesus Christ physically died out
[1:35:16] there before the world then when you
[1:35:17] offered that blood of bulls and goat
[1:35:19] you're denying he died that's right
[1:35:21] whether you like it or not whether you
[1:35:24] admit you're doing that oh no Brother D
[1:35:26] I'm not saying that well what are you
[1:35:30] saying in God's mind he died before the
[1:35:34] world Amen that's right he could speak
[1:35:36] it in the Bible and speak it was already
[1:35:41] finished he could speak of rapture is
[1:35:43] already finished he could speak a future
[1:35:46] home a millennium of the things that in
[1:35:50] his Bible it hasn't even come into
[1:35:52] existence
[1:35:54] yet but he could speak it as already
[1:35:56] been done that's right and when a
[1:35:59] prophet speaks like that he does that's
[1:36:01] the way your Prophet speaks turn any
[1:36:04] tape on going home
[1:36:05] today and notice in there if he ain't
[1:36:08] talking
[1:36:10] positive just like it's
[1:36:12] there that's right and that's where man
[1:36:16] gets confused they try to figure him out
[1:36:19] and he'll say just a few days ago I was
[1:36:21] it so and so and they run it back so
[1:36:23] well that was 10
[1:36:30] years but listen
[1:36:34] church we were in God's
[1:36:38] mind before the world right now we're
[1:36:42] going to get to it next probably no I
[1:36:45] doubt it got one
[1:36:46] more but the prophet said the person
[1:36:48] didn't come predestinated eternally from
[1:36:51] God
[1:36:53] God he said it was the word of seed
[1:36:56] that's right yes sir that comes
[1:36:57] predestinated eternally not the person
[1:37:01] so why don't we get the person out of it
[1:37:03] and then you won't have people run off
[1:37:04] in adultery you know if you get this
[1:37:07] person out here out of how in the world
[1:37:08] can you have any of those
[1:37:13] things would you see when was the seed
[1:37:16] put there in God's mind before the
[1:37:20] world he saw you saw you'd want to be
[1:37:23] saved he put it there
[1:37:26] then wrote your name in the book as far
[1:37:29] as he's concerned the whole thing's
[1:37:32] finished but that didn't make it
[1:37:35] finished for you and
[1:37:39] I as I said while ago whether you like
[1:37:43] it or not you think I always was eternal
[1:37:45] I take that I don't need Jesus but then
[1:37:48] the other people that are gone his
[1:37:49] hearted people that will come over and
[1:37:51] say say I really need
[1:37:53] him and you're denying that you always
[1:37:59] was you see church it was not some
[1:38:01] physical happening did God put a seed in
[1:38:04] you what kind of a seed did he put in
[1:38:07] you what kind of a seed did he put in
[1:38:09] you a word when his word is his seed did
[1:38:13] he put John 3:16 in you brother Callie
[1:38:15] in Acts 238 and you brother brother
[1:38:17] Addison
[1:38:20] and
[1:38:22] is that what he put
[1:38:26] in no no he he he he just put a spot a
[1:38:30] spot of
[1:38:35] what you have a spot of eternal life a
[1:38:38] spot of eternal life is eternal
[1:38:41] life yes
[1:38:43] sir you don't have
[1:38:45] spots you either got it or don't have
[1:38:48] it right
[1:38:54] going take it up
[1:38:56] Wednesday you can't have a black white
[1:39:02] bird you're either a sinner or a
[1:39:06] saint
[1:39:07] amen that's
[1:39:11] right God won't dwell in an unclean
[1:39:17] vessel then you want to put him
[1:39:19] somewhere in you
[1:39:24] right come on well it's in your soul cuz
[1:39:27] they got the in apartment they found out
[1:39:29] now the so oh
[1:39:31] boy you mean God's an inch square
[1:39:36] compartment we've done been through that
[1:39:38] that your soul is your being of who you
[1:39:41] are and looks just like
[1:39:46] you well I've always been taught well
[1:39:49] it's about time maybe to think about
[1:39:51] what you've been
[1:39:54] taught why don't you just sit down
[1:39:57] sometimes and analyze what you've been
[1:40:02] taught when I was in the Baptist I was
[1:40:04] taught there was three
[1:40:06] Gods what about the rest of
[1:40:10] you well I never did believe that well
[1:40:13] why did you tell me you did when I talk
[1:40:15] to
[1:40:17] you come
[1:40:19] on
[1:40:23] but you see we don't want to admit we're
[1:40:28] wrong what was put in US was it some
[1:40:32] form of a word was it some kind of a
[1:40:37] seed you know like a bean a potato
[1:40:40] corn or was it a
[1:40:46] word or was it God's
[1:40:49] predestination by his for knowledge
[1:40:53] brother Bram used his two
[1:40:56] statements he said the little woman at
[1:40:58] the well
[1:41:01] was had a seat in her from
[1:41:04] predestination from
[1:41:07] predestination then he'll say by
[1:41:12] predestination but that's the only thing
[1:41:14] that I've ask you today that I hope to
[1:41:17] the ones that are thinking on
[1:41:19] it did that little woman at the wh when
[1:41:22] that seed was quickened in her heart did
[1:41:24] she get eternal life if she did why did
[1:41:27] she ask Jesus Christ the
[1:41:32] Savor that's blun a it but you tell me
[1:41:35] it ain't right
[1:41:42] now you said when I just always believed
[1:41:44] I always was eternal well I think it's
[1:41:46] about time to quit believing that right
[1:41:49] now here's my Lifest amen but brother
[1:41:52] down we don't believe
[1:41:56] that well why are you sympathetic with
[1:42:08] it why do you play around with
[1:42:13] it why don't you just tell people I
[1:42:15] don't believe
[1:42:19] it
[1:42:21] what don't you do like I told you about
[1:42:22] that man up there that believe brother
[1:42:24] around was
[1:42:26] deity talking to him there in
[1:42:27] Jeffersonville he said yeah I believe he
[1:42:29] was God he was deity I said now pointed
[1:42:32] over to this other man I said that man
[1:42:34] there with a new birth if you'll tell me
[1:42:36] that man is deity with a new birth and
[1:42:38] we do away with all the gifts and all
[1:42:40] the things of brother around life we
[1:42:42] just come down to person to person and I
[1:42:44] said if you think he's got the Holy
[1:42:46] Ghost then he's deity I'll agree brother
[1:42:48] around was
[1:42:49] deity
[1:42:51] that's right he said oh no I'm not
[1:42:54] talking about
[1:42:57] that see there would no need to talking
[1:42:59] to him because he believed brother
[1:43:00] Brandon was
[1:43:03] God you said well people be that way
[1:43:09] yeah but Church get it one more
[1:43:13] time if we was
[1:43:15] anything before the foundation of the
[1:43:17] world other than in God's mind in his
[1:43:20] thinking as an attribute of
[1:43:23] thought then what kind of a doctrines do
[1:43:26] you
[1:43:29] have and if he was a thought in his mind
[1:43:32] did he have to put a seed in
[1:43:35] you or did he
[1:43:38] know the seed of the word of God would
[1:43:42] fall in you that's
[1:43:45] right did he know that you would accept
[1:43:48] it when others turn it down
[1:43:51] right
[1:43:55] amen what about
[1:43:59] it oh eternal life just a play thing to
[1:44:02] people eternal life is very serious to
[1:44:05] me because eternal life is a person amen
[1:44:09] there's not but one
[1:44:11] person of eternal life and that's
[1:44:14] almighty God yes come on musician then
[1:44:18] when almighty God comes to live in you
[1:44:20] and I
[1:44:23] then we can say we're Eternal
[1:44:26] amen think on these things but what
[1:44:29] about all these quotes what about
[1:44:36] them you mean we have spent 6,000
[1:44:40] years trying to come to a Plan of
[1:44:45] Redemption now do you agree with that
[1:44:47] we've been here 6,000 years right I mean
[1:44:49] come on we know the world hold lot older
[1:44:50] than that but mankind 6,000 years
[1:44:53] dealing with the Plan of Redemption try
[1:44:55] to get saved to go to heaven
[1:44:57] right and then we're going to wind up
[1:44:59] with
[1:45:00] it it always
[1:45:09] was we didn't need the new birth that's
[1:45:11] what it
[1:45:13] is we just need somebody to tell
[1:45:18] us and isn't that the bases of most
[1:45:23] people I told
[1:45:25] you brother Hal was
[1:45:28] there years ago when I was seeking the
[1:45:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost there was a
[1:45:33] certain brother there was a wellth
[1:45:35] thought of brother there and there were
[1:45:37] two other brothers and myself that night
[1:45:39] praying with the baptism of the Holy
[1:45:41] Ghost that brother's word was law with a
[1:45:44] lot of
[1:45:46] people and he said afterwards he said I
[1:45:50] believe you you three brothers receive
[1:45:51] the Holy Ghost
[1:45:54] tonight the other two took his
[1:45:59] word neither one of them is in the
[1:46:01] message
[1:46:07] today I was honest I said I didn't get
[1:46:17] nothing but you see I wasn't going to
[1:46:19] say what somebody else said
[1:46:22] it I was going to have my own
[1:46:27] confession if you can't say nothing
[1:46:29] other than my wife says it my husband
[1:46:31] says it my pastor says
[1:46:34] it a lot of people would love for me to
[1:46:36] point my finger at you and say you got
[1:46:39] the Holy Ghost I believe it but I ain't
[1:46:41] going to do it you're going to tell me
[1:46:43] whether you got it or
[1:46:46] not because you see I could be wrong and
[1:46:49] you'd spend all of your life depending
[1:46:51] upon what I
[1:46:54] said instead of seeking after god let's
[1:46:59] stand think on these
[1:47:02] things when was that seed put there
[1:47:04] before the foundation of the world what
[1:47:06] was that in God's
[1:47:10] mind in his
[1:47:12] thinking go we wouldn't
[1:47:15] people we wouldn't even
[1:47:19] spirits we only in his
[1:47:22] mind think about it go ahead start try
[1:47:26] 27 I don't know everybody knows of it or
[1:47:29] not we start off with chorus and we do
[1:47:32] the two

[1:47:55] you with
[1:48:00] our
[1:48:13] he I like that
[1:48:16] word because if we give into them they
[1:48:18] don't work good they just keep coming
[1:48:21] but if we believe
[1:48:23] it all is well
[1:48:26] father on the basis of what I've tried
[1:48:29] my best to preach

[1:48:35] said things maybe I shouldn't have said
