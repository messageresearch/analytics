holy holy holy we got to know turn it the wrong way man see everybody in the house of the Lord uh sister GW was requesting pray about the the people there they're from the sister that got killed it was from uh Durham North Carolina and I think she goes to the church where uh Master Robbie Turner Ruby Robby Turner I remember the name and all but I don't remember but she got killed in there Friday so just remember the whole family and everything you know that Lord would be with them and bless each one U Ryan and Gabby was going up to her parents this weekend but I don't know where today got to go or not because his grandfather was real sick so remember that remember Ryan's grandfather and I'm sure they must have went on but remember them the Lord would bless amen you like turn in your scriptures turn in Genesis 32 Genesis 32 had a good many comments this morning about what I had said about if you fold your arms you know it means you're not listening but a lot of them said they folded their arm this morning cuz it cold maybe that was a good point it was cold so we try not to freeze you but then the other side's are Fanning so you don't never know which way to run it it doesn't work out amen now what I'm going to do is it it take me about two services but then I'm going to probably put a gap in between so I want you to remember this service and the next one will be a background for something that that the Lord is beginning to deal with me about and I want to start maybe a little series uh in Revelations 5 and try to speak from that but now I may put because i' I've got some questions that I need to cover so you know maybe I'll get to them before I start the series but I just thought this would be a background for it and do it but I've got some questions on got one on marriage and divorce and one on like church order and and things and so we'll we'll try to cover them if we can the Lord willing I'm sure Wade will be ministering this next weekend and you know in doing but we will try to cover these so keep these messages kind of in mind cuz it'll be something more or less personally to you and I and that's what we want to talk about a true personal experience right you know you have a lot of experiences but there's always something that you can label everything or put it back on and anchor it in to a a a time of something that stands out in your life and all like that so just remember that Genesis 32 Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for your love and your grace we thank you most of all for being you and we pray that you would bless us now lead us in understanding and help us to Lord to deliver our hearts and to be you know receptive father as to what you would want us to be where we can speak then from our hearts to the people and just let your light shine Lord with each one remember those that are not with us Ryan and Gabby and W Jun there them and traveling coming back from the things we pray that you would would bless each one bless us here as we gather together to thank on you and to have you as the preeminent one in our hearts and lives we love you father father and we thank you we commit it to you now in Jesus name amen Genesis 32 we'll begin reading about verse 6 through maybe 13 and then jump over to just safe reading but I want you to notice that uh verse one it's not up on the board for you to read but uh the angels of God come and met Jacob this is when Jacob had went over you know and pass through bethl went over and he had um dwelt in the land and and got his wife and and everything and the two wives really because he wound up with Leah and then he wound up with Rachel working for then he's on his way back going towards uh where his homeland and remember the Lord is the one that told him to get up and go right so that's what I want us to get now he has many experiences but then he'll have an experience that anchors something that's what the point that I want with all of us we've all had many experiences but then there's something that you can tie your life to that will carry you all the way through see and that that will be the point okay so we'll say time read verse 6-13 and then 23- 28 and The Messengers returned to Jacob saying we we came to thy brother Esau and also he cometh to meet thee and 400 men with him then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed and he divided the people that was with him and the flocks and the herds and the camels into two Vans and said if Esau come to the one company and smite it then the other company which is left shall escape and Jacob said oh god of My Father Abraham and God of my father Isaac notice him the god of my father all right but watch what he says now notice that even if you look on the board it is it is not in a form of capitalization that he's speaking of in verse 9 and and Jacob said oh god of My Father Abraham and God of my father Isaac but notice what the other the Lord which sth unto me return unto thy country and to thy Kindred and I will deal well with thee I am not wor worthy of the least of the mercies and all of all the truth which thou showed unto thy servant for with my staff I passed over this Jordan and now I am become two bands deliver me I pray thee from the hand of my brother from the hand of Esau for I fear Him lest he will come and smite me and the mother with the children and thou sest I will surely do thee good now this is what Jacob says God has told him and make thy seed as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered for multitude see get the point now we'll get back to it see he should have known that he was going his brother wasn't going to give him no harm cuz God done told him what's going to take place but see we don't see it that way when we're right in the midst of a lot of trouble A lot of times we don't see the end of it and we don't listen to The Promise that's right you know and all like that it's that's that's what we're doing see that's my point I want you to see and he lodged there for that same night and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother 200 she goats and then going on down now jump over to verse 23 he gets all this over he sends it over gets everything ready maybe trying to appease his brother and he took them and sent them over the brook and sent over that he had and Jacob was left alone and th Wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the Hallow of his thigh and the Hallow of Jacob's th was out of joint as he wrestled with him and he said let me go for the day breth and he said I will not let thee go except thou bless me and he said unto him what is thy name and he said Jacob he said thy name shall be called No More Jacob for but Israel where as a prince hast thou power with God and with men and H haast notice prevailed you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now kind of just give a thought and you'll see that when we do get back to it and pick up something that you'll see we're dealing with a personal experience but I want I titled it true personal experience because of of the fact of uh as having many experiences but somewhere in your life you'll tie down and connect your your life to one thing and that'll be something personal to you he had as I said God sent him told him get up go back go back to your Homeland he gets up he heads out he starts going home and then he finds out his brother's coming to meet him you know now then he meets God or God talks to him and he said now I know like we was emphasizing there that you know I believe in in in in the god of Abraham and the god of Isaac he said now you spoke to me as the Lord you know the god of Heaven the capitalization that emphasizes the fact that he was you know dealing with God was speaking personally to him and he he begins to pray because he's concerned and he he's kind of reminding God that you said you'd do these things well it it's it's it's a fact that in our lives a lot of times that we even though we have great experiences you know it still comes along that Satan you know what will get you over today you know man AR way of saying it but what'll get you over today it won't get you over tomorrow all right each day has to have a personal experience with God that's why the Bible says give us this day our daily bread see it's the point that you you you've got to uh get everything settled today but tomorrow now it that becomes a background material to help us yes a wonderful thing but we need to daily have something dealing with us that's right all right now that'll be the point that we'll be getting to when we get back to Revelations 5 because I believe this this end time people is the only people that can really look into the word of God and see themselves in the word of God and be able to know exactly what's taking place cuz it was not meant for those others it's meant for you and I God doesn't do things foolishly he doesn't provide somebody or or you know he didn't send 14 guys down to deliver the children of Israel out of Egypt see he only sent Moses all right now you know how that I've always preached about Moses see he had had experiences with God he knew from his mother or what this was and what that was and and all like that and he had seen things and he believed it but that wasn't good enough all right he goes out and he he lives and goes into the desert but then when he gets ready to go back see God didn't God come to him and said all right Moses go down and deliver my people and he spoke to Moses and said I'm the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob well you know how I've always emphasized that Moses said I believe in the god of Abraham I believe in the god of Isaac I believe in the god of Jac all right said I'm not going until I have something personal you know something real to me because see you know we talk about the Scripture it does say you know that that no man can call Jesus the Christ except what by the Holy Ghost brother R said by the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right see and you because you don't want to say just what somebody else says yes right and see Jacob said well you know I believe in the god of Abraham I believe in the god of Isaac amen I believe God was with them and he delivered them and brought them through and said I need something myself right right now he's facing his brother all right and his brother done he done been told that his brother's coming to meet him with 400 men all right so he figures pretty well he's going to lose a lot of things all right he tries to make different ways of maybe appeasing so he sends his his you know great inheritance across many cattle many sheep many different things he sends them across ahead of you he sends everything across because he's trying to appease his brother right he's trying to make a way that his brother won't kill him right and you know what if God hadn't stepped on the scene you know what that's exactly what Esau would have done that's right he said well now not about well that's what I'm saying God stepped on the scene because it was his promise the reason he come on the scene to do it was his promise now and notice when you get on over later we spend a lot of talking about Esau and a bad things right but remember when the time Jacob got to Esau he had sent all of his inheritance over he's totally by himself he's even sent his wife and his kids and and everything actually just saying they're yours H you but when he meets ja meets Esau Esau would had a heart changed to him right right Esau didn't want to kill him read your Bible Esau said I don't want your inheritance I'm a rich man Jacob keeps only he finally deals with him until he gives him so much but he certainly didn't take his family and his kids and only he didn't take his life see CU God was already working you heard the prophet say like this he said as long as God's working on both ends right amen now that's the way I want to face things promises all of that's good experience is is good but I want to get to the point to where that I can say this is real and that's what Jacob was doing and he had many many experiences Moses had many many experiences right but when Moses come to that burning bush it was all settled he didn't care what happened down in Egypt he went down to take over amen Jacob sure he had problems but he met God and he said the Lord that speaketh unto me the one that's made me all of these promises you'll be with me did become come to a point that he was was beginning to get a little settled I guess in his experience but then when he wrestled with the angel of the Lord all night and what that means I don't understand cuz I don't think it was a physical wrestling you know I never have thought that that they and I there and fult with each other all night maybe you think that but I don't I think it was more of a forgive me for lack of words it was more of a um mental condition of existence within his being you know that he he was holding on within his own personal experience in other words he kept on maybe reminding that angel I believe you're from God and I'm not going to let you go until you bless me all right but see now when he got his experience of getting his name changed right now that was assurity that God was with him right and you'll find out really if you go through there and read it CU that's what I've been doing since I've had some time is reading through Genesis reading in in in the Kings and the different things and you know not having to think of things but things come to you and you know that it finally come in in Jacob's life that God had to come back down again and tell him that his name has changed yes if you'll study it even though he could say it been changed God come again and reminded it all right now that's the point I want me and you to think about we've had many experiences many things in our lives yes you know to talk about right but have we had an experience that we can put a life on right now I know you're not going to like this and those the people out there not going to like it but I just still tell it like it is my experience of coming into this message is not what I'm tying my experience to my experience was the day I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen that happened after I come into this message it wouldn't coming into this message do I anchor all things that's what most people lay on right yes they lay on that they have the B ISM with the Holy Ghost why I believe the message then you can go back to what we're talking about this morning and get into those statements that are made a lot of times it shows we maybe don't believe the prophet's message but see I put my experience the true experience personally was the day I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost because you can know the message right you can study the message you could have ate and and and hunted and and had personal and you know encounters with brother brandom and personal interviews and things like that and people do that and a lot of times I've heard people say that I had an interview with brother brandom and he said so and so well maybe we might misunderstand what he's telling us too but anyhow my personal experience is the new birth all right now that's what I'm trying to Anchor it to I want you to see that should be your anchor right all right it's not whether you say I believe the message right the devil believes all the message that's right all right it's not how long you've been in the message and how much you studied it that's right and everything else it's the personal experience of Jesus Christ within your heart all right now to show you kind of what I'm talking about see then we know that Peter referred to it one day and he said I was there on the mountain you know Peter James and John take it up into the mountain with Jesus you know and said I was up there and I saw these things but he said we have a more sure word yes of Prophecy yes right amen what's he talking about what is a more sure word of Prophecy than actually experiencing The Living Lord Jesus Christ that was there with him all the things they had went through in life and the doings what would be more real than that was the day he received the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's uh 1 Peter 1 1 one I think it's 19 or 1 n or whatever it is where he said said we have a more sure word of Prophecy something personal if the only way we'll ever see ourselves in the word that's right that's right is to first see Christ amen amen right that's we got to see Christ first that's right we see God first in the word that's right the people come in the message and say bless God I see myself and you know how I've always said it about people that do things people that come into the message fight and organize religion it won't be long they'll be leaving because they just find out there's as much organization around here as was back there but you see somebody come in and they get the revelation of one true and living God that person is more out to stay than the ones that see that it's organized religion was wrong am cuz they got something more that they can hang into the word right you know what what actually my wife and I talking about this the other night go down to brother Collins's what actually do you put it on that we're the bride we believe the message well now there's Millions around the world that are claiming this message that's right and there's all kind of doctrines and ideas that it went forth that's right from polygamy down to whatever of what we would say Believers of the message brother up here in the virgus or somewhere through that way he preaches that Jesus didn't have a physical Resurrection you know and he quotes brother brand more than I do you know as far as verbatim in a sermon all right but do we really believe it or has it been a personal experience is your experience real enough that you'd face Esau cuz that's where we're close to amen we're close to facing situations that could be and I've never been a doomsday style or do this I've just always said like I believe you know Let it go the prophet said they'd be persec come not tribulation now cuz we don't go through the tribulation but he said people could be shot on the spot well you're beginning to see those things take place yes is our faith going to hold us yes that's right Jacob had enough faith that he could turn around and start going home and he had enough believing that he thought he might be able to appease his brother by giving him all the things he had he finally sends him his family yes and thinking that he might look at them and see the descendants of Jacob and feel bad you know but that wouldn't enough but when he wrestled with the Lord and come through right he was limping when he left her that's right the rest of his life he was a limping Prince that's right and but he was a prince amen he was willing to go face his brother no matter what it meant as I said a moment ago if God had not have stepped on the scene Esau would have surely killed him that's right amen but God knew what he was going to do right but he let Jacob go through it that's right look like Jacob would have seen it when he says God says Jacob go home well probably Jacob in his mind was was thinking you know I I believe that was the Lord that told me that but said Lord are you sending me back to die you know are you sending me there to give my life and then he would meet him and have different things and and the Lord would bless him but yet he's still not certain of where he's at but one day he became real certain to him now anybody in the Bible that ever amounted to anything had a personal experience am with God Amen now I said about Peter said we have a more sure word of Prophecy even coming into the New Testament all right but you know you could take and spend years preaching this thought because you could start and take every profit and every profit if you'll get in there and readed every prophet in the Bible no matter if it was Micah and the little prophets you know whatever it was every prophet in the Bible had a personal experience right now one time I remember brother Brown talked about a prophet and the way he dealt was that he uh you know he spoke of his own life and God dealing with him all right but I looked this one up and I found one go ahead number one brother the message called preparation 1953 1111 says now SE her notice what he saying now word a vision Prophet you know now SE her a vision SE or a prophet whatever you want to call it a prophet is is a compound word just like sanctification is a compound word been cleansed and set aside there's many words and especially in our English words are compound now watch what he's getting at but a prophit means to give a personal experience under inspiration or foresee something now you get what I'm saying now every Prophet had a personal experience all the prophets were told to go and deliver the message right Jonah go down to Nineveh every Prophet you could cover it of each one of them lives and each one of them would wind up being to what he says now a prophet means to give a personal experience under inspiration or to foresee something he's a seer he's a prophet some of them dealt with visions right right y God would appear in Vision but some the scripture would say and the the word of the Lord came to Samuel maybe it's not an A Vision but it was a personal experience that the individual has if you ever trying to find and to and to to you know the people of this message and all they don't follow these things too closely but if I was looking to find a prophet in this day in the 54 Ministry I'm not looking for another one you know but I'm looking for in the 54 Ministry to be here all right everybody understand that not another Pro major prophet but fivefold Ministry Prophet but if I was looking and you told me so well brother Dale I believe this is a fivefold Ministry Prophet what I would do say I would listen to him very carefully and listen to him expressing his own way of seeing things or whatever but it always be listening to see if he was on the word and be keeping my eyes upon the word right because then I would remember that every Prophet brother randam said would always compare what he was seeing with the prophet previous to him amen see that way it becomes the Bible becomes the words of the Prophet yes right and we know the prophet is almighty God those men were not the prophets they were men with gifts given but the prophet was the god inside of them that's right and it was always a personal experience right right that's why I emphasize Jacob and I emphasized you know that the Lord spoke to him the god of Abraham the god of Jacob is fine but the Lord spoke to him now the Bible says if a prophet speaks presumptuously all right now you're supposed to really take them out kill them y you all right you see the people in this message saying that the Lord told me this this is what the prophet was talking about or some that are so dumb now to say the prophet didn't know how to say it but I know how to put it tell to you you know I know how to I can tell you where he made his mistakes and and all the things that he done and stuff like that you know but see a prophet now is someone who has a personal experience yes right and then expresses from his heart amen what he sees like uh naming non saying chariots Jing in the streets now he didn't say jicks and old mobiles running together here on the highway with headlights on but once the prophet brought that down into our language that was what he was seeing but what did he describe it as he described it as chariots cuz it's the only word he had running like lightning other words had lanterns hanging on you know uh who is Ezekiel Ezekiel Saw like fire falling I believe was all out of Heaven saw nuclear bombs and things probably but how could he describe it he put it in his own terms right right now listen to what I'm saying the god that told Mah and showed him what he saw is is our God not capable of being a able to write down Buick and O mobile running together in the street now come on right why didn't God choose to do it that way why is it that God didn't say Eve had relationship with the Beast could he not have written it yep could not Ezekiel say I saw an Adam Bomb fall out of an airplane and it blasted and you went all the fire or something like that what you see would if we had all those answers it wouldn't be no mystery right right that's right and then if you done that then you would have to write in the Book of Revelation come on you have to write the Book of Revelations there a little church up at Lula Georgia come on and they got you know 100 people there and they are the thing they spoken of in Revelations 5 amen see God doesn't do it that way does he so then each prophet only saw what God wanted s for the time right right okay and even coming down to the New Testament and the Apostle Paul Paul could say we're changed in a moment a twinkling eye don't you think he looked over and saw that but why didn't he say a little church up in Lula Georgia you you don't think he could have said it you don't think God could have said that then something wrong with your mentality but see it wouldn't have been a mystery that's right that's right it wouldn't have been a secret that's right see and then if it said that way you know what come on if it was said that way in the Bible then Lula wouldn't hold the people that's right I'm not a whole city amen right look on it said we got to be there because that what people's done in this message right A lot of them moved to jville a lot of when R around and went to Arizona a lot of them moved to Arizona that's right brother because they thought that's what it was supposed to be but you see God doesn't leave do it that way he leaves it to work that to me now this is the way I look at it that they would be a a Prophet come in the last days and that Prophet would not only be a seer of Visions seeing visions Etc foretelling things and the word of the Lord coming to him but he would be a born again believer you place brother random in the correct order bud you got something he wasn't just a prophet that got the word stalked out of the Wilderness and went back up in the mountain right he was a new testament Prophet I've heard that talked about and a lot of people you know the brothers not far from here believe that brother Randon was an old old testament prophet in the New Testament age well all they could teach was law they don't even realize it cuz that's what the the Old Testament prophets the only thing they could bring was the law right and speak according to the law that's right but you see he was a born again believer all right now not only that I believe he was an adopted manifested son of God put into the position of adoption right all right now in doing that look at the great position he was put in now that's only man in the Bible is putting that place even though Paul come on Paul was a prophet I agree with that you know a lot of people argue that say Paul wasn't a prophet but brother R said he was right all right now but brother Ram didn't say he was Miki 4 that's right he was not that kind right he was not written in the in the Bible that you know and you say well it is because of this that the other but it's not written in the Bible that a great man by the name of Paul is going to raise up and go forth as the first church age Messenger right that was written after Paul had done passed on but you see in what we believe this Prophet that we talk about was shown in the Bible amen Revelation 10:7 Luke 17:30 malach 4 shown in the Bible as to be coming then this Prophet could take all and you you'll get this when we come back to it later in Revelations 5 so study Revelations 5 and you'll see that this Prophet then could take the scripture and not interpret it by some of his own thoughts that's right but he could tell us what all of the prophets see when he would come forth and say look Malachi 4 says this and this and this and this right he is backgrounding do you understand yes he's got every Prophet that was prior to him that would be holler an amen to this man's message right because he would be describing what those prophets could not see yes he would be seeing chariots josing in the street and call them bu and O mobiles He Could See Fire Fall Out of Heaven as nuclear destructions Etc and in doing all of that he could break it down to you and I why because he had a personal experience yes something he could put everything on ain't that something the seventh grade education man is that embarrassing if you think I'm not right come on up and bring your Bible and come s with me he knew where he stood didn't he amen he not only knew where he stood he knew whereever Prophet stood now we think it it's a great thing that the prophet Moses that God could come down and he could write five books and he could actually write what happened in Genesis he could WR all of them things sure some of it by that time would have been CS cuz there's a lot of places I remember not too long ago we was all talking about it or something about the people that in Ser tribes you know their their business is to hand to keep the lineage you know and so you can go to them and they can tell you have lineage of everybody and everybody and everybody cuz that's what it's designed for you know but see this man wasn't just guessing at scriptures right this man's Prophet experience was to bring those scriptures and tell you what Isaiah said yes right in human terms to tell you what Micah saw I remember one time he said like this and I surely wish he'd went home but he said that a couple things he said one of them was that he said the one time he preached on on U Jacob no I'm not Jacob joob he said I preached 6 months me and brother Mo we we contacted everybody in the world we could find it thought we might be able get a hold those St I sure love to heard that wouldn't you you had him on the I heet for 6 months I'd love to heard that wouldn't you why because he was preaching something 6 months on a man on an ice Heat see he could see them things he not only seen it by by the writing of the word he he would see visions and things get on your uh what is it six seal I believe it's right now it's one in the seal book he said I I saw Moses walk out or something like that all right he was naming a prophet he said I've seen him walk out well see he wasn't just that wasn't just V jangling but he was telling baby he didn't see him walk out like that but he was telling it from his own experience right right something personal right amen that he could write the Bible right that's right but the problem was that people that wanted him to write the Bible was W him to add to it that's right right right well he couldn't add to it that's why when you look at my Bible and a lot of people when they look at it and see it they want to get it because 40 something years I've been wri down where brother explained that you know that's reason I don't like a new Bible but it takes me 3 months to copy all of those things the word brother around them explain that you know it tells you what that means now they've done a little bit of that back years ago and some of your know remember it they started out giving scriptures and you know and and they' show you around use this scripture well that was well and good but I like to write down what he said see because I believe that he brought from God the very you you different withen if you to okay I ain't talking about just a version of whatever you're talking about but brother R said this Bible as we have it today the thean and the butes own perfect place if there was ever a Bible before the world then this was the Bible that was before the world and the many other versions it doesn't compare to stay up then would not be it but they're part of it that's right cuz the King James version is actually a a a a compiling of many different versions that they took it and they put so many men in a room and they'd have to come out with the same thought upon that scripture before they would put it into what we call the King James version I read other versions I love to yes but my point is I believe we have the Bible correct why would I need other versions to explain it unless it's a breaking down of words you know expression of words all now but a prophet is one who has a personal experience and under that he foresees right and he can tell the very Mind Of God that's right and you would have to admit a lot of times we read your Bible and we don't see the mind of God right that's right but when the prophet comes along and tells you that right then you begin to say hey yeah I see it now yes well you know it didn't change the letters of the word that's right you know I know I've always been a St short thumb to a lot of people people but I know what that's what I talking about the people believe in 77 had to do that but you know the Bible said after 3 days or in the third day right after two days or in the third day will you know we to believe that right but see if brother Brandon would have say it Rapture is not coming until after the year 2000 you get my point or what yes hey we got made to 2,000 then we get ready cuz that's what people are saying and run around comes back in the tents and the things he'll tell us we're saved well then if that's got to be that we can't depend upon our own spiritual experience and there's something wrong with our we need a personal experience right right and see like me and P was talking about the other day brother random did say those things about 77 and I believe brother randam was looking for it to come before 77 cuz he was a human being right oh yeah but yet if you went back and asked him now he'd say but God told me to say that this way and that's the way I said it and then you can take it all and put it together and see that what he was saying was right all alone we misinterpreted that right to make him say what we think yes I remember a brother where the Bible was talking about there you know this generation shall not pass away and he said Israel went back to Homeland you know in 48 and this brother spent extensive time uh going over to Israel and things to find out that actually that the uh the charter what it was for Israel to become a nation was done in 46 cuz see his point was he wanted to come a little quicker everybody else would say in 80 you know 88 or something he he done missed all these others he's wanting it to come a little quicker so he figured out 46 to 48 and then 40 years added to that but you see what I'm talking about church yes and we got something personal enough that it will hold yes so I believe this message is right yes now there statements brother Rand will make and things he'll say that these brothers are going out you know say brother around was wrong here he's wrong there well there was human erors and statements that he made he said thing because he was a human being that's right he said one day he said the blacks and waterfly again D life well that hasn't happened yet but it may happen one day do you see Church do we have a personal experience as it now brother Dick's always said this about it and I agree if they put out now that brother randam had 40 wives and they could produce all their names and all their kids and all their grandkids and the great- grandkids by now what would you say what happened when 77 went by people were sending their books back to Jeff and getting out of the message right we see that person didn't have a personal experience you say they ain't say I didn't we ain't talking about salvation I am but right I'm not throwing nobody out right they throw theel out they can always repent and come back to the truth right but you see what about a personal experience that you know come on what are you depend upon about this message brother R was Vindicated that's what most people say right am I true most people put it on the Bas to brother around was vated that's I agree with it I believe it but you know the Bible said if a man give you a sign and it come to pass but he takes you to another God not to believe him that's Bible yet we said when we father because he was Vindicated I I wasn't there to see the dead raising the sick heal was you now there's brother how back there and brother Gary Joy Charlotte anybody else I'm missing I always miss something when I try to call around the people that was dark they actually saw these things praise the lord we have witnesses Among Us that saw these things that's good all right you know I believe them all but you know that didn't save me brother around being a prophet didn't save me there's got to be a personal experience of something that you can depend upon that that in your life it can't be questioned that's right you say well well I I stay with it because brother Dale preaches it what if brother Dale back slides where you going come on I don't mind talking plain like I think it's time to be plain about it but I'm talking about a personal experience do you have a personal experience enough until they can't deprogram you that's what they do right they trying to do they take a people and they send them down to these places and they deprogram them where they talk them out of it how do they talk you out of they tell you all the fallacies all of the wrongs all of the people that done this and all the people they don't never tell you the group they come from and all they done around and said it come down the psychiatrist having to treat the psychiatrist you know but what if he found out brother R was wrong on something but well and I know this has been said cuz it was just recently on the internet thing brother brandom said if you ever catch me off the word I won't call who was a man that doesn't it but this man it wasn't on the internet it was a man that all of us knew he said brother Rand said if he ever called him off the word but then he missed it right here what the brother said you know what he done he left the message cuz he had one thing that he could see that thre around him he thought was wrong what about it what's your experience based on my wife my kids grandkids great grand what what's your experience based on you said but but you shouldn't talk about brother random could be wrong around with humans what I'm talking about that is a human he could do things see we want the super dupers we don't never want all the truth we want well bless God he seen that bull and he just said bull you go lay down that boy and lay down but you don't never hear people say that he said if I had my gun I would have killed the bull and went and paid for it yeah you don't hear that quoted that's in the same story right but you don't hear it see it's the super dupers that we want to hear because we're PR trying to prop up a super duper in our lives right and I'm not discounting your experiences I'm just saying what I've said about Jacob he had many many experiences of great things Moses had many experiences sure but when he met the Burning Bush brother Brandon said there in 5 minutes was better than all the 40 years his mother and all the education he could have had to tell them who he was amen cuz he had something personal that's right amen I mean you want to pack up and go over to Russia and take over yeah come on you think about it the Man packs up and he heads down the road let me ask you something see if you see if you read your Bible or enough how many kids did Moses have who going to answer that two but you know he didn't have but one when he went to Egypt that's right you read your Bible but brother Rand will say Dar puts his kid on the hill other time he'll say they already had two kids zapor evidently got pregnant about the time that they got up to Egypt for Moses to deliver his message somewhere she did cuz when he went up there he only had one job that's right and read it read your Bible cuz it says in other words she goes home with What's um U what was Abraham's Granddaddy's name she goes home with him the number two child wasn't born in Egypt he was born over there you know when Moses leaves out and gets out of there his life didn't stay down in Egypt when all that was going on to deliver it she went back home and when you get over there he finds him and Moses has got two kids W you read your Bible then you don't argue about where brother Brandon was right or not you find out he knows what he's talking about Abraham I mean Moses had one child then Moses had two children and you find out how they got there that comes by reading your Bible you f g but listen Church you may have to read two or three chapters you may have to go from Kings over to the Leviticus I don't know what it what's the one word that they G from the Kings to the um chronic Chronicles all right you may have to go to Chronicles and read it right to find out what happened you'll find what is it in there in one of the scriptures is it Samuel or one other the the do and where where the David he has a man killed right then you got to turn over to the next one to find out why because that man touched and cut the head off of s of Saul and David had him killed but it's over in the next right it's not tiing that one where he tells about it Fe the Bible's got the answer if you understand what I'm saying those prophets would line up together now did don't be so carnal folks just just be honest and sensible now Isaiah didn't sit down and said well I wonder what let me get my computer and run up and see what David had to say let me get he may not have never read any of some of those right it was the Holy Spirit within the man that was lining up yes with all of the prophets and getting it straight that's right to where this Prophet could come and be a prophet with a personal experience right of the baptism of the Holy Ghost yes that those prophets back there could only have the anointing that's right and he could stand here and tell us what happened in Genesis name those people or whatever I remember the first time I heard him he said look there it it eeve said what did it say blonded and blueeyed I know he said blonde headed now where'd he get that from I just lucky he is no see maybe he seen something right M but it's a personal experience in a man I know what I'm I'll try to just cut this short go on but see you say that my pastor said so and so that's good brother rown said so and so that's good but is the holy spirit has it ever spoke to you come on about that now just remember there's a lot around the message that has said the holy Spirit spoke to them told him brother R was wrong now I don't I don't go along that okay I don't lay down my backgr of where he come from and why he would be the man and what is doing and laid it down I think through the Bible enough us to see it you know right all right see people say the Lord told me this right in the Bible times if a a Bible got person got up prophesied something didn't come to fight mom and dad take him out killed him yeah well we call Brothers right we call them all Brothers you that's brother so and so he's been the message law he heard the prophet now we got we got to and the prophet like I heard one one brother that he went out and done a bunch of thing wrong and this brother let him preach cuz he said the prophet ordained him how can I say he can't preach well I tell he ain't going to preach my f i don't care if he preaching in the world but I tell you ain't going to preach here see because that's my personal experience because we all got to have that now you you following me see see your mother's right your pastor right the Bible says no man can call Jesus say Jesus is the Christ only by the Holy Ghost amen now watch it this is a message of witnesses is recing Phoenix the Holy Ghost has to address it to you I mean excuse me has to witness it to you must be a personal experience now you see what he's talking about and all that he's given all of the years see maybe your mother maybe the things but you see why all the emphasis is always been made and he'll say well you know your pastor said he said but no man can call Jesus the Christ Yes except by a personal experience number three brothers go ahead personal experience with God preaching 54 paragraph e13 he talking about Moses had a personal experience he said that's what the church needs tonight is just stop studying on much theology listen it's just stop studying on so much Theology and get down to the altar and pray until a personal experience burns down into the human heart and burns out all the dullness and gives a gives a new vision amen then you got your Doctrine you got your theology fine why because you're dealing with it personal experience with God also same e14 is right on down he's talking about Moses he talking about the Holy Spirit coming down on the apostles who said such as I have that's what we need to Den not an experience personal with God Moses got the personal experience now watch Faith jump in what's the difference in Moses now away he goes to Egypt a oneman Invasion going down to take over nothing in his hand but a dry stick but he went down to do it and accomplished what God told him to because he had a fresh vision from God Amen if anything the church needs tonight and what we're trying to do friends is to bring a fresh vision from the presence of God now listen to it to let the people see that God still lives and Reign and moving with his church and he will until Jesus comes to receive it a vision experience that's what we need see we need each one of us need a personal experience with God and a vision right of what God wants us to be amen and how to go out and live it before others and line up with it look at the next one Jubilee year 1954 paragraph 113 Christianity is longsuffering goodness meekness gentleness patience is that right Christ when he was reviled he reviled not again is that right Christian Christianity is the life that a man lives it's a personal experience personal experience power of the devil I never have heard that tape I want to get back and listen to that one day I never noticed the title of it the power of the devil preaches Chicago 1955 10:05 paragraph E8 Jesus said except a man be born again he cannot understand the kingdom of God there's no way of understanding until you are born again and then God reveals himself to you and then you know that you pass from Death un life because no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Spirit see the only way that you'll ever know that Jesus is the Christ is when the Holy Spirit personally witnesses to you that he is the resurrected Lord Jesus no matter what he would do what kind of signs what kind of Miracles you'll never know it until you're personal experience with God and he goes on to say you'll never know it until it's revealed never know it watch this one message call Faith 19th 57 12:29 paragraph 45 how little it was for Abraham after he had endured as seeing him who was invisible now we quote that a lot done Abraham saw him Abraham doubted his doubt when he start explain that's when I left the prophecy how little it was for Abraham after he had endured as seeing him who was invisible after he had endured now after he met God and had an experience of talking face to face with God that he could call those things which were not as though they were wasn't there all of his life was it is after he had an experience right after he met God face to face he says for he had an experience he had talked to God face to face that's what we need is a personal experience with the Living God Amen all right contending for the faith 1956 Parra E7 or E7 he said the teachers he's explaining to a man you know about that the teachers hasn't been wrong but they just missed it look what he said but what is it said you'll never know Christ by theology you'll never know Christ by education you got to know Christ by personal experience to be born again of his spirit that comes down and CH changes your life and makes you a new creature in Christ Jesus that's what does the difference that's what makes the difference of you now that now that's the reason we have so many different denominations and theories and things drop down then now to be born means to be delivered from now unless you are delivered by the holy spirit in your life to a new creature in Christ now unless you are delivered by the holy spirit in your life to a new life in Christ then our Creeds and things are no good watch but they're good you're all right there are moral teachings and so forth it's okay doctrines and teachings so it's moral teachings and that's fine which helps us but the real person Christ Jesus that's what was has made the meetings what it has been today and swep around the world is because by the grace of God to introduce to the large of our small crowds a resurrected Lord Jesus listen right now present tense in the same power that he ever was we don't have to guess about it that's what the message that's why the Divine Healing had to go forth that's why there had to be a healing campaign to show that there was a god that lived and the resurrection was real we heard the resurrection story right yes coming up Easter everybody preached on Easter Resurrection you know they preach this you and they preach he is risen you know and they get away from it he was risen and get out to he is risen and oh everybody thinks they really know what to talk about and that's good moral teaching right good moral teaching need to be taught yes well what about the person experience come on right have you experienced the resurrection or is it just words watch what he says but from the beginning it wasn't so 1958 paragraph e48 you say then these signs follow them he's a good old man he pays his tithe he works good he treats his neighbor right if that's all it took look Christ didn't have to die right it takes a personal experience of passing from death into life and becoming a new creature in Christ Jesus which is in the heart that's the Holy Spirit that's where it begins look at the next one it is I preach 1960 E15 I think every person that goes out to preach the gospel should never go until they have a personal experience of the B baptism of the Holy Ghost now one time he said meet God on the back side of the desert like Moses did well okay we all got to go to Egypt whever where to Backside the desert now that's not what he's talking about right a personal experience right right I believe that that was the qualification that Jesus gave them turn to seity of Jerusalem until your end with power on high then you shall be my witness in Jerusalem Judea Samaria fre Port Louisiana as it would read like that I hope that don't sound back religious but you know what I mean by it no person no matter how well you're educated how smart you are in the Bible the devil's twice as smart as you are yes sir he could twist it and make you look like Ned in the first reader some of us remember that right right oh your older one don't know what n in the first reader talking you never went to school when they said See Spot run See Spot Run Spot Run see week after week after year after year you finished the first grade you got out of net in the first reader you got in spot the second reader but now listen no matter how much you're educated what's going on listen to what he says here on presuming 62 117 there's only one Creed in the Bible who then we I don't Creed yes we do right no Creed but Christ oh no Creed but Christ so there's only one Creed in the Bible Christ come on are you listening yes we said we don't have no Creed brother R said there's only one Creed that's Christ in a personal experience he's not a Creed he's a living reality right amen see we only have to to know him is to know is to have life outside of that there is no way to life outside of knowing Christ by personal experience with him not by joining a church or reciting a Creed and when you only bring it to that shallow condition now listen to what he said when you only bring it to that shall of a condition can I paraphrase it to know the message of the hour to believe brother around was a prophet to believe all these things is a shallow condition come on that's why we have drunken New Year's parties by Christian so-called that's why we have celebration of Christmas and New Years and other holy days and so forth next one what shall I do with Jesus called Christ 63 11:24 paragraph 185 how the church ought to be checked it again and again and again and again we're waiting for his coming we're waking we're waiting for the takeoff we better check it with the word now what not what somebody said be sure you know yourself as a personal experience with Christ check it again and again and again why because we got the blood of Jesus Christ in our hands all right one more the T in church age with church age book 239 now I want to read the scripture here then read what he said Ephesians 3:16 that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with the might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is a breath and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God now look what he says now according to these verses when a man experiences the depth of God in his life it is an actual personal experience of the spirit of God indwelling him in his mind is illuminated by the wisdom and knowledge of God through the word amen through the revealed word right a personal experience but when your experience hold you that's all the master if it won't get one it will they put the gun to your head one day might change a lot of things you know but one you got to wait for the gun to be put there why can't we say that God is one that's holding us amen my personal experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth in 1969 is what I'm talking about from there can be a growth development in your new birth through the knowledge and understanding of God's word that's why I read that lastely from that new birth that you received from there and from there only can the message become alive and yet I've read the message for two years before I ever receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost but see most people would and I've had one preacher sure he argued with he said what do you mean he said you believe the message didn't you bless you I said that don't mean I've got the new birth right that means I got a good head knowledge I've got the moral teachings of whatever right but I don't have an experience do you have an experience in your heart that'll hold you you know if we got an experience with God a real true one amen then a message like this morning won hurt it will help am if we had a personal experience amen if not our feelings are hurt a personal experience leading up to Matthew I mean to Revelations 5 we've got to be able to see ourselves in Revelations 5 where brother R said this is the actually the opening of those Seven Seals is the word he said in Revelations 5 I tried to say something years ago and theyd back away from it I'm come back to it I'm going to say it we've got to have a personal experience or else we will not fall in the truth right right you got all kind of doctrines that brother brandom open the seals and this happened or that happened Seven Seals not even open yet to say this is a they got all kind of doctr what's your personal experience I told you that they told me when I come in message during 67 you know begin reading in ' 66 and come on in ' 67 they told me I couldn't be saved after 63 I said well I'm sorry I don't believe that you know if I believ that I'd have just set Downs I guess I missed it they say I can't be saved but you see I didn't care what to say I had experiences with God and you've heard me tell of them but you see I knew when I heard this message I did not have the new birth well how'd you know brother Dale because I seen a man talking about something that I know wasn't in my heart oh I had all of the moral teachings right yeah I saw a man talking about a God that I met when I was 11 years old and I just couldn't find no more you think I didn't want to follow that man that he talked about that talk about a god like that see what caught me I told you over and over what caught me of the message was the plain of the Prophet to be able to even tell us all of his problems right and the things of his life that had went and how that he tried to commit suicide on two different occasions amen all the things he had told us and I read one day where he said like this he said do you think them Pride Jews would have ever told about Abraham lying and giving his wife wife away and put it in the Bible you know it's in their Bible you know he said they wouldn't have done it but said God made them put it in there see they need told his problems and troubles I seen a man that was a human being amen but then all at once he would tell you what the Bible said and i' rejoice right I told you about it taking the Bible and and the prophet's message and laying down and saying God this man here even says that there'll be false prophets come in the last days what if he's one of them you know the Lord didn't spend no whole lot of time talking to me and telling me all about he's Vindicated or anything he done you know what he said and what does the Bible say right that's all the Lord ever spoke to me on on that two different occasions that's what he said than what does the Bible say you know and that was when I wasn't born again and see I've never claimed it then I didn't claim it until I saw what it was and then received it because it became a personal experience come on a personal experience with Jesus Christ to where then you don't mind talking to the world as they're out there listening some trying to catch you in your wording some trying to do all kind of things see I don't worry about it I just tell you what I believe the best I can I know I make human errors so forgive me out there and all like that I know I make mistakes in my life of you know saying things sometimes wrong and calling names different or whatever and you know then I find out read brother around I'm call him wrong he'd say Mary and Martha and there nothing the other you know justed a human but you see that's enough for some people to turn against that's an excuse enough for some people to turn down the message that's right was never far then let's stand again go ahead let's try number 61 in the red book my hope is BU on nothing Jesus BL and right I dare not the spe he had a personal experience or is it I believe if I was bringing this message to the Rand of Tabernacle I would ask his children he had a birthday perod what do you mean I'm the child of the Prophet the son of the prophet got in a lot of trouble L time the Bible but a man with a caral experience it's not just it I believe experience can it talk you out of it or can you that you can only quote what the prophet said your own experience you ask most people something they say brother said that's what somebody else say in his right I want the Holy Spirit to be in here and speaking back out that's the one that's kept me from the erors of this exper about have in his rightousness for Christ rock all see the Bible even says you know that I'll cause your enemies to be at peace with you you know the Bible says let in the shadow I'll cause your enemies to be at peace with you only look at Jacob afid of Esau but didn't realize it God over working on ES and es come back over he wanted to give what a wonderful call Ser standing somewhere in the shadow you find Jesus he the only one who cares and understands standing somewhere in the shadow how you know him how did Thomas know he said here Thomas put your hand over here see put your hand in m died you'll know it's me you know it's still the same to you and I he still got them nail prints in his hands today same I don't believe they'll ever disappear in eternity they'll always be there and we'll always look and see him and realize what he's done for us you can't well how can you have eternal Nails cars I don't worry about it I just leave itar all things are ready come by all I want you and I to have is a personal experience of a new bir we can say the god blinded mind that blinded the blind people walk their own way of people who walk their own way and not according to God's word Den I think he do Den iing the same about Jesus real to you or M and daddy word is that all it is and what somebody else say when we have something personal you the is for all things are ready now come I the darkest the land don't ever think that you done wrong throughout the this worldon
