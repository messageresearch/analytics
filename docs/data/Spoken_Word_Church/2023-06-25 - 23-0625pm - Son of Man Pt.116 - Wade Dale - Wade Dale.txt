know um you remember when Jesus left and came back on the day of Pentecost and just a few days after that you got um Peter I believe what Peter and John wasn't at the gate beautiful what'd they say look on us right look on us look look this way don't worry about what's going on here don't look down at your feet don't worry about what the next guy's doing over here look on us Focus focus on us they wouldn't it wasn't Peter saying hey look at me no you're saying Focus because what I got I'm fixing to give to you and I don't want any distraction for that and uh that's kind of like what brother Ryan was talking about distractions in here we we're all guilty of of saying things in church that are you know shouldn't be not that they're not to be sad it's just the timing of it and make sure all of our conversations and I know there's sometimes you can't help it but try to do it outside make sure the next service is not Disturbed all right so let's go to the let's go to John 1 1 remember brother Bob will be back uh I'll be speaking Wings tonight so just keep me in prayer brother Joe Canada and then they're on vacation we've got several ones that are out uh be remember the byc camp in October uh sign up see if you can go with them uh July the first that's just coming Saturday we'll have service at five o'clock Brother Richard Douglas will be with us and then the next day will be brother Mike ortig and we'll only have one service and we will have a meal afterwards and if you are coming you need to make sure that you see brother Terence Sister Lisa for the menus so you can go ahead and pre-order um your menu so that they'll have it ready after the service is over they'll be out here in the yard with a truck and we just go pick it up call your name or your family I don't we need every person needs a paper all right so if you got five people in your family you need five papers to tell what you want um for them to fix and they'll fix them while we're having service but we sure appreciate them doing that for us remember July 14 15 16 we'll be at brother Andre heads there's now about 55 going so please if you're if if you're not going to go on Friday night you need to let me know because I don't want to get 15 rooms for Friday night and about 10 of you show up Saturday all right so if you come in Friday that's cool if you come in just Saturday that's fine we'll get you one room but we we don't need to get more rooms than we need Friday and they said empty and we have to pay 200 a night for the room and it just sit there empty all right so just make sure you let me know some have told me already but they won't be here there until Saturday which is fine but we need to know to get rooms or not get rooms so it's going to be close to 55 people going uh they will I forgot to announce this morning there will be a service here brother Bob black is coming back Saturday night and he's going to be doing the service here on Sunday they'll only be one service it will not be live streamed it will be recorded um I think Josh will be here Michael's can't get off work so brother Michael will be here he can lead singing brother Bob will be doing the speaking but there'll be one service and it will not be online all right because it won't be anybody in the back they'll all be up there all right so but we will record it on a CD like we have always before and we keep them and and brother Joe and then we'll be able to put that online in case you want to listen to it but there won't be any uh video that I know because everybody else is going to be in supporting uh brother Andre up there at his church and then remember make sure you tell us whether you're going to stay for the farmer's daughter to go eat Sunday afternoon after service and please let us know if you're going to stay or not stay all right so just keep these things in prayer all right let's uh let's go to Lord in prayer remember also July 29th about the singing on Saturday we'll talk about that a little bit later so it's almost July already so another Year's heading out here but we're one day closer we're one day closer to getting out of here one day one day closer one 24-hour day so let's pray dear Lord thank you for giving us this day and as we were told to pray give us this day Our Daily Bread Lord and we know that John said on the Isle of Patmos that he was in the Lord's day so it's not a 24-hour day but it's a day that you are present and Lord I pray that you would show your presence today Lord into speaking of your word and the hearing and the revealing of your word Lord in the revealing of our healing Lord we all in this building need something in our body for you to touch and Lord we pray that you'll touch us father and be with us now in the further in this service be with each one that's sick and not with us ones that are on vacation the ones that are traveling Lord we pray that you keep your hand on them Lord as they travel back home Lord forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes be with us in this service in Jesus name hey Matt in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and that word is fixing to form somewhere and was made flesh and dwelt among us and we behold his glory the glory the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth she may be seated Lord has blessing to the reading of the word Philippians 2 verse 3 because we're going to get to this I hope this afternoon it says let nothing be done through Strife for vainglory but in lowliness of Mind Let each esteem other better than themselves all right so we're talking where when you get to that word selfish that takes that out of the way if you esteem others better than yourself you have took selfishness out of the way because look at that last word themselves you esteem someone else better than you II Peter 1 verse 5 we know that we're heading down let's keep on going because now we've went from godliness now we're parked on brotherly kindness but just remember I want you to remember that that God told us through a prophet God told us in the Bible he told us through all the prophets that there would come a day that there would be a bride on the earth that would be without spot or wrinkle not that we were going to go to heaven and get that but that somebody's going to come to that here on this side so someone is going to have to come to completion Perfection uh that Genesis 1 26 man in full view as we were talking about this morning that's very important that Genesis 1 26 man is your new birth that is your and we're going to read it in just a minute brother random talks about all these other loves being created because remember in the Garden of Eden you started with agape love there was love that and it was no perversion there was no they were both naked and I'm sure they both sat around and talked with each other and they all had they've held hands or they were husband and wife but with that Holy Ghost Veil on them there was nothing to um just try to make it clean or bank at PG there was nothing there to to to make them do what they did later on right all right because they had a holy ghost Veil so see you get the Holy Ghost it'll help you I promise you it'll help you with your desires and your lust and your wants and all those different things I said it would help you you're still a free moral agent you still live in a I was going to say a dog body you still live in a human animal body so do I let's just be honest we don't we can't walk around like this all the time you know that's right because you know let me let me let me just let you in a little secret life lesson 473 that's why the priest and and the Catholic priest do what they do there's a desire in man to procreate there's a desired man to get with a woman and are you white and procreate right but when that's when they told in the Catholic church that you can't have a wife they got to fulfill their desire somehow and that's what gets down to perversion as we talk about brother Brown so that was created not by God it was created by the devil that love is turned to lust and all that other stuff if they would let them priests have wives they wouldn't do the things they do amen because that's where to get into trouble but you see though it's the perversion of the doctrine that they've been told that you got to stay single man I don't understand that they said Peter was the first pope he had a mama I mean he had a mother-in-law right so he was married you see how perverted that is though because we just say oh well okay it's the Catholic church and they tell us to do this and that's what we do no if you'll get Christ in you as we're looking here today if you'll get Christ in you the hope of glory there's only one way that God's going to totally identify himself in the end time is through me and you in human flesh in a animal body that's what we all are brother Ram tells us we're animal flesh that's why we come to the higher order of creative evolution is he created the animals in human flesh and then he created man in his own image though and he created us Spirit man first then he put this in too the Genesis 2 7 man which was a body of Flesh which is animal flesh a higher form of Flesh and then there's where man fell and God knew that but he could not display his attributes or any of these right here you all know if we didn't have a fall there wouldn't even be a Bible if there was no fall there wouldn't be a Bible there would be no need to make one you would be the children of God and God had you all in his mind and you came in in continuance uh Adam and Eve gets together speak the word of God hear you come and here you are and that's when you just start living in a life and then all of a sudden your body is going to be made Eternal somewhere down the road isn't that what brother Brown was talking about their news was being renewed this didn't have to be renewed this is the Genesis 1 26 man the Eternal part of God amen can't lose that God will never give you eternal life and take it away from you he didn't give eternal life to Adam and take it away from him he didn't give it to Eve as bad as what she did he did not take it away from her he took away from her the ability for the whole form to be Eternal because that's what we're going back to the whole form of me is going to be Eternal the whole form of you is going to be made Eternal that's Body Spirit and soul everybody with me but it's Christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach you know I was just a few minutes ago everybody know who's Adrian who Adrian Rogers is most of you do but he was a wonderful he was a he'd have been a good message believer but he was a good preacher he was kind of like the Charles Stanley and the different one but Adrian Rogers was um he was a a pastor of a church and he was kind of the first one that really I think went online and and and not online but they recorded his sermons and he they put it alive anyway he was preaching a few minutes ago I was watching it it's a striking thing he said you know he said he said if you don't make Church important okay then your kids are going to look at you all right if your kids look at you and see that you don't think church is important they don't think church is important that's why it's parental delinquency brother round said the the adults quit going to church in brother Brown was time and that's why he would look at him and say hey it's not a kid's problem it's your problem but if you don't make that important but if you make it important then the kids are going to see that it's important and that generation that's why the generations of churches are you know falling apart and different things oh yeah there's a lot of people going to church but are they really going to church and I I like what he said you know he said you got to make it a priority because if you don't make it a priority then it's not going to be a priority to your kids and that's pretty simple I mean you we try to say well we need to come to church yeah I I thought coming and being a Christian was living for others I come to church to live for others I come to church to bring something to you fellowship with you watch your kids grow up that's what brother Dale did for a generation he watched it Generations grow up and and still sitting here most of them but why do we make important when I when I said whom we preach look warning every man there's a warning love has a warning to it and listen true agape love is weird according to humanity agape love is weird because then nobody likes it Jesus was the epitome of agape love they hated him right he was the epitome he wasn't just part of agape love he was all of agape love everything he did even when he planted the room drove the people out hello somebody and drove the people out of the temple that was agape love because agape love has judgment connected to it right agape love has something attached to it that when you have filial love and don't get me wrong sister Junior I've been married 45 44 years 45 years coming up wow we still have issues well okay then pray for us we're the only ones [Music] and we'll never come to that Perfection like we'll come with the Lord because we're on this side of humanity all right but we're preaching warning every man teaching every man in all wisdom so we're being taught when we do come to church and we do come to be better husband and wife but better wife to God than anything else I want to be a better wife to God I want I like what somebody said the other day I was watching somebody online and it was it was beautiful because you got all this gender stuff we were talking about not too long ago you know they're this and this you're gonna be a man or a female or whatever you want to be a dog an animal a pig whatever you want to be that's what you can be but God didn't set it up that way and when it fell from that that's when it all fell apart so listen if that made it fall apart we got to get it all put back together but if a woman will look at a man and say hey I'm gonna trust you to be the head I'm gonna trust you to be the headship I'm going to trust you to do your job I'm not going to tell you how to do your job you know sometimes you hold stuff up see if anybody shoot at you how to do your job you say the same thing I appreciate you if you stay in your position in your Godly position everything will be fine if you'll start that way you won't have a lot of problems instead of saying well now you've got to be my head no that's the headship what am I saying we don't have to remind Christ that he's the head we got to believe that he's the head not tell him what to do but do what he said amen do what he said trust him I trust God enough that whatever he tells me that's exactly what I need to do yeah right hello yeah I mean instead of instead of no well I don't know if I want to do that I don't believe I that cutting hair business or that going to church business ah you know that really ain't for me well see you've come out from under headshot anytime you come out from under the word of God you brought you but you're naked yeah what happened to Eve when she stepped out from under head ship she should have said hang on a minute we're getting too deep here let me go get my husband because he's my head and whatever he says that's what I'll do even though they were co-equal in the uh in the creation there where brother Brown talks about still he was her head because he was the husband all right because that whole establishment has to be that we look at Christ and say God whatever you say that's what I'll do because you're the head you're the husband you're the man you're the man right you the man I want you to stay the man I know you're the man need that I want to say where I'm at all right everybody with me so that's what preaching does preaching brings headship preaching tells us what we're required to do by our head because our head is who Christ our head is the Bible because the Bible is Christ amen the message of the hour it's an enhancement of what we already got in this right here remember it gives us a love letter if we have a question there's an answer to that and if there's not a direct cut answer then God sent us a prophet to give us what do you say the correct interpretation by divine inspiration he sent us somebody that we can depend on I can depend on this message [Music] to be correct so let my put my then I put my all my worth in that what happens there's a lot of people that want especially like ones that are leaving the message what they've done is they've never had true heads yet they've always thought they had a little something extra that brother Brown didn't bring or something less uh you know a quote their own self or something like that you know where brother around really didn't mean that no be submissive get out of the selfishness that we're in right that's gonna that's gonna stop us from being now that's not gonna stop us from being Christians if you're already up to to brotherly kindness you're getting pretty good but you're not an adoption yet you're heading toward adoption you have the spirit of adoption but you're not have come to adoption to where he puts that stamp or gives you that ring and says I can trust you with what I've already said I can trust you with this message of the hour and there are certain people that that um that have come to that place amen that have come there has to be there has to be somebody that comes to that position to be able to teach us what brother I'm saying the statue of perfect man he said Lord amen and we've been around uh brother Dale different ones I I believe he's come where God can speak to the man and and come to adoption okay I'm just going to say that I believe that and we're happy and we're heading in that direction because you got to have somebody that knows what they're doing to get you there how are you going to get a first grader to tell you what's going to happen in college no you need somebody in college to tell you what college is going to be like amen all right same way with the the word of God because remember if you'll remember many many times in your Christian experience things were strange okay some of your nodding some of your sleep but it's strange because it's contrary to what you were raised in it was contrary to your nature all that cussing good party in nature but then when that got pulled out of me and I can replace him with words of wisdom and maybe with words that are not that that cut like that strange that's strange for us and it's hard I know it's hard it's hard to do a lot of things but God give us a uh he gave us a way to do it and he gave us a position to come to right and this age requires adoption which requires we come to that statue of a perfect man up to where it says holy spirit we must come to that to where the disciples were to where Peter and John could say Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have what they had that they had it to right here because remember the headstone had left so the seals are not open they knew they had to go on Paul knew that he was going to pass he didn't he did he was trying to remember brother Ryan said he was trying to tell people that the Rapture wasn't going to take place during his time now what about a Ministry whether where he was revealed to him that hey there's a lot of work I'm just the bottom of this thing I'm just a foundation right right but remember he called himself a master builder he was a master builder because he was the first one to get that Foundation right and then now me and you have come to a place to where we can live Godly all who live Godly in Christ shall what suffer persecution all right that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus now look it didn't say perfect in yourself it said perfect in Christ Jesus we have to look at Christ because he was our example all right so that's where godliness and brother Brown says yes you can I like that you want to put that on your refrigerator oh yes you can thus said the Lord you can do it and listen the reason he could say that is because by the spiritual eye of a prophet he could see somebody come to that I believe he could see that his message would bring somebody to that that the message he was bringing was not for that group around him it was for a group coming it was for a group that was going to put those 1100 sermons because you can ask I mean like sister cleator in different ones you know brother random would make the circle like go to Macon and it would be like three years later before he'd go back get to back to making again look at your look at your dates so he wouldn't it's not like he's going to sit here and they were at the Tabernacle every Sunday no he would you know preach at different places and come back around and that's all they had they'd have 1100 sermons they didn't have 1100 sermons on their watch to where if somebody says something they pull up a quote we do we do we have it instantly available right here in front of me I can throw any quotes you need up here within about a minute all right does that make us puffed up and heady and high-minded no it does not it makes us to where we can get available information through the preaching of the Gospel the only way the word is going to be made flesh is true Doctrine to the doctrine which is according to Godliness so there's a Doctrine according to Godliness and they're together they're matched so somewhere there's a Doctrine that's going to take us or a set of ideas or beliefs that are taller believed to be true and but it's going to take us somewhere listen the doctrine of the Baptist is going to take them somewhere it's gonna take them sorry to the tribulation period the Methodist Doctrine is going to take them to the tribulation period right is our Doctrine going to do that too think about it it will not if you'll stay in that Doctrine as Paul said continue in my Doctrine continue in this Romans 1 verse 16 says for I am not ashamed of the what I'm not ashamed of this message I'm not ashamed of this gospel I'm not ashamed of it because it's the power because there's power with characters we were talking about this morning pie with character it's fit to rule power with character you better know one thing for sure the first thing you got to get ruled over is this guy all right that's the first thing you need to get rulership over is this guy and not me you take your finger and point to yourself this guy right for I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that what believeth so now remember we were talking about having a holy ghost Veil I believe that when we come to this right here now don't get me wrong when we come to this we're going to talk about it maybe next time brother Brown said it was just like waves it's something that covers over us it's kind of like as brother Ram was talking about the honey man if you can get honey in something or or uh it's real sticky and it will go into all the cracks and crevices and just for a little while it'll stop everything up so that's what the Holy Ghost is doing now I believe the holy ghost is now falling on us to fill in the cracks sure it's still saving sure it's still doing things but it's coming to a time to where we got to come to a place to where we got to have all the cracks filled every crack has got to be filled because you know who's going to step in that crack Satan is going to wait till that crack opens and he's going to step in it so we've got to have it where we're right up here where we know we have the virtue of God we know we have the knowledge of God the tempers of God the patience of God and that we are Godly right amen and that we have brotherly kindness that we're fixing to talk about here in just a minute we talked about this this morning let us make man in our own image you know we preached I was thinking about yesterday we brother Dale preached on this probably in early 2000s 2000s about this Genesis 1 26 man and it's never been exhausted since then for 20-something years we just keep adding and keep preaching and keep preaching on this Genesis one and seeing more and more of what this Genesis 1 26 man was it was every believer that gets the baptism of the Holy Ghost and there is no way that it was ever created as we see created is there was not then it is because if we had a beginning if this had a beginning this has got to have an end the new birth did not have a beginning it did in you but it didn't in God all right we'll read it in just a minute because remember love every love is temporary except agape love every love every love is gonna go away when we get on the other side what is on the other side brother random perfect love perfect love is agape love you cannot have perfect love and have feel your love Peter love has conditions it has cracks it has holes it has lups it has downs am I preaching to the right congregation today to me Agape Love Takes to human emotion out of it think about that because Jesus Christ said I wish that all would be saved now he wished that but he knew they wouldn't so his Zeal was okay I want everybody to be saved but I know that they're not all gonna be saved so therefore I'm not going to force it on anybody I'm going to put it out there and then I'll see I've already seen who's going to accept me and who's not going to accept me but I got to put it out there anyway so then in the Old Testament he starts with Moses David Sampson we were talking about it this morning they had power but they didn't have character to go with it and they were somewhat messed up in different different times of their life but you and I are not that anymore we have the blood of Jesus Christ to take care of all sin listen it's still a sin killing gospel folks I'm telling you but let's talk about brotherly kindness let's get into this let's skip some of this remember it means it's Philadelphia or brotherly love it's the love of brothers or sisters and brotherly love we're going to let the Bible explain to us what Brotherly Love is if that's all right and it's the love of Christians that they cherish each other as Brethren and God is love but love typically produces obedience that's what we were talking about if I if I have the correct husband or the correct wife and I love them even with filial love but that's what brother Brandon remember what he said he said pick a husband and wife he said don't pick them by outside appearances because I feel your love that's even lust right right he said look at their what character how many times have you heard us tell you kids get born again marry somebody that's born again because at least you have agape love in your soul and somewhere you can get in there with video Love all right it ain't gonna be a a cure-all because you have filial love because you're a human but that agape love in your soul is what you need to let take over and lit that will produce obedience being disobedient is what gets us all in trouble husbands wives sisters brothers being disobedient is what gets us in trouble and usually it's not just one person it affects a lot of people right um for those who do trust in Christ in other words make them your head and just trust in what he said they receive what they don't deserve which is Grace and withheld what they really deserve which was Mercy which side are you on do you have eternal life or you still have the wrath of God abiding on you and I said in you because that's where it is so this is where we're at this morning let's start right here just for a little bit um Matthew 24 verse 12 says because iniquity shall abound now what is Iniquity iniquity is knowing to do better and you don't do it or you know to do it and you don't works both ways all right and because iniquity shall want abound in other words he pop it's not going to be just a little bit the love of many so what eats the love of God iniquity the love of God shall wax cold brother Brandon you must be born again he talks about the rainbow after that comes from agape love to fill your love that's the love that you have for your wife if some man would insult her you'd shoot his brains out see because it creates a jealousy now look it creates a jealousy okay formulates creates a jealousy it creates all these things that you really don't need but watch because it creates a jealousy but that's filial love or secondary love then comes lust for another man's wife then comes filth see it just becomes perverted but all of this kind of love had a beginning so all love had a beginning is epigapee love Agape left can't be Eternal and have a beginning it's like I said before if God ever loved you he can never unlove you if he saw that you loved him he can't unlove you by the things that we do and that we we we like um I said many times before we spent a lot of time getting water baptized we spend a lot of time you know getting redone there's somewhere you're gonna have to put State down and say look I've had enough of that this is human error and mistakes it's going to happen I don't need to be baptized if I lose my temper if it did every one of you we'd have to baptize you every day I just have to stay up here and we'd be wrinkled by the time we got done sister Rebecca's laughing praise the Lord we won can we keep it separate there is a time when you better realize you need water baptism you better know that you need this Genesis 1 26 man but once you do there's a Humanity part that we live and this Humanity part that we live is human all right let's learn to keep it separate now watch this but then a real genuine love of God that I've been talking about come to the human being by the new birth now look it's not in there it comes in by the new birth being born again it it had no beginning and it'll never have an end you are then a Son of God and a daughter of God and your affections are on things above you stop that cussing stop it you stop all that other stuff feel your love would make you shoot a man for insulting your wife agape love would make you pray for his lost soul that's the difference the baptism of the Holy Spirit 1958 they come all the way down from Philly Love or agape love to feel your love and on down to lust and to the lowest and as we were talking this morning listen God can condescend and come and get you Satan's not going to that God himself became a man Jesus came down that same way to the lowest pits of hell picked out those who knew before the foundation of the world whose name was written on the book and redeemed them back to itself there you are the story of redemption cannot be fully known until we see him and we stand in his likeness it's really nice to know that Jesus was God but how much more nice is it to realize your God it's wonderful the world knows another maybe the second or third person or something that Jesus was God they don't know how to put it in there though but you and I know where to fit it out but we need to fit ourself in that too there you are the story of redemption cannot be fully known until we see him and we stand what in his Genesis 1 26. I hope some of y'all are praying well you got your eyes closed then sexually let's add Brotherly Love brotherly kindness now that's a good one right here six seven all right adding brotherly kindness when we get to brotherly kindness put yourself in his place on the matter that's a hard thing for us to do it's really hard for us to put ourselves in someone else's situation right right my brother sinned against me shall I forgive him talking to Jesus seven times oh Peter thought man I'm doing a good job uh Jesus said no 70 times that brotherly kindness now you see it for brother is All Out Of Tune don't be impatient with him see no see be kind to him go anyway somebody said not long ago how can you believe these things the way you do and still go to the Assembly of God the Oneness and all the rest then put see brotherly kindness hoping someday see patient with him so you got to use all these verbs you're patient with him temperate with him enduring with him having knowledge to understand what he believes I like to know what people believe I like for them to explain to me if you can't explain to me what you believe you really don't believe it remember because remember the quote where uh someone said you only really believe what you obey you only go obey what you believe in if you don't believe should come but that's contrary to the Bible very contrary to the Bible Antichrist well if it's not word what is it it's anti-word to you but let it go out with kindness meekness having faith that someday God will bring him in but I'm going to tell y'all something I'm gonna be a bearer of bad news here just for a second there's one day that God's going to finish that and he's not going to have any Mercy anymore do we not believe that are we just don't believe that we're just going what we're going to do is we're just gonna from the message it doesn't matter if we really get right uh we're just gonna flow right into the ark go right through the door and go right on into safety and I can do that because I've lost some weight [Music] no God said Noah I've had enough get in the ark that's right amen exactly and I'm sure listen Noah being a human he still had some friends out there that he said hey Lord just just give him a little more time gosh I give him 120 years he even give Grace he let it stay open for a few days then he shot it and when he shut it no one could open it so what am I saying well we're in the message so I think we're just going to morph into a change no you ain't gonna morph into a change you're gonna fight for every inch of ground I appreciate people that fight their way to church I can't stand people well here we go nevermind now here we are now in the in the New Testament everybody with me we're now in the New Testament all right the Old Testament you had a commandment right ten of them plus levitical law and all that but I'm gonna read you something in Leviticus in just a few minutes it may just like flip your switch a little bit but here Jesus is standing in John 13 34. now he's the new commandment so he says a new commandment I give unto you he's not erasing that commandment right he's magnifying it and telling you you can live it right because the Pharisees spent all their time saying you can't live it you got to come to us you got to do this you got to do that you got to wash the pot you got to light a candle you got to say you know 10 Hail Marys and all that stuff I'm bringing it up today listen the Catholic Church came from that Pharisee Spirit it was you when Jesus was here if you can't say that you're blind right it's not a different devil it's the same Devil in a religious organization that just brought it up to 80 300 8600 and I see you and just plopped it right down in the Christian church a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another now they were told that in the Old Testament as I have loved you that ye also love one another as I have loved you so the new commandment is it's not just love everybody as I have loved you you gotta love everybody else everybody with me look by this shall all men know that you're my disciples if you have love one to another remember we discussed it this morning disciple means discipline they were disciplined to what Jesus had told them Proverbs 25 this is the Old Testament if thine enemy be hungry give him bread boy that's contrary if he be thirsty give him water I'll bless God let him starve let him drown listen he's hitting all of us all right for Thou shalt Heep coals of Fire upon his head and the Lord shall reward you the best way to make somebody mad at you is do good to them oh they love road rage and they love for you to be in their face and you didn't argue or are you already are you because you just two Devils arguing with each other sorry I said two devil are you you're arguing back and forth right but if you say where was we at and we said if you say God bless you to somebody or have a blessed day some of people it's like you smack them in the head because they ain't gonna hear that they gonna hear all them other cussing that's what it's going to do though so then what do you do you transfer what was going to be on you you transfer it to that person your enemy I'm just over here I'm left-handed so I'm over here in front of you so my wife's sitting over there I can't go over there but what you're doing is you're heaping every bit of that that they're trying to throw on you if you don't back and forth right everybody with me can you see that you you and you see that when you start an argument with somebody just stop stop and say God bless you you have a good day and then turn around walk off it won't well it cause a fire on the head it's so inside if they just said one more thing well don't say that one more thing and it'll just Heap everything on his head and guess what the Lord said he would bless you for doing it did we not read that and the Lord shall reward thee Isaiah 42 verse 21 says the Lord is what this is Isaiah the Lord is well pleased for his righteous and his sake now remember in Isaiah 42 that would be in the Old Testament but it is speaking of and Jesus Through the different prophets in the New Testament he's going to say the exact same thing because he didn't do away he can't do away with the law he magnified the law a new commandment I give to you watch this right here and make it honorable Matthew 5 37. but let your communication for whatsoever is more than this cometh of evil you have heard that it's been said now wait a minute where'd they hear that where'd they hear that the hearing the synagogue they heard a preacher somebody poke you an eye poke him back because that's what the Old Testament says they knock your tooth out Knock theirs out and thank you your brother go kill him that was your old testament that was a levitical law right but what did Jesus come to do not to take it away but to make it little you have heard that it has been said an eye for a nine a tooth for a tooth but I say unto you this is the word this is at John 1 1 this is the word that has become flesh that's now talking to me and you but I say unto you that you resist not evil but what so whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek give them the other one if a man will sue you into law and take away your coat give him a cloak how many of y'all would do that didn't think so and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile well I'm tired I'm tired Jesus said go two miles this will if this will take care of the situation all right then we're good praise the Lord we're good no Jesus said just go another their mouth and make it more better made it where it hits the cold on top of their head give to them that asketh thee and from him that would borrow thee turn that thou away you know you're not supposed to according to the Bible you're not supposed to lend brother a brother money in that and get interest off of it you know you're not supposed to do that right that's not life lesson that's the Bible so you should never charge your neighbor if I'm or your brother if you let him if you loan somebody money don't charge them interest because the Bible tells you not to you've heard that it been said Thou shalt Love Thy Neighbor hold on man sue listen this I know we're gonna have a repentance party here in just a few minutes but all right the Bible says love your neighbor and hate your enemy and then what the Bible says the Old Testament says love your neighbor but hate your enemy but I say unto you now listen the person that's saying but I say unto you is this person right here remember this is still the New Birth the Genesis one man the the one that was not created that's Eternal that's that's that's not an offshoot of God it is God in another form called a bottle of water all right I heard the Genesis 1 26 this is the one that's talking everybody with me this is talk this came into human flesh 2000 years ago as a baby this was inside of that man right right what another person what now uh uh well Jesus wasn't God he was another person and he became god well I need to know where that other person's at then we got two or three persons we got a schizophrenic God and we don't need to serve him all right them we have one God he was born a baby he could do that but this was speaking because this when it comes into you has got to speak the same thing right that's why we've messed up down Through the Ages we've not listened to this we've listened to that Spirit realm that's wrapped all the way around this real tight because remember God can't tell you a lie God can't tell you an untruth God can't lead you into error so it's either the devil or him one of the two right all right Thou shalt Love Thy Neighbor y'all ready and hate that enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that cuss you in southern language do good to them that hey you know bless God I'll get them back by the end of the day you just wait and see if I don't um you're not at brotherly kindness yet you're not he said well if they were this this is a lot of y'all wait a minute y'all now if it's a Believer I forgive him yeah they go to little church I forgive them that's easy your neighbor don't go to this church now now wait a minute The Dales do but sorry so we're exam but most of your neighbors don't go to this church my neighbors are gay full blown for years 30 years they've been living together okay now I gotta look at them with the Same Love that God looks at me if not he can't look at me like you should be looking at me I told your brother all these others everybody's like oh praise God godliness that's good yeah we got some virtue we got some not oh man I'll get rid of that temper we're gonna have some well some we'll get rid of that I got patience now I got the patience of Job but like I love my neighbor as I do myself until for those of you that live way out in the country and don't have neighbors just consider it go put your paths a little bit wider somebody everybody's got a neighbor somewhere but I'm saying do you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you that's a hard one okay pray for me it's hard for me nobody said amen so pray for me and pray for them which despitefully use you listen this is somebody that's gonna use you in a spiteful way and persecute you look that you may be the children of your father your father produced this right here that you can be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth Reign on the just and the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward is that do not even the publicans do the same and if you salute your brethren only what are you more than others do not even Republicans do that also in other words Jesus is saying the normal this is the norm right here he don't want you to be the norm we got to rise above that oh then verse 48 after all this is be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect John 15 9 says as a father have to love me so have I loved you and continue ye in my love my agape if you keep my Commandments you shall abide in my love now we're fixing to give you the two best Commandments of of all the ten even as I have kept my father's Commandments and abide in his love these things have I spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full listen every time we come to a revelation you you all of us every time we come to Revelation you know what God's happy because something has bound you and he can't get to you but if it's revealed to you and you come out from that God can reveal more and then you're moving further and then because without Revelation we're nothing brother Brown said we thrive on Revelation because if you're if you're a backslid that means you ain't got anything revealed to you Revelation is continuing these things have I spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends Divine love 1956 brother Ryan said now we are faced in a day it's prophesied that Brotherly Love would become a strange thing among the people and it's to my humble belief that that is the greatest of all gifts that there is in God's Bible now this is 1956. he hasn't really got he's still in the healing campaign he's still preaching to Badness and Methodist and Pentecostals he hadn't really got to his message yet does everybody understand what I'm talking about all right he's getting us back to the day of Pentecost he's getting us back to what they already believed in the first church age but remember we left our first love in the first church age and the Lord Jesus would stand and platform tonight look me in the face and say I'm going to give you your choice in other words let's let's paraphrase this you can be a great person a great Minister I'll give you a gift gift to preaching he did all that I'll give you the gift of teaching I'll give you the gift of Divine Healing I'll give you the gift of Prophecy or I'll make you a prophet or any fine gift of faith any of the gift that's in the Bible now look how important he's fixing to put on this other thing any of the gifts that's in the Bible I'll give them ever one to you but then I will withhold love from you or either I'll give you love and withhold the gift I'd say Lord take all the gifts and let me have the love for no matter how many gifts we got they will never do us any good except the love of God is the motive behind the gift we must have agape 1957 I will restore Jesus spoke Paul did rather said let Brotherly Love continue that was in the first church but something taking place and there was a fellow came in by the name of Obama worm and when he began to eat on that vine of Brotherly Love he cut the very sight line of it because it don't make any difference how smart you are how much we think we know or how much we want to be different from somebody else as long as that brotherly feeling isn't among us we are fighting a losing battle that's right we can't win there's no way for us to win we all believe brother Brown was a prophet right and what he said we need to believe okay all right so let's continue on now let's talk about selfish to be selfish is to be what concerned excessively that's okay to take care of yourself take care of your house first but excessively or exclusively with oneself you're nothing but a selfie stick selfishness is one of the biggest obstacles to having the kind of close relationship with God and in an inspiring relationship with other people that many of us desire selfishness Cuts us off Galatians 2 verse 20 says I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live remember I preached several sermons on uh two lives because he said the life I now live which meant he was living a life before that but the life I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me Galatians 2 20. it teaches us that living by faith in the Son of God means you no longer live but Jesus lives in you this right here all right right so if we want to have a close relationship with God and other people you need to learn to leave yourself second Timothy 3 verse 2 it says for men shall be lovers of their own selves boy think about that Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthateful Unholy you know man's come to a place to where you know we used to make an honest living you go to work you'd work your hours you would produce something right you'd go to a building let's say we go to General Motors some of you work at the gym you go to gym you had all your parts there you you trusted that the this company would give you all the tools that you needed you would at the end of the day I think General Motors at one time was running um a car every minute so you were there was a car a minute going out big building 1200 people working you got all this equipment and they made money from that because they would take the like bro Danny would take the product put it together tangible ship it pack it ship it and go over here and somebody buys that right folks let me let you in a little secret when Facebook went public it was just an idea and a Man became a billionaire over just an idea these YouTube influencers that make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year that's all they are they talk online there is nothing they produce oh yeah up here but there's nothing tangible they don't go to work to a job they don't put something together and then sell it to somebody else they talk right mainly about their self YouTube influencer is that's what it's come to what what is that it's just the devil a farce of the devil he is telling you you can produce something and there's nothing there listen God will give you the parts got to give you the place to do it here and he'll give you the ability to do it but when you put something together what do you produce you produce a Christian Life and you take that product out to the world not a YouTube influencer the people has got too selfish that's what they're doing they're not going to work anymore they're going to say to how of course covet helped a little bit of that the people's got ten selfish got this go place where they think they live in a little world that's where I got the idea about the influencers because that's what it is it's all YouTube influencer does what talks about the world blog and make millions off of that off of talking gosh I should be a billionaire and people say amen people got too selfish they got the place where they think they live in a little world all by themselves you know that's the truth well you know it used to be out in the farm when we had a neighbor and the neighbor get sick we go help them do the work cut wood bring it in now you don't even know your neighbor's dead unless you read in the paper that's right selfish people pass down the street while we grab a hold of one another's hands shake their hands say how are you brother and today they pass on the street they give a little silly grin and that is right sister Esther sent me the the quote it was media that did that not brother Brown about four or five times in in the message so that's what he's referring to he's getting he's dishing his wife a little bit right here right and today when they pass on the street they give a little silly grin because that's what she said she said I grinned at them throw their head up in the air oh my no wonder the Love's gone I despise that old somebody feels they're bigger than somebody else after all you're six foot of Earth that's all you are that's right everybody 1954 and I recognized the other day a selfish Spirit coming upon me it's hard for people to swallow saying this man's wrong I ought to tell him about it he said that's wrong God's the one to tell him about it that's not none of my business but my business is to preach the gospel and love everybody move on love my enemies as Jesus loved me when I was his enemy do you remember that we were all enemies to God okay we're all the enemy of God so all in one boat but my business just preach the gospel of everybody move on love our enemies as Jesus Christ loved me when I was his enemy when I was unlovely he loved me to his bosom and anybody that's unlovely let me love them the same let the spirit that was in Christ be in US amen let that be our plea today is to be as loving as Jesus Christ is because I mean how many of you when you come to the Lord was in a real good shape think about it no use about in your lowest of low you had come to the end of your rope tied a knot and was hanging on or you've done something incredibly stupid that you couldn't get yourself out of that's when the Lord comes well guess what tell me that agape love is conditional is not conditional he loved you at the unlovable list that's the word part of your life and what did that love do he showed that love and it drawed you to it amen amen praise God that's the Revelation if you'll hang on to that look listen now 1954 brother Brown says now let us hold fast our profession of our faith without waver he's quoting scripture he is faithful who hath promised and let us consider one another to provoke one another unto love and to good work now listen a lot of us provoke other things praise the Lord every one of you word provoker but now the Bible tells us to promote one another into love and good work provoke means to what encourage we think not but it is encourage one another unto love and the good works if you see a brother in the church now watch there's got something against the other brother don't say something to stir that thing up how many secret centers have I hit there praise the Lord don't say something to stir that thing up but say something that'll bring them together provoke one another unto good works and to love is what we must do what is it that's a man that's born again if you my brother tonight don't feel that way when you see your brothers falling out in short words between one another if you don't feel like bringing them together it's your time to go to the altar right that's right there's something happened in your life there is something you've been deceived in you haven't the experience that God wants you to have for Jesus when he was reviled he reviled not again and with spoken evil of he spoke not back again and when they done evil to him he turned and did good to them when they persecuted him and nailed him to a cross he looked down and said father forgive him for they don't know what they're doing if that kind of spirit's not in you the Holy Spirit Holy Ghost has never entered you yet for that was the same spirit that was on Christ Jesus the Bible said let it be in you Christ is in his church that's a pretty powerful statement Hebrews 12 verse 14 says follow peace with all men and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and therefore many be defiled that goes to that quote that I just read you if a root of bitterness comes up brother Brian said what you need to cut it off you need help the brother instead of so we like to get a brother down and then beat him while he's down all right let's read what brother Brown said about some earning Church age 1960. the only thing the matter is got all these little differences away from you little isms little funny feelings around you for brother and things like that shake it away don't let no root of bitterness ever get into your soul if you do it'll conquer you right keep love I don't care how much people hate you love them anyway if you can't do that you ain't you the ain't you ain't sealed you got a loose place yet so come on on back and get that sealed up right good with the blood of Christ that'll cleanse you from all roots of bitterness yes Jehovah Jireh 1957. but Abraham the man of God gave lot his choice remember Abraham stood there and they stood on the mountain and they saw the Great Plain over here and it was really green grass but there was Sodom then you had all this other desert over here and Abraham didn't say now bless God a lot I'm I'm the one that started this thing okay I got you out and brought you with me which was wrong to begin with but Abraham thought he was doing a good job but he said now uh or he should have said like us like well well God spoke to me he spoke to me for then I spoke to you so so I so I get the green you can fight for yourself out there in the wilderness I mean in the desert okay no but Abraham the man of God gave lot his choice and took what was left oh I just love that a real believer will give you your choice he's willing to take what's left there's no selfishness and a real believer not at all right Romans 12 verse 9 says love be without dissimulation in other words strife and differences abhor that which is evil cleave to that which is good be kindly affection one to another with Brotherly Love in honor preferring one another Luke 6 verse 26 says woe unto you when all men speak well of you read in Bible for so did their fathers to the false prophets but I say unto you which here love your enemies do good to them which hate you bless them that curse you and pray for them that despitefully which means falsely accused which despitefully use you and to him that's modesty on One Cheek offering the other him that take away your cloak this is the part of the other scripture we read take that coat also give to every man that asks us of thee and of him that taketh away thy Goods ask them not again and as you would that man should do to you do you also to them likewise for if you love them which love you what thank have you for Sinners also love those that love them and if you do good to them which do good to you what thanks have you think of you for Sinners also do even the same and if you lend to them who you hope to receive ah ah boy that just beat us all right there upside the head don't tell me at a point in your life you give something wanting something in return yeah you have if you shake your head you're lying but it's hard to do is to give it with no strings attached right remember life lesson number 488 Dave Ramsey tells us don't ever let your kids borrow money from you right give it to them right because if you loan it to him he said Thanksgiving dinner does not taste the same with somebody sitting across the table that owes you money right and that's the truth all right and if you land on them of whom you hope to receive what think of ye for Sinners also lend to Sinners and receive as much again but love you your enemies and do good and lend hoping for nothing again and your reward shall be great and you shall be the children of the highest for he is kind unto thee unthankful and to the evil first John 4 19 says we love him because he first love us loved us if a man say I love God and hate us his brother he's a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he has seen how can he love God who is not seen and this commandment have we from him who God that he who loveth God loveth his brother also First John 3 verse 13 says Marvel not my brethren if the world hates you we know that we have passed from death into life because we love the Brethren he that loveth not his brother about us in death whosoever hate us his brother is a murderer and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him wow that's pretty strong there John hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren but who so hath this world's good and see if his brother have need and shuteth up his bowels of compassion from him how dwelleth the love of God in him my little children let us not love in Word neither in tongue but indeed and in truth first Peter 3 verse 8 says finally be all of One mind having compassion one of another love as Brethren be pitiful be courteous not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing but contrary wise blessings knowing that you are there unto called that you should inherit a blessing for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no guile Mark 11 24. therefore I say unto you want things whatsoever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them and when you stand praying forgive if you have awed against any he didn't say your favorite if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive you your trespasses folks that's Divine forgiveness because you can forgive the hardest part is going to be you forgive somebody you're still going to remember it and it may eat at you if you let it but thank God when God forgives you it's divine it goes in forget see if God forgiveness never to be remembered again but it bothers us because we see our faults and we see all the failures that we have but why don't we start looking at Christ inside the person but if you do not forgive neither with your father which is heaven forgive your trespasses in other words your prayers have stopped thank you you get no blessing until you forgive well I'll forgive them if they'll forgive if they'll if they'll come to me I I I I'm gonna just forgive him I'm gonna write it down put it in my Bible that that's that's um um that that seems like a holy thing to do I'll put it in my Bible or I'll put it near a prayer cloth no I ain't what it's there if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive you your trespasses so listen you're stuck God cannot speak to you until you get this taken care of why do we have problems many are weak and sickly among you in many sleep the Bible tells us why because we're not discern the body of the Lord Philippians 2 verse 3 let nothing not the vainglory but better than themselves perfect faith 1963. I want you to look at this I found this quote now faith is based on forgiveness then and we'll talk about that a little later why don't we get into it right now I just want you to see that faith is based on forgiveness I want you to kind of run that around in your head turn that to a Wednesday night faith is based on what forgiveness I just read you if you don't forgive God can't use your faith to forgive somebody else faith is based on forgiveness listen 1965 we'll close them uh come on musicians but because of the selfishness God among it the objective was wrong signing up a bunch of stuff it would be this way when they promised they would do it for the kingdom of God but looks like it was for themselves that's why I say you need to check your motive and objective because a lot of times we'll say oh this is the will of God this is what this is what God wants and I'm going to tell you something in this message God changes his mind more than any other religion there is right this is the will of God I'm supposed to do this and then two months later God changes his mind and something else happens oh I've seen it I don't know if you've seen it or not but we you better check your motive and objective because look it looks like it's for themselves you got a lot of self involved when you start making these decisions and it won't work no selfish thing will work your motives and objective has to be exactly perfectly right then you have faith to ask that's why faith is based on forgiveness you ever thought about that I hope you do now look if our hearts condemn us not all right then we have confidence but now look let's turn that around if our heart does condemn us we can't have confidence we can't have faith we've got to have confidence I want this to be the honor and glory of God then faith has a channel to move into if it doesn't then you got mental intellectual faith and not genuine Faith from God that intellectual faith will get you nowhere might get you emotional but it won't get you the healing that you're looking for we might be sick because we can't forgive I just read you every bit of that and that's all the whole summation of the whole thing we have a lot of problems because we can't forgive nobody let's stand I told you brotherly kindness is right up there I mean but listen if you break through it watch want much more are we going to get if we get it revealed to us that we've got this South cocoon that we're in and we're not going to let anybody in and we're not going to get out how are you going to display God in a cocoon how are you going to display God hiding him under a bushel like the Bible tells us take can't take the candle and put it under a bushel right you're supposed to take the cap off of it and let the let your what let your let me put it this way let your forgiveness shine same thing as life let your forgiveness shine let somebody say that oh he's the most forgiving person in the world everybody okay with that well no you're probably not I don't want an answer protects our life folks and it's right there where that Holy Spirit has got a you know what the Holy Spirit does and now down here he saves you right he saves you fills you with the Holy Ghost right all right puts you in service to work to let these virtues work when you get to that Holy Spirit up there at the top that ain't playing around that ain't a baby Christian that ain't not crying out by father that's somebody God is fixing to pour the oil on and it's going to seal you in as a unit then listen then God can really work with you the rain the Signet the adoption all the different things that's where God can work on you because we've got to come to that before The Headstone comes we're ain't talking about The Headstone when you talk about adoption and that's on two different things because they had that you know Paul different ones they were way up there brother Brown said the early church had all these gifts working or gifts or these uh virtues working in their life working in their life yet they did not have the headstone yet they were under a closed book what about us with an open book what a shame it is that we are who we are I'm talking about all of us that we're stuck in a cocoon of selfishness let's be unselfish let's give ourselves away let's sing a song God bless you [Music] I love him too much to fail him now to to break my back for I promise the Lord that I would make it somehow I could have him too much to face things we pray that you'd bless him and take care of him language to break my back or I promise the Lord that I would make it somehow I love him too much to fail him now love him too much to fail him now to too much to bring my vibe for I promise the Lord that I would make it somehow I love him too or give her wisdom Lord may she not even have to think in rehearse they would come to a certain place let the Holy Spirit come up out of our sister Lord deep down inside and may it speak the words Lord even though it may be harsh words but father may it be uh lavender with honey [Music] give her wisdom to do this Lord give her wisdom door to to speak to the Jenny Lord we know she's a sinner that needs you Lord and I pray Lord that you will touch her just touch her life and take that drinking away and all the different things Lord that she's hampered with and she's just she's just needs you Lord I pray that she'll just touch him now in Jesus name the whole family Lord amen amen just do that you just don't think just go just you know what it is just go [Music] thank you [Music] to fail him now and sometimes the circumstances that we've come upon Lord but we realize that you're in control and you said you would never put anything on us that we can't take father so I pray that you'd help my mother to realize Lord that this situation has not helpless and hopeless Lord that there's something good got to come out of this father I pray this should help my dad Lord that you would just strengthen Lord in his body and Lord in his mind father we pray these things Lord in Jesus name amen just believe that that's all you got to do thank you well she needs it real bad she needs it bad I know before I promise [Music] to fulfill him now there thank you Lord for saving my soul thank you Lord for making me hold [Music] thank you Lord for giving to me thy great salvation so pure and free [Music] thank you Lord for saving my soul thank you Lord for making me hold thank you Lord forgiving to me behold [Music] [Music] thank you Lord for giving to me like your grace [Music] amen I know it's kind of got a little hard with I knew brotherly kindness was going to be there's a few more things we need to bring out but but there's no greater feeling [Music] I told y'all and I'll tell you again I had I had to be raided a minister for for something he did which was none of my business and I held on to that for few years but one day I came to a realization that I wasn't going anywhere [Music] I mean it was just heavy [Music] heavy I mean like a load was on top of me because you know what it's just Rebecca I would I would I'd get a sermon give me a minute I'd get a sermon and I think man this is good everybody's gonna really enjoy they really enjoyed sleeping through it that was about all I got out of it the Lord let me go through that for a while [Music] always there was a little voice inside says you got to make that right [Music] now listen one thing about this whole situation is is God had enough confidence in me to tell me that if he didn't have any confidence he's not going to waste his voice and tell you you need to do it foreign but I'll promise you you talking about a load being lifted by just picking up the phone and calling the brother and say look man I'm sorry I said something against you that you did of your own accord and it was your business and I didn't have any business talking about your business [Music] and he said brother wait he said you're forgiving he said won't you come preach for me but you're talking about when I hung that phone up you talking about feeling clean you know you get out get out I'm not saying the rest of you not workers but Donnie gets in and he gets Grime all over him and he's got you know he's got soot and and tar and and oil in places he shouldn't have it because he worked all day he got into his job and boy what a nice thing she was like in the shower right same way with all of us Jim's like you've been in the garden all day take a shower but don't you feel refreshed when you do it no matter how tired you are you get in that shower and you left a water run you just kind of you know you sing a little bit and you kind of let the water and you you massage yourself with that's what you give soap for is and massage yourself with you know that it's not the cleanest just to massage you anyhow but uh don't you feel good you're feeling you know brother Gary different one you got sawdust in his ear and he got sawdust in his hair and Julie's like nope go shower and you go take a shower and you feel so clean well that's how I felt when I got off the phone with that brother and then I would then you know what I went on with the Lord I made it through that hurdle it's not just saying I mean me you got to do the same thing I'll promise you but now listen here's the sad part if you're not his child he won't condemn you right [Music] remember you're a bastard child he ain't got to take care of you he has no he only his Genesis 1 26 kids so if you say now come on throw tomatoes at me please if you say oh that don't bother me you're not born again why'd you stop playing Tomatoes at me or what but now listen you're not because there's nothing in there to bounce off of to live this right here how many you tell me how many people in the world that's not born again can live what I just preached today not one to the T but he's made it where we can cause he's a good daddy that will bring these to your remembrance oh we like for him to bring the good things to our remembrance yeah but what about the things he says hey you're not going any further till you get that right it's going to hinder you until you get it right but all when you get it right what has he done he's taken that rapper off and now you can move to the next thing and now you can move to the next thing now you can move to the next phase of your Christian Journey but I promise you you won't move until you get to a place to where you can forgive and not expect something in return I didn't expect the brother Dave to to you know I knew what he would do I knew he would forgive me [Music] but I had to hear it for myself I had to get it clear with me was it for him nope it was for me he probably never thought a word about it because he never heard what I said but when I told him he said well bless God you shouldn't have nothing out I'm gonna hang up on you well that would have showed who he was but he said brother wait he said don't worry about it he said I forgive you he said now come preach for me what happened yeah but I will I've never been I haven't been up that way in a while so but uh it just made but then it makes you feel a lot better though let's don't carry these weight what the Bible say these weights that so easily beset us can you run better with your pound pack on your back or with nothing on your back you can run a lot better with nothing on your back well if you carry the load out that door don't get it right it's a 50 pound bag of junk on your back that you know what you're doing you're carrying it you're carrying it selfishly because you're saying they need to come to me or I don't have to really do that but who are you heaping coals on then you're heaping coals on yourself take that thing off let's give it away take care of it there's there's one way to do it and that's to forgive and be forgiven brotherly kindness that's the love for the Brethren and that's true love that's not filial love that's agape love let's bow our heads thank you Lord for this day you've given us thank you for even giving us a chance to forgive and be forgiven Lord you died to give us a chance to be forgiven and Lord we come to that and we see that you saved our soul and then we got to start work on the next guy the memory reasoning conscious Ness affection and Imagination and Lord we got to start getting those flus cleaned out so that we can be as the prophet said a living instrumentality of God with no flu stopped up Lord I pray that the 50-pound bag will be lifted from us today Lord it by us seeing you and others and even though we don't see you in Others May others see you and us father forgive us of our sins and our mistakes Lord that we make we ask your blessings on the people on they leave on the highways be with the ones that are sick again Lord we we pray the return of the ones that are gone and Lord give us our daily bread be with us next weekend with Brother Richard Lord and brother Mike Lord keep them strong and and give us a good time in you father and just bless us now and take care of us in Jesus name amen you're dismissed now remember
