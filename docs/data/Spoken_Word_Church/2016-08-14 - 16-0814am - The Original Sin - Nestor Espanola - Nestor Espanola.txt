the house of the Lorden and it's uh I'm glad to be [Laughter] here yeah is such a great blessing for from the Lord to allow me to pass by in your place and for the pastor to allow me to stand behind this Pulpit yeah it's always uh like the prophet said you know the pastor is the most suspicious person on Earth yeah because he wants to protect the flux and that is really his responsibility praise God and to lead you know uh like I say uh even in our church see God gave the pastor the overseer for the soul of the people amen praise God so you can have a God can bless you with so many things God can bless you with a big mansion houses a car a lot of money in the bank good health praise God but to have a good church and a good Minister it's I can say that it's a double blessing amen praise God so so be very thankful to the Lord uh if we have a a nice uh place to worship and Minister um to help us to grow in in faith that's all what the ministers want to do praise God it's also in my heart I just want to be a blessing am praise God anywhere I go I said um the only motives that I have is people to go into the Rapture amen see that's all I want praise God and anybody who who can do it then let him do it like the prophet said help them support them you know praise God see that's why uh like I say if everybody have that kind have that um thing in their heart we have no problem right praise God because even God he is not happy for the uh for the loss for The Sinner to lost their soul praise God so same thing with us that's why as much as possible as long as we can uh as long as we live there is a breath in our body we will try praise God see to do what we can also you know praise God hallelujah and this church I was uh I'm thankful for this church this is very supportive amen praise God when it come to the mission field see like I say even in our church you know it's only a privilege from the Lord that the Lord allow us that the Lord trust us to go into the mission field that's right see and help in the mission field amen praise God not everybody okay praise God not everybody uh can join see even even in the Old Testament you can see it a lot of a lot of nation wants to help Israel to build the temple but they were not allowed see every body can carry the art see but they were not allow see praise God it was only given to a certain people praise God and so this this burden is also given to the certain people praise God see to go out amen I'll just want to give you um a brief report on what's happening in Southeast Asia I hope uh we that be all right amen amen praise God so that you uh I know brother uh way updating you on uh praise God on what's happening there H Allelujah so I'm I will just review it amen praise God hallelujah okay brother amen so we have this scripture and everybody knew it and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature praise God hallelujah he that believeth and is baptized shall shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damed praise God so this is the commission that we are praise God everybody has a part praise God remember that not only the minister all of us even our elderly brother and sister that's right see sometimes this uh elder brother they said oh that's that's for the young uh young ministers only or for that only for the minister that still can uh go and uh fly and go out you know praise God remember this in the time of brother Branham there is one Minister approach him a young Minister he said you know brother Branham see if only my grandma is still alive she will be very happy because he's all she's always praying for me to be saved but now I'm not only saved I become a minister right right you know brother brother Anam told him you know boy why you are why you are a minister today why you are become the God's Min God servant today because it is your grandma's prayer right see praise God that's why this grandma grandpa praise God don't tell me oh I'm old I cannot do I will just go to the church hey you still have a part in the mission field amen praise God you need to pray pray praise God in in in in in Mission field there is no such thing as expiry date see it's only in medicine and uh you know and and in the Walmart but in the mission field there is no expiration date okay praise God do your part because praise God When you pray even in like the prophet said in the Bible it is also written even though if we pass away our prayer is still in front in the presence of the Lord until that prayer is fulfilled that will linger in the Throne of God Amen praise God so help us in prayer praise God hallelujah so next so this is what's happening so this is what we always do in in uh uh doing um um seminar with the Laos Minister Laos is a very strict communist they are still poor country you know when China is still poor when you know we know it communism they hate religion any kinds of religion see we know the fism naism but it is only that one ISM that really hate religion and that is communism to them com uh religion is poison see praise God so uh when China is still poor they are very strict but when their economy went up they become a little bit lenient so same thing with Vietnam when they are still very poor but now their economy is rising up and then Laos is still a very poor country see if I will go there they won't even allow me to stand behind the pulpit see even just to greet the people no Foreigner is allow right see so what's the use of going in there praise God one time we do Bible study in Laos you know one first day you you have no problem see but the SEC first day when the neighbors saw there's so many people going into that house see they may they might say oh maybe they have some occasion but if you do it on the second day then the neighbor is obligated see to report you to report it into the security to the police and then now in the third day you better run fast see so you I cannot accomplish many things you know doing that so that's why I try to invite them and uh go into into the border of Thailand I will show it to you later praise God so there is where we have our seminar for uh 3 days see and we book in a hotel next see praise God next see so that's how we do it it's in in in one of the hotels room okay we cannot use the same hotel at the uh more than three times we keep on jumping M see because the you know they are also being followed being monitored see it's a little bit expensive because if you're talking about 10 ministers to inviting them to come out of their country praise God see just paying for their VIs $30 each if you if you have 10 you're talking about 300 see praise God just paying the Visa then they need to travel you know praise God so if you're talking about $40 each then you have already 400 see that's already 700 see so these are poor Minister remember praise God I came from a poor country I know it see if you invite them for 3 Days imagine for 3 days you know they work a day and eat a day yeah see praise God I hope you understand it this our Minister we we are not happy just to send them okay you go home I give you the word see yeah they also have a stomach they also need to eat that's right see praise God whatever left I give it to them so I easily spend $8,000 I'm just trying to share it to you so you will understand because we need more ministers to go there praise God [Laughter] so you know how much see praise God then you need to book the hotel praise God then you need to feed them for 3 days but look when there are 10 mins coming out you are talking about six churches at least six churches you're dealing with six churches praise God and you have three days Bible study and in the 3 days sometimes we can have a uh in the first day we have two service and the uh second day we have three or four service and then on the third day you know they need to go back home because that's the only see we we have at least six to seven meeting see and here praise God dear brother Craig Boer from Al Lima Ohio praise God I ask him to come because I'm getting old see we need we need we need the the the mission field to go on okay praise God here uh we have this question and answer praise God after the service that's better you know you can because it is no use to go into that country and and and and uh you know preach in their church when the past even when even the pastor don't understand what the message is so it's better to share the gospel to this message to the pastor first and now we keep on baptizing and these ministers that's coming from Laos I tell you they accepted the says they were baptized in the message and they are being persecuted because of the message see one brother he was kicked out of the church I think I tell you that is uh testimony when I was here before praise God see he was kicked out of the church he was also kick out of the village just is standing for this message praise God and the problem we cannot build Church in Laos I don't know what will happen because uh they are too strict see but we have many ministers now they keep on uh preaching this uh uh message you know keep on re baptizing people that's why even this denomination evang Laos Evangelical Church they were uh uh how do you say shaken or they were now afraid of them because people they keep on baptizing you know but they cannot stop them people are asking why what's the problem they are only sharing the Bible see praise God so so keep them in prayer okay next praise God H Allelujah so this is where we are working praise God that is the United States so praise God this is uh this is the southeast Asia Next see so this is the next southeast Asia so this is where I'm working Burma Laos Thailand Cambodia Vietnam see so if you will notice Cambodia see is this is very strategic because a four country is connected with this with this uh uh with this country so Vietnam we have the message in Vietnam for so long but they still praise God I can say very very weak okay praise God and here we Danny is now working in this area brother Danny delmundo because uh you know he's working now in in Myanmar and also in in in Japan and this is the Philippines praise God see next praise God so this is Thailand this is Laos next so this is Ching Rai this is where I I took the ministers to go out to come out see it's in the in the boundary of Thailand Thailand is a free country you can do what you want to do praise God so it's better you know praise God see we can have a service for the whole day as long as you want praise God there is no problem with them praise God see next next so this is Vietnam so this is Thailand this is Laos so this is where we we meet the Laos ministers so the Vietnam also the Vietnamese ministers next so this is Cambodia this is Vietnam Next see so this is the where we meet the Laos ministers next so this is the Vietnamese ministers we I also to gather them in Cambodia because Vietnam is also a communist country though they are a little bit lenient but I do not want to take a chance that's right okay praise God see it's better to save God's servant right than save the money see you can earn the money but I don't know what will happen to me if I got caught in Vietnam see they uh several Minister message minister they were being they got caught you know even uh Ron Peterson and several other from New Zealand and they were arrested and you know the Vietnamese people the Vietnamese government they will not uh they will not kill you they just want the money yeah see if I got arrested they will they are they will ask 10,000 us yeah see what will happen to me I have eight children see I don't want to you know see if if I take them out here yeah we spend more see we spend around 2 to 3,000 us see because a lot of them will come you know this Vietnam is a big country look praise God see if you if you are talking about 20 to 25 ministers to come out praise God you're you you talking about sometimes uh some of them will travel from here to come here it will cost them $100 right see praise God so it's a little bit expensive like like I say it's a little bit expensive praise God see but to me um we can accomplish more if we deal with the minister see praise God but today you know yes sir uh this this is a little bit expensive see compared to Laos see that's why now what I am trying to do I will just go go here in Danang somewhere here see praise God and there is a there is a Christian Hotel see praise God so I we've been doing this for almost 3 years you know for the Vietnamese believer see uh what happened when I when we went there uh they keep on translating the message but they don't have the books I said how can you study without the books he said oh we uh we can listen to the message I said my goodness there is no no school still that were uh that were in invented that the people can can learn just by listening okay there is no such school yet okay praise God Amen see so I we try to print the books see uh some before the brother from New Zealand they're helping but then uh the economy something happened to the Pacific island now the brother from Canada uh brother Eugene Brown see they are sending uh we can only print books to books four books in a quarter see before we can print four books in one month but today it down to four books in three months see so you see the shortage you know praise God see so now this is what's happening see next praise God see so maybe next time praise God when I go there I will just deal for five Minister because we are doing it for almost three years is spending a lot of money see so I talk to brother the brother IND Danang 111 ministers there when I went there last time I cannot even go to the church see the pastor even even he they even want me to preach he said brother Nestor this place our place is very small see and all of us are being monitored if you come to the church everybody will be in trouble right and I don't want to do it so when I went there we just have the lunch and then they said and one brother said the place that you're staying is a Christian you know the owner is a Christian you can do the seminar there I said okay next time that is I think that is what we need to do because that Pastor told me you know he said you know brother Nestor I've been in the me I hear this message for so long more than 10 years but when you hold that seminar in in in Cambodia that really make it clearer to me okay so when I went to China I just want to give you a testimony you know how see the Chinese people they are very industrious they will read the message when they read this the seven Church ages they read it seven times M see they they can almost memorize it yeah because they thought reading it so many times will make them understand but they cannot understand right see when I went there for two days see they put me in hotel they book me there you know so they come one by one one by one then sit there praise God when they are when they all gathered together I will go out of my room they they they they book A A big one you a sweet you know praise God so they can gather outside the uh outside the room my room see I start sharing it to them the seven Church ages the the Catholicism you know and just for 2 days they they were say why it's so easy to understand right see praise God like I say you know we need the fivefold ministry praise God if the mission work is uh printing the books making the tapes and this if that is the mission work then we need just to find the rich people brother see don't don't need to send this uh five full ministry right praise God just look for a rich people and print the books and you know those were tools okay I'm not against it I need it those were the tools but we need the fivefold ministry amen praise God even in the in the Old Testament remember Philips in the unic see that unic he was a smart man say he keep on reading the Bible you know during that time those the only only person that can read the Bible is those who are educated right see praise God but he cannot understand he said how can I understand when nobody explaining it amen amen and God sent this uh nobody to him to sh to show it to him so same thing praise God hallelujah see so this brother when he told me you know brother Nestor uh it become clear to me it touched my heart see because I do not want to do the seminar anymore because I told them I've been doing it for so long you know and too much money okay praise God too much money is is is is involved praise God see and uh you know okay BCF help a lot okay but you know the problem praise God their mission fund went down praise God see so I that's why I'm trying um you know other church I tell I'm inviting these young ministers also join the field join the field you know praise God I can do so much everybody can do so much like brother Dale said you know Sam said you know we can do we can do this much this brother can do this much praise God I I can only tell you I did my part okay praise God see so next time I said maybe uh we will I I will do the same thing like I do here praise God see so next Allelujah see just uh inviting five five or six ministers so it will be it a little bit cheaper see so this is how we do the seminar next praise God see so this is this is in Cambodia okay next these are CH uh these are Vietnamese and this is the Cambodian minister so we gather two country in that one next in that uh in that one area we have a mission house in in uh in Cambodia we use it to uh to store the message book at the same time when we try to gather this Minister praise God see next Allelujah so this this is you know when I come into Vietnam this is what they have in a big folder mhm see I said no I love the message amen it to me that is the most precious treasure on Earth that God gave to the bride amen see praise God we need to do it right right we need to do it make it very uh you know I'm not saying make it very expensive but at least presentable when you give it to the person to the people people they will not just throw it see they will uh you know when they look at it oh they they they will going to have a hard time to throw it because it's so nice right so this is what we are we are doing praise God see we print we print it praise God next Hallelujah see so this is now Cambodia okay praise God next so we have this next so Laos and then the and the and the Vietnamese see next praise God so now this is Cambodia next this is ponen this is the capital of Cambodia so this is where our uh mission mission house is next see so this is where we hold the meeting next next next mhm next next so now next we are inviting several Minister now Pastor Samuel he is now pastoring the church there amen we ordain him praise God we do this seminar in Cambodia for so many years see for so many years I think two or 3 years we baptized almost 30 denominational ministers they always come to this to this place now this time we decided to go into their church amen since they know what what we stand for they know if we will go to the church we will preach this kind of message amen see praise God about the Holiness about the woman preacher about the prophet they know it see so I I'm not hesitant see to preach there anymore because they know where we stand okay praise God see so this are this brother Daniel while he is from uh Australia and this you know him right brother Steve Alis from churchy Spencer see we we are trying to encourage brother Young Brother to come you know praise praise God say join the mission field join the Southeast Asian Mission field like I say that is the most neglected Mission field of all the mission field see everybody wants to go to Africa they want to go to India they want to go to South America but the prophet said just find the native and then support them help them you know and let them evangelize do it fors see there are so many good ministers in Africa see that's why I said how come that they all everybody wants to go there see when those African ministers are much better they are so good you know same thing with the with the Indian you know praise God hallelujah see I'm not I'm not telling you not to go there anymore okay but I'm I'm just trying to tell you praise God that's true give more time right where we need more missionary okay praise God give more time praise God H Allelujah next see so now uh lately you know brother Craig Boer from uh Lima Ohio you know so when he when he talked to me last year during the North Carolina camp meeting he said brother Nestor see I want to help help in the in in your Southeast Asian Mission field what is the immediate need I told him you I don't need the money okay I don't praise God see you and he was surprised I said brother come please you know I don't know how how much years uh you know if the Lord will t 10 more years 20 more years I don't know if I can still go out after 5 years okay praise God see so he he came with me last time praise God and everybody was blessed next praise God see so this is the book that we store in this Mission House praise God see that is the pastor this is the Evangelist you know they are all young that's why I've been telling you to the people just give them five more years you you there will come out a very strong Church in Cambodia we need one more model Church in Southeast Asia so I show you Vietnam Thailand Laos Cambodia then Myanmar but there is no model Church in that in that place see praise God I'm praying now there are five of them see all of them are young people and one sister and now next month two are coming praise God next praise God see so this is Cambodia this is the capital next praise God next see so now praise God we went we went to the churches now see the first place that we went is Kong Chang next see so this is this this man he is a pastor of denominational church he is the pastor in this church next see so this is the brother that accepted the message he was re baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that Pastor is trying to that Pastor is trying to invite him and giving him the position of the associate pastor see because he got more people than this pastor but he does not want to join him see he said see when we went to his place next next so so this is the pastor next this is his house under underneath it next see this is where they hold the fellowship see praise God so the pastor is inviting him to join them and giving him the position of the associate pastor he said I cannot accept him I cannot accept it because if he will accept it he will be caged right yeah see he knows it he will I will be CAG you know I will see because every time you share the gospel he Shar the message to the church see the pastor keep on raising his hand trying to stop him see that's why he said I don't feel good pastor see so now when he said that praise God what are we going to do that is the next question what are we going to do are we just going to sit there and

that's what's happening in the in in in Southeast Asia then in the Philippines so pray for it praise God hallelujah amen hallelujah so now we go into our subject this is uh this very familiar that's why uh I think uh we can do it very fast amen can we all stand up and read the scripture amen so we know this this is the original scene say I want to tackle the mystery in the Garden of Eden and the Mystery in the ark praise God see this is how one of the major doctrines in the message amen praise God next praise God so just follow me brother praise God you can see the scripture there I I will just read it into my laptop and just follow me and just keep on changing this light amen so another Parable put he forth unto them saying the Kingdom of Heaven is liken and to a man which saw good seed in his field but while man sleep his enemy his enemy came and saw tears right among the wheat and went his way but when the blade was sprung up and brought for fruit then appeared the tears also 27 so the Servants of the householder came and said unto him sir did not thou so good seed in thy field where Dan then had it tears he said unto me an enemy had done this the servant said unto him will thou then that we go and gather them up but he said nay lest while ye gather up the tears ye root up also the wheat with them let them both grow together until the Harvest and in the time of harvest I will say to the Reapers Gather ye together first the tears and bind them and bonders them to burn them but gather the weed into my burn into my barn see may the Lord add the blessing from the reading of his scripture you all may be seated praise God see Hallelujah keep going see now the parable see now Jesus is trying to explain to them the parable here in verse 36 then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and his disciples came unto him saying declare unto us the parable of the tears of the field he answered and said unto them that he that swe the good seed is the son of man amen amen see the f is the the world yep the good seed are the children of the Kingdom but the tears are the children of the wicked one the enemy that sth them is the devil the Harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the angels as therefore the tears are gathered and burn in the fire so shall it be in the end of the world the son of man shall send forth his Angel and they Shall Gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquity and shall cast them into the furnace of fire where where there there shall be wailing and ning of teeth then shall the righteous shine forth as a son in the Kingdom of the father who had ears to hear Let Him hear see so every time Jesus give a parable he also explain the parable see sometimes praise God people you know we just read it we just we just read it like passing by you know but then here's come the minister that's why there is nothing new what on what we are trying to teach it's always there amen it's always there praise God see Hallelujah you know the prophet said sometimes you teach this subject it will just go on on the head over the head of the of the listener see the next time it will hit the head the next time it will hit the heart see amen praise God see maybe it is uh it will just uh you know Brother Sam and brother way you know they are a good teacher okay praise God remember we do believe in the fivefold ministry they can do they can do such thing I can do this thing you know don't try to look from me what your pastor has okay and then and don't try to look at your pastor what I have Okay then if I say something different from your pastor charge it to my ignorance okay praise God listen and follow your pastor praise God hallelujah see remember praise God see if you if if you saw that your pastor is a man of God you need to respect him we need to respect him okay praise God pray for him praise God hallelujah see praise God see so if you have some question don't approach me talk to your pastor okay and and listen to him amen praise God I believe you know I believe you have a good pastor praise God see so sometimes you know uh like the prophet said sometimes there is a big man that can see in the hole but he can carry the small man and the small man can look over the fence okay praise God that's all we want to do praise God see sometimes when when when people are describing one place they can only see the this side some can see this side some can see the other side but if you will try to connect everything then you can you can see the whole view of the house amen right praise God see so the original sin next praise God this is the mystery in the Garden of Eden see praise God see we need to know it because everything came out from the book of Genesis all the problem started in the Book of Genesis see you know that's why the prophet said there are two books that the de that the devil does not want you to understand the Book of Genesis and the Book of Revelation see praise God see he wants you to talk about in the middle of the Bible see but the but the the the the Genesis and Revelation he does not want you to understand it that's right amen okay praise God see Hallelujah now next so this is what the the the terms from the Matthew there is a so see there is the seed there is the field there the Harvest Time and the Reapers see it said praise God there is the owner who saw yeah see the owner see he saw seeds and it's a wit seed praise God on the field while he slept another come in the enemy it says the enemy he saw another tear another seed and that is the tears praise God then Jesus said you know the owner that is the son of man that is the Lord Jesus Christ that is the Lord God Amen praise God and the enemy none other is said than the devil see and he said the we they are the children of the kingdom and the tears they are the children of the wicked one see so if you will notice praise God see there are two kinds of people on this earth right one is a children of God one is the children of the devil see whether you believe it or not praise God see even the scripture said it next praise God he says here in John 3:10 in this that children of God praise God hallelujah see the children of God are manifest in the children of the devil whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God neither he that love not his brother next in John 8:47 he that is of God heareth God's word ye therefore hear not because ye are not of God see you can we can see it there are two kinds of people on this Earth see the children of the devil and the children of God Amen see the children of God will always listen to the word of God amen glory see praise God the children of the devil praise God see whatever we you know how much we share to them we cannot do anything about it okay praise God see but we are not in the position to judge anybody that's or you will say oh maybe it's the children of of the devil no don't do it that's right okay praise God say as much as possible put it in your heart that everybody it seems that everybody can be saved see but we know not everybody can be saved but we need to have that in our heart that Compassionate Heart don't lose that in your heart once you lose that compassion in your heart you are done you're are finished amen praise God see next see so this is the plan praise God there are the children of God they are the children of the devil he says the field is the word and the Harvest time is the end of the world and the reapers are the Angels see even Jesus is trying to tell to the people that there is an end of the world see praise God you know that's why all the scientist now is trying to go to the Mars planet Mars you know who wants to go there see praise God hallelujah that's that's that's the farthest that a human knowledge can do right see they know they know it the right place to escape from this distraction is to fly see praise God God knows it see that's the only way is to fly right that's why we sing that song I'm fly away to Glory I'm Fly Away amen by and by you know when you don't see me anymore I Fly Away amen hallelujah they know it see praise God but they just do not want to accept the way of God see they have their own way see so in this world the original plan of God next so if this is the world the original plan of God next is to just have sons and Daughters of God that's the that's the that's the original plan but something happen next the children of the devil appear right see now we have two classes of people now on Earth amen right see the Son of God and the son of the devil see praise God whether you like it or not that's the Bible praise God and you can see it around you right if you don't believe see a lot of people believe that everybody is a son of God no how how can the Son of God drink beer drugs committing adultery gambling smoking no they are not see praise God hallelujah they are sons of the devil amen amen see I that's why I always tell you you know praise God it's free to go to heaven that's why uh one brother told me brother nestar always want to get everything free I said yes because that is scriptural [Laughter] that is scriptural see it's in the Bible I'm legalist when it come to free you know if you want to go to hell you need to pay right you need to pay more you need you need young people you need to buy makeup see you need to uh pierce your ear by earrings by eyes Shadow uh you know buy beer marijuana is smoking drinking you need to pay it that is not free right and it's expensive drugs is expensive praise God see Hallelujah and that is your payment to Hell Hallelujah and you cannot you cannot borrow it you need to pay it in cast Hallelujah see praise God Hal Hallelujah see that's why we like I love free okay see now we need to go okay how these things happen where how this the Son of God and the son of the devil how how these things happen you know so we need to go back in the SE chapter the Book of Genesis amen praise God the book of Genesis come from the root word Jin see it means seed next praise God see praise God see Genesis now it says here in verse three in in verse 1 and two now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yeah had God said You shall not eat of every tree of the garden so that's why I've been telling it to the people you know look if you believe the Bible the serpent can speak it can speak right that's the Bible he talked to the woman see praise God the serpent is not a snake see praise God hallelujah that's why when I went to Vietnam when I went to Myanmar you know they are translating the message and then when I uh when when I was with a a Vietnamese minister so when I when I read this scripture I I said to that the translator do you know that translator is the very key when you're going out of the mission see praise God when I read this quote then I I stopped him I said okay tell them that the serpent is not a snake he said no but the Bible said it's a snake yes it's a snake but tell it the Bible write it that way but the serpent is not a snake no he said it's in the Bible okay that's right it's in the Bible see PR praise God then I told him okay the King James Bible say it's a serpent but when you translate it to any language it will not give you serpent it will always tell a snake yeah right see even in our Bible any Bible because it's a mystery right amen see it's a mystery see praise God Only The Prophet revealed the serpent is not a snake yeah amen okay so I tell I tell that to them okay now that's look if that is a snake it can speak yeah see one it can speak see and it's in the garden and that's open his eyes you know oh oh yeah he said yeah okay so he explained further see to tell it to the people because that is the key you know they need to understand that the serpent is not a snake praise God if you don't understand Genesis what happened in the Garden of Eden you're lost everything happened there and it will reveal even the godhead see why Jesus need to be born out of sex why why is the Virgin bird why Blood everything everything is in the Book of Genesis see sir praise God so the serpent talked to the woman and the woman speak to him also he said he said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden see so verse two it says they can eat all the fruit right in the Trees of the garden so she's referring to the Garden of Eden okay now in verse three but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden now there's another Garden the midst of the garden see praise God but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God had said ye shall not eat of it neither shall you touch L you die and the serpent said unto unto the woman you shall not surely die but for God do know that the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as Gods knowing good and evil see so remember what did Satan wants to be he wants to be equal with God he do not want to be up above God he just want to be like God see praise God see so this is the same thing that she offered to the woman that she will be like God see praise God hallelujah yeah then and when a woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and the tree to desire to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat see so it tempted the woman and the woman took the fruit and she ate it then after eating it she gave it to his husband and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they s fig lips together and made themselves aprons see praise God now next so these are the three major character the serpent Adam and the woman praise God they were always you know like the prophecy truth were always overlooked see hallelujah praise God that's a problem now okay so what really happened in the Garden of Eden yeah so the serpent offered to the woman to be like God remember that is our key word to be like God Amen so now here next now when this thing happened God was angry with the serpent so he cursed the serpent he cursed the woman see but not Adam okay praise God see Hallelujah now even in the or we have what we call the you know some uh cases it can you know there is no Witnesses right like a murder or rape there is nobody will rape somebody with a witness see how can you prove it right how can you pin the suspect it's through circumstantial evidence okay so same thing because uh you know people are asking how these things happen Okay let's look at the circumstances see Hallelujah and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou H has done this Thou Art cursed above all cattle see so again the Bible said the serpent is not a snake it is like a cattle and above every beast of the field so he is on the field upon thy belly so that is the time that the serpent crawl shall go and thus shalt thou eat all the days of thy life see and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed see so something happen that has a connection with the seed see he said to the serpent your seed and her seed the woman seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shallal bruise his heel that's right see praise God hallelujah next unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee see praise God and to the woman he said now you are going to give birth y see that's why it is not a normal thing for the woman to give birth right this is that is not a natural thing so something happened that has something to do about giving birth see praise God look at the cow the cattle when they give birth you don't you don't bring them to the hospital right see praise God but to a woman my goodness Hallelujah you do a lot of things you know just when the baby come out you know you need to do something a lot of things but when they cutle when they when what do you call that small cow see when it come out you just you just look watch it and look it until it stand up and then you clap your hands but you cannot do it to a baby you let it alone it will die because it is not a normal thing right for the woman to give birth remember that this is not a normal thing so something happened praise God praise God and it has something to do with the bird it has something to do with the seed praise God see and unto Adam he said because thou has hen unto the voice of thy wife and has eaten of the tree of the which I commanded thee saying Thou shalt not eat of it curse is the ground for thy sake in sorrow Thou shalt eat of it all the days of thy life see so God did not create us to work praise God see that's why it's always in the father's in the parents heart see to work for their children praise God they want to earn a lot of money money in that way their children no need to work see praise God because God did not create us to work that's why even if you earn a lot of money today you're working there is a time that you do not want to earn money anymore right even how much they give you I'm tired because it is not normal to us to work okay something happened that we need to work okay I'm not telling you to become lazy see no work no itat okay remember that praise God hallelujah see praise God see but it is not a normal thing to us see praise God God did not create us to suffer remember that he is our father praise God no no father here that he wants his his children to suffer praise God hallelujah if any if if if you know if there is some if there is a suffering the parents want to carry it for their children see praise God that is the very responsible parents remember that Hallelujah see now okay so this is the keyword next see so now see we know wait okay the Bible is written you know sometimes is parabolically symbolically metaphorically and some time we say it it's a natural spiritual okay so now praise God we are dealing here in the Book of Genesis see if I say natural if I say spiritual you know in Matthew chapter 4 Jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God so we have two kinds of food right so we have the natural food and we have the spiritual food see the bread we eat it naturally for our body right see we have a natural body then we have the spiritual food see the word of God that proceed out of the mouth of God see we do not come here every Sunday and tier one page okay praise God Genesis chapter 3 we're going to eat that next month H next week and everybody bring bring that page and eat it in the church no we don't do that when we are listening and we are reading we are already eating it right spiritually right see so now you understand when I say natural and spiritual okay next praise God so there is the garden see like I told you there is the Garden of Eden where all the fruit of the trees next praise God see where all the trees they have their fruit and you can eat it naturally MH okay praise God there is the midst of the garden praise God that is an spiritual Garden because in that Garden there are only two kinds of tree the tree of life and the tree of knowledge next praise God see and the fruit of the Tree of Life Is Life and the fruit of tree of knowledge is death that's why I said the all of these are spiritual right because praise God you cannot buy the tree of knowledge in Lula Georgia no that's right right you cannot find that in Walmart no no right praise God or in any mall can you buy a tree of knowledge none see so it means this is spiritual this is natural see like avocado mango banana these are natural fruit they are growing in natural tree they are planted in natural garden and you eat it naturally see praise God hallelujah so this now what is the so what is see now in the scripture next praise God it says here in John chap 10: 10 the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy I am come that they might have life and that might have it more abundantly see here you can see the two three one tree produce death one tree produce life see they are side by side see one give you that one give you life life abundantly then next it says here in John 151 I am the true B and my father is the husband man praise God next praise God see Hallelujah see Jesus said I am the tree and you are the branches see so these two tree are you know they are a person see praise God as long as they listen they eating the fruit praise God see they are fine they will live right praise God hallelujah see Hallelujah see now what is the fruits what is the fruits that the woman eat eat you know next we have a parallel scripture in Proverbs 3: 30: 20 it says such is the way of an adulterous woman see it and wipeth her mouth and say I have done no wickedness see so this woman she did something she eat the fruits see that's why Jesus said by their fruits you will know them amen by their fruits you will know them amen by their works you shall you will know them by their acts you will know them see so the fruit and the ACT they are same praise God see so this woman he make a certain act he ate it and she said I do know wickedness see she do she is an adulterous he committed an adult adultery Act Right sure praise God see Hallelujah see so what happened you know what did the woman do remember like I told you we have the circum circumstantial evidence right praise God see Satan offer her to be like God y right right see look in Genesis chapter 1 in Genesis chapter 2 you cannot see that God heals there is no sickness right there is no salvation why there is no fall yet how can he save when there is no fall how can he heal sick when there is no sickness see what is the only thing that the woman can see the woman see that God is a Creator right right that's right praise God see so the when the serpent offer him that he's trying to tell him you will be like God you will be like a Creator see praise God and remember we have four Kingdom on this Earth the kingdom of the plant the animal the fish and and the bird and each kingdom and it and each kingdom God gave them the power to procreate right right praise God see and each kingdom they procreate differently see like the chicken like the bird they lay egg see praise God have you seen cow lay egg no no they don't lay egg the three bear flowers see praise God you never seen a chicken you know bear flowers no they procreate differently see remember the serpent is an animal corre praise God what the animal do he introduce it to the human see that same Act Right praise God see there's no Young no no no children okay right see that same act sex is of the animal okay right praise God the animal introduced it to the woman it was not supposed to be we are not supposed to come here by sex right praise God we are like God how God create by spoken word so we can create by a spoken word without sex amen see it is of the animal amen the animal introduced it to the human being that's why in the eyes of God it was so dirty right it was so dirty right praise God that's why in the time of in the time of Israel when you do that praise God yeah without the proper way all the children up to 10 generation cannot enter into the congregation see the the blood of the animal cannot cover that kind of sin even if you kill a million people just one maybe one one cup of blood yeah of the Lamb MH is sufficient to cover that sin amen that's right but that kind of sin yeah the blood of the animal cannot cover it it's so strong right that's why God needs a very strong Covenant see that before you do it you need to be under that Covenant right we call it the marriage covenant see praise God don't do it outside the Covenant if you do it outside that marriage covenant we call it fornication right right see if you do it after the Covenant we call it adultery see don't do it amen praise God it's so sacred that's why the Bible said marriage is Honorable and the bed will be undefiled see if you do it outside that Covenant everything that you will do it's so dirty in the eyes of God right amen because that is not the will of God see it's a permissive will of God that's why I've been telling it to the young people don't do it amen pray God see or you get married it's so easy praise God see there is no divorce praise God don't be don't use it as an option right praise God that's why the prophet said that's a problem in even in the time of Jesus that's right y That's confronted Jesus Jesus said then the the people asking why did Moses allow it it was not so in the beginning that isn't a perfect will of God because of your heart hardness of the heart that's right amen Moses God allow Moses it is not of God God allow Moses amen see praise God and it was written in the Bible and these theologians keep on reading it it say in the Bible it's in the Bible if God allow it see that's why the prophet said it's a misinterpreted theology see then thirdly in our age it become a modern condition because everybody is doing it see that's why the prophet said tell your children teach your children don't do it that's right see right but sometimes these things happen see to me you know praise God it's plaguing The Message Church also praise God everywhere I go I've been telling it to to the people you know sometimes it's hard to tell it to them sometimes I don't know if I tell it if I still have a open door praise God but this is the message that is the first problem in the garden of Eden right right who may who do it first right Adam I mean Eve what did Adam do did he cast her out no in all sins the only solution is forgiveness right see that's the only solution forgiveness see we have no hope right did Jesus cast us out no he forgive us amen amen praise God so this things did not come from the Lord not not uh this is not the way of human you know is the serpent the animal introduces to us and we are doing it and we need praise God that marriage covenant praise God hallelujah we don't believe in premarital sex amen praise God don't do it don't do it praise God hallelujah see so next now so here's the serpent and there's Adam there's the woman there are the three major character praise God the serpent did something next to the woman he introduced the way of reproduction of the animal sex see that's why sex is of the animal next praise God see then the woman pass it to Adam and that produced The Fruits right next praise God see next see there's can next and there's Abel see so God said your seed the serpent seed will always be in enmity they were the serpent seed will always be against the seed of God see so Cain kill Abel see just in the beginning just in the start next praise God see H Allelujah then Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived and bear C and said I have gotten a man from the Lord and she again bear his brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of a sheep but Cain was a taor of the ground see so they have both different DNA yeah one is a uh praise God Keeper of the ship one is a tailor of the ground see remember like father like son it's always like that like father like son they inherited the son always inherited what's their father is doing amen next praise God see so the Bible never called them twin next praise God see you know if you read some um um Bible helps um the Thomson contemporaries they will tell you see uh some say they were born at the same time some say they will born uh with a days apart or months apart years apart then it's up to you to choose yeah see but the prophet said they were born at the same time okay so I always stick to what the prophet said amen that's right see remember if s said so watch what the prophet said stick to what the prophet said that's right see you know the you know when I when I'm when I'm trying to prepare a sermon about the ark praise God see I said what is this goer wood I go into the internet and search you know and nobody can tell it what is the go what w that Adam use I was surprised see they don't know what that's go for w but the prophet described it right he said it is a softwood see it is a sinker not a floater but God did something praise God heuck the juice of the other golfer wood praise God and boil it praise God and apply it to that so food and that soof wood become as strong as the steel and it will not absorb the water and it float I said my goodness am yeah they don't know what it is but you know it amen I know it that's right praise God the prophet said it yeah that's right see you know the the the the the the the Furniture in the Tabernacle of God do you know what kind of food that they use see they are in the wilderness there are so many ants many thermites y see many insect but the prophet said they use a certain kinds of food that it is insect repellent they don't know what what it is right but the prophet knew what it is right sure and We Know It Hallelujah see praise God so they are born at the same time but they are not tens because they have separate fathers next praise God hallelujah see and Adam called his wife then he Chang his wife from it to to from woman to Eve praise God because he was the mother of all living next praise God hallelujah see next next so they kill Abel can kill Abel praise God and here come set amen praise God now this is the genealogy we know it praise God from Jacob next i i w going to read it anymore I know you knew it right that's in in Luke chapter 3 next praise God see H Allelujah see next praise God okay next I just want to show you that Cain is not in the linage of Adam that's right see so Cain is not the son of Adam see because Adam praise God look see when when Cain came Abel God replace it with Seth see so Seth become the firstborn of Adam next and Adam is a Son of God Amen see so Adam now is in the linage of the Son of God see so when the when the times goes on next praise God see so this is the proof okay praise God if you read Jude chapter 1 ver14 from Seven see is Enoch right up from Adam Enoch is seven from Adam see so if we will count it so Cain is not again in the linage of Adam that's prove that's prove it okay next praise God see so where did Cain come from not as Cain who was of the wicked one so he came from the wicked one so Cain is the son of the devil so he's the firstborn of the devil see praise God hallelujah see next Hallelujah yeah next now praise God see now we will go in to the ark amen the mystery in the ark next praise God just 15 minutes we'll be all right praise God see then men began to multiply into face of the Earth and daughters were born unto them praise God hallelujah next what the sons of God when the that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives all which they choose now they we have two linage coming up next praise God see Hallelujah and the Lord God said my spirit shall not always strive with men for that he also is flesh yet his day shall be 120 years and there were giants on the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of God when the sons of God came into the daughters of men and they bear children to them the same became Mighty Men which were of the of old men of fre know next praise God see now but Noah found Grace in the eyes of God remember this word Noah no found Grace see Noah found Grace next praise God hallelujah so we have this lineage next praise God see from Adam to Noah the Bible call it next praise God they were the sons of man and we have this the daughter of men see and We Know It praise God some you know some Bible theologians they said the Angels they are the sons they are the sons of God but no we saw it that Adam was a Son of God see so we have two linage coming up in the Book of Genesis next praise God see but in the times of Noah something happened when both when both uh linage grow in number now we have uh the sons of sons of God and the daughters of men see the sons of God saw that the daughters of men they were beautiful that is where the problem come in next praise God see so a mixed blood y praise God the blood of the Son of God and the and and the daughters of man they mingle and God was angry see because we know that the lion of Cain they were with the serpent blood and the serpent is an animal y praise God when that when that animal Blood come into the vein of the Son of God God was so angry praise God he sent the flood next praise God see he sent the flood Hallelujah see next praise God see and the book Genesis 7:7 Noah went in and his son and his wife and his son's wife with him into the ark because of the water of the flood next praise God in the self same day enter Noah Shem him and japed the sons of Noah and Noah's wife and the three wives of his son with them into the ark so you can see only Noah and his wife and his three son's wife went into the Ark and the sons of Noah that went forth to the ark were shame hem and japed and hem is the father of Canaan see so it emphasized the Bible keep on emphasizing that ham is the father of Canaan these are the three sons of Noah and them was the whole earth overspread so all of us came from the sons of Noah whether you like it or not and Noah came from the linage of Adam praise God hallelujah next praise God hallelujah and we know that Noah is a righteous M amen praise God see and then now a Souls were saved by the water see Noah Shem japet and ham they were and their and their wife so eight Souls were saved see so the next question how the serpent blood cross over okay praise God next Hallelujah so now no began to be a husband man and he planted a Vineyard and he drank of the wine and was drunken and he was uncovered with his tent and ham the father of Canaan saw the nakedness of his father so this is our key word again the nakedness of his father ham so the nakedness of his father see praise God but praise God Allelujah is keep on emphasizing he is the father of Canaan see next praise God Hallelujah and Shem and japet see soam told it to his two brother Shem and japet but then sh and japet took a garment and laid it upon both their should and went backward and covered they covered the nakedness of their father and their face were backward and they saw not their father's nakedness see praise God what happened in the in in that in that time you know and Noah awoke from his wine and knew what is younger he is the youngest okay he's the youngest son of had done unto him so he in between ham is in between okay next praise God hallelujah see when Noah awoke and he knew what his younger son did to him he says here and he said course be Canan the servant of servant shall be unto his his Brethren see who did the wrong thing who saw the naked of his father H right that's right but who did Noah curse see curs be Canan see servant of servants shall be unto his Brethren right see next and blessed be the Lord God of Shem Canaan shall be his servant see Noah okay I I I'm telling you there is a circum stantial evidence see praise God hallelujah see so he said curs be Canaan you now will become the servant of your brothers right see then Canan become the servant of jpet yeah he become the servant of shim next praise God hallelujah see so now it says H the father of Canan see and no what Cur can and he said you will be you will be a servant to your brothers next praise God in Genesis 22 h and f the father of Canan saw the naked father and his and told his to Brethren without so it is H who committed that act right praise God but Noah curs Canan right right see what did H do next see so this is the key word he saw the nakedness of his father next praise God Shem and japet covered the nakedness of this father next praise God now in Leviticus 20: 11 okay see and the man that lith with his father's wife had uncover his father's nakedness both of them shall surely be put to death their blood shall be upon them right yeah see so you can see this parallel scripture uncover his father's nakedness what did H do he saw the nakedness of his father see so Leviticus and the Book of Genesis there is only one writer that is Moses see praise God hallelujah so he's using the same language okay praise God hallelujah see so you know some people ask me so why did not the the scripture said then shall surely be put both of them shall surely be put to death their blood shall be upon them I said during the time of Noah there is no law see if there is no law you cannot accuse anybody see right praise God Amen remember that if there is no law we have no sin it is the law that tell us that we are a sinner right praise God God right Hallelujah see next so Genesis 10 verse 6 so Noah said Canan will be the servant to his brother see so now the sons of ham Co MRA put in Canan so four of them okay next praise God see so this is the three Brethren of Canan right right ham did it he uncovered his father nakedness the Bible said a man that lith wife of his father uncover his father nakedness so what did ham do he lith with his father's wife see who is the wife of his father his mother right y see next praise God see so supposed to be Canan will be the servant to his brother right praise God because that is the curse see next praise God see but he become the servant of Shem he become the servant of japet why see next praise God see the man lith with his mothers with his father's wife uncover his father nakedness so that is our key word so what did H do next see and you see these circumstances Canan become the servant to his two brother why see The Logical the only logical answer is next praise God they are Brethren see next why see they came from the same woman see they came from the same woman see what did H do he uncovered his father nakedness and the scripture is very clear it says he that lith with his father's wife uncover his father's nakedness so what he what he did something happened with M Noah and ham see praise God what happened praise God see Hallelujah Noah found Grace remember this Noah found Grace in the eyes of God next see here's see can these things happen that the son will Li it with his mother okay so you know C is one of the ham children cus do you know samiramis see they are husband and wife and they have a son who is their son next Nimrod right right who is the wife of nimrod next his mother MH see you can you know Al Alexander hipop to Babylon you can see it praise God where did nimrod get that idea from their father like father like son see that's why Jesus said to this to this uh to the Parise s you do what your father do they are following you know this this boy will not do unless they saw it from their father see they will not do anything unless they saw it from their father they saw their father do it who do it him see praise God hallelujah see so there's where's the mother and son worshiping okay praise God I know you have studied this before next praise God see now so this is the direct quote of the Prophet see it says here now Noah and his son which come come out hamem and japet come out in the righteous line they were in the righteous line how did the seed ever get over the seed come over in the Ark in the ark it's in the ark see like just like it did in the beginning through the woman again it's through the woman see so when Noah did that for 10 generation God did not deal with men Noah did something that he found Grace in the eyes of God see praise God when he did that so what will the children do they will follow what the father did see from through the W through the woman then their wives they carry the seed of Satan through the Earth just as he pack the seed of Satan to give birth to Cain through the woman see praise God that is the code of the Prophet amen praise God like I told you there is we have the circumstantial evidence praise God God how why did Canaan become a servant to sh and japet the only logical answer he is they are Brethren see he was not he did not become the servant of course he or misra or put okay so when that happened it only show praise God all of us that the blood of the serpent next when God created us is remember so even science proof it we know this see they call it heteropaternal super condemnation to which the born with different father see that's why I've been telling it to the people even science is proving it it can be done it can be done what happened in the Book of Genesis can be done next praise God see so another you know because we need one or two witnesses see when you are trying to give evidence we give one or two witnesses amen next praise God see so when God created us we are all clear see but then next something happen the blood of the animal come into our body see that's why the Bible is very clear for all have seen and have come short of the glory of God in the eye of God whoever you are whatever the color of our skin brown white black yellow any color blue orange see our blood is contaminated M sure see praise God in the eyes of God you know we are we are good to burning yeah see right we are no good in the eyes of God right praise God see that's why next see for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord next praise God see for by grace are you saved so we cannot save by works it's only by Grace see praise God because the the the problem is in the blood right see not in your act it's in the blood praise God it went into our body see that's why next praise God hallelujah see next I said in my heart concerning the estate of Sons of man that God might manifest them that that they might see that they are themself are beast we become like animal see sure praise God that's why a person a a man or a woman without God in their life they act like animal see praise God and do you know what is the law of the animal the law of the Jungle see the law of the Jungle the fittest survive see that is what's happening today you know praise God hallelujah hallelujah so that's what happened in the Garden of Eden like I say praise God hallelujah it needs to be you know to the to the message people it's very clear right praise God what happened in the Garden of Eden what happened to us that's why we understand why God need to die on the cross to spill that blood to redeem us because something happened in our blood praise God see we act like animal praise God you were born like that that's why God is not going to blame us if we are sinner God is not blaming us because we were born like that God will blame us because you do not accept the way of God see his provided way for us to be saved like I say it is free amen you don't need to do anything you just need to humble yourself see praise God because today A lot of people do not know why they need salvation yeah they thought they need salvation praise God just to join the church that's why when you when you talk to them about salvation they are thinking that you want them to join their Church they don't know the reason why why I need to be saved see why I need Jesus that's why some people just are looking for religion that will benefit them that will uh link or synchronize or will align with their thought see they don't know really what happened in the Garden of Eden once they know it then they will understand why we are like that why some people praise God when they hear the word of God they freely readily accept it why some people praise God you keep on pounding they even just screw their head still they don't listen why see but then we saw it amen amen praise God now we know now we understand what God did to us amen it's only his grace nobody can save himself Pastor cannot save you the church cannot save you nobody can save you except Jesus amen praise God can we all stand up let's sing that song Amazing Grace praise God hallelujah before I call on the pastor praise the Lord I
