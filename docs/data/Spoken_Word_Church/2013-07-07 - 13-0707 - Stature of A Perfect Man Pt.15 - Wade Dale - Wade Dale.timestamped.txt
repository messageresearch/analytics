[0:07] y'all had a wonderful teacher last
[0:09] sunday
[0:10] yes y'all were rough on him though
[0:14] man started on the first peter yeah
[0:15] he'll be there next time
[0:17] um next pete with first peter man he
[0:19] goes to read and y'all going no
[0:20] no stop you hear it on the thing no
[0:22] that's not it no where you at where are
[0:24] you somebody said where are you
[0:35] but it is people with like precious
[0:37] faith and we we uh
[0:39] we see that too but like brother brown
[0:41] says here we're going to start this
[0:42] sausage you must be warned again i want
[0:43] to make sure that we understand that
[0:44] that has changed
[0:46] there's got to be a change you say
[0:48] brother brown i know this certain woman
[0:50] over here why she never did do
[0:51] anything wrong she's a good woman or
[0:53] this sucking such a man he's a good man
[0:55] he never does anything you know he
[0:57] doesn't harm
[0:57] anybody that doesn't mean one thing he
[1:00] might make a good neighbor
[1:01] but he isn't a christian until he's born
[1:03] again
[1:06] jesus said abandon except a man be born
[1:08] again say john 3
[1:10] that he can't even see the kingdom now
[1:12] that means c means to understand
[1:14] you look at anything say i just don't
[1:16] see it you mean you don't understand it
[1:18] all right all right then he goes on
[1:22] mankind
[1:23] that natural eye can't see how the glory
[1:25] of god will come over a man's eyes and
[1:26] he'd see visions
[1:28] and tell men of certain things and what
[1:29] to do tell them things is fixing to
[1:31] happen
[1:32] and fix things that come past like the
[1:34] lord did for us here
[1:35] last night how about a miracle all right
[1:39] man speaking in tongues they can't
[1:40] understand that though until the man is
[1:42] born again
[1:44] then when he's born again then he's in
[1:46] line of fellowship
[1:49] that's when you become in line of
[1:50] fellowship that's when you become in the
[1:51] line of the new burden like dad was
[1:53] talking about last
[1:54] sunday that's where your life precious
[1:56] faith comes in you can't have
[1:58] like precious faith with a sinner and a
[2:00] saint you can converse and
[2:02] be friends and all that but when it
[2:04] comes down to the word of god
[2:06] two can't walk together unless they be
[2:08] agreed all right
[2:11] then when he's born again then he's in
[2:12] line of fellowship because he's a new
[2:14] creation that old suspicious doubting
[2:16] character he was
[2:17] is dead dead remember but they're
[2:19] preaching on the dead
[2:21] god let it die now he's a new creation
[2:24] so you see
[2:26] he don't have to add anything to his now
[2:27] because it automatically
[2:30] be added notice you must be born again
[2:32] and when you're born again you can't be
[2:33] born again without having faith that's
[2:35] right see on my chart here
[2:36] i got the very foundation faith is the
[2:38] foundation of all of it
[2:40] without faith it's impossible to please
[2:42] god
[2:43] neither cometh a god must believe that
[2:45] he is and a reward of those that
[2:46] diligently
[2:48] seek him see he must be and when you're
[2:50] a skeptic of the bible when you're
[2:51] skeptic of the word being right
[2:53] you just might as well stay back until
[2:54] first you believe it what is sin
[2:56] unbelievable two elements that control
[2:58] the human being
[2:59] now it's not see taste phil's melon here
[3:01] memory reason conscious effects and
[3:02] imagination
[3:04] that works because of what's on the
[3:06] inside
[3:07] all right you're possessed either that's
[3:10] either faith
[3:11] that's either doubt or faith one or the
[3:13] other you're possessed of one that
[3:15] dominates your life
[3:16] now you see that that dominates your
[3:18] life now
[3:20] because we have trials and struggles
[3:22] with the faith virtue and knowledge
[3:23] implications of godly brother kindness
[3:24] we have troubles with that
[3:26] that's the spirit part of man and
[3:30] really it doesn't have anything to do
[3:31] with the flesh because the flesh only
[3:32] does what the spirit tells it to do
[3:34] all right so you're possessed of one
[3:36] that dominates your life in other words
[3:37] it
[3:38] uh when i was a sinner and you were a
[3:40] sinner that dominated your life
[3:41] god had no part in it he was just not he
[3:44] was
[3:45] uh not there nor he wasn't
[3:48] it was you and the devil because you
[3:49] were married to him right
[3:53] but when you come into being born again
[3:54] you're possessed the one that dominates
[3:56] your life just depends on how much faith
[3:58] you have how high you can rise
[4:02] okay but first it's got to be faith let
[4:06] me stay on that foundation for a while
[4:08] now faith is what you must believe faith
[4:11] is what substance things hope for
[4:13] it you already have it when you have
[4:15] faith because it's revealed in faith
[4:17] faith is the subject of things hope for
[4:19] hebrews 11 the evidence what is it
[4:21] what kind of evidence may i
[4:24] may i not say something that brother
[4:26] brown did not say but a spiritual
[4:28] evidence
[4:29] brother brown said a holy evidence which
[4:31] is a spiritual evidence you've got to
[4:32] have a spiritual evidence
[4:35] there is a natural evidence
[4:39] and then there's a spiritual evidence
[4:41] all right the natural
[4:42] evidence is is what is outward there's a
[4:44] spiritual evidence which comes from
[4:46] inside
[4:47] works its way out and there's a
[4:49] spiritual evidence that you may do
[4:51] something wrong
[4:52] you may hurt a brother you may say
[4:55] something
[4:56] against somebody human nature you may
[4:58] you may do something
[5:00] but what that spiritual evidence will
[5:01] always say hey i'm sorry or repent or
[5:05] or you know things like that because
[5:06] remember
[5:08] anything that's not of faith is doubt
[5:10] and anything it's not a faith to sin
[5:14] okay so we're sinners saved by grace
[5:16] we've got to look at that blood
[5:18] atonement
[5:19] more now than ever before because if we
[5:21] don't look at that blood atonement
[5:23] you just got to look at your natural
[5:24] self and your natural self just not
[5:26] going to make it
[5:28] depend on him to kill it god let it die
[5:31] you can't kill anything but you know
[5:34] what you can do i was telling them at
[5:35] brother doug scott last sunday
[5:38] you can let you can let the lord in
[5:41] but there's still other doors in your
[5:43] house
[5:44] he may be in your living room
[5:48] but if there's a door of pride or this
[5:50] or
[5:51] that or whatever it is if there's a door
[5:53] there that you don't want him in
[5:55] the holy ghost is a timid person he will
[5:58] not force himself into that
[6:00] into that room so the holy ghost is a
[6:02] gentleman he can ask you
[6:04] you can actually grieve the holy ghost
[6:08] that's right grieve not the holy spirit
[6:09] of god thinks in ephesians
[6:11] whereby you are sealed until the day of
[6:13] your redemption you're sealed
[6:14] but it doesn't mean the holy ghost
[6:16] leaves you and go down on a limb that's
[6:17] just illustration purposes what it means
[6:20] is
[6:20] god said hey you got a problem
[6:24] you need to fix it and i'm going to just
[6:27] step out here real quiet
[6:29] and i'm going to wait on you because
[6:32] he's a gentleman
[6:32] he's not going to force himself he's a
[6:34] gentleman he's going to say hey i'm
[6:35] going to wait on you because remember
[6:37] brother brown says
[6:38] it's not that the devil comes in right
[6:42] the devil doesn't come in you go out to
[6:44] meet the devil
[6:45] you're the one that goes out you go out
[6:48] to meet the devil the devil can't get in
[6:49] your soul
[6:50] if you're born again you just can't
[6:52] reside there two people can't reside in
[6:54] the same place all right
[6:55] but now he can sure get in that memories
[6:57] and conservation imagination
[6:59] and get so close to that soul
[7:02] right because you can't you can't you
[7:05] separate my soul
[7:06] my spirit i'm a dead man but we can see
[7:09] what dominates that's what he said what
[7:11] dominates your life
[7:13] up in the quote before that it's what
[7:15] you need to look at
[7:16] and that's why that we need to look and
[7:18] keep looking at a holy evidence
[7:20] our spiritual evidence therefore when
[7:22] you say brother branham i believe that
[7:23] god is the healer
[7:24] well if you believe that then accept him
[7:25] as your healer and not lying
[7:27] but actually believe that he by his
[7:29] stripes you're healed there's nothing
[7:31] going to turn you from it
[7:32] it's a settled thing now you might have
[7:34] hope
[7:36] just keep dodging to this and dodging to
[7:38] that but when you've got faith you know
[7:40] it
[7:41] because it is the evidence you've
[7:43] already got it
[7:45] that's what we've got to believe he's
[7:48] talking about oral roberts
[7:50] um with a contact told me to touch my
[7:53] radio now he said oral roberts did good
[7:55] things
[7:56] too bad i got more of him but what he's
[7:58] trying to say is faith doesn't need
[7:59] anything
[8:01] so i said there was never a devil cast
[8:04] out in the in the
[8:05] in the bible by screaming and grabbing
[8:08] and
[8:08] pushing and pulling and throwing them on
[8:10] the ground and
[8:12] we see that happen a lot
[8:15] but power with character when the devil
[8:18] walks up to a christian that's really
[8:20] got the virtues
[8:23] jesus just said leave
[8:28] and paul had that sorcerer following him
[8:31] around all the time and she just kept
[8:32] nanning
[8:33] and and and and and then and then and
[8:35] there and somebody around him said
[8:36] why don't you just rebuke her in other
[8:39] words he said
[8:40] i haven't got that nod yet okay that's
[8:43] why something can bug you for years
[8:45] then all of a sudden god says that's
[8:48] enough
[8:48] all right and what paul did paul turned
[8:51] around and rebuked the spirit not the
[8:53] woman he rebuked the spirit
[8:55] spirit left i don't believe he grabbed
[8:57] her and threw her up against the wall
[8:58] and shook her i believe he just said go
[9:00] i've had enough this is it go leave
[9:04] well you know what that's power with
[9:05] character because the devil knew there
[9:07] was something
[9:08] speaking like brother branham was
[9:11] speaking to that
[9:12] maniac now he said that maniac could
[9:15] have tore me up
[9:17] broke every bone in my body he was
[9:20] almost three times the size of brother
[9:22] brown
[9:22] so he could have just picked him
[9:23] probably up with one hand and throw him
[9:25] out in the congregation or up against
[9:26] the wall
[9:27] but there was power with character was
[9:29] standing there and he didn't say
[9:30] anything he just said leave
[9:32] he said you'll fall at my feet
[9:36] and he said you know in other words he
[9:37] reached back to strike him and he said
[9:38] all of a sudden
[9:39] he hit the quarter all right well that
[9:41] was faith
[9:43] brother had faith in who he was and we
[9:46] got to start having faith in who we are
[9:49] all right not not in that look
[9:52] not have faith in what we're going to be
[9:54] that's right
[9:57] have faith in who we are if you have
[9:59] faith in who you are it will carry to
[10:01] what you
[10:01] carry you to what you want to be
[10:03] everybody understand that because you
[10:05] can't say well i'll have faith next week
[10:07] right or i'll have faith when i get
[10:08] patience i'll have faith no
[10:10] you gotta have faith you gotta believe
[10:13] that i am a christian and i am born
[10:15] again
[10:16] problems problems problems
[10:20] peter had a problem with his temper when
[10:23] he got born again
[10:25] i'd say he didn't have that kind of
[10:27] problem with his temper but
[10:28] he come to a place where he had to have
[10:30] temperance right
[10:32] right because peter's what it says add
[10:33] to your faith virtue knowledge temper
[10:35] because he knew he had a temper so we
[10:38] know the things that we need to work on
[10:40] there's no way that i know what you need
[10:41] to work on there's no way you know what
[10:43] i need to work on
[10:46] except that we can put it in the
[10:48] reflection or the mirror of the word of
[10:50] god
[10:51] because here the roman went out to meet
[10:53] jesus
[10:54] so i'm not worthy you even come into my
[10:56] roof i'm not worthy
[10:58] my son's very sick you just speak the
[11:00] word and my son will live what is it
[11:02] distance made no difference
[11:04] because god is on the present omnipotent
[11:06] and everywhere god is omnipotence is
[11:08] there
[11:09] and god being on the president that
[11:10] makes god everywhere all over see
[11:12] he's in africa and all those places but
[11:15] he says i'm not worthy that you come
[11:16] into my roof just speak the word
[11:18] what was it it was that roman's faith
[11:20] now look that roman didn't have
[11:22] substance faith
[11:24] he didn't have holy ghost faith because
[11:26] he didn't possess it
[11:28] he just had faith in what that person
[11:30] said that's why
[11:32] that a prostitute could come before
[11:34] brother branham she knew she was dirty
[11:36] she knew she but she's
[11:37] in other words in her heart she said i
[11:40] believe what that man says
[11:41] you know she got her healing why
[11:45] she didn't have things like we as
[11:47] christians would walk up in front of
[11:49] brother around him and go oh i spoke bad
[11:50] to my my wife this morning and i spoke
[11:53] bad to my boss today before and you know
[11:55] those things just the devil just start
[11:56] bombarding you with all that stuff
[11:58] and what brother brad said you'll miss
[12:00] your healing because of what
[12:02] because you're thinking about all the
[12:03] things that you did do and didn't do
[12:06] okay jesus just said
[12:10] go your way your son lives
[12:13] it was a two-day journey and in other
[12:16] words he was healed the same hour that's
[12:18] the kind of faith
[12:19] we got to have
[12:24] i'm nip that i'm president i'm this
[12:26] infinite that's god so when they make a
[12:27] phone call say pray
[12:29] that contacts he prayers the contact yes
[12:32] not the hand the bible does say lay
[12:34] hands on the scene and shall recover
[12:36] didn't say pray all right said lay hands
[12:40] on the sick and they shall recover
[12:44] your faith brings god it's the thing
[12:48] that brings the prayer and god together
[12:50] on the scene now now here's a point that
[12:54] i want to look at faith changes from
[12:56] here to here it brings it together
[12:58] but realize one thing god knows the
[13:00] outcome of the prayer
[13:01] yes so we're not praying
[13:06] to to make god realize that he's the
[13:09] healer you understand what i'm saying
[13:10] he's
[13:10] he wants us to realize and in our
[13:13] journey as we walk
[13:15] he wants us to see not the change that's
[13:18] in him but the changes in us
[13:21] okay because if you've got the holy
[13:23] ghost you've got everything you need
[13:25] why does it not work 100
[13:28] because of us that's right right
[13:31] because the holy ghost is faith virtue
[13:34] knowledge
[13:34] temperance patience godliness brother
[13:36] kindness and love
[13:38] because that love if you're born again
[13:41] today and you die today
[13:43] they put you we put you in a grave in a
[13:45] couple of days
[13:46] you will resurrect with that perfect
[13:49] love actually you'll go into that
[13:50] dimension
[13:51] that's right where perfect love is
[13:53] brother brown said all that you know the
[13:55] angel said he said well how do these
[13:56] people all get here
[13:57] he said they all had perfect love what
[14:00] they had the new birth
[14:01] for their portion or for their time
[14:04] or for their ability all right
[14:08] that we were talking about last night
[14:10] martin luther had the ability
[14:12] to bring a group of people to have faith
[14:15] in the just shall live
[14:19] by faith you understand what i'm saying
[14:22] because what happened was
[14:24] they were believing in a catholic church
[14:26] a catholic dogma
[14:27] they were believing in the pope they
[14:29] were believing in a priest
[14:31] but martin luther was trying to say hey
[14:33] you don't need to do that we don't need
[14:35] an
[14:36] intercessor between you and god
[14:39] right he said you don't need an
[14:41] intercessor that's what he was saying he
[14:42] said you don't need that
[14:44] because the just shall live by
[14:47] the catholic church that's what they
[14:49] were trying to say
[14:51] the just shall live by the catholic
[14:53] church or you can do penance and we'll
[14:54] give you this this and this
[14:56] you know we'll give you some of these
[14:57] verses if you've got enough money you're
[14:59] right
[14:59] what the catholic church would say you
[15:01] got enough money we'll just hand you
[15:02] these virtues
[15:03] the priest has them hey the dude's got
[15:06] the ability to turn that wafer into the
[15:08] into the body of god i mean come on now
[15:10] but we know he didn't we know that was
[15:12] false but people had faith in that and
[15:14] they got healed because of that
[15:15] that's right during the age of columbus
[15:19] that was real hard time to be
[15:21] to be alive of course that was a martyr
[15:23] time but to be a christian
[15:27] you were different all right well see
[15:29] martin luther
[15:30] come to a place to where he brought a
[15:33] group out and said the just shall
[15:35] live by the faith of god not the faith
[15:38] you have in a priest
[15:40] that's why they excommunicated it that's
[15:43] why then he wrote the 95 thesis that's
[15:45] why then
[15:46] he come out and said the just shall live
[15:49] by faith
[15:50] not by penance because you know what he
[15:51] did penalties you ever watch the movie
[15:53] he'd crawl on the ground he would
[15:55] he would lay prostate on the ground on
[15:58] rocks with his face in the rocks
[15:59] what trying to get those evil thoughts
[16:02] out of his mind he thought he could do
[16:03] enough penance
[16:04] to get his mind pure that's what i
[16:06] believe martin luther was trying to do
[16:07] if you watch him you saw him in that
[16:09] room in the movie a really good
[16:10] portrayal of
[16:11] of martin luther but he was man just
[16:13] like demons were
[16:15] were you know in and out of his brain
[16:17] trying to tell him to do things
[16:18] and he was trying to get rid of that and
[16:20] i believe though that god came and told
[16:22] him i believe
[16:22] an angel i believe all the church age
[16:24] messengers had angels right
[16:26] brother branham had one paul had one i
[16:28] believe they all had an angel or had a
[16:30] visitation from god let's say that
[16:32] so they had a bit of visitation from god
[16:40] from god and that that angel just like
[16:44] with brother branham he took him to
[16:45] scripture and i believe that the angel
[16:47] took martin luther because remember the
[16:50] just shall live by faith
[16:52] is not just in the new testament
[16:55] i think it's in the it's in zechariah or
[16:58] somewhere it says the just
[16:59] shall live by faith then hamacha
[17:03] they just shall live by faith well he'd
[17:05] have to go to the new testament they
[17:07] were just writing the new testament at
[17:08] that time during martin luther's time
[17:10] he looked back in the old testament and
[17:12] i believe the angel said here
[17:14] this is what's promised to you see
[17:17] my point i'm making is is you and i must
[17:19] see that the promise made us
[17:21] that's the promise made to us right that
[17:23] mountain caleb
[17:25] that's the mountain that you're desiring
[17:27] to possess but you're not just going to
[17:29] walk up there
[17:30] and have cake and ice cream with the
[17:31] enemy
[17:34] he'll kill you
[17:39] it's it's hard for me to understand how
[17:41] god can i know god honors faith
[17:44] but it's hard to understand how he
[17:46] honors
[17:47] the faith that people have in
[17:50] the catholic church another religion
[17:54] well faith is the substance of things
[17:56] hoped for the evidence of things not
[17:57] seen it didn't say you had to believe
[17:59] the message
[18:00] okay right
[18:03] he just said faith is the substance of
[18:05] things hoped for
[18:07] that prostitute walked up there and just
[18:09] believed so much
[18:11] she didn't believe that so much that god
[18:13] was in her she believed god was so much
[18:15] in that man
[18:17] standing in front of him that that faith
[18:19] had a contact just for a second
[18:21] now it didn't save her soul just faith
[18:24] for the time
[18:24] then save her soul but you're right she
[18:27] had faith for her time
[18:28] she had split second faith to get healed
[18:32] because healing atonement is not based
[18:34] on christianity
[18:37] by his stripes all christians are healed
[18:40] that's not what the bible says
[18:42] by his stripes you are healed or we're
[18:44] healed
[18:46] i'm just going to say to trudy
[18:49] when i think about that i think of it as
[18:51] like a law like a law of god like
[18:54] or like the law of gravity i mean it's
[18:57] just
[18:58] it's just a thing that you enter into
[19:00] that you enter into that and you have it
[19:02] but it's not
[19:03] it's not this faith that we were talking
[19:05] about here it's not a holy evidence
[19:08] because that wasn't a holy person that
[19:10] was walking up before brother brown
[19:12] but they uh god so honored her just
[19:15] saying i just believe to god
[19:17] i just believe the guy can touch god and
[19:19] if he said there's an angel between me
[19:21] and him
[19:22] guess what there's an angel between me
[19:24] and him
[19:25] and that angel has come to heal me
[19:33] it's configuring updates it's updating
[19:36] the computer
[19:40] whatever let it uh don't turn it off
[19:43] yeah i know
[19:44] it's got to configure the updates
[19:47] computer age man all right but what
[19:50] happened is that you enter into a law
[19:52] but now that's not that faith right
[19:54] there
[19:56] everybody understand that's not that
[19:59] faith that's substance
[20:00] that's faith that carries you every day
[20:03] of your life
[20:04] the faith that woman had in brother
[20:06] branham was i'm here in front of a man
[20:09] of god
[20:10] i believe what he said if he said
[20:12] there's an angel standing there do you
[20:13] know what i just believe it
[20:15] and god honored that healed her
[20:18] but now the next day she went and done
[20:20] her business if you understand what i'm
[20:21] talking about
[20:22] she didn't have substance faith she had
[20:24] faith for the time
[20:26] just like a lot of people do maybe that
[20:28] thing will pop back up
[20:30] they'll have faith for the time and then
[20:32] you see them they'll
[20:34] they'll get a case of justification or a
[20:37] case of sanctification and they'll feel
[20:38] good
[20:39] and then all of a sudden you don't see
[20:40] them tomorrow
[20:44] no that's okay i will finish next sunday
[20:47] just left the thing
[20:48] let it let it do its updates it's been
[20:50] walking too for
[20:52] a month let it update but uh
[20:55] i don't ever plug this one in so i don't
[20:57] except for here
[20:59] and uh it probably just needs to do a
[21:01] date on
[21:02] something on there but don't worry about
[21:04] it but that faith
[21:06] at the bottom of that pyramid that faith
[21:08] is the
[21:09] faith of god that's not having faith
[21:13] that is the faith of god first we have
[21:15] to have faith in that
[21:17] but that is the faith of god not
[21:19] something you're looking toward it's
[21:21] something that's right here
[21:22] right that's what i said if you have
[21:24] faith
[21:26] now yeah you can it will take you but if
[21:30] you don't have faith now if you didn't
[21:31] say well i'm going to have faith when i
[21:32] get
[21:33] i'm going to have faith when i i'm going
[21:35] to have
[21:36] you're pointing forward you've got to
[21:39] bring that faith
[21:40] here you know what the substance
[21:44] faith is the substance you know what
[21:46] that substance is you
[21:50] faith is the substance of things hoped
[21:52] for you
[21:54] the evidence you
[21:58] of things not saying because you know
[21:59] what jesus christ died
[22:01] one day you've got the new birth and
[22:03] look when you got the new birth what
[22:05] happened
[22:08] eternal god came into this body
[22:12] moved satan out and you know what that
[22:15] was the most
[22:16] the greatest act since creation right
[22:21] but did you see it right
[22:26] did you see it did you physically see
[22:30] faith is the substance of things how far
[22:32] the evidence of things not
[22:34] seen i mean we experienced it it said it
[22:38] was an
[22:39] it was something we experienced
[22:42] right right but it's without observation
[22:45] exactly you can't there's no way you
[22:49] could you
[22:49] you didn't i don't i don't think you did
[22:51] anybody see
[22:53] this burning fire come down and
[22:56] and where did it go in your mouth top of
[22:58] your head in your ears and i'm trying
[22:59] i'm making a silly point but i'm trying
[23:01] to make a point
[23:03] how do you know you're born again you
[23:04] had to have faith
[23:07] that god let it die that's right god did
[23:09] it
[23:10] and then what you're going to do is
[23:12] though is you're going to produce the
[23:13] evidence
[23:14] the evidence of things not seen you're
[23:17] the evidence
[23:18] that's true you're the evidence whether
[23:21] you believe the word
[23:22] whether you come i don't say even come
[23:23] to church
[23:25] but whether the word of god is in you
[23:26] because it's the word of god then you
[23:27] will come to church so that's what
[23:28] scripture says
[23:29] all right but listen
[23:33] that evidence has got to show
[23:37] that's right on the day of pentecost
[23:39] they were scared before
[23:41] that was the evidence it showed
[23:44] right but when the holy ghost came and
[23:48] licks of fire and burn out the old man
[23:51] right
[23:52] god killed 120 old husbands that day
[23:56] right plus they had so much faith that
[23:59] 120 had so much faith
[24:03] till all those virtues were burned into
[24:05] them at the same time
[24:08] why because they had heard the word
[24:10] that's why you can walk you could walk
[24:12] years without
[24:13] with not having any birth but be
[24:16] sanctified and be packing the word in
[24:18] and
[24:19] the same thing was talking about the
[24:20] other day about the seals you can hear
[24:22] the seals
[24:23] put that in your memory one day it will
[24:30] update
[24:37] windows install new updates guess what
[24:40] god is not updated
[24:42] but you're the one that needs to be
[24:43] updated so we need
[24:55] windows install new updates in this
[24:57] computer
[24:58] you know what god's doing the same thing
[25:00] with you
[25:02] you've got them you've earned hey we got
[25:03] memory we got all the things in this
[25:05] computer that we need
[25:06] i thought but some of those programs
[25:10] some of those programs need to be
[25:12] updated
[25:13] so god says hey i updated 120 in the
[25:16] upper room i downloaded
[25:18] would you say now download it he
[25:20] downloaded
[25:23] that that happened for a purpose you
[25:24] know
[25:26] god downloaded into 120 of those virtues
[25:30] right that's right that's what jesus
[25:33] said they were plugged into god you got
[25:34] to be plugged into god first
[25:37] all right then he brings the downloads
[25:39] then you know what they get updates we
[25:42] get updates
[25:44] every sunday and wednesday we get
[25:47] updated
[25:51] from the from the from the from the
[25:54] master hard drive
[26:00] because he's driving hard to get it in
[26:02] us
[26:04] so got his windows that happened for a
[26:06] reason
[26:08] that did happen for a reason but that's
[26:10] right i mean that's true you have the
[26:11] holy ghost
[26:12] these things had programs in it and they
[26:14] were all working
[26:16] but something decided that it needed an
[26:18] update
[26:19] something on the internet decided it
[26:21] needed an update now did you see it come
[26:22] in here and update the thing
[26:26] this is wireless this is just plugged in
[26:28] to give you a signal
[26:29] but what i'm getting from the internet
[26:31] is wireless it's running through this
[26:33] room
[26:33] but something in this computer you
[26:37] said i need an update because i don't
[26:39] have everything i need
[26:41] to make the program work right and i
[26:43] just goes to show you that this
[26:45] relates to every every aspect of the
[26:48] world
[26:49] well see this right here is the master
[26:51] hard drive right
[26:52] this is your master hard drive right
[26:54] here the bible that's your master heart
[26:55] that's where everything is
[26:57] and you know what you can limit it
[27:00] because you limit your hard drive right
[27:02] now you get it cluttered with junk
[27:04] right you can get you can you can
[27:05] clutter it with junk
[27:08] you have to be defragged every once in a
[27:09] while
[27:12] bob you have to help me on this one i'm
[27:14] done no but look
[27:18] if you can't see because we're all hey
[27:21] we're all defragged defrag
[27:22] defragmentation means
[27:24] that that something happens and you stop
[27:27] the program
[27:28] or something quit working and what
[27:30] happens in the hard drive there's a
[27:31] space
[27:33] but there's memory can go in that space
[27:35] what defragmentation does
[27:37] that's pretty good what defragmentation
[27:40] does
[27:41] it takes that gap and it pulls it back
[27:43] together and you can use that space
[27:45] again
[27:45] so what you do on a defragmentation
[27:47] screen you see little
[27:49] everybody ever played tetris you want to
[27:52] have to see it's just little blocks here
[27:53] and there and all over the place
[27:55] what happens is the computer brings all
[27:57] those
[27:58] spaces together and connects them so
[28:00] that you can use a big block
[28:03] of memory down here at the bottom
[28:07] is that good is that right right so so
[28:09] we need to be defracted
[28:11] once in a while we get derailed so we
[28:14] get derailed and we stop god we do it
[28:16] we stop god we stop the program of god
[28:20] all the time do we yeah we do we stop
[28:23] the program of god
[28:24] and you know what happens he says hey
[28:26] there's a gap in there
[28:29] going to defrag you i'm on
[28:32] defragmentation
[28:34] so you got a good you got a good uh
[28:36] lesson on defragging your computer you
[28:38] can actually
[28:38] put defrag you can defrag any computer
[28:41] and it makes it run better
[28:42] it does doesn't it but it makes you run
[28:44] better because what happens is that hard
[28:46] drive starts reading it it finds the gap
[28:48] and it kind of stops
[28:50] but you put the chain back together
[28:53] 66 of them you put the chain back
[28:56] together and you know what
[28:58] that meant that that memory that message
[29:00] can flow right through
[29:03] and you get a lot better contact with
[29:04] god so yeah
[29:06] pretty good that was not in the notes
[29:09] for the day so
[29:10] whatever happened to that that's what
[29:16] happened
