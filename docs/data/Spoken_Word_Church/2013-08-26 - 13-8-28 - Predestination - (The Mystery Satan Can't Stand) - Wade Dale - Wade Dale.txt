hurried pace there's often ways no sense of reason or wrong but when i think of my new life in my brand new home the first thing that comes to mind is my time at his throne but when it's my time i'm gonna take my time to behold his face when it's my time gonna take my time just to talk of his amazing grace i want to thank him for the lord that he bore and not leave in me alone imagine millions upon millions can't you see them there in line they're just waiting for a moment or more of a precious savior's time and when i finally stand in his presence i'll take a thousand years maybe two just to thank him for his wonderful love and his grace that brought me through but when it's my time you're gonna take my time to behold his face and when it's my time i'm gonna take my time just to talk of his amazing grace i want to thank him for the lord that he bore and not leave in me alone when it's my time gonna take my time at his throne i wanna thank him for the love that he bore and not me when it's my time all right i know sister june sings but i didn't ask her she's saying no i knew she was going to say no because we're good friends and good friends would never put good friends on the spot and say would you like to sing i'm really glad to have them they get to stay in my house when they come and they're more than just brothers and sisters they're good friends to this church and to us and we appreciate that i know you're going to enjoy brother wade brother rory do you have a fresh bottle of water for brotherly this one's got like nine lip tracks on it so i know he doesn't want that one and so i meant i told him this morning make sure you get a bottle of water back there so we're gonna do that number 566 as the deer panteth for the water you got a little thirst in you this morning let's sing it together as the deer panteth for the water so my soul longeth after thee and you are alone are my hearts desire and i long and you alone are my strength my shield to you alone

you can sigh this fight for you all alone are the real joy giver and you alone are my strength my shields were number 913 as we stand a few more minutes and brother wade will be out here preaching to us aren't you glad we are standing in the presence of the lord this morning i stand in all within the presence of the lord in whom the wisdom of the age is life for whom the raging of the sea subsides the living sacrifice the only source of light my hope is in the lord from this time on and evermore oh my hope is in the lord forevermore all his tender mercies his tender mercies come with every rising sun to meet the sinner in his brokenness to offer healing and forgiveness and those who trust in him will find their hearts all singing out to him and my hope is in the lord from this timeline and evermore oh my hope is in the lord forevermore one more time let him know that's where your hope sing it out oh my hope is in the lord from this time on evermore my hope is in the lord forever all right as our brothers come number 564 surely the presence of the lord is in this place you got that assurance and confidence this morning if he's here it's all that matters sing it out to him oh surely the presence of the lord is in this place i can feel his mighty power and his grace i can hear the brush of angels wing i see glory on each face surely the presence of the lord is in this place and surely the presence of the lord let's sing it to him this morning heal a brush angel's wings i see glory on each face surely presence of my lord this place can i get an amen from somebody i don't know about you but i wouldn't want to be here if i didn't think he was here this morning jesus said where two or three are gathered in my name must have been talking about the end time because in some gatherings you don't get more than two or three but that's encouragement enough to me to know that that uh if there's only two there you know there's an unseen guest there's the third one there but it's not people who just gather because you've got denominational churches all over town and you know that the lord has not gathered how he knows that revelation 3 tells us he's on the outside knocking to get in so he ain't there so it's two or three that god has gathered in his name under that headship those are the ones he's speaking to this morning and i trust he'll speak to us this morning i believe uh i believe uh the lord's got some good things for us as you can see behind me sister june's husband is in the house today and sister june is also here as well and he started this sister joe and said he's more known by sister jean's husband so so he does have a name and i believe it's brother wade so we're going to call him brother wade he's not a stranger to uh to wichita and we've always enjoyed his ministry and as i said i know the lord will have wonderful things for us today so let's enjoy the presence of the word the times of refreshing will do what come from the presence of the lord amen don't just come here to meet him we live in his presence but here's where he speaks to us so we'll just turn it over to our dear brother and give him the liberty to minister to us as the lord has put it on his heart brother wait god bless you my brother oh how about that oh lord have mercy could you not hear me anyway hey you didn't have to be so zealous of that you know you jeez what was i talking about how good y'all were and all that no forget it no good to be in the house of the lord good to be back among you good to be among the living really we're the only ones that do have life they just have a life that god permitted but this is a predestinated group of people and that's what we're going to talk about today is a little bit about predestination but we're going to kind of take it at an angle that maybe that i have not heard many people speak on and and take it in that in that order so i want to say that it's good to be here you all are my friends and you all are family not just friends we're family members we have a family gathering here i mean you got natural family out there but i'd rather be with a spiritual family even than the natural family so it's good to be in the house of the lord thank brother jim and sister regina for having us out uh wonderful man of god uh good friend and like i said a wonderful brother and brother tom and sister sandy for opening their home up and letting us stay there and and uh brother chad and sister christine they're just just wonderful people i don't want to call everybody's name because i'll miss somebody but but you all are special to me i think about you always and uh you come on my mind a lot uh every time i walk out to walked out the door chad's nasty shoes were standing out there that he left from from the fishing trip so that reminded me of him anyway nasty shoes and so we brought them back on a plane and they did confiscate them but they give it back to us and we were able to give them to him so so he has them now but it was horrible but anyway it's like a wet cow but let's turn our bibles if you will to the book of jeremiah and we will without any further ado like i said we love you with the love of the lord send you greetings from my dad out in lula georgia pastor samuel dale and we love him with the love of the lord also it's good to have a father in the gospel who's your natural father and i feel that god shined on something on me to let me have a real dad that's a real father you know and a father in the gospel that i can depend on and and be able to talk to him as a natural father and as a spiritual father so i just i thank god for that but thank each and every one of you for having us out we uh we sorry we didn't get out here in in uh in the main meetings but told brother jim we would be able to come maybe a little bit later on so we've been here a few days and flying out tomorrow about four so just keep us in your prayers and and like i said we we truly there's no words to express maybe when we get on the other side we'll be able to express more uh being in the finite world that we're in you can only say thank you and you say well does he really mean that or does he not mean that you know you can analyze all that but when we get over there there's not going to be any guesswork because if you made it and i made it we have the same mind and we have the mind of christ and we can understand each each and every one of us so the book of jeremiah we're going to speak today on it's really called the predestination the mystery satan can't stand but we're going to go a little bit uh different i was i ministered on this several years ago at the church and now dad's right in the middle of 10 or 12 services on predestination but we're going to look at predestination by foreknowledge you don't hear a lot of about foreign knowledge you hear about predestination which is good but we're going to see where the prophet said that's really not a good word to use okay so we'll go by what he says and then see how god can can bring it alive in our hearts so let's borrow heads before we get started dear heavenly father we come today with a glad heart that we're among believers and that you're not somewhere else as brother jim said you're you're not out there in the other churches we believe we brought you here today as our little lick of fire comes together lord may it become that cloud that pillar of fire lord where you cannot only be a bystander to watch our actions and reactions but lord you can be an active participant in this service you can be the hearer you can be the speaker you can be the one that sees or understands what's going on just let the holy spirit have total preeminence in this service lord bless the pastor here lord the deacons and elders and all the ones that attend here lord that you'll ever keep them strong give them good service lord for your will father forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes lord clear our mind that we may be able to speak you lord bless this day if you're getting sick among us lord you said you sent the word and healed them and delivered them from their destruction so we pray lord as the word goes forth that you would heal that you would minister that you would lord not only heal the physically sick but lord even the spiritually sick maybe someone backslid today lord it's trying to get back to you father may this help them lord and realizing that if we were a part of god then we were there before the foundation of the world not his people but lord is an attribute we ask just be with us now and take care of us lead us in guide us by your holy spirit in jesus name amen all right let's read jeremiah 1 verse 5. we're not going to do like they did back in the old testament where they stood for six hours so we'll have our seat in just a moment but you know what they found they found a word that had not been read right in the old testament and they were so zealous they stood for six hours while the priest just read this part that they had never heard before six hours and it's hard for us to stand a few minutes but listen to that dude no nobody fell asleep no no no they nobody fell asleep so jeremiah 1 verse 5. but i'm not going to make you stand for six hours okay before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb i sanctified thee and i ordained thee a prophet unto the nations now let's go to romans 9 verse 13. as it is written jacob have i loved and esau have i hated now let's read one more ephesians four they're going to have to bear with me back there i told the brother i said this is two sermons in one so i always think of double mint gum tom tom gets me all this carnal side you know two men you know you two remember the double mint two minutes two minutes well you're gonna get two sermons two sermons two sermons in one so just what you're going to get today ephesians 4 i'm in ephesians 1 verse 4 through 11. sorry ephesians 1. because see i scribbled all these i've had the erase and x out and all that so according as he has chosen us and we spoke on this several several years ago here um i believe the ephesian church was somebody he could paul could feel comfortable with with teaching them the word of god because they were a strong church they were a church that was mature he could talk to these people all right this was not milk this was meat all right according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us so we have a predestinated part that we got to come to according having predestinated us into the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will and we're going to talk a little bit about that because you can't get into predestination without getting into permissive will and perfect well okay all right so here we go to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath ex made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through the blood through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times times last 2000 years he might gather together one all things in christ which are in heaven which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will and brother brown said his will is his word all right so it's according to the counsel of his word so the the bible is the will of god all right so you can be seated in the lord add his blessing to the to the reading of the word as we get into this i i really when i title this it's a mystery satan can't stand because he can't of course he can't stand the word period but he can't stand something he can't get to and if you're predestinated in god today there's a part that god that satan can't get to he can't get to you and the devil can't understand that or he'd be your brother brother brown said if he could get if he could get a revelation right he would become your brothers but he so he's locked out of that that god has predestinated a group of people but now remember i want you to remember these two things number one predestinated is the promise he predestinated a group of people all right but now r predestination is the journey that we take because predestination is what destiny determined beforehand jacob have i love he saw have i hated all right so it's destiny determined beforehand now look if we're going to read some quotes but if god if we take that just by that then god's a respecter of persons if we take it just as that god's a respecter of persons and he's not there's no way he can bring me on this earth a different way than he brought adolf hitler on this earth or he's going to have to give adolf hitler the same thing he gives me everybody understand that say amen so god is not a respecter of persons we were all born in sin all shaping in iniquity william branham include dead come to this world speaking lies doomed and on our way to hell the prophet said so where there's none of us are are the good ones and then the bad ones because in god we were all born the same way right so we can't glory only that we were predestinated but look you've got predestinated but there's a journey to get to there everybody got that there's a journey to get to that spot so in other words god said i'm gonna have a bride now he knows who it is now look this is not for god's purpose today we're not preaching to god we're not god's all-knowing he he knew this before he ever created it so we're not telling him something but we are the ones through this conduit of of of man he's trying to get you to see that you were predestinated and there is a bride that's going to be on the earth at the time of a rapture but now you've got to determine whether you're part of that group or not he didn't or he's a respecter of persons did everybody understand that because it's like brother adam said we'll read it god you can't put it so close to where god put you in a tube and said this is the way rory is going to be that's a respect to a person that's predestination that's why brother brown said predestination is not a good word to say in a group of people because it is it's destiny determined beforehand written in a book right here but now sister lonnie's name's not in this book physically but if sister lonnie connects somewhere with the word she came by permissive well this is his perfect will we were not supposed to be born the way we're born that's permissive the perfect will of god was spoken children spoken word children which is happening now so we're going back to that right but listen to what brother brown said let's pull the the first quote up we're talking now a little bit about i want you to see something about perfect will and permissive will because that's what we live under you know brother branham said one time he said the holy ghost we've been talking about this in sunday school class the holy ghost is very timid the holy ghost is a gentleman the holy ghost will go out on a limb not that you'll not not that you've got the holy ghost and he's going to leave you and go sit somewhere no you you are a free moral agent even after you're born again you say oh we have no rights that's right we don't have any right we don't have any new thought coming we don't have any of that but as human beings we do i've been teaching on the statue of a perfect man brother brown preached doors indoors after god gets in your house after you let him in come on now that's what brother brown was talking about he wasn't just talking about like you said let me in let me in i'm at the front of your door no after we let him in there's a kitchen door there's a living room door there's a bedroom door and we keep that closed and when brother brandon made that statement he said the holy ghost is a gentleman well that's exactly what it is because god's not going to walk in your house and go let me in that room right there let me in that room no by your free will you allow him to go into that virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness that is all determined by you but now god's got a predestinated group that that's going to happen too what i call a spot there's a spot that we've got to get to because we fell from that spot and we got to get back to that spot okay right we fell from something and we're not going back to something different we're going back to where we fell from all right so in predestination but watch what when we come down here and keep that in mind destiny determined beforehand but you can't just stay on predestination we've got to bring in the word for knowledge okay because the word for knowledge is first we'll read it those he ford knew he did predestinate predestination wasn't first or he did predetermine and pull you through a tube and say this is the only way you can go but we still have those doors we still we bind the holy spirit brother brown said the holy spirit's been bound for two thousand years at the door of what creeds and dogmas that's not out there that's mine and yours he's not worried about their creed he knows it's wrong he's worried about the creeds and dogmas that you and i bring up oh i don't have any here you come preach because i have plenty of creeds that i bring up of my own and dogmas and that's what god's trying to do he's trying to kill that old husband that old nature give us virtue knowledge because it's a statue of a perfect man all right but let's not get on to that i don't want to lean on to that let's stay back into predestination let's look at quote number one does god change his mind about his word brother brown said but where he but told him he's talking to moses now watch moses he's talking to moses he said moses in other words but you're not going over you took my permissive will down here at the rock you glorified yourself and not me but now watch you sanctified yourself you didn't sanctify me isn't this me and you you didn't keep my original word what i told you to do yet the water did come yet the water did come he honored that prophet in permissive will and saved a group of people remember brother branham when he was going to or was it africa i believe it was and the lord told him not to go that way but remember the will of the ministers he said i'll go with you but we're going to have problems remember he drew a line and said we're going to have problems from here on well you know it wasn't that brother branham went and preached to the people though and nobody got saved and nobody got healed no he had a he had a successful campaign he paid for it because he made that choice remember he paid for that okay kind of a bad place to be a minister everybody wants to be a preacher and a and uh a pastor you better run from it because it's a it's a it's a responsibility you can lay hands on the sick and they recover you can prophesy or speak with tongues but the thing is keep his original word god don't change his mind friend you've got to keep his commission his will and that's where i fall i don't do what the word says if we come to a place where we all going to do what the word says all the time no we're still this is still permissive will this is going to be sticky i think i have a quote this is going to be sticky until the change so let's don't look at see then you look at predestination to where well i'm perfect i don't do anything wrong i'm god's predestinated me i'm signed sealed delivered locked in packed up and ready to go up by his fore knowledge he may have saw that but you haven't seen that yet right we're all getting older we can't think like we used to we can't work like we used to and that's perfect will of god no we never came the perfect way nobody except jesus nobody came the perfect way so we're all in the same level the same boat adolf hitler included eichmann all those people that you want to be you know you say well they're horrible you know what i believe hitler's mama said oh sweet little baby this is beautiful he's a wonderful child i'm going to train him up maybe he'll be a preacher one day but you know what one day he was just like judas brother brown said if judas would have went to pentecost right if judas would have went to pentecost but he didn't what he made a choice became the son of perdition same way with hitler hitler and all those they had a choice somewhere they're going to have to stand before god and they're going to say god i i become this because of some spirit that got on me and god's going to say i'm going to tell you the day it went on you and i'm going to tell you the day that i tried to get it off of you and i'm going to tell you the day that i sent a preacher by one day there's the judge he's going to judge them and say hitler i will come to you on this day and you refused me if he doesn't do that then he is a respecter or person he is he's not though he's not that way he's going to come to you say well there's 7 billion people in the world well so what god made him everyone so he can judge them all i mean sometimes we we limit god to a way to where he's like us he's not he's infinite we're going to get into something in a minute i want to see if you believe it or not you know how i like to like get you to think but god's so infinite we're going to prove this by foreign knowledge in a few minutes god is so infinite now see that infinite means all knowing brother sam he would know if you married someone else how your life would be if not he's finite like we were talking about yesterday we go with this certain girl and we think she's the love of her life she's beautiful i'm gonna marry that girl and then something happens if we believe that the hand of god is on us it's for a purpose but you can press your way in but if you'll pray pray before god young kids pray before god before you marry somebody because you might you might marry the wrong one god's not going to give you the wrong one but you may marry the wrong one come on now that's infinite god and he would know like my dad always says he he went out with this girl and and he went with this girl and she was a real nice sweet girl and and you know and he he thought maybe she would be the one well she wasn't my mom come on the scene well see i wouldn't have got here i would have got here a different way but if he would have married her her husband is a methodist preacher well see dad would have been in that line going in that direction toward the methodist being a methodist preacher so you see that god is infinite so i want you to see that that it's not that god would know what you were if you had never said yes to the message or that's the only way i can see how that god can say adolf hitler you're going to live in a certain time you're going to do all these hideous things and you're going to commit suicide he knew that right but he knew in his infinite mind he knew that if he gave adolf hitler a million years adolf hitler would never come to repentance now that i've got to believe but now you you have a choice to make just like he did but he knew his infinite mind knows that if he give all these people out in this world live a thousand years each live ten thousand years each they would never come to a place of repentance well see that way i can see how that god can be the judge he can judge them that way because he said you never accepted me here you turn me down all right so let's read the rest of this let's read the rest of this quote let's go to seed it's not air with the show now we see from what i said last night any move from that original plan of god throws the whole thing out of cater we can't move from that original word we talked on it last evening or evening last about balaam we'll see balaam's a perfect example hey this guy was a false prophet he got an audience with god several times remember and he wanted he wanted to curse israel and god wouldn't let him but in his mind in his human mind he wanted to curse israel but he couldn't he said i'm going to do what god said but remember you see what he did in his permissive will he kept pressing satan comes on the scene and says okay let's just get him to intermingle said we'll not destroy him here we'll just destroy him by letting him married and intermarry so see he got his way but it wasn't the right way but brother brown says look he got god's answer straight and clear don't go but he has a permissive will and you can work in that if you wish to and god will make it honoring but still it's not god's perfect will and that's what we should strive for his perfect will not his permissive will the kingdom of god which is in the earth today can never be set up justly on a permissive will so we can't strive that's why we don't pray for the united states of america we don't pay for the gut pray for the government and all those things that's all permissive we got to get to the perfect will of god which is which is the bride that has to come to rapturing faith that's what that should be our our goal and that should be our the whole function of our life sure we have life to live when we have things we're talking about backstage backstairs and uh we're life i love life and i you know we we don't sit in the closet we enjoy life but we don't let it overtake we don't let it overtake what we are you love the world things of the world the love of god's not in you but that love means just actually love it more than you love god and god will not allow that you can never be set up justly the kingdom on permissive will it's got to come back to his perfect will and it will amen all right let's look so now perfect will and permissive will and there's another thing called election all right i've always said election is very simple to me god voted for you the devil voted against you you swing the vote one more time for those of you that are asleep god god voted for you it's not that you're asleep over here they are i'm just leaving them alone then god voted for you the devil voted against you because he's got that vote against you but you swing the vote because it's going to be two to one one way or the other okay so there it goes back to choice again it's all in free moral agency it's uh you know god made a choice god is a free moral agent he doesn't need us to exist does he he does not need us to exist he chose he chose to have sons and daughters of god he had attributes that had to come out so he chose to be a father he chose to be a son he didn't have to come down here what law says he had to come down here none he could just let us just actually he just could say and we'd be gone and he'd just create another one but he didn't brother brown said in christ the mystery of god are real he had a plan and a purpose wow a plan god sat down and had a plan and a purpose and it's not like me and you making one his comes out right every time we hit miss a little while every once in a while but remember these two things and it'll kind of help you with the permissive and perfect will now the perfect will is that god saw it happen because it is a perfect will of god he saw he saw it happen he can't change that way this bible was written before the foundation of the world he couldn't write it any different when we got down here and physically wrote it he couldn't change his mind okay so the perfect will of god is his word and that's what he saw and that's what's going to happen now permissive will god let it happen see the difference perfect will is it's going to happen that's why predestinated is the promise when god made a promise he's not going to change it but the journey is the predestination destiny determined beforehand a destiny a journey a life so the permissive will of god he let it happen but he let it happen by one thing choice all goes back to choice but you say well brother wayne everybody preaches on predestination this and we're we're a predestinated seed and we're predestinated this only in god only in christ are we a predestinated save remember remember what brother brown said in the church age book he said it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from god but the seed or word this you weren't back there as little people running around in eternity they asked brother brown one time said what were we he said nothing and when a prophet says nothing he meant nothing even though he didn't say nothing he said nothing hallelujah he was a southerner so was paul that's the god and father of our lord jesus christ bless you all i'll say hallelujah again but listen so that permissive will was allowed of god because that's what brother brown said god allowed moses to do what he did and he backed him up by the water coming forth that's why you and i can work in the permissive will of god and remember he said and god will allow it and god will honor it hey listen we were born in permissive will we weren't supposed to be born by sex we were supposed to come sister lonnie sister brother sister bro we're supposed to come by the spoken word of god adam and eve but this is all permissive so this all permissive has got to go away to go back to his perfect will but the permissive had to be allowed to get us here after the fall this permissive will is now what god works in and sometimes we we you know we wonder god why um somebody dies suddenly somebody this i mean you wonder why you just don't know uh the only thing i can say is that i've always said this god's nose are the best yeses you'll ever get you've heard me say that before i'm gonna say it one more time for those of you that are asleep god's nose when god says no and you're praying about something and you know you come up to a place and it looks like you're many has done that i mean come right up to a wall you're like god this is what i want to do this looks perfect everything fits just fine that's god telling you no because he knows if he says yes and you continue down that road you're going to be worse hezekiah prime example right hezekiah you're going to die he sends a prophet to hezekiah and says hezekiah you're done you're finished get your stuff in order you're going to die thus saith the lord now watch his perfect will and his permissive will so hezekiah so he goes out hezekiah first thing he does he gets on his face and he says god i need more time but look what happened in hezekiah's life in that 15 years wasn't very good right he should have went ahead and died when he did there wouldn't have been a lot of this other things written about him so he he he he asked god and god allowed that prophet had to walk back in and say okay you got 15 more years or you're not going to die same way with god with you and i the permissive will of god we have to watch it we have to watch what we do because remember god's not going to make you do anything like we go back to the holy ghost even a born-again christian i'm talking about born in a christian born again christian he's not going to make you come to church but if the one that wrote it that forsake not assembling itself together if the one that wrote it is in you that part will connect we're going to get into that at the end of the sermon because that's what it's got to come back to it's got to come back to you seeing that this is what's in you there's the connection then i can say i am predestinated stamped sealed and delivered because that's the promise of god that somebody's going to do it you've just got to make sure that you decide you're the one that's going to do it like my old football coach said i've told you before lead follow or get out of the way i mean that's just that leave follow get out of the way don't hinder anybody i've always said that lord don't let me hinder people and my life probably does i say my life not my wife my life probably does but i want that to go away i want that permissive will to work to the perfect will of god see there brother chad i didn't throw you under the bus i got my wife this time you're well that hundred dollars helped y'all are just family we're talking family here we're just talking family it's just family a little family discussion but look he didn't make esau do anything but before there was a bible even written he knew when esau got here what he would do now that is foreknowledge so now we're going to raise it up a little bit and we're going to talk about the word for knowledge now the word for knowledge is very simple knowing beforehand knowledge beforehand for knowledge all right because excuse me for whom he did for new he also did predestinate so everybody wants to key on predestination and predestinated let's look at foreknowledge because that's where it all begins it begins in four knowledge because you can't have predestination without having foreknowledge oh i'm glad you're listening i don't see too many here too many demands you're either asleep or bored or we're not hungry yet processing that's good that's what i want you to do process listen let's go then let's let the prophet tell us then faith of abraham number two quote guys you know i want to say something here that that i don't say in many places but you've probably got one of the best support groups i've ever seen as far as your pastor with your deacons and with your elders and with your trustees with the brothers that do the work back in the back and i'm not giving glory to nobody i'm giving glory to god not one person but it does come from one man but i i just it's a it's a unit and it works and i'm not trying to build you up to like me i really don't care whether you like me or not because i know you do tell i'm sister jim's husband but you do you just and i i love being around you honestly i do i love being around you and i'd say this if i was somewhere else but i don't say that a lot of places but but you have you got a support group that's that's just second to none it's just in it you know what it does it makes me feel secure makes me feel secure you say well you don't even go to this church well yeah i do yeah i do i'll come here every time you do same holy ghost i gots here okay and i'm not saying that to glorify anybody i'm just telling you that it you should and you should pray for that and you should pray for the stability because we have a good support group in our church too and it's people working together and it it's like brother brown said don't be an organization but he said you can be an organism you can be annoying that's what this is it's an organism it works okay it works in the body of christ and i just i just feel it's a security blanket to me to know that someone is is is like-minded like my dad like brother like brother jim back here and and it's just and it's a testimony to all of you not just one person it's testimony to every one of you bringing it together and you know being an organism and it's wonderful so let's go back to here i just want to say that but i love everyone with love and lord faith of abraham number two got it and predestination is a hard word among a congregation of people because predestination really for knowledge is a better word now let's preach on four knowledge if foreign is a better word let's preach on four knowledge let's let's not forget predestination are predestinated but let's look at foreign knowledge that's what he said really foreknowledge is a better word and predestination looks back to foreknowledge god can't have foreknowledge without i mean can't have predestination without having four knowledge first those he foreknew he did predestinate not that god predestinated and that's it in a box like we're going to read in a minute brother ram says god didn't put you in a tube and pull you through it no he foreign knew what you would do when you got here your desires remember god doesn't even predestination by his desires he desired that everybody be saved god in his infinite mind does not want one person lost he's that kind of a god but he knows there's going to be a group and he knows he has to be a judge so that attribute is in him to be a judge so he has to have something to judge okay so god didn't even predestinate remember the prophecy that god predestinates by your desires right by your own desires god predestinate why he foreknew what you would do not make you do it everybody got me now foreknowledge is first then predestination can come into view so those he foreknew he did predestinate and so yes sir absolutely he knew jim pinkton would come on the earth and all the life that he would live but he knew he would come right here redemption but he knew maybe his partner in in school that was a roommate that that was close to him took a different path never would come to god if god gave him a million years he was always going to go in that direction everybody see that now all right let's continue to reading really for knowledge is a better word and predestination looks back to foreknowledge foreknowledge looks to destiny i'm going to explain foreknowledge looks to destiny because he already foreign knew what you were going to do so he can look down through time see what you're know what he knows what you're going to do he don't think what you're going to do he knows what you're going to do so therefore he can set your destiny but not by him making the choice or you do away before knowledge everybody got that so it's not that god pulled you through a tube but he saw your destiny beforehand so that's predestination so if you can say predestination and then look at foreknowledge i'm okay with it but not just that i'm this predestinated seed it doesn't matter what i do i can do what i want to that's what the people the the millennium people are preaching we're already in the millennium take them to a zoo put them in with the lines you'll find out real quick you're not in a millennium because we're supposed to yeah anyway kind of stupid but anyway that god being infinite in the beginning knew the end from the beginning therefore he knew what people would do i'm reading a quote so he could foretell jacob have i loved he saw have i hated jeremiah before you were formed in your womb see so so what brother branham was doing in an unlearned group of people if you just preach predestination as destiny determined beforehand then that means you haven't got anything to do with it that's why he said don't use predestination but now foreign knowledge god knowing what you would do he set your destiny because predestination is in the bible so we got to use it so it's not a bad word brother brown says here it's a bad word but later on he's going to say it's not so bad a word all right let's keep reading excuse me faith of abraham let's read the e 20 paragraph therefore he by election he chose abraham for he knew for he knew what abraham would do i believe god called many people besides abraham i believe god called people beside elijah i think he called people beside isaiah he called people beside noah if not he's a respecter of persons i believe he called people but they didn't respond abraham was the only one that responded so god in his infinite mind knew that but when he come to abraham abraham didn't know that i don't think abraham realized a lot of things i i don't believe he was well i'm going to wake up today and be the father of the faith no he woke up hungry and was looking for sarah to fix him something to eat and then he picks up lot and then he picks up this one and he does part what god said doesn't that kind of fit our bill today abraham didn't do exactly what god said but now did god not bless abraham no he blessed abraham all right and there's a little point there that we'll say for later therefore he by election he chose abraham for he knew what abraham would do you remember when he called him out there and he did not keep the things a secret from him when he was going down to destroy sodom and gomorrah he said for i know that abraham will teach his children you know i like that brother brown said the reason he called abraham and the reason he liked abraham he knew abraham would not keep a secret what went on in his life he would tell his children and his children's children down through the generation all right god himself will teach his children i know it god himself i know that abraham will send this message on down from one to the other generation well that's wonderful so let's read this god's covenant confirmed just read the are they putting up the black part are you putting up the whole thing okay well i'm reading down a little bit lower than that okay so i'll just read let's just read the whole thing god's covenant with abraham then e15 paragraph 15. now jesus didn't come to calvary just for a haphazard thought well i'll die up there and perhaps somebody will feel sorry now see that's that's most people now my dad has a methodist minister that's a his brother and natural brother and that's what he believes he believed that god just thought somebody feels sorry for him and we hear we see the quotes of brother branham but this is a physical man that preaches in his church jesus just came here felt hoping somebody feel sorry for him dying and it gets saved well now he's from georgia sorry but i mean that's what he thinks and that's why hey you go ask people go ask them say why did jesus die well well some he thought i'd feel sorry for him and get saved no he came down here for a purpose because he knew by for knowledge what would happen when he got here to me that's the most simple thing in the world is for knowledge and predestination all right so let's read now jesus didn't come to calvary just for a haphazard thought well i'll die up there perhaps maybe somebody will feel sorry for me and come down and get saved no no god don't run his office like that you don't run your office like that jesus come for one specific purpose that was to redeem those that god what oh not that he predestinated he foreknew would be redeemed see now god's not willing that any should perish but that all would come to repentance but in order to be god he had to know now the word predestinate as is used in ephesians 1 5 predestinate there isn't a good word it means in speaking of predestination to the people sometimes leads them to think that god just predestinated you to push you through a little pipe or something that's not right predestination looks back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks to destiny because if he didn't know what was going to happen he couldn't predestinate he would be finite like me and you he knew exactly how many kids he was going to have he knew how many people was going to love him he knew how many people was going to hate him you say well that's predetermined it's predetermined by fore-knowing by for knowing what would happen when he got here or when you got here or when hitler got here or when whoever you so if you'll simply leave it as foreknowledge he foreign you this before it ever happened all right so you can put there and see that how god didn't pull you through a tube he didn't make you do anything but he foreknew what you do when you got here my uh uh my grandpa he my dad was my grandpa was 64 when my dad was born praise the lord and pretty strong guy fathered four people in his sixties four children in the sixties set of twins and my dad so anyway so he was out picking cotton with with grandma one day and and they were talking about predestination and this true story grandma told it so they were picking cotton and said he said her name was hannah so he said han said hand does god know i'm gonna pick a bowl of cotton right there she said sure he does so he walks around it he thinks he's pulling something over on god but she says sam he knew you were going to do that he foreign knew that you were going to walk around it you're not you see that sometimes that's our mentality you know well predestination is just it's not now predestinated to a promise is signed sealed and delivered because god knows who that's going to be and you've got but the only way we've got to do it to get back is by his perfect will all right this right here this is what's going to put us back to that connection with god because his will is his word and it's his perfect will and his will will come to pass nothing we can do about that it will come to pass but you've got to decide whether you want to be a part of that or not this may be so simple that you just fall asleep but to me it's profound that that that for knowledge come first those who he foreknew he did predestinate in his mind it stamped sealed and delivered because he's infinite but you and i are finite we have our problems in life we have things that we do but you know god knows every one of them and i thought that was a funny analogy that you know he said walks around the bowl of cotton you know it's like he's pulling something over on god she said honey god knew you wasn't going to pick it so that's and but that's the way what sometimes our mentality is but it wants to get away from that i want us to get away that god is not finite god is infinite he knew what you would do if you'd never heard of this message or he's or he's finite but now that you have come into the promise does everybody understand when you've come into the promise and connected yourself to the promise then you are predestinated predestinated is the promise predestination is your journey to get to the promise you receive the promise of the holy ghost right to your children them that are far off all right let's keep reading for just a second and foreknowledge looks to destiny let's read paragraph 16. therefore god being god before the foundation of the world knew that who would be saved and who would not so like i said he knew that's it but we don't know all right romans 8 he could say that he hated esau and loved jacob before either child was born by foreknowledge he'd know that a little shyster that esau would be and how he would save jacob so therefore by foreknowledge god knew these things for knowledge god knew these things but now you know look at the life of jacob mesa who would you pick if you were writing a commentary and you were walk you walked into their house and you looked at the two sons who would you pick he called esau shyster i think jacob was a pretty good one but remember he had respect to one thing the promise or the birthright he it was a birthright we can type that with the holy ghost but you know what it wasn't that to jacob it was just a first blessing wasn't anything to him going to heaven or not it was just the first blessing he was wanting he wanted that blessing from his father so he did what he did and boy to look at the commentary you would say he saw how i loved and jacob have i hated but remember jacob and esau watch their life esau had no respect for the birthright jacob had respect for the birthright jim pinson had respect for the holy ghost xyz did not so you can see that you know you wonder you and i've told you many times i think i've told you here sitting in the airport in atlanta you just see thousands of people walking by and you know i just one day i said lord why not them why not them well you know you see people walking by all walks of life and and some rich and some poor and some you know they're just running back and forth you know trying to get on the flight and all these things and i thought lord why me and not them you know what he spoke to me and said you chose and i and they didn't see it comes down to one thing you chose that's what he said to me he said you chose me and they didn't for knowledge not predestinated for knowledge he foreknew that i would want it when i got here not that he was just going to give it to me because i was good because listen i'm a pretty good guy jim don't do that don't don't just don't okay i'll say i'm a pretty good guy i don't need your opinion no i'm just kidding no i'm a pretty good guy but you know in god's eyes i'm dead we can't even go before god himself as a person in this way we are now even born again brother braham said one second in front of god in these sinful bodies were annihilated right wow so we depend on that blood covering but have you ever read a i preached on a little sermon on the book of books and you have to see that even in judgment when you're standing in judgment what makes you better than the person that we're going to judge because the bible says the bible says that the books were open and they were judged by their works foolish virgin anybody that comes to the white throne judgment has got to be judged by their works i do not ever want to be judged by my my works never do i want to go on my works but now remember faith and works go together you you those two will coincide but i don't ever want to go before god with my works in front of me because we accepted christ we accepted his sacrifice now there's the predestinated predestinated chosen in him i read in ephesians chosen in him not by him or for it we were chosen in him if i can stay in christ then i have no words i'm judged by his works amen hallelujah if not when we go before judgment you pass this life without the new birth you're going to be judged by the works you did on this earth and i don't even want to be judged even standing in a pulpit because there's bad thoughts go through my brain so i want his works i want to get in that predestinated group of people you say well don't you know well yeah i do now but i didn't before i don't have four knowledge oh we can think of something we're gonna do tomorrow i'm gonna fly out tomorrow four o'clock something could happen but with god that's not true he's not gonna go you know god's not nervous he don't you don't have a you know he just doesn't we get all nervous about well god what are you gonna do well he's gonna play going i know what i'm gonna do i knew it before you got here what i was gonna do what you were gonna do but see we might sometimes we make god so uh so human which he was but still he's he's infinite so he's all-knowing he knows everything you know we pull a little crooked deal or we or we say a little something about this one or something about that when you saw nobody heard me oh yeah they did there's about 10 million angels heard it and it was wrote in a book somewhere and i think god's got it now so you don't think you can hide therefore god being god before the foundational world knew who would be saved and who would not that's romans 8 all right let's go to number four we will see jesus dallas texas 1958 now the world won't see no matter there's people born we hate to say this there's people that were born to eternal destruction how not by predestination or he has chose them and not me respect your persons but by for knowledge i keep going over here because this is the mind of god we're we won't have time for that but in you in the mind of god i don't want to be you say well well i want to be in the mind of god judas was in the mind of god you've got to become a part of the mind you got to become a part of the thinker that means when it says in christ yeah i know you're chewing on that a man that's fine chewing that a while i don't want to be thought of judas was thought of jesus called him friend but i want to be part of the thinker i want i want to be so much a part of this one that thought of me that by foreknowledge he knew that my nights and days and that all the things that i did was was for him all right so listen to this we will see jesus now let's take this there's people born we hate to say this that they're born to eternal destruction by for knowledge i'm not adding to the word i'm telling you exactly what he's saying because watch what he says because look scripture says so romans 8 before esau or jacob was ever born or come from their mother's womb god said i hate esau and love jacob before either child had a chance god by not by predestination by his will you reading that make you think about predestination a little bit different from now not predestination by his will but by his foreknowledge he knew that esau was a shyster to begin with excuse that expression but that just means a renegade so that's what he was and god by foreknowledge knew it and some people no matter what you would do they'll still disbelieve it but god's just he keeps his word all right let's go to number four again book of exodus 1955 the word predestinate that's not a good word to use the word foreknowledge is better now how many times have you heard him say that now you're going to hear him say it a lot now foreknowledge is better predestination looks back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks to destination as simple as it can be but god not making set in order a little hole that you have to go through and can't go no other way you see that and can't go no other way that's not what god did but god in order to be god he'd know then from the beginning so he could predict it and set things in order to happen okay now notice by god's wise providence he had revealed by spiritual revelation that this was going to be his chosen vessel and his mother wasn't the scared of the king's commandment for by faith he saw him with the children of israel placing them over in the promised land talking about moses all right let's read where i think pentecost failed 1955 11-11 but if we only go back find out when god made his first man he made him in his own image and god is a spirit so he had to make spirit man now the word is used here in the fifth verse of predestination predestinated it's not a very good word for an evangelist or a minister to use because this kind of confuses the people when you say predestinate predestination speaks looks back to foreknowledge for knowledge looks to destination predestination goes back to for knowledge so for knowledge has got to be first for knowledge has got to be first predestination goes back to foreknowledge for knowledge goes to destination all right now let's read number five questions and answers 1959 the question asked now let's see now the next one here what is meant by predestination before the world begin where is it in the bible predestination before the world began all right my precious brother let's turn to ephesians first he goes to ephesians 1. now the first thing i want to say this that predestination is a bad word for a minister to use before an untrained congregation see it is i don't use it sometimes here at the church but out in the audience out in the big places in other words where everything's piled from everywhere i watch that word i always use the word for knowledge because predestination is only the foreknowledge of god that's what it is it's the foreknowledge of god that's what predestination totally consists of is the foreknowledge of god if he can't foreknow anything he cannot predestinate but by the way he can foreknow everything he can predestinate all right that's what scripture says all right i always use the word for knowledge because predestination is only the foreknowledge of god god being infinite by foreknowledge he knew everything or he wasn't infinite all right number six ephesians parallels joshua 1960 listen to this it's what he said listen to this predestination looks back to foreknowledge i mean election he brings election in now because the bible does say elect huh if you read the scripture in peter we'll read it in just a minute elect according to what for knowledge of god that's the only way you're elected is god for knew you were going to choose him or the devil there's only two choices all right the only two spirits that we got to deal with listen to this but now watch and i want to i want to interject something here just just for a moment i i've never talked to brother jim about this but but i want to kind of let you know how i feel about it is everybody brings to the message that we were born with this seed in us and we were born with this eternal life and we i can't see that based on what people say is being a seed or a spot or a and i know brother brown says you were born with a seed in you i thought the bible says the seed is the word now look and who is this melchizedek brother brown said we bypass the word to become flesh we bypass our theophany jesus came word that's what made us different that's why when he was looking at nicodemus he said nicodemus you need to be born again i was born right you need to be born the way i was born he said be born from above all right so i just can't go with that i'm sorry because i know i was born in sin shape and iniquity a spouse of my mother's womb a liar i i needed to receive eternal life if i came here with it jesus didn't have to die i'm glad you're really thinking about this because i don't want i don't want us as believers to get to the point where say well i don't need nothing i was always this and i was always that doesn't matter what i do and that's what they do when they bring in that doctrine of we can have polygamy or we can have this we can have that we always was yeah in god you always were because of his foreknowledge you always were son and daughter of god if you ever were one you were one back there you had to come down here to realize it but you were born in sin shaping an iniquity i don't see how permissive will and perfect will came together except it's a new birth because if we were born right the first time why do you need a second birth you understand what i'm saying we got all the quotes flying around you know and i believe if you look at it the correct way you always were eternal you not you come on people this wasn't eternal this had a beginning and it'll have an end but i wasn't this if i came with the seed of eternal life in me then that's a respecter of persons that's just the way i see it i'm sorry the bible says after you received the gospel of your salvation after you received this after you received that we had to receive something when i was doing the things of the world god was nowhere to be seen in my life but one day there was something sure enough was laying there but what was it laying in here or was it laying in here see if you put it laying in here and then you respond to that that's the foreknowledge of god he put this here this is predestinated eternally from god remember what he said this right here the word of god the word is a seed so i can't say i was born special if i do then god's going to have to say adolf hitler was born special i just like to see that i knew i was a sinner and if i didn't accept christ i was gone that's just the way i see it or you take salvation all the way out of the picture i like to know that somebody died for me and it was almighty god because you know what by foreign knowledge though he knew i would want it so we had it there when i needed it not that it developed it was there but where was it was it in me or was it what did you respond to i responded to a man preaching a sermon the ethiopian eunuch now if the ethiopian unit was always was eternal why did he need philip why did he need philip philip had the seed because he was already born again he comes down and talks to the ethiopian eunuch and god revealed the word remember everybody understand what i'm saying what i want to do is i don't want to start a doctrine i just want to tell you that i knew i was lost i needed a savior i needed somebody to message or no message there's going to be billions of people in this world that never heard of william brennan that are going to be saved sanctified and filled with the holy ghost not now but back in the church ages they ever knew who william branham was or the message the pentecostals azusa street brother brown was just a baby so there's going to be billions of people that's not going to be there because of the message but you and i are a special group of people we have a special token it's not different but it's special because we're taking hours right up to that position right here wesley luther couldn't get there they had their point that they got to just shall live by faith live a good clean life but you and i are predestinated to a rapture that's what i end up with you're predestinated to a rapture that's the predestination that's that spot i was talking about before and it's your choice whether you get there or not you say oh i'm insufficient i'm this i'm there moses said the same thing moses said god i can't even talk good he must have been a southerner he said i can't talk well because i said don't worry i've already got that taken care of you just tell aaron and aaron must be able to speak very well he can he can he can he can do the talking but see god had a provision there but i want you to see that that god by foreknowledge knew you would want it and he had it there for you is that just too simple but by foreknowledge he knew you would want it more than the other guy at walmart or the girl or or your family member or some we we always we worry about those things in our mind we say god why me just like i said you sit there and you watch these people that has i mean they go out of your life in a few seconds but they have no purpose they have no we know what their end is but they don't they're working themselves to death and they're worrying about this and worrying about that and here they go through the airport never see them again but you know they're going to a to a place of work or a place or a home or a family you say well god why me why why me and he just spoke to me and he said well you chose me and they didn't you say oh brother i'm saying you didn't have anything to do with it well no you didn't yeah you did no you didn't but yeah you did you had to accept because god came down to me one day and he said do you want to be my child and i accept it and he knew that before the foundation of the world and i went to an altar and i got my sins put in the sea of god's forgetfulness never to be remembered again but you know what god already knew that because he had it ready for me because by foreign knowledge he knew that day would come same way with you if you ever come to god that's the same place that he saw you before the foundation of the world that's the spot he saw you now then after we become a christian like i said we have doors and doors we have things like that but let's let me read a couple more quotes and then we'll then we'll finish right here let's read let's skip over to jehovah gyra it's number eight guys at grass valley california brother brown said now there's a doctrine of predestination which is rotten nonsense but there really is true predestination god by foreknowledge could predestinate because he has foreknowledge god's not willing that any should perish but being the infinite god knew that who would perish and who would not that's the reason he said before isaac or before jacob and esau was born he hated he saw and loved jacob his foreknowledge let him know that esau was a shyster and let him know that jacob respected that birthright regardless of how he got it he wanted it now the both boys twins born from the same holy mother and father so that takes your seedline out of the way there he jacob wasn't born this good seed in east all born of bad seed they both was born from a good seed right right isaac right they were born from the same mom and daddy all right but it was the choice they made i then now let's go to number nine this will be the last one blasphemous names a little close now watch brother 1962. paragraph 26 i want everybody to see this here we go keep it going there you go i believe there is a bride that's predestinated i believe god said he would have a church without spot or wrinkle i believe in predestination that the bride is predestinated she's got to be there i hope i'm with her that see i'm with her now it's up to me to work out my own salvation with god until these things are approved of god are you reading this with me and then sealed into the kingdom of god and then sealed into the kingdom of god you read that okay there's the holy spirit there's the genuine works of god it's sealed until the day of redemption and then he was talking about this dream now paragraph 26-3 now therefore when she does that when that church comes to that place or the individual the church is going to be there let me say it real good so you can get it the church is predestinated to be there i want to be with it but the only way i'll be with it is to be a part of it how do i become a part of it by being in it how do i get in it by baptism by one spirit first corinthians 12 by one spirit we're all baptized into one body one body baptized into that body amen for knowledge of god the foreknowledge is first that's the first thing then you got predestination and the predestinated because predestination is the journey does everybody understand i'm going to say it again yeah i've said it 15 times so that was about three so i got about 15 12 13 more but predestination is the journey he sees the journey he sees what you do if you this one or this one or this one i told him up in virginia not too long ago i said you know i said the civil war was fought mostly in virginia georgia tennessee uh places like that and there were six hundred thousand men killed in the civil war six hundred thousand men so unless they and they were usually young men there were six hundred thousand men killed so that was six hundred thousand generations that were stopped have you thought about that that's 600 000 generations if they didn't have children that were stopped now you can rest assured one thing you weren't in that 600 000. you were not found in that group there was a many stories told up there of of the great great great grandfathers that that you know a bullet would crease you know increase their cheap but the guy over here got killed see that's god's providence he's getting you here brother brown said he bred this one to this one this one to this one this one to this one to get you here he put those characters together because he knew what you'd be when you got here that's the foreknowledge of god he foreign knew what kind of character you'd have and so the perfect will of god just worked right down into the permissive will down here just works right down and then guess what to get you here and to love him and become a part of him then go back in that redemption redemption is not replacement this gets lost this has got to come back right so you were lost and you had to come back and that's what we're getting to but remember it's for knowledge you say well i'm predestinated be careful just want you to think about that just be careful because judas was predestinated too adolf hitler was predestinated too all the ones that's going to go to hell were predestinated so be careful when you say i'm predestinated but if you take foreknowledge and know that now you have the mind of god you can look back and say god you foreknew me like jesus said i had pleasure with you father before the foundation of the world and job says where were you when when the morning started saying together and the sons of god shout out for joy we weren't back there as people we were back there in the attribute of god that i i when i was a father wanted to have children because that made you know to make me a father i had to have kids so i want to be a father but i didn't know because i'm finite i did not know how many i was going to have but god being infinite he knew how many he was going to have so he was overjoyed that jim pinkston was going to be here in the last stage and take a body change he was overjoyed jim and and sister darlene and all of you everybody got together and you come here and my could we not stand up and tell how our journey got us here well that was the predestination of god but it was by foreknowledge he knew you would do when he presented it to you he knew what you'd do with it he knew how you would handle it some can't handle that we were talking some can only handle milk but you know what i like a little milk but i like a steak too and crab legs and all the other things that go with it i like all that but i do like a good cold glass of milk every once in a while so don't throw the milk out don't throw the baby out with the bath water you know you got to take the milk but i like some milk with some steak i can't just live off of milk i have to live off something that because you know what god wants us this is my last statement god wants us to be just like him he wants us to be just like him you say i can't do that well guess what you can't if you say you can't then you can't i can't be this why you sisters have the same god in you that we have now according listen according to what happened in the fall you can't be a preacher you can't handle the word like we handle the word but now remember before the fall adam and eve were equal you sisters should say amen sure were getting back to that now but but before the fall they were equal it's not going to be the sisters are going to have to just all scurry over to one side when us men walk in the future home no we're all going to have the same place we're all going to enjoy the same things we're all going to be equal all going to be equal but your sisters have a place you have to play but you have the same holy ghost i do or we're different but you do and your sisters you need to be your own have your own pulpit at home and do the things of god that that you need to do be a good wife be a be a good mother to your children if you don't have children just be a good mother to somebody else's children you know just just be a mother that's right absolutely and you deacons you ought to take care of the widows and the orphans poor little orphans around here bless their heart andy and ashley bless their heart somebody's got to be it but look you love the lord but the foreknowledge of god it's where it's at before knowledge god could predestinate this whole thing and it work out to his perfect will and you but you and i though it's the choice that we made is what determines that predestination you don't know it you don't know what tomorrow holds but you know who holds tomorrow and if we lean on our own will own understanding we're going to mess up but why not lean on the one that knows what tomorrow's going to be and if god says no take that as the best yes you'll ever get if he says uh-uh then he knows you're going to mess up if you go down that road so say okay god i'm gonna try this way and then try this way but we're all free moral agents we can do what we want to do god will never push eternal life on anybody he will not but we go back to election elect according to the foreknowledge of god how are you included in the election god voted for you the devil voted against you you swing the vote let's stand you love the lord then you gotta love me but there's something that we need to all work on and that's to be closer to god to do more of his perfect will well his perfect will's his word brother bryan said how are you going to get closer to god well you need to pray fast lay on the ground let the mule drag you through the field he said read your bible and pray so what you're doing is you're reading your will you're reading your will this is the perfect will of god i've got to decide whether i connect with that or not but when i do connect with it he can't lose me brother chad he can't lose me once i connect never will i be lost again once i connect to the to him because he can't he won't throw you away i guarantee you he'll try you if you sent a sin the prophet said you're going to reap a tub for but you know what the prodigal son when he went out he was a son he was a son he was part of the family when he went out he just what did he do he made a choice so let's now all choose make our choices you say god you know what choice i'm going to make now make it work to your perfect will make it work because you know how this thing's going to end up but i don't that makes me inefficient but he is so efficient we just look to the efficient one the one that knows all things knew it before he got here never had a crisis meeting never had a nervous moment in his life never god's not even a second older than he was when he thought all this how infinite is that let's bow our heads to emily father we pray lord that you take these words that have been spoken lord and ill strike to the heart of believers because you said lord you would send the holy ghost back to be the comforter and that you would tell us the things that you said and even show us things to come lord i pray father that you would just be with these people lord bless them in their life's journey and lord i know we all have struggles and trials and temptations and those two hundred thousand thousand demons are trained right here on us today but lord you promised a predestinated bride and when you promise a predestinated bride then we are going to be there you promised lord that in the end time we were going to be a people that would take a body change in a rapture called the dead saints out of the ground something's never been done since time began lord we got a big responsibility ahead of us but lord let us take that challenge pull out that sword of faith take that shield and be shod with the preparation of the gospel and lord you told us through the prophet that footprints means possession so everywhere these feet go lord we see redemption we see when we wash each other's feet jesus said do this till i come it shows redemption all the people that washed his feet the little prostitute washed your feet one time lord and you told her sins were forgiven lord i pray that everywhere we walk that our possession lord is centered around you not centered around our own self our own self will our own self ideas but lord they'll be around you father and that you'll condemn any sickness it's among us lord that you take those things away bless brother buddy take care of him lord we ask just be with him or strengthen him take care of each one lord here that's sick that we don't know about lord you know all things you knew it before the world began and you knew whether they'd ask for for you lord just right now to heal them father and to heal the sick of spirit lord and not just only the sick of body lord did we at all get rid of the things that we that we carry that paul said that that sin that weight that so easily besets us lord we'd run with patience looking toward the author and finisher of our faith lord knowing that you know who's going to make it and who don't but we don't but lord we strive if we if we look at your perfect will and we see our name lord we see that we're doing the right things and we're covered by your blood lord that we won't have to stand in that judgment by our own silly works the stupid things we do on this earth lord but we'll look to you father the perfect one the one that knows all things lord i pray that you just sanctify these people for the journey be with each one of us lord take care of us lead us in god us by your holy spirit lord jesus name we pray amen and also i want to remind you one thing i'm not praying for rain anymore okay bro jim sent me a text the other day and he said you can stop praying now i said look i only prayed one prayer but i told him i said the bible did say it was a sound of abundance of rain that's right and he wrote me back about two days later he said we have now had the abundance but you know it's that's another thing you know god knew that before the foundation of the world but now he didn't just come down and say i'm going to give them people rain no he had to find a vessel and i'm not saying anything for me it happened to all of us speak the word the prophet said and go forward speak the word and watch it but it just you know what it done it got into me that you guys were having a bad problem with a drought what anything to me i don't live here but i could see the animals the trees and how your your foundations of your house you were even having to you know wet them and keep it from cracking and all these things well you know that costs money and that that involves all of us because we all live in a house i hope but jim and i lived in a barn for a little while but that's okay but that was what came on my heart was that you were suffering and if you're god's kids what more dad would go no i don't think i'm gonna help them i think i'll just let them know he wants to help everybody and that just struck in my heart and that prayer like i said i just prayed that one prayer and i said lord it's gonna you know just it'll happen but you had to believe it too and you got your reign that's right and you got an abundance of rain but it didn't kill nobody well y'all everybody's okay so but you know what do that same thing for your kids do that same thing for your husband that's not a believer for a wife is not a believer saying that same that same thing that comes in and says i am so burdened you ever get a burden for somebody wake up in the middle of night you know what you better pray for that person you say well why do i need to pray for that person he's got the holy ghost god don't work that way if we'll realize one thing god wants you to be god god wants you to be god he knows he's god he wants you to be god that's something to chew on because remember adam had control of the whole earth and that's what you were going to have if you would have come without a fault didn't like that tree you could just do that in the tree and move over come on now be wonderful now if you could do that go to a restaurant and be full and go you know but you know god's not that carnal i'm just making a joke but still though it's the desire of your heart right you ever seen god come to the desire of your heart and just give you that but you know sometimes he says no well that's the best yes did anybody ever said that before that's the best yes yeah that's the best yes god i ever give you is to say no that i don't think that's gonna work you may think it will but it's not gonna work i promise trust me it's not gonna work i've already seen it happen but see we take the will of god and just become a group of people that just binds together and and if one's got a need you know you you don't have to make needs known all the time i i can feel needs for my congregation i know people when people are struggling you don't have to have discernment you can understand by conversation and by the way they act and stuff so you know be aware what i'm saying is be aware god wants you to be god he wants you to be able to handle things we got a big god he can handle everything but he wants but why did he wake me up to pray for brother bud he wanted a connection there god wanted me to he god want he want to go you got something to do with this why does he put a preacher up here why don't y'all just sit home you got the you got the quotes just like we do you got to buy am i got a bible at home or a knife or an ipad you know this thing doesn't need batteries just kidding i'll have one sooner or later but i like this one because the batteries don't run out you can flip the pages but everybody's got that why do we need to come to church that's what he said in here we need to assemble ourselves together and more so and more so a lot of people don't think the day's approaching i guess because he said more so as the day approaches lord bless each and every one of you we love you with the love of the lord pray for us we'll be leaving tomorrow about four o'clock and uh maybe we'll get back here before the end of the year who knows i think we're going to do something brother claude's the end of the year in december so we'll see but uh love you man appreciate you appreciate you man appreciate all of you amen well you're not going to have to he said chew on this he's uh we're sharing a a statement about god wants you to be god you're not going to have to chew on it alone because that's our subject for wednesday night if we've been talking about equality for quite a while and so we'll get back into psalms psalms 82 where god standeth in the congregation of the gods and judgeth among the elohim so uh right there in the scripture let me just say this i know it's a little bit late but let me just say this one thing brother bannon for 16 years of the opening of the seals i believe his um the theme of brother adam's ministry was predestination it really was because he laid into it over and over and over there are perhaps more religious volumes of doctrine that have been written and more sermons on predestination than perhaps anything else among the religious world and so there are just there's so many ways you can go but it and i understand why brother branham said predestination is not a good word he's not saying it like stay away from it but it's not a good word to use in a congregation like he said of the untrained see because that's just part of the equation one of the most familiar scriptures among all of us is romans 8 28. all things work together for good uh to them that love the lord now watch and are called that's part of it according to his purpose that's a part of it then he goes down to verse 29 it says for assume he for whom he has foreknown that's the third part he hath predestinated that's the fourth part to be conformed to the image of his son and that's what we're talking about so you got four parts there then he goes on in verse 30 it says for whom he has predestinated he's also justified there's the fifth part and then for whom he has justified then he is also glorified so there's the sixth part so it's one it's it's one enormous subject and there's just no way you can in an hour hour and a half give really any uh uh well what's the word i'm looking for and it works to cover it all you can touch this and that and this and that and this and that and then try to try to make it connect and in your notes in your mind you know you're connecting it all but you've been preaching on it your dad's been how long on it all right eight sermon and he probably just now getting into it didn't he they probably just they just got see so you can take it and go just forever on it you really can and it's just a huge huge subject and so we may comment uh on some of those things wednesday night as we incorporate it into uh our continuing series on equality but i appreciate the truth of the word i appreciate brother delivering his soul to us today and so we're thankful for that amen let's bow our heads just in a word of prayer as we dismiss today father um we're thankful for the truth of the uh predestination that as we understand it as has been brought to us and and cleared up for us by the prophet of god and so help us now just to go forth from here and meditate upon these things and give consideration lord to the things that were said and may it uh continue to strengthen us and to aid us and to help us in this uh journey from our birth to a body change lord so as we're dismissed today may the may the uh spirit of the lord be with us and upon us and keep us in the center of your will as we go we'll ask in the name of the lord jesus christ all of god's people said amen god bless you may be dismissed uh normally i'd say let's continue singing but we haven't even sung have we but that's all right you know david sang psalms and it turned out to be scriptures and so i guess brother wade could have sang the scriptures that he read and it would have been just as valid amen because all the scripture is is uh all the psalms are is it just uh words with tunes to it so amen let god uh let god fill your heart with the psalms and the and uh the word of the air god bless you is your dismiss take the name of jesus with you as you go god bless you
