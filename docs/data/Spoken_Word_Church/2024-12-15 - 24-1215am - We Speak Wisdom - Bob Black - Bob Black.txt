========================================

let's just bow our heads in our hearts while they're getting the slides up Lord we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word this morning and our hearts are in great expectation for what you have for us today I pray God that you'll prepare us Lord to receive Lord and guide us through these scriptures Lord Jesus guide us through the day Lord and we ask Lord that you'll just feel welcome to be with us Lord make this day a special day we pray be with brother William and as he's preparing Lord and and uh on on the road to come here Lord and be with us Lord in a special way we ask in your name amen so we've been studying uh through the book of of Corinthians and we're on um chapter 2 and so just want to kind of continue our thought of of what Paul is talking about wisdom and and so last Sunday we were uh you know Paul said I I I didn't in at the beginning of this chapter I didn't come to you with enticing words but I come to you with the power and demonstration of the spirit and you know in chapter one he was laying out that the power of God is not so much um you don't get your identity from uh from really from anything other than the word of God that the word of God the preaching of the Gospel is the power of God because the preaching of the Gospel will we'll actually will'll change your and we as we'll see at the end of this chapter Paul starts talking about we let's let's have the mind of Christ that as the as the word Goes Forth it begins to change the way that you think and then as you as you the way that you think changes then your character changes and then the message identification brother Brown would actually say the mind of Christ the mind your mind is your character so as think about what a powerful thought that is that as the words going forth is claiming your claiming claiming your thinking and changing your thinking and then the way that you think is the way that you are and so your character is being changed by the words that you hear so then that makes what Paul says here we speak wisdom a lot more profound doesn't it that we're not just speaking words that come from a a seminary or from Greek philosophers or anything like that but we're actually speaking something that will change your life so in verse four just to continue on he said my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our Glory now say now he's not talking about you know when you read the message sometimes brother Brown will refer to wisdom and we'll read some quotes it's there's there's a a a worldly wisdom there's wisdom that you know they call Street smks things how to how to deal with you know how to how to invest in stock and those kind whatever how to how to survive on the streets of Cleveland how to how to how to do but but this is talking about wisdom that can only come from from God and wisdom wisdom is putting the pieces together to know how to interact with how how it elevates it from off the page to how how to deal with situations in your life how to deal with people that you work with how to deal with your family how to how to raise your children that's wisdom and not not just no book learning but wisdom on what do I do and and so uh this this is what Paul's talking about Divine wisdom is god-given in Proverbs 9:10 says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of the wi of wisdom so if you want wisdom start off by uh by by having a right uh regard for God and the knowledge of the Holy is understanding the knowledge of the Holy is understanding so brother Brown would say and the world is falling apart he'd say worldly wisdom and I put worldly in quote in quotes there he didn't say worldly but you can see if you kind of quantify that that's what he's talking about he's not talking about Godly wisdom he's talking about the wisdom of the world wisdom always takes you away from God but faith that wisdom that Paul's talking about brings you back to God right you don't know God by your own wisdom by your great wisdom your your intellectual mind you're thinking it's no good it's of the world it's foolishness to God but it pleased God through the foolishness of preaching his word to save the lost now ain't that what Paul's talking about the the power of God is the preaching of the Gospel to change the way that we think and to mold our character to be like Christ see so God always use something foolish and simple in Proverbs chapter 24 it says through wisdom is an house builded and by understanding it is established of course the wisest man on Earth Solomon built the Tabernacle and and this is what he's talking about that wisdom wisdom built that Temple that Solomon built and wisdom is building this Tabernacle that we've got represented on the wall back here that Christ is actually building like like like Peter would say um uh you are Lively Stones buil you're you're being built up a house and and and you're being built up by wisdom by Divine communication from God and the fifth so so what is true true wisdom is rooted in humility and the Simplicity of faith not intellectual pride in the fifth seal brother rown would say wise misses it far by their wisdom going farther from him by trying to find him by wisdom now don't forget that that'll be tape see the wise in their wisdom go so far to try to find him by their wisdom they miss him see if they could be big enough to be simple enough they can find him if you're big enough to get simple enough how simple simple enough to go look in a Manger simple enough to you know when brother R preached that the sermon Christ revealed Christ hidden in simp he's hidden in Simplicity revealed in the same that he's hidden in Simplicity something so simple that you're the wise people Overlook the Simplicity of the fact that God could guide himself in you that's get down so simple where God can Tabernacle himself behind Badger skins and and that wisdom of the world overlooks that because they're looking for him to be tabernacled behind stained glass windows and and gold and fine things that's so simple that God can come down and dwell in you now now there's what Paul is talking about in verse 7 but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our Glory let's see if I can make this play got a little animation here now there there's what it's just to illustrate what a mystery a mystery is like it's something that's hidden but then it'll slowly be revealed and and in Colossians Paul tells us what this mystery this hidden Mystery is it was something hidden from the the uh the Old Testament Believers the Saints in the Old Testament the that could not understand that God could Tabernacle himself in a people in a gentile people but then on the day of Pentecost this mystery began to be revealed and it's a mystery because it's called a mystery because it's not revealed all at once but it's slowly slowly revealed over time you know even in your own life you're born again and but you see the mystery but you don't see all the mystery it's slowly unveiled now if if it's a secret nobody knows what it is you don't even know there is anything but a mystery is is behind the curtain and the curtain slowly pulled back so that you slowly begin to see more and more and more as it's unveiled now that's what Paul's talking about the even the the hidden wisdom it's wisdom that you don't know by your carnal understanding you can't you can't know by being schooled I see see what Paul's getting at the only way you're going to know this wisdom is by the Holy Ghost you got to have the spirit within you how can the point he's trying to make is H how can you know what somebody you can't know what another man is thinking unless you got unless you really to really understand somebody else unless you can have their Same Spirit how can you know the mind of God but we have the mind of Christ because we've got the same Spirit the same spirit because we're United by the spirit we we can understand these things so you'll never be able to understand these things by carnal understanding but it's the wisdom of God that he gives to us because he we're born again so what what's the hidden wisdom God's Eternal Plan of Redemption through Jesus Christ and the hidden wisdom is a divine revelation that goes beyond human reasoning that can't be discerned or understo understood by the natural man that Paul's talking about it it it's you got to have the Holy Ghost to understand these deep things of God brother random would say he'd say God's will is a mystery and each man has to seek out the will of God for his or herself God's mystery now there's something to ponder is it that that you actually have to seek it out for yourself this mystery that's slowly unfolding how do we find out Paul it was known to him he said he said he didn't confer with any man no Flesh and Blood now ain't that what Paul's talking about in in the first chapter you you don't get your identity because you went to a certain church or you sat under certain teacher or you did certain things not that way your identity comes from a your own personal revelation of the word of God you and God Alone just you and God Alone amen he didn't confer with any man no Flesh and Blood he went to no school no Seminary he had nothing to do with it but it was revealed to him by Jesus Christ who met him on the road to Damascus in a light like a pillar of fire and it called him now this hidden wisdom the world don't know nothing about it that's why Paul said in verse 8 he'd say which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord Of Glory if they knew what the mystery was they wouldn't have rejected it same thing today the the world rejects it and makes their websites and calls it fake and so many things because they the carnal mind just can't understand it you got to have the Holy Ghost to understand it you got to have the Holy Ghost to even to even know anything about what we're talking about here but as it is written I hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him in other words you can't understand there's no way to understand these things just by your own understanding but but here he says in verse 10 but God had revealed them unto us the things that seem so far away that you just can't you you there how can I understand but you can understand by the Holy Ghost for the spirit searcheth all things yay the Deep things of God so in verse 13 He says which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teaches I've got this little seesaw of the it's The Head and the Heart not man's Wisdom which is the head but which the Holy Ghost teacheth the heart now there's there's the difference between education that intellectual understanding where you can talk about things versus the heart which is the Revelation it's putting everything together so the picture unfolds and it's like uh you know how brother brother Dale used used to use that example of of if all the nuts and bolts fall out on the floor Revelation comparing it to that would be able to put things and say well this goes in this part of the car this goes here this goes here because Revelation can put things together can put the picture together just like how if you can see the picture you can see your growth you can see that we've got to come from a little baby form to maturity and you begin to see the picture unfold what what is that picture it's the mystery the hidden Mystery that Paul's talking about the mystery of his will so which the Holy Ghost teach us comparing spiritual things with spiritual what's that mean comparing spiritual things with spiritual so so that means spiritual truths have to be understood taught and evaluated in the context of spiritual Revelation not not not human reason or worldly viewpoints and and when you're looking when you're trying to understand things you use script scripture actually interpret scripture so you think you you think well I got you come up with your own idea but it's got to compare with scripture you take it back to scripture and so you're actually understanding something spiritual by something spiritual it's the Holy Ghost in you this is spiritual that that was that was birthed In You by the word and you're you're comparing that with the word and the word is actually interpreting the word so it's you're understanding the spiritual things with spiritual and and and then that's how you can understand things of life because if you're not led by the Holy Ghost spiritual truths are just foolish but because you've got the Holy Ghost now you can compare things correctly you can discern things correctly because the Holy Ghost gives you understanding the holy in other words the Holy Ghost enables Believers to measure to measure up things is is this right is it wrong what is that preacher preaching right is he preaching wrong and you're comp comparing spiritual things with spiritual and and then also you you look at it in different phases of your life you're going to look at things different when when you're a baby you won't you you're going to I mean we we even compare um we talk about how even when you're preaching sermons you preach that same sermon maybe a year later and it you're looking at things different and it will you'll be able to express things maybe in a higher form because of growth because things soon as you step down from the pulpit or as soon as you leave this church you'll today you'll be different than the way that you were when you entered and you're you're constantly growing and and that makes you look at things different than the way that you used to look at it so there's different aspects of your spiritual experience that are unveiling deeper truths over time comparing spiritual to spiritual but the natural manth I've got I've got the listening post here that you can see the natural math doesn't know how to hear the the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discern we were talking in the car riding over here that uh the natural man just looks at the things of the message and all they have to see are things to poke at and make fun of and everything but a spiritual man looks at it and and it's like this this like the duck the duck craving water this is the thing that I've been wanting all my life this is this is it I found it but to the Natural man all he sees is something to to make fun of and poke at but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man now what's Paul trying to say here don't don't you love how every scripture that Paul says is just so packed full of meaning that you can just sit there and just digest it and and and ruminate on it and think about he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself does Judge of no man now Paul's trying to say here that there's two there's basically two types of people that's what he's saying in in this in this chapter the natural man those who rely just on their human wisdom and they can't understand the deeper things of God and the spiritual man that's been born again of God and and now he's Guided by this wisdom and is able to tap in to this mystery and the picture is unfolding he's got the listening post and he's able to hear not just with his natural mind but he's able to hear God speaking when the preacher is preaching over the pulpit and he's listening and he's understanding cuz he got something on the inside that can pick up the receiver from that seventh Dimension so he's saying the explanation of this scripture is there's a a spiritual ual person can weigh and discern can can can judge things because he's got the Holy Ghost but the natural man can't can't fully understand or critique it's like somebody looking at your life and they just can't quite understand why you act the way that you do and why that you do the things that they do but you on the other end that a born again Christian are able your position by the new birth to be able to rightly evaluate and judge situations and be able to tell right from wrong while somebody looking at you just looks at you as as though you're just a peculiar person an oddball strange but you are positioned to look at things the right way like in John chapter 8 Jesus said ye judge after the flesh carnally he said I judge no man but yet if I judge my judgment is true for I am not alone but I and the father that sent me so in other words he's saying you're looking at things from a carnal standpoint but if I were to judge I would be able to judge rightly because I'm able to look at things from that Supernatural standpoint now now look at what Paul said saying out here and he says for who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him now I got a picture of just two two people arguing having a little discussion and and and and it just maybe illustrates the point that how is somebody how can you know what the other person's can you how you know sometimes we struggle even in like a marriage couples to really understand the husband really understand the wife the the wife to really understand the husband how how can you really understand one another even in a church situation to really understand the other person how and how can you really understand God if you just have a carnal understand you're not you're never going to be able to understand God in the same way that we can't really understand one another because there's there's a a gap between us but but then you take that Spirit if you've got the same Spirit then you can understand so that's why Paul says he says he goes on to say but we've got the mind of Christ you take somebody that's that's been born again by the word and they they they look at things totally different now because now they're they they they can understand because the spirit of God is in them so in other words no human being through their intellect alone can fully grasp God's thoughts or ways because God's wisdom is beyond human capacity to reason or teaching brother BR would say I don't care how intellectual you are we still got Canary brains because we're only human beings God is know by the spirit and by the Revelation by the Holy Ghost will never be able to understand him through intellectuals you might talk and have intellectual meetings and psychology as much as you want to and people will never know God they can't you can explain and say the people that cry and turn the turn the other cheek or just the oldfashioned but that's the man that's reflecting Christ in his life a man who is humble a man who will walk with God will act like Jesus amen now we're we're going to what Paul's closing thought is if you take on the mind of Christ you take on the character of Christ you start thinking the word is transforming your you're thinking the way it's transforming you and you're slowly being transformed to be like Jesus and this is what how brother brandom explains this scripture and the message identification he said we've got to take the entire Full Gospel we must and now being that we have identified ourselves as Full Gospel people let's mold our character we're invited to be molded in His image that we might reflect his presence and the works that I do shall you do also the life that I live so shall you we're invited by God to take him as an example and let our character be molded like his that then when we let his character be in us then we have become Sons by having the mind of Christ Christ mind which is his character your mind makes your character let the Mind Paul said of Christ this mind that was in Christ be in you let that mind of Christ be in you it molds the character of a Son of God you can meditate on that all day long your mind makes your character like in Proverbs he said eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye somebody that's just out to get it somebody else jealousy enemity don't don't eat bread with that person neither desire thou his dainy Meats why cuz as he thinketh in his heart the way he thinks about things if he's thinking jealous thoughts in his mind he's going to act it out in his character is he's thinking if he's thinking good thoughts and thinking thinking thoughts that are aligned with God's word then he'll that will produce in his character as you think in your heart now that's something good too not your head but your heart as you think in your heart that's how you are eat and drink saith he to thee but his heart is not with thee now now you can even you can even see that just in the natural just just looking out in the world the way that somebody thinks about things that's how their character is actually expressed you look at some situations like there here's some some situations I just wrote down Bernie Bernie maid off that uh you know he he he was so greedy in his thoughts that he invented that big Ponzi scheme that if you you can go research it on your own time everybody thought that his investment scheme was making all this money but he was actually had a Ponzi scheme where the new investors were actually paying the old investors and they were wondering how is his investment company making $17 billion a year but he was faking it all why cuz his thought his thought was it don't matter I'll just be greedy and nasty and dishonest and it expressed itself in his character now the same way as the word of God grabs a hold of a believer's life it begins to change your thinking to where you start thinking that all things are possible and the example brother R gave to thinking thinking right is like Martha at the tomb that she could have scolded and she could have jumped on Jesus where were you and all this kind of thing but instead she said even now even now whatever you say because her thinking was right and expressed in her character look at Adolf Hitler that was his thinking was wrong he wanted to uh he he he was just filled with hatred and and wanted to be you know Superior and and he had all these distorted beliefs and a quest for power and those thoughts actually expressed in his character or Elizabeth Holmes is another good example where she had everybody convinced that she made this little machine called The Edison machine that was supposed to be able to just with a drop of blood tell you all that was wrong with your blood and she deceived everybody and built a whole company on that until they found out that everything she said was was wrong that she was just a liar and a deceiver what was it was the thoughts so the thoughts will actually manifest in your character in the same way now that that's a powerful thought now that brother Brandon would say that if you as the word is is actually piled up in your heart you begin to believe that all things are possible even to where it actually changes the way that you speak that you believe that God can heal you of cancer and and not because you're trying to act like it or you're trying to prove anything but it's the word of God that piles up within your heart until your thinking changes right and you begin to believe amen that what God Said is true yes and that's why he said in the form and latter rain he said the church and all of its spiritual gifts and lights and so forth and the great signs that he's given to the church to look at there's the world out there the Fig Tree putting forth its buds all these other things are handwriting on the wall to the world but you see these signs appearing The Works that I do shall you also that's the character being expressed a little while and the world seeth me no more ye shall see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world these signs appearing what is it the spirit in the church is becoming so close like Jesus till the church and the spirit will unite together and the resurrection will come what what is that how does a Rapture happen it's your thinking the word pile word upon word precept upon precept that's right until your thinking changes and as your thinking changes your character changes so that you're so close to Jesus until you can't tell the difference that's right it's God and Christ are manifested fully in the bride in Oneness God bless you the musicians can go ahead and come and we'll stop right for [Music]
