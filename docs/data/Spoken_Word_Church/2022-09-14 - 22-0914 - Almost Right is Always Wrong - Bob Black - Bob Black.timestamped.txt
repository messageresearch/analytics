[10:27] almost right is always wrong
[10:29] and we'll read from genesis chapter
[10:31] three
[10:32] um verses one to eight lord god was so
[10:35] grateful to be able to gather together
[10:37] around your word tonight lord jesus and
[10:38] as we look into your word and and unpack
[10:41] these things lord that are laying there

[11:09] something tonight that we can profit
[11:10] thereby from lord and we we just ask
[11:13] this blessing upon your people and upon
[11:14] your word in the name of the lord jesus
[11:18] so it says
[11:19] now
[11:21] you know as we read this you just think
[11:23] about what a blessing it is to be able
[11:24] to read this and to understand it what a
[11:27] blessing it is and
[11:28] um i've heard uh many ministers lately
[11:32] preaching about how that you know you
[11:34] think about brother branham would preach
[11:36] so many sermons and the people he was
[11:38] preaching to was against him i i as
[11:40] actually i was studying this out i i i i
[11:43] i you just you just pay attention to
[11:46] the things that brother branham says as
[11:48] he's preaching serpent seed and all
[11:50] these
[11:51] many many other sermons as he's speaking
[11:53] to pentecostal people and whatnot they
[11:55] they don't they didn't agree with him
[11:58] when you think about what a blessing it
[11:59] is
[12:00] that we have to the blessing what a
[12:03] blessing it is that i have to be able to
[12:05] speak to people that agree
[12:07] you think so so maybe maybe tonight if
[12:09] you could just just uh just respond as
[12:12] though you would if brother branham was
[12:14] preaching to you
[12:16] rick
[12:18] amen like you believe it
[12:22] so verse 1 says now the serpent was more
[12:25] subtle than any beast of the field which
[12:27] the lord god had made and he said unto
[12:28] the woman yea if god said you shall not
[12:31] eat of every tree of the garden and the
[12:34] woman said unto the serpent we may eat
[12:36] of the fruit of the trees of the garden
[12:37] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[12:39] the midst of this gar of the garden god
[12:40] hath said you shall not eat of it
[12:43] neither shall ye touch it lest you die
[12:46] and the serpent said unto the woman ye
[12:48] shall not surely die
[12:50] for god doth know that in the day ye eat
[12:52] thereof then your eyes shall be opened
[12:55] and ye shall be as gods knowing good and
[12:57] evil and when the woman saw that the
[13:00] tree was good for food and that it was
[13:02] pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be
[13:03] desired to make one wise she took of the
[13:06] fruit thereof
[13:07] and that eat and gave also under her
[13:09] husband with her and he did eat
[13:11] and the eyes of them both were opened
[13:14] and they knew that they were naked and
[13:15] they sewed fig leaves together and made
[13:17] themselves aprons you may be seated the
[13:20] lord had his blessing to the reading of
[13:21] the word
[13:23] in in this strain you know you really
[13:25] don't hear this preached on that much
[13:27] but i want to take from this scripture
[13:29] that that thought that i shared with you
[13:31] earlier almost right is always wrong
[13:33] you know i think i think i think one one
[13:35] kind of thing that's kind of crept in
[13:37] among amongst message churches and
[13:38] message believers is that is that we
[13:40] kind of get a little bit we kind of
[13:42] overlook wrong and and we start just
[13:45] kind of opening up ourselves to all
[13:47] sorts of ideas and all sorts of thoughts
[13:49] but you know you gotta and maybe tonight
[13:51] just remind us that that almost right
[13:53] almost right when you where you get to
[13:55] get up to the line and you're almost
[13:57] there but yeah it's it's always wrong
[14:00] and you see eve eve here she started
[14:01] listening to
[14:03] just one word off that the serpent was
[14:05] throwing at her that well just one word
[14:07] off
[14:08] caused everything that we see around us
[14:10] every sickness every heartache
[14:12] everything that you endured
[14:14] having to go to a job having to go to
[14:16] the hospital what go having to go to
[14:18] funerals everything that we we all this
[14:20] pollution that we see around us is what
[14:22] was caused by
[14:24] by her thinking that she was right
[14:27] going off and thinking that she was
[14:28] right almost right is always wrong
[14:31] you think about how that um
[14:33] you think about now god god coming down
[14:35] in the cooler lead and i'm just going to
[14:36] try to just talk tonight
[14:38] that god coming down in the cool of the
[14:40] evening and brother brahma in one place
[14:42] he would say you know thunderings and
[14:44] lightnings and lights and
[14:46] like it was like a
[14:47] uh oh god's coming down he's coming down
[14:50] and he'd come down and then you see the
[14:53] light coming from the bushes or whatever
[14:54] and the way that he would explain it and
[14:56] you think what kind of a process would
[14:58] have had to take for eve to go out and
[15:01] say well instead of listening to this
[15:03] instead of listening to his word
[15:06] i'm going to listen to this to the to
[15:08] this beast to the serpent who you know
[15:10] the serpent was was turned into a
[15:12] serpent but he at first he was walking
[15:14] around on two two legs and and he could
[15:16] talk to her because he had a
[15:18] conversation that we just read and what
[15:20] kind of a process would it take for to
[15:22] some to get somebody into the state of
[15:23] mind where they go listen to the man
[15:25] that was tilling and planting flowers
[15:27] out in your in your in front of your
[15:29] house or whatever and kind of you're
[15:30] doing your yard work or whatever it
[15:32] might be the the doing the manual labor
[15:34] to go from listening to the man that
[15:37] took from a god that would come down in
[15:39] the cooler eden to evening to listening
[15:41] to the one that's supposed to be obeying
[15:42] you
[15:43] and you see
[15:44] now see god had put them
[15:46] why why is it why is it a woman now you
[15:49] a woman a woman has she's got a wound in
[15:51] her and she's got the ability now even
[15:54] even carry this on to type and type in a
[15:56] church type in the bride the woman has
[15:59] got a womb that she can receive
[16:01] she can receive from this man or from
[16:03] this man she's got a womb and so the
[16:05] woman has that has the ability to
[16:07] receive so so god had put the put in
[16:09] front of her he's got he's put in front
[16:11] of her the choice he's handed down the
[16:13] requirements to adam and eve
[16:16] don't do this
[16:18] oh my how many how many of us have we've
[16:21] handed down the requirements to our kids
[16:23] and to our family you see your kids
[16:25] growing up and teenagers to teenagers
[16:27] and or maybe you maybe you've uh
[16:28] husbands have have handed down the
[16:30] requirements even to your wife and and
[16:32] things get messed up a little bit don't
[16:34] you can't wear clothes like that and
[16:37] when you see when the when the when the
[16:39] wife starts going off well i can do
[16:41] whatever i whatever i i you ain't
[16:44] telling me what to do
[16:45] then you get off off the track
[16:47] tell your kids that tell your kids that
[16:49] you can't you you don't need to be
[16:52] smoking pot you don't need to be smoking
[16:55] drinking alcohol because it's going to
[16:56] lead you down the road of destruction
[16:59] and as soon as you do you see it'll sin
[17:02] will lead you farther than you ever want
[17:04] to go before long you've wound up on the
[17:06] side of the road with a cop at your door
[17:08] and and taking you to the jailhouse or
[17:11] you wound up in some bar with your arms
[17:13] wrapped around a toilet and
[17:16] soaking in your own vomit and you you
[17:18] wind up in some kind of you wind up and
[17:20] come on let's be honest now tonight you
[17:22] wind up in a strange bear the next
[17:23] morning because sin will take you
[17:25] farther than you ever wanted to go all
[17:27] because you didn't you open you opened
[17:30] up your your womb your spiritual wound
[17:32] the womb of your mind to the wrong thing
[17:35] so god's telling god told eve and adam
[17:38] you can eat this
[17:40] but don't eat that because it'll kill
[17:42] you uh you you think about how many how
[17:45] many people today think that the the the
[17:47] message that the gospel is just a bunch
[17:49] of rules to hurt you but the rules
[17:52] there's rules there to keep to make you
[17:54] happy god has set rules in place to make
[17:56] you happy you know sometimes sometimes
[17:59] mama and daddy will set rules in place
[18:01] when they're when their little daughter
[18:02] is dating boys and things because they
[18:04] want they want to set boundaries for the
[18:06] happiness of their child so that one day
[18:09] she'll be able to enter in into a
[18:11] marriage union with a good man that will
[18:14] raise raise up a family and that she
[18:16] won't have to have some out of wedlock
[18:18] baby there or you know have a whole a
[18:21] whole mess of a background situation to
[18:23] deal with but you see all the rules and
[18:25] things are for happiness god has put
[18:28] these rules there for for for you to be
[18:30] happy for you to be for you to be set up
[18:32] so you can serve him
[18:34] now now you see she she ate she ate she
[18:38] ate she partook of the doctrine the the
[18:40] doc the false doctrine of the serpent
[18:43] was was was uh preaching to her you know
[18:46] in proverbs chapter 30 it says such is
[18:48] the way of an adulterous woman
[18:51] she eateth and wipeth her mouth and say
[18:53] if i have and saith i have done no
[18:55] wickedness uh the way of an adulterous
[18:57] woman now now we're gonna maybe use some
[18:59] strong words tonight so just get set up
[19:01] we're gonna use words like adultery and
[19:03] prostitution and because these
[19:05] words we we got to y'all
[19:08] we we got it we got to use these to get
[19:10] the point across so just maybe grab the
[19:12] edge of your seat tonight and hang on
[19:14] because we're going to be talking about
[19:16] some some pointed facts now adultery
[19:18] what we want to get in tonight is what
[19:20] what is an adulterous spirit
[19:23] is the devil wants to anoint god wants
[19:25] to anoint you and the devil wants to
[19:27] anoint you and the devil will anoint
[19:29] preachers the preachers with an
[19:30] adulterous spirit maybe they ain't even
[19:32] in adultery but he'll anoint them and
[19:34] what what is that the adulterous spirit
[19:37] is it don't matter
[19:39] it don't matter you're married to this
[19:41] man
[19:42] an adulterous woman you're married to
[19:44] this man but you think you start
[19:46] thinking because you're anointed of the
[19:48] devil you start thinking well it don't
[19:50] matter i can just go i can go fool
[19:51] around
[19:52] and you see the same thing when you're
[19:54] supposed to be married to christ
[19:57] when you're supposed to be married to
[19:58] christ and you're you're claiming his
[20:00] name and you go fooling around with all
[20:02] kind of false doctrines and saying that
[20:05] it doesn't matter that's the point i
[20:07] want to make tonight is it does matter
[20:10] see eve thought that it didn't matter
[20:11] when she went around talking to the
[20:13] devil and well you know maybe you maybe
[20:15] this the serpent does have a better idea
[20:18] of it and she began to think that it
[20:20] just didn't matter she was going to go
[20:21] along with it such as the way of an
[20:24] adulterous woman it does matter it does
[20:26] matter if the doctor tells you not to
[20:28] eat all that fatty food and you go eat
[20:30] it anyway it matters and it matters if
[20:32] god told you not to eat something that's
[20:35] wrong and you go out and you do it
[20:36] anyway
[20:37] it matters
[20:39] why is it women though in revelation 17
[20:42] we find a woman
[20:43] and and it says and there came one of
[20:45] the seven angels which had the seven
[20:47] vials and talked with me saying unto me
[20:49] come hither i will show unto thee the
[20:50] judgment of the great
[20:52] that sitteth upon many waters
[20:55] the great
[20:57] with whom the kings of the earth had
[20:58] committed fornication
[21:00] and the inhabitants of the earth have
[21:01] been made drunk
[21:03] with the wine of her fornication
[21:07] so he carried me away in the spill
[21:09] spirit into the wilderness and i saw a
[21:11] woman sit upon a scarlet colored beast
[21:14] full of names of blasphemy having seven
[21:17] heads and ten horns
[21:18] and the woman was arrayed in purple and
[21:21] scarlet color and decked with gold and
[21:23] precious stones having a golden cup in
[21:26] her hand full of abominations and
[21:27] filthiness of her fornication and upon
[21:30] her forehead was a name written mystery
[21:32] babylon the great the mother of
[21:34] heartless and abominations of the earth
[21:36] here's a here's a woman
[21:38] revelation is the book of symbols and
[21:40] all these things are symbolic of
[21:42] something so here's here's a great
[21:44] the great that's the mother of
[21:45] heartless and and she's given all these
[21:48] nations to drink of the filthiness of
[21:50] the the couple for fornications and
[21:52] brother brown would go on to explain he
[21:53] said he said it said this woman was a
[21:56] that means that she was ill-famed
[21:58] woman that she's supposed to be married
[22:00] to a husband and committed fornications
[22:02] with the world
[22:04] and she had she was a mother of
[22:05] heartless therefore she had daughters i
[22:08] believe the lord has perfectly laid it
[22:10] on the line that can't be nothing else
[22:12] but the catholic church it's the only
[22:15] way it can be and what did she give
[22:17] birth to the protestant churches exactly
[22:19] she did you see you see this type that
[22:21] runs through it's a woman a woman has a
[22:24] womb and in that womb she can receive
[22:27] she can receive
[22:29] and we're talking doctrine here she can
[22:30] receive an idea and that idea that that
[22:34] thought is going to give birth to
[22:35] something now in this case this woman
[22:37] she received she received the devil's
[22:39] lie and she gave birth to all these
[22:42] protestant churches oh you start
[22:44] thinking about women now now let's get
[22:46] into practical practical talk now you
[22:49] think in your and your christian journey
[22:52] about all the times now i'm not i'm not
[22:54] being beaten on women or nothing
[22:56] but all the times that a little couple
[22:58] will come to church
[22:59] and the and the man will he'll be like i
[23:02] want to start getting tapes i want to
[23:03] start listening i want to hang around
[23:05] and the woman she'll go out of church
[23:07] and listen i'm i'm talking truth now
[23:10] i've seen this so many times the woman
[23:12] will say she'll stomp her feet and say i
[23:15] ain't never darkening the door of that
[23:16] place before again and away they go
[23:20] and they won't never come back because
[23:21] the man he won't be like adam now he
[23:23] won't have a backbone he won't stand up
[23:26] he won't be like a real man but he'll
[23:28] well i guess i guess i better do it you
[23:30] see oh god god wants real christian men
[23:34] that when your wife won't dress right
[23:35] and when your wife won't do right that
[23:37] you stand strong and say well i'm i'm
[23:39] standing for the word of god and you see
[23:41] you see that even the christian the
[23:43] church is a type of a woman i i so
[23:45] that's why i'm not i'm not blasting on
[23:47] women tonight like people thought
[23:49] brother branham did
[23:50] but but he's you know if you get a real
[23:52] uh uh the way a woman is supposed to be
[23:55] that it the way the bride god wants the
[23:58] bride to be is is a reflection of
[24:00] himself an actual reflection of himself
[24:03] but she the woman's got a choice she can
[24:05] be she can be lower than a dog or she
[24:08] can be she can be the express image of
[24:11] god actually manifesting himself in
[24:13] flesh in this day or she can degrade
[24:16] herself as you see it all depends on
[24:18] what she accepts because
[24:21] well now i'm getting on marriage and
[24:22] divorce
[24:26] that that was just opening up to me
[24:27] fresh that
[24:30] so brother brown would say what
[24:31] but you you think about that now you
[24:33] think about even
[24:35] going back to a woman you think you
[24:36] think about brother brown said the
[24:37] serpent seed came over in the ark now
[24:39] why how could it how could it do that
[24:41] now
[24:42] now this is i'm
[24:44] this is just my way of looking at it a
[24:46] woman's going to receive a woman the
[24:47] type of of a church is going to receive
[24:49] that doctrine and they carried false
[24:52] doctrine over that ark and they because
[24:54] look look that's how that's how it
[24:55] happens even even right maybe sitting
[24:57] here tonight you'll listen to the things
[24:59] that i'm saying and then the mother will
[25:01] go home and she'll start spreading and
[25:03] stuff well i don't think i think it's
[25:05] okay if you go out and kiss some girl or
[25:07] something i don't think there's nothing
[25:09] wrong with that i don't think there be
[25:11] anything wrong at all with the way that
[25:13] you're wearing that that's closed i
[25:14] don't think there's nothing wrong
[25:16] and go around the husband's back and and
[25:18] start saying all kind of stuff the man's
[25:21] standing we need to have a standard but
[25:23] around around his back goes to woman to
[25:26] sew that false doctrine to do the same
[25:30] thing that the serpent did to eve down
[25:32] in the garden
[25:33] and carrot carried it over the ark
[25:35] carried over the ark into the new world
[25:39] oh you think you think it it don't
[25:41] matter though it don't matter see god
[25:43] said it mattered so much
[25:46] that he equated it with adultery
[25:48] with whoredom with fornications and
[25:51] those are strong words
[25:53] brother i'm saying what is a
[25:55] there's a woman that's untrue to her
[25:57] marriage vow
[25:58] now the church the catholic church
[26:00] claims to be the bride and the wife of
[26:02] christ even the nuns cut off their hair
[26:05] they cut off their hair but to show that
[26:07] they ain't
[26:07] you you wear long hair why because of
[26:10] the angels because you're going to show
[26:12] as a symbol i i've heard the word of the
[26:14] lord i've heard what the ministers are
[26:16] preaching so i'm going to wear my long
[26:17] hair because as a symbol that when i go
[26:20] to walmart everybody's going to know i'm
[26:22] a christian but the nuns they cut off
[26:24] their hair to show that i they ain't
[26:26] listening to who their true husband is
[26:28] they're going to listen to the to the
[26:29] false idea that they that the devil has
[26:32] sown into their mind
[26:34] even the nuns cut off their hair and
[26:35] have no affections they're all
[26:37] affections to christ is that right sure
[26:39] or anybody see see what is a horse you
[26:42] can't tell me what's right a woman that
[26:44] won't stay true to her husband and go
[26:46] out and live with any old man that you
[26:49] think now that's natural but what about
[26:51] in the spiritual somebody that won't
[26:52] stand true to the to her spiritual
[26:55] husband but will go out there fooling
[26:57] around with the fooling around with
[26:58] false doctrines i can believe i can
[27:00] believe what i want to ain't no preacher
[27:02] gonna tell me i need to be born again
[27:05] ain't nobody gonna tell me i need to
[27:06] come to church ain't nobody gonna tell
[27:09] me how my family needs to be dressing
[27:11] and ain't nobody gonna tell me the
[27:12] spiritual condition of my family or my
[27:14] household i can do what i wanna do
[27:18] see what kind of spiritual condition you
[27:19] got a woman a is a woman that
[27:22] won't listen to her head that won't get
[27:24] under headship a woman's
[27:27] god wants a bride that'll be so under
[27:30] headship that he can manifest himself
[27:32] through her
[27:33] so so under headship that she's doing
[27:36] exactly what he wants her to do even if
[27:38] the world laughs at her and mocks her
[27:40] and scoffs at her
[27:44] brother said in the seal of god he said
[27:46] you can't argue with the priest he won't
[27:48] argue because a priest
[27:49] a catholic preached priest that woman he
[27:51] said if the church says anything
[27:53] different from this bible the church is
[27:55] right see how he's putting that
[27:56] spiritually the woman the woman the
[27:59] church and saying the church is right
[28:02] not the man but the church
[28:04] to me the bible is right and the church
[28:06] is wrong so you can't argue with him
[28:09] there's no way of arguing there's no way
[28:11] of discussing or debating because they
[28:14] believe what the church says that's it
[28:18] what i say what what the woman says
[28:20] that's it is what the point he's making
[28:23] what the church says no matter what the
[28:25] bible says that's what the church says
[28:28] they believe the church we believe the
[28:30] bible
[28:32] and there's a streak of romanism that's
[28:34] mixed in every nation there is under
[28:36] heaven through the catholic church a
[28:39] streak of romanism
[28:41] a streak of romanism to permeate every
[28:44] fabric of society today that i can do i
[28:46] can do what i want to do
[28:48] and not th not the word of god the word
[28:50] of god becomes no more our standard that
[28:52] we live by but i can do whatever i want
[28:55] to and that makes you see almost right
[28:58] is always wrong
[28:59] you can come to church and you can go
[29:01] through all the all the outward
[29:03] appearance and pay your tithes and
[29:05] everything and still be wrong because
[29:07] almost right it's always wrong
[29:10] that's what the bible's talking about
[29:12] that isaiah prophesied back in
[29:14] chapter four verse one he said in that
[29:16] day
[29:17] seven women shall take hold of one man
[29:20] saying we'll eat our own bread
[29:22] and we'll wear our own apparel
[29:25] only let us be called by thy name to
[29:27] take away our approach and you've had
[29:29] them seven women all down through seven
[29:31] church ages that that woman was was
[29:33] manifested in paul's age i'm gonna do
[29:35] what i want to do i'm gonna just do i'm
[29:37] gonna do i instead of taking the word of
[29:39] god i'm just going to take take my own
[29:41] ideas i'm going to take what the
[29:43] catholic church preaches i'm going to
[29:44] take what my denomination says we'll eat
[29:47] our own bread and we'll wear our own
[29:49] apparel nobody's going to tell me how to
[29:51] dress i don't care what the bible says
[29:53] only let us be called by thy name just
[29:55] let me as long as we can be called a
[29:57] christian as long as i can come to
[29:59] church and sit in a church and and say
[30:01] i'm a christian just so that'll take
[30:03] away our approach
[30:05] brother brown said your boy goes with a
[30:06] catholic girl when they go to get
[30:08] married they have to promise to raise
[30:09] the children vice versa see it's to
[30:12] break the power of the other
[30:14] to break the power but what is it the
[30:16] bible claims the whole thing's
[30:18] a prostitute amen
[30:22] he says spiritual adultery
[30:25] spiritual adultery that you profess to
[30:27] be a christian and still living like the
[30:30] world
[30:31] well there's your definition of
[30:33] spiritual adultery
[30:35] i am a christian when you say i'm a
[30:37] christian but you're still going out
[30:38] there living living like the world doing
[30:41] doing you've taken in that wrong
[30:43] doctrine
[30:44] taking the creeds of man out here as
[30:46] man's creeds and accepting them instead
[30:48] of the word that's committing a
[30:50] spiritual adultery against god
[30:52] and brother brown said for whosoever
[30:54] shall take one word away from it or add
[30:56] one word to it it took away from it
[30:57] you're dead hybrid right there she's
[31:00] back here there's testimony in her hands
[31:02] the filthiness of our fornications
[31:04] committing spiritual adultery against
[31:06] the very word that she claims to believe
[31:09] what are you saying tonight brother bob
[31:11] i'm saying it matters what you believe
[31:13] all these things matter what you believe
[31:15] it matters when you go to a minister's
[31:16] meeting and you hear things being said
[31:19] that ain't right it matters when you go
[31:21] out to other churches or have here's
[31:23] here's somebody maybe come to this
[31:24] church and preach something a little a
[31:26] little bit off it matters
[31:29] now listen see this is where you got to
[31:31] walk a tightrope it's like sometimes
[31:33] preaching it's like it's like walking
[31:34] out walking a walk in a
[31:36] real narrow spot because you go too far
[31:39] to one side and you start casting people
[31:41] out and saying i'm not going to
[31:42] fellowship with him and that's not what
[31:44] i'm preaching we're we're all like
[31:46] brother wade was saying on sunday we're
[31:47] trying to close in the gaps we're trying
[31:49] to fill in the gap
[31:51] and you know you preach sometimes you
[31:53] none of none of us believe what we did
[31:55] 20 years ago we've all got gaps that
[31:57] have been closed in so that's what we're
[31:59] trying to we're trying to close in the
[32:01] gaps but when you stop when you do when
[32:03] you stop and and and dollar like eve did
[32:06] and you receive the wrong thing
[32:09] and you hold that in it's going to
[32:11] produce something that's wrong that's
[32:13] what i'm talking about now brother i'm
[32:15] saying in the pergament church age he
[32:17] said i'll show thee the judgment of the
[32:18] great she was committing adultery
[32:21] well then if it was a church she was
[32:23] committing adultery against god
[32:26] then adultery would be fornications
[32:28] spiritual fornications she's teaching
[32:30] something to the people that's not god's
[32:32] word
[32:33] is that right she's teaching something
[32:35] that isn't true it matters it matters
[32:38] what you believe
[32:40] it matters what you believe i i love to
[32:42] sit down and talk to people about what
[32:43] they believe on it seems today though
[32:45] like it's hard to get people to tell you
[32:46] what they believe i i you know i sat
[32:49] down i sit down i love i love to get
[32:51] preachers alone and sit down with them
[32:52] over over lunch or whatever but it's
[32:54] like pulling teeth to get somebody to
[32:56] tell you what they believe and when you
[32:58] do when you do get them to tell you what
[33:00] they believe that just about almost it
[33:01] almost creates conflict like what are we
[33:03] doing here
[33:04] i i love to tell somebody what i believe
[33:07] that if you if you believe something
[33:09] you're gonna you're gonna be happy to
[33:11] share it i believe i believe we ought to
[33:12] know what we believe i don't i don't i
[33:15] don't believe we should be just like a a
[33:17] weed in the field that's tossed every
[33:19] way every which way but we should we
[33:21] should be firm in what we believe we
[33:22] should be able to stand on something and
[33:24] be ready to share it that doesn't the
[33:26] scripture say always be ready to give an
[33:28] answer
[33:30] so brother said in the spoken word is
[33:32] the original seed he said that's how
[33:33] adultery is committed spiritually when
[33:36] you know and better when you know him
[33:38] better by the word of god
[33:40] now listen to this now
[33:42] by the intercourse
[33:43] of the mind
[33:45] because that's where it all starts in
[33:47] in your mind first that's where it
[33:48] started in eve first before before she
[33:51] received it in her natural wound she
[33:53] received it in the womb of her mind
[33:56] by the intercourse of the mind take in a
[33:58] lie of the devil against the word of god
[34:00] that's exactly what he's done with a
[34:02] spiritual intercourse first that come by
[34:04] believing satan's lie into the womb of
[34:07] her mind
[34:08] that polluted her soul
[34:11] set death in the soul
[34:13] then the natural act taken place
[34:17] all you see now while the greatest
[34:18] battle ever fought is such an important
[34:20] message because god's trying to arm us
[34:22] in that message he talks about the five
[34:24] full ministry that god give us to put
[34:26] something in our hands so that we could
[34:27] have something to defend ourselves from
[34:29] all the lies of the devil because god
[34:31] wants us to be shored up now don't start
[34:33] going to sleep on me now come on now
[34:35] listen i believe that the bride should
[34:37] be entertained by the word that what am
[34:39] i talking about tonight that we
[34:41] god wants a bride that cares about the
[34:43] gospel enough that even when it's on
[34:45] wednesday night you you want to get fed
[34:47] you because you want to it starts
[34:49] mattering you realize it matters what
[34:51] you believe we're not coming just
[34:53] tonight to look at one another or to
[34:54] look at the preacher to be entertained
[34:56] by maybe some see how he see how much
[34:58] the preacher can jump around and maybe
[35:00] he'll jump run up and down the aisle but
[35:02] we're coming to be entertained by the
[35:04] word to receive something that will give
[35:06] us supernatural power and supernatural
[35:08] strength
[35:09] in second corinthians paul said would
[35:11] the god you could bear with me a little
[35:13] in my folly and indeed bear with me i
[35:16] wonder how much we can bear with the
[35:18] folly of the preachers that maybe
[35:19] sometimes slip up and say things a
[35:21] little bit coarse and say things a
[35:22] little bit rough do it like peter a
[35:24] little bit and some maybe maybe go
[35:26] fishing and stuff and
[35:28] and you know
[35:31] do things maybe that that we don't think
[35:33] are all polished up and nice but paul
[35:36] said for i am jealous over you with
[35:38] godly jealousy for i have espoused you
[35:40] to one husband that i may present you as
[35:43] a chaste virgin to christ don't you want
[35:45] a gospel five-fold ministry that'll have
[35:48] some love and care enough for you to
[35:50] preach the truth to you that won't hold
[35:52] back somebody that's jealous over you
[35:54] with a godly jealousy they don't want to
[35:56] see you carried off with every win the
[35:58] doctrine and foul thing that the devil
[36:00] throws at you paul said but i fear lest
[36:04] by any means there's a spirit beguiled
[36:06] eve through his subtlety so your mind
[36:09] should be corrupted from the simplicity
[36:11] that is in christ
[36:12] paul didn't want to see the church of
[36:14] that day led away by all kinds of tommy
[36:16] rod and i believe in this church we've
[36:18] got a 5-4 ministry that don't want to
[36:20] see you led away by about your timing
[36:22] rot and we've got it preached pure we've
[36:25] got it preached and done adulterated i
[36:27] want to pass out some roads to tonight i
[36:29] believe we've got a five full ministry
[36:31] to be proud of here in this church
[36:33] for if he that cometh preaches another
[36:35] jesus whom we have not preached or if
[36:37] you receive another spirit which you
[36:39] have not received or another gospel
[36:41] which ye have not accepted you might
[36:43] well bear with him i wonder how many
[36:46] preachers that preachers down through
[36:47] the ages have had that same concern i
[36:50] wonder if somebody comes and preaches
[36:52] something that's wrong are you just
[36:53] gonna fall hook line and sinker for it
[36:56] or maybe are you gonna get so caught up
[36:59] in how the gospel is delivered that you
[37:01] want a preacher that that
[37:04] a preacher that knows what fork to use
[37:06] at the dinner table whether the salad
[37:08] fork or whether this kind of fork a
[37:10] preacher that knows how long to turn to
[37:12] the right hand side of the table before
[37:14] he turns to the left to continue his
[37:16] discussion or do you want something you
[37:18] want to read that's tossed around about
[37:20] or do you want somebody that stands firm
[37:22] and knows what they believe
[37:26] listen it matters what is preached
[37:29] it matters what you believe
[37:31] the details matter don't don't you ever
[37:34] let the devil tell you it don't matter
[37:36] don't you ever let the devil tell you
[37:38] that it doesn't matter doctrine matters
[37:41] doctrine matters
[37:43] in matthew chapter 5 he said think not
[37:46] that i am come to destroy the law or the
[37:48] prophets i am not come to destroy but to
[37:50] fulfill for verily i say unto you till
[37:53] heaven and earth pass one jotter one
[37:55] tittle shall and no eyes pass from the
[37:58] law till all be fulfilled there ain't
[38:01] one little dot in this bible gonna pass
[38:03] away till the whole thing is fulfilled
[38:05] there's not one little comma gonna pass
[38:08] away in the bible until the whole thing
[38:10] is fulfilled everything has got to be
[38:13] believed because everything is going to
[38:16] be fulfilled and eve polluted when she
[38:19] received the devil's lie she polluted
[38:21] the entire human race
[38:24] oh you think
[38:26] you think about what true doctrine is
[38:28] this doctrine now that's going around
[38:29] the message that well we you you already
[38:32] had eternal life in your soul when you
[38:35] were born the natural birth but this is
[38:37] contrary to that doctrine you eve
[38:40] polluted the whole thing her soul her
[38:43] her her womb where brother said that
[38:45] polluted her soul set death in the soul
[38:47] then the natural act taken place it
[38:49] polluted her womb it polluted everything
[38:51] it polluted what did it polluted her
[38:53] thinking from then on the human race was
[38:57] not capable of thinking the right way
[39:00] that was not possible for god to inhabit
[39:02] the soul of the human being until god
[39:05] himself came down in flesh and made an
[39:07] atonement oh
[39:09] you go out and look on the internet and
[39:11] look for
[39:12] for pictures of what pollution looks
[39:14] like there's rivers in india that they
[39:16] dump trash in and this the trash is
[39:18] rolling by and there's the filth of
[39:21] humanity is rolling down the river until
[39:23] they can't even get clean drinking water
[39:25] out of it you gotta look at the smoke
[39:27] stacks and we've got an office in
[39:29] shanghai at work and shanghai is so
[39:31] polluted that they can't even see the
[39:33] sun during the day it's so polluted that
[39:36] they don't it's just a haze over the sky
[39:38] and that's the pollution that eve called
[39:41] when she accepted the lie of the devil
[39:43] the pollution of all these smokestacks
[39:46] and filled with the world the pollution
[39:47] and the water the pollution everywhere
[39:50] our birth was polluted you didn't come
[39:52] this world the right way but you come
[39:54] polluted our world was polluted i think
[39:57] it was polluted all because of a woman
[40:01] who thought she was right
[40:04] oh you think it don't matter what you
[40:06] believe you think it don't matter what
[40:08] kind of what you what you consume when
[40:10] you go out to listen to some other
[40:12] church
[40:13] you think about what
[40:15] everywhere you go was a symbol and a
[40:17] sign of what the consequences of
[40:19] somebody disagree and disbelieving with
[40:22] god's word
[40:25] and brother brown would say show me one
[40:27] place in the bible
[40:28] after what eve did
[40:30] show me one place in the bible that
[40:32] ought god ever ordained any woman to
[40:34] preach or take authority over a man
[40:39] it matters
[40:41] show me one place where god ever
[40:43] ordained the denomination
[40:45] show me one place where god ever
[40:47] ordained a woman preacher
[40:49] show me one place where god ever
[40:50] ordained sprinkling
[40:52] show me one place where god ever
[40:54] ordained pouring

[40:58] these things that brother brown said

[41:05] father son the holy ghost

[41:17] doesn't
[41:18] show me one place that he failed to
[41:20] prove that he wasn't god
[41:22] show me one scripture where peter ever
[41:24] was in rome or any history that says he
[41:26] was show me one scripture where to ever
[41:28] say it a apple started the thing to go
[41:31] on now
[41:32] i want you to show me that they eat
[41:35] apples it matters it matters what you
[41:37] believe
[41:39] it matters what you receive why does it
[41:41] matter because you you ha you got a womb
[41:43] as a spiritual the spiritual church
[41:45] you've got a womb and as you receive
[41:48] whatever you receive you're going to
[41:50] produce a baby eve received that lie of
[41:53] the devil and before long she was
[41:54] holding that baby
[41:56] you know a few few chapters later there
[41:58] she is with her confession i i've gotten
[42:01] a man from the lord and it was a man
[42:03] from the lord because all life comes
[42:04] from god but now i believe that she was
[42:07] she was the way the spirit that she was
[42:09] saying is look at me
[42:11] look at me it turned out all right after
[42:13] all
[42:14] and people dying all around her the
[42:17] rivers began to get polluted and there
[42:19] she was confessing that she was still
[42:21] right
[42:23] just like the churches today just like
[42:24] people around the message you can preach
[42:26] and pray this is this is a preacher's
[42:28] dilemma you can preach and preach and
[42:30] preach your heart out but they're still
[42:32] going to be unbelievers and make
[42:33] believers and true believers no matter
[42:35] how hard you preach
[42:37] there's going to be there's going to be
[42:38] unbelievers until the day that the
[42:40] rapture takes place and that's something
[42:42] i know that it grieves every true
[42:45] minister of god because you want to go
[42:47] out and grab somebody by the lapel and
[42:49] bring them to the altar and force them
[42:51] to praise pray through
[42:52] but it just don't work like that
[42:56] oh i wish don't you don't you just wish
[42:58] you could do your family like that
[43:04] you say we got new light on it no you
[43:06] haven't
[43:07] that's what the devil come to eve with
[43:09] some new life
[43:10] don't need new no new light you need to
[43:12] walk in the light that god's already put
[43:14] here that's all that's that's what we
[43:16] need that's what brother i'm saying in
[43:17] that message the serpent seed he's
[43:19] saying we don't need our own carnal
[43:20] understanding or what some false
[43:22] preachers preach to us but what will
[43:25] give us overcoming power is revelation
[43:28] revelation light
[43:30] would jesus come and ask peter whom do
[43:32] men say that i the son of a son of man
[43:34] am who do you say that i am and peter
[43:36] answer back thou art the christ thou
[43:39] either all tie that back to when abel
[43:41] come out of the garden he knew there was
[43:42] a way back and god revealed it to him
[43:45] that it was blood that it cut the fall
[43:47] come by blood there had to be blood to
[43:49] cover the whole thing over and he come
[43:51] dragging that animal up to sacrifice it
[43:54] because god had revealed it to him and
[43:56] when god reveals to you that you're
[43:58] saved or god reveals to you that he's
[44:00] filled you with the holy ghost that that
[44:02] takes care of everything
[44:05] there on the
[44:07] there on the day of pentecost peter come
[44:09] out and he wasn't speaking by man's
[44:11] understanding or some carnal
[44:12] intellectual idea but he said when they
[44:14] asked him men and brother and what
[44:16] should we do and he tied it all together
[44:18] because god had jesus had given him the
[44:20] keys and he said repent every one of you
[44:23] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[44:25] christ for the mission of sins and you
[44:27] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[44:29] he had the key what's the keys the keys
[44:31] is the revelation of jesus christ and
[44:34] the revelation of jesus christ to you
[44:36] will open up every door every obstacle
[44:38] it'll clear the way it'll overcome
[44:40] everything that the devil can throw at
[44:42] you
[44:43] in matthew chapter 16 he said i'll give
[44:45] unto thee the keys of the kingdom of
[44:46] heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on
[44:49] earth shall be bound in heaven and
[44:50] whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[44:52] shall be loosed in heaven do you believe
[44:54] that tonight that the the bride of jesus
[44:56] christ has those same keys that the if
[44:59] that breath the revelation of jesus
[45:01] christ is preached it will loose you
[45:03] from your sins it will loose you from
[45:04] what the devil's got bound but if you
[45:06] turn it down it'll bind you it'll leave
[45:08] you bound and leave you in that same
[45:10] situation because you have a womb
[45:13] you've got a womb to be able to receive
[45:15] or reject
[45:16] the revelation of jesus christ will open
[45:18] heaven the revelation of jesus christ
[45:21] will set you free
[45:22] jesus christ is the truth
[45:25] don't we all want truth
[45:28] how many times have we preached what a
[45:30] great blessing to somebody for somebody
[45:32] to stare you in the face and tell you
[45:33] the truth
[45:34] what a great blessing
[45:37] for somebody it was a blessing when
[45:38] jesus told that little woman he said
[45:40] it's not given to dogs
[45:42] what's her reaction going to be
[45:44] many times he wants to test your
[45:45] reaction to see
[45:47] how bad do you want it
[45:49] when when when jesus come out and was
[45:51] preaching do you a bunch of vipers well
[45:54] you saw what their reaction was
[45:56] you snakes in the grass when john the
[45:58] baptist said to is laid to the root of
[45:59] the tree
[46:01] many times the gospel is preached a
[46:03] little bit hard but god wants to see
[46:05] god wants to see what your reaction is
[46:08] how bad do you want it
[46:11] how bad do you want to brother adam said
[46:14] i can show you where jesus christ give
[46:16] power to the church to heal the sick and
[46:18] raise the dead and cast out devils i
[46:20] challenge any man to show me a scripture
[46:22] in the bible where he took it away from
[46:23] the church what took it away
[46:25] what took what what took it away you say
[46:27] well i don't see a lot of things going
[46:29] on in church i don't see anything going
[46:30] on in my life why not
[46:33] what took it away he said your own dogma
[46:36] right not god's word
[46:38] the holy spirit still getting the job
[46:40] done going right on just the same and he
[46:43] will forever and i i want to maybe maybe
[46:46] challenge you tonight if you don't see
[46:47] the power of god moving in your own life
[46:50] then maybe tonight when you get home in
[46:52] the still of the night get along with
[46:54] god in your in your little prayer closet
[46:56] and and ask him ask him like elisha did
[46:59] there at that river when he slapped that
[47:01] water with it with elijah's coat and he
[47:03] said where is the god of elijah i know
[47:05] god's got to be on the scene somewhere
[47:07] if other people are receiving the holy
[47:08] ghost if other people can receive that
[47:10] same quickening power then where is it i
[47:13] want some of it and god will come on the
[47:15] scene if you get rid of all your old
[47:16] dogma and start start aligning your your
[47:19] thinking and aligning your thoughts with
[47:21] the word of god and start thinking what
[47:22] god already said
[47:24] something will begin to take place
[47:27] brother said in the serpent seed he said
[47:29] along come the oneness and found out the
[47:30] baptism in jesus name they said oh we
[47:33] got it they organized what they do god
[47:34] just moved right out and left him
[47:36] sitting there it's for whosoever will
[47:38] let him come the oneness can't go to the
[47:40] assemblies and the assemblies can't go
[47:42] to the oneness
[47:45] he said i said how can you teach that
[47:46] initial initial evidence as a scholar
[47:48] and they said well said brother branham
[47:50] one two or three of them was real honest
[47:52] we know that's wrong but what can we do
[47:55] if we say anything about it
[47:58] why
[47:59] it'll interrupt the whole program
[48:02] and there's when you sold out
[48:04] for money
[48:05] and he said brother i'd rather have me a
[48:07] little mission on the corner or preach
[48:08] under a pine tree and have the truth
[48:11] certainly i know that you're telling the
[48:12] truth man wants the truth and you're
[48:15] obligated as a christian to bear forth
[48:18] the record of truth did you know that
[48:20] that you're obligated as a christian to
[48:22] bear forth a record of truth
[48:24] god's going to hold you responsible for
[48:27] it
[48:28] god's going to hold you responsible for
[48:30] it we were we were sitting around i'm
[48:32] going to name name some names here in a
[48:33] second as i tell this story
[48:35] i was sitting around the other night we
[48:37] were somebody was telling us about a
[48:39] brother that used to go to brother tim
[48:40] humes's church
[48:42] and he'd go up and he'd say he'd say i i
[48:44] know something's wrong in my life but i
[48:47] i want the baptism to hold i want to be
[48:49] born again and he never could get an
[48:50] answer now now let's be honest though
[48:53] you know we say we aren't supposed to
[48:54] name names and everything but come on
[48:56] now you got to be born again to be able
[48:59] to give somebody to be able to tell
[49:01] somebody how to be born again
[49:03] now how how many of you maybe maybe
[49:05] tonight you you want to be born again
[49:07] this this is the place to come to be
[49:09] born again because we've got the recipe
[49:11] and i i speak i speak boldly maybe maybe
[49:13] i speak like paul tonight we we know we
[49:16] know how to be born again if you want to
[49:17] be born again you come up to the altar
[49:19] and and we'll pray through with you
[49:21] we'll instruct you on how to do it
[49:23] because call why we we we got the truth
[49:25] i believe we've got the truth we've got
[49:27] a group of people here who know the
[49:29] truth we got a group of people here who
[49:31] want the truth so when you come to
[49:33] church here and you hear the truth
[49:34] preached you see
[49:36] god wants to see your reaction to the
[49:38] truth how much do you want it
[49:42] when that man in the bible that jesus
[49:43] talked about found that pearl of great
[49:45] price what did he do he sold everything
[49:48] to get that pearl of great price and the
[49:50] pearl is equated with wisdom there's a
[49:52] lot of pearls that people can tell you
[49:54] how to be how to be financially
[49:55] successful how to be a good person all
[49:57] this kind of stuff but this pearl is how
[49:59] to have eternal life and it's worth
[50:02] everything it's worth your pride it's
[50:04] worth your ego it's worth laying down
[50:07] all of your self-will it's worth laying
[50:10] selling everything that you got to get
[50:12] this pearl a great price it's worth it's
[50:15] worth coming to church for it's worth
[50:17] getting preached on for it's worth
[50:19] grabbing the pew while you're getting
[50:21] preached on and say it on me until
[50:23] something begins to break loose it's
[50:25] enough if it's enough to get spat on
[50:28] like david going up that mountain it's
[50:30] enough to get spat on like jesus and
[50:32] struck on the side of the head it's
[50:33] worth enough to be humiliated for you
[50:36] see people come around the gospel and
[50:38] they don't they don't want to pay the
[50:39] price
[50:40] they don't want to be humiliated enough
[50:42] they don't want to be they don't want to
[50:44] give nothing for it you don't get this
[50:46] oh you get it for free but you still got
[50:48] to give yourself you got to give
[50:50] yourself wheel you got to give you pride
[50:52] you gotta lay it all down the altar
[50:55] cause it's worth it all this it's worth
[50:58] somebody saying something rude to your
[51:00] church it's worth somebody saying
[51:02] something that they polished up
[51:04] oh
[51:06] oh the brotherhood said
[51:08] listen
[51:09] the truth is
[51:10] the truth is you were born polluted and
[51:13] you need the holy ghost
[51:15] you need the holy you need the holy
[51:17] ghost to be able to withstand when
[51:19] somebody says something rude to you you
[51:21] need the holy ghost saying if you don't
[51:23] have the holy ghost the truth of the
[51:25] matter is the truth is you're going to
[51:27] hell without it
[51:29] have we stopped
[51:31] has the message ring stop preaching
[51:33] about sin and about going to hell
[51:35] we don't you know we say we don't want
[51:37] to do like a baptist and dangle you over
[51:38] hell but the truth of the matter is if
[51:40] you're not saved you're going to hell
[51:43] there is a hell and we don't believe in
[51:46] eternal suffering because there's only
[51:48] one form of eternal life and if you
[51:50] don't have god's eternal life then
[51:51] you're going one day your soul will die
[51:54] it'll peter out
[51:56] he said the only way you know you got it
[51:58] was when your spirit bears record with
[52:00] his spirit and the fruits of the spirit
[52:02] follow you love faith joy peace long
[52:04] suffering goodness meekness
[52:06] gentleness
[52:07] that's when you know you got the holy
[52:09] ghost
[52:10] it bears record of itself
[52:13] the truth
[52:15] the truth is
[52:16] that if you don't enjoy hearing the word
[52:18] you're not born again
[52:20] if you don't enjoy
[52:21] coming to church you're not born again
[52:24] if you don't enjoy
[52:27] if you don't enjoy looking at the bible
[52:30] and reading it that you're not born
[52:32] again
[52:33] if you're if you're living in the world
[52:35] the love of the father is not even in
[52:36] you if you're living in the world then
[52:38] you're not born again come on now let's
[52:41] lay it out on the table you're not
[52:42] boring it and you need to be
[52:44] let's scream it like noah did if they
[52:46] are the day before the rain first failed
[52:49] because the ox surely the ark is closing
[52:52] surely you can see that we're at the
[52:53] closing time so come on into the ark
[52:56] come on in before it's too late you need
[52:58] to be born again you need to be saved
[53:00] don't get offended don't get your
[53:02] feelings hurt but because i'm preaching
[53:04] eternal life to you i'm preaching
[53:06] something that'll save your soul that's
[53:08] worth more than all your hurt feelings
[53:10] and moral all the stuff you want to
[53:12] cabbage down with if you'd rather be
[53:14] watching a movie than worshiping god
[53:16] you're not born again if you'd rather be
[53:19] at the pool hall than reading your bible
[53:21] you're not born again if you'd rather be
[53:23] clowning around with the world than
[53:25] going through a prayer line or
[53:26] worshiping with his saints you're not
[53:28] born again
[53:31] the bible says
[53:33] that the angel
[53:35] went through the midst of the city and
[53:36] set a mark upon the foreheads of the men
[53:38] that sighed and that cried for all the
[53:41] abominations that should be done that be
[53:43] done in the midst thereof and brother
[53:44] bran would ask that question how many if
[53:46] you ask all these pentecostal preachers
[53:48] how many people in your church are
[53:50] signing crying how many people
[53:53] care
[53:54] how many people care about what's
[53:57] preached
[53:58] i remember back in the old days when
[54:00] we'd come to church and brother brother
[54:01] dale talk about all the calls that he
[54:03] would get about questions and whatnot do
[54:06] do we still now you see there was maybe
[54:08] a lot of contention back then and people
[54:10] arguing about stuff but but you know
[54:12] they cared
[54:13] do we still care enough do we care
[54:16] enough to have questions that we need to
[54:18] answer do we care enough that
[54:20] when somebody preaches something that we
[54:22] go home and study it out or are we just
[54:24] ambivalent well it don't matter what i
[54:26] believe but it does matter what you
[54:28] believe
[54:29] it matters what you believe because if
[54:32] you don't believe the right thing then
[54:34] you'll die
[54:36] i'm not talking about spiritual well it
[54:38] could be spiritual it could be either
[54:40] one yeah there you go
[54:42] either one
[54:44] and brethren said in abraham's covenant
[54:46] confirmed when all these sins begin to
[54:48] get like that in the days of sodom women
[54:50] half naked running through the rooms off
[54:52] the hotels and man drunk falling behind
[54:54] them
[54:55] that ain't off somewhere else
[54:57] that's here
[54:58] and then what happened
[55:00] god said i've come down to find out
[55:02] whether all these reports are true
[55:04] the true children crying out come lord
[55:07] jesus
[55:08] how many true children do we have
[55:10] tonight maybe i wonder not now it ain't
[55:12] you can't answer that question by
[55:14] raising your hand because maybe many
[55:16] hands will be raised that ain't really
[55:18] signing crying that don't really care
[55:20] anymore but the true children are being
[55:22] going to be crying out because why
[55:24] they're what are they crying out for
[55:26] they want all the gaps to be filled in
[55:29] what are they crying out they look out
[55:31] and they see the gap's not feeling in
[55:33] other people's lives
[55:34] they want those gaps to be filled in
[55:36] what do you well when you surely the
[55:38] ministers when you go out to a
[55:39] minister's meeting and see the calamity
[55:41] that some people the way some people are
[55:43] preaching doesn't that make you want to
[55:45] cry out oh god surely lord so
[55:49] lord you you've got to help us
[55:51] and east brotherhood said as we asked
[55:52] the other night as the holy spirit told
[55:54] us in the bible only seal those who sigh
[55:56] and cry for the abominations did in the
[55:59] city
[56:01] where would they be sealed
[56:02] where is the sealing of the people let's
[56:04] not be deceived
[56:06] let's be right
[56:08] we want to be right don't we
[56:10] right
[56:11] and almost right
[56:14] is always wrong
[56:17] if you're almost right if you're almost
[56:21] in the holy of holies
[56:23] you ain't got it yet
[56:25] if you're almost saved you're not saved
[56:28] yet if you're almost on home plate you
[56:30] ain't you ain't made the score yet right
[56:32] if you're almost there you ain't got it
[56:35] yet
[56:38] how did it start
[56:41] brother i said god made the man out of
[56:43] the earth
[56:44] and then if you want this is a really
[56:46] interesting quote and the serpent seed
[56:47] he said years and years after he made
[56:49] adam years and years and years passed
[56:56] and the man didn't look quite right
[56:58] by himself
[57:00] so god put him to sleep
[57:02] and he made a woman out of a real now
[57:04] you go study out a rib online it's fair
[57:06] they said oh
[57:07] there's a rabbit trail we could go down
[57:08] but a real actually has a head and a
[57:10] neck and a body in that straight even a
[57:12] doctor will tell you a rib has a head
[57:14] and a neck and a body
[57:16] go look at that if you want that's
[57:17] that's free
[57:20] and brother and said a woman is just
[57:21] part of a man
[57:23] and when a man takes to himself a wife
[57:25] and if she's correctly his wife
[57:27] a god-given wife
[57:30] she'll be just to him as part of him
[57:32] amen
[57:34] he said there's the reason you got so
[57:35] many scruples in marriage
[57:37] because you're not part of one another
[57:40] in other words you don't you don't
[57:40] really love one another well you got all
[57:42] these scruples in marriage he's talking
[57:44] about what he's talking about is when
[57:45] you get married and the woman starts
[57:47] getting older and the man looks at her
[57:48] and like
[57:50] you got now you got maybe yellow teeth
[57:51] and you got saggy a little bit and and
[57:54] uh maybe you know your hair doesn't come
[57:56] like there's some white in your hair and
[57:58] you don't look the way with see he's
[58:00] talking about love
[58:02] when you love one another
[58:04] and when you love your wife and she
[58:06] loves you back and you're in agreement
[58:08] and and oh my there's peace in your home
[58:10] and you're both christians and you're in
[58:12] a one accord about how to raise your
[58:13] children we want to have a godly home
[58:17] you don't want to kick that woman out
[58:19] like like people in the message got all
[58:21] scrupled up if i want my wife don't want
[58:23] to have me a child i'm just going to
[58:24] boot around well what about love what
[58:27] about love
[58:28] love
[58:29] that's why brother bryan said you ought
[58:30] to pray first
[58:32] pray first before you enter into these
[58:33] things because a woman is part of you
[58:36] and this man when he was created god
[58:38] separated his spirit and he took a piece
[58:40] off the man his side and made a woman
[58:41] out of it
[58:42] and then he took the feminist
[58:44] dany spirit of a man and made a woman
[58:46] out of it and he made the man
[58:49] masculine
[58:51] burly
[58:52] oh you think about how brother ram
[58:53] described adam walking around in the
[58:55] garden of eden
[58:56] now he was a real man
[58:59] he said he said he he had a big black
[59:02] beard that come down and come maybe down
[59:05] to here
[59:06] yes he did y'all don't be frowning at me
[59:08] now he said it
[59:09] [Laughter]
[59:11] he had a black beard to come down and he
[59:13] had that long hair that come down to his
[59:16] shoulders and you think oh you think you
[59:19] you go look online to see pictures of a
[59:21] model with a with a big beard or
[59:23] whatever that don't compare nothing to
[59:25] how adam looked he was a real man
[59:28] he was somebody that that knew how to
[59:30] run his household he knew he knew how
[59:32] when when when the wind wasn't blowing
[59:34] right he he didn't he wanted everything
[59:37] to just be perfect he'd speak to the
[59:38] wind and speak to the mountain to move
[59:40] it out of the way so it wouldn't so
[59:42] maybe it blocked the sun so his wife
[59:44] could get a little a little rest or
[59:46] whatever
[59:47] this is coming fresh
[59:51] and the brother brown said when you see
[59:52] a man that's little you know manicuring
[59:54] his fingernails and slicking his hair
[59:56] down and holding his mouth open in front
[1:00:00] and such stuff as that one of these
[1:00:01] pretty boys you just remember says
[1:00:03] there's something wrong with that bird
[1:00:05] why because god wants a woman to look
[1:00:07] like a woman and a man to look like a
[1:00:09] man and when you get off of that
[1:00:12] he said you're something wrong you
[1:00:14] better keep an eye on it god wants you
[1:00:16] to be a young man he wants you to be a
[1:00:18] real man and you young ladies you you
[1:00:20] look for a real man somebody that will
[1:00:23] know how to run his home according to
[1:00:26] god's plan
[1:00:29] let the dip we want the difference to be
[1:00:30] real clear
[1:00:32] i want we i want somebody to know that
[1:00:34] i'm a christian i want somebody to be
[1:00:36] able to tell that i'm a christian i
[1:00:37] don't want somebody to think that i'm
[1:00:38] towing up against the line and see how
[1:00:40] close i can get but i want the
[1:00:41] difference to be real clear
[1:00:43] and god wants to see real men and women
[1:00:45] that ain't towing up against the line he
[1:00:47] wants to see a real man that's not
[1:00:48] seeing how close to looking like a woman
[1:00:50] he can get but wearing some kind of
[1:00:53] carrying some kind of pocketbook looking
[1:00:54] thing around or carrying some letting
[1:00:56] his hair hang down in his eyes but he
[1:00:58] want god wants a man that looks like a
[1:01:00] man
[1:01:01] and brother ryan said adam was the
[1:01:02] handsomest man that ever lived
[1:01:06] and eve was a perfect woman in every way
[1:01:09] and one place he said the star looked
[1:01:11] like the stars were shining in her eyes
[1:01:12] the starlight you think about you think
[1:01:15] about what you would imagine a beautiful
[1:01:16] woman to look like today but eve was far
[1:01:18] beyond that
[1:01:20] because god when god does something he
[1:01:22] does it right
[1:01:24] and i believe god adam was a real man a
[1:01:26] man that would handle you know that's
[1:01:28] what a man is a man handles stuff
[1:01:30] a man don't make his make his wife go
[1:01:32] out and do all the all this all the all
[1:01:35] the get on the phone and do all the
[1:01:36] things but he handles stuff he goes and
[1:01:38] takes the car to the mechanic or does
[1:01:40] the changes the old himself he he does
[1:01:42] all that stuff because he that's what a
[1:01:43] man does is he handles stuff
[1:01:46] adam handled adam handled naming the
[1:01:48] animals he handled rearranging the
[1:01:51] mountains he handled providing he had to
[1:01:53] protect protect and he handled loving
[1:01:55] and adam wouldn't have put up with none
[1:01:57] of the serpent's nonsense that's why the
[1:02:00] serpent had to get eve away because he
[1:02:02] knew adam was a real man adam's standing
[1:02:05] there in the garden with his big broad
[1:02:07] shoulders and his big chest and that
[1:02:09] beard come down in his hair uh he was a
[1:02:12] a model of what a man is
[1:02:14] not some kind of
[1:02:18] and the serpent had to get the woman
[1:02:21] away
[1:02:22] and said yea
[1:02:23] hath god said you shall not eat of the
[1:02:25] tree
[1:02:26] of every tree of the garden
[1:02:28] and the woman said unto the serpent
[1:02:31] we may i know it seems like i'm going to
[1:02:33] be long tonight but i'm not
[1:02:36] we may eat of the fruit of the trees of
[1:02:38] the garden but of the fruit of the tree
[1:02:40] which is in the midst of the garden god
[1:02:42] has said you shall not eat of it neither
[1:02:44] shall you touch it lest you die and the
[1:02:46] serpent said unto the woman you shall
[1:02:48] not surely die for god doth know that in
[1:02:51] the day you eat thereof then your eyes
[1:02:54] shall be opened and ye shall be as gods
[1:02:56] knowing good and evil
[1:02:59] why would you want to know
[1:03:00] evil that's a lie the devil tells a lot
[1:03:03] of these young kids
[1:03:05] you come away with me and i'll show you
[1:03:07] a good time
[1:03:09] come to this nightclub come to this bar
[1:03:11] drink some of this alcohol smoke some of
[1:03:13] this weed and i'll show you a good time
[1:03:15] and then you then you really do have
[1:03:16] some knowledge of good and evil you know
[1:03:18] with the prophecy of isaiah about jesus
[1:03:21] said butter and honey shall he eat that
[1:03:22] he may know to refuse the evil and
[1:03:24] choose the good now there's something
[1:03:25] you can study out what's butter and
[1:03:26] honey butter is butter is the word and
[1:03:28] the and honey is the law of the lord and
[1:03:30] you you meditate on the word of god and
[1:03:33] his law and then you'll know how to
[1:03:35] refuse the evil and choose the good
[1:03:38] god wants you to stay away from the evil
[1:03:42] your doctrine matters
[1:03:45] correct understanding matters
[1:03:47] that's why it's so important to know
[1:03:50] what the baptism of the holy ghost is
[1:03:53] what the new birth is
[1:03:54] how to be born again
[1:03:56] that god can take you through a process
[1:03:58] of his works of justification
[1:04:01] sanctification the baptism the holy
[1:04:03] ghost
[1:04:04] that god you believe and you begin to
[1:04:06] turn aside and then god cleans you out
[1:04:08] and
[1:04:08] kicks that unclean spirit out of you and
[1:04:11] then fills you with his spirit after you
[1:04:13] had a chance to study and meditate on
[1:04:15] the word a little bit through a
[1:04:16] sanctification process
[1:04:18] adoption
[1:04:20] false anointed ones what a false
[1:04:21] anointed word is the godhead the third
[1:04:23] pool the seven seals all these things
[1:04:26] are important don't let the devil never
[1:04:28] put in your mind that it's not important
[1:04:30] that you don't need these things because
[1:04:32] this is what shores up a real believer
[1:04:34] there is a right and a wrong and almost
[1:04:37] right is always wrong all you think
[1:04:40] about that story in the bible
[1:04:42] when the ephraim ice
[1:04:44] came up to that river to cross over into
[1:04:46] gilead
[1:04:47] y'all hating with me just a little bit
[1:04:48] longer y'all actually doing really good
[1:04:50] tonight i don't know if it's my
[1:04:51] preaching or what
[1:04:53] maybe maybe it's all right
[1:04:56] the aphromites came up to the river
[1:04:59] and and they had to they had to answer
[1:05:00] that question say shibboleth
[1:05:04] now if they didn't say it right
[1:05:06] almost right was wrong
[1:05:09] and almost right was gonna get your
[1:05:12] gonna get you a sword through your heart
[1:05:14] and if they if they didn't say it right
[1:05:16] now now see they could try real hard to
[1:05:18] say to shibboleth but if they couldn't
[1:05:21] frame it right because they were from a
[1:05:22] different part of the country because
[1:05:24] their accent they would say sybil s
[1:05:26] instead of shibboleth and then they died
[1:05:29] because almost right is always wrong see
[1:05:32] it matters it matters what you believe
[1:05:35] it matters when you hear somebody say
[1:05:36] well you always had eternal life
[1:05:39] and i'm just going to lay some of these
[1:05:40] things down and we'll close it and we'll
[1:05:42] close in just a moment it matters when
[1:05:44] someone when you hear somebody say jesus
[1:05:45] didn't have the holy ghost until the
[1:05:46] river jordan he went all these years
[1:05:48] without the holy ghost now we're not
[1:05:49] putting people out but it matters it
[1:05:52] matters how who you believe jesus is
[1:05:55] it matters the new it matters when
[1:05:57] somebody says the new birth is you you
[1:05:59] is when you just realize that you
[1:06:01] already were eternal it matters because
[1:06:04] that's wrong it's not just you realizing
[1:06:06] at that moment that you already had the
[1:06:09] new birth in you it matters when you
[1:06:10] hear somebody say well we're already in
[1:06:12] the millennium
[1:06:13] no we're not in the millennium because i
[1:06:15] thought satan is satan is supposed to be
[1:06:17] bound for a thousand years when we're in
[1:06:18] the millennium it matters when you hear
[1:06:20] somebody say well you don't need to
[1:06:21] assemble with other believers
[1:06:23] it matters because the bible says that
[1:06:25] we do need to and you get a blessing
[1:06:28] when you come to church and gather
[1:06:29] together with other believers you get a
[1:06:31] blessing
[1:06:32] it matters when you hear somebody say
[1:06:34] well i can just get it for myself
[1:06:36] listen i need some help i don't know
[1:06:38] about y'all but i need some
[1:06:39] if somebody somebody that's kind of
[1:06:41] going up the ladder a little bit going
[1:06:42] up jacob's ladder and climbed a few
[1:06:44] rungs i can sit under them for a little
[1:06:46] bit and get some get some words of
[1:06:48] wisdom and get some help
[1:06:50] oh it matters when somebody says well we
[1:06:52] only needed the five full minute when
[1:06:53] they twist ephesians 4 11 and said we
[1:06:55] only needed a five full ministry until a
[1:06:57] prophet came and then we don't need it
[1:06:59] anymore because now we got the full word
[1:07:01] it matters because that's not right
[1:07:03] that's not what ephesians 4 11 saying
[1:07:05] it matters when somebody says well i'm
[1:07:07] born again because my mama said i was it
[1:07:10] matters
[1:07:11] because you ain't born again just
[1:07:13] because your mama said you all right
[1:07:16] you ain't born again just because your
[1:07:17] mama says that you ought to be offended
[1:07:18] at the preaching
[1:07:20] you ain't born again when somebody says
[1:07:22] you don't need to mature i don't preach
[1:07:24] growth that ain't right
[1:07:27] and it matters
[1:07:28] it surely doesn't matter it matters when
[1:07:30] somebody says you get it all when you
[1:07:32] believe now just sit down and wait at
[1:07:34] the bus stop it matters
[1:07:35] and that ain't right
[1:07:37] aren't you glad for the truth tonight
[1:07:39] aren't you glad to be sitting in a
[1:07:41] church where the spirit moves where the
[1:07:43] where the truth has been preached for
[1:07:44] all these years
[1:07:47] no another story we'll just we'll just
[1:07:49] relate just for a second you know when
[1:07:50] when paul got got hauled in front of a
[1:07:52] king agrippa there agrippa and festus
[1:07:55] were sitting up there
[1:07:56] and paul got a chance to tell tell his
[1:07:58] testimony and paul got he started
[1:08:01] lighting letting loose and he got to
[1:08:03] where jesus died and rose again and
[1:08:05] fester sprung up and he said paul
[1:08:07] you're touched in the head you're crazy
[1:08:09] when he started talking about the
[1:08:10] resurrection power festus jumped up and
[1:08:13] said you crazy paul so paul turned his
[1:08:15] attention from festa and he started
[1:08:17] talking to a gripper
[1:08:18] and he said then agrippa said unto paul
[1:08:20] almost he started he started telling a
[1:08:23] gripple he said
[1:08:25] surely you agree with what i'm telling
[1:08:27] you surely you believe the prophets he
[1:08:30] he started appealing to agrippa's
[1:08:32] knowledge of all these things that he
[1:08:34] was talking about the history and the
[1:08:35] context and agrippa said unto paul
[1:08:38] almost
[1:08:39] thou persuades me to be a christian
[1:08:42] and paul said i would to god that not
[1:08:43] only thou but also that all hear me this
[1:08:46] day with both almost
[1:08:48] and all together such as i am except
[1:08:50] these bonds the musicians should go
[1:08:52] ahead and come forward don't stop it
[1:08:54] almost
[1:08:55] don't don't stop it almost cause almost
[1:08:58] ain't good enough
[1:09:00] almost right is always wrong
[1:09:03] don't almost save ain't saved almost
[1:09:05] born again and born again almost free is
[1:09:08] not free and almost sober is not sober
[1:09:11] almost clean it's still dirty almost
[1:09:13] ripe is always wrong
[1:09:16] the serpent's lie was almost right let's
[1:09:18] stand to our feet and worship god
[1:09:22] we just got we've got a husband and if
[1:09:23] we'll stay with him a spiritual husband

[1:14:37] that since the prophet left we've had 60
[1:14:39] years of preaching at the end of his
[1:14:41] sermon the end of his life we've had 60
[1:14:43] years almost half that 120 years about

[1:14:51] that's right
[1:14:53] god shut the door amen
[1:14:55] god said that's enough

[1:15:34] right that's right
[1:15:35] why did those she bears eat those
[1:15:37] children because the children
[1:15:41] talked against
[1:15:43] elisha called him an old ball head but
[1:15:45] you know what they didn't know nothing
[1:15:46] probably some of them kids were little
[1:15:47] tiny kids that didn't even know what
[1:15:48] bald head meant
[1:15:51] but sitting around your living room come
[1:15:53] on
[1:15:54] and what you say to your kids
[1:15:58] about what happens in this church or
[1:16:00] message or whatever
[1:16:03] it ain't their fault it's yours
[1:16:06] hey man that's right
[1:16:07] time for us to repent and go on
[1:16:10] my man
[1:16:13] parental delinquency
[1:16:16] amen
[1:16:17] just think about
[1:16:18] that this
[1:16:20] this weekend we've got the uh
[1:16:23] um youth day
[1:16:25] on saturday at three o'clock it's open
[1:16:27] to everybody everybody can come
[1:16:30] uh to the service but it will be catered
[1:16:32] and for the youth um we're gonna try to
[1:16:34] get here maybe around two o'clock
[1:16:36] brother ronnie long's gonna come in
[1:16:37] friday night
[1:16:38] and uh he's bringing his whole family
[1:16:40] with him so there'll be a there'll be a
[1:16:42] van full just to his just his kids
[1:16:45] all right so
[1:16:46] bring somebody with you or uh we need to
[1:16:48] get this gospel out
[1:16:50] amen
[1:16:51] some of you are already doing um
[1:16:54] desserts um

[1:16:58] gonna do some anna and abby are gonna do
[1:17:00] some uh but i need some help with work
[1:17:04] um

[1:20:11] unless you all want to
[1:20:13] we can just fellowship for a little
[1:20:15] while and then go get something to eat
[1:20:16] but we will only have one service sunday

[1:20:21] like it always has been but we won't
[1:20:23] have a second service all right
[1:20:25] uh anything else jim i don't miss
[1:20:27] anything else
[1:20:31] if i do i'll send you a whatsapp
[1:20:35] i got a whatsapp just the other day
[1:20:38] strange that you call brother tim
[1:20:40] humes name
[1:20:42] i got a whatsapp from him asking how i
[1:20:44] was doing and asking how brother dale
[1:20:46] was doing
[1:20:47] and uh inviting us to a meeting so
[1:20:49] we conversed for a few minutes so
[1:20:52] i haven't quit praying for those people
[1:20:54] i have not quit praying brother branham
[1:20:56] said i think i read the quote several
[1:20:59] months ago he said if you're not willing
[1:21:01] to go get that person
[1:21:04] that you need to be in the altar that's
[1:21:05] right
[1:21:06] let god shut the door yes right we're
[1:21:09] not going to shut the door
[1:21:11] so if they want to fellowship with i'm
[1:21:12] not going to fellowship with no another
[1:21:14] doctrine
[1:21:15] but i'll sure shake his hand and call
[1:21:16] him brother
[1:21:17] and man brother branham did he shook his
[1:21:19] hand called him brother call he said
[1:21:20] i'll call the bolt brother right anybody
[1:21:23] said he said i'm not gonna kiss his ring
[1:21:25] but i'll call him brother amen
[1:21:27] so just pray for those brothers i do i
[1:21:29] pray for them every night
[1:21:30] for those brothers that are that have
[1:21:33] um
[1:21:34] basically got an evil spirit on them
[1:21:37] maybe not so much turned the message
[1:21:38] down but got a spirit on them and and we
[1:21:41] can see that that brother brown told us
[1:21:42] that even that brother uh ramsay said
[1:21:45] i'm not serving the lord no more i'm
[1:21:47] gonna go out and
[1:21:48] just start drinking and not come to
[1:21:50] church anymore and you know what brother
[1:21:52] ryan said he said about six months later
[1:21:54] he was dead
[1:21:55] because god took him off the scene
[1:21:57] because he didn't want to marry his name
[1:21:58] he took his he took his child home so he
[1:22:01] must have been born again took his child
[1:22:03] home right so he wouldn't marry his name
[1:22:05] so we we're praying for that group of
[1:22:07] people
[1:22:08] that are that are against the message of
[1:22:10] the hour and uh but we want to press on
[1:22:12] and be the message of the hour we don't
[1:22:14] want to just
[1:22:15] no we want to be it
[1:22:17] there's somebody going to be here
[1:22:19] somebody's going to be there
[1:22:21] we're just praying that we all going to
[1:22:22] be there and we're all
[1:22:24] and and like bob said i i'm not going to
[1:22:27] apologize for what i said sunday there
[1:22:29] was some people might got offended for
[1:22:31] calling the name i called but my lord if
[1:22:33] you don't want your kids saved
[1:22:36] there's something wrong with you you're
[1:22:38] right sister there's something wrong
[1:22:39] with you if you don't want your children
[1:22:40] saved and filled with the holy ghost i
[1:22:42] don't want mine just to make it on a
[1:22:44] deathbed confession that's right now
[1:22:46] maybe that that's okay
[1:22:48] but i want them in this church
[1:22:50] i want them to be i want them to be
[1:22:52] involved
[1:22:54] amen if we have to build another church
[1:22:56] so we will build another church i don't
[1:22:57] care but i want them involved i don't
[1:22:59] want to just make it by the skin of
[1:23:00] their teeth come on i want them to be
[1:23:01] involved i want to have young ministers
[1:23:03] i want to have young sisters that can
[1:23:05] play the instruments again and again and
[1:23:06] again
[1:23:08] that's what i want i want somebody to
[1:23:10] say amen
[1:23:12] not just make it by the skin of their
[1:23:13] teeth now some might but that's okay
[1:23:16] but i want somebody to be like brother
[1:23:18] bob said i'm fill those gaps in yeah
[1:23:21] because you know if there's a gap that
[1:23:23] was ease problem
[1:23:24] there was a gap in eve that's right she
[1:23:27] didn't believe in hebrews 13 8 brother
[1:23:28] brown said that's where she missed it
[1:23:30] right
[1:23:31] not that god wasn't god because she
[1:23:33] couldn't deny that because she met him
[1:23:35] every day
[1:23:36] but there was a gap in there that satan
[1:23:38] stuck that peg in and said i got you now
[1:23:41] well that's what we're trying to do i
[1:23:42] believe we're screaming out trying to
[1:23:44] get people in the ark but remember it
[1:23:46] was seven days before it started raining
[1:23:49] right right so noah had to mature a
[1:23:51] little bit
[1:23:53] while he was sitting in that arc waiting
[1:23:56] for god to cap off what he had preached
[1:23:58] and we pray that that i was thinking
[1:24:00] about this other day what brother dale's
[1:24:02] been preaching for all these years i
[1:24:03] pray that god will kept that thing off
[1:24:06] in a group of people
[1:24:08] in us it's not going to matter if it
[1:24:09] just stays on tape or stays in a book or
[1:24:12] goes through the airwaves it's got to
[1:24:13] come inside of me and you
[1:24:15] and then we got to live it out right and
[1:24:17] i believe we can bob i believe we've got
[1:24:19] a full ministry that can take us home
[1:24:21] that's right
[1:24:22] to the coming of the lord amen
[1:24:24] it's not none of this is none of this
[1:24:26] has been in vain
[1:24:28] it's all had a purpose it's all had a
[1:24:30] plan it's all had its time
[1:24:32] and i believe we're in the time now to
[1:24:34] where like i said before we're screaming
[1:24:35] out get in the ark
[1:24:37] because god's getting ready to shut the
[1:24:39] door remember the third pull is to the
[1:24:41] totally lost
[1:24:44] that can't ever be saved
[1:24:47] but it's also to the bride
[1:24:49] it's also to the church
[1:24:51] but it is to the totally lost jesus went
[1:24:54] and preached to the souls in prison no
[1:24:56] way they could be saved because they
[1:24:58] send away their damn grace
[1:25:00] amen listen we're one day closer to the
[1:25:02] rapture
[1:25:04] believe it or not
[1:25:06] whenever it comes we have become one day
[1:25:08] from yesterday we're one day closer

[1:26:46] true love

[1:27:07] luis is going to go get it but we'll
[1:27:09] kind of figure out between now and then
[1:27:11] where we're going to get it from amen so
[1:27:12] you love the lord
[1:27:14] let's bow our heads
[1:27:16] lord thank you for this time that you
[1:27:17] give us
[1:27:19] thank you for the words that you give us
[1:27:20] lord
[1:27:21] whether they be harsh
[1:27:24] you said in the book of revelations that
[1:27:27] oh it was so sweet when you ate that
[1:27:29] book
[1:27:31] when john ate the book it was oh it's
[1:27:33] like honey
[1:27:34] but boy when it hit his belly
[1:27:37] and he had to live what was in that book
[1:27:40] it became bitter because we are contrary
[1:27:42] as i've been preaching we need a
[1:27:44] renewing of our mind
[1:27:46] to get away from this contrariness from
[1:27:48] this false doctrine from this
[1:27:51] false security that that as i was
[1:27:53] thinking the other day
[1:27:55] lord it's just like the denominations
[1:27:57] they they don't even preach on hell
[1:27:58] anymore because god's such a good god
[1:28:02] that everybody is going to heaven well
[1:28:03] that's not going to happen
[1:28:06] you're a good god but you're a just god
[1:28:08] and you said if you believe on me
[1:28:11] the works that i do and you do also and
[1:28:14] if you believe in me i'll give you
[1:28:15] everlasting life but if you don't
[1:28:18] there will be torment
[1:28:20] lord i pray that you'd save us save
[1:28:22] every one lord that we come in contact
[1:28:24] with
[1:28:25] lord may we be a light that shines on
[1:28:28] all the people whether we go to work as
[1:28:30] brother bob says i want people to know
[1:28:31] i'm different i want people to know i'm
[1:28:33] a christian
[1:28:34] that when they need something as we're
[1:28:35] talking about we'll come up to the
[1:28:37] virtue there that virtue is strength
[1:28:39] it's something somebody can pull from we
[1:28:42] want somebody to be able to pull
[1:28:43] strength from what we say and for what
[1:28:45] we do lord i pray that you'd be with us
[1:28:47] lord as we continue on
[1:28:49] lord as we go home lord that you'll be
[1:28:51] with us as the wheels turn some have to
[1:28:52] go a little bit further than others
[1:28:54] father we pray that you'll just be with
[1:28:55] us this weekend be with brother ronnie
[1:28:56] and his family they're driving down
[1:28:58] friday they will have a wonderful time
[1:29:00] in you lord and you'll be with us and
[1:29:02] and save souls and fill them with the
[1:29:04] holy ghost and make us better christians
[1:29:06] lord that's why we're here we thank you
[1:29:08] for all things we give you praise and
[1:29:10] honor and glory
[1:29:11] in the name of jesus christ we pray
[1:29:13] amen god bless you you're dismissed
