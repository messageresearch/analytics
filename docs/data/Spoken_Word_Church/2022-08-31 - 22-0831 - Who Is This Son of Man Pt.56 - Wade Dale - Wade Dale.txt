also we'll announce it again i did not bring it tonight but we'll announce it on sunday so i think that's all who is this son of man part 56 i want to bring something a little bit this afternoon or this evening that kind of struck me i was um looking at some things and sometimes when you look at something you go man that looks just like and then boom there it is but i want to read you this is my quote of the day from it is i be not afraid 1954 brother brown said now moses had had less than the boy talking about the boy the boy had some food he was talking about a uh the boy that had the five loaves and the fishes the boy had some food moses had a dry stick in his hands what we've been talking about we've been talking about that aaron's rod in moses hand it was nothing else but a stick that he'd picked up perhaps on the desert but once when that hand of faith took a hold of that stick it became god's judgment rod to the world what a difference a position makes and that's what we're going to talk about tonight later on and then next sunday about because we gotta start up the statue of perfect man we're going to look at position because it's got to be a position and tonight we're going to talk about three different things about the cross and i i think you'll see why this is a progressive revelation this is a progressive message and it took a progressive message to bring us up the statue of perfect man and then once you get in the statue of perfect man it brings you to another level and the son of man revelation because remember we're still in the son of god dispensation under the baptism of the holy ghost but we are under the son of man dispensation as far as the opening of the word when those seals open that put us in a different class brother brown even calls us i'll read it this weekend brother brown says a different class of people you are a different class of people one with prophetic insight wow have you ever tried to use that moses stretched that rod he stretched the rod over the sea he stretched it in the air it was god's judgment rod those egyptians could have ever got that rod from moses they'd had the israelites whipped boy look that's a physical stick and what that's what takes today as the rod was in moses's hand so is the name of jesus christ in the church's hand oh my you know you hear people and i was looking at some comments and people made online and different things about uh you know you say well god protected me what god you always talk to people that are not real christians they kind of let in between they talk about god they can't call jesus christ's name because that gets too personal but they can say god do you understand what i'm saying they can say god and it could be a stick a tree a house but when you change jesus christ it brings it to a person all right so we have the name of jesus christ the correct way the correct water baptism we know he's not a third person the trinity we know he's not a second person of the trinity we know that he's almighty god in human flesh all right so what is the name of jesus christ in the church hand if the church will hold that name of jesus esteem it and honor it and quit using it in slang and so forth see the world they use that name all the time they use it in a slang word amen and use it in power though us use it in power and reverence it will conquer every enemy that god that god's got on earth every enemy in my name they shall cast out devils you didn't say god you can say father son holy ghost all the time you want to the devil's not going to move but when you say in the name of the lord jesus christ that brings a personality involved that brings a person in my name they shall cast out devils in my name they shall lay hands on the sick all these things in his name let's bow our heads lord thank you for this evening that you give us we pray now that you settle this lord help us lord to speak what we got on our heart to the people and father we pray that you should be the ones that are sick be the ones lord are not with us lord for different reasons father we pray that you'd go and minister to them lord we know that some are sin sick some are backslid some are just struggling with life lord and i pray that you just comfort each one father be with us here tonight lord anyone in this building that's sick or are a little bit troubled on different things lord may the holy spirit come in with that salve and just relieve the relieve the pain father because this earth is just nothing but pain and lord i pray that you should be with us and bless us and forgive us of our sins lord in the furthermore this service be the ones that are that are watching in and listening in lord we pray that you'll just be with them lord sanctify us for this journey in jesus name we pray amen let's read this one scripture and you'll be seated john 1 1. in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh has that become more real to you and the word became flesh personal so who was that who was the word who was the flesh of god all jesus christ so it all comes back bro johnny you got to say jesus and you know who he is and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be seated in the lord as blessing to the reading of the word and as we get started in this i got this little thing around my finger and i don't know who in the world i don't know whether it was some young child or something but i was driving the other day and and we were going down the road and this little thing was on my antenna and and as i was driving brother bob it starts going up the antenna then it starts spinning around so which one of you children did this i like it i'm gonna go put it back on there hey sophia oh you pointed at jonas i knew you'd tell all i had to do was say hey all right lily i thought maybe it was lily back there in the back she was smiling but she probably knew who did it too so i figured it was somebody a little bit taller than those girls a little bit taller that could reach and put jonas don't look back in the back there's nobody back there with you buddy so thank you very much it was very entertaining and i'm going to put it back on there because you made it where it'll go almost to the top and and won't go any further and then when i get slower it drops down so thank you for that i'm gonna wear it on my finger if that's all right first thessalonians 4 4 says that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor and the reason the reason i keep reading this it's more to me it's like a training exercise we are in a training exercise you and i are training every sunday every wednesday every time you read the bible every time you pray you are in training because listen this is a battle you don't fight a battle you don't just jump up out of the out of kindergarten and start fighting battles know what brother donnie how many weeks do you go to six weeks six weeks of just rigorous just to get in the army six weeks of training six weeks and and they call it hell on earth and that's naturally but what about spiritually listen you're in a fight for your life from the beginning of the time that you come into this world you are in a fight every one of us is in a fight and we got to know how to fight and who to fight amen well i think we've been told how to fight and i think we've been told who to fight because the brother brown tells us that we now have satan's answer well what's the question who is he where is he and what's he doing the same way as when jesus christ was revealed in the seals when the seals was opened what did it do when that door opened when that seal opened outran the devil outran the devil four times out the devil just kept going away going away going away well that's what we're looking at now we're we're looking at the unclean spirit going out of a man on in justification sanctification then we're looking at sanctification even still more as we go up this statue of a perfect man but there's something we got to realize that when we get to a certain place this is what we got to see that's what we're going to look at this afternoon so but every one of you should know how to possess his vessel donnie knows how to take an engine apart and put it back together bob donny right huh may not even know if it's under the hood or the or the trunk i'm talking about him not you okay but why training he's done it a hundred times could do it with his eyes closed bob's done it none he just calls it he just calls the guy to come fix it right why there's not he's not learned in that place well now you and i gotta learn i know we've given all we've been given these virtues but brother brown said without the holy ghost these virtues are a stumbling block to the believer all right and even the unbeliever all right somebody with me that's why you see people falling away you see people that don't grow you see people that backslide they stay backslid all the time they're not here tonight one more time right hey man so we got to know how to possess our vessel in sanctification and honor romans 12 2 says be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind i was thinking the other day you know we can't help the things that go into our mind everybody with me on that we you can't help what goes into your mind but you can help what you meditate on used to you would meditate on that what i'm going to do friday night and there's a there's a christian song that's that's that's on the radio now contemporary christian song that talks about thank god for sunday morning i thank god for every morning but they put so much emphasis on getting to church well you know what i did when i was out in the world sunday was my checkup day i checked up make sure i was still alive i had other things on my mind my mind was toward the world and the things of the world on sunday was just kind of my reboot day that i rebooted and got ready for monday well now what is it my sunday now is yeah it's a reboot but it's a renewing of my mind it brings me back and reminds me of things the ministers all the ministers and and even testimonies it should bring back in your memory the good parts amen the good parts that we've lived through we remember the bad listen devil will never let you forget the bad parts but let's start dwelling on the good parts by the renewing of your mind so when you come to church you shouldn't even have the mind you had out there you should let the holy ghost take over let him raise up a little bit higher inside of you and let him take over and teach us something because that's the only way we're going to make it because no man can teach you the bible tells us no man teach you anything right but the holy ghost inside of you will agree with the word put a teacher or a preacher in the pulpit and then that teacher inside of you will say that ain't nothing but the truth or that brother don't know what he's talking about all right but only by the renewing of your mind are we going to go up this statue of a perfect man because it's like i said before this is abnormal it's not even hardly human it's more supernatural than it is natural everybody with me because virtue is not a natural not having a intercourse you know being a virgin that's good commendable should be done that way but that virtue is strength and power and the beginning of character that we have to build up inside of ourself so that so that you know you have confidence when brother donnie calls brother dale or we call brother dale or we call some of the ministers and we have confidence that that person will either give us an answer or go to god and get us an answer or or have the answer already well see that's virtue that to me that strength that's power you wouldn't want i wouldn't want to call now my postmatcher she's a wonderful lady it's really nice super nice very very reverent in in as far as letting me off and doing things that i need to do but i'm not going to call her and ask yourself what's that scripture mean are you right there's no virtue there there's no strength in that amen that's why bro that's why jesus brought brother jesus that's why jesus told us that you shall receive power dunamis or dynamite you you're gonna you're gonna receive power once the holy ghost comes upon you and that will give you strength what the strength of you no the strength of god and what is god he's the word so the strength is in the word of god everybody with me so you'll be transformed by the renewing of your mind look that you may prove you got to prove amen we're going to see a transfer of power here in a few minutes that was one of the most powerful things ever happened on the face of the earth when jesus christ was crucified on a cross but there's another part to that there's a furtherment of that because he talks about taking up your cross you don't have to hang on a cross he's already hung on the cross for you but you got to take up your cross and follow him we'll get to that in a minute but we know the first stage is the birth we've been on that i want to make sure that we understand if we're not going we cannot go up that statue of perfect man without having the new birth you can go so far with your peacock feathers or stuck in your blackbird everybody with me but you want sooner or later these feathers are going to come out power without character amen that's what we're looking at we're looking at a lot of people that thought they had a lot of power people like tim humes and him and i was a man calling his name prayed for the sick cast out devils did many mighty works but he turned the message down what are you going to do with that gifts and callings are without repentance balaam knew how to get an audience with god satan knows how to get an audience with god talks to him lip there all the time what about me and you sometimes we can't get anything right so gifts and callings but now these these virtues we're going to look at when brother brown talks about them being molded and the bible talks about compacted when when tnm and all you know you see people do foundation built foundations another brother gary's done it too but but do you just put it on sand and just just start pouring no you compact that place that you're gonna use have you ever watched them build a bridge they take that big thing up in the top with a great big hammer looks like and what do they do they drive that i-beam all the way down until it hits solid something well that's hitting solid ground and you know what that bridge will be there for 100 years but if you just tap it down there just about three or four feet could you imagine that bridge would collapse before they even got it built the weight of the bridge would take it down so i don't want the weight of sin to bring us down if we just sit there and tap our little foundation down in the ground about this part i want us to be rooted the bible says rooted and grounded all right it's what we're talking about last time we preached we talked about being grounded stuck in the ground you know rooted by the rivers of living water romans 8 verse 14 says many are lived by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry have a father that adoption is what adoption is your placing so each one of these are going to be a placing it's going to be you're going to be placed into the body absolutely placed in the body as the sun if you're born again with all the privileges heirs and joiners right here with spirit itself bear witness with our spirit that what that we are the children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ whatever he's got we got and this is him this is his character so he has give us an opportunity to take on his character all right but you only can do it by justification sanctification in the baptism of the holy ghost you cannot do it any other way you can't just wake up one day and say i had this in me all along it's just coming to life yeah there's something coming to life all right but you gotta have like brother keith reed says an experience i like what brother keith puts that empathy so you gotta have an experience of god you gotta have an experience and man it don't have to be you don't have to be shouting and jumping up and down and running all over the all over the place but you gotta have an experience you gotta have something where you can say hey that's where god revealed himself to me and started putting the word together started helping me put the word together amen because before that what did we do you took the denomination they said well we think he said this we think he meant that well i don't know how to explain the trinity ask somebody explain the trinity yeah you better take a couple hours because they're going to have to they're going to be uh amen but we know what it is and it's so plain and simple it goes right over their head it goes right over the scholars when brother bran was preaching to those scholars i'm sure they're they're they're thinking and their their their foundation was on that doctrine if you deny the father you deny the son if you die of the son you deny the father oh that's right you got to have the father son and holy ghost just like you've got to have justification sanctification baptism holy ghost you got to put them all together to make one god we know that then now we talked about giving you a new spirit does everybody understand that because i'll keep going over and in the lord some of these i have deleted off of here as i continue on but some of these i can't just can't delete them so maybe somebody still needs them maybe it's me maybe i'm not explaining it right i always try to blame myself that i'm not explaining it right everybody with me if y'all get any louder we're gonna be in trouble he said he'd give you a new spirit now that spirit isn't god's spirit does everybody understand i want you to go back in your your walk go back into your whatever you want your journey and i want you to know that that you remember when something started changing when that old nature was like man that stinks i don't want nothing to do with that no more i mean you get tired sick and tired of being sick and tired and you want to want a new spirit look brother brown said that's your spirit though that's yourself talking to you understand that but what had happened is god's right there close he's right there close with you and he's leading you and guiding you into the truth because why did the unclean spirit leave because there was a new spirit that was not familiar with that old spirit so it went out that's your spirit god gives you a new spirit then he says i'll put my spirit in him that's when he puts the holy ghost in and then seals you in but the thing god has to do is give you a new spirit make your nature a little more gentle and settle down or he couldn't even live with you now the baptism of my holy ghost seeing you have purified your souls now look so that will probably mean if it says seeing you have purified your souls that it wasn't pure at one time can we just surmise that or can we make the assumption i know you're not supposed to assume but i'm reading it by plain english seeing you have purified your souls why would you purify it if it was already pure no it was lost the you was black the u was lost the u was smutty dark cloudy full of sin god nowhere to be found seeing you have purified your souls what and obeying what the truth obeying the truth of god through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently we get into brotherly kindness like brother brown said is going to knock some of us off brother brown said i don't care if you scratch my back i'm going to scratch yours anyway i don't care if you scratch mine it doesn't depend on you scratching mine back a lot of us have a problem with that and it's wrong it's iniquities and that you know to do better we know as as human beings as brothers and sisters in christ we know if we're doing something wrong and we do it anyway it's iniquity that's why the bible says iniquity shall abound oh that's for the world not for us i'm not worried about the world the world is not in iniquity they're in sin iniquity is knowing to do better and not doing it or know not to do it and you do it anyway that's we're all guilty of that but being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever then we were looking at the tabernacle we see the ark of the covenant we'll look at that in just a minute that's the most holy place which is the holy of holies and then that middle part right here is the holy place remember that's where the unclean spirit goes out in your sanctification that is sanctification so there's a candlestick there's an altar of incense there's a table of shoebread eating the word of god you got the candlestick which you've got who's standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks like unto the son of man the bride speaking of the bride heading into this part right here and then continuing on into the holy of holies everybody with me what a glorious thing but now all this out here on the outside though look the lava the altar of sacrifice real messy real justification wise uh bad days good days but it's not going to matter when you get back into here where that ark is it's real quiet only you and god that's all you and god that's the only two people in there as you and the lord and then we're gonna talk about that in just a minute so there's our little picture you see how covered that is the holy place in the holy of holies you can't even see it shut in with god in a secret place there in the spirit beholding his face giving you what power to run in this race oh i love to be alone with god that's why our prayer life that's where i miss it and that's where i guess a lot of us all miss it is in our prayer life you know i know we we we pray without ceasing i know i pray all every day for every little thing that comes about i'll say a prayer for but do we really like i want to talk about we're doing you know get into a place and just be shut in with god where nothing is going on except you and god and so you talk to him and let him talk back to you now we're going to look at this in depth a little more i'm like brother louise i can't get out of this so i can't get off of this ark and and uh but there it is there's the ark and we've seen it over here but remember what was the ark the ark was and i'll read it in just a minute it was made i would but it was overlaid with gold everybody with me on this it was overlaid with gold it wasn't completely gold now the seven golden candlesticks were gold beaten gold not the ark the ark was acacia wood with gold laid over it and then we saw that there's what the two tables which is the law everybody with me and the brother brown said to what that the manna was the top of the holy ghost and then that stick that butted is me and you wood speaks of humanity everybody with me and that humanity though once put in where the word is at come on somebody it put in there where the word is at guess what happens it changes a life comes in there whether it was dead there's life now and not just life it actually i just caught this it identifies who it is almonds i'm an almond tree why because i produce almonds i'm a christian because i produce these virtues i'm a christian because these things happen in my life but if you look at that stick now if you look at that stick it just like a stick could be an apple orange pear but once it starts burying fruit once something goes out on the end and you know what happens when you take something like one let me pick one okra you take okra the the power of okra the whole idea is to get the power brother john into that fruit because that's where the seed is that's where the procreation is going to happen because if it don't put a seed out and that seed falls in the ground it's not going to bring forth again so the power so what i do with my okra plants i was reading online and they and it really it works because you see my okra plants they're really high and the fruits up here like this why i cut all the suckers off i cut all the all the unnecessary pieces come on somebody cut the unnecessary god comes in the into your garden and cut your unnecessary pieces off amen tear some of us limb to limb that's good enough for me but remember what that does danny that takes the power in the roots and it pushes it because if it pushes it out here and there's like 20 different limbs or or leaves and you know okra's got great big leaves there's a lot of power goes into that which is nothing right sure it sure it sustains the plant but that that power's got to get in the fruit and i can produce more okra that way by trimming it up same way with a couple of different things tomatoes are the same way cut the suckers off we cut the suckers off of corn because it sucks the life that's why they call them suckers we've had a bunch of suckers stuck to us amen sucking the life out of us hello somebody whatever sucker you want to call it it's a sucker suck the life right out of you and satan is a master sucker but there you've got the ark of the covenant which we know that that types jesus christ because there's the law there's the holy ghost which is the manna which god produced then that's a rod that god planted somewhere down the line a long time ago and it grew up and they cut the thing off and it became dead we explained that last time it became dead somewhere along the line it was alive in the garden of eden but it became dead but it took god what a supernatural event when they put that rod in there and that thing started budding and not only budding not only leaving leafing it put fruit out so all that energy it's not connected to anything so it was the energy of god so now look let me see if i can get that moved over a little bit tada so the ark is a symbol of the son of man who is the son of man jesus christ he's the law he's the prophet he's the word of god he's the holy ghost and he's human oh what yeah how many times have we told you the son of god is not a human being in that we are human beings the son of god is a spirit theophany but the son of man is flesh so i keep reading john 1 1 14. because brother brown said who is this son of man he said in the beginning was the word where was god in the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us so watch this right here brother i'm on the ark jeffersonville 1955. now watch the ark of the covenant he said you shall make it out of acacia wood and overlay it with gold anyone who knows the scripture knows that gold speaks of deity and wood speaks of humanity so watch how perfect this thing is you could have made it out of pure gold but it wouldn't fit the scripture it wouldn't affect jesus christ because you've got to have humanity but there's a but there's something that's holding back the judgment what's this the word speaks of humanity see he said you shall cover it overlay it with gold over the wood that's wood that's me and you he's going to overlay it look that's deity over the wood what does wood speak of humanity our frailty our humanity but you overlap with deity look christ over the church i guess y'all just not getting it like i got it deity over the wood christ over the church inside and out deity overlaid you'll have a lid on top of it it'll be a mercy seat and all the look all the laws will rest in it now what is the law the law was a schoolmaster to bring us to christ but the law was do's and don'ts in the old testament how about with me right it actually brother brown said put you in jail it actually give you no way out right you were dead under the law brother the bible says dead ain't trespassing sin everybody with me and all the laws will rest in it but before you you sprinkle it with blood what sprinkle it with blood over the mercy seat is brother louise the mercy seat's on top the ark's at the bottom the mercy seats on top with the two cherubims the law speaks of judgment watch this but between the law and the congregation between that law that was inside the ten commandments and the people outside there was gold deity had to stand in your place there had to be a buffer the congregation there was something for deity stood in its place top of christ between the wrath of god the judgment in hell between that and the believer stands deity himself christ standing in the way with an atonement blood to save us from our sins and to heal us from our sickness deity stands in the way between judgment that's what that art stood for it wasn't just a piece of something it wasn't just and yeah it was in the holy of holies but it had a it had a plan and a purpose it was deity standing in our place we were caught inside of that box we were caught inside of the box folks i don't want to hit my still got my i still got my heart monitor on and i still have a heart because look that little thing's beeping i gotta wear it for another week but all is well but deity stands in the way between judgment listen if you were to pull those two tables of stone up we'd all be dead if we had to go by the ten commandments thou shalt not thou shalt not hello somebody but deity the gold stood in the way listen we're gonna see it just a minute a beautiful picture of deity over laying wood on a cross he stood between the wood and the people and they hung him on a tree they hung deity on a tree there you are your daily walk your daily talk so here we go we're going to start in this part that i'm trying to get to there you are your daily walk your daily talk your daily behavior so what we're going to do when we go through this statue of perfect man we're going to talk about just our daily life amen the things that we do where do you have your trouble when you're at church not so much when you're asleep not so much your daily life you're waking hours and don't try and some of y'all may try to sleep it off but you can't do that get up the crack of noon your daily behavior your heart your soul and all is holy holy holy to the lord no roots of bitterness no roots of bitterness brother brown said that's what will kill a church it's a root of bitterness holy holy holy and to the lord as we begin to approach in behalf of our brother whosoever will may come anointed blood in front of him the blood going remember the priest had to hold the blood in front of him and he sprinkled the mercy seat with the blood holy holy holy into the lord now that was the outer court the holy place and the holy of holies that was god's sanctuary on earth and we talked about fruits the other day we'll skip through that pretty quick because why did moses put the rods in the in the ark in the first place we understand why because why there was people murmuring complaining there was deacons wanting to be preachers there was preachers wanting to be evangelists there was amanda's wanting to be pastor if people had a better idea than the pastor's god or then the deacon's god or then the elders have yeah that's what it was they were bickering they were bickering the congregation was bickering amongst each other and god said i'll shut you up listen if moses would have went in there and and did some you know something and come out and say well no it had to be god because he knew there was 12 dead sticks went into that ark 12 dead sticks because each one from each tribe handed it to moses even aaron from levi handed it to moses he took all 12 took him in there laid him down in front of the ark next day he walked in there not a one but one 11 were still dead but one the tribe of levi the preachers now that doesn't mean the preachers don't want to bear fruit but the preacher ought to bear fruit first i'm sorry the preacher ought to bear fruit first like peter now how would it be if peter was going now y'all need to act like me before calvary let's cut some ears off let's let's start let's start cussing at people hello that's the way peter was before he got born again but once he got born again let's go to ii peter where he says add to your faith a virtue your virtue knowledge your knowledge temperance patience brotherly kindness and love it took a man that had what protected the first fruits moses laid up the rod before the lord and the tabernacle witness it came to pass it on tomorrow moses went into tabernacle and behold see even the people knew that nobody went into that holy of holies except either the high priest or moses and if aaron stayed out which he had to because he handed him the rod moses took the thing back there the prophet went in and laid it down so then we've got to look at a vindicated prophet and what and know that he went in first he went in and got it first from god spoke lip to ear and he turns around and says aaron's rod it's butted and brought almonds so i want everybody to get in their place nathan cora they wanted to have their own deal they wanted to make their own kingdom for their self right bob make they have their own kingdom back there but you know what god shut them up the word always comes out first so the god said okay i'm going to bloom this thing and i'm going to give them some almonds to look at not just blooms because you know you might think well there's still enough life left in there but just like i said before the energy to produce fruit is twice what it is to produce anything else because fruit is the energy of the plant so it's got to go up through that stalk and out into the sure it's got to go through the leaves but that's where the photosynthesis is that's where it gathers it's light but that root is the your when you you don't put your fertilizer on you now unless you get liquid but you normally don't put fertilizer on your leaves where do you put it put in the ground so what so the water can dissolve it and the what the roots can suck it up through the stalk out into the what the almond tree or whatever you wanna your tree washing of the water by the word of god all right moses brought them all out and the lord said unto moses bring aaron's rod because i'm going to keep it for a token against these rebels read it and thou shalt quite take away their murmuring from me that they die not let's not die spiritually by murmuring and complaining amen let's try not to do that jesus said the hours come that the son of man should be glorified verily verily i say unto you except the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit see that's kind of strange but jesus is looking right back at the tabernacle he's going hey i made aaron's ride bud i made aaron's rod bring forth fruit out of a dead stick but if it die it brings forth much fruit everybody with me jesus said in matthew 15 but he answered and said every plant which my heavenly father hath not planted shall be rooted up romans 6 4 therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that what our old man is crucified with him look we were crucified with him it's what we're getting into what i'm going to talk about in a minute we were crucified with him we were not on that cross but we were on that cross inside of him like i was telling you right when brother william was here that struck me the other day you know it kind of and i'm not trying to play god but but if if you try to portray god as this all all-knowing all-seeing totally infinite no no day when he does just what i did i went uh what's my next thought right he don't have those he's just an all-eternal all-speaking all never had a never had a a pain or an ache i was sitting the other day and this thing went off and said it was disconnected and i thought well am i breathing have i done passed over well i stood up my knees started hurting my back started hurting in my and my shoulder started hurting i said nope i'm still here but god didn't have a day in his life did he hurt until he became in flesh so there to me is a struggle because jesus when he when god was put into humanity father let this cup pass from me but nevertheless not my will but thy will be done god had to change his form not only change his form he locked himself into that ark he locked himself into humanity he had to come wood but deity we just couldn't see it but that's what came he came to his own and his own received him not but once once once brother donnie he made the decision before the foundation of the world in eternity he made a decision to go through that womb and to become a human being and have to breathe like me and you now there's some miraculous things that he did but there's not a recording that he walked through the ocean no he walked on top because he was a human he wasn't a fish he was a human but it was miraculous that he walked on it because he changed the elements but still there was times when look there was times when he had to sleep sleep so hard that the boat was about to capsize and his pearl disciples they got mad at him you sleeping when we're dying and he's over going that was his humanity but when he woke up when we wake up put your foot on the boat somebody's gonna have to wake you up physically and spiritually knowing this that our old man is what crucified with him when he went to the cross there was no way to get me and you out once he became a baby once he became emmanuel god with us god wrapped in human flesh once he became that there was no way for him to come out until he died until he died melchizedek was different remember melchizedek created a full-grown body stepped into that body and met abraham right but that wasn't our savior now inside of there was the savior but he didn't come the way we came so he we couldn't be heirs and join airs with melchizedek there was no there was no there was a humanity there but he wasn't locked in what did he do brother brown said he just stepped out and as aaron always says those 16 elements just fell to the ground went right back into the earth but now when he came into human flesh there was no way that he could pull himself out and be somewhere else be something else he was deity he was wood wrapped in deity gold frankincense and myrrh deity dedicated to be a dead stick knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is free from sin everybody with me the prophet of god said the power decision he said put aaron's rod in there an old dead almond tree but as it went under the shekinah glory everything it was was restored again that's the way a sinner is when he goes under the shekinah glory of the holy spirit the veil drops behind him everything that he ought to have been a son of god what blooms out in him again amen listen before the foundation of the world there's uh some of the brothers sent me a clip of a brother preaching and they all still going back to the all the seeds were laying in the ground when the earth was made well now you got to take the quote where brother brown said that seed was placing you before the foundation of that before the foundation of that is when it was placed in you now go back to the scripture go back to what brother brown said they asked him a question brother brown what were we before we were born he said you were nothing right only in the mind of god were you anything there's to see the word was already there the word for you to blossom in bloom but you were born a dead stick no way out everything he ought to have been a son of god blooms out in him again amen remember overnight it budded blossomed and grown almonds on it fruits of the spirit love joy long suffering goodness gentleness patience that's what we need to get in the third step get over into the shekinah glory talk about going to the second bale where that little sacred light was hanging over the mercy seat prophet of god said oh why is my people so tossed about they took aaron's rod and laid aaron's rod in the presence of this holy place and when they did in one night's time it butted blossomed and yielded almonds in one night's time think of it in the presence of god this old dead rod lying there in the presence of god butted blossomed and yielded almonds in one night what was it then what kind of a rod was it it was an almond tree rod that's what he'd taken it from the stick was off of an almond tree and you are a stick some kind and you were taken off the branch of humanity which was god's created son in the beginning which was god's creative son in the beginning you may be fallen dead alienated from god but by that in creation you were created to be a son of god you may bounce around be respected and honored out here in the courts he's talking about the outer outer court but if you ever get into that glorious place and hide away with god you'll yield what you're supposed to do that's what i want us to do let it out yield what you're supposed to yield be whatever you're supposed to be let that thing out what a beautiful picture it is today of a consecrated life who once enters into the with christ dead to the things of the world hid away with god and the veil dropped down around and all the world shut off then christianity and religion becomes a pleasure a pleasure to every believer why are we so tossed about watches right here today people just have enough religion to make them miserable wow knowing that they ought to do this they're trying to escape hell well if that's the way i felt about it brother i don't know what i would do oh get in with christ shut off from the things of the world commune with him and to commune with him as well it's a pleasure it's beautiful it's something that fills and satisfies the soul something that gives you peace that passes all understanding all the crosses become flying wings all the burdens are chariot wheels oh you can fly away now he can let that spirit grow and take out all the roots of bitterness and press god's way look press god's way through him again and he can become back in the same condition right same condition that he was in the garden of eden talk about this mountain be moved statue of a perfect man if you die you take the blood out of a man you're embalming trouble of it is a lot of them never got embalmed you take the blood out of a man he's gone then the only thing you can do is put another blood back in him he's going to live again you took his blood out and now we put the blood of jesus christ in sea and that brings the faith of jesus christ the virtue of jesus christ the knowledge of jesus christ the temperance of jesus christ the patience of jesus christ the godliness of jesus christ the brotherly kindness of jesus christ and the love of god which is jesus christ everybody with me he's the head and controls you and your feet is the foundation faith a man controlled by the head takes the that's why the headstone had to come back in the end time to fully control his bride he only controlled what the word was laid out for each age amen but not the fullness we now have the fullness of the word but with that comes responsibility with that comes responsibility to not just say i want to be born again because we're going to get into just a minute we're going to see about this cross that we've been talking about there you are there's the perfect man of god when he possesses these virtues now once you look at this this was the chart that we had when we first started justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost brings you to what brings you to the new birth are not you bring to the faith of god and then when he gives it to you it's your faith amen bible says add to your faith so there's a transfer of that power jesus when he stood he said go to jerusalem where you'll be endured listen i give you power i've given you a temporary power to cast out devils and do all these different things but the devil got involved judas was there the whole time but now i'm going to bring you into a place where judas is not going to be able to cop i'm going to get you into the upper room and i'm going to give you my power and when i give you my power it's going to become your power so if you move that 1 2 and three over to the middle and we can't because it says faith what does that look like a what a cross looks like a cross right because i want you to look at something we'll read it in just a few minutes i got it out i knew about it because it's the only way jesus could have carried his cross you can't carry a three or four hundred pound cross that wood was almost 400 pounds it was the top beam is what he carried doesn't that kind of look like a beam let's talk about just a minute is everybody all right wake up for a minute all right now this is the total of everything that we've been talking about so we see that we haven't even got to the son of man so we're now the virtues are the son of god revelation but each one of those to me if you'll visualize each one of those brother joe looks like a bar faith virtue knowledge temperance looks like a bar if you pull them all apart just like i did before there's a bar there and it's a bar that you got a bear cause that's the top beam of your cross everybody with me now there's three kinds of crosses there's three kind of things that you can do with the cross you can be the enemies of the cross you can get to the cross and then you can carry a cross but now remember there was only one cross that jesus died on the bible said he died once for all so there's not several different crosses everybody with me for salvation there's only one cross then there are some that never come to that there are the enemies of the cross then there are some that get to the cross but don't get any further then there's some that takes that beam and carries it and the cross was made out of wood it was overlaid with deity when he hung there on that cross that was what would humanity his humanity but he took that judgment he was the gold that stood between me my humanity and the people he stood and took my sin so that way we don't have to have a cross for sin and shame anymore we have one remember brother brown said a lot of people can't get him off the cross that's why the catholic church has crucifixes which is jesus on the cross that's a crucifix that means they can't get him off the cross we as christians we don't carry we carry empty crosses is your cross still got jesus on it better not because he didn't go to pentecost if he didn't get off that crop hello somebody come on you say that's silly it's not silly it's exactly what it is brother brown said some people can't get him off the cross and a lot of people get to the cross and say oh 2 000 years ago he he did this for me that's all right it's a story you're right it's a good story makes you cry and weep because you know you look at the passion of the christ you watch the movie sorry folks it was all staged in that movie i told you what ruined it for me was you watched that movie for some time and and then you know you got they did all the sliced him up and diced him up and put the crown on his head and had blood everywhere and i saw behind the scenes part of the movie and you could see him sitting there eating chicken looked just like jesus hanging on the cross but he wasn't he was an actor and he was hungry he was eating chicken just like me and you so that kind of took away the from the uh the the the part that that's supposed to be real and they made it look real but that was a real man did that his name was jesus christ deity hung on humanity for me and you so no we don't have to go that's why we don't have to put him back on the cross that's why brother brown says i indict this generation for the second crucifixion they put him back on the cross amen because of their creeds they put him back on a cross they couldn't get him off the cross and get him into the people so there's enemies of the cross there's people that get to the cross and then there's people that carry your cross everybody with me so the cross was made out of wood overlaid with deity he hung there and listen folks i'm going to read you exactly what the crucifixion process is everybody with me all right stay awake i hope i'm not born you the process based on roman literature as well as descriptions in the provinces crucifixion was an established routine there were several military teams led by centurion remember the centurion was there and in the provinces the soldiers were selected from the local auxiliaries natives who had joined the roman army the victim was stripped and lashed or scourged the bible talks about scourging jesus as part of the public humility and i want to stop right here because i didn't get the i didn't get the full um it was another quote but you know they didn't they didn't they didn't put murders on cross what'd they do with barabbas he'd let him go do you know who got put on crosses political dissidents and religious idiots are religious fanatics because they wanted to hang them on a cross for public humility so that they'll uprise listen if you if i went murder brother boyd back in the in that time if i wouldn't murder him i was just a murderer that didn't that didn't incite a riot that didn't incite a crowd but you let a political dissident stand up and say this government's wrong and you start getting followers or you get this like jesus raise it you know destroy this temple i raise it up in three days that's who they hung on crosses as a public humiliation listen that's why you and i if when we pick up our cross yeah we're going to be humiliated publicly your sisters are going to wear your long hair your brothers are not going to act like the world a part of the public humiliation he or she was led through the streets and remain naked you know that for a fact when jesus was put on the cross folks it wasn't he didn't have a loincloth on that was put there for uh we'll read it right here christian art portrays jesus with a decent loin cloth on the cross but the nakedness was maintained as part of the humiliation there was a public plaque titleist indicating the crime the shedding of blood and the context concept of corpse contamination meaning that the execution took place outside the city walls because of contamination everybody with me the most popular spot was along one of the main roads leading into the city this also served as propaganda purposes to demonstrate roman law and order the victim did not carry the whole cross only the cross beam everybody with me amen there's your bean because you got a bear watch this is the rest of it these killing fields contained permanent upright poles dead sticks the victim did not carry the whole cross but only the crossbeam the combined pole and crossbeam weighed approximately 130-180 kilograms which is three to four hundred pounds there's no way a human man can carry the whole thing after scourging the trauma and loss of blood there was a risk that the victim could die before arriving at the site of the execution the necessity of keeping the victim of light alive led to the practice of the legions commandeering someone from the crowd to help carry the beam when the victim succumbed this is the role simon of serene in the gospel remember he picks up the cross and carries it for jesus all right upon arrival the the victim was either tied or nailed to the crossbeam which was then hoisted up which made it worse you're hanging just by your hands until they set you on that upright pole and attach you to it it's pulling your it's pulling the ligaments of your arms i mean it's horrible hoisted up and connected to the vertical pole with ladders and pulleys we have evidence of the use of nails from several sources they were five to seven inches long tapered iron spikes the application of the nails varied seneca reported that some were hung upside down remember peter was hung upside down or with arms stretched out on either side josephus reported seeing crucifix victims at the seas of jerusalem do you remember in 70 a.d remember god told them said get out of jerusalem titus besieged and they eat their own kids they crucified them where the soldiers positioned them in various poses to amuse themselves out of anger and hatred some people collected the nails as magical amulets you know we know now that the catholic church says they have so many nails and you know these got so many nails and jesus must have 40 or 50 nails in him that ain't going to make no difference none at all so let's read what the bible says look in philippians 3 verse 18 for many walk a vuma high have told you often and now tell you even weeping paul's weeping because they are the enemies of the cross of christ there's people will never accept it there's people that are what brew beasts made for destruction they're never going to even get to the cross they deny the cross they deny jesus christ they deny there's even a god so we're not talking about those whose end is destruction they're not even counted in the religious community whose end is destruction whose god is what their belly and that's a metaphor they're not just a belly what their riches their fame their fortune their gut their person that's all they care about and whose glory is what their shame i mean i deliver mail and i'm sorry i'm a human being but but you got the the biggest magazines have the biggest naked women on them why do they do that they think it's wonderful i look at it as shame that a woman's putting herself out there going to kill billions of other millions of other people who mind the earthly things now look let's go here now remember there's enemies of the cross they don't even care about what we're talking about tonight all right colossians 2 verse 14 this is paul against is blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross now he's talking about mine in your sins everybody with me he's nailing it to his cross there was one cross on golgotha and that's the only one we need we don't need another cross like that he died once for all by everybody with me but for christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words lest what the cross of christ should be made of none effect wow look for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishly what brother brown said you've got to crawl over the cross to get to hell right every person in the world's got to walk right by that cross to get to hell for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishly i'm going to try to find that quote where brother brown says never forget calvary never forget what happened at the cross listen we can be revelated with all these seals and vials and plagues of daniel 70 weeks but if we forget the cross you better you better remember how you got the knowledge you got for the preaching of the cross of them that point perish foolishness foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of god now let's see if we can live this he that loveth father and mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and that's actually even a red letter it's jesus talking everybody with me he that loveth father and mother more than me you stay out of church because your mom and daddy comes to visit you if they're not believers son and daughter comes in town you take a day off of church just to visit with your family they're watching you like a hawk they know that your religion ain't good it's just it's just a formality i come to church on sunday regardless if june's daddy's there or not there he will he can drink his coffee alone and he knows that amen but most people would say no now my my daddy's coming i ain't seen him in two three years well that's your fault if you ain't seen your daddy or mama or something two or three years that's your fault but it always happens on sunday remember or wednesday night you know we go to work monday tuesday and then wednesday we get a sinus infection or our cat's got diarrhea or something you know going on or we get some kind of little ailment on wednesday but now thursday morning god heals us and we go right on to work just like nothing happened then we get close to the weekend i don't know what's come over me i do the devil but now look what verse 13 y'all got quiet and then started laughing now watch this he that taketh not his cross he's transferred all that power of the cross now he's transferred it into what not just getting to the cross but bearing your cross he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me he that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loses his life for my sake shall find it what my whole life your old life i'm like brother branham you know he and he even tells the story he said you know what he said to keep from from i guess from uh from uh um i don't know what uh same way with me i got busy on sunday like i said i don't go to church i got busy on sunday i scheduled stuff to do on sunday i went deer hunting or i went to a place i didn't you know you never mind brother branham now he tells a story he used to wax and wash his car on sunday and watching people go to church a prophet i wonder where the seed was then so anyway then jesus said unto his disciples now what is a disciple there's people that know jesus there was 500 brethren that knew jesus there were 70 that walked away they were not considered or ever called disciples disciples is one that follows a leader then jesus said unto his disciples if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross jesus never says take up my cross he says take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it thank god i have lost my old life and so have you if you're born again you've lost your old life amen mark 8 verse 34 this is another part of what jesus was talking about when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also his followers he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me now i like this one luke is a physician he's more precise watch what he says none of the other one says this he's the only one that says this right here and he said unto them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily that puts it real intense well i'll take it in a few days and then i'll lay it down or i'll take up his cross daily and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it luke 14 verse 27 said whosoever doth not bear his cross and come after me why this is this is what we're this is what we're after he went first he was the first fruits he showed these characters he showed these fruits of the spirit he showed what it was and he showed it in the first church age first second third church age he showed these virtues and then he got lost man got to arguing and complaining sounds like today and whosoever does not bear his cross what bear his beam bear his beam and continue on not past the cross but with your cross that'll make you happy it's telling you what you got we got you say oh that's kind of i don't know bear burdens listen you never did have nails put in your hands i promise you that and you didn't hang there for almost five hours on a cross suffocating to death that's why they broke their legs if you didn't know that a little history you know why they broke those two guys legs number one was it was beginning to be the sabbath and they didn't want to leave them hanging up there the whole weekend so they would break their legs so they would suffocate faster but jesus has already had control of everything he said into thy hands i come in my spirit he was already dead wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight and ascend with us so easily but set us and let us run we gotta run with this beam we don't just walk with it we gotta run with it run with patience the race that is set before us what looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith our faith for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god and you know what he's saying come on come on i did it i did it you don't have to do it like i did all you got to do is pick up the beam all you gotta do is pick the beam up and follow me pick up your beam pick up your face virtue knowledge temperance and follow god last thought that's the position some don't even want some of them don't want to cross they don't care about the cross some of them use it in you know evil ways some come to the cross some may get born again come on somebody some may get born again come to the cross salvation salvation of the lord is of the lord justification even come to the baptism of the holy ghost but you got to pick up your cross and follow him continually on what the bible says to the regeneration or what the regening of me and you to regen this guy not make me look different but change me can you carry that beam god's already took it to the cross he's already hung there for me and you but he requires that's a requirement in matthew mark luke and john that's not a suggestion that's a requirement if we are going to get a position in christ we're going to have to bear must jesus bear the cross alone in what all the world go free no there's a cross for everyone and there's a cross for me must jesus bear this cross alone but you look in the bible and we'll look we'll keep going on further with this the bible even talks about bearing each other's burdens he says my yoke is easy and my burdens are light and we're wanting to make them heavy no i think i said it says right here look who for joy wow who for joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame listen he hung naked and when he died there's no doubt it was a mess his body fluids you know when somebody dies it wasn't pretty but he didn't care he did it for me and you he's just asking us to take the beam the beam of faith the beam of virtue knowledge temperance let's stand to our feet come on musicians he asked us to take those not getting nailed it was already the bible said our sins was already nailed to the cross already nailed he's already took our sins but what we're going to do is build character build character by a position looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith the bible says add to what add to your faith so as i said before that dunamis or that power that jesus said you will be endued with dunamis or power he's transferring every bit of that on to me and you what are you going to do with it i'm asking you tonight you're going to carry it on or you're just going to keep sitting here for another i hope we're not here another 20 years i'll be 80 or 82 years old somebody is going to have to live this thing right here and not just live it but show it and it's not burdensome burdensome right if you do it in the right way it's a position you look at people at work and and i'm i've always been i've never been just staying where i was at at work i always wanted advance i always wanted to own a company and i did several and was successful several million dollars in sales we grew while i was the owner of the business that's no pat on my back but it's why it it's a drive i sure didn't get that getting up the crack of noon i'll promise you that sometimes june knows i got up at four and five o'clock in the morning loaded them trucks myself and went in the early part of our life that wasn't enough to sustain us so i would go on fire from from seven o'clock to 11 o'clock at night just to make some extra income and then go load my truck and start over again so don't tell me about work but this is a different kind of work to me this is pleasurable sometimes that was not this should be pleasurable oh i got to go to church oh if i got to go wear another dress i think i'll just go sneak around no you ain't sneaking i'm not looking at y'all i'm not i don't know why i looked over here but in god there is no sneaky man he knows it before you did it so there's no sneaky you might sneaky against your parents you might think you get by with it but you know what what brother brown say he said a christian sends a sin he will reap a tub full amen because you know what that's that iniquity thing you know to do better and you don't do it or either you do something you know you shouldn't do we need to think about that because you know what i read that scripture the other day i was reading it where iniquity will abound in the end abound so that means people do whatever look at this world they do what they want to do it don't matter if it's right or wrong they do it anyway with no consequence but they're going to have a consequence but let's not be enemies of the cross let's don't just come to the cross let's don't just find the cross let's bear a cross let's bear each other's burdens let's bear with each other somebody stumbles don't don't kick him while he's down right be like simon or cyrene reach over there and pick the thing up for him if you have to carry him for a little while so what jesus carries your sorry rear end didn't he when he was out in the world in our ups and downs and our stumbles back and forth he carried you and you know what he didn't grumble one bit so let's don't grumble gripe and complain no root of bitterness that's what we're going to keep talking we'll go up the statue of perfect man it's a position that all this is a position listen we're christians we've come to the cross we know that god died for me and you in human flesh we know that we know he's that rod that butted but you know what now you're a rod you have come to life you have blooded and now you are to produce the life that was in that limb let's sing a song god bless you think about these things [Music] and renew our right spirit within me are you laughing [Music] think about it and renew [Music] david slipped up moses slipped up aaron slipped up cast me but there's a perfect one that we looked to when he born [Music] i'm sure they were buzzing around his head that day [Music] remember brother ryan said satan said oh i got you now buddy i'll bring you down here and i'll lock you up just like i want to step up from the beginning of time but when that man went downstairs it was a different kind of man it was god and that same god is inside of you tonight if you have the new birth same god gets the same results that's our problem we're going to show results but if it's not god you're going to see the results we're going to bear whatever life is inside your limb [Music] oh and renew a right spirit within me a change of mind and renewing not like [Music] [Applause] there's a new way of doing things when you become a christian not the old way and brother brother even said not even the old way pastime is the old man dead jesus was dead on that cross his body did not have any life in it at all but that theophany when he came out of that body you and i were in that theophany with him he went to hell you went to hell you don't have to go you already been he came up to mighty conquerors so that you can conquer you can conquer all the things in this life overcomers oh i've got i've got my toothpick i got my toothpick [Music] no it was a beam if the whole thing brother john weighed 300 pounds that thing probably weighed 100 at least and now the little frail jesus was trying to carry 100 pounds they had done beat him up all over the place they had whacked him all night that scourged him which means they whipped him and there he was naked walking through the streets with that beam on his shoulder sometimes we feel like we're having problems he took them all at calvary now let's turn that thing around and use the power of the cross [Music] to bear each other's burdens [Music] help brother dale different ones all of ministry help the ministry hold them up don't beat them down hold them up amen hold them up don't beat them down why i i heard a preacher the other day and i agree with him 100 if you don't make it to heaven it is not the preacher's fault it's your fault so don't name you can't come to the day of judgement and say well brother dale's the reason i ain't make it nope god's gonna say no let me tell you the day i tried to get you to do something and you didn't do it the day you turned against somebody i'm just telling you god's plane his judgment is true but that judgment has some deity had some gold wrapped around it and brother aaron that stood between us and us in judgment was that deity did he hang on a cross said into thy hands i come in my spirit there was gold deity dedicated to death taking your sin on the cross god bless you let's bow our heads dear lord jesus thank you for this day you've given us father we pray that something's been said lord that'll strike our heart and they will not just try to pick up as we said a little toothpick or a little stick but lord let us bear what we're supposed to bear let us get in the position that we're supposed to get in lord and let's run this race with patience [Music] look into you lord the author and finisher of our faith but that faith has a beginning and it starts at the new birth when we picked up that beam and we took off with it lord we not just only discovered the cross we discovered the cross that we carry that we have to take each day that we have to endure this world sickness pain heartache death of loved ones and all the different things lord all that's around us but you told us that if we'd forsake all that that we'd be your disciple we could be followers of you lord let us follow you right into a body change now lord as we start up the statue of a perfect man lord may you help us with these beams as as simon of cyrene stepped out of the crowd and and help jesus lord i know you don't need any help but lord each one of us do need help we need a simon to step out one day and pick up our beam and help us over this thing called life father just be with us and bless us be the ones that are sick lord we continually pray for each one lord that has needs father we ask you just bless us until we come back together lord on saturday night lord for bible study at six o'clock lord just bring the words of eternal life to us lord and may we see you more and more father and then be with us on sunday with communion and foot washing lord just come among us in a special way this weekend father we ask you to bless each one lord as they take their journey home that you'll give us lord this day our daily bread and let us chew on these things that we've heard lord and that we'll take them to heart father and just bless us now in jesus name we ask amen you're dismissed god bless you and renew a right spirit within me [Music] you
