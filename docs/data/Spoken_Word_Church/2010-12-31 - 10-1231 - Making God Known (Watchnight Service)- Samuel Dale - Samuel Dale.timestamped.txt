[27:18] to come out youd like turn in your
[27:20] scripture turn back where we've been
[27:22] reading from Revelations
[27:26] 1 and then we'll go to Deuteronomy
[27:30] 29 Revelations 1 Deuteronomy
[27:34] 29 now remember the Bible study that we
[27:38] generally have on the first Saturday of
[27:41] each month for this month will have to
[27:44] be the second
[27:46] Saturday because uh tomorrow would be
[27:50] the first Saturday so we won't be doing
[27:53] that but just remember that the second
[27:55] Saturday and also remember this is the
[27:58] worship meeting uh time the third
[28:00] Saturday at brother longor so you know I
[28:03] pray that the Lord would bless and be
[28:05] with each one
[28:06] amen I turn Minister meeting to all
[28:09] right the ministers meeting for the
[28:11] ministers will be here on the second
[28:15] Saturday at
[28:17] 11:00 and so remember that amen we're
[28:21] kind of off balance some of you maybe
[28:23] need to move over here keep the church
[28:25] flitting over cuz everybody's on one
[28:28] side from so far back but
[28:33] amen I'm going to try to preach the rest
[28:35] of the year so that's that's the best
[28:38] thing to do I guess end of year by
[28:41] preaching amen Revelations 1 Deuteronomy
[28:44] 29 our heavenly father we thank you Lord
[28:47] for an opportunity of being here tonight
[28:50] with brothers and sisters of like
[28:51] Precious faith and we pray that you
[28:53] would just bless each one of us Lord and
[28:55] lead us and father just Lord as we try
[28:59] to speak about you we would ask that you
[29:01] would come on the scene and one word
[29:04] from you would be worth more than all of
[29:06] the words that we could put together and
[29:08] all the studying and all the things we
[29:10] could do but for you to just come and
[29:13] just speak one word to our hearts we
[29:14] love you and we thank you as we come to
[29:17] an end of a year we thank you for all
[29:19] the years that we've had cuz it's been a
[29:21] wonderful time and a experience Lord and
[29:25] going
[29:26] into this next Year we're looking
[29:29] forward to more about you but we're
[29:32] looking most of all forward to seeing
[29:35] you in a Rapture and getting out of this
[29:38] world and moving on we love you father
[29:41] and we just commit everything to you now
[29:42] in Jesus name
[29:46] amen Revelations
[29:49] 1 we've been using this scripture for
[29:51] quite a while and we just keep using
[29:55] it it says the Revelation verse one
[29:59] of Jesus Christ now notice it didn't say
[30:01] the revelation of
[30:04] Jesus it says it's the way it wanted to
[30:06] say it revelation of Jesus Christ which
[30:10] God gave unto him now unto who unto
[30:15] Jesus gave it unto Jesus Christ
[30:18] see to show unto his servants things
[30:21] which must shortly come to pass and he
[30:24] sent and signified it by his Angel unto
[30:26] his servant John who by record of the
[30:28] word of God and of the testimony of
[30:30] Jesus Christ and of all things that he
[30:33] saw blessed is he that readeth and they
[30:36] that hear the words of this prophecy and
[30:39] keep those things which are written
[30:40] therein for the time is at hand now
[30:45] remember what we've done uh the past
[30:47] last service the time is at hand what
[30:50] the time when the revelation of Jesus
[30:52] Christ is to fully be made known the
[30:55] time is at hand the time to understand
[30:58] okay let's go back now to uh
[31:04] Deuteronomy I think I left out my my
[31:07] paper with all right Deuteronomy
[31:10] 29:29 says the secret things belong unto
[31:15] the Lord Our God but those things which
[31:18] are revealed belong unto us and to our
[31:21] children forever that we may do all the
[31:25] words of this law you may be SE Ed the
[31:28] Lord add his Blessing to the reading of
[31:30] the word now we have a lot of notes for
[31:35] you tonight and uh you know we want to
[31:41] just basically take our time cuz I
[31:45] announced that first time since
[31:48] 1971 we started here July the 4th this
[31:51] coming year on July the 4th will be uh
[31:54] you know the uh whatever the time
[31:56] service Falls will be uh 40 years that
[32:00] we've been here in the service so we
[32:03] just uh you know we want to continue on
[32:07] but we've always had a watch Night
[32:08] Service I don't ever remember of calling
[32:10] off one even for weather conditions
[32:12] we've had a lot of things but and but
[32:14] I've never preached one I always had
[32:17] somebody else but I wanted to try to
[32:20] express to you something that I see or
[32:23] you know I believe I see it and you may
[32:27] doubt it all right but and those hearing
[32:30] it may not agree with it but that's all
[32:32] right cuz I'm just myself and I I just
[32:35] always try to tell you what I believe I
[32:37] don't have any secret things you know
[32:39] the as we read during the scripture the
[32:41] secret things belong unto God but now
[32:45] that scripture lets me know one thing
[32:47] for certain there are some things that
[32:50] we will not know in this world about God
[32:55] now that's the key to the whole thing
[32:57] thing tonight is to see that they can be
[33:01] something after we leave this world and
[33:04] then that will take away a lot of things
[33:07] that people you know are tied up on and
[33:11] I know that there's a lot of doctrines
[33:13] about the
[33:14] godhead uh we're in a time now where
[33:17] that many things are going forth that
[33:19] you know uh there's people that believe
[33:23] that Jesus wouldn't God to the River
[33:25] Jordan that's their business I don't
[33:27] have any problems I just don't agree
[33:29] with it cuz my Bible said he was born
[33:32] Lord the Christ but you know that's to
[33:34] me is the thing I want you to see
[33:38] tonight I want you to see that we had a
[33:43] word
[33:44] Prophet now do you know what the word
[33:46] Prophet
[33:48] means it means a man who has no
[33:51] understanding of his
[33:54] own he yields himself to almighty God
[33:58] abely and he speaks to us and it is God
[34:03] speaking to us through a man now I
[34:07] believe that the man's not
[34:09] God but he's speaking to us and doing it
[34:13] now I'll repeat this again in a minute
[34:15] but I want you to think about
[34:17] it the prophet of God said every Prophet
[34:20] must line up his message with the
[34:25] prophet previous to him all right right
[34:28] you know every one of now not
[34:30] necessarily that this guy may be writing
[34:32] away over here and this and over here
[34:34] but just understand the point your
[34:36] Prophet is making he's making it that
[34:38] the word must line up from Genesis to
[34:41] Revelation all right now you're going to
[34:43] see a wonderful key in a little while
[34:45] though that will help us because you
[34:47] know Moses had no one to read
[34:50] from see all right he had no one to read
[34:55] from he didn't have a book that he could
[34:56] read about he didn't have a prophet he
[34:59] could line up with he had to get his
[35:01] message straight from God all right but
[35:04] see in the end time then we believe this
[35:07] messenger must get his message from all
[35:10] that's lined up prior to him and he
[35:13] can't add one
[35:14] word because if he adds one word to the
[35:18] Bible the curses upon him just as much
[35:21] as it is anyone else you know now I know
[35:24] brother brandom made human errors in
[35:27] speech yes I know that we all do we're
[35:30] in the
[35:31] message because that shows that he was a
[35:35] human it shows he was a mortal person he
[35:37] wasn't almighty God now people say now
[35:40] Jesus made mistakes well I different we
[35:42] there and I want to see it in the Bible
[35:44] but that's my point I I have to see
[35:46] anything I've got to see it in the Bible
[35:49] you say well brother Brown said so and
[35:51] so well all right it may take me 20
[35:54] years to study on it before I find where
[35:58] the Bible says it that's right but I've
[36:00] never found anything the prophet ever
[36:02] said that the Bible didn't say all right
[36:05] now 40 something years I've been
[36:06] studying it and I've never found it cuz
[36:10] you say well there's mistakes here
[36:12] there's this well you go ahead and do
[36:14] what you want to you'll find out one of
[36:16] these days who you're following right
[36:18] because you can't be following God and
[36:20] claiming to be a a messenger you know
[36:23] and all of the things that people say
[36:25] about him and all but that's all right
[36:27] that's up to them that's not me and you
[36:30] I'm not preaching to the world if
[36:31] anybody out there wants to hear it
[36:33] welcome to it but I'm not Pastor in the
[36:36] world I refuse to accept any
[36:39] responsibility for anybody outside of
[36:41] this little group of people all right
[36:43] cuz that's who I'm responsible for all
[36:46] right but now watch that in a little
[36:48] while as we begin to deal into the
[36:52] message now here's one thing I want you
[36:56] to think about
[36:59] the only way that we can get across what
[37:02] we're talking
[37:04] about is by
[37:07] words right I me it doesn't matter where
[37:10] you speak in Spanish English Chinese
[37:13] Japanese whatever you
[37:15] know it's it's still words right all
[37:19] right it may not sound like it to some
[37:21] of us but you know what they say is
[37:23] still words you know but see by looking
[37:28] then at even like a the
[37:31] Bible that we would find things that
[37:33] seem to be
[37:35] contrary right from this statement here
[37:39] to this statement over here you know it
[37:42] may sound contrary it may be uh you know
[37:45] sound totally off as I always like to
[37:48] say to you about it what about the
[37:49] Apostle Paul now no one in the Bible no
[37:53] Prophet or nothing never believed in
[37:54] nothing but one true and living God true
[37:57] but what about the Apostle Paul said the
[38:00] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[38:04] bless you
[38:05] all he had about six s you count them
[38:09] up but we know that's not
[38:12] right cuz there's only one true and
[38:14] living God but there's many
[38:17] manifestations of that God all right now
[38:20] that's what we want to deal with but we
[38:21] want to deal with things like what
[38:23] brother brandham would
[38:25] say brother brandham will say a lot of
[38:27] things things and there's a lot of
[38:28] people in Mass confusion because they
[38:31] find where he says this here and they
[38:33] find where he says this here and and
[38:36] they don't try to wait for God to put it
[38:39] together like I said I've studied on
[38:41] things for 20 30 this this message I'm
[38:43] on now on on one God for tonight I've
[38:47] been studying this over 40 something
[38:48] years
[38:50] amen because I saw many many years ago
[38:54] that people wouldn't seeing it and you
[38:56] remember about about 30 years ago I
[38:58] asked you the question I said when I say
[39:01] son of
[39:02] God what do you think of well everybody
[39:06] went back to 2,000 years ago on the
[39:09] shores of Galilee but see I said but
[39:13] that's even your theologians even your
[39:16] Scholars even your your writers knew
[39:19] better than that they they know that the
[39:21] first thing that come out from God was
[39:24] the word right which was the son of God
[39:28] then I said you're trying to figure it
[39:29] out and you're you're dealing with a
[39:31] human
[39:32] flesh you're not talking about what I'm
[39:35] talking about now tonight I keep making
[39:38] this
[39:39] statement when I I know how to say Jesus
[39:42] when I want to say Jesus talking about
[39:44] the flesh all right but when I'm saying
[39:48] Jesus Christ all this I am not
[39:51] necessarily referring to the flesh if I
[39:54] do I will tell you I'm referring to the
[39:57] flesh
[39:58] see but Jesus Christ is almighty
[40:01] God and we know the body that we call
[40:05] Jesus it had a beginning all right and
[40:09] it had to be made Eternal not that it
[40:11] was sinful or done anything wrong but it
[40:14] actually had to be redeemed there on the
[40:16] River Jordan where the prophet of God
[40:18] said this is my part of the earth that
[40:21] I've redeemed from this part of the
[40:22] earth I'll redeem the rest of it right
[40:25] see he placed it in order
[40:28] but it takes the Holy Ghost to be able
[40:30] to understand cuz the Holy Ghost is the
[40:32] only revealer of the word brother
[40:35] brandham can't reveal anything to you
[40:37] that's where people go wrong see they
[40:39] say brother brandham had the Revelation
[40:41] I got the Revelation well that's all
[40:43] right if it's revealed to you but Jesus
[40:46] brother brandom said Jesus said my own
[40:48] life did not reveal that unto thee the
[40:52] father is the only revealer of the word
[40:55] brother Dale and Bo nobody I don't care
[40:57] who they can't reveal anything to you we
[41:00] can only talk long enough to where that
[41:03] you can get the Revelation from God all
[41:06] right see then watch in a minute when we
[41:09] get to to what brother Ram is saying and
[41:12] it'll sound it sounds so odd until you
[41:15] say well there's no human way that can
[41:17] be you know but we'll see where it works
[41:20] out or Not Right But now remember the
[41:23] last message we preached we were talking
[41:26] about and we gave you a lot of quotes
[41:27] and I've got them laying here in front
[41:29] of me if you want them of where brother
[41:31] brandham says and tells you what the
[41:33] Bible is he said the Bible is the
[41:37] revelation of Jesus
[41:40] Christ now watch my point he didn't say
[41:43] that the revelation of God
[41:45] right CU God is an object of worship
[41:48] right he didn't say it was a revelation
[41:51] of Jesus you may find quotes like that
[41:53] but get the point of what I'm saying the
[41:56] Bible is the revelation of Jesus
[41:59] Christ all right so then let's don't
[42:01] start Jesus Christ 2,000 years
[42:05] ago let's go
[42:07] back see to where the prophet of God
[42:11] would bring it unto us and study it from
[42:14] what he's
[42:16] saying and then God can show it unto
[42:20] us see now number one on your notes look
[42:24] what your Prophet has to say about it
[42:26] Christ revealed excuse me who is this m
[42:30] ches the main point I want you to get is
[42:34] you read all this on all the whole
[42:36] quote and the people on internet have
[42:38] got the ability to pull it down and read
[42:40] it but look what he says notice this is
[42:43] in the
[42:45] beginning but before the Eternal that's
[42:50] right now do anybody want to explain
[42:55] that right that's not being
[42:58] sarcastic I'm just saying it right I'm
[43:00] saying it's only the prophet could say
[43:02] it that way see only Paul could say the
[43:06] God and father of our Lord Jesus
[43:09] Christ right and it not have reference
[43:11] to some form of
[43:14] trinitarianism you know or something so
[43:18] the prophet of God he says what in the
[43:20] beginning but before the
[43:24] Eternal so you see immediately that
[43:26] we're going to have to go
[43:27] way
[43:28] back into time and they uh bring the the
[43:32] board on up here and we'll just put it
[43:34] up I wasn't going to use it to right at
[43:35] the lights but we'll we'll put it up and
[43:38] and then maybe I can refer to things is
[43:40] everybody cool enough I turned the A on
[43:43] feels better it feels better I'm sure
[43:45] but turn the fan on is it running okay
[43:48] now cuz we don't want you to get
[43:49] uncomfortable and we don't want you to
[43:50] go to sleep I see you getting too bad of
[43:52] sleep y day okay let's stand up and
[43:54] holler high high high you know we'll do
[43:58] something that's a I don't want you to
[44:01] turn cart wheels but I want the wheels
[44:03] in the head turning okay so just bring
[44:06] it over here where the video camera to
[44:08] make sure and pick it up and uh then
[44:11] you'll see some of the things that we're
[44:13] going to do all right now while they're
[44:16] doing that I want you to think about the
[44:20] point we must use
[44:23] words that's right to describe what
[44:25] we're talking about
[44:27] right all right that's the only way we
[44:31] can communicate with one another I can't
[44:35] stand up here and say all right now
[44:37] brother Anderson I'm going to send you a
[44:39] message you get
[44:41] it now he didn't get it cuz I couldn't
[44:43] send
[44:45] it but you see by
[44:49] words by words I can send him a message
[44:54] now not on the telephone don't try I get
[44:56] him on my phone and I try keep trying to
[44:58] tell y'all don't send me them messages
[45:00] on my telephone cuz I don't know how to
[45:02] get back to you on it and if I did it
[45:05] take me a week to type it out so don't
[45:07] do it call me leave a message I'll get
[45:10] back with you but now
[45:13] listen we
[45:16] now we must depend
[45:20] upon the fact that we believe that
[45:23] brother brandham was a prophet right all
[45:27] right and then by believing that he was
[45:29] a prophet we believe that he was capable
[45:35] of doing what we cannot do which is
[45:38] we'll get to it a minute about going
[45:40] back in the back part of God's
[45:42] mind but yet he could do that and and
[45:46] then bring it down into
[45:48] words and then it would take many years
[45:51] why do you think we've been around here
[45:52] 40 something years since the prophet
[45:54] left
[45:58] is because that we have not got the
[46:00] Revelation exactly the way he was trying
[46:04] to preach it to
[46:06] us I mean that don't need interpreting
[46:09] does
[46:09] it we we I'm talking about me you all of
[46:14] us but you see a prophet of God seeing a
[46:19] self-existing Eternal
[46:22] God that would he would say and I gave
[46:25] you the quotes there where he says he
[46:27] covers all space fills all time runs
[46:30] into
[46:34] eternity now how can you explain that a
[46:38] God that covers all he he covers all
[46:42] space fills all time and runs in and it
[46:47] runs into eternity yes he's trying to
[46:50] get us to see the Eternal
[46:53] God all right now in doing that
[46:57] he was using
[46:59] words words that we can
[47:02] take and we can
[47:07] misinterpret we can
[47:10] mistranslate you know get our own
[47:15] thoughts
[47:16] and wind up in a
[47:20] mess or we can wait on the Holy Spirit
[47:23] to reveal
[47:25] it and see you know I'm just as honest
[47:28] as I can be because that's the way I am
[47:31] I wish you'd be that way with all of us
[47:34] but I wait until God reveals something
[47:37] to me that's why I haven't had to back
[47:40] up and retract a whole bunch of
[47:43] doctrinal issues that I brought out that
[47:45] wasn't
[47:46] right now of course when you say it that
[47:50] way people think you're being sarcastic
[47:52] or arrogant or think you know everything
[47:56] or whatever ever but uh I don't have to
[47:59] worry about it cuz it's the truth you
[48:01] can think what you want to about me but
[48:04] see I haven't got tied up in all these
[48:06] doctrines because when a Doctrine comes
[48:08] out I study
[48:10] it right I check into
[48:13] it but then I let the Holy Spirit show
[48:18] me whether it's right or
[48:20] not because there's never been a
[48:22] Doctrine yet that's not had some word
[48:24] basis to it at least some quotes some
[48:28] idea some thoughts you know or
[48:30] something but yet still now
[48:33] what so the prophet of God now is trying
[48:36] to explain to
[48:39] us how this great Eternal
[48:43] one could cover all
[48:46] space all
[48:48] time
[48:54] eternities and yet he's got to put it
[48:56] down into words yes that's right and by
[49:00] putting it into words you
[49:04] automatically seal something
[49:07] up now I get into my heart what God has
[49:10] revealed to me and I come here to the
[49:12] church and I try my best to explain to
[49:15] you what's in my heart that God has
[49:17] revealed to me yet I
[49:20] realize if that same God don't speak to
[49:23] you right then you're not going to see
[49:25] what I'm talking about right you'll know
[49:27] what I say intellectually you'll know
[49:30] that it is in the message you know like
[49:33] because you know I read so many quotes
[49:35] it's at least got to be somewhere in
[49:36] there but
[49:40] still by using
[49:42] words I must use words to explain now
[49:46] here's what most people here's where you
[49:47] going you going to get a bad one from
[49:49] people see I have to use words to
[49:51] explain what brother Brown is
[49:53] saying right now of course you know what
[49:56] people think about that it don't need to
[49:58] be
[49:59] explained Just Believe It Like It
[50:03] Is Well the Bible says that Judas went
[50:07] and hung himself and another scripture
[50:09] says you go do
[50:13] likewise see I think it does need to be
[50:17] understood your Prophet said I break it
[50:19] down in big nuggets and leave it for
[50:21] these ministers and all to break it down
[50:23] to the Ley right all right that's all
[50:25] I've ever tried to do
[50:27] I get the greatest honor in the world to
[50:29] stand there one day and just present one
[50:32] person to Christ that would be the
[50:34] greatest thing I could think of in just
[50:36] one person what about a
[50:39] church now but you see he's trying to
[50:44] explain an eternal
[50:47] God and putting it in
[50:50] words which
[50:54] automatically limits the ability of
[50:57] human mankind to
[51:01] comprehend because I I know how the
[51:03] human mind
[51:05] works you know I mean some of you
[51:08] sitting there already thinking well how
[51:11] long's he going to
[51:14] preach some are saying I we e sh up
[51:16] let's go get to singing cuz I want to
[51:19] sing you know hey come on I don't mind
[51:22] talking like that we just all human if I
[51:25] sitting there you know what be doing I
[51:27] probably having some him
[51:28] thoughts you CU see I'm honest I at
[51:31] least tell
[51:32] you cuz I see I know what the human mind
[51:34] does that's right brother yes God trying
[51:38] to reveal something to you what happens
[51:40] All Things Fall Apart don't
[51:44] they kids come running in babies come in
[51:47] and screaming phones are ringing
[51:50] everybody's a holler and and the Lord's
[51:53] trying to speak to you like I told you
[51:55] there the other night there the other
[51:57] day about it you know that walking
[51:58] around through Walmart right in the
[52:00] middle of of torment and walking around
[52:03] Walmart and God speaking to me and
[52:05] telling me to call Lisa and tell her
[52:07] that congratulations about the the baby
[52:10] that Matthew and them
[52:12] expected but you see you just got to
[52:15] wait and let him do what he's doing all
[52:17] right but now
[52:19] listen what about trying to explain a
[52:24] God that your prophet would say like
[52:28] number four on your notes
[52:31] that this eternal
[52:35] God dwelt
[52:40] Alone with his
[52:45] thoughts now if the human language means
[52:50] anything you know English whatever
[52:54] language you're in
[52:57] to say that God dwelt
[53:03] alone all
[53:05] right you know what that
[53:08] means do you know what that means that
[53:11] means God dwelt
[53:13] alone
[53:16] simple that means there was nobody
[53:20] there there was not anything with
[53:24] him now you read down through all these
[53:26] give you I'm going just try to hurry it
[53:27] up but you know and just quote the
[53:29] little Parts off of it and you'll find a
[53:31] prophet of God saying that was before
[53:33] there was any hour before there was any
[53:35] molecules before there was
[53:38] anything
[53:40] brother and he dwelt alone
[53:43] who the great self-existing
[53:47] Elohim and you know that Elohim is a
[53:49] word they used to try to explain
[53:53] God it is not a Bible word you know you
[53:56] don't find it written in the Bible do
[53:58] you you might find it in the original
[54:00] translation where it would come up to
[54:02] Elohim but you
[54:06] know but we don't think
[54:12] about what it
[54:14] is or either we go over too
[54:19] far and we think about him as dwelling
[54:24] alone and then there is some I'll get to
[54:26] it here in a few minutes
[54:28] but we think about him as being dwelling
[54:33] alone and we just making
[54:40] nothing you said no I'm making God but
[54:44] we better remember that God is an object
[54:45] of worship so you got to bring him down
[54:47] lower to where you can understand
[54:50] that can you comprehend
[54:56] an eternal almighty self-existing
[55:04] God that dwelt
[55:06] [Music]
[55:09] alone well that's the best way can do
[55:11] brother we just put him by S you know we
[55:13] we set up something and we say There It
[55:17] Is Well what was
[55:23] it it was God no you you word god means
[55:26] object of
[55:33] worship all
[55:35] right we see which well it was just a
[55:38] spirit we'll get that in a minute where
[55:40] the Prophet said he was a being
[55:45] amen now but what do we think about it
[55:49] see do we just making
[55:54] nothing I tell you what I
[55:58] believe I believe that Eternal
[56:02] God dwelt
[56:04] alone but I believe he was in a place
[56:07] and a position that was so much greater
[56:09] than what you and I are in until this is
[56:12] just a little thing little play parties
[56:15] on
[56:17] Earth I believe God is
[56:19] real well he's just a
[56:22] spirit see that's what we've been taught
[56:26] by mankind all the way down and you know
[56:29] God is a
[56:33] spirit but some of you fellas that used
[56:36] to
[56:38] drink you would see a pink
[56:42] elephant cuz you was drunk and it was
[56:45] more real than anything around you and
[56:47] you'd run into somebody getting away
[56:48] from the Pink Elephant
[56:51] yeah cuz it was real to you
[56:56] is your God real or what is
[57:00] he well he's just a
[57:06] spirit
[57:09] then what are
[57:11] you amen right I thought we were M In
[57:14] His Image but we get on down to those
[57:17] things God dwelt Alone with his thoughts
[57:21] the next one that's
[57:23] on uh who do you say this is
[57:27] the next one is does God change his mind
[57:29] about his word he said he dwelt
[57:33] alone but in him was
[57:36] attributes right
[57:41] right in him was
[57:45] attributes
[57:47] well I thought that the prophet said and
[57:51] it's in here
[57:53] somewhere that
[57:56] we were his attributes
[58:00] right well was we back there not like
[58:03] this no right not in human flesh now no
[58:07] don't get to that because he wasn't
[58:09] there in human flesh but it was so much
[58:11] higher than what this is until that's my
[58:15] point if you'll get what I'm talking
[58:17] about I believe God is real he's not
[58:20] just a that there is a Doctrine by
[58:23] denominational churches that says that
[58:25] God is just the the good thoughts you
[58:28] have and that Satan is just the bad
[58:30] thoughts you have you know and then one
[58:33] of them is a good spirit and the other
[58:34] one is a bad
[58:37] Spirit but you know your Prophet said
[58:39] Satan was
[58:42] real yes sir now if you look you'll find
[58:45] he said Satan is even a
[58:47] being that's how much real he
[58:50] is so we we're not going to get into him
[58:53] but see but look what is it mean
[58:56] self-existing
[58:59] what does self-existing mean to the
[59:01] human
[59:04] language you exist by
[59:08] yourself he said well you don't have to
[59:09] be so carnal with us tonight brother
[59:11] Dale but I'm not being carnal I'm just
[59:13] being
[59:15] true we say we we we take words to
[59:18] express what we're talking
[59:20] about and you know what we do then when
[59:22] somebody can't figure out what we're
[59:23] talking about it said you just can't
[59:25] understand it
[59:27] I agree with you reason I ask you a
[59:30] question I don't understand
[59:32] it but see that's what we do we use
[59:36] excuses well self-existing
[59:41] like I've always said I I don't
[59:43] understand it but I've always said it
[59:44] and I'm sorry to be carnal but you know
[59:48] they people can preachers don't even
[59:50] believe in what happened in the
[59:53] garden but yet Playboy magazine will
[59:57] show you what
[1:00:00] happened yeah brother down you mean you
[1:00:04] look at
[1:00:06] them yeah and you have
[1:00:09] too so don't
[1:00:11] Crow you might sneak around a little bit
[1:00:14] well ain't nobody
[1:00:15] looking I was going to preach on the
[1:00:17] pyramids one time that work I told you
[1:00:19] about I was going to preach on the
[1:00:21] pyramids of Egypt and this boy up there
[1:00:24] at work real good friend of mine Beck
[1:00:26] and uh he he he was a real good buddy
[1:00:29] and uh I told him what I was going to
[1:00:31] preach on he said well I got a Playboy
[1:00:33] magazine got that in
[1:00:35] it an article on it well man here I am
[1:00:39] sitting in a little office cubicle and
[1:00:41] the guy comes along looks over in
[1:00:44] there we CAU the preacher he's reading
[1:00:47] the Playboy
[1:00:48] magazine man that guy took him and
[1:00:52] wonder hurt him he grabbed him I'm
[1:00:54] talking about just bluy back
[1:00:56] he grabbed that boy and he shoved him
[1:00:58] against the wall and he bounced him off
[1:00:59] and he said I brought that preacher that
[1:01:02] Playboy magazine cuz he got an article
[1:01:04] in it about what he's going to preach
[1:01:06] on and Bud nobody didn't say nothing
[1:01:08] about the preacher with the Playboy
[1:01:10] magazine no
[1:01:12] more he said Well why'd you read it
[1:01:14] because there was a lot of good article
[1:01:15] in
[1:01:16] it I didn't have to go to the centerfold
[1:01:19] that's right come
[1:01:22] on it's just where I'm honest and
[1:01:24] straight
[1:01:27] but now listen self-existing one means
[1:01:30] he existed by
[1:01:32] himself there was nobody with him no
[1:01:35] people was with him no little identities
[1:01:37] running around in him like uh the
[1:01:39] Mormons believed that we were all up
[1:01:42] there with the father before the world
[1:01:45] and and then they we come down to earth
[1:01:47] to glorify our father and and that's why
[1:01:50] the two Soul people doing the same thing
[1:01:52] the message and all these little dots
[1:01:53] running around and
[1:01:56] that's right would you see if he was
[1:01:58] self-existing
[1:02:00] you know what that
[1:02:02] means that means that there was a
[1:02:06] time whatever you want to think about
[1:02:08] how wonderful you are there was a time
[1:02:11] you didn't exist
[1:02:15] right you can only exist in the thoughts
[1:02:18] of God
[1:02:20] right that's right but you know while
[1:02:23] you existed in the thoughts of God
[1:02:26] judas's
[1:02:27] carot existed in the thoughts of
[1:02:34] God all right see then self-existing
[1:02:38] this simply means he exists by
[1:02:41] himself and we can't be
[1:02:44] self-existent there's nothing in the
[1:02:46] world can be self-existing going down to
[1:02:49] to the Mighty God unveiled and you read
[1:02:54] down see in the beginning before the
[1:02:58] Eternal he was self-existing
[1:03:02] he was
[1:03:07] Elohim
[1:03:12] alone when you see the word Eternal and
[1:03:14] try to express what you
[1:03:20] see when you use the word Eternal right
[1:03:24] and you're trying to express that's what
[1:03:26] you
[1:03:28] see you see it of someone say God you
[1:03:31] know as being
[1:03:34] Eternal see then the word that you
[1:03:39] use come on folks just be plain language
[1:03:41] with me for a while all right this is
[1:03:44] the way I like to preach I like just be
[1:03:46] plain and that way you can't say that
[1:03:48] I'm trying to pull something over on you
[1:03:51] and I'm trying to tell you like it
[1:03:53] is we can thank God for it then
[1:03:58] then you know when you say Eternal
[1:04:00] brother dick you're making it something
[1:04:04] right you agree that's
[1:04:07] right yeah but now come on you still
[1:04:10] making it
[1:04:11] something when you say Eternal you're
[1:04:14] making it
[1:04:15] something you're making it the Eternal
[1:04:17] God yes cuz there only one Eternal God
[1:04:21] right but you still made it something
[1:04:25] no no no I didn't make it nothing I just
[1:04:27] said what it was you're not listening to
[1:04:29] what I'm saying when you say Eternal
[1:04:32] you're making it something what you're
[1:04:35] making it Eternal right and that's the
[1:04:37] only word you can use cuz you wasn't
[1:04:39] backu to have any other word to use it
[1:04:43] with we try to express
[1:04:46] eternity as
[1:04:48] like having no beginning and having no
[1:04:50] ending
[1:04:53] right now you just made it something
[1:04:58] right you said what's this important if
[1:05:00] we don't see how the Bible's written we
[1:05:02] can't understand what happened before
[1:05:03] the world come on I'm trying to lay down
[1:05:06] something okay that's
[1:05:09] right when you say
[1:05:12] Eternal and you say that's the Living
[1:05:15] God you just made him something what you
[1:05:19] just made him
[1:05:20] Eternal now accept that
[1:05:25] when you say self-existing you just made
[1:05:28] him self-existing because you're denying
[1:05:31] all other things of existence that's
[1:05:36] right and settling it down to where it
[1:05:39] is self
[1:05:42] existing existing
[1:05:44] [Music]
[1:05:46] alone when you say it's like a
[1:05:52] ring meaning it has no starting point
[1:05:56] right and no ending
[1:05:58] point but you've made it
[1:06:04] something you by your words made it
[1:06:08] something are you understanding me yes
[1:06:12] when you say Eternal you made it
[1:06:14] something AB when you say no beginning
[1:06:17] and no ending you made it something now
[1:06:20] don't back off that after a while when I
[1:06:22] get down to what I'm saying yes yes cuz
[1:06:25] you
[1:06:26] backpedaling now that wasn't what I
[1:06:28] meant well don't
[1:06:32] backpedal just stay with
[1:06:36] me when we
[1:06:38] say that he dwelt
[1:06:41] alone that
[1:06:44] means now what other word can you use it
[1:06:47] means there was a time cuz that's all we
[1:06:49] know to use time Etc a position a place
[1:06:53] or something that dwelt
[1:06:59] alone God dwelt
[1:07:03] alone all right quit trying to make us
[1:07:05] back up there
[1:07:08] then make us in his thoughts and make us
[1:07:11] attributes and things like that that's
[1:07:13] fine but don't make us
[1:07:17] people but at the same time
[1:07:19] now don't make him as a non-existent
[1:07:23] something that you can't put a l
[1:07:27] on now you know what I mean by that you
[1:07:31] put a label on eternity you put a label
[1:07:33] on no beginning and no ending you put a
[1:07:36] label on a circle going all the way
[1:07:38] around and have no beginning on it but
[1:07:41] then are you going to let your God go
[1:07:44] clean out of
[1:07:48] existence cuz just
[1:07:50] remember whether you like to think it or
[1:07:52] not we had to come from God
[1:07:58] you everybody in the world had
[1:08:02] to we know the
[1:08:04] story even the word God is not used
[1:08:07] because the word God in Genesis 1 where
[1:08:11] it says God created the Heaven and the
[1:08:12] Earth the word God could not be there as
[1:08:16] that form of that word until he created
[1:08:21] something to worship him that's right
[1:08:23] and that was the Angels now the quotes
[1:08:25] are in it's okay the Angels worshiped
[1:08:28] him and that made him
[1:08:31] God you know where that was at in
[1:08:38] eternity he created angels in
[1:08:42] eternity now I didn't say see there's
[1:08:46] your words I didn't say he created
[1:08:48] Eternal angels I didn't say that cuz
[1:08:51] that won't
[1:08:53] work cuz there something them Angels
[1:08:57] fail and they won't be
[1:09:00] Eternal so you see words trap
[1:09:06] you but what else can you
[1:09:12] use see by by saying that
[1:09:16] God is
[1:09:18] eternal we make a
[1:09:22] beginning no no no we don't make it come
[1:09:24] on now you you ain't getting
[1:09:27] it you're saying that there was a time
[1:09:31] or a position or something that we never
[1:09:35] existed whatsoever in that God dwelt
[1:09:38] totally alone that's
[1:09:41] right but as I said and I don't think
[1:09:43] about him as a glob floating around
[1:09:45] through the heavens wondering what's
[1:09:46] going on well I don't know what I'm on
[1:09:48] to do I just I'm just a spirit and I'm
[1:09:50] just that world there is more real than
[1:09:53] anything we've ever thought of eternal
[1:09:56] life you have in your soul is just a
[1:09:58] touch of that eternity that is
[1:10:03] D where did your God come from ohk
[1:10:08] God you know where the Bible tells you
[1:10:10] he come
[1:10:11] from he come from teon didn't he that's
[1:10:14] what the Bible says that's right you
[1:10:16] ever notice your Bible said God come
[1:10:18] from teon right you know what teon means
[1:10:20] right
[1:10:21] hand yes
[1:10:23] he he is right
[1:10:26] hand that's why it says
[1:10:32] ton see we come up to Genesis
[1:10:35] 1 and in Genesis 1 we use the word
[1:10:39] God right
[1:10:41] now you got to
[1:10:44] listen
[1:10:46] see that word was
[1:10:49] translated from the word Elohim cuz your
[1:10:52] Prophet said it
[1:10:54] now in Genesis 1 it was
[1:10:57] Elohim am and he even puts it over where
[1:11:00] you get into John 1 uh the unveiling of
[1:11:03] God or Mighty God unveil one of the two
[1:11:06] I think is unveiling of God he said in
[1:11:08] the beginning was Elohim and Elohim was
[1:11:12] with Elohim and Elohim was Elohim and
[1:11:15] Elohim verse 14 says was made
[1:11:18] flesh that's he's trying to show you one
[1:11:21] true and living God
[1:11:25] that word was translated down from
[1:11:28] Elohim and it wasn't used in our English
[1:11:31] language of Elohim because the Angels
[1:11:34] had already worshiped him bringing him
[1:11:37] into the order of God but the word God
[1:11:40] in Genesis 1 is
[1:11:43] Elohim that's right you better hang on
[1:11:47] because 126 and 27 you better not run
[1:11:50] around with a
[1:11:52] trinity come on we're not over there
[1:11:55] that's
[1:11:56] right but before Genesis 1:1 there is no
[1:12:00] way or
[1:12:02] anything that you and
[1:12:05] I can be able to comprehend
[1:12:11] God that's why we got to depend upon the
[1:12:13] prophet amen
[1:12:16] right and his ability to go before God
[1:12:19] and God to speak to him because there is
[1:12:21] no writing before Genesis 1:1
[1:12:26] no matter what you can take the
[1:12:27] theologians and what they're doing is
[1:12:29] just translating those words that's
[1:12:32] right they're translating those words
[1:12:35] that are written down that's
[1:12:38] right there is nothing no way to
[1:12:40] comprehend anything before Genesis 1:1
[1:12:44] without the prophet of God to be able to
[1:12:47] bring us the
[1:12:48] message so our total dependence upon him
[1:12:52] all right
[1:12:55] [Music]
[1:12:58] now but we can
[1:13:00] look at the
[1:13:02] creation in Genesis
[1:13:05] 1 and we can begin to see the
[1:13:12] Creator
[1:13:14] right
[1:13:17] now in Genesis 1 the creation of all
[1:13:20] things you know the Earth the moon the
[1:13:22] stars etc
[1:13:23] etc if if you'll take that and read it
[1:13:26] sometimes and really get in the spirit
[1:13:28] of God you'll see that Genesis 1 is God
[1:13:30] trying to explain himself to
[1:13:36] man cuz it winds up showing you that he
[1:13:39] finally created Something In His
[1:13:41] Image he made the animals he made the
[1:13:43] trees he made the Stars he made this he
[1:13:45] done made Angels he' done all this he
[1:13:47] done the angels and everything like that
[1:13:49] was created in eternity
[1:13:52] yes but the world in Genesis 1 there was
[1:13:55] no now listen listen and you see over
[1:13:59] here the
[1:14:01] creation time not
[1:14:04] counted you what what it was it was
[1:14:06] seven
[1:14:08] days
[1:14:09] no time hadn't begun at that
[1:14:13] time he said what kind of a state was it
[1:14:16] in well let me quote brother brandham he
[1:14:17] said Adam in the garden
[1:14:19] was his youth was being renewed
[1:14:26] right so that's what I said we got a
[1:14:29] prophet to go
[1:14:30] with if we just get away from our
[1:14:33] ideas see Genesis 1 is a creation but
[1:14:37] God didn't start keeping up with time
[1:14:39] until the fall
[1:14:41] came even though there is the days but
[1:14:44] how long is that
[1:14:47] day oh now we got to profit
[1:14:52] in't we say oh that just 24 hours
[1:14:57] now according to the
[1:14:59] Bible a thousand years is a day and a
[1:15:02] day is a th000 years in God so that
[1:15:06] could have been 7,000
[1:15:09] years get the point what I'm
[1:15:12] saying time wouldn't be
[1:15:15] uncredited there was no need of keeping
[1:15:17] up with it you think you're going to
[1:15:19] have a calendar in eternity and you
[1:15:20] going to be like you're in jail you know
[1:15:22] have to do in jail you know they mark
[1:15:23] off the days that day done
[1:15:25] and that day is done and that day is
[1:15:27] done you
[1:15:29] no you think in eternity we're going to
[1:15:31] have a
[1:15:33] [Music]
[1:15:35] calendar but yet there will be days and
[1:15:39] nights right but I thought we believed
[1:15:43] everything would finally want it to be
[1:15:48] Eternal so using words
[1:15:55] but
[1:15:57] listen God cannot change his way now I
[1:16:01] wrote myself a little note here stick on
[1:16:02] there where explain before you can
[1:16:06] understand an eternal Elohim you're
[1:16:08] going to have to get into the
[1:16:14] Bible you're going to have to get in the
[1:16:16] written part right
[1:16:19] am if not what are you going to put it
[1:16:22] on how you going to prove it's right
[1:16:24] that's right how do you going to know
[1:16:27] it's right your idea is good as mine
[1:16:29] mine's good as
[1:16:34] yours so that's what I'm saying let's
[1:16:36] come down to Genesis
[1:16:41] 1 and let's look at Genesis
[1:16:45] 1 let's see how the Bible was written
[1:16:47] you remember W did the other
[1:16:50] night the other Wednesday night he was
[1:16:52] covering Genesis 1 and Revelations 1 you
[1:16:55] remember
[1:16:56] [Music]
[1:16:58] that to those that wouldn't hear will
[1:17:00] Express a little bit about
[1:17:03] it if God ever does anything one time he
[1:17:08] must always do it the
[1:17:10] same we talk about healing saving Etc
[1:17:14] but remember if he wrote his Bible one
[1:17:19] time he ever wrote one book anywhere
[1:17:22] he's got to write every one of the books
[1:17:24] in our sign
[1:17:26] right now how was that
[1:17:29] written well just prophet
[1:17:32] got where did Moses
[1:17:35] get the ability to write five
[1:17:38] books and to tell us what happened in
[1:17:41] the garden and the creation right a you
[1:17:44] just sat down one day and thought about
[1:17:46] it well you sure got a poor imagination
[1:17:49] about God in his
[1:17:52] ways but you see that's what I've been
[1:17:54] trying to get you to see reason reason
[1:17:56] we've been reading in Revelations 1
[1:17:58] because Revelations 1 shows you or to me
[1:18:00] it does to me anyway shows me exactly
[1:18:02] how the Bible is
[1:18:04] written then I can go back to Genesis
[1:18:06] and start in Genesis 1 by the way of the
[1:18:09] Prophet right and see how it is
[1:18:12] written then I'll see who he is
[1:18:16] right all right so what is it in
[1:18:20] Revelations 1 what do you see the
[1:18:23] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:18:25] Christ which God gave unto
[1:18:31] him boy you're trinitarian that's two
[1:18:34] Gods no we showed it there in the last
[1:18:37] message
[1:18:39] that Jesus didn't even know his part in
[1:18:41] the Kingdom right they asked him about
[1:18:44] it when was he coming he didn't know
[1:18:47] your Prophet said page about 14 in there
[1:18:49] the church age book right in
[1:18:51] there he said
[1:18:55] it hadn't been made
[1:18:58] known but but I thought he was
[1:19:02] God well let's solve that
[1:19:05] problem do you have the new birth
[1:19:11] am
[1:19:12] okay do you know
[1:19:15] everything what's the
[1:19:17] problem right it Ain been revealed to me
[1:19:21] thank you
[1:19:27] even brother random said there was times
[1:19:29] that Jesus
[1:19:31] Remember he'd say according to your
[1:19:35] faith be it unto you that's right he
[1:19:38] said because the father had not reveal
[1:19:41] to him that they were healed but said
[1:19:45] when Lazarus come said he'd already seen
[1:19:48] a vision and he said I do nothing until
[1:19:51] the father shows me and he went kept on
[1:19:54] going instead of coming
[1:19:58] back until finally he came and raised
[1:20:01] him that's right the
[1:20:05] words don't get lost in words let words
[1:20:08] be the ability to understand Genesis or
[1:20:12] Revelations 1 we see the revelation God
[1:20:15] gave to Jesus to give to John John was
[1:20:18] the writer the angel was the one who
[1:20:22] transmitted it down to John to be able
[1:20:25] to tell him right
[1:20:29] now so how did God write Genesis one
[1:20:33] we're in Genesis 1 where it says God
[1:20:36] created the heavens and the
[1:20:39] Earth can you see that's the
[1:20:45] sign because now you're going to have to
[1:20:47] listen to the words now listen to the
[1:20:49] words and I'll Express them later but
[1:20:50] listen to the words
[1:20:52] okay Revelations 1 it says the
[1:20:54] revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[1:20:57] gave unto
[1:21:01] him Genesis one says the revelation of
[1:21:05] Jesus Christ that God gave unto him
[1:21:08] right
[1:21:12] amen amen he don't say
[1:21:16] that will you tell me why I don't say
[1:21:19] that
[1:21:25] you see that's where we're getting tied
[1:21:26] up at that's right we're not looking at
[1:21:31] God in the way he done
[1:21:34] things you know that God the Father
[1:21:37] we'll call him out a way where we won't
[1:21:38] be using the word God for object of
[1:21:40] worship you know the father never
[1:21:42] created a
[1:21:44] thing according to the Bible according
[1:21:47] to John 1's Colossians 1 Hebrews 1 James
[1:21:51] 3 and9 is that what it is
[1:21:55] Jesus Christ created all
[1:21:57] things that's why when Peter stood there
[1:21:59] and Jesus said who do Man say I the son
[1:22:01] of man am he said Thou Art the
[1:22:06] Christ the son of the Living God go over
[1:22:09] the Book of Luke I believe is the other
[1:22:10] one where it says Thou Art the Christ of
[1:22:13] God is
[1:22:15] what Peter was
[1:22:17] saying you're the
[1:22:20] Creator now then we're coming down to a
[1:22:23] son
[1:22:32] wow but the father never created
[1:22:38] anything
[1:22:40] okay so in Genesis 1 you see the
[1:22:45] Revelation that God wanted to reveal
[1:22:49] himself to man amen you agree with that
[1:22:53] amen you agree with Genesis 1 being God
[1:22:56] wantan to reveal himself to man okay so
[1:22:59] wouldn't that be the Revelation that God
[1:23:01] give to Jesus to give to John
[1:23:04] amen hang on a minute we're going a
[1:23:06] little further
[1:23:09] right because in
[1:23:12] Genesis in Revelations 1 Let's well
[1:23:15] let's swap it this way Genesis 1 says
[1:23:19] the revelation of what God gave to Jesus
[1:23:23] Christ to make known
[1:23:26] right well does the scripture say sent
[1:23:28] and signified by his
[1:23:31] son come on are we in the
[1:23:34] Bible revelations 1 says a revelation
[1:23:37] that God give to Jesus Christ to make
[1:23:40] that
[1:23:40] known like Wade was bringing out Genesis
[1:23:43] 1 God made a spiritual
[1:23:46] man 126 and 27 which was
[1:23:50] Christ you
[1:23:52] agree mhm
[1:23:57] how about in Revelations 1 where God
[1:24:00] showed that spiritual man standing in
[1:24:03] the midst of seven golden candlesticks
[1:24:05] like unto the son of man G about the PS
[1:24:07] with a golden girdle which is
[1:24:09] femin he showed him that spiritual
[1:24:14] man you see what I'm
[1:24:17] saying just follow with me a little bit
[1:24:20] and then it'll
[1:24:21] click see the spiritual Man was created
[1:24:25] in Genesis 1 that's right the spiritual
[1:24:28] man was revealed or shown in Revelations
[1:24:36] 1 Genesis
[1:24:39] 2 God made a natural Man Out of the Dust
[1:24:43] of the earth and put the spiritual man
[1:24:46] in the natural man you agree that's
[1:24:50] right Revelations 2 shows you that we
[1:24:55] start the church Ages were that the
[1:24:58] Genesis one man was put into Genesis
[1:25:02] 2 now it's the spiritual man by the
[1:25:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost put into to
[1:25:07] the bride of Christ down through seven
[1:25:09] Church ages now you see what timeing
[1:25:13] together it'll all line up now if you
[1:25:15] watch it so we're not true there we got
[1:25:17] a lot more to
[1:25:18] go Genesis 3 you see that 3 and 15 says
[1:25:23] I'll put
[1:25:25] enmity between thy seed and the seed of
[1:25:27] the
[1:25:29] woman Revelations three tells you in
[1:25:32] 3:14 who that beginning of the creation
[1:25:35] of God is which is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:25:38] The Promised one that was promised to be
[1:25:41] the seed of the
[1:25:42] woman so it's lining
[1:25:48] up we can look at the Book of
[1:25:49] Revelations and see how Genesis was
[1:25:51] written right
[1:26:00] okay in Genesis
[1:26:07] 1 you see the
[1:26:20] Creator the word Elohim your Prophet
[1:26:23] says in Genesis 1 was the creator it was
[1:26:27] the logos it was the word it was the son
[1:26:30] of God it was the
[1:26:32] theophany that's Genesis
[1:26:40] 1 Genesis Revelations 1 shows you that
[1:26:44] God in his bride amen standing in the
[1:26:47] midst of the seven golden
[1:26:50] Candlestick now I've got it written like
[1:26:52] this all right come on told you it's
[1:26:54] going to be a long time we do it pretty
[1:26:56] good we're
[1:26:58] 9:30 I will try to explain more in a
[1:27:01] moment of why I said that in Genesis 1
[1:27:05] it's the revelation of Jesus
[1:27:08] Christ that was given to right right am
[1:27:11] I'll explain that better in just a
[1:27:14] moment but listen
[1:27:19] now
[1:27:22] in Revelation
[1:27:25] 1 God gave the Revelation unto Jesus
[1:27:30] Christ about
[1:27:33] himself something about himself that he
[1:27:37] didn't previously
[1:27:39] know you see yeah but he was God brother
[1:27:44] Dale
[1:27:50] amen let me ask you a simple question
[1:27:56] and I know immediately the answer if I
[1:27:57] say Do you believe God knows everything
[1:28:00] you'll say yes he does well he don't
[1:28:02] know about them sins that I just
[1:28:04] repented
[1:28:08] of you
[1:28:12] agree it's wonderful when you know what
[1:28:14] you're talking
[1:28:18] about you got to see him as being able
[1:28:20] to forget
[1:28:25] you say God can't well you explain it
[1:28:27] then because if you don't believe it
[1:28:29] that way you still got your
[1:28:31] sins you don't know how they're
[1:28:34] gone I told you one of these days want
[1:28:36] to preach on God with amnesia cuz he
[1:28:38] forgets everything I do as long as I
[1:28:40] repent and I loved it so much when I
[1:28:42] heard that that what brother Brenham
[1:28:44] said about it he said if a person comes
[1:28:46] before me and he said if they've
[1:28:49] repented of their sins he said I cannot
[1:28:53] that's right go back in their life and
[1:28:54] bring up that that they've repented
[1:28:57] of that's how great God is I love him
[1:29:01] Church you think I'm playing or showing
[1:29:04] trying to show how smart I am 40
[1:29:06] something
[1:29:10] years so we see in Revelations 1 that
[1:29:14] God gave the Revelation that Jesus
[1:29:15] Christ to give to
[1:29:17] John John was the one that was to write
[1:29:19] it down the angel didn't write it the
[1:29:22] angel was the one to
[1:29:26] deliver watch that Genesis 1 then we see
[1:29:31] in Genesis one that God gave the
[1:29:35] Revelation to his son Jesus Christ to
[1:29:39] give unto
[1:29:42] mankind you say a son that's a
[1:29:44] trinitarian that we don't believe in
[1:29:45] Eternal sunship
[1:29:47] okay Elohim
[1:29:54] he done
[1:29:57] something to bring it and do
[1:30:01] it so you want me to say it this way or
[1:30:03] which way you want me to bring
[1:30:06] it in Revelations 1 excuse me Genesis
[1:30:10] one he sent and signified it by his
[1:30:15] Angel to give to the prophet Moses
[1:30:22] amen amen
[1:30:26] you
[1:30:27] say you catching on
[1:30:30] am who wrote
[1:30:34] Genesis who wrote
[1:30:37] Genesis how did Moses know what happened
[1:30:40] in
[1:30:44] Genesis he sent and signified his
[1:30:48] Angel gave it to his Prophet Moses to
[1:30:50] write it down that's Exodus 3
[1:30:56] amen and there's some quotes we're
[1:30:58] fixing to get to that's the burning bush
[1:31:06] experience Exodus
[1:31:09] 3 remember it was an angel that came to
[1:31:13] Moses at the burning
[1:31:18] bush you agree
[1:31:22] am and that angel was almighty God
[1:31:25] wouldn't it
[1:31:27] amen God spoke to Moses from The Burning
[1:31:30] Bush you agree
[1:31:31] [Music]
[1:31:35] amen see you had to have an angel to
[1:31:38] deliver it
[1:31:41] by right now are you with me look at
[1:31:45] number 11 on your
[1:31:51] notes who was that in the burning
[1:31:59] bush expectation
[1:32:02] 1951 and I know and any scholar knows
[1:32:05] that that
[1:32:06] angel was the angel of the
[1:32:10] Covenant was that right which was Christ
[1:32:14] that's true it met Moses in the burning
[1:32:18] bush it was the pillar of fire not Moses
[1:32:23] done the work
[1:32:25] now
[1:32:27] then so Revelations 1 is
[1:32:30] right it's a revelation that God gave to
[1:32:33] Jesus to give to
[1:32:39] John he gave it to his son to give it to
[1:32:46] John at the burning
[1:32:50] bush God speaks to Moses the angel of
[1:32:53] the the
[1:32:56] Covenant
[1:33:00] amen and who's
[1:33:06] he here's the angel of the Covenant
[1:33:09] right right
[1:33:13] am which is Christ
[1:33:19] amen okay
[1:33:25] for some reason I left off number 12 at
[1:33:27] the title of what it was but it may be a
[1:33:29] continuation of expectation I'm not no
[1:33:32] it's not a continuation but may be the
[1:33:33] same book we don't worry about we don't
[1:33:36] need that one but brother R said it was
[1:33:38] the angel of the
[1:33:40] Covenant plenty more of
[1:33:45] them let's see how Moses wrote the
[1:33:50] Bible number 13 on your notes
[1:33:54] we would see Jesus gra Valley California
[1:33:56] in 1962
[1:33:57] 704 Moses wrote five books of the Old
[1:34:01] Testament Exodus and Genesis and Exodus
[1:34:04] Leviticus Deuteronomy
[1:34:07] numbers he wrote the five books of the
[1:34:10] Old Testament ire by
[1:34:14] inspiration from
[1:34:17] God he wrote and told what it was then
[1:34:20] he wrote and told what would be
[1:34:24] who from that angel of the Covenant if
[1:34:26] you need any more on that about the
[1:34:28] angel of the Covenant call me there's
[1:34:29] plenty more I just just run in your
[1:34:31] computer Angel of the Covenant see I've
[1:34:34] got stacks on my desk and I just what am
[1:34:37] I going to do with
[1:34:38] them told way the other day I said I've
[1:34:41] cut out two hours on one
[1:34:44] thing you already know by now that's
[1:34:46] about
[1:34:50] truth but he got it by inspiration am
[1:34:54] see Moses didn't have anything to read
[1:35:00] from right the only possibility Moses
[1:35:03] had of any reading would have been the
[1:35:05] the book of of uh who is
[1:35:08] it job job because it was written for
[1:35:12] Genesis but I'm just trying to get a
[1:35:14] point to
[1:35:18] you God spoke to Moses through an
[1:35:22] angel at the burning
[1:35:25] bush told him to go to Egypt and take
[1:35:29] over that same Angel guided him he said
[1:35:32] my angel will go before you but said you
[1:35:35] better be careful cuz my name is in him
[1:35:37] read it in Exodus
[1:35:39] there he said my name is in him read
[1:35:42] Exodus
[1:35:44] 3 cuz that was the Lord Jesus
[1:35:48] Christ now you understand I didn't say
[1:35:51] Jesus I've got enough sense I said the
[1:35:54] Lord Jesus
[1:35:56] Christ the angel of the Covenant the
[1:35:59] Loos the theophany the
[1:36:03] word that created all
[1:36:05] things communion 19651 1212 do show you
[1:36:10] just as Moses went into the Wilderness
[1:36:12] to receive the inspiration to write the
[1:36:14] five books the first five books of the
[1:36:16] Bible Paul went to the desert Etc and
[1:36:19] you know where he
[1:36:22] went now to just show you how tricky
[1:36:24] words can be there is two quotes that
[1:36:27] brother brandham says that Moses only
[1:36:29] wrote four
[1:36:31] books I don't mind saying
[1:36:35] that well that's contradiction cuz one
[1:36:38] of you wrote four and another wrote five
[1:36:43] no and ain't no misunderstanding is it
[1:36:47] he wrote four
[1:36:54] what's the problem with thinking he wrot
[1:36:57] five that's my brother he's a messages
[1:36:59] preacher he said how could Moses tell
[1:37:01] about his own death over in in
[1:37:03] Deuteronomy you
[1:37:05] know and I said if you'll explain one
[1:37:07] thing to me you tell me how Moses know
[1:37:09] what happened in the garden right and we
[1:37:12] won't have no problems right with
[1:37:14] knowing how he could write about his own
[1:37:15] death right that's no
[1:37:17] trouble I just say that just where
[1:37:20] people see people what they do with you
[1:37:22] they they call me a smart elic because
[1:37:24] of the statements and the way I make and
[1:37:26] then I'll come up and say he didn't
[1:37:28] catch
[1:37:29] out I found where he said he just four
[1:37:32] books well he did he wrote four books he
[1:37:35] wrote five books no
[1:37:38] problem all
[1:37:42] right Christ being the angel of the
[1:37:48] Covenant the logos the theophany the
[1:37:51] word that's who comes to
[1:37:54] Moses if you want a better understanding
[1:37:57] of it I'll get it in memory in a minute
[1:37:59] but maybe somebody else can help me is I
[1:38:01] think it's unveiling of God but brother
[1:38:03] brand was talking about the Ten
[1:38:04] Commandments and he said when the seals
[1:38:06] came he calls the Ten Commandments the
[1:38:09] seals abely amen now I can take the seal
[1:38:12] just by my own understanding of what the
[1:38:14] prophet has said that where I can go and
[1:38:16] I can go back through Genesis and show
[1:38:17] you every bit of it marriage and divorce
[1:38:19] and everything right into those seals
[1:38:22] cuz your Prophet said one seal tie the
[1:38:24] endre Bible
[1:38:26] together that's not bragging that's
[1:38:30] fact I'm trying to get you to see
[1:38:32] something to where that I can say what I
[1:38:33] want to
[1:38:35] say Moses
[1:38:39] wrote the first five books by
[1:38:42] inspiration because he had no one to
[1:38:44] read
[1:38:45] from so we had personal
[1:38:50] contact with almighty God at the burning
[1:38:52] bush
[1:38:55] oh so wonderful how long could we
[1:38:57] preach Moses turns around and he says
[1:39:01] Lord I've seen you face to face the
[1:39:05] Bible says
[1:39:06] that and it ain't it's still in the same
[1:39:09] chapter or either the next one one he
[1:39:11] turns around and he said Lord I want to
[1:39:13] see
[1:39:15] you he said you can't see
[1:39:18] me something Lord I'd love to see you
[1:39:20] done seen him face to face talk to him
[1:39:22] lip to ear mouth to mouth as your
[1:39:24] Prophet would
[1:39:25] say and he turns around he says go stick
[1:39:28] your head in that Cliff of the rock what
[1:39:29] was the Cliff of the rock where he
[1:39:31] brought the water out the rock which was
[1:39:33] Christ go turn into Christ tonight and
[1:39:35] you'll see what I'm talking about Turn
[1:39:38] Your Head to Christ and get out of your
[1:39:39] own ideas pray for a
[1:39:43] revelation you will see
[1:39:46] Christ and see what he's doing brother R
[1:39:49] said outside of the Corporal body
[1:39:50] there's no difference in what it is
[1:39:53] thank he because he's
[1:39:56] here but
[1:40:01] listen then it gets confusing because a
[1:40:04] prophet would make these
[1:40:06] statements and he'd say Moses at the
[1:40:09] Burning Bush was speaking to the
[1:40:13] lost the Son of
[1:40:16] God number 15 on your notes look at
[1:40:20] it Moses speaking
[1:40:24] the angel of God that went before
[1:40:27] Moses which we
[1:40:31] know that the angel that led Moses was
[1:40:34] the angel of the Covenant which was
[1:40:36] Christ the son of God and the are the
[1:40:39] logos that went out of God was the son
[1:40:42] of
[1:40:44] God that's
[1:40:47] right he said well you just keep saying
[1:40:49] Son of
[1:40:51] God well I'll take it off right now now
[1:40:53] but I won't speak much on it there's
[1:40:57] only one true and living
[1:41:00] God a Son of God is God in another form
[1:41:03] called a son right not another person
[1:41:08] that's where people miss it say all
[1:41:10] right I want to hold that look at the
[1:41:12] next one number 16 the logos that went
[1:41:15] out of God was the son of God it was the
[1:41:16] only visible form that this Spirit had
[1:41:19] and it was a theophany which means a
[1:41:21] body and and the body was like a man
[1:41:24] Moses saw it passed Moses saw it when it
[1:41:27] passed through by The Rock right going
[1:41:31] down him and the theophany which was a
[1:41:32] Son of God that son that Loos became
[1:41:35] flesh because we were put in flesh and
[1:41:38] the theophany the Loos became flesh here
[1:41:40] among us and it was nothing else but the
[1:41:42] dwelling place for that Eternal fountain
[1:41:45] dwelt in him oh do you see it that was
[1:41:49] one are you catching on
[1:41:56] then truly it is the
[1:41:59] revelation of Jesus
[1:42:05] Christ it's not a revelation of Jesus by
[1:42:11] himself not a revelation to just say
[1:42:13] well the Revelation just about God
[1:42:23] you know that Jesus never come to reveal
[1:42:26] [Music]
[1:42:31] himself anybody that thinks they're a
[1:42:33] Son of God a preacher or whoever it is
[1:42:36] and they think you're trying to reveal
[1:42:37] yourself to the people you got a garbage
[1:42:39] can you better wake up cuz Jesus was not
[1:42:44] trying to reveal
[1:42:49] himself read your Bible Matthew 11 25-
[1:42:54] 27 it says the son revealing he to whom
[1:42:57] the son will
[1:43:01] revealing Jesus Christ brother around
[1:43:03] said did not come to reveal himself or
[1:43:06] make himself known he said he come to
[1:43:08] reveal the father that's what I was
[1:43:09] talking about there the other
[1:43:12] night it's past Wednesday
[1:43:15] night see we take adoption and we saw oh
[1:43:17] adoption is is the father leaving and
[1:43:20] the son coming up boy look at us well
[1:43:22] look what we are we we're something
[1:43:24] we're the Sons and Daughters of
[1:43:26] God
[1:43:29] no adoption is when the son goes off the
[1:43:32] scene and the father comes on cuz I
[1:43:35] thought we supposed to take on his
[1:43:37] nature right yes
[1:43:39] sir you say well brother
[1:43:42] Dale you you you don't believe in
[1:43:44] manifested sons of God that's where
[1:43:46] you're mixed up in your cranium
[1:43:51] cap CU I believe in more than you ever
[1:43:53] thought about in your life because I've
[1:43:55] been preaching it for 40
[1:43:57] years the word manifest is to make
[1:44:01] known right so you think it's signs and
[1:44:04] wonders and healings and things you
[1:44:06] can't do that let's see you do it now
[1:44:08] that's that's just plain you can't do it
[1:44:11] I can't do
[1:44:12] it Jesus couldn't do it he couldn't heal
[1:44:16] nobody
[1:44:20] right oh I just see that you you know go
[1:44:25] ahead he said I do nothing till the
[1:44:27] father shows me that's
[1:44:29] right the father is the
[1:44:32] Healer the son is just the deliverer
[1:44:35] right but you say well I thought you
[1:44:38] said it was a revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:44:39] it is the revelation of Jesus Christ is
[1:44:41] a revelation of almighty
[1:44:44] God he to whom the son will
[1:44:49] reveal Jesus didn't come to reveal
[1:44:52] himself he come to to reveal his
[1:44:55] father it's my father the one I'm
[1:44:57] talking
[1:45:00] about because why
[1:45:03] manifest what is it Romans 8 the days of
[1:45:06] the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:45:09] everybody thinks that's we got to go out
[1:45:10] in empty hospitals we got to go out and
[1:45:12] we got to do all these
[1:45:14] things no we got to make him known folks
[1:45:18] that's all I've done for 40 years is
[1:45:20] tried to make God known
[1:45:23] and for 40 years he's made me known
[1:45:25] enough that I don't have to worry about
[1:45:26] it
[1:45:28] amen I don't argue with
[1:45:32] nobody I've seen him manifest
[1:45:35] himself I've seen him raise the
[1:45:39] dead what do I
[1:45:42] worry manifest is to make known let's
[1:45:45] make God known he'll make us
[1:45:48] known that's the key make him known
[1:45:52] Jesus J made his father known and he
[1:45:55] come in behind him and made him
[1:45:58] known hallu this is my beloved Son in
[1:46:02] whom I police to dwell
[1:46:04] in read Luke 10 and 21 through 24 along
[1:46:08] with that about the who the son will
[1:46:10] reveal that's right see it's not the
[1:46:13] making known of the sons of God but it's
[1:46:17] the sons of God that want to make their
[1:46:20] father known
[1:46:26] brother brand wouldn't try to make
[1:46:27] himself
[1:46:31] known he was trying to make Jesus Christ
[1:46:34] known and what happened Jesus Christ
[1:46:36] made him
[1:46:41] known keep this in mind now what I've
[1:46:44] taught to you for 40
[1:46:45] years an adoption that we see the father
[1:46:48] is coming on the scene by the nature if
[1:46:51] is the nature being in Steed into the
[1:46:53] son and we would lift up then the father
[1:46:59] amen you remember the signant don't come
[1:47:01] from the son the signant comes from the
[1:47:07] father see most people teach that
[1:47:09] adoption is the son being revealed no
[1:47:12] it's
[1:47:13] not the true Revelation is making known
[1:47:17] of the son the Sons and Daughters of God
[1:47:19] making God known which is the revelation
[1:47:21] of Jesus Christ that's right we make him
[1:47:23] known by preaching the word and he'll
[1:47:26] make his children known then by signs
[1:47:28] and wonders you don't have to worry
[1:47:30] about right now let's get down to
[1:47:33] something and think about it see the
[1:47:35] Bible is the complete Revelation then of
[1:47:37] Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ is
[1:47:39] almighty God all right everybody with
[1:47:43] me we're doing good but we're at 10:00
[1:47:45] near
[1:47:47] 10 I'm not make it
[1:47:50] yet all right see it's not the revealing
[1:47:54] of Jesus the
[1:47:56] man
[1:47:57] right but the revealing of Jesus Christ
[1:48:01] who is almighty
[1:48:04] God
[1:48:08] now I'll bring this on to completion in
[1:48:11] a minute over
[1:48:13] here you see church this is the way I
[1:48:15] believe and I'm just tell you what I
[1:48:16] believe
[1:48:18] okay I believe there's only one true and
[1:48:21] living God that's right
[1:48:23] yeah I don't believe in Eternal
[1:48:29] sunship what about
[1:48:31] you your Prophet didn't believe in
[1:48:33] Eternal sunship the Bible don't believe
[1:48:36] in Eternal
[1:48:40] sunship but if Moses could go by
[1:48:43] inspiration and go back in there and
[1:48:47] bring out the things he did why have you
[1:48:49] got trouble with brother brandham when
[1:48:51] he says it this way
[1:48:54] is in Christ The Mystery of God
[1:48:57] revealed let's go back into the back
[1:48:59] part of God's
[1:49:03] mind you never heard a theologian talk
[1:49:06] like that have you go back into the back
[1:49:09] part of God's mind and see it's
[1:49:11] three-fold Revelation and see that that
[1:49:15] three-fold
[1:49:16] Revelation has to be written
[1:49:19] down right cuz remember we're not back
[1:49:22] to where Moses started it to where God
[1:49:24] could reveal it and he'd write it down
[1:49:26] we're here where it's all got to match
[1:49:28] what he
[1:49:32] said if the New Testament don't match
[1:49:34] the Old Testament then you you done
[1:49:35] missed it somewhere if this message of
[1:49:37] the hour doesn't match the whole Bible
[1:49:39] we missed the entire thing H see how it
[1:49:42] was written God gave the Revelation to
[1:49:45] Jesus
[1:49:47] Christ let me say it another word God
[1:49:49] gave his Revelation to his son amen
[1:49:52] right our God became the
[1:49:59] son God became the son the great Eternal
[1:50:03] Elohim became all of this logos word Son
[1:50:06] of God
[1:50:08] the with another God God in another
[1:50:13] form there's a quote in here somewhere
[1:50:15] you'll find it in your notes we don't
[1:50:16] believe in Eternal sunship but you know
[1:50:18] what we believe in you know what your
[1:50:20] Prophet said he believed in Eternal
[1:50:21] godship amen yes that's right right
[1:50:24] that's in one of your notes we'll find
[1:50:26] it in a minute it don't to in your notes
[1:50:28] he said I believe in Eternal
[1:50:33] godship
[1:50:34] why because
[1:50:37] God has
[1:50:41] condescended how could you understand
[1:50:43] him as we started off with a great
[1:50:45] Eternal one so I've been taking like the
[1:50:48] Bible to show you how it's written to
[1:50:50] show you how that the prophet would know
[1:50:53] see the prophet would
[1:50:56] know what happened
[1:50:58] everywhere why because he would enter
[1:51:00] the mind of God and as Moses would enter
[1:51:03] the mind of God and go backward now
[1:51:07] listen and write all that had
[1:51:11] happened this Prophet goes into the mind
[1:51:13] of God and goes
[1:51:16] forward now his farward can't match up
[1:51:19] because uh eternity's like a
[1:51:25] circle so whatever Moses started with
[1:51:28] has got to end with because it's got to
[1:51:30] tie back to Moses and make the circle
[1:51:32] all right are you with
[1:51:35] me so now if Moses has got one God and
[1:51:38] we got three where is it going to match
[1:51:40] back up we got a problem hooking
[1:51:42] together to Circle
[1:51:44] yeah right what if we got the same God
[1:51:53] the Son of God is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:51:57] the angel of the
[1:51:59] Covenant come on let's see if I can get
[1:52:01] over here in a
[1:52:03] hurry the bride is part of the mystery
[1:52:05] page 74 Christ The Mystery of God
[1:52:07] revealed other than not your notes but
[1:52:09] she's part of the mystery must be
[1:52:11] revealed right that's why she's in the
[1:52:13] Book of
[1:52:14] Revelations but now watch this this a
[1:52:16] minute and then I'll I'll try to bring
[1:52:18] it to a close and then we can you can
[1:52:20] have questions and answers whatever you
[1:52:22] want to do
[1:52:23] first we see Elohim who dwelt
[1:52:28] alone
[1:52:30] Elohim back here in
[1:52:35] eternity all
[1:52:37] alone he had his thoughts he had his
[1:52:40] attributes in him but he was still
[1:52:46] alone now listen to what your Prophet
[1:52:48] had to
[1:52:50] say he said it's hard to explain it's on
[1:52:53] there in Hebrews cuz I'm off my notes
[1:52:56] now it's in Hebrews he said it's hard to
[1:52:59] explain but
[1:53:01] said he's a part of
[1:53:07] God part of
[1:53:10] God and he said he's all the
[1:53:13] God he say it's hard to
[1:53:17] explain now we got the English word SW
[1:53:20] ago that you was following with me and I
[1:53:22] said now don't backpedal okay you
[1:53:25] remember made a statement don't
[1:53:26] backpedal
[1:53:28] okay see brother random said and the
[1:53:31] quotes are in here and if I get to them
[1:53:32] I'll catch them and read
[1:53:36] them that Jesus was a fullness of the
[1:53:40] godhead bodily
[1:53:42] yeah but he said to logos the theophany
[1:53:45] the word that went out was a part of God
[1:53:55] now what does part
[1:54:03] mean I I love banana
[1:54:07] pudding but if you hand me some that
[1:54:12] you've already ate out
[1:54:15] of it's not all
[1:54:17] mine I only get a part
[1:54:26] the logos the theophany the word was a
[1:54:29] part of God because it was God in
[1:54:32] another form called a
[1:54:34] son right we don't believe in Eternal
[1:54:37] sunship and you know there is a time if
[1:54:40] I get time to get to it there is a time
[1:54:43] to where that the sunship will be
[1:54:48] surrendered that's in the Bible
[1:54:52] that God may be all in
[1:54:57] all will he go out of existence don't be
[1:55:02] carnal no attribute that God has ever
[1:55:05] had will ever be done away
[1:55:11] with it may not be in the use form and
[1:55:14] when we get into eternity of needing a
[1:55:16] Healer no and he won't me a savior no
[1:55:19] but it won't do be done away with
[1:55:22] that's right amen we'll still know him
[1:55:25] as that brother Brandon said we'd go up
[1:55:28] on the mountain with him and say papa
[1:55:29] God if you had
[1:55:36] come when
[1:55:39] God was Elohim the self-existing
[1:55:46] one the place he was existing in would
[1:55:49] have to be more real
[1:55:52] than where we are now or what kind of a
[1:55:55] god do you think you
[1:55:58] have when he just floating around he was
[1:56:01] just floating around waiting on
[1:56:02] something to happen floating around in
[1:56:04] white space wasn't
[1:56:06] there what your Prophet said come on he
[1:56:09] said there was no space there was no
[1:56:11] molecule there was no hour there was not
[1:56:13] a
[1:56:18] thing but you know what I like about it
[1:56:23] God is a being he's not like the wind he
[1:56:26] has a place where he dwells at and
[1:56:28] that's called
[1:56:31] Heaven oh I've heard people try to
[1:56:33] explain that you know to where they said
[1:56:35] well now what it is God's living in here
[1:56:37] now so you agree and I said yeah I agree
[1:56:39] well then the devil's in here and God's
[1:56:41] in here arguing it out I said boy you
[1:56:42] got to mix
[1:56:44] up CU my Bible says God won't dwell in
[1:56:47] an unclean vessel now well where's it at
[1:56:50] cuz ain't no Heaven who do R away with
[1:56:56] it you know that God's up there right
[1:56:59] now talking to the
[1:57:01] devil and he's trying his best that's
[1:57:03] what the Bible says and he's trying his
[1:57:05] best to make you sleeping make you this
[1:57:07] make you tired make you worried he doing
[1:57:08] everything he can and trying to get God
[1:57:10] to help
[1:57:12] him
[1:57:14] that's you see God is a
[1:57:18] being he's a
[1:57:20] person yes sir listen now I'm quoting
[1:57:23] it's down through there on the pages on
[1:57:25] your notes when he the Holy Ghost is
[1:57:27] come he is a personal
[1:57:33] pronoun ain't much of an English major
[1:57:35] but I I know a little bit about
[1:57:38] that he is a person the Holy Ghost is a
[1:57:42] person
[1:57:43] yes no the Holy Ghost is just a spirit
[1:57:48] where'd you get that
[1:57:50] from cuz it said when the Holy Ghost has
[1:57:53] gone he's a person he's a being all
[1:57:56] right that's number 19 on your notes
[1:57:59] what who is this Mel Chic he's a being
[1:58:01] he's not like the wind you'll also find
[1:58:03] it and it wasn't so from the beginning
[1:58:06] 1960 you'll find him say it on uh the
[1:58:10] position in Christ
[1:58:12] 1960 see we want to say he's a spirit
[1:58:16] but the Bible and the prophet says he's
[1:58:18] a being he's a person read all those
[1:58:20] quotes on down below there
[1:58:25] he's the Holy
[1:58:27] Ghost he is a personal
[1:58:30] pronoun that's go wait Jesus
[1:58:36] 1963 brother around said that when the
[1:58:39] beginning started we all can tell about
[1:58:41] the story of it and asked about it but
[1:58:42] if you'd read these two or three
[1:58:44] messages or listen to them or something
[1:58:46] get questions and answers on
[1:58:48] Genesis and that's 1953 72 9 uh get the
[1:58:54] message attitude and who is God 1950
[1:58:58] 8:15 uh get that one the message life
[1:59:01] which is preached in
[1:59:03] 1957 um all of them it's wrote down on
[1:59:06] those notes in front of you you got you
[1:59:09] know how about taking those books and
[1:59:11] reading them how about getting those
[1:59:13] messages and reading
[1:59:16] them and see what your Prophet
[1:59:19] said he said there we are going back
[1:59:22] before the
[1:59:24] world he said back before there was even
[1:59:26] a beginning of anything when he was
[1:59:30] eternal and said out of the Eternal came
[1:59:33] the
[1:59:34] word said that's the Loos or Son of
[1:59:40] God came the word a part of
[1:59:48] God brother I thought Jesus was all God
[1:59:51] he he
[1:59:54] was he's all of God we'll get to that in
[1:59:58] a second Loos word theop Son of God time
[2:00:02] didn't start until the fall so that's
[2:00:04] when he started keeping up with it you
[2:00:06] know but now listen the logos is a part
[2:00:09] of God right God gave birth number 29
[2:00:14] questions and answers on Genesis God
[2:00:17] gave himself birth to His Son part of
[2:00:20] God Amen
[2:00:27] part of God inspiration
[2:00:30] and impersonations of Christ 57 12 uh
[2:00:35] 120 yet it was all
[2:00:38] God part of
[2:00:40] God what's your Prophet
[2:00:43] say now he definitely knows the
[2:00:46] difference between all and
[2:00:48] part wouldn't you think so yes
[2:00:52] what's he
[2:00:55] saying why would he call the logos the
[2:00:57] theophany the Creator and all why would
[2:00:59] he call that part of
[2:01:04] God now in a
[2:01:06] minute I exppress what I've seen for 40
[2:01:11] years but hold
[2:01:13] on if a part of God means what it says
[2:01:17] then there must be more of God right
[2:01:23] that
[2:01:26] sensible come on is that
[2:01:30] sensible if the logos the Creator and
[2:01:32] all like that the Son of God was part of
[2:01:36] God that means it must be more of God
[2:01:43] Amen but to keep the story
[2:01:49] straight it wasn't another God that went
[2:01:52] out in the beginning that's
[2:01:54] right it was
[2:01:57] God who came out in the
[2:01:59] beginning and took upon himself the form
[2:02:02] of the word the theophany the
[2:02:07] logos and can't you just see old
[2:02:13] Satan Angels created now way before we
[2:02:16] talking about in
[2:02:18] Genesis can't you just see old Satan and
[2:02:20] how upset he gets because he' always
[2:02:22] thought he was the anointed cherub
[2:02:24] that's what scripture called him and he
[2:02:26] always
[2:02:28] thought that he was God's right-hand
[2:02:33] man and that's when he got messed up
[2:02:37] that's what happened to some people
[2:02:38] around here they thought they was
[2:02:40] brother Dale's right-and man and they
[2:02:42] come find out it don't work that
[2:02:46] way time runs out I'll turn this over to
[2:02:49] somebody else but ain't nobody in my
[2:02:50] rightand man my right-and man is the
[2:02:53] Lord Jesus
[2:02:55] Christ I don't have a right-and
[2:02:58] man you can't be my right hand land
[2:03:00] don't
[2:03:01] try cuz you can't walk where I
[2:03:04] walk cuz I can't walk where you
[2:03:09] walk but listen he was a part of
[2:03:17] God but he was all of God Amen right
[2:03:25] now we're going to get to why he called
[2:03:27] him
[2:03:32] aart because see people say I know
[2:03:36] brother randam got the
[2:03:38] quotes so all God was he poured into
[2:03:41] Christ and all Christ into the
[2:03:45] church and they make your beautiful
[2:03:47] drawings and people shout Glory
[2:03:49] Hallelujah of how wonderful it looks
[2:03:54] and not realizing what they're
[2:03:58] saying in no way in the world am I going
[2:04:02] to ever take him out of
[2:04:05] Eternity
[2:04:07] Elohim who do you pray to right
[2:04:12] amen see and if you realize
[2:04:16] who the Lord Jesus Christ is amen you
[2:04:19] can pray to him that's right now they're
[2:04:22] saying in the message now don't pray to
[2:04:23] Jesus because he was just a
[2:04:28] man I pray to the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:04:31] which is almighty
[2:04:33] God you ever notice your Prophet will
[2:04:36] say I told you Wednesday you ever notice
[2:04:38] your Prophet will say it like this he
[2:04:40] say father I thank you that you sent
[2:04:43] your son to Die For Me Right looks
[2:04:46] exactly like he's talking about two
[2:04:49] people but he's not
[2:04:52] amen cuz you
[2:04:54] see the Eternal God changed his
[2:05:01] form to become the word the
[2:05:04] Loos God in another
[2:05:07] form called a son we don't believe in
[2:05:10] Eternal
[2:05:13] sunship so then you can't place and make
[2:05:16] Jesus Eternal there's no such thing as
[2:05:19] an eternal
[2:05:20] son listen their sons and daughters that
[2:05:24] are
[2:05:25] Eternal and Jesus was a Son of God which
[2:05:29] was eternal amen
[2:05:32] that's but you don't have eternal
[2:05:35] sunship it won't work so all God
[2:05:41] was he poured into
[2:05:47] Christ but you ain't going to see me
[2:05:49] race that out at all amen
[2:05:54] I'm going to leave it just the way I had
[2:05:55] way to draw
[2:05:58] it cuz it's not a beautiful Revelation
[2:06:01] to see all God was he poured into Christ
[2:06:04] you don't realize you've left a vacuum
[2:06:07] you've left a hole a space or something
[2:06:10] you've left a a part that God cannot
[2:06:13] exist
[2:06:16] in Jesus prayed to his father right oh
[2:06:21] what it was he just praying inside
[2:06:25] himself
[2:06:29] no was he praying inside of himself when
[2:06:31] he screamed out on the cross my God my
[2:06:34] God why has Thou forsaken me he said
[2:06:37] that was this the flesh yes the flesh
[2:06:40] was screaming out but the Eternal God
[2:06:43] was still there see that's where man's
[2:06:45] missed it those that believe Jesus was
[2:06:47] not god Till The River Jordan they take
[2:06:49] that anointing off of him in the garden
[2:06:51] brother ROM talks about it leaving him
[2:06:53] but they make him to where he's just a
[2:06:55] man and he goes to Calvary and dies as a
[2:06:58] man brother R said no man can die for
[2:07:01] you he said it was almighty God that
[2:07:04] died my God can't
[2:07:08] die well I'd like to talk to you about
[2:07:11] mine cuz he gave his life
[2:07:13] up see that's where people don't believe
[2:07:15] God like I believe
[2:07:19] him I believe in body the prophet said
[2:07:21] he was a
[2:07:23] man but in Soul and Spirit he was
[2:07:26] almighty God so when he hung on the tree
[2:07:29] that almighty God that was inside of
[2:07:31] there just left the body
[2:07:33] right let R off
[2:07:38] right that's one
[2:07:41] God one
[2:07:44] God the see is he really wants to reveal
[2:07:48] himself so then when you say oh God what
[2:07:50] you say well you going to cor R ROM
[2:07:52] because there's a lot of quote probably
[2:07:53] about 26 I think where he said all God
[2:07:55] was he ped into
[2:07:58] Christ and I think there's
[2:08:02] eight that said all God was he poured
[2:08:05] into
[2:08:06] Jesus which is no problem with me just
[2:08:09] to show you that it's there show you how
[2:08:11] much I do try to study it out he did say
[2:08:13] Jesus cuz I thought now he never used
[2:08:15] the word Jesus he used Christ and then I
[2:08:17] thought I better check it and I run it
[2:08:18] in there was eight quotes and he said oh
[2:08:21] was he poured into
[2:08:23] Jesus what it
[2:08:25] was just poured in him
[2:08:29] there he wasn't all of God when he was
[2:08:31] born as a
[2:08:33] baby even your Prophet don't do it he
[2:08:36] don't cover him all of God until the
[2:08:37] River
[2:08:40] Jordan cuz he couldn't be he was God but
[2:08:43] he couldn't be your
[2:08:45] savior 12 years
[2:08:49] old he couldn't display those things
[2:08:51] until he come to the point of the world
[2:08:54] that
[2:08:54] it he became who he's supposed to
[2:08:58] be you said now what are you saying then
[2:09:01] see this is the way I see
[2:09:03] God like I said if you say all God was
[2:09:07] I'm going to cover this up to where just
[2:09:10] to show up that way you say all God
[2:09:13] was I can't cover the whole thing but
[2:09:15] you get the point they'll get it on the
[2:09:16] thing all God was he poured into Christ
[2:09:18] you just left an empty thing there
[2:09:22] who do you pray
[2:09:23] to well I pray to Christ wait just a
[2:09:25] minute because the same Prophet said all
[2:09:28] Christ was poured into the church now do
[2:09:30] you pray to the church where's
[2:09:33] Catholicism got you tied up
[2:09:35] at you don't realize you're right in the
[2:09:38] Trap Of The
[2:09:39] Devil I'm trying to tell people that it
[2:09:41] ain't going to change them
[2:09:44] no you say well brother Dale
[2:09:47] then what are you trying to say
[2:09:51] now this little line right here
[2:09:53] represents
[2:09:58] eternity I don't
[2:10:00] believe all of God crossed that line
[2:10:03] into
[2:10:09] time but Brother D all God was well
[2:10:12] let's take that statement let's take the
[2:10:14] English
[2:10:15] words oh God was
[2:10:23] where would that be
[2:10:25] at all God was would put a space on it
[2:10:28] or a time or an
[2:10:34] element and if you poured it all into
[2:10:37] Christ you're going to do away with God
[2:10:39] you're a Oneness and don't realize what
[2:10:41] you're doing that's
[2:10:44] right cuz they can make beautiful
[2:10:46] statements about it but that don't help
[2:10:48] me cuz you see I got to preach what's
[2:10:50] from my heart
[2:10:54] but brother Dale I thought all God came
[2:10:56] over here into this
[2:10:58] word where'd you get the
[2:11:06] idea where did you get that idea when
[2:11:09] the prophet of God
[2:11:13] said let's see if I can find
[2:11:27] listen to what your Prophet had to
[2:11:29] say page 211 Church age book number 33
[2:11:33] on your
[2:11:37] not now then there is also the thought
[2:11:40] of this future partaking of the Hidden
[2:11:43] Mana I think it will be the Eternal
[2:11:46] partaking of the revelation of Jesus
[2:11:48] Christ in the Eternal ages is to come
[2:11:53] amen how else could we begin to know the
[2:11:56] unsearchable riches of his own being all
[2:12:00] that we have longed to know all our
[2:12:03] unanswered
[2:12:05] questions all that will be
[2:12:09] revealed will be from Christ who is our
[2:12:12] life that we
[2:12:14] received oh sometimes we think we get to
[2:12:17] know a little of him and his word down
[2:12:19] here in it is so good it makes us
[2:12:23] rejoice but one day when our flesh
[2:12:26] changes that word and he will become
[2:12:28] what we had never dreamed possible
[2:12:33] Right
[2:12:35] amen 242 of the church a book it is the
[2:12:40] morning star that is visible when the
[2:12:42] light of the sun commences to shine when
[2:12:45] our son Jesus comes there will be no
[2:12:48] further need of Messengers
[2:12:51] he will bring us his message of cheer
[2:12:53] himself and as he rules his kingdom and
[2:12:57] we live in his presence the light of the
[2:12:59] word will become brighter and
[2:13:03] brighter in our perfect
[2:13:07] day see church I to think and I've told
[2:13:10] you over and over and over and over I
[2:13:13] believe we're only getting enough here
[2:13:16] to be able to go to heaven am to realize
[2:13:18] what's taking place that's all I've ever
[2:13:21] we're trying to tell you now if he's
[2:13:23] going to give us a message of
[2:13:25] cheer after this world then there
[2:13:27] something about God that's not revealed
[2:13:29] to you and I while we're here yeah but
[2:13:31] around say oh God was all me
[2:13:34] all now you said we don't talk like that
[2:13:37] that's what they
[2:13:41] say but now we just showed where the
[2:13:43] Prophet is talking about something after
[2:13:45] this world do you mean what what we're
[2:13:47] getting here is all we're going to get
[2:13:51] when we get to heaven we're going to set
[2:13:52] up there and look at each other and say
[2:13:53] well was a great time while we had down
[2:13:55] there wouldn't
[2:13:59] it no this is just the the playgrounds
[2:14:02] to get
[2:14:03] ready down through the endless
[2:14:07] eternities God will be giving us his
[2:14:09] message of cheer about
[2:14:12] him remember the other night brother
[2:14:14] Gary when I said there attributes about
[2:14:16] God that ain't been displayed you say
[2:14:18] well what are they don't ask me where do
[2:14:20] we get there
[2:14:24] I got enough to go from here but you
[2:14:26] understand what I'm saying now this is
[2:14:27] what I believe now this is what I
[2:14:29] believe you you you
[2:14:31] do leave him
[2:14:35] there but let enough of God come over
[2:14:38] into here to be the word the logos the
[2:14:43] theophany of the
[2:14:44] things and let it come on over into to
[2:14:47] you and I right and then let us go back
[2:14:52] go back one of these
[2:14:56] days let's see if I can find
[2:15:01] it cuz the scripture I'm talking about
[2:15:03] is
[2:15:06] in
[2:15:09] Corinthians okay excuse me I'll have to
[2:15:13] find it it's back in my notes it's in
[2:15:15] Corinthians where that God may be all
[2:15:16] and all let me see if I can find it's in
[2:15:19] Corinthians I'm sure
[2:15:26] 15 1 Corinthians
[2:15:31] 15 1 Corinthians 15:26 while you're
[2:15:34] getting there but I eny that shall be
[2:15:37] destroyed his death for he hath put all
[2:15:40] things under his feet but when he saith
[2:15:43] all things are put under him it is
[2:15:45] Manifest that he is
[2:15:47] accepted which did put all things under
[2:15:50] him and when all things shall be subdued
[2:15:52] unto
[2:15:54] him now that him there's Jesus Christ
[2:15:57] right okay then shall the son him son
[2:16:01] also himself be subject unto him the
[2:16:04] father that put all things under him
[2:16:08] that God may be all in all
[2:16:16] right it's on the back of one of you
[2:16:18] your notes
[2:16:21] blank sheep you got
[2:16:23] back Christ is the mystery of God
[2:16:25] revealed look where brother R places
[2:16:27] this and God at that day the kingdom be
[2:16:30] given over to the father he might be all
[2:16:33] in
[2:16:35] all listen while he's yet speaking I'll
[2:16:38] hear days of Christ David sitting on the
[2:16:42] throne the king over the whole human
[2:16:44] race where's that happen where's David
[2:16:46] sit on the throne millennial reain
[2:16:52] okay in the millennial Reign you'll see
[2:16:55] him as all in
[2:16:58] all you'll be the only what sees him
[2:17:01] right that's right the world can't see
[2:17:04] him that's right the world still won't
[2:17:06] know who he is they'll think he's God
[2:17:09] yes but they'll just say okay but the
[2:17:11] bride will know in the Millennium that
[2:17:13] he is all in all you know why cuz he'll
[2:17:18] be in all okay
[2:17:21] you see where the Prophet placed it
[2:17:22] Millennial Reign okay now jump up future
[2:17:26] home 1964
[2:17:29] 802 sitting with the throne in the top
[2:17:33] Now where's that at Revelations
[2:17:35] 21:23 and they need no light for the
[2:17:38] lamb and the Lord is a light thereof the
[2:17:41] Lord God is the pillar of fire that
[2:17:43] followed the children of Israel through
[2:17:45] the
[2:17:45] Wilderness and he is ascended upon the
[2:17:48] throne in that perfect Kingdom when time
[2:17:52] the kingdom that Jesus is to surrender
[2:17:55] to the father that God might be all in
[2:17:59] all Jesus sets upon his throne here as
[2:18:02] our Joseph so you know he's not doing
[2:18:04] away with
[2:18:05] him but what's happening that's
[2:18:09] right son will not go out of existence
[2:18:14] no
[2:18:15] amen but we don't believe in eternal
[2:18:18] sunship
[2:18:22] right we believe in Eternal godship but
[2:18:25] not Eternal sunship one more time to
[2:18:28] make you make sure you don't
[2:18:30] misunderstand me whether you believe it
[2:18:31] or not that's up to you I can't do
[2:18:34] nothing I believe the Eternal
[2:18:37] self-existing Elohim that was only a
[2:18:40] part of him come
[2:18:42] over
[2:18:43] amen and there was something about him
[2:18:46] that was not brought
[2:18:47] over into the revelation
[2:18:53] yeah one of these days when we finish
[2:18:57] this journey through the word that the
[2:18:58] offy and all and this over here won't be
[2:19:01] the fall no
[2:19:04] more but when we do we'll see him as he
[2:19:09] is cu the scripture says we'll be like
[2:19:12] him I cut out a whole bunch and now so
[2:19:15] just forgive me cuz that's already 20
[2:19:17] after
[2:19:19] 10 listen listen
[2:19:21] church you can make a lot of drawings
[2:19:24] you can make a lot of words it takes a
[2:19:26] God to reveal his
[2:19:29] word you say I don't know what in the
[2:19:31] word you was talking
[2:19:33] about I'm simply talking about one
[2:19:38] thing the day you receive the new birth
[2:19:41] you only
[2:19:42] receive God as a baby
[2:19:47] form which can be called a part of God
[2:19:53] you grow up the stature of a perfect man
[2:19:55] we come out to the place that the
[2:19:56] prophet talked about
[2:19:58] adoption and then we get a change one
[2:20:02] day and all of this carnality be
[2:20:07] gone you see all of God wasn't brought
[2:20:10] down to
[2:20:12] mankind or else it would not be a
[2:20:14] message of cheer else there would not be
[2:20:18] anything left for us to talk about any
[2:20:20] [Music]
[2:20:25] ET I love him and that's who cuz that's
[2:20:29] the way I
[2:20:31] see that he's revealed
[2:20:34] himself to you and
[2:20:37] me by way of the Prophet
[2:20:40] messenger and no greater honor could be
[2:20:42] given unto that
[2:20:45] Prophet than to be able to introduce us
[2:20:47] to Jesus Christ
[2:20:53] if time passes off everything's
[2:20:57] gone I just want to make him known to
[2:21:03] you and my God hasn't
[2:21:07] ended because I didn't erase him out
[2:21:10] when I said all God
[2:21:12] was he poured into
[2:21:14] Christ I don't believe your Prophet did
[2:21:17] because your Prophet was the one that
[2:21:19] said they would be a message after we're
[2:21:25] through but it was all that you and I
[2:21:27] can
[2:21:29] comprehend all that came on this side of
[2:21:31] Eternity to be revealed to mankind was
[2:21:34] revealed through Jesus Christ that's
[2:21:38] right that's why Genesis and Revelation
[2:21:41] has the same identical
[2:21:44] beginning the Revelation that God give
[2:21:46] to Jesus to give to John
[2:21:51] back in eternity Before Time Ever begun
[2:21:53] existence whatsoever God had a plan and
[2:21:56] a
[2:21:58] purpose and as he did he unfolded that
[2:22:02] by coming himself not sending a
[2:22:05] son he didn't send somebody else don't
[2:22:08] get that in your mind of what brother
[2:22:10] Dale would be saying he came
[2:22:14] himself but now we'll go back to why we
[2:22:16] read Deuteronomy
[2:22:18] 29:29 because it says the secret things
[2:22:21] belong unto God right but those things
[2:22:25] that are revealed belong unto his
[2:22:29] children thank God for what he's
[2:22:31] revealed to
[2:22:33] us thank God for the revelation of his
[2:22:36] word because you might not understand
[2:22:39] why I spent so much time talking about
[2:22:40] the writing of the Bible because the
[2:22:42] writing of the Bible is one thing for
[2:22:45] certain your Prophet had to have
[2:22:47] something for it to come from
[2:22:51] if Moses went into the mind of God and
[2:22:54] wrote the five books and told you what
[2:22:56] happened in the garden I ain't got no
[2:22:58] problem with brother Brown I'm going
[2:22:59] into eternity and coming back out from
[2:23:02] the very back part of God's mind to tell
[2:23:05] me all about it but remember one thing
[2:23:07] he had to line all of that up with what
[2:23:09] Moses had to
[2:23:11] say he couldn't change it you take these
[2:23:15] Eternal sunship and stuff it won't match
[2:23:18] you take the river Jordans the soul two
[2:23:20] soul the doctr like it won't match
[2:23:23] up because you got to leave things out
[2:23:27] that brother randam said bring one thing
[2:23:29] to me that I've left out tonight and
[2:23:31] let's
[2:23:33] see let's let the Holy
[2:23:37] Ghost cuz he's the only one that can
[2:23:39] reveal the
[2:23:41] word I can't do it I wish I could I I do
[2:23:43] anything in the world I could to reveal
[2:23:45] it to
[2:23:46] you but you see I met God a long time
[2:23:50] time
[2:23:53] ago and he told me what to bring and
[2:23:55] that was to stay with his
[2:23:58] word I fought it out with a lot of men
[2:24:01] over the
[2:24:03] time had a lot of
[2:24:05] problems but you know none of them has
[2:24:07] been no problem to me because I've tried
[2:24:10] to get people to see
[2:24:13] God the god I
[2:24:17] see and like brother randam said about
[2:24:19] it he said don't don't you throw off on
[2:24:21] them
[2:24:24] legalist he said they'll be
[2:24:29] there that's what he
[2:24:31] said so how could we throw off on
[2:24:33] anybody else when I say A doctorine or
[2:24:36] idea or something I don't agree with I'm
[2:24:38] just warning you not to get caught with
[2:24:43] it
[2:24:47] because it's almighty God is leading all
[2:24:49] of us
[2:24:53] but if what I said doesn't fit then all
[2:24:56] right just come and tell me about
[2:24:59] it let me
[2:25:01] know but it's like I've always told
[2:25:05] you please come to me and let me
[2:25:09] know don't go to everybody else and tell
[2:25:13] them come to me and tell me you don't
[2:25:16] agree then you can go anywhere you want
[2:25:18] to and talk to anybody you want to talk
[2:25:20] about me and tell them how wrong I
[2:25:23] am but you owe it to me
[2:25:26] first but see people won't do
[2:25:30] that they'll go away and they'll say
[2:25:33] well I'm not going to hinder no
[2:25:34] whatsoever but then as quick as they get
[2:25:36] away they start doing everything they
[2:25:37] can to hinder and cut off and cut your
[2:25:40] throat and everything
[2:25:43] else but you
[2:25:45] see go ahead I love God and I love you
[2:25:53] any questions
[2:25:57] 10:30 anybody any questions comments
[2:26:00] thoughts whatever hang on a minute we
[2:26:02] have to get a have to cut me off here
[2:26:04] and we have to get

[2:27:04] it when brother Brian was taken beyond
[2:27:07] the curtain of time he said he wanted to
[2:27:09] see Jesus and they said he couldn't cuz
[2:27:11] he was up higher is that the place where
[2:27:13] Elohim has always been and will we ever
[2:27:17] see that place
[2:27:20] yeah I would agree that that's where
[2:27:23] Elohim is he's higher and uh I believe
[2:27:27] we're going to see that place when we go
[2:27:29] there am I don't believe we're going to
[2:27:32] you know go there ourselves now and see
[2:27:34] it uh brother brandham he couldn't even
[2:27:37] go
[2:27:38] there he you know you remember this the
[2:27:40] story that when he beyond the curtain of
[2:27:42] time that that he he wanted to see Jesus
[2:27:45] he said he's hired but said you can't go
[2:27:48] there the
[2:27:50] but one of these days we're going higher
[2:27:53] but by revelation we better get to be
[2:27:55] able to see Jesus cuz I like what Paul
[2:27:57] said he said I might not see all things
[2:27:59] but I see
[2:28:00] Jesus I want to see Jesus that's what I
[2:28:03] want to
[2:28:04] see Jesus
[2:28:06] Christ but that's another dimension
[2:28:08] that's a travel so we'd have to go and
[2:28:11] brother random couldn't go so there's no
[2:28:12] needing us worried about it we just go
[2:28:15] on what we're doing here cuz I'm looking
[2:28:17] forward to getting dark
[2:28:20] I am I'm looking forward to get to
[2:28:22] heaven it won't be no carnality then I
[2:28:25] can look at brother Thomas Brother
[2:28:28] Anderson going to get the wrong name I
[2:28:30] can look at Brother Anderson like I said
[2:28:31] a while ago and I can transmit to it
[2:28:34] there but I can't do it now is that what
[2:28:35] you're talking
[2:28:37] about who'll be
[2:28:40] next brother
[2:28:46] Joe yeah we've been working in visions
[2:28:50] dreams and dimensions and uh he was
[2:28:53] talking about brother was in the sixth
[2:28:54] Dimension and God is in the seventh
[2:28:56] Dimension that's why they told him he
[2:28:58] couldn't go I know yet I guess mhm right
[2:29:03] go that's another dimension going
[2:29:05] brother brother
[2:29:06] [Music]
[2:29:09] dick the thought the thought come to me
[2:29:12] and saying what you said to me what
[2:29:14] sister Trudy said see Jesus was in
[2:29:18] another dimension he had an Earthly body
[2:29:21] mhm see brother bandam didn't have
[2:29:24] Earthly body at that time right so when
[2:29:26] we take on our Earthly body and go in
[2:29:30] then we'll go into the same Dimension
[2:29:32] here that's my thought now and this
[2:29:35] right here uh what you read a while ago
[2:29:38] the tharan church age it said when it
[2:29:41] talk about the Morning
[2:29:43] Star I think he's telling you or telling
[2:29:47] me that uh what makes the morning star
[2:29:50] light up is the sun true and I believe
[2:29:53] that's taking place right now right well
[2:29:56] you want to put this on the other side
[2:29:58] but I can see it happening right
[2:30:00] now and what you're ministering and and
[2:30:03] things that are coming to you I believe
[2:30:06] that there's an understanding that's
[2:30:07] going to come from that I don't see it
[2:30:11] all uh the other day what what brother
[2:30:15] uh way preached you know and they were
[2:30:18] talking calling that
[2:30:21] uh let us make man in our image he was
[2:30:24] calling that
[2:30:26] bride the question come to me if that
[2:30:28] was a bride where did the body of Judas
[2:30:31] come
[2:30:33] from the body of Judas come from the
[2:30:36] natural
[2:30:37] creation that was Genesis 2 but he he
[2:30:40] had a he had a a
[2:30:43] spirit and a soul
[2:30:46] mhm true see all right see and so when
[2:30:51] you get down to where uh man was uh
[2:30:55] formed of the Dust of the earth and a
[2:30:59] humorous thought come to me I won't tell
[2:31:00] you what it was told some people but
[2:31:03] anyhow a long long time
[2:31:06] ago uh I found out that the reason why
[2:31:11] uh Adam
[2:31:13] fell because he wasn't all there when
[2:31:17] Eve come to him because because Eve was
[2:31:20] a portion of him and they were
[2:31:25] separated you see what I mean this is me
[2:31:28] talking yeah
[2:31:30] see and I believe it has something to do
[2:31:34] with us getting back in the
[2:31:38] condition that uh like this right here
[2:31:43] uh where you say creation L God word and
[2:31:46] what have you if that's all creation had
[2:31:49] a beginning in
[2:31:50] end everybody El us got to have a
[2:31:54] change because that
[2:31:57] fa this over here didn't
[2:32:00] fall and I you know I'm not being trying
[2:32:02] to be smart I a lot of people I hear
[2:32:05] people say things and I you know I ain't
[2:32:08] trying to be smart or what I want to
[2:32:10] know
[2:32:12] see because I have I think I have things
[2:32:16] happen to me in this secular world
[2:32:20] that I
[2:32:21] know that it's a father yes that's
[2:32:25] leading me to do things and to say
[2:32:28] things
[2:32:30] yeah you know and and like you were you
[2:32:34] were talking about when you talk about
[2:32:35] when it's come to me well look who I
[2:32:38] am and I make the statement when it
[2:32:40] comes to
[2:32:42] me that I could go out and sit down on a
[2:32:45] white line in the middle of the road and
[2:32:48] hang my feet off of exactly that's how
[2:32:50] big it makes me
[2:32:53] feel right you know and I believe that's
[2:32:57] what it's all
[2:32:58] about but all of one day all of this
[2:33:01] will be made known amen but I believe
[2:33:04] that there's got to be a portion of this
[2:33:06] made known to change our
[2:33:11] bodies and and I say this in in what
[2:33:14] Paul wrote there he says without us they
[2:33:18] cannot be made perfect exactly and when
[2:33:20] they cut Paul's head
[2:33:23] off he left us and became one of them
[2:33:27] mhm and when brother brandom
[2:33:30] died he left us exactly and became one
[2:33:34] of them right so this thing is Left To
[2:33:38] Us
[2:33:39] amen like with the brother from Africa
[2:33:41] that got killed you know used to preach
[2:33:45] without us s j us s j s without us he is
[2:33:50] not complet
[2:33:51] right and there's a group of
[2:33:54] people that will be walking this
[2:33:57] Earth they'll never die amen I saw
[2:34:02] that in the Presbyterian Church before I
[2:34:05] ever knew who brother Brown was right
[2:34:08] and like I said that don't make me feel
[2:34:10] like something big up up or what
[2:34:13] Happ because you always was what you
[2:34:16] going to be exactly
[2:34:23] yep so when you you know the other night
[2:34:26] when you talking about that that that
[2:34:29] thing that was created there in our
[2:34:33] image you were calling that bride and I
[2:34:35] saw what you were talking about tonight
[2:34:37] in reference with
[2:34:39] Revelations one yeah but the question
[2:34:43] is where did Judas and Hitler and musini
[2:34:46] and Stalin where did all these
[2:34:50] bodies and souls come from right because
[2:34:53] when he made man he made man
[2:34:57] yeah now that's me
[2:35:00] mhm but see the the point
[2:35:03] is
[2:35:05] that when God created Adam he didn't
[2:35:08] create you and
[2:35:10] me he created man he created Adam see
[2:35:15] all right
[2:35:17] now that would just been him
[2:35:20] coming the man and Adam wasn't Eternal
[2:35:24] the body his soul and his soul was
[2:35:27] eternal right because that would have
[2:35:29] been the the Lost of theophany the 126
[2:35:32] put over into two two there were you
[2:35:35] know let us make man and then that was
[2:35:37] put over in Genesis 2 into flesh so that
[2:35:41] made a human flesh that was not Eternal
[2:35:44] right and made a soul it was and a
[2:35:47] spirit with a perfect creation
[2:35:50] because else could you explain
[2:35:52] it and see he knew his youth was being
[2:35:55] renewed
[2:35:56] daily but his body was not
[2:36:00] Eternal and see that was the catch
[2:36:02] that's why he could fall is because when
[2:36:05] the part was taken from him of being Eve
[2:36:08] you know taken out and made Eve all
[2:36:11] right see then she was put into she was
[2:36:14] a body spirit and a
[2:36:16] soul right and that way I believe that
[2:36:19] wrote around saying her and Adam had the
[2:36:21] same theophany Soul see she had eternal
[2:36:25] life in her soul but she didn't have
[2:36:27] eternal life in her body and spirit you
[2:36:30] see people will say then they'll say
[2:36:31] well well if you got if they got eternal
[2:36:34] life how could they
[2:36:36] fall why do we do
[2:36:39] wrong I mean come on why do we do wrong
[2:36:43] CU we got a body and spirit that's not
[2:36:45] Eternal right we got a soul that's
[2:36:47] Eternal by the new birth so we can do
[2:36:50] wrong see Adam would had the ability to
[2:36:52] do
[2:36:53] wrong because he was a human element but
[2:36:57] see then the others had not come into
[2:37:00] being and uh now I'm not going to say
[2:37:05] that uh cuz you know I'm saying this is
[2:37:08] getting close to what people think uh
[2:37:11] I'm not going to say that uh Judas and
[2:37:15] all of them come from the
[2:37:16] Beast and all these other come from from
[2:37:19] the right lineage cuz that could be what
[2:37:21] you could think of to make a good story
[2:37:23] out of but it won't work because once
[2:37:25] you get over to the floods you cut the
[2:37:27] whole thing off and you got you know I
[2:37:30] listened uh yesterday the prophet
[2:37:32] talking about it and that's why they
[2:37:34] think the black people see was because
[2:37:36] of a curse that was put on Cain he said
[2:37:38] well if that was so said then that would
[2:37:41] do away with the that the flood would be
[2:37:43] done away with cuz only uh you know the
[2:37:46] sons of Noah come across right but see
[2:37:50] then you know you you can't you can't
[2:37:52] say that this is because of that you
[2:37:55] know the the Fallen condition brought
[2:37:57] the black man made him black cuz that's
[2:37:59] what they teach but that he said that's
[2:38:02] not true he said that would have ended
[2:38:03] right there so he had such a way of
[2:38:05] expressing things you know but I want to
[2:38:09] ask you a question about
[2:38:12] it and let's see how much you can think
[2:38:14] about the
[2:38:15] Bible why was it that Adam didn't kill
[2:38:18] Cain
[2:38:20] he was supposed
[2:38:26] to why didn't not kill him he killed his
[2:38:29] son
