jesus christ's name amen amen amen psalms chapter 42 and it says as the heart panet after the water brooks so pantheth my soul after thee o god my soul thirsteth for god for the living god when shall i come in and appear before god my tears have been my meat day and night while they continually say unto me where is thy god when i remember these things i pour out my soul in me for i had gone with the multitude i went with them to the house of god with the voice of joy and praise with a multitude that kept holy day why why art thou cast down on my soul and why art thou disquiet in me hope thou and god for i shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance oh my god my soul was cast down within me therefore while i remember thee from the land of jordan and from the hermanites and from the hill mazar deep calleth unto deep at the voice of thy waterspouts all thy waves and the billows are gone over me yet the lord will command his lovingkindness in the daytime in the night his song shall be with me in my prayer unto the god of my life i will say unto god my rock why hast thou forgotten me why go our mourning because of the opposition of the enemy as with a sword in my bones my enemies reproach me while they say daily unto me where is thy god what if thou cast down o my soul and why art thou disquiet in me hope thou and god for i will yet praise him who is the help of my countenance and my god amen may be seated even blessed reading of the word speak on a little simple fault we'll speak a little i'll speak a little bit about the first and what is your thirst and you know brother brown said that we all have we all have a thirst we all came here with a thirst and you know the last time we were speaking we spoke on on the essence of god and speaking of the attributes of god and you know under understanding that in hebrews in a scripture where it was speaking of when it spoke of the expressed image of god we know that was the the translation of that was the very expression of the essence of god or the attributes of god and you know we understand that there was attributes that god had and he wanted to display and we we know that there came a time and it as brothel has been speaking about you know he said brother brown said you know in the immortal realms back there he said that you know the sons of god came together all you know the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy you know why were they doing that right what was what was going on he said because they saw the plan of salvation where were they where were they they were in eternity that was that was a an attribute of god being displayed and we see that you know here is here is this uh desire yeah because here they are and you know where where were you at when this took place right yeah that's right because if if because as brother brandon said he said if if you were a part of god you were always a part of god you always with god he said and if you weren't you never will be but where where were you at you know when he come when god come to job and he said i require you an answer i want you to i want you to explain to me where were you if you have understanding that then explain this and you know we understanding that from last time we were when we were speaking on the essence of god and understanding because we understand what we can see we see ourselves by seeing who he is when we see when we see in the word who he is and we understand that he has come and we are seeing him through the words we are seeing ourselves and because as the scripture tells us and brother has told us that the scriptures that speak of the groom speak of the bride amen so when we see it when we see who he is then we all see who we are and you know because i i've had a i've had a lot of good feedback but you know i've had some i've had some questions about things that i see it you know you have to understand because brother brother branham said and then and this is the first thing just get this in your mind he said whatever he was you know whatever he is that's what you are right he said he because when we go back and look he said that uh he became sin who knew no sin exactly that we might become the very righteousness of god right amen and understand brother adam said all that god was he poured into christ and then he said all that christ was he poured into the believer he didn't say because he you know because he did say he poured into the body amen but he also said he poured it into the believer that's it and so just take that and say all that god was he poured into christ all that christ was he poured into me and people say oh well god was god was infinite jesus was the infinite son of god but i can't be infinite oh my god you are because you are what he is right that's right amen because so as as he was saying when we look back there he was speaking to job about what took place back there and all that rejoicing he said where were you right if you can see what was going on he said if you were with me come on you were back there come on but but that wasn't when he was speaking of in in the eternity see i want you to see something because when you're speaking of eternity as brother dan was saying when you go that way as far as you can go you're going that way as far as you can go yeah right but if you're going one way you end up coming back the other way see people people are thinking well it was way back it was way back it was eternity right it wasn't it wasn't some past thing it was eternity exactly so when he was speaking of them rejoicing at at what took place it wasn't it wasn't some past happening right because you can't lock time to eternity exactly amen so when he said where were you when the morning started singing together and all the sons of god shouted for joy where were you we were in eternity amen where was eternity right amen amen see when you when you look at it it's not so it's not something past happening right it wasn't something happening that was in the past because one of these days we're coming to that come on right we're coming to the place where we're going to be rejoicing at our salvation come on glory we don't we don't see our salvation the way we ought to that's right that's right see we're still bound in a world right we're still bound by a carnal mind come on exactly but see what is your thirst right see that's what we know that's what i need to look for what is our first because every man has been given a thirst but we need to we need to think about that right and i can i you know because we didn't we weren't back there as identities right amen but see god could see what was going to take place and it's in his great infinite wisdom he knew what was going to happen he wouldn't knew what was going to be in front because it that's how he could predestinate by his foreknowledge right because he knew it was going to take place he would know what the end from the beginning right so when when he came see none of that nothing took god by surprise that's right amen he wasn't taken by surprise and i'm so glad glory see if god didn't know everything that he's not god right right because you know you can't you can't have um one that is uh going to write a a word right that's going that's going to and go all time eternity everything that's going to take place because if he if he didn't know all things and he didn't know how things were going to take place then if he wrote a word then how do you know it's going to be right right right that's right because if he it because if he could be wrong because he didn't know everything right yeah right then he could be wrong but see then if if he was trying to uh say well this is this is going to be it i'm going to write this and this is the way it's going to be yeah but guess what he's forcing us into something right then it's not free moral agents right exactly you're not you're not having the opportunity to to decide for yourself you're being forced into something right but we also see that in the beginning you know that we know that god had attributes that he wanted to display right yeah and and we know by the prophet's message that we know that had there been no fall we'd have still come right man all right all right all right we would have we didn't come in the manifestation whether there had been no fall or not yeah right because there was a certain amount of there were certain attributes that he wanted to display that would have been displayed right that's the reason that in ephesians when when the apostle paul was writing that's the reason that brothers read that scripture so many times did you see that you were chosen in him before the foundation of the world see that was because see he had a an attribute to be displayed that's reason he told the disciples y'all didn't choose me i chose you see he knew what was going to take place and he had a certain amount of of he had these certain attributes that would have been displayed whether it be no fall or not right right but see that wasn't all of the attributes to be displayed right right and so here he is with all the with all with everything that we came into being you know and the fall happened which didn't take god by surprise amen and you know what you can he could have you can have a god that can predestinate doesn't know what's going to happen from then from the beginning and still allow you to make your own choice right it's your choice see you know you're not going to surprise god with a choice that you make he knew it amen they give you all the time in the world you still make the same same choice we had a single we had a church we went two years ago we had a christmas party and they gave out these gifts we all had to go buy stuff you know everybody had to buy a gift rich and i wouldn't bought gifts when we took them to the party and everybody goes through and everybody gets pick a gift and then after you go around i can't remember what you call it anyway everybody gets to pick the gift and you always want to be the last person because after all the gifts opened up you can pick whatever you want well it's just like you go in you go to the store and you'll buy something well i bought what i liked richard bought what he liked you know what we went home with i went home with what i liked what i bought i went home with richard went home with while he went mom said we didn't have to go to the party we just stayed home well you go to the store somebody gives you money say buy what you want it's like well you ought to buy something that you that you would like because you know you figure everybody is going to like that too well everybody else let's pretty much buy another stuff but richard i went home with what we thought because we liked it all right and so you know that's so that's the way god was he had a plan and he knew what he wanted and he knew how to bring it about right so you know here here god is and he gave as the produce he gave every man a thirst every man thirsts for god just like he said at the day of judgment you can't say oh i never thirsted for god yeah yes you did right right but what did you do with that first see many people have tried to as brother rem said uh the devil would try to pervert that thirst sure right sure he said they try to get you to drink from those stagnant cesspools but you have a thirst everybody has a thirst and see it's a wonderful thing to see what what god was able to to do that there's there's no um no way no place to stand yeah you can't because he's he's made it so perfect there's there's no other way that you can do it right and you think here people you know we were able to come in a fallen condition and god was able to display these attributes and you see people that wouldn't would never have ever received eternal life will not receive eternal life right you see there's a there's a foolish virgin that comes in all these other ones that god was able to make display here's here's this beautiful scene that comes you know open because see god god's not just a god of justice he's a god of love glory and here he is able to display himself in such a wonderful way see god god's not trying to uh punish anybody right because see it's it's not going to be god rendering judgment on us one day right it's our sales amen see it doesn't seem because we're we're going to be going to be the ones that are going to stand stand before the white throne of judgment or we're going to have to give an account for the things that we've done in this life so because one of these days we have to give an answer somewhere right one of the two you're going to you're going to give an answer before god for for what you've done right and when you give an answer see it's not going to be god having to stand up and say you've done this and you've done that you're going to know what you've done right and you're going to because you're going to be your own a prosecuting attorney standing before yourself laying it out see because there's nothing hid from god you can't you can't you can hide it from everybody else but you can't hide from god there's nothing hidden from god but when god wants to make this known see god comes searching for us we didn't come looking for god amen see he's the one that put the thirst in you for you to thirst for him see we never we we'd have never thirsted for god we never had a desire for god but he came looking for us because he's the one that made it available to us see as brother adam said and before there was a fish with a fin on his back there had to be water for him to swim and so there was a there was a plan i already made there was a opening for us already made before we came and he knew what was going to take place so when we come in our in this day in the life that we live today he knows everything that was ever going to take place in our lives he knew every time we'd fall every time we'd fail every time we get upset but see the thing is the grace is there sure see the only time there's no grace is when you turn it down right that's right see when you go all the way through the scripture it wasn't god turning the people people away it was people turned god away right see it was you know all the way through the scripture you look at all the prophets moses and jeremiah and each one of them when they come it was he they come and brought the word to him and told him said you left it right jeremiah stand there telling them said you left the living water right right he said you tuned yourself out cisterns that can hold no water he said here's a fountain of living water an artesian whale but he said y'all walked away from it i did exactly he said he didn't he never said the artesian well stopped flowing no no right he said y'all trying to go some other way and here here you are you're thirsting to death right and he said he said y'all left and he keeps trying to call him back to come back to the water glory this this living water it's saying the same thing today the water has been is freely flowing come on gloria but it's up to us to come and drink god i can't don't want to force it on this right exactly see the thing is everything that we have need of as brother and told us everything in this in this life in this earthly journey has been given to us he said when you were born again he said everything that you had need of was given to you amen but he said there was there was one thing that we had to do he said you've got to drink right and you've got to push out see everything that you have native is already here you've received what you had needed the thing is is we'll have to draw from that right and it's available right brother brown was saying in the message thirst yeah somebody get me some water please appreciate that this is from the message starts and brother now many times i meet people that's prone to be a little nervous when they find out that they're they're trying to do something and everything is just blocking it off on both sides they say it might not have might not been the will of the lord say don't let the devil lie to you like that he says first thing is to find out whether it's the will of god or not right then when you want to know whether it's the will of god look into the bible there is the thing that sets you straight is the word of god then if you see that it's the word of god for you to do it like for instance seeking the baptism of the holy ghost many times i run into people and they say well i've sought for the holy ghost and i just couldn't receive it i don't believe it's for me every time i get down i get sick and i go to praying if i fast i get sick and if i try to stay all night stay up i get so sleepy i can't get off my feet remember that is the devil because god intends for you to have the holy ghost it's for whosoever will you know and when we run into people and you know you meet people and they and they have they have it that complex they have that same thing well maybe it's not for me yeah you know they they get into this situation and you know because you know if if it wasn't if it was easy you know why would the devil worry about trying to stop you from it i mean defender was thank you bro if it didn't mean anything that wouldn't bother you about it right but you know you start trying to seek god for something then the devil starts hindering sure especially if it's something that you find in the scripture right because you know you find people that say well you know they don't they don't know if they ought to go to church or not yeah well it's in the scripture right they said well you know you run into you run into problems well don't stop right because if it takes you you know an hour all day whatever don't stop right but you see people that it's like something happens well you know maybe that's not the will of the lord maybe the lord put that in your way to see if you actually had the desire to do it maybe the lord was testing you maybe it's the will of the lord to see if you if you really desires enough to go do it do you have the thirst for it because there is a will is it's not the will of the lord hey it's it's everything's about yeah ma and so everybody's like well you know i try to seek the holy ghost and i just can't get it well the prophet said that he wanted to give it to you more than you wanted amen that's right then how is that if it takes if it takes five minutes 25 years right we ought to keep seeking it amen if we have if we have a question about something if it takes if it takes us all our life we got to keep seeking god for the answer amen that's right you know there's a there's a uh a thing a part where brother speaking in thirst speaking of the baptism of the holy ghost you know he said inside of a man the holy ghost when the word when a man starts preaching that gets off the word he said it'll let you know right exactly because it alarms to you there's something's wrong now he didn't say he'd give you the answer and tell you what was wrong he said he would let you know there was something wrong because you know i've had i've had people preach things and i didn't understand what they were saying but it just there was something in me that was like i didn't understand that there's just like something you just can't get a hold of that it's just like i don't know what's wrong and it took it took years but i finally understand what that was that that god will show you yeah that god would give you an answer he didn't say all right he'd automatically give you an answer just like brother madam said that in every born-again believer there is a measure of deserving of spirit right you have that discernment and so every person because see he said it would deceive in the last days he said it would deceive the very elect if it was possible right he didn't say that you would never get me stopped he never did he never said you never make mistakes but you know what but he would make a way for you to get out right man because you know what you'll never be in that place because if you get if you're wrapped up into something in some doctrine and you stay in it for years and years and years and years and years if the holy ghost is leaving you then why are you still in it right because if he's not going to allow you to stay there then either you're not following him or what's leading you ain't right because if and how and how is it that you have people that can that can sit and listen to the word and say oh this is the greatest thing i've ever heard and can talk about what the lord opening their eyes into the word that they can see things and all of a sudden they can turn around and walk away from it wrong brother amen he said the lord the lord led me here yeah the lord led me here and i can see all these great things and and the lord has opened the word to me and all these and then they can turn around and leave what is that somebody's had a change of desire see somebody's had to turn away from god see they're going after they've got a different thirst see they're they're turning away that's not god because if god can bring you to the word then he's not going to take you away from the word amen and you see these people that they they come under the under the headship of the word and they start walking in the word and all of a sudden they get to a place that they don't go any further they get wrapped up in something and they're gone you know what the fruits by their fruits you'll know i i've yet to find a person that's ever went through something like that that you don't see it it comes in a manifestation in their life and that that goes for all of us it it's it it becomes manifest in our lives see it's not something you can't you can't get away from it and it doesn't matter if it's if it's if it's me or whoever it is because when these things happen it's it's going to be made manifest right see that's the reason that when things happen in your life it's it's time to get it under the blood that's right it's time it's time to make sure that we're right amen you know you don't have we don't have a promise of any other time but today right now you don't you don't have a promise and you look at you look at the what shape of the world is in today i'm glad i'm glad that time is it's not right amen see we didn't i mean how many people here would have believed in their human mind things could get this bad you know some of you have lived a lot longer than i have probably twice as long as i have but how many how many would believe that the world would be in the condition that it's in today how many would have believed that this is the way it was when when the prophet stood here and told us how it would be oh yeah when we knew what was going to take place when we we have been warned right see it's it's a great thing to be standing here and know what's going to take place right right because as the script as the song says on christ the solid rock i stand all other ground is sinking sin right see there's no other place to stand but on the word that's right see we need to see who we are we need to see what our thirst is what is what are you desiring what do you want in this life right because jesus said he said if you if you love the world or the things of the law of the world he said the love of god's not in you he said because there's a because the only thing that that is is the is the word right and you and you can't have you can't have the things of the world and have and have the word too you can't have the things that goes on and have this too all right see that's you can't have both right and that's the condition that many people have found themselves in we're we're being bound by the world we're letting the world bind us and what is it we've allowed the devil to come in and hinder us when we have we're more than conquerors right see jesus jesus didn't have uh didn't uh have any prop problems because when he came he said he walked in a realm of perfect faith jury had he had new human uh emotions he had human feelings he faced sickness he felt sorrow all of these things but yeah here he come and he walked in a realm of perfect faith and here you know because when he walked and he said he said the the power of the prince of the power of this world he said he had nothing in him right see satan couldn't get a hold of him glory because when he come to him and you know when he when he tempted him in the in the in the desert in the wilderness see he as he tried to bring the word to him in a in a messed up way he tried to bring the word to jesus and yet jesus turned around and used the word against him right here he came trying to bring the word and trying to get him to bow down to him he told him to get behind him showing because you know as the prophet said showing that the word was to be used by every believer so we have received the word and the word that's been given to us is what we use to put him behind us right right and then we can see who we are because if we understand who he was who we are because we are more than conquerors if we can understand who we are then we understand see we allow things to overcome us we should let we because we're to all be overcoming them we should be overcoming these things and i'm so glad that god allows us to know who we are and if we can be see who we are then we can see how to overcome because i i don't know who i am amen that's right because i have to know who i am as brother brown speaking of you know there's so many people as he was speaking of the the churches he said you've got one you know the pentecostals had such a had such a great move and understanding but he said you know they didn't have the word and he said you've got some that you know because they were so tall but he said they didn't have the spirit exactly he said you got one that can write a check but they can't cash it right they said you got one that's got money in the bank but they can't write a check right he said you have to know who you are because he said he said you know there's a bank draft of of heaven for you to draw on but the thing is you've got to know who you are to do that to be able to draw from that and if we can if we can draw from that then we can we can overcome and i'm so glad to see that who i am amen not that not that i see all things but but i know that i'm seeing more and more amen because i ca i believe that as the word has opened up we are seeing who we are i can see who i am because i want to know who i am right right because i i don't i don't want to be bound by the things of the world because you know what i've spent i spent too much time being bound by the things of the world i want to overcome i want to i want to know who i am because i want to overcome because i want i want to display i want to display all that god has for me because why because there is an attribute of god i want to be that the display that attribute of god i want to be that walking living breathing manifestation of jesus christ in this day and that's our i want to be what he wants me to be sorry i want to be i want to be under i want to be under the shed blood i want to be crucified right as as paul said to die daily i want to die daily that i can that i no longer there's aaron roberts living but it's jesus christ living in me because i want everybody to see jesus christ amen right man and see i can see i'm so far from that but you know what i still have that desire that's right i still have a long way to go but you know what if we can say but i'm i'm not as far as away as i used to be right right i'm not i'm not what i was what i ought to be and i'm not what i want to be but thank god i'm not what i used to be see that's that's the thing are we are we drawing closer to god are we reaching that fountain are we drawing from that are we getting what we need are we becoming what we what we want to be right because you know we can stand here looking into the mirror of the word are we are we drawing for what we want or as as as david was saying here as the heart panet after the water brooks you know brother remember speaking of that that deer you know that deer just going along doing his thing just living the life of ease until the wolf or the dog or whatever comes after him then when he comes under attack then he said when when he gets when he gets injured he said then he starts looking for water he's got to get to water see it becomes a desperation you know brother brown said that's when god comes on the scene when there's desperation he said you know he gets so that he gets to that water he said then you can't get him away from it he said you can just track him all day long he'll run but he comes right back to the water he runs but he comes right back he never gets away from that water why because as long as he's with that water you can't get to him and see we've got to get to that place because see we wonder why things happen to us that's what god is wanting us to do right we've got to get back to the water we've got to draw from that water we've got to draw that we may live just like that deer are we drawing from the water are we are we desiring that right or do we have some other kind of desire right amen that's that's what i want to know are we desiring what god has for us are you are you desiring what god has are you reaching out to that or is it something else holding you back because i see many things up that holds me back oh yeah yep see i don't you don't ever i don't ever need anybody tell me where i'm wrong you know just like you see you wake up every morning you look in the mirror you know who you are you battle the same thing every day i don't need i don't need anybody to tell me i know but i'm so glad that god don't look on the outside right right but he looks on the inside i'm so glad that he can see what's on what's down on the inside of a man no what's on the outside amen just like just like david out there you know all the brothers with samuel come to anoint them see it was though it was the one that they plum forgot about that's right he was a he was an afterthought when they brought all the other brothers up through there jesse you know and and saying it was like surely you gotta have another one all right and he was like oh yeah i got another one he ain't much but you know what people didn't think that that was the king of israel amen exactly that's what that's what god was looking for tonight that's right it wasn't it wasn't the big brother wonderful looking guys it was that little ruddy that god could see what was on in the inside what was on that young man's heart right and that was what what god desired so yeah i'm so thankful that we have a if you have a thirst then there's a need you know there's something there to meet that first that desire that you have because see it's so sad when you think about it there's a group of people out there with a thirst from god they're thirsting for god but they'll never come to you they feel it with every other thing in the world they try to satisfy it and they can't ever be satisfied right but i'm so thankful that i that i can say i found something amen i've said before if i if i died and went to hell i thank god for what i've seen exactly right for what god has allowed me to see what god has allowed me to be lord amen that's right amen because i have i've seen god move because people say that they want to see they want to see jesus come on i want to see god manifested in flesh come on amen i'm saying i've seen this amen i am amen that's right blessing if i died with the hail i could say i've seen christ manifest today amen that's right there's nothing nothing greater in this world than that to me that's right amen and his brother brother dale said you know this is you've received one thing that he said i've spent my lifetime trying to give away yeah if you just as a you know as the bible says you just you know i have not seen nor heard never entered into the heart of man what god has in store for them that's right you can't you can't you can't explain it the song says it's joy unspeakable and full of glory amen thank you lord amen god bless you let's all stand i'm gonna be short tonight but if you don't have but if you don't have if you have a thirst then you've not met the one that satisfies that thirst that's reason we're here to show you that there is a if you have a desire there's one to meet that desire because many people will spend time out in the world they'll go out and they'll spend money and it's women men money cars drugs alcohol all those things and in the end they're they're more empty than they were when they started and you know it's the old song said the lows are always lower than the hives why because you keep trying to get trying to get trying to get raised up you're trying to you're right you're looking for something to feel that desire and then the end you're lower than you were when you started right and you get you know people all the time trying to reach that high you know drug addicts they're out trying to find that high they go out and they spend and spending and they keep trying to put more and more and more and more and all of a sudden they get to the point see it ends up killing them why because they can't reach that that point that they had one time but i tell you what there is one that you can that you can reach a high with that's right and the next high is higher than that right and guess what it's life and it's more life and it's abundant life glory and it keeps getting you keep going higher and higher and higher you know i've i've had i've had the lord deal with me on things i've been i've been in his presence and i think it can't get any greater than this right and i thought well if it got any greater we'd have to go into rapture yeah and you know what the next time is greater and you think if it got any greater i'd go into rapture something's gonna happen and the next time it happens again and you're like surely we're going to go in the rapture well you know what one of these days we actually all right one of these days we will we're going to see who we are and when we do because i believe we're seeing who we are but there's a place we've got to get to and we get to that place right we're going we're going to walk out of this world yeah i believe it because you know what god has called to us to that right because he didn't call anybody else he called us glory there's nobody else in this world that's been called to a body change but us right right and i thank god for that all right the spiral 6 12. oh me is to you is is you are me is here is he is here is touch him
