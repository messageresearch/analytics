[17:30] during sunday school we're making our
[17:31] way over to melchizedek and
[17:33] in the book of hebrews and uh just want
[17:36] to just speak on that topic tonight
[17:38] and read from hebrews chapter seven
[17:42] and uh
[17:43] let's also when we go to the lord in
[17:44] prayer remember
[17:45] terrance has lost some keys so we're
[17:47] going to pray about that
[17:49] lord god we're so grateful to be able to
[17:51] gather together around your word once
[17:52] more lord jesus and we pray lord that
[17:54] you'll just bless them up in ohio lord
[17:56] as brother wade ministers to them lord
[17:58] and we we know that you're here with us
[18:00] now lord we we you're a prison help in
[18:02] time of trouble in time of need and we
[18:04] know you're with us lord jesus because
[18:06] you said you never forsake us you never
[18:08] leave us lord
[18:09] thank god we've got those promises lord
[18:11] jesus and tonight we've got many needs
[18:13] here and they've got many needs up there

[18:17] around the world and we know you're
[18:18] still present help that can address you
[18:20] can meet every need that we have lord
[18:22] and so we just ask lord that your lord
[18:24] be at liberty to move among us tonight
[18:26] lord jesus and open up this word lord
[18:28] lord maybe tonight lord many things will
[18:30] be said that are that are maybe
[18:32] difficult to understand and difficult to
[18:34] to think about with our intellectual
[18:36] mind lord but lord surely lord you can
[18:38] come down and quicken the words that we
[18:40] read and make them leap off of the page
[18:42] lord and
[18:43] because we believe tonight that we have
[18:45] a we're serving a supernatural god that
[18:47] can do miracles lord and i i think now
[18:49] lord jesus of all the many times lord
[18:51] that you've you've reached out and saved
[18:53] the lost lord and you've you've reached
[18:55] out to the ones that went away from you
[18:56] lord and you've reached out and found
[18:58] things that have been lost lord and all
[19:00] all the different times that i've lost
[19:02] my keys and i've lost things lord jesus
[19:04] i've lost my umbrella and you've found
[19:05] it i've lost so many things lord jesus
[19:08] and many testimonies here to this
[19:10] tonight lord jesus of times that you've
[19:12] found things lord and lord you know
[19:13] where those keys are that terence lost
[19:16] and we're just trusting you lord jesus
[19:18] to put in his mind where they are or
[19:20] just make them appear before him or
[19:22] whatever you whatever you need to do
[19:24] lord because we're serving a miracle
[19:25] working god and we're serving somebody
[19:27] that can we're serving a god that can
[19:29] move up on the scene lord jesus lord we
[19:31] have a need he's got a need tonight lord
[19:33] jesus and i pray god that you'll move up
[19:35] on the scene and address it lord meet
[19:36] that need no
[19:37] now lord we we just ask lord as we join
[19:40] our faith together lord jesus that
[19:41] you'll meet every need here tonight lord
[19:43] god that we'll we'll leave this place
[19:45] lord feeling like you spoke to us lord
[19:47] that we came and we got what we needed
[19:49] lord we ask this blessing upon your word
[19:52] tonight in the name of the lord jesus
[19:54] amen
[19:56] so hebrews chapter 7 says
[20:01] paul talking about talking about
[20:02] melchizedek
[20:05] and he says for this melchizedek king of
[20:07] salem
[20:08] priest of the most high god who met
[20:10] abraham returning from the slaughter of
[20:12] the kings and blessed him
[20:14] to whom also abraham gave a tenth part
[20:17] of all first being by interpretation
[20:19] king of righteousness
[20:20] and after that also king of salem
[20:23] which is king of peace
[20:24] without father without mother without
[20:26] descent having neither beginning of days
[20:28] nor end of life
[20:29] but made like unto the son of god
[20:32] abideth a priest continually you may be
[20:34] seated the lord that is blessing to the
[20:36] reading of the word
[20:39] now if you if you go back and uh
[20:43] paul paul you know when you talk about
[20:44] melchizedek you're you're
[20:47] it's it's it's can be a little bit
[20:49] confusing first of all because there's
[20:51] two places in scripture that refer to
[20:53] god coming and talking to to abraham in
[20:56] the flesh and and and and sitting down
[20:58] with him and talking to him
[21:00] and so a lot of times you know you start
[21:02] talking about melchizedek and you're
[21:04] talking about maybe one or both of those
[21:06] things both of those events
[21:08] at the same time the first time that
[21:09] melchizedek came to talk to to abraham
[21:12] was after
[21:13] abraham had gone to rescue lot and
[21:16] you know the bible talks about so lot
[21:18] was lot was uh abraham's brother's son
[21:22] and abraham heard that that lot he got
[21:25] captured by all of those kings and
[21:28] cheddarly omer and the different ones
[21:30] and he went and go rescue lot and the
[21:32] bible says that when he went to rescue
[21:33] lot he says he heard his brother got
[21:35] captured and you know brother branham
[21:37] would comment about how that
[21:39] you know when you hear when you when you
[21:41] hear a guy it it just wonderful how he
[21:43] referred to him in the scripture as his
[21:44] brother my brother i heard my brother
[21:46] got captured he was his brother's son
[21:48] his nephew but in the scripture it
[21:50] refers to him as his brother and you
[21:51] know whenever you hear about
[21:54] somebody
[21:55] going astray or getting lost you
[21:58] something something in your heart cries
[22:00] out for them to to try to go out and
[22:01] rescue them and so that's what abraham
[22:04] did he got up and he he went after a lot
[22:06] to go to go capture him and the way that
[22:09] brother brown illustrates it is he he
[22:10] would uh he was he was tearing down all
[22:12] the things that would be in somebody's
[22:14] life you he was he went out and
[22:16] with his sword and he began to to to uh
[22:19] to to
[22:20] bring about a deliverance and lots of
[22:22] life and he would brother branham would
[22:24] dramatize it and say he would see he was
[22:25] killing all that all that lust and all
[22:27] the different things that are in
[22:28] people's lives and he he was going after
[22:31] a lot to rescue him
[22:32] and so when he after all that battle you
[22:35] see you go through times where you're
[22:37] battling things out and and like brother
[22:39] wade's been preaching on the life of
[22:40] sanctification when when the holy spirit
[22:43] begins to move in your life and things
[22:44] begin to leave you and but then after
[22:46] the battle is over you're battling it
[22:48] out you're wrestling with it but after
[22:49] the battle is over
[22:50] then then you're able to commune with
[22:53] god and so after the battle was over
[22:55] with with abraham he sat down and he
[22:57] said he said the bible says he sat down
[22:59] with all these different kings with the
[23:01] the king of sodom and all the all the
[23:03] different kings that had fought with him
[23:04] and and he sat down and but you know
[23:06] here come this one king
[23:08] uh the
[23:09] the king of salem
[23:11] which we know is jerusalem and the king
[23:13] of salem
[23:14] rolled up straight up uh walked up and
[23:17] and sat down and he brought bread and
[23:19] wine and sat down with abraham and they
[23:21] had communion and you know later on in
[23:24] the story you find out that after
[23:25] abraham had gone through some more
[23:27] struggles and god had brought him gave
[23:29] him a promise of a son that you find out
[23:31] that that that man walked up to abraham
[23:33] and he had two men with him and he was
[23:34] walking up those three men and abraham
[23:36] walks up and this time abraham looked at
[23:39] him and he said i know who that man is
[23:45] because i've had communion with him
[23:47] i know who he
[23:48] is you see
[23:50] when you and brother animal lay out in
[23:52] this sermon who is this melchizedek that
[23:54] every every son of god and this in this
[23:56] age is going to go through the same
[23:58] journey that abraham did it's got to
[24:00] play out the same thing that you've got
[24:02] to you got to meet melchizedek as well
[24:05] and how are you going to meet him you're
[24:06] going to meet him in the flesh and you
[24:08] see
[24:10] now brother brown said to think of this
[24:12] great person this great question this
[24:14] great question this that that arose all
[24:16] down through history who was this man
[24:18] that came to meet abraham think of this
[24:20] great person brother i'm said of how
[24:22] great this man must be and now the
[24:24] question is who is this man
[24:27] who's this man and how does he relate to
[24:29] jesus christ who was this man and how
[24:30] does he relate to god what role does he
[24:32] have he came he came to it is it just
[24:34] like he had it he was fulfilling the
[24:36] role of a priesthood or or is he is he a
[24:38] person that we need to know about
[24:40] and see when you when this when this
[24:42] story begins to unfold you begin to the
[24:44] picture begins to unfold
[24:46] of of really how god expresses himself
[24:49] and god's god's attributes being on
[24:51] display and how god moves and how what
[24:54] how god would manifest himself in this
[24:56] day
[24:57] brother brown would say some say it was
[24:58] a myth it was a priesthood and you know
[25:00] because they many people could not could
[25:03] not identify who is this milk who
[25:05] melchizedek is and
[25:07] it seems like so many times down through
[25:09] scripture and down through store down
[25:10] through the seven church ages when god
[25:12] moves on the scene people cannot people
[25:15] don't realize what's happening and they
[25:17] they don't realize who that is that's
[25:19] that's talking to who that is that's
[25:21] moving on the scene how they didn't
[25:22] realize when when the pillar of fire was
[25:24] taken with brother branham they didn't
[25:26] realize that who that was speaking
[25:28] through him when he's when he would say
[25:30] this isn't this isn't william branham
[25:32] this is i'm the one that raised christ
[25:34] from the grave and actually spoke out
[25:36] through hit that man's lips and they
[25:38] failed to recognize that this message
[25:40] that we're hearing is not just some kind
[25:42] of denominational idea but it's direct
[25:45] from the throne of god so brother rahm
[25:47] said it was a person
[25:49] it was a man a personality an eternal
[25:52] person so you know when you start
[25:54] thinking about a personality you the the
[25:56] the the world has got the godhead all
[25:59] mixed up because they
[26:00] like that jew that brother man was
[26:02] talking to he said you can't take god
[26:04] and slice him up into three pieces and
[26:06] and hand him to a jew that just won't
[26:09] work because a jew understands that
[26:10] there's only one god
[26:12] but you see you see what if you begin to
[26:14] understand that god god
[26:17] who was this who was this melchizedek
[26:19] answers that question how does he relate
[26:21] to jesus and how does he relate to you
[26:23] how does he relate to those those
[26:24] believers on the day of pentecost when
[26:26] god put his life in them you see it's
[26:29] always one personality and when you you
[26:32] begin to understand that god it can
[26:34] manifest himself in different ways and
[26:36] express himself in different ways
[26:37] express himself in a pillar of fire
[26:39] express himself from the man christ
[26:41] jesus express himself in the body of
[26:43] believers but it's always one
[26:45] personality when his life begins to
[26:47] express in you that one personality
[26:50] begin
[26:50] begins to take over your life and your
[26:53] life and your works and your actions and
[26:55] your doings begin to express that same
[26:57] personality because there's not three
[26:59] gods it's not three god it's not a
[27:02] father and a son and a holy ghost
[27:03] dueling one another you know when you
[27:05] have when you have a a a person
[27:08] everybody in this room tonight everybody
[27:10] in this building has a different
[27:11] personality so if we were to ask you how
[27:13] would you how would you run your family
[27:15] how would you run a job how would you
[27:16] run a business how would you run the
[27:18] church everybody's going to have their
[27:20] own ideas and their own opinions
[27:22] because we're each different
[27:23] personalities so you see what chaos that
[27:26] would be if the father son and holy
[27:28] ghost were all different personalities
[27:29] they wouldn't be able to agree with one
[27:31] another because they've all got
[27:32] different personalities that's even why
[27:34] brother ramsey said god sends up one
[27:36] prophet at the time one one messenger at
[27:38] a time because
[27:40] one might
[27:41] want to do things a little bit different
[27:43] just because of their nature their
[27:45] characteristic because they're a
[27:46] personality and so you you if you if you
[27:49] if you have a concept of god of three
[27:52] different people or three different
[27:53] personalities your concept of god is all
[27:55] skewed but what a freedom it gives
[27:58] tonight as we're sitting here to know
[28:00] that if god is one god and he has one
[28:03] personality that if that personality can
[28:05] be manifest was manifest in jesus christ
[28:08] and in the pillar of fire and in brother
[28:09] branham's life and that man that
[28:11] personality is manifested in your life
[28:13] it will act the same way and do the same
[28:15] thing he said that's why he said he he
[28:18] gave he gave power to the church to cast
[28:20] out devils and power to do signs and
[28:22] wonders and power to live a christian
[28:23] life because why because it's the same
[28:26] personality the same person living in
[28:29] you that lived in jesus christ the same
[28:30] person that lived in jesus christ lived
[28:32] in was in that pillar of fire because
[28:34] and you see that's the mystery of of of
[28:36] melchizedek unfolding that there was a
[28:38] life behind that flesh that came and
[28:40] talked to abraham
[28:42] there was a that was a person a person
[28:44] the same personality that's manifested
[28:46] all throughout the scripture was the one
[28:48] that came and talked to abraham
[28:50] now brother brahma said he was god
[28:52] because he's the only person that can be
[28:54] immortal and now god changing god
[28:57] changing himself
[28:58] into person now that's why i think i
[29:01] love this sermon who is this melchizedek
[29:03] because it's got some wonderful nuggets
[29:05] like this one
[29:06] god changing himself into person in
[29:08] other words god god manifesting himself
[29:10] changing his mask to display himself in
[29:13] different ways at different times to
[29:15] different people changing his mask so
[29:17] that you know maybe maybe you meet god
[29:20] one day veiled in a little sister
[29:22] failing a little brother that sits down
[29:24] and talks to you about the scripture
[29:25] maybe maybe you meet god when you turn
[29:27] on listen to the tape and and the and
[29:29] the voice of god echoes to you through
[29:32] the tape player or the mp3 player or
[29:34] whatever it is and you're listening
[29:36] though it's coming through the mouth of
[29:38] clay lips of clay but it's the voice of
[29:40] god that same personality
[29:43] and brother adam said we find that many
[29:45] people teach us three personalities in
[29:46] the godhead so you can i have a
[29:48] personality with without being a person
[29:50] it takes a person to make a personality
[29:52] and what is a person a personality is
[29:54] the combination of characteristics of
[29:57] qualities that form an individual's
[30:00] distinctive character in other words
[30:02] your personality is what makes you who
[30:03] you are your personality is the
[30:06] temperance that that controls when
[30:08] somebody smacks you in the face or spits
[30:10] at you your personality is the is the
[30:12] virtue that can flow out of you that
[30:14] it's not just stopped up like the water
[30:16] flowing into the dead sea until it
[30:17] becomes dead but it actually actually
[30:19] there's life within you that you have a
[30:21] past that you can pass it out to
[30:23] somebody else see i'm talking about the
[30:25] same personality that was in jesus
[30:27] christ can be on display today the same
[30:30] the same godliness that was in jesus
[30:32] christ the same brotherly kindness all
[30:35] those things make up the personality of
[30:37] jesus christ and so you see what the
[30:39] statue of a perfect man does that it's
[30:41] actually expressing outwardly what god
[30:43] did inwardly to you through the new
[30:45] birth the statue of perfect man is his
[30:47] works on display that something happened
[30:50] on the inside and something is being
[30:52] expressed the expressed image of his
[30:54] person
[30:55] we found out brother brown said that
[30:56] this person had no mother no no father
[30:59] no mother no beginning of days or ending
[31:01] of life it was god
[31:03] in morphia
[31:05] in morphe so now we're starting to begin
[31:07] to understand the traits of god and the
[31:09] characteristics of god that god can get
[31:11] god can display himself in a lot of
[31:13] different ways
[31:16] now i looked up the definition of morphe
[31:19] online from philippians chapter two
[31:22] and and somebody said i don't even
[31:23] remember where i got this from it was a
[31:25] website
[31:26] they it was i thought it was a pretty
[31:28] good definition they said english
[31:30] doesn't have any any any exact
[31:32] equivalent of morphe
[31:34] uh uh this is maybe one ex one area
[31:36] where it would be nice if you could read
[31:38] the original hebrew and really get to
[31:40] really get what what or the original
[31:43] greek
[31:44] but it says unlike unlike form in
[31:46] english
[31:47] morphe doesn't mean shape
[31:50] it's a philosophical term
[31:52] that means the outward expression
[31:54] of an inner essence
[31:56] to put on display so you can see what's
[31:58] what's taken what's taking place by
[32:01] maybe behind the veil like like for
[32:03] example jesus said no man can know the
[32:05] father except except through the son no
[32:07] man can know him except through me in
[32:09] other words he was the he was the
[32:10] outward display of of what all the
[32:14] things that make up that we'll say
[32:15] unknowable god the mysterious god that
[32:18] the things how how would you know what
[32:20] god's purpose was how would you know
[32:22] what his what his plan was what was in
[32:24] the back part of his mind all the things
[32:25] that he had thought about all the all of
[32:28] his great plan except god had expressed
[32:30] himself
[32:31] through the word had in morphine himself
[32:34] and you see when god and morphs himself
[32:36] he changes his mask so that what's
[32:38] what's behind that veil what you cannot
[32:40] see he puts it on this play
[32:43] see now when god this when god begins to
[32:45] immorphy when he had morphed himself in
[32:47] jesus christ when he had morphed himself
[32:49] in melchizedek we'll go back to
[32:50] melchizedek when he had morphed himself
[32:52] in melchizedek and he put himself on
[32:54] this place so now he could come down and
[32:56] fellowship with abraham and and that
[32:58] unknowable god the god that was past
[33:01] finding out now abraham's sitting there
[33:03] having having a talk with him and eating
[33:06] bread and wine and fellowshipping with
[33:07] him and the same thing when when the
[33:09] when uh all the pharisees and sadducees
[33:12] had no idea what god really wanted what
[33:14] their purpose was in life but then god
[33:16] and morphed himself in jesus christ and
[33:18] came down in a little manger and put
[33:20] himself on this play and now he could
[33:22] sit there and wash people's feet he
[33:24] could sit there and have communion with
[33:26] him he could die on a cross and now that
[33:29] unknowable god is on display and what he
[33:32] had thought before the foundation of the
[33:33] world begins to be displayed you see
[33:36] what a morphe means is that it's the
[33:38] expression of something something that
[33:41] you can't understand and when it's
[33:43] expressed you begin to be able to
[33:45] understand it that's why philippians
[33:47] chapter 2 where this word in morphe
[33:48] comes from says who being in the form of
[33:52] god
[33:53] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[33:56] god
[33:57] he was in the form of god and what does
[33:59] that mean that means he was the very
[34:01] expression of god the very image of god
[34:04] god put on display so that you would
[34:06] know who god is so that you could
[34:09] understand god but made himself of no
[34:12] reputation and took upon him the form of
[34:15] a servant so he was be he was in the
[34:17] form of god but he lowered himself down
[34:20] to be the form of a servant to come down
[34:22] and be made a a little baby and a manger
[34:25] and the bible says and made in the
[34:27] likeness of men and being found in
[34:29] fashion as a man he humbled himself and
[34:32] became obedient unto death even the
[34:34] death of the cross
[34:36] now brother brown said the greek word
[34:37] there in morphy means that one person is
[34:40] changing his mask
[34:42] to make him some other character
[34:45] now he's not changing his character
[34:47] but he's making himself some other
[34:49] character he's changed in his mask you
[34:51] ever see one one of those uh maybe a
[34:54] collage of an actor that's been in a
[34:56] movie a lot of movies and stuff and and
[34:57] it shows how that in one movie or
[34:59] whatever they were they were a pirate
[35:01] and another they were sophisticated
[35:03] businessman with a pal with a tie on and
[35:05] every see they're they're changing
[35:07] they're changing the the portrayal and
[35:09] and see that's exactly how god can
[35:12] portray him he can he can then morphe
[35:14] himself he can display his attributes in
[35:17] a business man at work and a minister
[35:19] behind the pulpit and
[35:21] a little child has just received a new
[35:23] birth he can put himself and put him on
[35:25] display just like he came down and
[35:27] displayed himself and morphed himself
[35:30] in melchizedek and morphed himself and
[35:33] put him on display the fullness of the
[35:35] godhead bodily in jesus christ and in
[35:38] morphing himself again in this last day
[35:40] in the bride who will be the fullness of
[35:42] god made made visible made visible among
[35:45] the people yet again
[35:47] so as a morphe means to to change his
[35:50] mask and brother brown said that's what
[35:51] god did it's the same god
[35:53] all the time
[35:55] it's the same god all the time the same
[35:58] personality you think about that in
[36:01] every home tonight in every christian
[36:03] home and every every church where the
[36:05] there's a real god called minister
[36:06] preaching there's real god called people
[36:08] preaching listening to the services it's
[36:10] the same personality working in them
[36:13] it's the same god moving in them it's
[36:15] the same god all the time god in the
[36:18] form of the father the spirit the pillar
[36:20] of fire the same god was made flesh and
[36:22] dwelt among us and morph he brought out
[36:24] so he could be seen
[36:27] brought out so he could be seen now i
[36:29] maybe want to bring that home tonight
[36:31] because when when he puts himself his
[36:33] life in you and you go into the into the
[36:36] workplace with your little lunch pail
[36:38] and your little your little uh
[36:40] you get your your your food out at lunch
[36:43] time and you begin to pray over it where
[36:44] everybody else is laughing at you and
[36:46] and mocking you that that is god on
[36:48] display made visible so that others can
[36:52] look at your life and look at the
[36:53] personality of your life and look at the
[36:55] characteristics of your life because and
[36:58] know that you're serving god and and it
[37:00] actually puts and the unseen god on
[37:03] display you think about how great that
[37:05] is that god allows us to play a role he
[37:08] allows us to preach the gospel
[37:10] where he maybe could just come down with
[37:12] a trumpet and just
[37:14] and everybody would believe but he
[37:16] allows us all to play a role in it
[37:19] the pillar of fire the same god was made
[37:21] flesh and dwelt among us and morph he
[37:22] brought out so he could be seen and now
[37:24] that same god that same god is the holy
[37:28] ghost
[37:29] that same god is the holy ghost
[37:32] so you see now there's there's the
[37:34] there's there's why that's so under
[37:36] important to understand melchizedek who
[37:38] was that melchizedek because if you can
[37:40] understand melchizedek you can
[37:42] understand how god how god uh displays
[37:45] himself and how his attributes are
[37:47] manifested
[37:48] and brotherhood will say now notice like
[37:50] the sculpture he hides with a mask over
[37:52] it and look see what god does he he he
[37:55] puts them he he fails things he fails it
[37:57] so you
[37:58] you don't quite understand it and then
[37:59] he removes the veil
[38:01] see he said it's like a sculptor keeping
[38:03] his piece of work all covered over until
[38:05] the time he takes the mask off of it and
[38:07] there it is and that's what the bible
[38:09] has been it has been a work of god
[38:11] that's been covered up god and morphing
[38:13] himself masking himself acting in
[38:16] different characters moving in different
[38:18] people down through history it's been a
[38:21] work of god that's been covered up and
[38:23] it's been hid since the foundation of
[38:24] the world and its sevenfold mystery
[38:27] and god promised in this day at the age
[38:30] of this laodicean church he would take
[38:32] the mask off the whole thing and we
[38:35] could see it what a glorious thing
[38:38] so now if he takes the mask off and
[38:40] takes the mask of the characters and
[38:42] everything and takes the mask off then
[38:44] what are you going to see you're going
[38:45] to see the one that's moving behind the
[38:47] mask you're going to be able to see the
[38:50] personality and the characteristics and
[38:51] the character of that one who's been
[38:53] behind the mask all along it it hadn't
[38:56] been it hadn't been brother bob or
[38:58] brother wade or go through all the
[38:59] church all the different ones sitting
[39:01] here but it's the one that's behind the
[39:03] mask doing it moving it's it's his
[39:05] characteristics and his personality
[39:07] moving in the church so that's why
[39:09] brother brown said that was god above us
[39:12] god with us now is god in us the holy
[39:15] spirit not the third person but the same
[39:18] person
[39:19] the same person all the time the same
[39:22] personality the same characteristics the
[39:24] same god
[39:26] now
[39:27] he said in the beginning god went along
[39:29] with his attributes as i spoke of this
[39:30] morning so that's what that's what
[39:32] melchizedek was doing he was expressing
[39:34] those attributes that god thought of an
[39:36] attribute
[39:38] think about god existing alone elohim
[39:40] with his attributes elohim back before
[39:43] time eternal
[39:44] sitting there with his attributes and
[39:46] alone and and he wanted to put those on
[39:48] display see that's what melchizedek was
[39:51] that's what jesus christ was that's what
[39:53] the holy ghost is for to manifest the
[39:55] attributes that god thought about before
[39:57] the foundation of the world he said in
[39:59] the beginning god dwelt along with his
[40:01] attributes as i spoke of this morning
[40:02] that's his thoughts
[40:04] there was nothing just god alone but he
[40:06] had thoughts
[40:08] he said now in the beginning god dwelt
[40:10] along with his attributes as i spoke
[40:12] with i already read that quote i
[40:14] duplicated that in my nose
[40:19] he said
[40:20] just like a great architect can sit down
[40:23] in his mind and draw out what he thinks
[40:25] he's going to build now you think about
[40:28] god the great architect sitting back and
[40:30] in his mind it never had a new thought
[40:32] never had something that just popped in
[40:34] his idea in his mind he thought well
[40:36] that would be a great idea but his eye
[40:38] his eye his thoughts are eternal so he's
[40:40] he's got all these thoughts and they
[40:42] need to be expressed and what are these
[40:44] thoughts these thoughts are i'm going to
[40:46] have a bride one day and part of that
[40:47] bride there's going to be ministers and
[40:49] there's going to be people sitting in
[40:50] the pew and they're going to go out in
[40:52] the workplace and they're going to
[40:53] manifest my life and and all of that
[40:55] just all that sitting in his mind
[40:58] waiting to be unfolded like an architect
[41:00] ready to build a house
[41:01] think about all these things that we
[41:03] preach we're in the mind of god that
[41:05] there's going to be there's going to be
[41:06] people that are lost and they need a
[41:08] redeemer i'm going to come and die for
[41:09] myself die for them and give my life for
[41:11] them and get fill them with the holy
[41:13] ghost and and they're going to need a
[41:14] way out and and i'm going to preach i'm
[41:16] going to i'm going to send i'm going to
[41:18] send the the recipe for how to get out
[41:20] and that's for them to receive the word
[41:22] for their day and they grow and grow
[41:24] until until finally they bust out of
[41:26] this of this realm like busting an eagle
[41:29] busting out of an eggshell and they're
[41:31] raptured away and so all of that is in
[41:33] god's mind and it needs to be expressed
[41:36] see that's what melchizedek is doing
[41:39] see why we need to understand about
[41:41] melchizedek now
[41:42] melchizedek is the expression of a we'll
[41:45] say a transcendent god
[41:47] and i transcended transcendent means
[41:49] beyond or above the range of normal or
[41:51] merely physical human experience
[41:53] existing apart from and not
[41:55] subject to the limitations of the
[41:57] material universe
[41:59] and i say that because isaiah in chapter
[42:01] 40 he said it is he that sitteth upon
[42:03] the circle of the earth and the
[42:04] inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers
[42:07] that stretcheth out the heavens as a
[42:09] curtain and spreadeth them out as a tent
[42:11] to dwell in how could how could we
[42:13] understand a god like that how could we
[42:16] understand all those things that
[42:18] uh
[42:19] isaiah chapter 55 says for my thoughts
[42:21] are not your thoughts neither are your
[42:23] ways my way saith the lord it's we're
[42:25] like little grasshoppers little ants in
[42:27] his sight how can we understand a god
[42:29] like that
[42:31] he's got all these thoughts and they
[42:33] need to be expressed in jeremiah chapter
[42:35] 23 it says can any hide himself in
[42:37] secret places that i shall not see him
[42:39] saith the lord
[42:40] did not i feel heaven and earth saith
[42:42] the lord how how
[42:44] with our little grasshopper minds can we
[42:46] understand a god like that but if it's
[42:48] expressed if god can come down and
[42:50] manifest himself
[42:52] through the man jesus christ and humble
[42:54] himself in a little stable and go
[42:55] through all the preach the word in a way
[42:57] that we can understand it and grasp it
[42:59] then we can begin to then we our mind
[43:01] can be shaped so that we begin to think
[43:03] like he thinks and we can begin to have
[43:05] his thoughts
[43:07] a thought when it's expressed because i
[43:10] thought when it's expressed
[43:12] is a word
[43:13] so i can have a thought i can have a
[43:15] thought and when i speak it it becomes
[43:17] it's a word now that you can understand
[43:19] and it because it becomes it comes
[43:21] something you can grab a hold to
[43:23] er
[43:24] and you think that's why that's why the
[43:26] bible says in the beginning was the word
[43:27] because the word was the actual
[43:29] expression of that of that thought that
[43:32] how could we how could we approach to
[43:34] that how could we understand it it was
[43:35] in the uh hidden in the mind of god in
[43:38] the back part of god's mind all these
[43:40] things that god wanted to accomplish but
[43:42] then he expressed it he expressed it
[43:44] when that logos came out exp the logos
[43:46] came out in a body that you could begin
[43:48] to you could begin to understand because
[43:50] he's descending down a thought expressed
[43:53] is a word but it has to be a thought
[43:54] first
[43:55] so it's god's attribute then it becomes
[43:57] a thought
[43:59] then a word
[44:01] and that's where that's where tonight
[44:03] sitting here if the personality and the
[44:04] characteristics of god are manifested in
[44:06] your life right now and god has filled
[44:09] you with the holy ghost then that's
[44:10] proof that before the foundation of the
[44:12] world
[44:13] before
[44:14] before
[44:16] everything that god thought about you
[44:19] that i think that's something that
[44:21] should make every every child of god
[44:22] rejoice to know that
[44:24] you know we sing the songs about how
[44:26] when he was on the cross we were on his
[44:27] mind but you were on his mind a whole
[44:30] lot before that way longer than before
[44:32] that
[44:34] you were
[44:35] you were always on his mind
[44:38] so you know his attributes are eternal
[44:40] so that means he always thought about
[44:43] you
[44:44] he knew that one day you were going to
[44:46] accept it and he always loved you he
[44:49] loves you because of that he always knew
[44:51] that one day you were going to have
[44:53] eternal life and so now that paints the
[44:55] picture now in the grand scheme of
[44:56] things that means you always were
[44:58] eternal now we know you dip down into
[45:01] time and you came down here and you were
[45:02] lost and all those things but brother
[45:04] ramsay said if you have eternal life you
[45:06] always was
[45:08] you always was those who have now you
[45:11] see we're taking a step back and looking
[45:12] at the 10 000 foot view
[45:14] you always were because god before the
[45:16] foundational world knew that you were
[45:18] going to receive it
[45:19] those who have denied eternal life was
[45:21] with him and in him in his thinking
[45:23] before there ever was an angel
[45:25] before there ever was a star
[45:28] you look up in the night sky and think
[45:29] before any of those stars were there
[45:33] before any constellation before any
[45:35] universe rolled off of the finger of god
[45:38] before anything that i can see in the
[45:40] night sky was there i was in his
[45:42] thinking
[45:44] that's eternal
[45:46] you think about the thought of god that
[45:48] brother around would say that there
[45:49] can't be a flea badass eyes but what he
[45:51] knowed it he knows everything and that
[45:54] means he knew you
[45:55] he knew you
[45:57] he knowed it before there ever was a
[45:58] world how many times a flea would bat
[46:01] its eyes and how much tallow it had in
[46:03] it before there ever was a world that is
[46:05] infinite
[46:06] we can't comprehend it in our minds but
[46:09] that's god
[46:10] and that god thought about you before
[46:12] the foundation of the world that god had
[46:15] a thought about you that had to be
[46:17] expressed he was thinking about you and
[46:19] that had to be expressed he said your
[46:21] eyes
[46:22] your stature
[46:24] you think about that i i want you to
[46:26] just really dwell on that that
[46:28] maybe tonight you don't like the way you
[46:30] look or the way that you act or you
[46:32] don't you wish you were taller or
[46:33] shorter or whatever but god thought
[46:35] about you before the foundation of the
[46:37] world he knew what color eyes you would
[46:39] have he knew how tall you would be he
[46:41] said your stature whatever you was you
[46:43] were in his thinking at the beginning
[46:45] and the only thing that you are
[46:47] is the expression
[46:49] word
[46:51] right now sitting here if you're filled
[46:53] with the holy ghost that you are the
[46:54] expression of god's attribute that
[46:56] attribute that he thought and he said
[46:58] after he saw that he spoke it
[47:00] this is another nugget i love out of
[47:02] this message think about this after he
[47:04] thought it he spoke it
[47:07] and here you are
[47:11] after he thought he spoke and here you
[47:12] are
[47:14] now he spoke the worlds of existence
[47:16] and the son of man when he was
[47:17] manifested on earth when he came on
[47:19] earth and was born in a stable grew up
[47:21] and he preached the gospel and he he's
[47:23] spoken
[47:24] and i see every everything that we're
[47:26] preaching we're preaching what he spoke
[47:29] so then maybe one day you were sitting
[47:31] in a church and you heard a minister
[47:32] speak the word
[47:34] and you accepted it
[47:36] and there you are because it was spoken
[47:39] into existence and brother adam said you
[47:41] were there in his attributes you don't
[47:43] remember it because you're just a part
[47:44] of his life you're a part of god when
[47:47] you become a son or daughter of god just
[47:49] as you are a part of your earthly father
[47:51] that's right you are the male carries
[47:54] the hemoglobin the blood and when that
[47:55] has gone in the egg then you become a
[47:57] part of your father
[47:59] and your mother is a part of your father
[48:01] so you're all a part of your father
[48:04] now you see where brother adam's going
[48:06] with this as he lays this out he's
[48:07] talking he's beginning to lay out this
[48:10] pattern that we're all part of one body
[48:13] we're all part of this one thing we're
[48:16] all part of the father we're part of him
[48:20] we're part of him and he's in us and and
[48:22] we all just get consumed one together
[48:24] in oneness and that that makes see we've
[48:26] got all these attributes attributes that
[48:28] god thought of a redeemer and savior and
[48:31] counselor and prince of peace and
[48:32] everlasting father and mighty god of
[48:35] deacons and ministers and prayer
[48:36] warriors and homemakers and lunch box
[48:38] carriers and song leaders and worshipers
[48:40] and all those things were in god's mind
[48:42] that he needs he wants to manifest
[48:45] maybe maybe this afternoon just think
[48:47] that god before the foundation of the
[48:49] world had a picture of you how you would
[48:51] be and how you would see it and what
[48:53] church you would go to and he also had a
[48:54] picture he had a picture in his mind
[48:56] that thought of you overcoming the devil
[49:00] you overcoming everything that the devil
[49:02] can throw at you you could overcome in
[49:04] the pride of life and the lust of the
[49:06] flesh and uh uh
[49:07] young people overcoming pornography and
[49:10] instagram addiction and overcoming
[49:12] alcoholism and cigarette smoking and
[49:14] then as you grow up and grow in grace
[49:16] and knowledge you're overcoming
[49:18] overcoming everything that the devil can
[49:20] throw at you and god thought about that
[49:22] before the foundation of the world
[49:25] because you were one of his thoughts
[49:28] in every age every age those thoughts
[49:30] are manifested which is why in first
[49:32] timothy it says that thou keep this
[49:33] commandment without spot unrebukable
[49:35] under the appearing of our lord jesus
[49:37] christ which in his times
[49:39] he shall show
[49:40] in his time he's going to make those man
[49:42] attributes manifested
[49:44] who is the blessed and only potentate
[49:47] and here's here's the third title of
[49:49] this melchizedek the king of salem the
[49:51] king of righteousness
[49:53] and it says here in 1st timothy the king
[49:55] of kings
[49:56] and lord of lords
[49:59] why because this time
[50:00] it's time for the attributes of god to
[50:02] be manifested
[50:03] the attributes of god are put are all
[50:05] put on display when you're filled with
[50:07] the holy ghost you're ma actually
[50:09] manifesting the life of god so brother
[50:11] adam said then the attribute was first
[50:13] god
[50:14] the thought the attribute itself all in
[50:16] one without being expressed
[50:18] then when he expressed secondarily
[50:21] he became then the word
[50:23] and then the word was made flesh and
[50:26] dwelt among us
[50:28] his first being was spirit god
[50:30] supernatural all right the great eternal
[50:32] second he began to form himself
[50:35] toward flesh
[50:37] in a theophany it's called the word
[50:40] a body
[50:42] and brother adam said this then
[50:45] is the state he was in
[50:47] when he met abraham
[50:49] was called melchizedek
[50:51] so that's how he came to abraham the
[50:53] expression of all the attributes of god
[50:56] come down to sit with abraham and have
[50:59] communion
[51:00] and talk to him and show him things you
[51:02] know the second time that
[51:04] that melchizedek came to abraham he sat
[51:06] down and lingered with him and stood
[51:08] over on the hill and washed and they
[51:10] talked about sodom and gomorrah and he
[51:12] and he said i believe that he was
[51:14] lingering with him until he really
[51:15] caught the revelation of what was taking
[51:18] place and i believe that when god comes
[51:20] down it came down in this age and and
[51:22] manifested himself that he he what he
[51:24] he's he's wanting to wait on you and i
[51:27] to catch the revelation he he he he's
[51:30] lingering with us
[51:32] he
[51:32] that's that's what he's doing as he
[51:34] moves through our midst and you think
[51:36] about abraham who was poor and and
[51:38] spiritually poor but spiritually rich
[51:42] and he was looking for a new jerusalem
[51:44] and here came the king of that new
[51:46] jerusalem
[51:48] and he met melchizedek after the
[51:50] slaughter of the kings and had communion
[51:52] with him
[51:53] and blessed him that had been delivered
[51:55] of his enemies
[51:57] now brother ram said a theophany
[51:59] is something that you cannot see
[52:02] now theophany is something you can't see
[52:05] he said it could be here right what's
[52:07] now what's he talking about behind your
[52:09] flesh
[52:10] behind jesus flesh behind melchizedek's
[52:13] flesh
[52:14] something something working
[52:16] something moving
[52:18] he said it could be here right now you
[52:20] cannot see it
[52:22] it's just like well like television
[52:23] that's in another dimension
[52:26] there's another dimension that can be
[52:27] seen by transformation
[52:30] by television
[52:32] and he said so is it that christ is here
[52:34] the angels of god are here and someday
[52:36] in the great millennium to come it'll be
[52:38] just more real than television or
[52:41] anything else because they are here
[52:44] that's something i think sometimes it's
[52:46] kind of hard for us to grasp that that
[52:48] there are angels here there's there's a
[52:50] supernatural world here that's actually
[52:52] moving among us right now you know in
[52:55] one place brother brown talked about how
[52:56] you never you see it and sometimes in a
[52:58] in like a camp meeting or something
[53:00] where people really become conscious of
[53:01] the presence of god
[53:03] and he said in one place you'll bump up
[53:05] against an angel
[53:07] and it'll cause a reaction in this
[53:08] dimension
[53:09] somebody will begin to rejoice and
[53:11] scream and shout because they bumped up
[53:13] against an angel
[53:15] you you think even right now there's
[53:17] angels moving among us there's something
[53:20] something behind beyond what we can see
[53:22] with our natural eyes
[53:24] and so brother brown said he reveals
[53:26] himself in his great form of what he
[53:28] claimed as he had morphed himself into
[53:30] his servants and prove himself
[53:32] now he appeared to abraham and morphy
[53:34] when abraham was returning from the
[53:36] slaughter of the kings here come a
[53:38] melchizedek talk to him
[53:41] now see there's when you die you you die
[53:43] you leave this body behind but but yet
[53:46] there's something behind this flesh
[53:48] there's power in this flesh
[53:50] you think what a what a miraculous thing
[53:52] it is to to to be able to move your hand
[53:54] like this and move your eyeballs and
[53:56] think thoughts and everything because
[53:58] there's more than just this flesh this
[54:00] body there's something behind this flesh
[54:02] that's moving it that's powering it so
[54:04] when you die
[54:06] you're gonna go somewhere
[54:08] you know brother i'm told that story in
[54:10] in in this in this sermon he told a
[54:12] ghost story believe it or not brother
[54:14] man told a ghost story he told a story
[54:17] about he said the other day in the
[54:18] tucson paper he was reading about this
[54:20] woman that was going down the highway at
[54:22] so many miles an hour and a man in an
[54:24] overcase stepped out and she had an old
[54:26] man with an overcoat on
[54:27] and she screamed and stopped her car and
[54:29] there wasn't nobody there and everybody
[54:31] come around and said well years ago
[54:33] there was a man
[54:35] that had an overcut on and he got killed
[54:36] he got struck by a car and he was using
[54:39] that as an example to prove that that
[54:41] there's a life behind the flesh
[54:44] there's a life behind there's something
[54:46] working behind the veil of this flesh
[54:49] that's why in second corinthians chapter
[54:51] five it says for we know that if our
[54:53] earthly house
[54:55] at this house of this tabernacle were
[54:57] dissolved
[54:59] we've got a building of god
[55:01] and house not made with hands eternal in
[55:03] the heavens
[55:05] for in this we groan earnestly desiring
[55:08] to be clothed upon
[55:10] with our house which is from heaven
[55:13] so he's talking about when you die
[55:15] you're you're going to go somewhere
[55:17] there's going to be a body that you're
[55:19] in
[55:20] and don't get nervous that makes people
[55:22] nervous when you start talking about
[55:23] body
[55:26] i thank god that we can i believe we can
[55:28] nail those things down and we have the
[55:30] correct interpretation
[55:33] you see the theophany
[55:35] the word
[55:36] the expression of god's being was masked
[55:39] in melchizedek it was hidden behind that
[55:42] man melchizedek it was hidden
[55:44] that word the theophany it was hidden
[55:47] behind the flesh of jesus christ
[55:50] the theophany the theophany of god the
[55:53] word is hidden it's veiled he said from
[55:56] the great beginning spirit then came
[55:58] down to the word bringing itself out the
[56:00] word doesn't yet make itself
[56:02] it's just spoke out it's always spoken
[56:04] out because that's what the word is the
[56:05] word is the expression of that thought
[56:08] so it's spoken out in morphe later he
[56:10] becomes flesh jesus mortal to taste
[56:13] death for all of us sinners
[56:15] and brother roman said he unfolds here
[56:17] what all the attributes will do in the
[56:18] final end
[56:20] every son of abraham
[56:22] every son of the faith
[56:24] will absolutely
[56:26] do the same thing
[56:28] do the same thing that abraham did
[56:30] as abraham sat there and saw god
[56:32] manifested in the flesh that theophany
[56:35] hidden behind the veil of that flesh and
[56:37] come and sat down with him and talked to
[56:38] him and had communion with him
[56:41] brother brown said who was it he never
[56:44] was born
[56:45] he never will die
[56:48] who is it it was god sure it was in the
[56:50] foreshadow of the lord jesus
[56:53] certainly was but he had to come through
[56:54] a woman
[56:55] in the order you come through a woman
[56:59] so how did we come
[57:01] we come from attribute to flesh
[57:04] he said he was at the beginning the word
[57:05] an in morphy body he came in and lived
[57:07] in that in the purple person of
[57:09] melchizedek then later we never heard no
[57:11] more of melchizedek because he became
[57:13] jesus christ
[57:15] melchizedek was the priest
[57:18] but he became jesus christ
[57:20] now you bypass that because in that form
[57:23] he knowed all things and you have never
[57:25] been able to know that yet wouldn't that
[57:27] be great to be able to know all things
[57:30] my so we could set one another straight
[57:32] no
[57:33] [Laughter]
[57:35] to know all that you think you think
[57:37] about when brother brown went beyond the
[57:38] curtain of time when he went over there
[57:39] and they were telling him what was going
[57:41] to happen and how things were because
[57:44] why when they went when they went beyond
[57:46] the curtain of time now they were in a
[57:48] state
[57:49] where they could have understanding of
[57:50] all things they were back to the play
[57:52] have been redeemed back to the place
[57:54] where god god wanted them to be from the
[57:56] foundation of the world that to be in
[57:58] that place where they could know and not
[57:59] be restricted by these time elements and
[58:02] by our own thoughts and by our own ideas
[58:04] and our opinions and things
[58:06] they were in that back in that condition
[58:09] and we bypassed that you see
[58:11] he said but when this life is finished
[58:13] here
[58:14] and he quotes again in second
[58:15] corinthians if our earthly house of this
[58:17] tabernacle were dissolved
[58:19] we've got a building of god and house
[58:22] not made with hands
[58:24] a tabernacle
[58:26] we've got a tabernacle he said that's
[58:28] where we go so where do we go he said
[58:31] that's where we go
[58:32] that is the word
[58:34] where are you going to go with you when
[58:36] you die if you've received the word and
[58:37] you've heard this spoken word
[58:39] when you die if you're born again now
[58:42] you're going to go back to the word
[58:44] he said that's where we go that is the
[58:46] word then we
[58:47] we can look back
[58:49] and see what we've done
[58:52] boy you think about these ones that have
[58:53] gone on and stepped across the curtain
[58:55] of time and
[58:57] and the rejoicing that's taken place as
[58:59] they look back
[59:00] and now they have an understanding of
[59:03] what happened
[59:04] and what we're doing down here and now
[59:06] they can look back and
[59:08] and review their life and review all the
[59:10] things that maybe were a mystery to them
[59:12] then
[59:12] why they went to this church and why
[59:14] they went to that church and why they
[59:15] ended up here and these things and all
[59:18] all that and but now it begins to be
[59:20] clear because they can look back he said
[59:22] now we don't understand it we have never
[59:25] become the word we've just become the
[59:26] flesh man not the word
[59:29] and you'll never be the word unless he
[59:30] was a thought at the beginning
[59:33] you'll never be a word unless she was a
[59:35] thought at the beginning
[59:42] but we've got the earnest
[59:44] y'all doing all right tonight
[59:47] it's it's not gonna bother me tonight if
[59:49] y'all sleep i'm preaching to to just
[59:51] wherever i'm just gonna lay it out
[59:57] that is right
[59:59] brother ramon said when this body
[1:00:00] receives the spirit of god the immortal
[1:00:02] life inside of you
[1:00:04] it throws this body in in subjection to
[1:00:07] god
[1:00:08] when you receive the word and you're
[1:00:10] sitting in church and you hear and that
[1:00:11] word becomes quicken and it begins to
[1:00:13] move what's it taking you it's taking
[1:00:15] you back to the word
[1:00:17] you see how the rapture happens the
[1:00:19] rapture is such a mysterious thing but
[1:00:21] what happens is as soon as you're born
[1:00:22] again the rapture started and it begins
[1:00:25] transforming you and molding you and
[1:00:26] taking you back to return back to the
[1:00:30] word to that condition where you know
[1:00:32] all things where you're one with god
[1:00:35] where you're you're a supernatural
[1:00:37] something takes place
[1:00:39] he said in romans chapter 8 there is
[1:00:41] therefore now no condemnation of them
[1:00:43] which are in christ jesus who walk not
[1:00:45] after the flesh
[1:00:47] but after the spirit see what are we
[1:00:49] motivated by that thing that's veiled
[1:00:51] behind our flesh
[1:00:53] the spirit of the living god
[1:00:55] for the law of the spirit of life in
[1:00:57] christ jesus has made me free from the
[1:00:59] law of sin and death
[1:01:01] and that's why brother roman said you
[1:01:03] don't have to say oh if i could just
[1:01:04] quit drinking
[1:01:06] oh oh if i could just quit how do you
[1:01:08] quit drinking not because you you you
[1:01:10] strain real hard or you you will very
[1:01:13] much just quit doing those things but
[1:01:15] because the word has taken over your
[1:01:17] life
[1:01:18] and it's the word that that that word
[1:01:21] behind the veil that's doing the taking
[1:01:23] over that's doing the living that's
[1:01:24] doing the motivating of your members and
[1:01:27] brother i said just get in christ and
[1:01:28] it's all gone see because your body is
[1:01:32] subject to the spirit
[1:01:34] it's no more subject to the things of
[1:01:36] the world they're dead they are dead
[1:01:38] your sins are buried in baptism and you
[1:01:40] are a new creature creation in christ
[1:01:45] and what is that spirit in you he said
[1:01:46] that spirit is nothing in this world but
[1:01:49] the seed word made manifest or quickened
[1:01:53] made alive
[1:01:54] and when the bible said don't do this
[1:01:56] that body quickly turns to it there's no
[1:01:59] question
[1:02:00] it's the earnest of our resurrection
[1:02:02] it's the earnest of it that this body is
[1:02:05] going to raise up again
[1:02:08] now you start thinking about bodies when
[1:02:10] he's preaching on the melchizedek
[1:02:15] just the same as when you're born a
[1:02:17] little baby
[1:02:19] you come into the world and you you come
[1:02:21] uh you're you
[1:02:22] while your little body is growing in the
[1:02:24] mother your your members are twitching
[1:02:26] and jerking and things but then when
[1:02:28] you're born you come out screaming and
[1:02:29] there's a life that goes into that body
[1:02:32] now now uh let's just meditate on this
[1:02:35] for a little bit i know this is
[1:02:36] wednesday night wednesday night we get a
[1:02:37] little bit sleepy sometimes and it may
[1:02:39] be a little bit deep but just think
[1:02:40] about this now
[1:02:42] that when you're when a little baby is
[1:02:43] born
[1:02:44] that there's a life there's a
[1:02:46] spiritual body that goes into that baby
[1:02:49] he said that little body now is not
[1:02:51] alive yet see the only thing it is is
[1:02:53] just flesh and muscles but when it comes
[1:02:56] forth from the womb
[1:02:57] god breathes the breath of life into it
[1:03:00] and then it screams out
[1:03:03] just as sure as there is a natural body
[1:03:05] being formed there is a spiritual body
[1:03:08] to receive it as soon as it gets here so
[1:03:11] just as sure as that little natural body
[1:03:13] is being formed there's also a spiritual
[1:03:15] body a spiritual body
[1:03:17] and brother adam said then when a man is
[1:03:19] born again from heaven he becomes a
[1:03:20] spirit babe in christ and then when this
[1:03:23] robe of flesh is dropped there is a body
[1:03:25] not made with hands
[1:03:27] neither born of a woman that we go to
[1:03:30] when this flesh drops away
[1:03:32] there's something that you go to where
[1:03:34] you you still got hands
[1:03:36] you still got eyes
[1:03:38] you can still hug somebody because
[1:03:40] there's a body that you go to
[1:03:43] he said then that body returns back
[1:03:46] and picks up the glorified body
[1:03:48] when
[1:03:49] when it's time for the rapture
[1:03:52] you you think now now what you think
[1:03:54] when brother branham was laying there
[1:03:55] when he went beyond the curtain of time
[1:03:57] and he looked back and he saw his body
[1:03:59] laying there well now he's in another
[1:04:01] body
[1:04:02] a body
[1:04:03] and he's able to walk and hug those
[1:04:06] people beyond the curtain of time and
[1:04:07] talk to him
[1:04:09] what is that body
[1:04:11] the theophany body he said that's the
[1:04:13] reason jesus went to hell when he died
[1:04:15] and preached the souls that were
[1:04:17] imprisoned turn back
[1:04:19] turn back into that theophany now jesus
[1:04:22] left his body laying there in that grave
[1:04:24] and he preached
[1:04:25] to the souls in hell and he was in he
[1:04:28] was in a body
[1:04:29] with hands and and eyes and and he could
[1:04:32] talk to them and preach to him so he had
[1:04:34] a voice that he could speak through he
[1:04:36] had a body
[1:04:38] the problem said when testing of his
[1:04:40] word is over then we are taken up to
[1:04:41] this body that was prepared for us
[1:04:43] before the foundation of the world
[1:04:46] it is the word there
[1:04:48] that we skipped
[1:04:50] to come right around down here to be
[1:04:52] tempted and tested if we had to come
[1:04:54] through that there'd have been no
[1:04:55] temptation we'd have known all things
[1:04:58] that's the reason jesus knowed all
[1:04:59] things because he was word before he was
[1:05:01] flesh
[1:05:02] then we become
[1:05:04] the word
[1:05:06] we accept god by faith by the written
[1:05:08] word he said then there is something in
[1:05:10] there it's that eternal life
[1:05:12] you were predestinated to it
[1:05:14] and you know he tells that story of the
[1:05:16] little chicken in the barnyard that one
[1:05:18] day heard heard from that mother eagle
[1:05:20] cry the mother eagle typing the word
[1:05:23] crying out and he said you heard from
[1:05:25] your theophany what are you hearing from
[1:05:28] you're hearing from that word that
[1:05:29] you're going back to
[1:05:31] you're hearing from the word
[1:05:33] now now brother brown said
[1:05:38] i know i know this is deep i'm i'm i
[1:05:40] feel like i'm pressing in now
[1:05:45] maybe i'll slow down a little bit
[1:05:49] yo
[1:05:50] yo i'll be like don't slow down
[1:05:54] in hebrews chapter 2
[1:05:56] brother adam said the difference
[1:05:58] what is that what is that theophany now
[1:06:00] let's let's see what brother brown said
[1:06:02] he said in hebrews chapter two uh part
[1:06:05] three he said the difference between an
[1:06:06] animal and a man god put a soul in a man
[1:06:10] and he didn't put it in the animal
[1:06:13] because the soul
[1:06:15] that was in the man is that theophany so
[1:06:18] in other words there's something behind
[1:06:19] your flesh that's moving that's moving
[1:06:21] your being
[1:06:22] and when you're born again
[1:06:24] there's still there's now it's god that
[1:06:26] personality that same one that's been
[1:06:28] manifesting himself down through the
[1:06:29] ages and he's he's manifesting those
[1:06:31] same characteristics the same
[1:06:33] personality that was in jesus christ
[1:06:35] and now
[1:06:36] it's manifested in you
[1:06:38] and the entombment and brother brown in
[1:06:40] 1957 he said here he goes where did he
[1:06:42] leave when he left the bible said he
[1:06:44] ascended he went and preached to the
[1:06:45] souls that were in prison prison when
[1:06:47] jesus when jesus died he said that
[1:06:49] repented not in the long suffering of
[1:06:51] the days of sower of noah
[1:06:53] his soul
[1:06:54] his spirit his theophany of his own
[1:06:56] being
[1:06:57] went down
[1:06:59] and then into the entirement in 1957
[1:07:01] brother ram began to sing a song during
[1:07:03] the service he said as job or he quote
[1:07:05] this poem it was a poem he said as job
[1:07:07] as job of old when we hear that ashes to
[1:07:09] ashes
[1:07:10] and dust to dust
[1:07:12] it reminds me of longfellow who said
[1:07:14] tell me not
[1:07:16] in mournful numbers
[1:07:17] life is just an empty dream
[1:07:20] and the soul
[1:07:22] is dead that slumbers
[1:07:24] and things are not what they seem
[1:07:27] yea life is real life is earnest and the
[1:07:29] grave is not its goal
[1:07:32] for dust thou art to dust returneth was
[1:07:35] not spoken of the soul
[1:07:38] they call it a theophany
[1:07:40] that when we leave here we go in
[1:07:43] somewhere else
[1:07:44] in other words when this when this flesh
[1:07:47] drops away
[1:07:48] you're not just some wispy thing
[1:07:50] floating around
[1:07:51] but you still got a body
[1:07:54] and you got a good body a body that
[1:07:56] knows all things
[1:07:58] that can still hug and can still can
[1:08:01] still fellowship that can sit down with
[1:08:03] somebody
[1:08:05] you've got a body
[1:08:06] and brother brown in 19 in 1957 in
[1:08:09] questions and answers he said
[1:08:11] my jehovah's witness friend i'd like to
[1:08:14] ask you about that if hell is a place
[1:08:15] whatever you wish to call it if that
[1:08:17] ceases at the grave then why did he say
[1:08:19] i'll not leave my soul in hell
[1:08:22] here his body was in the grave and his
[1:08:24] soul was in hell preaching to life
[1:08:27] he was in theophany again
[1:08:30] his soul was down there with those
[1:08:32] people that were in theophany also
[1:08:35] what
[1:08:37] the ones in hell weren't theophany also
[1:08:40] because they got a body
[1:08:42] they got a body just because
[1:08:45] they were in hell doesn't mean they're
[1:08:47] just a floaty mis wispy thing
[1:08:49] they got a supernatural body that
[1:08:51] they're still in that persists past your
[1:08:54] flesh dying
[1:08:56] and he said he was witness unto them
[1:08:58] that they repented not in the long
[1:08:59] suffering
[1:09:02] and brother remembering questions and
[1:09:03] answers in 1961 he said when a baby is
[1:09:06] being formed in a womb of a mother
[1:09:09] as soon as it's born in this world and
[1:09:11] breathes its first breath
[1:09:14] it becomes a living soul
[1:09:16] just as soon as the babies dropped into
[1:09:18] the earth and flesh there's a spiritual
[1:09:20] body waiting to receive it
[1:09:23] as soon as the spiritual body the
[1:09:26] natural body is dissolved there's a
[1:09:28] spiritual body
[1:09:29] weight in yonder
[1:09:31] a theophany we call it see a theophany
[1:09:35] because as soon as that little baby is
[1:09:37] born
[1:09:39] it's got a soul
[1:09:41] so that if it dies
[1:09:43] it's not just gonna float off somewhere
[1:09:45] but it's got a body
[1:09:49] now i'll be closing here in just a
[1:09:50] minute y'all y'all just hang on
[1:09:53] you remember when when uh
[1:09:55] when in the story of of the mount
[1:09:57] transfiguration when jesus went up on
[1:09:59] the top of the mountain there was two
[1:10:00] people with him moses and elijah and
[1:10:03] they weren't just floating around but
[1:10:05] they were there
[1:10:06] in their theophany
[1:10:08] and brother brown said 800 years later
[1:10:10] on mount transfiguration after those men
[1:10:12] had lived and died he said moses body
[1:10:15] had been rotten for hundreds of years
[1:10:17] but here he was in such a form till even
[1:10:19] peter james and john recognized him
[1:10:22] if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved
[1:10:24] if you're an attribute of god expressed
[1:10:26] here on earth you've got a body waiting
[1:10:29] after you leave this world
[1:10:31] there they was
[1:10:32] standing on mount transfiguration in
[1:10:35] their theophany for they were prophets
[1:10:38] to whom the word came to
[1:10:40] remember when when saul went and got the
[1:10:42] witch of endor and and and and she
[1:10:45] called up samuel and their their
[1:10:46] appeared samuel to her
[1:10:48] saul couldn't see it but there's there
[1:10:50] he was and he wasn't just floating
[1:10:52] around but he said about three or four
[1:10:54] years later the king got in trouble
[1:10:56] there was before the blood of jesus
[1:10:58] christ was ever shed he was in paradise
[1:10:59] and a witch of india called for somebody
[1:11:01] to come and console saul
[1:11:03] and when the witch saw him standing up
[1:11:05] she said i see god raising up out of the
[1:11:07] earth
[1:11:08] he entered into the theophany
[1:11:11] which was the word
[1:11:13] he said you get it
[1:11:15] now now he said now
[1:11:18] the true revelation of melchizedek comes
[1:11:21] into view
[1:11:23] what
[1:11:24] he was god the word before he became
[1:11:27] flesh
[1:11:28] god the word
[1:11:30] because he had to be
[1:11:32] no one else
[1:11:33] could be immortal like him
[1:11:36] behind that flesh was the soul of god
[1:11:38] working behind the flesh veil in
[1:11:40] melchizedek that same god that was
[1:11:42] veiled in melchizedek then veiled
[1:11:44] himself in the flesh of jesus christ
[1:11:46] and now again in this last day he's
[1:11:49] supposed to veil himself
[1:11:51] behind the flesh of the bride in the
[1:11:53] form of the son of man as he's
[1:11:55] manifested
[1:11:57] see he said i had father and mother you
[1:11:59] did too jesus had father and mother but
[1:12:00] this man had no father had no mother
[1:12:02] jesus had a time he started this man
[1:12:04] didn't
[1:12:05] we're talking what are we talking about
[1:12:07] the flesh on the outside the flesh or
[1:12:09] the one on the inside that's doing the
[1:12:11] moving that's doing the work and the
[1:12:12] theophany
[1:12:14] jesus had a time he started this man
[1:12:16] didn't jesus that flesh that was born
[1:12:19] jesus gave his life this man couldn't
[1:12:20] because he was life
[1:12:22] and it's the self-same man
[1:12:24] all the time
[1:12:26] he said i hope god reveals it to you
[1:12:29] the self-same person
[1:12:31] all the time
[1:12:34] who was this who is this milk as it is
[1:12:38] we see her plainly
[1:12:40] the complete secret of our lives and
[1:12:42] journey and death and where we go after
[1:12:44] we die
[1:12:46] also predestination is in plain view
[1:12:48] here
[1:12:49] all these things are made plain
[1:12:53] i mean i just maybe want to call your
[1:12:54] attention just
[1:12:56] sometimes we think
[1:12:58] what when we come to church what we're
[1:12:59] really doing
[1:13:01] is we want to have our my eyes opened up
[1:13:03] to the plate to the what the scripture
[1:13:05] is really talking about
[1:13:07] i heard somebody say one time i like to
[1:13:09] i like to go to i like to go to a church
[1:13:11] where the preacher doesn't look at his
[1:13:12] notes that he just preaches
[1:13:15] and so you can get in your mind all
[1:13:16] these things about what a good church
[1:13:18] service it really is but what really is
[1:13:20] a good church service
[1:13:21] when you can begin to understand
[1:13:24] when you can understand
[1:13:26] see sometimes like right now it doesn't
[1:13:29] matter if there's not a lot of jumping
[1:13:30] and screaming because you look out of
[1:13:32] the ocean and and there's a lot going on
[1:13:35] the water is going up and evaporating
[1:13:37] and forming clouds
[1:13:38] and it's going to make rain clouds and
[1:13:40] it's going to come down and you don't
[1:13:41] see the water going up you don't see
[1:13:43] something happening but yet there's
[1:13:45] something happening
[1:13:46] and i believe right now even in the
[1:13:48] stillness as the word is being preached
[1:13:50] something's happening
[1:13:51] why because you're understanding when
[1:13:54] you're under when you begin to gain
[1:13:55] understanding that is what will give you
[1:13:58] victory over the devil that's what
[1:14:00] brother wade's been preaching about
[1:14:02] maybe not so much jumping and hollering
[1:14:04] things those those are good that's good
[1:14:06] to do and many times when you really
[1:14:08] catch a real revelation of what the
[1:14:10] scripture is saying it'll make you jump
[1:14:12] and shout and things and we just
[1:14:13] certainly don't want to mock that
[1:14:15] but see what we're here for is to
[1:14:17] understand
[1:14:19] to understand who is this melchizedek
[1:14:23] see even in the quiet stillness says the
[1:14:25] word is being preached something's
[1:14:26] happening
[1:14:27] what's happening we're being redeemed
[1:14:30] back
[1:14:30] we're being brought back
[1:14:33] that's what redeemed men's
[1:14:35] means is to bring back to its original
[1:14:37] place and what's the original place
[1:14:39] where we going back back
[1:14:41] to the word that's why the scripture
[1:14:43] says that new jerusalem is the mother of
[1:14:46] us all because we came from the word new
[1:14:49] jerusalem type in the word that's where
[1:14:50] we come from and we're going back to our
[1:14:53] home which is the word
[1:14:55] we've come from the word and that's
[1:14:56] where we're going back to
[1:14:58] and brother said it's only that
[1:14:59] predestinated
[1:15:01] will be brought back
[1:15:03] it's only the ones who god thought of
[1:15:05] before the foundation of the world only
[1:15:07] those thoughts in his minds and his mind
[1:15:09] that there's going to be somebody that
[1:15:11] will grow in grace that will be born
[1:15:13] again that will receive the message for
[1:15:15] their age
[1:15:16] that will hear the preaching of the god
[1:15:18] of the gospel that will respond to the
[1:15:20] spoken word
[1:15:22] brother said the eternal life that you
[1:15:24] had his thought of what you was
[1:15:27] only
[1:15:28] he said he wanted me to stand in the
[1:15:30] pulpit
[1:15:32] he wanted you to sit in the seat tonight
[1:15:35] then we are serving his eternal purpose
[1:15:38] and the one that left home only come to
[1:15:40] the earth to serve his purpose
[1:15:42] then after it's finished it's brought
[1:15:44] back in a glorified state
[1:15:46] it's matured and brought back again
[1:15:50] so we know we know there's something
[1:15:53] drawing us back draw pulling us back to
[1:15:56] redemption that's why there's three
[1:15:57] pulls because god is god is pulling us
[1:16:00] back to himself
[1:16:01] brother ryan said we know when we walk
[1:16:03] into the presence of god something in us
[1:16:05] tells that tells us that we come from
[1:16:07] somewhere where'd you come from from the
[1:16:10] mind of god
[1:16:11] that he thought about you and we're
[1:16:13] going back again by that power
[1:16:16] that's pulling on us
[1:16:18] we're going back by that power that's
[1:16:21] pulling us
[1:16:25] so who is this melchizedek then
[1:16:28] who was this melchizedek that's the same
[1:16:30] yesterday today and forever
[1:16:33] you know when when jesus was walking
[1:16:35] with the with the on the road to emmaus
[1:16:37] with with cleopas and his friend he was
[1:16:39] walking with him and he was actually god
[1:16:41] that theophany veiled in flesh talking
[1:16:44] to them and they failed to recognize who
[1:16:46] he was
[1:16:47] i wonder if the king of sodom and sodom
[1:16:50] knew who that was when the king when
[1:16:51] that melchizedek came up and sat down
[1:16:53] with abraham and began to
[1:16:55] share the bread and the wine with him
[1:16:57] they surely didn't recognize jesus when
[1:17:00] he came that was god veiled in flesh
[1:17:03] i wonder will they recognize in this day
[1:17:06] i wonder do you recognize
[1:17:08] because when you recognize
[1:17:10] when the bride begins to realize who she
[1:17:12] is
[1:17:13] when you recognize what you are
[1:17:17] then you will be an invincible army
[1:17:21] you will be an army for the lord that
[1:17:23] the devil cannot do anything with
[1:17:26] and it won't be because you jumped and
[1:17:28] shouted so much even though maybe you
[1:17:30] will
[1:17:31] but it's because god has given you a
[1:17:33] supernatural understanding
[1:17:36] you see when you preach sermons like
[1:17:37] this maybe it's not just for little
[1:17:39] babies
[1:17:40] you a little baby's not gonna get maybe
[1:17:42] get much out of out of talking about
[1:17:44] attributes and talking about uh
[1:17:46] theophanies and things but
[1:17:48] god wants you to grow to a place where
[1:17:50] this means something to you
[1:17:52] where you don't just just push it aside
[1:17:55] and say that i i don't really need this
[1:17:57] but it's something that's important to
[1:17:59] you to know who was that melchizedek and
[1:18:03] what is his relation to jesus christ and
[1:18:06] what is his relation to you
[1:18:08] because brother ram said in this message
[1:18:11] he said who was it
[1:18:13] he never was born he never will die it
[1:18:16] was god sure it was and the foreshadow
[1:18:18] of the lord jesus certainly was but he
[1:18:20] had to come through a woman in the order
[1:18:21] you come through a woman and he had to
[1:18:23] come the way you come in order to bring
[1:18:25] you back to him
[1:18:27] so we know who that melchizedek was
[1:18:30] but what if that same melchizedek is
[1:18:32] manifested today
[1:18:34] who was this milk is today because the
[1:18:36] musicians come
[1:18:37] who is this melchizedek to think that
[1:18:40] god could manifest himself in the flesh
[1:18:42] and the flesh pull all that potassium
[1:18:44] and calcium around him and walk up to
[1:18:46] abraham and and and veil himself in the
[1:18:49] flesh of jesus christ and in this day
[1:18:52] veil himself
[1:18:53] in the flesh of his bride
[1:18:55] and reveal himself
[1:18:57] in the form of one word body a body of
[1:19:00] believers this acting and doing together
[1:19:03] in accord with what the word says
[1:19:07] i believe god is here let's stand to our
