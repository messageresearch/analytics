have need of we ask all these things in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen second Peter chapter 3 we're going to begin at verse one and T tonight I want to title this the promise of his coming and begin at uh second Peter 3 begin at verse one and it says this Second Epistle beloved I now write unto you and both which I stir up your pure Minds in a way by way of remembrance that you may be mindful of The Words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the Commandment of us the Apostles of the Lord and Savior knowing this first that there shall come in the last day scoffers walking after their own lust and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation for this they are willingly they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the Earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that was that then was being overflowed with water perished but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved un fire against the day of judgment and the predition of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to us word not willing that any should perish but that all should should come to repentance but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in the heavens which shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the Earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up amen God bless you you may be seated tonight and U I just want to look at this little thought the promise of his coming and one of the things I was I was looking at was the you know Peter's writing here and and one of the things that he was talking about was the scoffers in the last days and we see the condition that the world is in and um I really enjoyed what brother Bob had to say uh Sunday and it was really it was really good and uh really blessed me and but you know you look at the condition that the world is in today and you know it's now is the time for people to check up to see where they are just like brother Bob was saying you know Now's the Time because people have gotten to the place where they really don't realize the condition and the hour that the condition they're in but they don't realize the hour in which they're living and they don't and so you know as as he was talking about you know people just kind of they just kind of float along or whatever but they don't realize the the seriousness the lateness of the hour and you know so here's here's uh Peter writing you know he he's writing about the the word that's been given and he says I want to stir up your pure Minds in a way of remembrance and he was talking about the word that they had been given but also going back to the Old Testament what the prophets had spoken and looking back at what was what had been already spoken but he wanted to bring this back and see all of this had taken place we knew how the how the scripture had come but then he was saying that you see the the word has went forth but he said knowing first that the in the last days scoffers shall come walking after their own lust and so we realize you know this is the day that an hour in which we live we're living in that day and so today is the day that you know it's it's a glorious time to live in because the scripture was written for this day the day and hour in which we live is the Glorious Day because you know you think about all of the prophets that had written all the things that Isaiah and Jeremiah and all the prophets had written about all the things that that Paul and Peter and all of all the apostles and the different ones had spoke about that's our day amen and you know what a wonderful time to realize that this is this is the culmination of the plan of God and we're living in the midst of it and sometimes we fail to realize just how great a a day that we're living in and what a serious day that we're living in and what a what a u a responsibility has been given to us what an obligation has been given to us because we are the ones that's to carry this on all this has come to our day right and you know it's a wonderful thing to realize that God called you and I for this day God called us for the for this day this is this is the day you know brother bam said you know he said if if I could pick a day an hour in which to live he said I would want to live in this day and you know you know as brother R was talking about you know people say oh I want to live in Bible days you can't get any more in the Bible today than the day that you're living in because this is the day and hour which the Bible is being fulfilled and it's coming to an end and we're see because if you can't see the day and hour and realize this is the end of the Gentile dispensation because God is finishing with the Gentiles and he will soon turn to the Jews and bring them their message this is the day and it's a glorious day to live in but it's also a fearful day it's a dreadful day because people don't realize the day and hour in which they live but you know as he was talking about he said you see the scoffers would be in the last days brother BR was speaking here in the Rapture he was talking about the prophets he said see Peter was speaking of the he said in the last days these scoffers would come saying these things see it's predicted the reason the people are acting today the way they're acting he said why you certainly are expecting it because the Bible said that in the last days they'd be heady high-minded lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God truce Breakers false accusers incontinent despisers of those that are good having a form of godliness and denying the power thereof from such turn away he said can we look for an impersonation of Truth certainly because that is the day that hour in which we live that you see that everybody has take they've heard the word and they they've taken the word of God but they've made it a none effect and that was that was the whole point all the way through but we see how this is the day and hour which we live and then as they were speaking here the as the scoffers would say they would say where is the promise of his coming where is where is the promise of the word that was given and he said because they said well since our fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning and it's just a continuation on of the same thing and you brother Bram was talking of you know the the people that have that heard the the scripture and you know he was talking about the man that you know talking about the you know Jesus didn't die on the cross and you know he had he had a deal worked out with pilot and you know all these type things that they they just try to sew these seeds in and try to tell people that you know the scripture is not right you know there's all all these little things that are that were said that didn't make any sense but he said see that that's what the critics are supposed to do he said that's the day in which we're living He said they were scoffers that he said that's the day to fulfill the prophecy all those things that were taking place that that he was talking about those were fulfilling the prophecy of the day scoffers in the last days he said he said see they they take the scripture and he said there's no difference in the time than what it was he said when our fathers fell asleep he said but you can see these things begin to happen he said raise up your head get ready something could happen at any time Christ come for his church so you see these things that are taking place why because this is an end time sign that you're going to see these things taking place and people are looking and they wondering why you know they say well we're looking for the Fulfillment of the scripture we're trying to understand well you know what one of the fulfillments of the scripture is when scoffers come because brother BR said the scoffers coming and saying where is the where is the the promise of his coming and they're turning down the word and he said that is a fulfilling of the scriptures so you're seeing a fulfillment of the scripture he said the people don't realize that doing these things and saying these things they're fulfilling the scriptures you see the thing is one day because you you and I all of us are going to fulfill some part of the scripture there's going to be a a scripture that you're going to fulfill because you're either going to believe the word you're going to walk in the word you're going to make the word manifest or you're going to deny the word and fall and and be left behind because only those that are walking in the light are going to walk in the word going to walk and be changed by the word are going to make a Rapture because that's what's promised for them but the other ones if they do not follow the word if they deny the word and it only takes just a little bit because if Eve only fell on one word then how much more because you've got to follow all of the words you got to have all the word and walk in the fullness of the word and walk in what God has called you to but the other thing that's required is you've got to have a desire for the word because if you've got the Holy Ghost inside of you then it desires the word right and it desires for you to be drawn to the word and so you're going to walk in that and and even if you don't understand the word word right because you know it it takes it's a growth as brother PA was talking about you know it's a growth that you've got to grow in this thing but if you don't if you don't continue in it that you're not ever going to grow right and so you know it's not you know just you just something that you fall into you know because there's some there's a growth that takes place and there's an overcoming that takes place and you've got to continue in that right that's right and see how even in the days of of Jesus when you see how you know he was talking about chaus and and the different ones see you know they they were there listening and they actually seen the word made flesh for their day and they stood there and he said they turned the word down they scoffed at the word that was made flesh before them they had heard the word they had seen the word and they scoffed it and he said they were standing in the temple when the when the crucifixion was taking place and they're standing in the temple singing my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me and there he was hanging on the cross fulfilling the scripture that they're singing about and not realizing that they're living in the midst of the day of the Fulfillment of the word and they're missing that and he said see this because he said it was predicted for the by the scriptures for them to be blind because it was it was the time and see it's the same thing happening today is people are walking in the midst and being blind bited being standing in the midst of the word and the midst and the word going forth from from the the ministry and and you you're hearing the word and you're not catching the word amen and not and not realizing it's the word for you it's what you have to receive the word you brother R was speaking of there when he was when he was speaking of of Noah's day and he was talking about Noah ministering and you know the the the Earth the world had come under judgment and it was a there was a judgment went forth and listen they were under a death sentence and they would there was no way out there was everybody listen you're going to face this there's no other way right but God made a way of Escape God made a way for them to to pass by that but there was only one way made and so when when Noah had this had this because God seen the wickedness of man and he said he was going to destroy the Earth and he was going to destroy all of the works that took that that was there in and he when he gave Noah the message and he said listen he said now you got to build an ark and and he began to talk you know tell Noah about these things but you know he was talking about the the age in which Noah was living was such a great scientific age and you know they had seen all of the things and they had such great scientific knowledge and all that you know they they could shoot this into the skies and they were there and they could prove that there was no moisture in the air and you know how brother R said how God he uh watered the Earth by the uh irrigation and all of that and there was no water that ever came the the Springs watered the Earth and you know there never was anything like this before and here he is Noah comes out here this crazy man comes out and tells them listen the Earth is going to rain there's coming a destruction well you know what nobody ever heard anything like this before I mean this this is a total new message and we got this crazy man out here and he's going to build this huge boat you know and he's going he's going to put all these animals in it and he's like you know and and and you know how we know that he went on all those 120 years of him preaching to his generation to tell them listen you're under judgment and there's only one way out and that's God's way there's no other way that you're going to escape this and you know and as he began to preach and he began to put his faith in action and started building what God told him to do was build that Ark and and he began to build that and you know every time as we we've many times have been dramatized but you know here they are they come by and all they saying is Noah building on an ark and keeps preaching the exact same thing you're under judgment you're under judgment are you going to are you going to accept God's way of Escape or you going to live or you going to face this judgment and you know they keep he was out there building and every time you came by it's the exact same thing you know you got to repent or perish you got to get ready you know he kept going through all of that you know he lived in that great that great scientific day in which he lived and all the things that he had seen well you know they were there there was nothing scientific that could prove what Noah said there was nothing that give them any any reason to believe anything that Noah said that's right there was nothing that was given but they still Noah preached that message and he stood right there and he began to preach that the whole time listen God's going to send rain the water's coming from the sky and it's like well how is this going to take place he's like there I mean there's no scientific way there's I mean you know please explain that well all I know is God said so that's all I got is God said so because God can do whatever he wants to right and it's like well but they couldn't believe that it had never rained and and you know all those type things but he said listen it's going to rain going to destroy the Earth he said now you got to get ready he said because in all of this you've got to get ready there's only one way and so Noah had his in had his instructions and he began to build all those things and you know as the generations came along you had one that was standing there and and dad made fun of it it's like hey let's go by and see the see the crazy man and Noah's out there building this Ark well you know his sons were out there helping him and you know but he spent all of those years building that and you know and then it was just like well you know the son comes along and he's like I following Daddy's footsteps and it's like hey how's it going up there building your Ark and you know have you seen any rain yet we ain't seen any clouds but you know he kept pray but you know he kept preaching the same thing and you know no doubt he had a lot of people that just you know out ridicule him the whole time about what he was doing but you know it never deterred Noah from what he was what he was preaching it never deterred no from fulfilling the word of God he just continued in building that Ark and following the word of God but you know there was only there were a certain group in that you know they only got to the place where they stood around and listened right you know there was only there was a group that actually sat there and listened to Noah and they were listening to his message and he's out there saying listen you're under you're under the death you know you're going to die if you don't take if you don't accept this and you know here they are you know you're under a death sentence well you know they they just sit there and listen to them yeah but it never got them on the ark you know there was some that listen well there was a lot of them that didn't listen to any of it they just well you know he you know he's just full of it and you know we just let the let the crazies go and you w not worried about it but you know there was some people that that got halfway interested in what he had to say but the problem was it never got to the place where they actually were sold out to the place they actually got on the ark you know that's like well you know I don't I just want to hang around close enough that maybe I can get on maybe there but you know God said listen you've got to get on the ark when the doors open there's only one time that you're going to be able to get on that and it's when the door is open when the Call's made because when Noah built the ark and he started to call the animals and put the animals and he began to get everything set for for this happening to take place for the flood to take place when this began to happen you know it's so amazing that people began to see the signs and wonders and it still didn't move them to the place where they actually received the word right right that's right well how many other people can see the the animals all these animals lining up walking up on the ark well I'm sure that that Drew a crowd that people wanted to see the the spectacle but you know what it still didn't change their heart it still didn't move them to the place where they actually decided you know what there's something going on here right but you know here they are on standing on the outside looking but you know when when God told Noah when he got all the AR the animals on the ark when he got everything set for the for this passage that he closed the door and it was sealed right and people didn't realize that their destination had already been sealed their judgment had already been sealed but those that had received the word had already got on the ark and they were sealed in away from the Judgment but there was a group that was on the outside well they were just standing there listening and they thought well we just maybe maybe there's another way no there's not another way that's right you're not going to get a second chance right because when they when they were sealed out that was it and you know there was lots of them that were trying to get in when the rain started falling oh hey look it's the manifestation that Noah talked about all these years yeah you know here's here's granddaddy was out talking about it Daddy was talking about it and all the other ones been talking about it all of a sudden hey guess what it's coming to pass but by the time they realized that the Judgment had started to fall they were sealed out their Doom had already been sealed right why because they missed they missed their opportunity to to bypass that amen and they there you know they trying to get the door open and Noah was like listen I didn't close the door I didn't seal the door God did am he was the one that made the way he opened the door for all of you and when he got done he closed the door and it was sealed and your judgment was sealed right amen and it's the same way today God made the has made a way and he's made an opening and he calls to us but the problem is if you don't do that if you don't accept the day and hour which you live and when when the door is opening you don't know when the door is going to be closed we don't know when our time's going to be over with but the thing is is if you miss your opportunity then don't expect to have another opportunity because you've missed your day cuz today is the day of salvation you don't get another chance you've only get one time amen amen now God go because if brother R said if God calls a man one time you know he's just in what he's done and it doesn't matter if you're 12 years old it doesn't matter if you're 14 years old it don't matter if you're a hundred years old it because if God calls you and makes it known to you and you don't accept it then that's your judgment but you've got to call when the day and mult you know the Lord may call multiple times for you to come and that's the grace of God that he calls that he continues to call but you've got to accept that right amen see brother said see it it destroyed the word The World God sent the water just the way he said why it was the word word of God said so he said science drowned and perished he said look the very thing that saved Noah killed his critics did you know that the very water if there had been no water Noah couldn't have been saved the ark was the one that floated so the very thing that floated the ark drowned the critic and he said the very Holy Spirit today that people are making fun of it will save the church and condemn the critic and the very same thing the very same thing what saves kills what saves the believer condemns the UN unbeliever that's right so you see have faith in God's word that's one thing that you can stand on and know it's certain what God says it's certain just believe it right so we see how the the word had went forth and it made it so it carried over what Noah it it brought him through but you see here in the last days of people that are stand there and they're saying well you know where is the sign of his coming because they don't realize that the Judgment has already came and they said well everything continues as it was well it didn't continue as it was because there was already one group that came and had a way of Escape made the Judgment had come to them and they didn't accept it there was a group that accepted that judge the the Salvation that came in their day but there was a group that didn't and it continues on today and just like brother BR was talking about you see the the world you know Noah and his family went on the ark but you know when it when man came off because of the wickedness of their heart when they came off the ark you know what it went right back to the same way they were doing the exact same thing they went man what went right back to the same way that he was doing before he got because God spoke to them and drove them in but you know what in time they went right back away from God he began to you began to deal with them but you know what they went right back to their same old ways and he had made a for them and see because brother talking about the the the world you know it washed away all of the all the things that were on the Earth all of the the creation all the things that man had built and all of the all of the the humans that that were here all that was gone but when they came back you know what they went right back to building the same thing doing the same thing and got away from it what God had brought them to and trying to show them and he said why because you know that wasn't a change that took place but it was showing God was showing what was what was coming what was taking place and see so you you come right back to these things and people say you know when you're when you're looking at um justification because you know Ty the typing of the the washing of the Earth was was a type of justification he was like you know see it doesn't do away with with that in with that uh inner man because you know you still have the same desires that you had before but you you know there's a because God draws you and he brings you to a place and you accept what God does and you know then by justification by accepting repentance for your sins then you can be then you're baptized but that doesn't change who you are that's right but you know because you still have the same desires you're still fighting the same thing the same way that the Earth was going through and you you see how these things are but see you're still fighting those things but you know it still but God began to work through the through the things that were taking place in the earth and you you see how the the Earth was was flooded the the brother called at the baptism but you see how these things take place but you know people don't see that there was something that was taking place and you know there became a a a change that was taking place and you know when when Jesus came when the when the when the prophets began to speak and all all the way down through time you know God began to deal with man and he began to open it you know reveal himself to men and began to express himself and all the things that all the prophets began to do and began to speak they began to see God sometimes they didn't realize that's who it was but you know it was it was God in the prophets it was God in Moses it was God in in Isaiah it was God and Jeremiah when they and God and David began to speak to the people and began to show themselves but you know people didn't catch the the opening of the word they didn't catch God's manifestation in their day some people did but some didn't that's right but you know he began to began to open himself up and began to manifest and and he be and began to from the beginning you know he began to talk about what was going to take place and here he is how he was going to come and he was going to bridge the gap back with man and you know he all the promise that came of a messiah and all that and you know here when Jesus came as the Fulfillment of the word and he began to walk the earth and he began to preach the word the word that he preached was a claiming of the believer of the word came forth he began to claim what was what was lost he began to preach to the people because that was a word that was going forth that he was going to fulfill what was promised and he said because he began to speak and when he began to speak he was setting things in order for a group of Believers to come to the place that he wanted them to come to amen because you know he couldn't he couldn't do that in the Old Testament but there was a time that came when he began to manifest himself that he began to showed to the people what he wanted to do what the scripture had to say what was the Fulfillment of the scripture for that day and you know many people they held on to the Old Testament and began to see but they didn't see that when Jesus began to preach he began to take the things from the Old Testament and began to open them up for the day and show them the day and hour which they were living that he was the Fulfillment of what the prophets had said the things that had David had said and he began to show them this is the day amen amen and you know here he is and he began to preach and he began to tell them listen you know there is a kingdom he was setting up a kingdom that that there was going to be a kingdom it was going to be an eternal Kingdom but it was not in the same way that the disciples thought it was going to be it was not going to be this Earthly Kingdom he's not going to be fighting the Romans he's not going to be going all that but he said it's going to be a kingdom it's going to be inside of you and you're going to see these things but you're going to have but it's going to be a spiritual Kingdom that you're going to come to right amen as as he began to talk to him he said listen he said let not your heart you know don't be comfortless let your hearts be comforted by this that listen he said I'm not going to be with you always he said it's expedient that I go away but I'm coming back in a way that I'm not going to be just with you but I'm going to take up residence inside of you amen I'm coming he said he said because I will be with you even in You Until the End of the Age until the end of the world so when he began to talk to him about this he began to teach them about this Kingdom that was coming not not this not this Earthly Kingdom and the things that were going on but there was a spiritual Kingdom because that was what was important because it's not what's done here but there's going to be an afterlife after this about this life that's going to take place after all this is gone amen so it was more important and that's what Jesus was trying to tell them there is a kingdom that's coming because when when you see this you know they're W they're wanting to you know the disciples and you know they're trying to talk about this Kingdom that's coming that's going to be set up on the earth and not realizing there was a whole different way that this was going to come into view there was a different way that it was coming yes there is going to be a kingdom set up on the Earth but it's not going to come the same way that y'all think it's going to come that's right amen there's a whole lot of things that y'all don't see but Jesus began to preach to them and tell them about those things and he began to teach them and listen this is what's going to take place so you know you know we don't have to fight the Romans and all these type things it's it's not an Earthly battle it's a spiritual battle yes but you know even after you know when when Jesus died when when he went to the cross and he and he rose again and he's standing there and he begins to speak to him and he's talking about going away to fulfill the scriptures after he's begin talk to him on the road to a and all the different things talking to Thomas when he didn't believe and all those things that he began to do and began to speak to him about all those things that had taken place when they had seen all these things when they had seen him raised from the dead and they' seen the Miracles that he had done being able to walk through the walls and all those type things and he began to tell them about this Kingdom that was coming he's like are you going to take over now he'd been trying to teach them that it's a spiritual Kingdom right and now is the time that when we get past this listen the I got to go away but the comforter is coming that's right listen I'm going to go away but I'm coming back and the comforter is going to come inside you and he's going to take up residence inside of you and not only that he's going to be a comforter but he's also going to bring to your remembrance the things that you've heard amen the things that you've been taught he's going to lead you and guide you into all truth and as as he was you know he spilled his blood and he Sanctified the Earth and he claimed it am but see you know as they they were missing the whole point of what he was trying to do but see it's the same thing with you and I heing is trying to show us these things and you know here they are they're missing out on the whole thing that he done right and and here's Jesus speaking to the disciples and he told them he said listen he said if you see me go away he said but Terry in Jerusalem till you be endued with power from on high right and so there was a lot more questions than they had answers when they were in the upper room and Jesus began to speak to him in the upper room and he began to express the things that were going to take place and he began to talk to them and he began to break the bread with them and he had communion he began to wash their feet and all these things and he began to teach these things to them and show him what's going to take place but you know he started to show him the heart of a servant and the love that he had for him but but he was trying to show them listen don't be don't lose heart don't be don't be comfortless in this because you know what you're going to see a greater thing that's going to take place but they missed it right amen you know they were they got so downtrodden and lost and you know so sad because what was taking place not realizing there was the exact fulfillment of God's word they're standing in the midst of the Fulfillment of God's word and they're missing it and he goes and he goes to to a send and he tells them listen T and go and wait till the Holy Spirit comes and fulfills what he said he would do am and he comes and and so they go and Terry and you know and you know well we don't know what we're doing we got more questions and we got answers but all we know is what Jesus said and it's like well we don't know we're trying to we're trying to hide from the Romans and you know we don't know what the world's going to take place and you know we're more scared than you know we don't know what to do that's right but you know what they stood right where they God told them to stand where Jesus told them to stand you know and there were well you know we wait one day wait two days week what what do we see nothing but you know what they continue to wait I don't know how long we're going to have to wait but we're going to wait we're going to be right here waiting and teing and waiting until the Fulfillment of the word come amen and you know and well I think we've waited long enough we might have waited long enough I don't know but like Peter said you know we're going to have to wait because if if it's something definite that Jesus said was going to take place then guess what when it fulfills when when you see the Fulfillment of it there's not going to be a question about it right now it may be a question to everybody else but if it comes to you it's not going to be a question to you it's going to be an answer it's going to be a fulfillment it's going to be a confirmation to you that what took place and so when they waited those 10 days when they waited and the sound of a rushing Mighty Wind came down and it flooded the place and it landed upon you know it set upon all of them and they received the Holy Spirit then you know what they didn't have they didn't have a question of what was taking place because that was a fulfilment and it was an answer to them it was a comfort to them and it was so it was a sign to them of what took place and you know what when they had that all of a sudden here they are had great boldness with the word they because they began to De because the Holy Spirit began to lead them it was a fulfillment being again to Quicken the things that he had said to them and so here they are when they're standing there all of a sudden here they are acting like drunk men 120 of them standing up there here they are acting acting drunk and people wonder what what's going on and here's Peter standing there speaking of what was taking place and he said you know he stood up with the 11 you know he stood there and said these men are not drunk as you suppose and he said this is that that was spoken of by the prophet Joel it was a fulfillment of the word amen now there was a lot of people they didn't understand that they didn't believe that but when they start when they staggered out when Peter and them came out and they began to preach the word that they had heard and began to tell them what was taking place this is the Fulfillment of the word but you know there was no doubt many people that were there that heard heard the message I'm sure no doubt there was a a large crowd of people but you know what there was only a certain group of people that actually received the word for their day right we don't know how we know there was the the 5,000 that received it but we don't know how many of that was that were there how many that actually heard the word that was preached that day and they began to because here these people are standing there and they're hearing the word being preached in their own language here it is every they're understanding it because not every not all of them could speak the same language but all the the message that went forth they were hearing it in their own tongue they began to understand what was being preached that day and they begin to receive what was preached and began to understand and they begin to accept it and they because as as Peter began to preach you know it said you know they were pricked in their hearts and they said men and Brethren what shall we do well just believe it amen just just make sure you just get in the line and tell everybody I believe what the apostles preached I'm I'm I'm part of that Upper Room movement I'm going to get me a belt buckle that says the upper room movement no because when they were pricked in their hearts by what the word said he said what did they what was they said men and Brethren what shall we do would just follow us just so well I believe it no he said he said repent right well what does it mean to repent it means to turn from your ways and realize that this is a move of God and I've not been walking in the ways of God and now I can repent of my sin and realize I'm a sinner and he said repent and follow the way that God has called you and he said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and he said and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost but see the problem is is that because they had to realize what the word had come to them and it quickened something to them that they had to fulfill that and because they had faith in what the apostles had said they went out there and they began to repent and they were baptized that's right and they baptized 3,000 souls in one one day like somebody was trying to do the math and it's like well if you got 12 people and you're baptizing 3,000 people that's like several hundred people one person's baptizing and I don't know how many more there was but you know there's 120 in the upper room you know half of them men you know there's 60 men 3,000 that's what 50 so I mean you know here they are preaching the gospel this holy the Holy Spirit and you have this Supernatural meeting taking place and then the rest of the afternoon you're out there baptizing people amen but see it was something that took place but that was the word of God that had broke to them and it began to move and they began to see these things and see they began to walk in those things yes and it became real and all of a sudden the things that that Peter had had wondered about the things that the the apostles had heard that Jesus said all of a sudden the Holy Spirit was there to Quicken these things to them and all of a sudden they begin to be be able to preach the things that they had heard the things that they had seen amen and all of a sudden here they are preaching the gospel and see it's the same way with you and I see when when you come to that place when you realize that the word is come to you and it's yours and you've received this message and it's yours and you realize hey you know what I've got to make a change because you know because you come to a place I I I I had to come to a place in my life you know I I know lord I can't live like this anymore right I had to make a change I I didn't want to live like this anymore because you know I couldn't change myself I couldn't change the situation that I was in but you know what God made a way because all I had to do is accept him and and and yield myself to him and surrender to him that he can do the work amen amen because that's the main thing can you surrender and realize I'm just going to put my hands by myself and everything in your hands Lord and you do the work right let let you do this but I'm going to put my trust in you and realize just just like just like the disciples just like Peter all you know they all done they done things wrong they failed they were men right and you and you to do the same thing we're just humans we're going to fall we're going to have problems we're going to have setbacks but see the thing is is is you've got you've got to come to the place and realize this is what God has called you to and you're going to face this thing and you're going to you have a desire to do this and you have a desire to do it you're going to you're going to do what with what you can and you you got to press into this thing amen you know I mean you know you see things because if you have a desire for something you know what it it you going to you got to fight you've got to press into this thing right amen you know you know I'm I'm going tell on myself a little bit but Richard said I don't never tell I don't never tell nothing about myself I always tell everything on him but um but I think Richard's stories are a lot better than mine or maybe I just tell them better but you know I had people at work when just recently you know I had people come to me at work and you know they asked me are you okay are you all right you know because they they they they were like well what's wrong with you you're not you're not the same person that you used to be said you used to be you were you were the you know everything no matter what went wrong every Problem whatever said you was the ray of sunshine around here he was always positive everything was great it's like why but it's like are you are you we we're just checking on your mental health are you okay and I and you know and and the problem is this and I finally you know because I I had I just you know because you get aggravated with things right and the problem is is when you when you know when you work a job and you and you know I said well I've been here over 11 years I said there was always a standard that we had there was always an expectation of things that had to be done and the way things had to be done there's there was an expectation and there was an accountability that was going to that we had to go through and all these things and I said the problem is is everybody's got away from that I said because now there there's no standard there's no expect ation there's no accountability to anything and I said all of a sudden then you start to see well if you don't have an expectation if you don't have an accountability for things that you know what things don't get done the first thing you don't because nothing can run right because you've got to have a leader and you got to have an expectation and you've got to have a standard that you're going to work from and everybody's got to meet that standard and if you don't if you don't have people meeting the standard then you know what nothing gets done because you know what not everybody can just float along because you know what everybody's got a part to play and everybody's got to do their part and then you you may not be the you may not be what this person is or what that person is but you've got to do what you're called to do it's your job to do your part because I can't do my part and your part and expect everything to run right right and there's people that you hire new people in but you know what you've got to come on you've got to come on on the job and be ready to learn and have have the understanding listen I don't know everything and I'm not a know it all but the problem is is you've got to be to the place that you're willing to learn and you've got to be willing to be taught what needs to be done and you got to realize that when the when the when the job is given to you when the when the order is given to you then you know what you got to do it to the best of your ability and you can't just halfway do something and expect it to be okay that's right and I and I was one and I got frustrated with a lot of people because the problem is is we're not holding the standard right I said because when I got here I said there was an expectation of what had to be done and how it had to be done and I said now everybody just lets everything go however and then we just clean up the mess and I said this is not the way this is supposed to be run right right and I let I I let my feelings getting on and I I had to go back and apologize to them and I I and I did but the problem is is like listen if if this is the way it's got to be done then you know what we've got to hold the standard and if the word of God is the standard and we operate and the way we live our lives and everything operates off of this then you know what either we sell out and we do this exactly the way God says it or we just quit and go home right because that's exactly what I told them at work I said well we either going to do it right or we might as well just go home that's right because you know what it's not going to because you can only run this so far and then after that all you runs into the ground and I told him I said listen I care about my job but you know what and everybody say well it's just a job it's just a job no no because the Bible tells me now may be wrong but the Bible tells me that whatever we do in word or deed we do it as un the Lord right so tell me where I can go a job and get paid for and just like well K SRA Sarah and everybody's like well you know then it's likew what are we going to do about well listen let me tell you what you do from the beginning you start off right you start doing it right from the beginning and if you stay that way then when you finish it'll be right right just like Brother Gary back there building something you know if you say well e eighth of an inch here is okay quarter of an inch there little bit here a little bit there you know what nothing's ever going to work out right because there's only so much that that you can deviate but you know you've got to hold it to the line and it's got to match up all the way through because you can't just cut Corners here or there because when you get to the end then you got a mess on your hand because nothing's going to work right right and it's the same way with the word of God you know all you got to do is start right is that what brother BR said you you start right you go right you continue right he said you end up right and that's all you got to do is continue in the way that God made so when when God made the way he put it in order that all we got to do is continue that way right but that's what God is expecting us God doesn't expect us to you know he realizes that you're human you're going to have faults and failures but the thing is is you've got to come back to the same place listen if you fall and you fail you have sin whatever guess what you go right back to the place where you came from you pick yourself up you you repent you get back up you dust yourself off and you get going again because you can't stop because that's what the devil wants you to do the devil wants you to get to a place and you know you get to a place where you're just having a pity party God you know God wants you to go why because his his the the blood has been shed and it's it'll cover all your sins it'll take care of everything and he's always there with open arms I've never seen him yet in my lifetime when I have fallen when I had a need that he wasn't there waiting on me to come to the place that I needed because most of the times I tried to do things in my own self and I went away from him but you know he was always waiting on me to come back to where he was at when I came back to the word when I came back to a place of repentance he was waiting on me yes sir see if we can do that and realize what God's done for us God has made a way see if you come through that and realize see God has brought the word to us he's called us to this day the day and hour which we live the word has come for our day he spoke to each one of us see what a what a great glorious day that we live in that God's word came it's it's for us that as the scriptures said he excuse me the word Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelation 10 these scriptures you know they don't mean a lot to the world there's a lot of people that don't understand those things but you know blessed are your eyes for they see blessed are our eyes because we see because it came to our for our day that we began to see these things and understand behold I send you Elijah the prophet so these things were given to us for us to understand and receive these things see the word is went for went in our day what' he say see the the message came to us in our day to understand what was taking place it was a fulfillment of the word that we realize that today is the day of salvation and he began to speak to these things you realize what's taken place and you know people have missed the day and hour that the of the of the Lord and you know as the scripture says here as we were reading in the beginning he said but the day of the Lord shall come as a thief in the night you know because you realize you know it's it's a secret coming and you realize that God is speaking to each person individually but he's calling a bride amen you know as as brother R was speaking there you know when is talking about you know the um the the the shout you know the shout was a message that went forth there was a message that went and you know it was to those people it's not to the world but there's a group of people that's predestinated to that and it's to them that they catch the The Voice amen they catch the the the message is to them right and blessed are you and I because we have received that message and realize this is the day and hour see as as they were saying in the beginning see things continue as they were they're not continuing as they were see God has been changing and moving and he's began to unveil himself and there's many people that that have heard these things but you know it wasn't to them and you you look through brother bram's Ministry and he began to speak and he you know through the Healing Ministry and everything and he began to preach a message to the people and he began to show them the word amen and he began to show them the errors of their ways or the denominations and and all the things that were taking place he began to point them back to the scripture and show him this is the Fulfillment of the word of what was taking place and yet they they turned him down because it was because here they they they want to hang on to their own denomination they want to hang on to their own beliefs their own thoughts and here here he was and you know here he began to preach and began to show them all these things and show them what was taking place but there was a group of people they turned down and walked away from these things but there was a group of people that began to hear the word and realize that was that was Eagle food to them it was a word to them it was what they were longing for and they began to catch on to these things and realize this is this is the day and hour this is my word because when he said I behold I send you Elijah the prophet it become it became personal to them to re this is this is personal to me this is what I believe this is the word to me that I'm I'm walking in this I'm I receive this as the word and realizing that what it's doing is it's changing me amen so when you see these things when when they say well you know how things are taking place but I realize the that was what's all this is supposed to take place we're supposed to have scoffers we're supposed to have those that you know because in our mid we're we're going to we're supposed to have the as brother Bob was talking about listen we're supposed to have false anointed ones we're supposed to have all these things take place but as Bob as brother Bob was preaching you know we realize all these things are supposed to take place but he said like he said but Jesus told us the the elect cannot be deceived amen but it's supposed to be so close that it's that it could deceive the very elect to see the condition and the hour in which we live but you know what the word is com in our day to show us where we're standing and for us to be fortified behind the word to realize in the day and hour which we live that you know what we don't we cannot be deceived the Lord because it brings us to a place to real realize who we're where who we are where we're standing and we catch these things and realize because if God was the one that brought us to this place brother Bob if he started us on this journey and he's brought us to this place do you know he's going to carry us all the way that he's going to take us all the way through yes sir because I didn't start I didn't start on this journey on my own I can't keep myself in this in this way it's because all of Because of Him amen you know I put my trust in him because he showed me what to doly and if we realize it's just that childlike Faith to realize that we just hold on right amen amen but you know what what will God do for us as you begin to receive the word you become the word as brother Bob was talking about you you begin to realize who you are you begin to see who you are and you begin to see your position in Christ and you begin to grow in Christ and you begin to things begin to open up more to you and you begin to see these things and what a wonderful time when you begin to see the things that are taking place and you understand where you're living amen you know and it's and it's such a wonderful thing because you you know you realize that when the more God reveals to you and the more he shows you who you are right you realize how how low you are how little you are it makes him everything thing amen amen because there's nothing good in you but what a wonderful job he's that work that he's done in us to bring us to this place I'm so glad that he's brought me to this place that I that I could put my trust in him and realize hey it won't be much longer right well have the musicians come but we realize let's all stand but we realize it won't be much longer God has bringing us to the place that we're going to see the the Fulfillment of these things I'm looking forward to it to see all these wonderful things that God has promised to us see when you see the the condition that the world has gotten into we know what's going to take place I was I was talking to somebody the other day we talking about the you know the condition that the world is getting into and all the you know all these things and you know but you know God made us a promise and you know brother Ram said you know we've seen all of these things all these you know he had seven visions and he was talking about the seven visions of the things that's taking place and you know he said he said that last Vision that he saw he saw America burn over he a smoldering Ash Heap it's done it's it's finished there was nothing left you know and here everybody you know you know what what what what about what about my my 401k and what what about what about my house and what about this and what about that and it's like listen you're fighting over Canon F it's going to be gone now you know that that doesn't mean that you know we just well we're not going we're not going to have a house we're not going we're just going to live like noads or whatever no you've got to live but the thing is is you got to have priorities you know what God fed me every day of my life he's clothed me every day of my life I've had a roof over my head it's kind of kind of odd in there sometimes but we did have a roof over our head the whole time but you know God's always taking care of us yeah but you know what one of these days all this is going to be gone we're not have we don't have to worry about all of this because it's it's not we're not you're not going to take it in the Rapture with you thank thank God you know it's like listen you know we worry about electronics and and all these different things but you know I always tell them thank God that there won't there won't be cell phones and there won't be radios at on the other side when we get out of here there will be a day that you know what we won't need cell phones anymore we won't need radios we won't need all this stuff all of it it it had it had its purpose and thank God for it but you know what there's a time all this is going to be done away with but what what's the most important is the kingdom of God and his word seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you you know because there in and Peter you know he is speaking at the end you know he's talking about the the Earth being destroyed and he said that there comes a day when you know the the elements are going to melt with fervent heat and all this is going to be done away with and we realize you know brother R talking about the Earth will not be destroyed but all the effects and all the things on it and all these things where man has touched will be destroyed and it'll go back to where the way it was and see we we see how all these things are going to take place but realizing you know all this is going to be done with but you know it's all going to be made new and we don't have to worry about it's it going to be a wonderful time to realize we're going to be right back where we were on this Earth and all the sin and all the filth and all these things are going to be do away with as as he was told Brother R was talking about you know he he was making the earth a fit place to live just like just like he made you and I a fit place to be a habitation the temple of God and what a wonderful thing we're going to realize all this is going to be done away with and when when the world's coming into a place and you see all of the condition the world's going to be in chaos and turmoil hey when the bride's gone there's no place to be but you know what we're going to be leaving yes God's made a way for us amen what a wonderful what a wonderful thing to realize I'm going be gone in a twinkling of an eye I'm going to be gone I won't have time to say goodbye I'm going to be gone like that song says I and by be while I'm singing a song I'm going to be gone and it won't be long I'm going to be gone one of these days it's going to be a reality and that's that's my desire I want that to be I'm I'm looking for I I want to be like Bob was saying be so sold out to God that's right I want to I want to be this this is the most important thing the word I want to be changed by the word I want to be I want to be so sold out there's nothing in this world can hold me amen God bless you let's sing a song for a long time I've traveled down
