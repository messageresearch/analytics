just look up on the website they're all there so i'm not gonna spend time reading them but we're gonna go ahead and go to the uh the word this morning and uh let's read it from exodus chapter 25 exodus chapter 25 and uh you know i was trying to get away from the topic of the tabernacle but i couldn't i know brother wade's been on it as well and uh it seems like the lord just maybe wants to say something to us let's find out what he wants to say amen praise the lord jesus um and so let's just uh let's just go to the lord in prayer lord jesus we thank you once again for the opportunity to open back the pages of your word lord to to bring us here father god with expectation in our hearts lord knowing that you are the speaker in this hour lord father god the bride father doesn't have her own voice lord she has your voice lord father god she only says what you say lord jesus she only does what you do lord god and she only thinks what you think father we ask lord jesus that this morning father god let us receive your thoughts father and not father god let us lay aside all the thoughts all of our own thoughts aside and all of the weights and the sins that would so easily beset us lord jesus and let us father god just run this race with patience forgive us father this morning for our sins lord for father god we fail you in many ways lord and many many ways lord we don't deserve nothing father god that comes from you but lord jesus you told us father god to approach you with boldness lord that means father god that is ours and you want us to take it lord jesus and we ask you heavenly father to help us this morning to take what rightfully belongs to us what you purchased for us lord on the cross of calvary lord we love you we commit this time into your hands bless us through your word we pray in jesus christ's name amen amen before we read i just want to say also that i appreciate that appreciate that sunday school lesson brother brother brother john we certainly enjoyed that and uh you know you might not you may not think well what if finance has got to do with my spiritual life it's got to do a lot because because remember the stature of a perfect man is for this outside body right and if we can't if we can't handle if we don't know how to handle money if we don't know how to handle one another if we don't know how to stop lying if we don't know how to how to do those little things stop cheating stop every now and then you know throwing something that's not true you know even if as a joke and things like that then it's got to be the holy ghost working from the inside out right and and so we we we we can think we can think oh all i need is the deep truths of the word and you do need that don't get me wrong but the deep truth of the word will lead you to live a life before others right all right so so so it's very important and i i believe i believe the way you handle your finances god has a way in the bible for you to do that amen so that's what the brother was trying to do and so there's you want the answers to your life they're all in the bible they're all in there every even even even it touches your checkbook it does because because that's how god set it forth amen praise the lord jesus well let's read exodus chapter 25 and let's start at verse 10. it says and they shall make an ark of him wood two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof and a cubit and a half the height thereof and thou shalt overlay it with pure gold within and without shalt thou overlay it and shall make upon it a crown of gold round about and thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it and put them in the four corners thereof and two rings shall be in the one side of it and two rings in the other side of it and thou shalt make staves of in wood and overlay them with gold and thou shall put staves in into the rings by the side of the ark that the ark may be born with them the staves shall be in the right in the rings of the ark they shall not be taken from it and thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which i shall give thee and and this is where i want to concentrate now and thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof and the cubit and a half the breath thereof and thou shalt make two cherubims of gold of beaten work shall thou make them in the two ends of the mercy and make one cherub on the one end and the other cherub on the other end even of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the two ends thereof and the cherubim shall stretch forth their wings on high covering the mercy seat with their wings and their faces shall look one to another toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be and thou shalt put the mercy seat above the ark now you watch the mercy seat was a separate part and we can bring it here in just a moment but a separate part from from the actual ark and thou shall put the mercy seat above upon the ark and in the ark in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that i shall give thee and there i will meet with thee watch and there i will meet with thee and i will commune with thee from above the mercy seat from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony of all things which i will give thee in commandment unto the children of israel praise the lord jesus so you may be seated this morning um i don't know how we can bring this over here maybe just set it we'll set it on the piano the way it used to be praise the lord y'all see that okay all right so before we touch on that let's just read hebrews chapter 4 hebrews chapter 4 verse 14 through 16. it says seeing that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession amen let us hold fast to that that you know that that you have experienced that you learned amen for we have not in high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are aren't you thankful that the lord jesus christ went through exactly what you're going through and probably a whole lot more amen yet without sin verse 16 let us therefore come weekly doubtful wishy-washy no let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace now i want you to i want you to to take a look that in the in the old testament it was the mercy seat now paul calls it the throne of grace that what that we may obtain that mercy and find grace and conjunction so now you just don't find grace you just don't find mercy you find both at the throne of grace that you may obtain mercy and find grace what in the time of your need praise the lord jesus hallelujah amen what what a blessed promise it is amen praise god so i i just want to talk about this morning and i want to tell you that you are cordially invited unto the throne of grace you are cordially invited unto the throne of grace now how many have received an invitation to something special special invitation just comes in the mail and you weren't expecting it maybe it was to a wedding or maybe it was to a a birthday party you know to a little kid you know if they see a a card with balloons or something like i'm invited to my friend's birthday party yay you know that's very special to them you know they take that very seriously and if you say well let let's we'll go ahead and try to make it it's to them it's like you said we're gone so you better watch the words that you even use to your kids when when you tell them we'll try maybe we'll see to them that's we're going i want to go amen but let's say you got invited to something let's say let's say the the the the queen of england invites you to go visit and have dinner with her that would be a very special invitation whatever you think about the queen of england i mean that's up to you i'm just giving this as an example amen that would be a very special invitation right and you would make sure that you er it's it's something that you've never had before and you're going to take full advantage of this invitation amen and you are going to make sure that you are dressed for the occasion you're going to make sure that you are uh you you you've you've got your teeth clean everything is is exactly in order so that you can have this dinner and fellowship with the queen of england praise the lord jesus and and how much more god has given us jesus christ has given us an invitation in this hour let us therefore come boldly amen how many believe that it's god speaking through paul paul wasn't writing his own words that was jesus christ speaking through paul let us come boldly amen unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in the time of need to me that's an invitation that god is ready to meet your need god wants to meet your need god is is more than willing to to have fellowship with you in order so that he can find out what is going on what is happening because i want to meet your need i already done it now let me just go and meet it for you praise the lord jesus hallelujah amen but we see here in the in the in the tabernacle when we're looking here in the tabernacle uh uh um we look here that that that the tabernacle in the old testament uh as you know the the children of israel had to walk around in the desert with the tabernacle and and in the holies of holies i know we've been speaking about the different parts of the of of the tabernacle but in the holies of holies where the shekinah glory would come down and really the word shekinah isn't even anywhere in the bible but it's a hebrew word that that relates to god's presence amen it would come down when the when the children of israel when the high priest would go in there once a year with the blood of the of this of of a bull over over a lamb amen and would sprinkle that blood would go in behind the veil and remember he had to be dressed a certain way he had to he had to look a certain way he had to approach that that that that room in a certain way he had to go in there prayerfully hence that's the reason why he had to approach the altar of incense before he approached in there there had to be that smoke those prayers had to be there before he went behind that veil and so see saints that's the reason why we don't come to god any old way we come to god amen in in shamefulness in in in humbleness and humility in in in in gracious and this knowing that he i i'm at his mercy hey man how do you approach the queen of england what's up queen of england what's up dog what's up bro is that how we come to the queen of england i don't think i don't think even the the the the the biggest thug out there would even approach the queen of england that way no matter how much of a thug he says that he is and and all that amen it just makes me laugh you know some of the kids at school hey man they say they thugs that they carrying lunch trays a thug with a lunch tray and and following orders but yet you a thug [Laughter] but you see you would not approach the queen of england that way there is a reverent way to approach the queen of england there are certain things that you must do certain ways that you must look and so the high priest would approach god in this way he even had to smell a certain way nah think about that he had to even smell a certain way praise the lord and so when he would approach he would he would go back to behind the veil and i'm just trying to paint a picture for you he would have that charger or that charger with the blood amen fresh blood amen and he would go in there and he could not do anything else in there until he first sprinkled that blood on this mercy seat now the mercy seat is discovering i think this opens up there we go now this is the ark the ark is a box now for example in the bible when it mentions an ark for example it was noah's ark right it was a container of something valuables right noah's ark who was contained in it it was valuable people to god amen noah and his family the only ones that believed god in that hour praise the lord jesus that's why it was called the ark it's a it's it's a box it's it's it's a a container of valuables and so that's the reason why this was called the the ark of god amen the ark of the testament the ark of the covenant amen but on top of it was the mercy seat and it was a slab of gold that was separate from the from the from the from the from the ark but it was to cover the contents that were inside and the in the and the priests had to go behind here and sprinkle that blood a certain amount of times he had to sprinkle that blood and when god saw the blood amen then that shekinah glory would come down and that means he would say he accepted there's mercy again for the people for another year now it was called the mercy seat and we'll take it take a look at just a moment what what that is what is the difference between mercy and grace because there is a difference praise the lord and it's very interesting how how god when he started when we were reading here in exodus chapter 25 he starts mentioning in regards to the ark now pay attention he starts mentioning regards to the ark first in order for them to construct it but he starts telling them to construct it but he starts uh with with the ark the actual ark first he doesn't tell them come and construct the outside court first then the holy whole the holy place no he starts with the holy of holies first amen with the ark in other words with the heart of the matter praise the lord jesus that's where he starts telling them to start working working on or at least that's how he explains it there in in exodus chapter 25 which is that's what god does with us amen he's he he doesn't care about how you dress as long as amen he cares about how you dress don't get me wrong or the outsides of it but what he cares most is about getting you right inside first because many people try to get right on the outside get everything right on the outside first and nothing inside has happened and you are just only living a life of hypocrisy amen but when god god starts telling them hey go to the root of the matter first amen and then work yourself out the outside then everything the all the other furniture that piece of furniture god starts talking about first and god wants your heart first your peace that piece of furniture is what god wants first because he knows if he can turn your heart amen then he can have the rest of you amen if he could just turn your heart first not just your eyes i love the song turn your eyes upon jesus but amen let's turn our hearts upon jesus amen because let us we want to look with our heart we want to look with our hearts amen praise god so he always starts with the heart and he builds his way out amen many people that have come to church you know you know it that they have come and been excited and you've seen them change ways on the outside but now they're not here anymore for whatever reason maybe they've moved or something like that but but maybe they've fallen spiritually why because the work wasn't done inwardly first they there was not that inward work there was not that inward thing that happened that inward relationship between god and and and that person and therefore you see them fall off you see people fall off die off get bored never come to church again do everything contrary to to what you what they felt i feel so good i'm so happy about god let's see five years later down the road where they're at that's the reason why sayings you are blessed amen that god has still preserved you even in this hour you you are blessed people that you are still persevering yeah the way hasn't been easy everything has been tough you've had to deal you've had to deal with family you've had to deal with problems at church you've had to deal with all kinds of things maybe troubles at work amen but you are still persevering and it doesn't matter what happens on the outside you are still here because god has called you god has started to work in you god has started to work in you that's the most important thing so now this arkan this ark right here this chest or this coffer because back in that day in the day you know people held coffers and chests in their place in their house and it was to hold valuables right and when you would go visit that your uncle you know during christmas time or during thanksgiving i don't know they didn't have that back then but i'm just saying you go visit your uncle your uncle and uh he'd be like hey son look look what i got here and he'd pull out his ark his his his uh his chest full of goodies and check out this this this this gun i got the other day look at you we went the other way the other day when we was at brother elisha's house i'm sure maybe they're watching in right now he took us down to his basement now over there in lorraine ohio those houses they look they look like they're small but man they got some huge basements i mean up north and i know in toronto where my wife grew up you know they make the houses like that they look small on the outside but under it's a whole new different world [Laughter] brother elisha took us downstairs down to the basement and he showed us all his goodies in his coffer he had guns he had fishing rods he had all kinds of stuff amen because we were his guests and you know what saints god has played had placed goodies in this box right here for the high priest to take a look at amen every time that he went back there praise god he could go and step in and look at those goodies amen and it wasn't just goodies it was it was the the it was the word the commandments amen it was the manna that never spoiled and it was aaron's rod that that butted and then and that would just bring a fresh joy to him once again praise the lord jesus but in this in this arc there were there were there were special things that were stored in there now i want you to think about that in second corinthians chapter 4 verse 7 paul told us this he says but we have this treasure in what in earthen vessels the treasure of christ amen the treasure that god paid for christ paid for now that treasure is not just laying in a box amen that word is not just now in a box that word now is living in jars of clay [Laughter] praise god is now living in a flesh people amen in a body and as i mentioned last time god wasn't just interested in dwelling in in a in a holy of holies and then in solomon's temple and then it not even just pleased although he was pleased but not just pleased with dwelling in jesus because the body of jesus was an ark right now he wants to dwell in a people and he wants a he wants to walk into people he wants to talk through people he wants to live through a people and that's the ultimate saint the ultimate is that god can dwell in a in a sinful a person's heart because he has changed it from the inside out you who are a drunkard you who are a fornicator you who were vile you who were you were all of this and yet god told you to come boldly yes oh god that's mercy and that's grace you don't deserve it i don't neither but he invited us to it and when we don't go amen that's between that that's up to you but the invitation is open the invitation is open praise the lord jesus amen so you can see the mercy seat was only just a cover or a lid right and remember there was blood sprinkled on it air year after year so it was it was blood-stained right it was blood-stained but you see it was only a cover and it could not take the people's sins away it was only just to cover sins it's interesting that god told him to to to place the blood there amen so it was only a cover and no one literally sat on that mercy seat no one physically sat on it even though it was called the mercy seat no one literally sat on that mercy seat amen because it it was just only for the sprinkling of the blood praise god and we're going to get to something here just a moment amen amen hence the fact that sins were only covered amen and they were not done away with amen sins were only covered and not done away with not eradicated they were only covered praise god amen and this mercy seat saints was the only place amen within the ark to obtain mercy amen when the high priest would go in there it was the only place that he had that he couldn't sprinkle the blood anywhere else it had to be behind it would have to be on this mercy seat he can sprinkle the blood on the on the on the altar of incense he couldn't sprinkle the blood anywhere else it had to be on top of this mercy seat in order to obtain mercy amen praise god now i want us to read here in hebrews chapter 10 if the brothers can bring it up hebrews chapter 10 verse 9 watch what paul says here he says dan said he lo i come to do thy will o god he taketh away the first that he may establish the second speaking of the old covenant now he establishing the second covenant by the which will by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all amen and every priest standeth not watch i want you to pay attention to that every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins notice how paul uses the word standeth or standing because there was nowhere when the ch when the priest would go in there and then the high priest would go inside that holy of holies amen there was no seat in that tabernacle none of the furniture there was a chair in there for them to sit at now maybe they might add it later but then that's man involving themselves and adding things in into into god's word that has no business being there that's the reason why we get in trouble sometimes when we add things that don't don't necessarily not in line with his word we get in trouble amen when you add your own opinion or your own chair in there for you to rest on that god doesn't care about your chair amen god wants you to do it according to his word praise the lord jesus exactly according to his word now he says here and so the priest always would have to be standing they'd go in there standing and the high priest would go behind that holy of holies standing offering the whole that blood there on the mercy and he says but this man what man but this man jesus christ after he had offered one sacrifice one sacrifice four sins forever sat down now now why is it that paul is so concentrated on standing up and sitting down see he offered sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of god what is the right hand of god it's the power of god amen from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool for by one offering he have perfected forever them that are sanctified uh how many here are sanctified so you've been perfected right i want you to look at the word and you start confessing yourself in that word putting yourself in that word amen so i want you to take a look here just a moment jesus christ when he went behind the veil spiritually right he didn't he didn't stand amen he sat down for good and what does a king do amen when he sits on a throne when he conquers a a a land when he conquers another country when he conquers a people what does he do in order to to to to to let the people know hey i'm in charge now he sits on that throne he sits on that throne amen praise god now you say oh it's just jesus he's sitting on the throne and he's he's conquered everything he's conquered death hell and the grave and that's wonderful but the thing is saints is that he wants us to sit with him and look what ephesians tells us praise god well if you continue reading there it says from henceforth expecting to his enemies well we already at that for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified and then ephesians 2 verse 4 tells us but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace are ye saved amen aren't you thankful for his grace watch this in verse 6 and hath raised us up together and made us sit together so it's not just god now sitting it's not just jesus christ sitting amen but he is not we are now sitting together in heavenly places in christ jesus do you believe that praise the lord amen we are now sitting together with him in christ jesus in other words the power that he obtained we got the mercy that he is we are we just didn't obtain mercy we are mercy he is not just he didn't just obtain mercy he is mercy amen he is grace i believe there's actually a song that sister brenda lewis wrote that was called we are mercy we are grace amen we are mercy we are grace in this hour he is mercy he is grace he's not just he cannot just provide those things for us but he is those things to us praise the lord jesus amen so the believer now sits and rests with him on that on that seat amen you are just as much powerful as he is you are you have much just just as much right as he does amen that's the reason why he raised when he conquered death and the grave he rose and he said all power is given unto me both in heaven and in earth praise god and did you raise with him when he rose did you die with him when he died amen were you there when he amen in the life yes you were there you weren't physically there but you were there in life praise god in his life because his eternal life right so you are just as much powerful amen as he is now he is not now is he's not just a high priest that went back there one time and offered it and then the good let's wait for another year no he sat down on this he said go ahead and just rent that bell and that that's why that veil was rent amen that's why that village rent from top to bottom signaling that it was god that was doing the work here and it was it's not a man thing praise the lord jesus amen so but the problem that we have and i mentioned this last time is that we like to just sew that thing back up we like to sew that veil back up with our own ideas with our own things with our own opinions and and we're the ones who make a division between you and god god doesn't make the division you make the division because let me tell you when you open that that veil god is still sitting there waiting for you where the way you left them that's the way he's going to be amen the way you left him that's where you'll find him praise the lord jesus amen so and half verse 6 and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace amen you know brother john showed that picture of a of a cake there and it looked nice and rich how many like cake wake up how many like cake how many like some rich cake how many like cake that just chocolate cake that just sort of tastes like chocolate no you like it for it to be nice and chocolatey right hey man i i like i like when i eat a a a candy bar that that that i know it's supposed to be like 90 percent cocoa i want it to taste like chocolate i don't want it to taste like skittles you know i want we're not going to eat something i want it to that that's supposed to be juggle i want it to taste like chocolate amen and when we partake of god's grace when we partake of god's mercy amen the exceeding riches of his grace amen when you go for grace to god you want it to taste like grace amen you don't want it to taste like condemnation you don't want it to taste like you shouldn't have done this you shouldn't have done that and then you want it to taste like grace because that's what you approach god for hey man you when you go for mercy you want it to taste like mercy because that's what you approach god for amen and he wants to give it to you he's ready to give you that chocolate cake amen it's right there come taste the richness of the goodness of the mercy and the grace of god amen can't you see that i'm sitting here i've overcome the devil i've overcome hell i've overcome the grave i'm sitting in my throne and now you can come boldly praise god hallelujah amen he's and that's what he wants us to do because he just doesn't want to sit there on his own he wants us to overcome alongside with him to sit with him you know when you see the queen of england or when you see kings and queens in the past you normally see the king and the queen sitting next to each other that's how god sees you right now god is not looking at your faults god is not looking at your failures god is only looking at the work that he did god is looking at the blood that he's already sprinkled amen shed it wasn't just sprinkled it was shed amen and he's looking amen at the power that i have to free you from whatever problem you have you might say oh i'm i'm i can't go to god i'm i've done so much i've i've i've sinned my way out of grace no you haven't none of us have none of us have because you are still living and breathing you're still here you can't sin too much and you can't fail god too much that his mercy and grace can't keep can't pick you back up the thing is is that we need to come boldly knowing that amen praise the lord so just as jesus christ as i said mentioned earlier just as jesus christ is mercy and grace amen we who are in him and he and us are also mercy and grace we just don't get mercy and grace we are mercy and grace amen by the baptism of the holy ghost so if he's mercy and grace and you have received the baptism of the holy ghost and you are mercy and grace then what should you be what should you do for others well brother so-and-so man he didn't mean wrong sister so and so man i just can't stand the way she she talks to me goodness gracious i just can't stand man that brother man he just choose gum all up in the church house man and uh man i just can't stand the way he does it and the way you you know i just can't amen what about mercy and grace know sometimes we're so quick to just throw it out and shell it out on people and we don't look at ourselves we don't look where we're wrong amen it's somebody else's fault that that that that things are happening the way they are but it's never your fault it's never your fault you don't look at yourself but you look at others i think that's a problem amen you are in need you're standing in need of much more mercy and grace than anybody else just as much i'm not saying more but just as much amen oh we love to condemn but if you say you're a christian and you have his mercy and his grace yet you don't shell it out then who are we are we really christians because let me tell you saying god saved you when you were unsavable i know this is simple amen but let me tell you what amen some of us need that some of us need this you were unsavable you were you were heading to hell just like i was just like any of one of us were you needed just as much of his grace and his mercy and the wonderful thing is is that he's ready to give it to you so you can't send away your day so far that he he he can't provide you mercy and grace or better yet that he can't make you mercy and grace hallelujah amen and he says here that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through christ jesus for by grace are ye saved through faith and not and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god amen if i give uh zach a gift i don't expect for him to return it back to me give it back to me i'm not going to ask him for that again because that was a gift for him praise the lord that's his amen ephesians 1 6 through 7 to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted and i like the way he uses this word he says in the beloved not with the beloved but in the beloved in verse 7 in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of what of his grace now it's not just grace this in the sour saints it's that double double it's that double grace and we'll talk about that here in just a moment praise god so saints this mercy seat right here you notice in this in the new testament is not called it is not called mercy seed anymore amen we reference to it as mercy seat but now it's become a throne of grace so now it's not just the holies of holies now it's a throne room praise the lord jesus all right so going back to hebrews 4 16 it says let us therefore come boldly you know looking at that word it just reminds me of just brother boyd that word boldly brother boyd for the boy's got that bold beard [Laughter] come boldly amen unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy now mercy the mercy the the obtaining of mercy is still there but now as we're coming unto the throne of grace in order to obtain mercy and find grace to help in the time of need zechariah 4 7 tells us this who art thou a great mountain before zerubbabel what thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace unto it amen so i believe that that's speaking of this headstone right so in this hour saints it's not just grace it's double grace well you don't know what sister so-and-so did to me you better apply that double grace well you don't know what brother rubs me off the wrong way every time i look at him you better apply that double grace brother don't even say anything to me he don't even shake his hand he just walked right by me and just amen double grace double grace in this hour because you know what you know what's going to uh what's going to invite people it's your double grace what's going to attract people to jesus christ your double grace it ain't going to be your condemnation or you better do it like this that and the other pow no it's going to be your double grace you know what that man that guy that says who's a crazy christian he is a christian man look look look at the stuff that i do around him and stuff like that and he still treats me right look how much i've failed and yet he's still isn't that god look at you the way you fail him on a daily basis and he still meets my needs and he still loves me and he still supplies everything that i need and he still gives me his word isn't that god amen [Applause] sure there's people out there that don't deserve it i and i was one of them and you were one of them but we need it and they need it and you and i are the only people that can offer it to them if we have the the the if we have that grace in us who is the lord jesus christ so zechariah tells us crying grace grace unto it amen think about this saints when jesus christ died and rose from the grave now you you look at many examples of jesus life with his disciples the three and a half years that he spent with his disciples look at the time when peter was walking on the water amen how god jesus displayed his mercy amen and picked peter off the water even in his unbelieving hour and man we've talked about that and i love that story amen we just had a good time last sunday man i preached about i preached that message come and at their brother gene williams church man and we just had we just had such a good time man and i hadn't had church like that in a long time and it just felt so good they they preach you to death over there but and uh so they um so jesus showed mercy showed grace but but you watch after jesus died and resurrected it wasn't the disciples going to lo go look for the disciple for jesus it was jesus going to go look for the disciples because when he was erected he told he was so concerned about peter he was so concerned about the disciples that he even told mary magdalene he said you go tell peter name them by name go tell them disciples about what you just saw and what happens they're there booing and crying in a room and scared [Music] president biden's gonna raise our taxes [Laughter] oh my look at all this stuff that's going on and jesus just appears before them and says fear not he didn't tell them anything else at the beginning he just said fear not fear not if your taxes get frozen they rise oh well god will make a way amen biting isn't god amen i am god i am god and why i am sitting on the throne remember all power is given unto me both in heaven and in earth amen praise the lord jesus biden never said that amen the cia never said that the fbi never says that the irs definitely never said that but jesus christ in his word said that so who are you going to believe amen his word is our absolute praise the lord jesus he comes in there and he appears before them and he tells them fear not and he goes to them he doesn't wait for them to come to him he goes to them and applies what double grace because because listen peter had denied jesus peter man he was he was gone i mean he was like he was in sin he didn't deserve nothing from him anymore and yet god jesus christ goes to them amen and applies double grace let us take it a step further he leaves them for several days and they go off fishing they say well i don't know if he's going to come back again i don't know if he's going to ever just appear before us again i don't know if he'll ever do that again so i'm just going to go back to doing what i'm doing and i wonder if that's just kind of like us sometimes oh we have one experience with god and then several days have passed and and months pass and you don't see the lord doing something in your life again well let me just go back to doing what i used to do that makes me feel good amen that makes that helps me helps me enjoy my flesh a little bit more amen something fleshly and you know what they went back to fishing and jesus goes to them and meets them where they were at he goes to the shore to the beach and he's there probably watching them and he's cooking fish and and he never went fishing himself they go to the shore they come to the shore and and they're like you know after they realize it was jesus they come to the shore and he's there cooking fish and jesus was never anywhere on the boat with them he just told him you you go ahead and set that that uh to the side and they caught their fish but when they came to the bank he was already cooking fish oh my that's like jesus amen praise god but what was he there for he was there to reiterate that grace to them did they deserve it no they didn't especially peter you know peter means a rock that's a hard man that's a hard person it's hard to deal with hard people but that's who god that's what jesus wanted more that's what jesus wanted more he wanted the hardest case to deal with the hardest case sometimes we give people up so easily when in reality those are the ones who usually come out better than many because those are the ones who truly experienced the grace of god amen praise the lord jesus so jesus applies his double grace there amen amen let's just move quickly amen what is the difference between mercy and grace mercy is the act of withholding deserved punishment so the high priest would come in here every year the children of israel had sinned that whole year but when that blood was applied mercy was applied to the people right so it was mercy is the act of withholding deserve punishment and it was only withholding for for a year every year that priest that high priest had to go back in there to apply the blood but but well watch what grace is grace is the act of giving unmerited favor amen you don't deserve it but i'm going to give it to you i want you to think about that for a moment all right you you know mercy if mercy is god acknowledging hey yeah you sinned you did wrong but you do something and then i'll apply i'll forgive you for that right grace is just unmerited grace amen unmerited favor you don't have to do anything amen you get grace now don't get me wrong amen you you've got to come to god amen in order to obtain mercy and grace you've got to humble yourself amen you've got to ask for forgiveness your mom can't do it and your dad can't do it nobody can do it for you you've got to do it for yourself because you have to experience it for yourself mercy and grace watch are two sides of a coin and the coin is love yeah you have a coin you got two sides they they're part of the same coin and that coin is love amen the love of god praise the lord jesus now i want us to look here in regards to thinking about that now we are sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus we're not standing we're not like the priests anymore standing doing works and and then doing what we're supposed to do you know every year and and i'm going to do it like this and doing that no no no now we are sitting we are what resting together in him right if you read with me in esther chapter 5 verses 1 through 3. now it's so interesting that this this this chapter is the number 5. what does 5 represent grace now it came to pass on the third day that esther put on her royal apparel let me background here if you don't know there was several days several months actually i think that queen esther had not fellowshipped with the king queen esther was was was was a christian i'm just saying i'm bringing it down today right back then there was nothing like that but queen esther had gotten saved she heard the message she knew she was part of the bride she was a queen she knew that but something happened that she lost communication with the king she lost that that that that fellowship with the king i wonder if that doesn't happen to us if we're not careful we are very quick to lose communication with our king and then we're wondering what is happening the king doesn't want to see me anymore now you're making judgments you're making prejudgments that god doesn't want to speak to you that god doesn't want to that you're now in condemnation that now you are not he won't ever forgive you and that was far from the truth that was the things that esther was thinking about because he was saying how can i approach the king now because if i go and approach him now it'll just be dead he won't want to receive me anymore she had not had that intimate time with the king but she just said you know what he told me to come boldly just as he said in hebrews amen and so i'm just going to go in boldly amen that's what the bride says in this hour now it came to pass on the third day that esther put on her royal apparel and stood in the inner court of the king's house just as the high priest would have to put on his apparel to enter into the holies of holies right just as you have to put a certain apparel before you go meet the queen of england amen or somebody important esther had to go put on her apparel before she went to meet the king now remember the king already knew her the king already she was the queen she was part of him right yet she still had to do these things amen in the inner court of the king's house over against the king's house and the king watched and the king sat upon his royal throne remember what did jesus christ do he sat on the throne amen in the royal house over against the gate of the house and it was so when the king wasn't that esther saw but it was when the king saw esther the queen standing in the court see the queen was she was worried she was she was standing when she she should have been sitting next to him but she's standing doing trying to do her own thing amen for months and so when the king saw esther the queen standing in the court that she obtained favor in his sight and the king held out to esther the golden scepter that was in his hand amen so esther drew near and touched the top of the scepter amen that golden scepter is like the the gold the mercy seat amen is made out of gold then said the king unto her what wilt doubt queen esther in other words what do you need queen esther amen and what is thy request it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom i like the difference of this is that god has given us all everything already he ain't going to just give us half amen he's given us everything all power is given unto him both in heaven and earth and if you abide in him and he abides in you all that power belongs to you amen praise god so esther had to come before the king in a certain way and and she was the one that needed grace and there was grace there for her to receive praise the lord jesus amen praise god so how are you coming to him amen it might be months it might you might you have you might have fallen off the wagon so to speak but the king is waiting the king is waiting you don't you don't you just come boldly to the throne of grace look what the prophet says here father we are laying aside now every other thought cleansing our minds and we're coming in thy presence for the cleansing of our soul and we bring before us the blood of the lord jesus we're confessing that we're not worthy of any blessing that you would give us but because that he died that we might obtain these blessings and have told us to come boldly before the throne that we have access to these blessings through the grace of our lord jesus amen who came to earth emmanuel and taken the place of the sinner he became we oh that we might become he watch what he says here what an exchange lord amen a sinful hell-bound life that we had and to know that one came and taken that life upon himself and purged our sins by the shed blood of his own life it's more than our hearts could ever think about lord and then besides all of that he made a way to take away our iniquity and to heal us by his stripes we're so thankful that he promised that he would keep us well while we i guess that's that's all i got there amen praise the lord so there's nothing you have to wait for saints amen if you're having an issue in your life if you're having a problem in your life if you're concerned if you're sick if you're weird if you're tired if no matter what your road is like amen just come boldly to the throne of grace because he not only wants you to just come and kneel before him he wants you to sit with him on the throne of mercy in the un in the throne of mercy praise god if you're if you're having amen condemnation that's nothing to him sickness that's nothing to him amen just come what did he tell peter while he was in the water just come i'll take care of the rest all you've got to do is come amen so if anybody i mean we'll be more than glad to pray for you this morning but if you feel amen that you you need to come amen if you you can do it there in the seat or you can amen wherever at home or wherever amen but just go to him because there's no time to waste amen esther had something urgent there was a uh if you read the story there was a an urgent matter taking place it was the death of her people and right now the death angel is going it's going by amen people are dying people are are getting sick people there's chaos in the land there's no time to play tiddlywinks amen with god it's time for us a man to get serious and approach the throne of god with boldness see fearful amen but with boldness amen respectfully but with boldness boldness is you told me so lord so i'm going to go do it amen i like that story that brother branham says amen if you if i come to your house and you tell me to make a sandwich and stuff like that make make myself a home i'm going to go ahead and do that right i'm going to you say hey the house and the refrigerator everything you get whatever you want from the refrigerator i've been in homes where people have told me that get whatever you want there's now i never do but you see they're courteous but you see you have a right to because they gave you that right so i i i can go downstairs to the you know wherever they put me

oh i see a bag of tostitos there and here's the salsa oh man it's brand new too i'm gonna go ahead and open it because he said make yourself at home and that is what god is telling the saints make yourself at home because this is my home this is my domain this is my power i've overcome this is my place and now i want to give you that same power open up that bag dip and just enjoy amen joy in his blessings amen so you're cordially invited hey man don't don't sit there and die in your condemnation don't sit there and die and you're in your and you're wallering amen just come boldly because the price has been paid everything has been taken care of and now you have freedom in this hour praise god amen let's stand to our feet amen the musicians come amen you know sometimes you forgive us sometimes messages come to us and you have you get you're so excited about when you're writing the notes and everything like that and then and then sometimes you know you might chop it up as you're preaching but amen if you could just get this realization that he wants you to come boldly amen to his throne it's not just the throne of mercy it's not it's a throne of grace it's turned from mercy
