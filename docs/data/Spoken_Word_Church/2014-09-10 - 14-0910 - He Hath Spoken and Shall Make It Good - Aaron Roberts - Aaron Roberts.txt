the name of jesus christ amen amen we're going to be reading from numbers chapter 23 beginning of verse 13. it's one of those things where you you get you get started on some things and you don't know which direction to go so uh we're gonna we're gonna as brother branham said one time speaking about a dentist given a testimony he said lord just fill my mouth with good things and nudge me when i've said enough so that's what we believe in amen numbers chapter 23 beginning of verse 13 and it says and balak said unto him come i pray thee with me unto another place from whence thou may see them for thou shalt see but the utmost part of them and shall not see them all and curse me them from thence and he brought him into the field of zofin at the top of pisgah and built seven altars and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar and he said unto balak stand here at thy burnt offering while i meet the lord yonder and the lord met balaam and put a word in his mouth and said go again unto balak and save us and when he came to him behold he stood by his burning his burnt offering and the princes of moab with him and balak said unto him what hath the lord spoken and he took up his parable and said rise up balak and hear hearken unto me thou son of zippor god is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent hath he said and shall he not do it or hath he spoken shall he not make it good behold i received commandment to bless and he hath blessed and i cannot reverse it he hath not beheld iniquity in jacob neither hath he seen perverseness in israel the lord his god is with him and the shout of a king is among them god brought them out of egypt he hath as it were the strength of a unicorn surely there is no enchantment against jacob neither there any divination against israel according to this time it shall be said of jacob and of israel what hath god wrought right amen god bless you may be seated lord bless the reading of the word yes this evening speaking tale of thought from verse 19 and it says he said god is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent hath he said and shall he not do it or hath he spoken and shall he not make it good and you know we know that god has spoken god has spoken and he will make it good and one of the things that you look at when you when you start looking at israel in their journey you know god brought him out of out of egypt and he's and he started them out and he promised them he said you know because he made a promise to abraham that that your seed would journey in a land but he said they would come out and you know he promised you know israel that they would come out and you know they they were down there suffering under the task masters but you know hey god in time brought them out because he promised the word to him and they and they came forth from eat from egypt and you know he started in the journey but then you know as soon as as soon as the joyous occasion of coming out wore off then they started to murmur and complain against god and you know it just started this this process of moses trying to carry the children of israel into the land and you know god was trying to show them and bring them to the place that he promised them and you know it was just a battle that moses had to go through the whole time but you they were coming through the through the land and you know god told them that when they when they come through these places god told them you may be going through this area but you're not of this place you're not of this land and that and they were supposed to stay separate from the people that they associated with because they were only passing through because just as we are we're just passing through you know we're we're not we're just pilgrim and strangers here we're just passing through this world because we have a better place to go to because we have a place that our builder and maker is god and we have a place that you know because we see the condition that the world is in today and you know you know i've gotten to the point now where you know it it gets tiresome just listening to the radio because you know it just becomes it's just the same thing over and over and over and everybody has the same same thing over and over and over it's just this group is trying to do this and this one's not doing anything and it's just you know just a continual just a mess and you just continue just you know after a while you listen to about five minutes of it and you got to turn it off because you can't handle any more because you know it's so bad but you know i'm so glad that i have that i've heard the good news because there's something that that because i know that one of these days that this body this mortal is going to take on immortality and it will be changed in a moment and tweaking it of an eye and then i'll be leaving here and then because god has promised me something that i that i can look forward to because i know and god has told us what these things are going to take place so when we see these things we're supposed to look up because our redemption draweth nigh because you know this is a rejoicing time but you know we see how these things are and they're supposed to continue to get worse and sometimes you wonder how in the world can it get worse well then you just look you just live a while and you just watch the news a little bit and you find out it does get worse but you know it's so thankful because we know that we're in this time but god is bringing a because when satan is on the move and he satan is doing all that he's going to do and he's fulfilling his plan then god's fulfilling his plan because he has a has a body because he said he would have a church he said he would have a bride without spot or wrinkle or any such blemish well you know what you and i are those people and you know whether we believe it or not you know what it has been spoken to you and he said he shall make it good he said has he not never said anything and shall he not do it well guess what he's going to do it well because there's somebody's going to fulfill that word that's going to be without spot without blemish without anything what is going to be perfect before him why because if you're looking at yourself yes you're going to have problems but you know what i'm looking at my sacrifice i'm looking at an atonement because that atonement covers me because he's got to look through the blood to see me and see god brother random said that grace he said grace provided for them in the journey he said it provided the the fiery serpent and when you when we go back you look at numbers chapter 21 and there when he starts talking about the journey you know here they are god's feeding them he said god gave him manna he fed him he took care of them and they're out there saying we loathe this light bread well because it you know you look at it was such a miracle that they received manna every morning to feed them and it tasted like honey and i can't believe why somebody would hate that right but you know what they they load those things but brother adam said it was grace that provided the the fiery serpent that was the pillar of fire at night and the cloud by day and all the things the water from the rock and all those things that came forth they were they were uh the grace of god before them but you know what they they uh they turned it down but he was bringing them along and you know god was bringing them through the land but he told me you say separate from these and you know god was going to lead them through you don't you don't stop you just keep going through and when you see when you come into the land he said you'll utterly destroy your enemies right why because he promised that he said you will utterly destroy your enemies well you come to numbers chapter 21 and you come in there and you know they're passing through the land and they were coming through the land of the amorites and and zehn was that was the king at the time and you know they wanted to pass through and and israel sent out their messengers and said can we pass through the land so we're not going to drink your water said we're not going to turn into your fields or your vineyards but we're just going to pass through the land and you know what he said no he said you're not coming through my land why because he was against them he hated them he didn't want them to have anything to do with them and when they started to get too close he attacked them but you know what god had spoken to him and said you will utterly destroy your enemies and what did he do when they were attacked israel to wipe them off the face of the mouth and when the scripture says that they dwelled in the lands of the amorites one because they were attacked but god had promised them that they would they would utterly destroy them and that's what they done and because because of that we know that as we as you go through the book of numbers we know that later on balak rose up and balak saw what took place and it put fear in his heart and you know he come to attack them and he had to find some way to overcome the israel the children of israel as they were passing through and you know that's the reason that when he saw what had taken place that's the reason he rose up and he had to find somebody to fight israel right and that's the reason he got of a hold of got a hold of balaam oh yeah and he wanted balaam to come out there and you know he started speaking of balaam and he said balaam you know he wanted them to look and and find a way to curse him right and he kept looking and he you know he said he couldn't find anything why because he couldn't find iniquity in them he couldn't find anything wrong with them why because they were walking with god and you know he kept going through and he kept saying well you know i'll bless you more if you'll just curse them if you'll curse them you know i'll give you more they like want to bless him and and give him all kinds of stuff you know brother ram talking about balaam you know he said he was a harling prophet you know he done it for money he had greed but you know he couldn't find any way of bless of cursing them and in the process of trying to curse them he ended up blessing them all right and you know and then then he said well go do it again go curse them again end up blessing them again and that's the reason why we read in the scripture here you know that balaam was speaking to balak and and when he laid out the offering and the burnt offerings and he was saying he said that you know he said i can't curse him because he said what god has already blessed i can't curse but he said he said because i can't reverse it he said they've already been blessed amen and he said even even when that when he tried to curse him he ended up blessing them and that scripture tells us that baalik become livid at balaam because every time he tried to curse him he blessed them right right and you know he finally got to the point where he said don't bless them and don't curse them why because he got tired of cursing trying to become a blessing he said don't even do anything but what was it he started to lay out a plan to get to get to the children of israel but you know what they were blessed they were so blessed that you know what it didn't matter what came against them they were still blessed and you know that's the way you and i are we're so blessed that we're walking through no matter what comes our way we're blessed just as they were they were blessed but you know what they got to one place and balaam had laid it out there and all of a sudden because of their because of the uh idols you know they got too close and it said they they dwelt in the in the in the planes there and when it's when that took place they were just stationary and they started having a fellowship with them why because balaam told them said oh we're we're just like you are we're just like you well you know there's a difference in being like somebody and being somebody you know the you know in school you know they always told us about being a what's the difference between a metaphor and a simile you know they say you know they'll say all all the world's a stage and we each play a part you know that because you know they they talk about being something but then they say something is like something yeah well as soon as you say i'm i'm like something well then you're actually saying i'm not that right right because you're saying just like just like you know the the famous the famous saying is life is like a box of chocolates well you know it's not it's not a box of chocolates but it's like that well you know satan said that i'm going to be like the most high i will receive worship and be just like almighty god but you know what he couldn't be but he said i'm going to be like him and so he said we're just like you well that meant that he's not right that was the first thing was that he came and said oh we're fundamental you know we had our seven altars and we worshipped in all these tight things you know they stayed long enough to listen to the message and they listened to it and when it came along then he said oh we got you now because all of a sudden they started bringing in idol worship and you know what they got too calm and comfortable where they were and the next thing you know they were out worshiping with the idols and eating things sacrificed to idols and god had told them you just keep moving through because they had a place to go to but you know what ended up costing those people their lives because they got comfortable where they were so we have to be careful about where we go but you know we're we're blessed but we have to stay behind the word there's a place for you to stay just like they were and you know there's a there's a there's a way that that we must go you know that one of the things that when the when the children of israel were passing through you know they said they told them when they wanted to go through the land they said you know we're not going we don't want to be in in other areas we don't want to be in your vineyard we don't want to be in in your in your fields we don't want to take park near water he said we had one place that we want to go the scripture says they said we want to be on the king's highway we just want to be right there and that's where they ought to be was right on the king's highway and sister joyce liked that because she likes that song it's a highway to heaven none can walk up there but the pure in heart because you know there is a highway and it's not a wide way but it is a highway because why because god has standards and there is a highway and you know when when brother branham told the told the uh vision i think is his mother was had the had the dream about the woman and the high-heeled shoes and she come along and your brother branham was telling her said sister you can't walk this way dressed like that and those in those shoes you can't make it this way and she said oh yes i can and she tried to climb those steps up onto the road and you know she couldn't make it and he kept telling her but you know she only went just a little ways and then she fell off and he said you know you heard such horrible screaming as she was falling and you know because why because god has a high way because there's a there's a way to get up there and you can only go by his way and he wants you to walk in that way you know he said it was justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost to come up into his way and he has a way that he wants you to go and he said as the scripture says you know there is a highway i believe it is in in isaiah that tells us he said even even a fool even if a fool was aryan you know he can still make it because you know what it's so simple god will lead you amen it's so it's so simple that even even no matter how most illiterate person in the in the world can understand the message can understand and have a relationship with god that he can lead you and guide you in all truth there's a way to go so we have we have this way to go but you know what we are we are blessed in this way and you know there's many people that have that have walked this way and they've ended up in a lot of different places but you know what god has a way for you and god and it doesn't matter how you how it looks in the beginning it's way it is in the end because you know a lot of people have started on on a journey and and you know just as they come out of egypt they started out really good but you know what those that were in the desert in the wilderness you know what they become dissatisfied with things but you know what they were two of them mo joshua and caleb why because they kept their eyes on the prize the whole time they saw what the end result was going to be and you know it didn't matter how they got and how much problems they had they still had their eye on the goal and they were still waiting to get in and even after caleb had went all those years and had to put up and see all the things that he had to see you know what he never lost his zeal for his for his promise for the promised land for him to go to his portion of the land never got tired he always kept thinking about that and even when he was so old and everybody thought you know caleb you need to sit down and rest he said i'm just as good as i was when i walked through the land and i saw the promise with my own eyes and he walked through there and he told joshua he said give me my mountain why because he still was standing out there sharpening the sword because whoever was in his way he was going to kill him he was going to cut his way through why because it was his promise you and i have a promise but you know what you've got to claim your promise because if you don't claim it you know what it's as good as giving it to the devil but you know there's many things that the prophet had to say and you know if we look at what what the prophet said in the message you know it amaze us it'll amaze us what the promises of god to us are i found i was reading the other day and something stood out to me now now when i do quotes i feel sorry for the brothers in the back because i don't ever do anything in order and they said we don't believe in organization so i don't believe in organization i get there sometimes but most time i don't but you know this is from revelation chapter one i'm sorry revelation chapter 4 1960 12 31 and he's talking about our because our cousins all dressed up and he said he said they do wrong thing too he said but there's nothing hurt about it you see they're kind of classy said you don't hear about that he said but let some pentecostal minister make a mistake one time and brother i'm telling you they'll packer across the country in every newspaper yes sir let some pentecostal brother pray for a child and it dies every newspaper in the country will pack it divine healing is fanaticism well then why don't one why not put every case in the paper that the doctor loses sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander see so if they would do that they wouldn't have enough room in the columns of the papers to ride all the dead right if i go out here to the graveyard and say everybody that ever died under divine healing stand up and then say everybody ever died under medical treatment stand up would outnumber them a million to one that's exactly right so they're going to criticize one and criticize the other so that's right but they kill a million a year with medicines and operations and you never hear a word about it you know i thought that was amazing i read that you know what people got there got their confidence in a doctor yeah how many people want to take a mig into one odds you saw you talk about people where people got their confidence you know what anybody that's actually ever believed god and had faith show me one person that where it's ever failed right brother bran was talking talking about having a prayer line said this woman would come through and she was on crutches and they were they had a place where they were laying them all down and putting all their their wheelchairs and everything to the side and he was talking to that sister and she come through and and he told her he said well sister he said you know if you believe he said just walk right over there and lay your crutches down yeah he said just throw him off down there and she said well brother branham i've been on him for two years he said sister if you believe just throw them down yeah well i've been on them for two years throw them down but you know what he said she didn't have faith but she stood in the line but she didn't have faith and he said next thing you know she just walked off on those crutches hey this little grandmother walked up there and said somebody had to help her get up there and she got up to brother branham and brother branham said sister he said just go over there to the pile and just throw your crutches down said they had to help her get over to them crutches where them piles were but when she got over said bless her heart she could barely move her arms to get him up on the pile but she got him up there and as soon as she laid him down said she went running through the building do we look at do we look at our circumstances or we look at what god's saying you know the thing is i think god i had a i had to have a i broke i chipped a tooth the other day and had to go to the doctor yes the dentist yesterday and the dentist told me said your jaw's gonna hurt and he gave me some medicine and you know pain medicine he told me take this and you know do exercises and he kept telling me all this well i took i took his medicine yesterday and last night but you know when i got up this morning i didn't hurt i didn't what my jaw wasn't sore i didn't have any problems with it but the doctor you know if i could have listened to the dentist no listen i could have woke up this morning my face would have been swollen and i couldn't make nothing but soup but you know what i got up this morning you know i didn't have a bit of problems why because you know i could have listened to what he said but i didn't nothing bothered me why because i have i have the confidence to believe that i you know by his stripes i'm healed well if that's true then you know what i'm still going to eat what i want to but you know a lot of people don't listen to the doctor they take they take whatever's said and they believe it but you know i'm going to stand with i got confidence in and things more than 100 and 100 to 1 odds well i thank god for science i thank god for medicine but you know what it has its place right but you know what it's not going it's not going to it's not going to be the cure-all it's not going to be the fix-all because you know what they're they're only so limited in what they can do and they can tell you so much but after that you've got to have some place to put your faith have put your confidence or what are you going to do you know this man they had a had a man one time brother was telling about and said they got up there he had brain cancer you know they they told him said well listen sir said we're gonna have to take out so much your brain and it's gonna affect this part of your fun you know your speech and you know you're gonna have problems with this and you're gonna have problems with that and all these type things and they'll take this part of your brain out you're gonna have this and and all these type things and he's uh-huh he said well they went through and they took all that out and said you know what he got up he walked he talked he could remember yeah and he said why was that he said well i was just too stupid not to believe him he said well an educated person won't believe what the doctor told him doctor told him you wasn't going to remember nothing you couldn't walk he's going to be a vegetable he's i'm thinking well you know what he just went over and done about his business right sure he said i walked in talking i walked out talking but you know what he could have took that and said well you know what i'm just gonna give up and you know i'm just gonna be a vegetable but you know what it because it's by you what you say by yours by your speech by your faith by your confession is what what takes place and you can you can walk because you know what everywhere you turn in every aspect of your life everything is going to be negative there's there's nothing there's nothing going to be positive but you know what there's one place positive and that's in christ because you know what he said he said that the son of god he said he's got a positive hold on calvary and calvary's got a positive hold on him well if calvary's got a positive hold on me then everything that was purchased at calvary is mine and i can hand it hand to it and and receive it and then it's mine and the devil can't take it away from me whatever i have need of i can draw from an inexhaustible fountain of christ and i can receive whatever i have need of because everything that was given to me was given to me in the new birth everything i needed for this earthly journey was given to me when i was born again well if that's true then when that right now i have everything that i have need of inside of me but he said all you got to do is drink and push out but there's an inexhaustible fountain that you can tap into all through the scripture god has spoken to people speaking in in times that that look it look amazing and we're just you know when we're at their worst but god spoken and told them what was going to take place what would happen all through the scripture you know and you're looking and when things happen in your life you know how do you respond to those things how are you going to respond when things happen in your life right and you know there's many there's many things that i wanted i want to look at some different things and i had some different message i was trying to figure out which way to go and you know but i've been reading a little bit about about david and you know david had a desire when he was with nathan you know he said he said i dwell in in the house of cedar and he said the lord he said he dwells in the curtains he said he dwells in a tent and he said why not he said i want to go out and build him a a house i want to build the temple right he said i had a desire and nathan said he said david he said you you're the servant of god he said he said do whatever's in your heart to do but you know he walked out there and then when nathan walked away god come and told nathan he said go tell my servant david he said you'll not build me a temple right he said he said i brought you out of the sheep coat he said i've made you a great name in the world he said i brought you from nothing and he said i made you everything he said well even when saul turned away from me he said i made you and you're a man after my own heart he said but you're not going to build that temple you know it's so amazing you know he could have got he could have gotten very despondent about that he could have got very down because god told him said do not build that temple but you know what he told him he gave him a promise he told him he said the sun that which will come out of your loins will build the temple he said there's a son he said the son of david will build it right brother branham said it was a type of christ coming in the end time what what he said when he come what's he going to do he's building a spiritual temple a tabernacle for him to live in amen but you know what david could have gotten upset he could have got down about it but you know what he done he went out there and he got enthused why because the temple was going to get built he could have got he could have been upset but he rejoiced in what was going to take place and he went out there and you know what he hired men stone masons to form the rocks the stones that would make up the temple he went out and got the wood and he got the men and all the silver and gold and all the things why because he started laying everything out and then he went to his son solomon before his death and started telling him and you know that was the one thing that he done was he encouraged him and you know he got he told solomon he said you know build the temple you know what because he wanted solomon to have the same desire that laid inside of him for that temple he wanted him he wanted to have the same zeal and you and i we can have the zeal but you know what we need to teach our children to have the same kind of zeal that they can see the seal in us that they need to have in their life that they can want to build up a spiritual tabernacle under jesus christ why because you know what if you don't do it and i don't do it you know what the devil's going to be right there to snatch them up when he said when when when the enemy comes in like a flood he said the spirit of god will raise up a standard well you know what you and i are that standard well because young people will get washed away they'll get carried away i was speaking to a man that i worked with his wife was telling me about a young girl and you know she's had she's had a rough life and she's she's in a mental institution now and and she was asking me to pray for remember this little girl name was michelle and you know he was she was telling me about the life that she had to live and you know her mom was a very abusive to her and and all these type things and now she's just gotten to the point where she don't want to be around people she she's against everybody and you know she was in there and they said you know she got she was whatever with her aunt and uncle which is their next-door neighbor and you know because because her uncle was was her mom's brother you know it that the uh the anger that she had toward her mom she put on her uncle and so anytime she wanted to lash out she couldn't she couldn't see her mom she couldn't lash at her but you know what she done that to her uncle yeah and it was always and you know and he tried to do everything that he could for and you know it was just on and on and and you know finally she just got out in the yard and they have young kids and she just got out in the yard and slit her wrists and and you know they end up putting her in a hospital and everything but you know she said she she's so she because of why the way she grew up the things that she saw and faced growing up she don't know how to any way to get rid of that why because it's so bottled up in her and then and you see this and now she's in a mental institution well the only thing she needs is god because you know it's just it's just the devil it's the way he works but you know young people the devil's out there he comes and he's going to steal kill and destroy he can take everything that he can but you know if you and i have to have to raise up and be a be that standard we have to show them the zeal because you know what if they don't see it in us who are they going to see it in because you know brother brown said you know you can't have you can't have a counterfeit can't have a counterfeit dollar until you have a genuine dollar that's right but that's one that's all satan's ever going to show you he's going he's going to show you the counterfeit you know i remember growing up and you know it seemed like every time you turn around there's there's people in in the church there's people in the message they're all time fighting and arguing and bickering and it's just and you think my lord where's the where's god in all of this and people can you get discouraged i remember as a kid you know you look at some of the stuff what is this but you know what that's what god that's what the devil wants you to focus on one because that's where that's where satan is going to be right there in the message he's going to be right there amongst everybody he said in every in every crowd you're going to have the believers the unbelievers and the make-believers he's going to be right there brother adam said in in christ the mystery you know he was talking about waxing closer together he said love one another loved one lover above everything else he said he said you know because you know he said he'll bring somebody in under the quietness and everything and he said he'll bring that person in he said he'd shoot him full of deadly poison he said don't take sides with that why because that's his job to do that he's going to be doing that it's going to be all over the place but you know we can get discouraged about it or we can realize hey we need to be our children's holy ghost until they get their own but you know we need to make sure that they see god in us that's not it's not just some quote it's not just some book it's not some picture but it's a life because that's what that's what i want ever my kids to see i want i want them to know who god he is i don't i want them to know that god is just some something we talk about i want some i want them to be somebody that's real to them that's right you know not too long ago i tell you this not too long ago adam you know every time he gets sick he gets hurt you know daddy prayed for me daddy pray for me he wanted me to pray for him and so you know we we pray a lot and but you know he was he was sick the other day and he ran the favor and nauseated real bad and everything like that you know and then he got in there told sarah he was going to pray and they're praying for himself he's in there praying for himself in the bathroom and you know he went in there and he'd been so nauseated and it just i mean it just tore him up bad and and y'all forgive me for what i'm saying but i want you to understand it he went in there and he he was praying and when he got done he was in he was in the bathroom he just been so sick and he'd been in the bathroom and he was standing there and he got finished praying he said bye-bye puke he was done with it or because he believed and that's the way it was he believed that when he got done praying that god would touch him and then he said bye-bye i'm done with it and that's the way it's got to be whatever you have whatever your problem is you got to do the same thing you got to separate yourself when you pray and lay it on the altar of god you say bye i'm done with it i'm not carrying this anymore i'm not going to let this hinder me anymore but you know we can still carry that around say well you know i took it to the lord i'm still packing it well that's not what we're supposed to be doing there's a lot of things people people they carry the carry their burdens with them right well they should have laid them down you know that little story talking about the about the the man that wanted the child wanted the daddy to fix the toy for him he said daddy why don't you fix my toy and i keep asking you to fix it he said son how can i fix it he said you never let it go you know because he kept holding on to it he kept holding on to it there you know he never was going to give it over he well daddy you can fix it but i'm gonna hold on to it yeah i'm gonna hold on to it you can fix it yeah right well don't fix it don't work that way until he gave it over to the daddy and said it showers you you take care of it then he was able to do something about it but if we hold on to it and get in god's way he can't fix it he can't work it out he's we stand in his way but david went back to david when when he went through all this and had that zeal and laid out all the things for them to build the tavern built the temple you know he had that desire and he gave it to solomon and solomon was building the temple but you know he come through and you know was laying out all these things and second second chronicles 6 10 the scripture of solomon speaking says the lord therefore hath performed his word that he spoke and for i am risen up in the high in the room of david my father and am sent on the throne of israel as the lord promised and i have built the house for the name of the lord god of israel see because he knew he said god spoke it and god and he was going to perform it right and see it was just him being there it was the instrument that god worked through but you know what he said god build it amen that i that you know because it was what god said and he rose up to to build it amen that he just worked through solomon to build it and they had that god had had done that for him thank you lord right and you know we just have to be faithful in what we do god just wants us to be faithful god wants us to be faithful in his work right you know there's there's many things that happen that but god wants us to be faithful you know in the in the book of daniel when daniel was speaking and you know he said that you know they they've been in bondage for 68 years and then they had two more years that they would be coming out of bondage and and god was speaking to to daniel and you know he prophesied and told him he said you know that in time he said that they'll rebuild the wall and the streets would be rebuilt he said even in troubles times but you know there came a time that when you read in the book of ezra and nehemiah you know they rose up because they they saw that the land of their of their kindred that their fathers had come from that it laid in waste and you know that rose up something in them to go rebuild it and you know they went to they went out and started to rebuild this and you know you look at what they had to do but god told them he said you're going to rebuild this and you know you look back and go back and when he spoke that they would rebuild it go back and look how they had to rebuild it what does the scripture say they had stood with a sword in one hand they're working with the other they had people that was guarding them while they were working the whole time why they had but they had a promise to rebuild the word had been spoken but you know what it wasn't easy but they had to rebuild something rose up in them to do that and you know even when you go back and you start reading in the book of ezra when they come up there and the and the uh the enemy the scripture says that the enemies of believers benjamin and gad were there and then you know they rose up and they said you know we come to help you rebuild we want to be part of you with your god we want to worship your god and all and these type things we're saying unto them and then they turned and said no said you have nothing to do with this this is ours not yours and you know when they walked away then they become then they become the end because you know at first it looks so good we want we want to be we want to help you we want to be your friend that's exactly the way that the devil works see they were they said no you're not because you're not a part of us you're not one of us you're not in this work this is ours this is the land of our fathers this is ours so you're not going to have anything to do with it see they could have went in there and said oh yeah praise the lord we got more help and it just been nothing but a big hindrance it'd have been the way the devil worked he said you know you turn them out next thing you know what they do if they if they really wanted to help then why weren't they staying out of the way the next time they rose up to fight against them here they are out fighting against them trying to trying to defeat what they're doing trying to tear it up but you know what they rose up and they stood there and they had to fight their way through but you know what they build it right they rose up and build it see all the way through the scripture it may not be the way that you want it to be but you know it's the way god has it laid out right because you know you say you're more than a conqueror then guess what you got to conquer something right you've got to overcome but you got to be more than a conqueror you've got to overcome boy we say well we've seen that we've been made more than a conqueror well then you got a then you gotta be more than a conqueror and if you're gonna do that it's gonna be more than just getting by within the skin of your teeth see it it's all these type things but you know you've got to come through that you've got to overcome that but you know what it's been spoken and if it's been spoken that it's going to come to pass all right now i want to read a read a scripture here and they don't have this one either but we're going to read ezekiel 37. i'm going to read this ezekiel chapter 37. it's a valley of dry bones of vision but i like this scripture and i'm just going i want to start verse one and just work my way through but it says the hand of the lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones and caused me to pass by them round about and behold there were many in the open valley and lo they were very dry and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and i answered oh lord god thou knoweth and again he said unto me prophesy unto these bones and say unto them o ye dry bones hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord god unto these bones behold i will cause breath to enter into you and you shall live and i will lay sinews upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and you shall live and ye shall know that i am the lord so i prophesied as i was commanded and as i prophesied there was a noise and behold a shaking and the bones came together bone to his bone and then i beheld lo the sinews and flesh come upon them and skin covered them above and there but there was no breath in them then he said unto me prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of man and say unto when thus saith the lord god come from the four winds o breath and breathe upon these slain that they may live so i pray for so i prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived and stood up on their feet and exceeding great army amen so he spoke unto and was speaking of that you know he could see these these bones and your brother brown spoke i believe it was in the restoration of the bride tree you know he was speaking of those four stages of of resurrection of restoration you know and he said you know each one of them came to their into the bones and the sinew and the skin came upon them but he said you know there was no breath in them and you bet you know he had but he said he's god spoken to him and he said he said you prophesy and he said that the bones will come together he said the sin you will come on them the flesh shall come on them and he said then i will breathe into them but you know what he said he said when he said i'll breathe into him but then he turned around and said son of man prophesy to the four winds that they'll come upon them and that's what he said he said that he said he prophesied and he said and they and the breath breath of god came into them and they rose up and he said they become an exceeding great army then said unto me son of man these bones are the whole house of israel verse 11. behold they say our bones are dried and our hope is lost we are cut off from our parts see there's a prophecy that's their confession we're cut off he said therefore prophesy and say unto them thus saith the lord god behold all my people i will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves and bring you into the land of israel and you shall know that i am the lord when i have opened up your graves on my people and brought you up out of your graves he said i shall put my spirit in you and you shall live and i shall place you in your own land then shall you know that i am the lord have pur have spoken it and performed it saith the lord you know they said that they were they were cut off they were dried up they were dead but you know what they've been spun and spoken to him and all and all the things that they had went through they said they were you know all these things that happened to him and they looked and they said we have no hope but you know what god had spoken to him and he said and then and look and look what he said he said prophesy he said because i said they'll come together he said they'll stand up he said when my breath comes into them he said they'll be an exceeding great army so here they are but they say oh we're going to we're in such bad shape but you know what he had prophesied to them that they would stand up that they would come together that they and he said i will put my spirit in you my spirit will be in you and there was that great stand and the great standing army there and you know brother branham said he said when the bride recognizes who she is he said then she'll be an invincible army but you know what you've got to believe that amen but you know why because he spoke that and you can say well i've got you know i have no hope and you know everything looks so bad or whatever but you know what you're an exceeding great army right amen that's who you are you're that spiritual israel that's raised up see god doesn't it god sees you one way you may see yourself some other way but god sees you the way he sees you which is through his word what he has spoken of you that's how he sees you right but you have to believe that and you know what when they heard the word of the lord he said then they started to come together they started coming together and then they rose up and that's who you and i are we've heard if we if we hear the word of god if we hear the word of the lord then you know we come together we can come together and raise up and be an exceeding great army see the the scripture is so full of things it's so full of things that speak to us but you know you can receive it but you got to believe it you got to believe who you are right there's a couple other things i want i want to share with you and you know this this one always has stood out to me and and and i love it this is from the message letting off the pressure and brother ram was speaking he said i met a woman here sometimes some years ago in the 10 cent store said she was about 60 years old looked about 30 years old and i said how do you do it sister she said brother brandon i've got two sons that's doctors that's older than you are and honest to goodness she didn't look over 30 years old she said here here's what it was when i come to christ when i was about 12 years old i sat down and thought about it and studying other religions and when i found out the truth when i come to christ and took my case my soul my all to him she said i've never had a worry since now he promised to take care of me take care of all my troubles and said if he's not big enough to do it i know i'm not big enough to do it so what's the use of me worrying about it see that's it christ promised that he'd take all your cares cast your cares on him so what are you worried about worry builds up pressure pressure blows up so cast your cares on him and quit worrying heard somebody say one time you know talking on this you know people spend a lot of money trying to trying to fix their their outward appearance you know you know there's there's all kinds of serums and shots and potions and everything else you can think of that people won't try but you know the bible says that you know there's something that that said a merry heart does good like a medicine brother brahman said worry this woman right here you know she went to christ she gave her she gave it all to him where he never bothered her she wasn't full of worry she had something she had a place to anchor to her and heard somebody say one time said you know there's people spent all this time looking for all these things to put money into they got to buy stuff and all this tops these things and sister monica you forgive me for saying this but i know she's in the oils and stuff but the scripture says there's the oil of joy somebody said one time said people like to spend a lot of money women like spend money on everything like that you know what he said the oil of joy is better than the oil of olay people spend a lot of money on a lot of things but you know what if you've got something inside of you it'll come out it'll manifest itself that's right you know what if you've got something bubbling up from the inside you can't contain it right i'm so glad that we have something to turn to but there's something that you can hold on to just like that woman she found something that she could put her absolute in let off the pressure she'd have no worry if god can't take care of it i sure can't take care of it myself there's no me if he's not gonna worry you know why should i worry about it if he said he cast all your cares on him then why should i why am i worried about it i cast him on him he'll take care of it you know the bible's so full of good things you have to get in there and find them find those things that speak to you every every need that you have has been supplied every every need has been met everything that we have need of is is ours but you've got to claim them and the devil's going to be right there the devil's going to be right there to try to hinder you he's going to try to take it away from you but you know what you are more than a conqueror through him that loved us amen god bless you we'll we'll stay and have the

about being able to get out and go and do it and give some medicine this afternoon amen remember nanny you got suggestion but lord take care of that she's already over in turkey and father for business and she'll be gone seven days amen remember their daughter you know one other thing i just want to share with you you know reading you know you start a thought whether i'm saying you know a word is just a thought expressed you know you start with a thought and it becomes a word and then that word becomes an action and your actions determine your destination it all starts with what you're thinking and what you so you have to start in your mind you know brother brown said that most of our faith was mental faith but he said if you add if you pour in the word into your middle faith you become a spiritual revelation you know the thing is people ask you know it it may i guarantee it it'll make make your day better it'll make everything better it does my people ask me how i'm doing every day i'm doing fabulous fantastic wonderful went to we went to cracker barrel the other day and the lady asked me how i was doing i told her fabulous she said that's the best answer i've got all day i tell you what you always find you can always find the negative but you can always find the positive you know people ask me when you walk in the door at work how you doing i'm doing wonderful exciting day here at tag yeah i have another fun exciting day here at work people want to look at you kind of funny sometimes yeah well it's based on what you believe you confess that you'll have a good day you can make things happen it's all based on creating an atmosphere so based on your thoughts that's reason i just want i just want to be positive i just want to say what he said because you know what if we don't confess what he said about us then you know what we make him a liar if you say something different than what he said he said by his stripes i'm healed well if i confess anything separate than that then i'm saying he's a liar if if i have a need and i don't and i claim well i don't know how i'm going to get out of this just everything looks so bad no if i'm not confessing what he said i make him a liar so i'm just so glad that i have a place a source that i can go to he spoke it he'll make it good you know one of my favorite quotes brother man i'm ever made and i've read it here and i read it anytime i go preach someplace people ask me say what you believe i read i read the same quote i read brother ram said in the message why 1963 talking about that lady she's so poor turning for help had nobody to help her poor and broke need to turn to charity for something didn't have anything but she had a son and you know and they were sort of investigating her case and trying to find out what happened you know why she had such bad shape said don't your son don't you ever hear from your son oh yeah i get sweet letters from him wonderful letters from me and so they're real pretty pictures and they said well let's look at those pretty pictures and so she went to her bible and she opened them up and she pulled out those pretty pictures and they and she handed them to them and somebody looked at them and said you know what they were they were bank drafts her son was in india and he had converted the indian money to american money and sent her bank drafts and brother branham said in the lids of her bible laid what she had need of and he said she just thought she had pretty pictures and he said brother when when somebody tries to tell you tries to make a painted fire of pentecost that jesus says jesus christ isn't the same yesterday today and forever he said don't you believe that he said peter said when he when he spoke on the day of pentecost he said it's unto you and to your children and to them that's far off even as many as the lord our god shall call that's the reason people ask me what do you believe that's what i believe i believe hebrews 13 8 i believe he's the same he was yesterday he's the same today he'll be there he'll be the same tomorrow if he ever made a promise to anybody if it's if it's in this if it's in this bible if he made a promise to anybody and any he said you have the same faith meet the same condition somebody else made he's obligated to you to do the same thing and you know i've never in my life met god on those conditions that he's failed me because he said david said david said i'm i'm old and i was young he said i've never seen the righteous forsaken or seed begging bread right that's right i mean we're so blessed i'm so thankful i tell you what i just i i can't say enough about him i can't i can't talk about him enough i can't praise him enough i can't think about it man and i appreciate him for all that he's done for me amen before we go this evening i just want to make sure everybody all hearts and minds are clear appreciate you tonight for all that you for you pulling on the word and all that all your blessings on me and our family and i appreciate each one of you love you appreciate a wonderful pastor all that all he does for us he has to put up with us so that's a big job so before we go
