[5:00] amen amen Genesis chapter 1: 1 says in
[5:04] the beginning God created the heavens
[5:06] and the Earth and the Earth was without
[5:08] form and void and darkness was upon the
[5:12] face of the deep and the spirit of God
[5:13] moved upon the face of the waters and
[5:17] God said let there be light and there
[5:18] was light and God saw the light that it
[5:22] was good and God divided the light from
[5:25] the darkness and God called the light
[5:28] day and the Darkness he called night and
[5:31] the evening and the morning was were the
[5:34] first day amen God bless you may be
[5:37] seated and
[5:40] uh I want to look at this tonight you
[5:44] know um here in the in the scripture you
[5:47] know brother Brandon was talking
[5:50] about God when he created creating the
[5:53] heavens and the Earth and it's in
[5:55] darkness and there and it's without form
[5:58] and void and and all this and we don't
[6:00] know how long it was that he created the
[6:02] heavens and earth we just know that he
[6:03] created it
[6:05] amen but there came a time when the
[6:07] spirit of God moved
[6:09] upon the the Earth and he began to move
[6:12] and brother R said you know he brooded
[6:14] over the Earth and he began to move and
[6:16] he began to do because he had a had a
[6:20] plan a purpose on what he was doing and
[6:22] he moved upon the upon
[6:24] the the Earth and you know and then he
[6:27] said let there be light and you and so
[6:30] you know we know how this story it came
[6:32] into existence and God began to speak
[6:34] and bring th bring things into existence
[6:37] in the earth and BR bring it into the
[6:39] place that he wanted all of it to be and
[6:42] you know a individual our Our Lives
[6:45] typed this this scene right here because
[6:48] we came in darkness without form and
[6:50] void and we didn't have the spirit of
[6:53] God with us and we dealt in darkness but
[6:56] we but there came a time when God came
[7:00] and he brought this light and he spoke
[7:02] this light and it came into existence
[7:05] now you know sometimes when we look at
[7:07] when we look at this scene we
[7:09] think in our in our minds you know we we
[7:12] see this great light that come into
[7:14] existence which it was a great light but
[7:16] you know it wasn't a great light so much
[7:20] in what we see because God didn't blind
[7:23] us with light he just brings light a
[7:27] little bit out of it at time right
[7:30] and you know we see this light come in
[7:32] and you know because you know in John
[7:34] chapter one there he was speaking of the
[7:37] the in the beginning was the word and he
[7:39] said and he in him was life and the life
[7:42] was the light of men and you know he
[7:44] came into existence but he said he said
[7:46] but they did not he said the light
[7:48] shineth in darkness and the Darkness
[7:50] comprehended it not because when the
[7:52] light Shone forth into the darkness they
[7:55] didn't comprehend what what they were
[7:57] seeing and there came but you know there
[7:59] was a group of people that did catch
[8:01] that light but it came gradually you
[8:05] know there was a there was a just that
[8:06] spark that came and you know that's the
[8:08] reason I was talking about as a as a
[8:10] flash because you know it's just a
[8:13] momentary light or just just a portion
[8:15] of light that came into existence that
[8:17] everybody could see because it was just
[8:19] that part to for you to see and you know
[8:22] when when you go back and look and if
[8:24] you look at your life and you see that
[8:26] you know you're you're in this darkness
[8:28] and and everything is so dark and you
[8:30] you know as brother R was talking about
[8:31] you couldn't see your hand before your
[8:32] face and you he said the darkness was so
[8:35] so large and so heavy that you know you
[8:38] felt the darkness and you're in this and
[8:41] and you're in this place but he said
[8:42] just the smallest amount of light he
[8:45] said it chases the darkness away he said
[8:48] it just takes just that momentary light
[8:51] and that's all it took was that
[8:52] momentary just that spark just a small
[8:55] light and you know in our lives we were
[8:58] we we were living in darkness and and
[9:00] and you know all the things that we we
[9:02] we thought we had life and we thought
[9:03] everything was good but you know
[9:05] somewhere down on the inside of us when
[9:07] we took a real measure of Our Lives you
[9:09] know what we were in darkness we were we
[9:12] were so in ingrained in this Darkness
[9:15] you know there was no way of escaping
[9:17] this but you know God came and brought
[9:18] light into our into our in our our midst
[9:22] and you know if we all were are
[9:25] all honest with ourselves how many times
[9:29] did the light of God come into our lives
[9:31] and we turned it down how many times did
[9:34] he come and try to deal with us and we
[9:36] we rejected him and you know he came and
[9:39] he and he stirred our Waters and we just
[9:41] couldn't yield ourselves to the Holy
[9:45] Spirit and you know it was just like
[9:47] being in a storm you know you're in this
[9:49] darkness and you see this storm coming
[9:51] and all of a sudden you see these
[9:52] flashes of lightning and all of a sudden
[9:55] everything begins to light up and you
[9:57] see these things taking place and you
[9:59] know don't respond to that you know and
[10:03] and this this is where
[10:05] uh brother brand brother random say one
[10:08] time he was talking about the lightning
[10:10] and he said you know the light shines in
[10:11] the darkness he said it proves no matter
[10:13] how dark it is there still can be light
[10:17] amen and so no matter how much Darkness
[10:20] there is there's always going to be
[10:21] light am and no matter where you're at
[10:24] there's always going to be light
[10:27] shining and and and the message message
[10:30] this is where I kind of got my
[10:31] inspiration from I was reading the the
[10:34] message the UNC oncoming storm
[10:39] 1960 and you know brother BR tells the
[10:41] story about the young man that came to
[10:42] him in the meeting and he come he
[10:45] couldn't wait till the end of the Ser
[10:47] service to come and he wanted to find
[10:50] God and you know brother BR was having a
[10:52] healing service and he said sure son he
[10:53] said I'll lead you to Christ but he said
[10:56] he said I got to know God for myself
[10:59] and you know he came and he came to
[11:01] brother brandom he said Parson he Saidi
[11:03] want to tell you my story and and you
[11:05] know he was talking about being up there
[11:06] in that pulpwood camp and you know he
[11:09] was up there in that storm and you know
[11:11] he was out there and you know he kind of
[11:13] run from his family he said the rest of
[11:14] my family's Christian but he said I
[11:17] wasn't a Christian he said I just kind
[11:18] of lived my own life and he said you
[11:20] know I broke and I ended up in this
[11:22] pulpwood camp and they were going to
[11:24] give me a job and he said he said well I
[11:27] can cook do you do you need a cook and
[11:29] he's like know but we got this elderly
[11:30] black lady in here that cooks for us
[11:32] said maybe you can help her so he went
[11:33] in there they paid him some money to
[11:34] help her and you know that one night he
[11:37] said I was laying there and he said all
[11:38] of a sudden he said there was flashes of
[11:41] light that caught my attention and he
[11:43] said I couldn't figure out what was
[11:44] going on but he said those flashes of
[11:45] light caught my attention and he said
[11:47] then I heard voices speaking and he said
[11:49] I couldn't figure out what was going on
[11:51] he said so I woke up and he said I
[11:52] realized it was the boss and the
[11:54] teamster and they were talking about the
[11:56] horses and he said that the condition
[11:58] that they were in that northerner he
[12:00] said because he said if we don't do
[12:02] something right now he said we may not
[12:04] be here much longer because that storm
[12:07] was so bad that he said nothing would be
[12:09] left and he was laying there and he was
[12:12] thinking he said I got so
[12:14] scared and he said he said I was I was
[12:16] laying there thinking about this he said
[12:18] that elderly lady was in the other tent
[12:20] the other part over there and he he she
[12:23] began to call to him he said son come
[12:25] here and you know she began to speak to
[12:28] him and she asked him said are you a

[13:13] was sitting there and he said she was
[13:15] calm as she could be she had anchored
[13:19] into something that she didn't she
[13:20] wasn't worried about what was going to
[13:22] take place but he was standing there and
[13:24] he was so worried and he said he said
[13:25] when he got away from there he he got to
[13:28] this meeting where brother Brown was and
[13:29] he had to tell brother brand he said I
[13:31] want to find Christ and you know he
[13:33] brother brand began to speak to him and
[13:34] you know he was so relieved and he got
[13:37] down on his knees and he's like listen

[13:44] God brings that light into your into
[13:46] your life and it begins to see you and
[13:47] you begin to follow that light when you
[13:50] begin to go after that light and desire
[13:53] what God is calling you and you you have
[13:55] a response to that then then God will
[13:57] meet you there and then you know he
[14:00] because he that he said because that
[14:02] young man found what he was looking for
[14:04] that day and he said God gave him a
[14:06] chance he said but you may not have
[14:08] another opportunity this may be your
[14:10] last opportunity you don't know when
[14:12] you're going to pass away or what's
[14:14] going to change in your situation but
[14:15] you know he give her he gave this young
[14:18] man the opportunity to receive what he
[14:20] was looking for and God called him out
[14:22] the goodness of God called him to
[14:24] repentance and he answered that call and
[14:27] you know and that's the way we are we
[14:28] have to answer the call of God that we
[14:30] need to go after what God has called us
[14:33] to do God is is calling us to go after
[14:36] these things and you know if if you're
[14:38] if you're not saved and tonight's the
[14:40] night that you need to get right with
[14:41] God but you know it's the same thing is
[14:43] whatever you have need of or wherever
[14:45] you are whatever condition you're in
[14:47] tonight tonight's the night because
[14:50] today is the day of salvation today is
[14:52] the day that we've got to get ready
[14:54] because we don't know how much longer
[14:55] we're going to be and tonight is the
[14:58] night that if if if if you have anything
[15:00] that that you want to get rid of
[15:02] tonight's the night to get rid of it if
[15:04] you're looking for an answer tonight
[15:06] then God is here to give you your answer
[15:08] tonight whatever it is because I I you
[15:11] know I realized because one of the
[15:13] things I was looking at T is I realize
[15:15] this is probably my the last sermon I'm
[15:16] going to preach this year here and this
[15:19] and this is just something that's on my
[15:21] heart to share because listen I don't
[15:23] want to carry over things I don't want
[15:26] to carry over things into a new year and
[15:29] I I know it's not about making
[15:30] resolutions or doing all these kind of
[15:32] things but you know now we come to the
[15:34] end of the year we we start to look back
[15:36] at our lives we begin to look back over
[15:37] the year and all the things that God has
[15:40] done for us and where he's brought us to
[15:42] and we be and we take a inventory of of
[15:45] of our lives and where we stand today
[15:47] and is realizing you know I'm not what I
[15:49] used to be but I'm not what I want to be
[15:53] and I'm not want to all to be but you
[15:55] know what tonight I realize that I have
[15:58] the opportunity
[15:59] to be what I want to be I have the
[16:02] opportunity to be molded into Jesus
[16:04] Christ and to lay down all of the all of
[16:06] the sin and everything all the weights
[16:09] that so easily beset us and run the race
[16:11] that's set before us I have the
[16:14] opportunity to do that
[16:16] tonight and you and I we have that
[16:18] opportunity tonight
[16:23] am so I you know I want I want to lay
[16:28] these things
[16:29] out I just want to pour out my heart
[16:31] tonight because you you you have to go
[16:33] after these things you have to realize
[16:35] that what God has called you too and
[16:37] what God has given you you've got to
[16:39] understand it belongs to you it's it's
[16:41] God's it's God's word to you you've got
[16:43] to take it and go with it it's not for
[16:47] anybody
[16:49] else you
[16:51] know you you think about you think about
[16:56] Mary you know here here She is
[16:59] is this young virgin girl teenage girl
[17:04] being a spouse to an older man Joseph
[17:06] and you know here she is and and she's
[17:08] reading the scripture reading the
[17:10] Scrolls hearing the the priests talk
[17:12] about Isaiah's prophecy of what was
[17:15] going to take place here all this time
[17:17] she's she believes it she hears it she
[17:20] knows it's the truth but you know here
[17:22] she is beginning to speak that even you
[17:24] even having times where she's sitting
[17:26] there and her and Joseph are talking
[17:27] about what's going to take place because
[17:30] you know what this is this is the
[17:32] Messiah they're looking they're looking
[17:34] for God to be made flesh that the word
[17:36] is going to be
[17:38] fulfilled and what a glorious day that
[17:40] we're we're looking for and you know as
[17:43] she begins to see all these things and
[17:45] you know she begins to ponder these
[17:47] things and what is going to take place
[17:48] and how wonderful it's going to be when
[17:50] we see these things and but you know
[17:53] what God began to deal with her
[17:55] realizing she was the one it wasn't some
[17:58] somebody else that was going to do that
[18:01] and you know she began to deal and you
[18:03] know when you think about and you and
[18:05] you meditate on the word and you think
[18:06] about these things see that God begins
[18:08] to deal with you when you when you're
[18:11] meditating on the word and he begins to
[18:13] come to speak to you because you know
[18:15] when when you bring him into your
[18:17] presence and you you come into His
[18:19] presence and you know you're you're
[18:20] welcoming him and and you want to
[18:22] meditate on him and you want to thank
[18:24] him and you want to pray and you want to
[18:26] praise him then you know he comes to to
[18:29] you and he begins to begins to speak to
[18:32] you and have fellowship with you and
[18:34] know here she here's Mary they praying
[18:37] and thinking on these things and
[18:38] thinking about what a wonderful thing is
[18:40] because you know it could be just any
[18:42] day that the Fulfillment of God's word
[18:45] is going to take place and we're going
[18:46] to have the Messiah God made flesh in
[18:48] our midst but you know in in the midst
[18:51] of all of that that she was facing and
[18:53] talking about it and having this
[18:54] Fellowship there was a flash of light
[18:56] brother R said that came and all of a
[18:58] sudden gab Gabriel is standing in her
[19:00] midst and beginning to speak to
[19:04] her and he says hell Mary and and and so
[19:08] brother BR says that means for her you

[19:20] somebody else this message is for
[19:23] you here it is it's for you and then
[19:26] he's beginning to speak to to her
[19:30] because she believes this is going to
[19:31] take place this is true and he said
[19:34] blessed art thou among
[19:36] women see you're going to be the one
[19:39] that's going to bring forth a

[19:47] other virgin that's going to do it guess
[19:49] what God has chosen you to do this this
[19:52] is
[19:53] yours and then all of a sudden you know
[19:56] no no no doubt as brother R said you
[19:58] know she was
[19:59] frightened you know you know you got
[20:03] confidence and you got faith all until

[20:08] this and then it's like well how am I
[20:10] going to do
[20:12] this how how am I going
[20:15] to how just just this young
[20:18] insignificant
[20:20] teenager how am I going to do
[20:24] this he's like listen it's it's not what
[20:28] you're going to
[20:29] do he said but the holy spirit's going
[20:31] to overshadow you and you're going to
[20:34] bring forth a
[20:36] child you're going to do
[20:38] this well you know she didn't understand
[20:41] everything but you know what she un she
[20:43] believed what Gabriel told her what the
[20:45] angel had told her and then she said be
[20:47] it unto me according to Thy word you
[20:50] know she she believed what was said to
[20:52] her and she took it and realized you
[20:55] know it it would it would taken some
[20:58] time for her to come to the place to
[21:00] realize that she was
[21:02] pregnant but you know what she didn't
[21:04] lose her faith she walked in the faith
[21:07] of that and began to testify and you
[21:09] know then when it tells her you know
[21:11] when the Gabriel is telling her about
[21:13] Elizabeth having having a child in her
[21:15] old age and you know she's six months
[21:18] and you know then all of a sudden Mary
[21:20] is so elated that she's going to go tell
[21:23] Elizabeth what has
[21:25] happened and she and she's Overjoyed
[21:28] what's hey listen I got I got to spread
[21:29] this and tell
[21:31] somebody the god the god of Miracles is
[21:34] com in our
[21:36] midst but you know sometimes sometimes
[21:39] because when God do does these things in
[21:41] our midst sometimes we we can get to the
[21:44] place where it's just
[21:48] like you know it's like we there there's
[21:50] there's no where there's no excitement
[21:52] there's no thrill there's no Zeal there
[21:54] but you know it's like when she when she
[21:56] got this message why because it was
[21:58] something that she had been waiting on
[22:00] it's something that she knew was going
[22:01] to take place and all of a sudden when
[22:04] it came it came to her it was her word
[22:08] it was she was the one that was told
[22:10] that was going to do this and then she
[22:12] got up and she was she was so elated she
[22:14] had to go find Elizabeth to tell her
[22:17] listen the angel has come and spoke to
[22:19] me and told me I'm going to bring forth
[22:22] the Son of God well here's here's the
[22:24] Messiah it's the Fulfillment of the word
[22:26] and here here I realize that according
[22:28] what Gabriel said look you're expecting
[22:31] a child after all these years of
[22:33] struggle and heartache all of a sudden
[22:35] now you're reach God has blessed you
[22:38] amen and here it is and then you know
[22:41] but you know Elizabeth hadn't had seen
[22:44] him move or any nothing had taken place
[22:46] but I just at the mention of the name
[22:48] Jesus you know she said the baby jumped
[22:51] in my
[22:52] womb and here it is something that's
[22:54] taking place see it was it was a
[22:56] reaction and you know each one of them
[22:58] having their own but you know what the
[23:00] world didn't know that the world didn't
[23:03] respond to that that's right you know
[23:06] even even Joseph and and you know
[23:08] Zacharias you know here he is the angel
[23:10] coming to him and speaking to him here's
[23:12] a great learned man and and knows the
[23:15] knows the scripture and knows the law
[23:16] and everything and here comes an angel
[23:18] and has he has a supernatural experience
[23:21] and you know what all he can do is doubt
[23:23] and dispute with the
[23:26] angel here is God trying to deal with
[23:29] him and trying to tell him what's going
[23:30] to take place and how can these things
[23:32] be what's your
[23:37] credentials and he told himself listen
[23:39] your mouth caused you a lot of trouble
[23:41] so guess what we're just
[23:43] going till the baby's born you can't say
[23:45] nothing and it'll save you a lot of
[23:49] trouble there's been times in my life if
[23:52] the Lord had done that to me that had
[23:54] saved me a little trouble too
[23:57] amen but here's Joseph here's Mary
[24:00] telling them this Supernatural thing
[24:02] that happened the angel had come and
[24:04] spoke to her and told her all these
[24:07] things well you know what Joseph didn't
[24:09] understand it but you know what he
[24:10] didn't he didn't dispute it but what did
[24:13] he do he was praying about it he was
[24:15] seeking God like how is this
[24:18] possible but God came to speak to him in
[24:20] a dream and told him not to worry about
[24:24] taking Mary as your
[24:26] wife this is a supernatural
[24:29] experience see he each had each one of
[24:31] them had to have their own
[24:34] experience and it's whether it's and it
[24:36] was up to them whether they believed it
[24:38] or not but each one of them had to have
[24:41] their own
[24:43] experience and you know here's Mary
[24:45] walking all all these years you know
[24:47] continuing on and you know having having
[24:50] a bad name and how everybody just
[24:52] rejected her and and all those type
[24:54] things and everybody ridiculed her and
[24:56] everything but you know it didn't it
[24:57] didn't
[24:58] diminish her testimony it didn't
[25:01] diminish what was on the inside of her
[25:04] what what stirred inside of her it still
[25:06] kept burning
[25:08] amen see she just kept on going and kept
[25:13] walking and you know even even when she
[25:15] went through all all the things that
[25:17] went that she went through but you know
[25:18] what she know what was the Fulfillment
[25:20] of that amen but it wasn't it wasn't a
[25:23] it wasn't for everybody it wasn't a
[25:25] public show not everybody got to see
[25:27] that but it was something that was real
[25:30] to her it was something personal to
[25:33] her and here she is carrying this child
[25:35] all the way through amen now I I I don't
[25:39] know I don't I don't think she did but
[25:41] you know I mean you know when you begin
[25:43] to read these scriptures because
[25:45] sometimes the scriptures that are in the
[25:46] in the New Testament when they talk
[25:48] about the birth of Jesus and everything
[25:50] you know sometimes in the old test the
[25:52] the priest and all this they didn't
[25:55] understand those
[25:56] things because when go back in the
[25:59] scripture and the Fulfillment of it
[26:01] takes place in the gospels they say that
[26:03] this might be the Fulfillment of what
[26:05] Jeremy Jeremiah said it goes back to the
[26:08] scripture and points back to what what
[26:10] the Old Testament was saying showing
[26:12] that was the Fulfillment of the Old
[26:14] Testament they didn't see those
[26:16] things so did did she understand what
[26:20] was going to take place in the future
[26:21] probably
[26:22] not but she walked in what she knew and
[26:25] what she believed and she kept going and
[26:27] it's like well you know all of a sudden
[26:28] we've got to go pay taxes in
[26:31] Bethlehem what did she did she think
[26:34] ahead of time oh this is this is going
[26:35] to be the Fulfillment of
[26:38] scripture no she's just looking ahead
[26:41] and thinking I'm this much pregnant and
[26:43] I've got to travel all those many
[26:46] miles I got to go all this
[26:49] way and I'm sure there was a lot of days
[26:52] she was just sitting around praying that
[26:54] the day would hurry up be over
[26:56] with cuz I want to leave lay down I
[26:59] don't want to travel
[27:00] anymore but not realizing that was the
[27:03] Fulfillment of
[27:05] scripture and here she is no doubt she's
[27:08] she's ready to give birth and all you
[27:11] know tired and achy and everything and
[27:14] all these problems and everything and
[27:16] not realizing she's walking in the
[27:17] Fulfillment of scripture
[27:19] amen and it's just like we we don't
[27:22] don't see that and all of a sudden you
[27:24] know here she is I can't find a place to
[27:26] to rent to stay in b Bethlehem and you
[27:28] know like well you know we're back in a
[27:32] thousand and not realizing that's but
[27:34] but it's fulfilling the scripture it's
[27:37] fulfilling the scriptural type and here
[27:39] she is you know they end up in in the
[27:41] manger in the in the stable you know and
[27:43] you know here they are going through all
[27:45] these things not realizing it's a ful
[27:47] fulfillment of
[27:49] scripture and all of a sudden you know
[27:51] she's going through all of this and
[27:53] labor and you know all all the hardships
[27:55] that she went through and here she is
[27:58] ends up in this place and all of a
[28:01] sudden according to the scripture when
[28:03] when all this took place you know here
[28:05] there are the shepherd show up because
[28:07] they come because the Angels had told
[28:09] them listen the savior's born tonight
[28:12] well you know they they show up because
[28:13] you know what hey they're they're
[28:15] excited right amen well sometimes what
[28:18] happens is you know it was something
[28:20] that was something that took place to
[28:21] Mary but all of a sudden then you
[28:23] realize you know what this this was some
[28:25] God's working on both ends not just on
[28:28] one end this is not because you know
[28:30] this is not just something that's done
[28:32] in in a back room or you know hidden
[28:34] from everything but God began to show
[28:36] her that this was true and it began to
[28:39] bring those people in and and and you
[28:41] know you look at all the things that she
[28:43] had went through all the ridicule and
[28:44] everything but here these men the Magi
[28:48] God swed a s sign in the sky and they
[28:51] followed it for
[28:54] years and here here She is you know
[28:57] going about her daily
[28:58] life they're going through their daily
[29:00] life going through the things that
[29:01] they've been through you know just just
[29:03] living an ordinary life just paying the
[29:05] bills going through living and all of a
[29:08] sudden here these men show
[29:11] up and it's supernatural thing happening
[29:14] and here these men are asking everybody
[29:17] where is he born King of the
[29:20] Jews it's like
[29:23] what what what are you talking about you
[29:26] know and herod's like
[29:28] there's a
[29:29] king you know is this is it where where
[29:32] where where's all this supposed to take
[29:34] place you know he's want to know what's
[29:36] going on and where where are we supposed
[29:37] to find these
[29:39] things but you here they are they come
[29:41] all this way bringing these gifts to to
[29:46] Mary and Joseph and looking for this
[29:48] child that's the Fulfillment of
[29:50] scripture this is the one that we've all
[29:52] been waiting
[29:53] on and sometimes sometimes we get we
[29:56] people get and even we do do that
[29:58] sometimes we get to the place where it
[29:59] just becomes common and you know we just
[30:01] kind it just kind of washes away and you
[30:03] know and then all of a sudden we get
[30:04] this thing that takes place and it snaps
[30:07] us back to the place and realize hey
[30:09] look where you're standing look what
[30:11] you're doing look what look what God has
[30:13] done for you then all of a sudden you're
[30:15] standing in the midst and realize you
[30:17] know what this is not just some little
[30:18] boy but this is the Fulfillment of
[30:21] scripture and you know what and not only
[30:23] were you looking for this and seeking
[30:25] this but you know what there was other
[30:26] people looking for the exact same thing
[30:28] and they came to the place and here they
[30:29] are bringing their gifts unto this child
[30:33] bringing the gold frankincense and Mer
[30:35] showing that what he was supposed to do
[30:37] he was deity dedicated to death what he
[30:40] was going to do he was fulfilling the
[30:43] scripture here he is in the in the midst
[30:45] of all
[30:47] this and all the things that went on and
[30:49] sometimes you know we don't see we don't
[30:51] see the the picture of the plan of God
[30:54] all we see is just the things that
[30:55] happen around us we don't see those
[30:57] things
[30:58] right brother amen but here she was she
[31:00] came along and it really just moved and
[31:03] all of a sudden the supernatural began
[31:05] to
[31:10] happen and see it's the same way see we
[31:13] see these things how it just begin to
[31:15] take place in in their lives and here
[31:17] they are all all these things that were
[31:19] taking place that was
[31:21] happening you know no doubt he was just
[31:25] you know Jesus was just a just a little
[31:27] boy that just GRE grew up like everybody
[31:29] else and you know he had to go through
[31:30] the same things that everybody else had
[31:32] to go through and you know I mean you
[31:34] know he had to learn how to walk and
[31:35] talk and everything else you know I mean
[31:38] but you know I mean he came but God
[31:40] began to deal with him from a young age
[31:42] and you know when they went to the when
[31:43] they went to the Passover and they were
[31:45] there in the in the temple you know he
[31:47] was he was talking to the doctors and
[31:48] questioning them about the law and
[31:50] everything like that they you know they
[31:52] were up and gone and he was he was in he
[31:54] said well I must be about my father's
[31:56] business
[31:58] why cuz he knew who he was but you know
[32:01] he began to grow in Grace and knowledge
[32:03] and and all these things but you know
[32:04] there was something that was taking
[32:05] place and here it is you know sometimes
[32:07] you know we're just worried about the
[32:09] laundry and and different things like
[32:10] that and all of a sudden God begins to
[32:12] speak to you and realize you know
[32:13] there's other things Beyond those things
[32:15] there's there's things that that are
[32:17] happening and sometimes we realize well
[32:18] it's just paying the bills and and
[32:20] taking the kids to school and doing this
[32:22] and all the other things and not
[32:24] realizing the supernatural happens in
[32:25] our midst and we miss it
[32:31] amen see many times you know God is
[32:34] there wanting to speak to us and you
[32:36] know we're too busy with too many other
[32:38] things that we miss God God wants to
[32:40] have fellowship with us and he wants to
[32:42] speak to your heart because he wants to
[32:44] reveal his word to you many times we
[32:45] don't have time for him because we got
[32:48] too many time we get too much stressed
[32:49] out of of too many things and not
[32:52] realizing that what God wants us to do
[32:54] is put all of our cares upon him cuz he
[32:57] cares for
[33:03] us and I have I have to remind myself of
[33:06] that sometimes
[33:08] because with my with my job you know I
[33:12] get I just get aggravated with people
[33:16] like I like I told you before you know
[33:18] you go in there and tell them
[33:20] listen this ain't this ain't the this
[33:22] ain't the way it used to be and this
[33:24] ain't this ain't the way it's supposed
[33:25] to be and you got to keep pointing them
[33:28] back to what the standard is
[33:31] amen hey we got we got a job to do and
[33:34] there's a standard and there's a way of
[33:36] doing it and either you either do it
[33:38] right or don't do it at
[33:41] all and it's the same way with the word
[33:43] of God there's a standard there's a
[33:45] there's a law there's a there's a
[33:47] process for everything and you this is
[33:49] what we got to follow it's not my idea
[33:51] it's not somebody else's idea it's not
[33:54] the pastor's idea it wasn't even brother
[33:56] bram's idea
[33:58] but it was God's word it was God's
[34:00] thought that came forth and you know
[34:02] what all we got to do is say Amen to it
[34:05] and we got to claim it and believe it
[34:09] amen see we take those things and you
[34:11] know you see the things as they they
[34:13] begin to
[34:14] move and here's Jesus preaching and you
[34:18] know growing up and and becoming into
[34:19] the into the ministry and begin to
[34:22] preach and you know he began to you know
[34:24] seek out to the disciples and and you
[34:27] know all those things that you know he
[34:28] began to minister to the people and he
[34:30] began to tell them what was going to
[34:32] take place and understanding the
[34:34] scripture what was taking place in the
[34:36] day and hour in which they live and you
[34:38] know it wasn't for everybody not
[34:40] everybody agreed with it not everybody
[34:42] believed it but you know what it was
[34:43] still the truth and it was the time and
[34:46] so because you know there was a group
[34:48] because you know as he said you know the
[34:51] ones that God has called me he's given
[34:53] me he said they're going to come to me
[34:55] right he said you know he said I as he
[34:58] told the disciples that day he said I've
[35:00] not you've not chosen me I've chosen
[35:03] you and he began to call to them amen
[35:08] and here the and here they are the
[35:09] disciples you know here they are just
[35:11] working their jobs and doing their doing
[35:13] their daily duties and going through
[35:15] everything going through the motions of
[35:16] life and and all that but you know when
[35:18] when God came to the came on the scene
[35:20] you know he began to speak to them and
[35:22] speak to their situations and begin to
[35:25] speak to them and you know brother Bram
[35:27] said here when when he began to speak to
[35:30] like Peter and and he was talking about
[35:32] Nathaniel when you know when when they
[35:34] you know he's like you know can any good
[35:35] thing come out of Nazareth and you know
[35:37] all these things but you know what God
[35:39] began to but when Jesus came into his
[35:41] midst he began to speak to him in his
[35:44] situation and he began to speak to
[35:47] him he said he said Rabbi when when when
[35:50] did you ever know me he said I saw you
[35:52] under the
[35:54] tree say I knew all about you
[35:58] and they began to speak to them and you
[36:01] know when it began to stir their waters
[36:04] you know when it began to when it began
[36:06] to move in the situation in which they
[36:07] lived you know as brother R was talking
[36:09] about Peter and and as and Andrew I
[36:12] believe was you know their their father
[36:13] began to talk to him all about the
[36:15] scripture and about the Messiah coming
[36:16] and all these type things it's like you
[36:18] know I I may not be able to see this
[36:20] fulfillment this may be in your day but
[36:22] never take your eyes off of this always
[36:25] keep looking to see the Messiah is
[36:28] coming and when he began to speak to
[36:30] these things then you know brother BR
[36:32] said you know when the when the word
[36:33] came in there and they began to see the
[36:36] Fulfillment even the thoughts of their
[36:38] their hearts Jesus began to speak to
[36:41] them and began to speak he said when the
[36:42] light flashed across their lives and
[36:45] they began to see those things he said
[36:47] you know what you didn't you didn't have
[36:48] to go back and and say anything else to
[36:52] them he said you know because he said
[36:54] they went they went right to the Altar
[36:56] and they got they got saved he said you
[36:59] didn't have you didn't have to try to
[37:01] pull and tug on them or anything like
[37:03] that because when something Supernatural
[37:05] came their way and touched them you know
[37:06] what you wer you weren't going to get
[37:08] them away from that it was something
[37:10] that supernaturally took place in their
[37:12] lives and you know they went after that
[37:15] they were sold on
[37:17] that even even even in all their faults
[37:20] and failures and and not understanding
[37:22] the scripture and all the things and
[37:24] didn't understand Jesus and his and his
[37:26] ministry and all kinds of things but you
[37:28] know there was Peter standing there and
[37:29] he said Lord to whom shall we
[37:32] go thou alone has the words of eternal
[37:35] life even when he seen everybody walking
[37:37] away and all the confusion and
[37:39] everything there was a lot of confusion
[37:40] in him that he didn't understand things
[37:43] but you know what he never got away from
[37:44] that there was something that anchored
[37:47] inside of him he couldn't get away from
[37:49] that and so you know he began to follow
[37:51] that and you know he was like Lord he
[37:53] said I don't know where you go or what
[37:54] you're going to have to face you know
[37:56] even when Jesus began to talk to he said
[37:58] but you know what I'll be right there
[37:59] with you to the end he said everybody
[38:01] else will forsake you he said but I'll
[38:04] be right there I'm not I'm not leaving
[38:07] you he's like listen
[38:09] Peter you know I love
[38:12] you but I'm G I'm GNA have to tell you
[38:14] something and you're not going to like
[38:18] it you're not going to follow
[38:21] me you know and it's like
[38:25] no yeah they listen P
[38:29] yeah before the Croc crows you're going
[38:32] to deny me three times just you know I
[38:35] mean he just trying to talk to Peter but
[38:36] you know Peter's so bullheaded you mean
[38:38] he's just so strong and
[38:41] no but you know what it was he saw the
[38:44] Fulfillment of God's word after Jesus
[38:46] told him what was going to take
[38:48] place
[38:50] am but you know what he didn't do away
[38:53] with them he didn't reject them
[38:57] you know what even even in the midst of
[38:59] all the things that they
[39:00] done you know when when they had all
[39:03] their their faults and failures and
[39:04] problems you know God didn't turn turn
[39:06] away from
[39:08] them you know there in the in the
[39:10] scripture you know when when the when
[39:12] the Scripture it tells there when when
[39:17] the uh the man brought his son that was
[39:21] possessed of the devil and you know he
[39:23] and the disciples came and tried to cast
[39:25] him out and he said he said they and
[39:26] then the man brought him to Jesus and
[39:28] he's like hey Lord he said your
[39:30] disciples tried to cast out and you they
[39:33] couldn't but you know what he gave them
[39:35] he gave them the promise to cast out
[39:38] devils and you know he promised them and
[39:41] said that was the that was the word of
[39:42] God to them spoke to them listen y'all
[39:44] cast out Devils well you know what they
[39:46] did but he said see you know this this
[39:49] comes by prayer and supplication said
[39:52] this is more you couldn't do this but
[39:54] you know what it didn't do it like he
[39:56] didn't like brother said he didn't do
[39:57] away with the promise the promise was
[39:59] still there when they failed he didn't
[40:01] do away with it they still had that
[40:04] promise you still have the
[40:06] promise like brother Bram said he said
[40:09] God's power is given to you he said but
[40:11] it's limited by your faith
[40:14] right he said many times the problem is
[40:16] is he said he said we don't act on it he
[40:19] said because the power and the the word
[40:21] is given to us he said but we don't
[40:23] because sometimes we're afraid to act on
[40:25] it we're AF afraid to move up and do
[40:28] what God has given us the promise to do
[40:32] right but you know when when the
[40:34] disciples failed Jesus didn't
[40:38] say you know what he told him listen but
[40:41] he give them away listen this is what
[40:42] y'all got to do you got to
[40:45] grow it's it's growing amen it's a
[40:49] there's a there's a spiritual growth
[40:51] that's got to take place you know he
[40:52] didn't do away with them but he kept
[40:54] trying to grow and listen listen y'all
[40:55] coming to this place
[40:59] and all all the way through you know he
[41:00] began to talk to them about these things
[41:02] and you know they didn't understand all
[41:05] the things that he done you know just
[41:07] like you know he went by the had to go
[41:10] by the well one day and you know he was
[41:13] going to go by this you know maybe they
[41:17] didn't know what was going on but Jesus
[41:21] did there was there was a lady that had
[41:23] a hunger in her
[41:25] heart and you know what and nobody else
[41:27] really cared about her she was
[41:32] Outcast you
[41:34] know sometimes people didn't even want
[41:36] to look in her
[41:40] direction we we don't we don't want you
[41:43] we don't want to be seen with you we
[41:45] don't want to be associated with you we
[41:47] don't need you
[41:49] around but you know what she's exactly
[41:52] the one that would receive the
[41:55] word she is the
[41:58] one because brother R was talking about
[42:00] he said you know the Pharisees and all
[42:02] you know they heard all the scripture
[42:04] you they heard him speak and they seen
[42:05] the Miracles and everything like that
[42:07] and it's
[42:08] like he has a spirit he has an evil
[42:11] spirit he's bails you above y'all need
[42:14] to stay away from
[42:16] him you know there there there's no that
[42:18] you can't have anything to do with
[42:20] him and it's like but you know here he
[42:22] is doing all the things and he said look
[42:25] in the scripture am I not doing the full
[42:27] filling the scripture am I search the
[42:30] scriptures is this not what the
[42:31] scripture said would take
[42:33] place but here's this young this lady
[42:36] that that's had a hard life she went
[42:37] through all these things and here she is
[42:39] and and nobody gives her any account or
[42:42] anything in her
[42:44] life but you know she's out by the
[42:48] whale and Jesus is there waiting on her
[42:51] and it's like uh can I get a drink
[42:55] water well you know she's taken back by
[42:57] this you know here she is and then she
[43:00] begins to speak to him and he begins to
[43:02] speak to her and he begins to speak to
[43:04] her of the scripture and he realizes
[43:07] that she she believes the scripture
[43:08] which he already knew that but when she
[43:10] begins to speak of the scripture taking
[43:12] place of what was going to take place
[43:14] and he begins to converse with her on
[43:16] the scripture because she's looking for
[43:18] the Messiah
[43:20] also now nobody else gives her any
[43:23] credit for this but she's looking for it
[43:25] whether nobody else believes it or not
[43:27] she's got her own testimony and she
[43:29] tells Jesus her
[43:31] testimony and then all of a sudden he
[43:33] begins to speak to her and she says sir
[43:35] I perceive you're a
[43:38] prophet and he said because when the
[43:40] light flashed in front of her when the
[43:42] when the word came open her that she
[43:44] called and he began to speak to her and
[43:46] he began to speak to her situation of
[43:49] where she was living and everything and
[43:50] he began to meet her needs and then all
[43:53] of a sudden then she rose up when she
[43:55] was like well
[43:57] might I might share that with my
[44:02] neighbor you know I might I might share
[44:05] with the family when we're sitting
[44:07] around the dinner
[44:09] table I might um you know I might share
[44:12] it with a cooworker in
[44:14] passing no as soon as she got what she
[44:16] wanted when something took place in her
[44:19] and she had this Supernatural experience
[44:21] take place when she got a revelation of
[44:22] what was going on she dropped everything
[44:25] and she took off running
[44:27] right amen and you know she was sharing
[44:29] with
[44:30] everybody come see a man who told me
[44:34] everything about my life is this not the
[44:38] Messiah he you know she's sharing she's
[44:40] sharing with everybody whether anybody
[44:42] thought she was crazy or not she's
[44:44] letting everybody know why because it
[44:46] was something that was real to her
[44:48] something that stirred her Waters and it
[44:49] had moved in her life and she's going to
[44:51] let everybody
[44:55] know see see it's the same way see when
[44:58] when something takes place does it has
[45:00] it stirred you to the place where you're
[45:02] where you're bubbling and
[45:06] overflowing has it has it moved you to
[45:08] that
[45:13] place see because many times it's just
[45:16] like well you know we just we just go
[45:18] through the motions or whatever but
[45:21] no maybe that's what we need maybe
[45:24] that's what we need now is is to have
[45:26] our for God to stir us to the
[45:31] place you
[45:37] know we've got
[45:41] these some of y'all know what water
[45:42] softener tanks
[45:44] are it's got a BN the ones we have a lot
[45:47] of them have sand in them the ones we've
[45:48] got has got got a special resin it's
[45:51] like almost like sand that's in there
[45:53] and it's got all this rock in the bottom
[45:54] of just like pebbles it's all piled up
[45:57] and we're cleaning we've been trying to
[45:58] clean one out cuz we got to get it moved
[45:59] and put some new equipment in and
[46:01] everything so we've been working on
[46:02] trying to get this thing emptied well we
[46:04] just siphon the first thing you do is
[46:06] just fill it full of water put a hose in
[46:08] there start siphoning that thing up but
[46:10] you know after a while that thing gets
[46:12] so hard you can't do nothing with it it
[46:15] settles in the bottom it's been in there
[46:17] for
[46:18] years and you know what you're in there
[46:21] and it's got It's got a weeping system
[46:22] in the bottom of it so kind of like got
[46:24] all these it almost looks like kind of
[46:27] reminds you of like Roots it's got all
[46:29] these holes that sucks the water in well
[46:31] when you're trying to get that thing out
[46:34] it don't move I mean it's like you
[46:36] almost need a jackhammer in there trying
[46:38] to bust that stuff up but you know the
[46:40] first thing we do we go get a air hose
[46:43] and we get a tube we stick an air hose
[46:45] way down in the bottom of it and you
[46:47] know what we start doing we start
[46:48] stirring it up amen we got to get in
[46:50] there because you know that stuff just
[46:52] sits in there and it's set in there for
[46:53] so long it's so it's so settled it gets
[46:56] so packed in there and you know what you
[46:57] got to put something in there to get
[46:59] that thing stirred up cuz if you don't
[47:00] ever Stir It Up it ain't it'll never
[47:03] change there there's never there's never
[47:05] going to be a change take place and so
[47:07] you know that's what we we we spend
[47:09] hours just and you know it's so funny
[47:11] because you're down there and you're
[47:12] suctioning you're pouring water in
[47:14] you're suctioning it out and you're
[47:16] pushing that all that air blowing it up
[47:17] and it's just stirring all that stuff up
[47:19] and everybody's over there and they run
[47:21] over to the water and they start looking
[47:22] like we getting anything out oh yeah
[47:24] we're getting Pebbles getting stuff out
[47:27] but you know ever so often when you get
[47:28] in there you just you just keep going at
[47:30] it keep going at it but all of a sudden
[47:31] you'll hit the like the motherload and
[47:33] all of a sudden this stuff comes blowing
[47:35] out you just see all this water just
[47:36] come all this stuff coming out in the
[47:38] water and it's like man that's it right
[47:40] there now look we were actually moving
[47:42] something and so so sometimes that's
[47:44] what God wants to do with us why because
[47:46] we've set and we got settled for so long
[47:48] and sometimes we've got so seditary with
[47:50] in our waves that when God wants to move
[47:52] you know what it's like well brother Bob
[47:54] you go ahead brother I'll be right there
[47:58] no God's want you to stir your Waters
[48:00] and see if you're going to react to it
[48:02] not wait for somebody
[48:05] else it's like well you know if somebody
[48:07] else will run the aisles maybe I'll get
[48:09] behind
[48:10] them well you know what if you get if
[48:12] you get excited I think you ought
[48:15] to and you know everybody's like well
[48:17] you know what somebody's gonna say
[48:19] something well you know and everybody
[48:21] says well you know don't jump any higher
[48:23] than you can live well I I I I I just I
[48:26] just tell you
[48:28] you how how I say you know the the the
[48:30] problem because you know what
[48:32] everybody's like well you know you're
[48:33] all going to have faults you're all
[48:35] going to have problems you're all going
[48:37] to you're all going to make a mistake
[48:38] it's like oh we're waiting they ran the
[48:42] aisles oh look there got to write all
[48:43] this stuff down I can't believe you run
[48:45] the aisles and
[48:46] you that's
[48:48] right well you know you can't Point your
[48:50] finger at anybody else cuz you got the
[48:52] same kind of
[48:54] issues and it's the and the problem is
[48:56] says you know what because you know what
[48:58] if if if somebody Falls and and they
[49:00] have a issue or problems or whatever
[49:02] guess what the grace of God covers all
[49:03] of
[49:04] that and you know what if you go back
[49:06] and you look to see where you came from
[49:08] and to where you are today and you can't
[49:10] get excited then you know what I think
[49:12] we got a problem I think we ought to be
[49:13] in the
[49:15] Altar and if you can't see that somebody
[49:17] else can get happy about their salvation
[49:19] and you can't be a you know ridicule
[49:21] somebody about it you ought to be in the
[49:23] altar because I think you need to get
[49:24] right with God that you can't be excited
[49:26] for somebody
[49:28] else right you know when brother Brandon
[49:30] was watching that that young lady she
[49:32] was out there in the aisle she was
[49:33] dancing you know he was like you know
[49:35] his Baptist Doctrine just got too much
[49:37] inside of
[49:39] him but then of a sudden he got in the
[49:41] scripture and realized you know what
[49:42] that was a sign of
[49:45] Victory so well you know what when he
[49:47] got the victory too and realized you
[49:49] know what I can dance also well you know
[49:51] he went out there and joined
[49:54] her and it's the same
[49:57] way if God can move if God's done
[50:01] something for you then you know what you
[50:02] ought to be able to raise your hands and
[50:04] and and express what God has done for
[50:06] you and raise your hand and thank God
[50:08] and stand up and testify about it and if
[50:11] it causes you to move your feet then
[50:13] move your
[50:16] feet you know it's because you
[50:21] know we you know when when we were out
[50:23] in the
[50:24] world you know we didn't we didn't worry
[50:26] about we didn't have no condemnation
[50:28] about anything and you know what if we
[50:30] went somewhere and wanted to dance then
[50:31] you know what we just cut a
[50:35] rug is that not
[50:39] right I done I done I done the white man
[50:44] dance I had to like they said I had to I
[50:46] had the white man over
[50:51] bite but you know what when we want to
[50:53] dance we did it
[50:57] sure and you know what we didn't care
[50:58] what everybody else was thinking we were
[51:00] having a good
[51:03] time but you know what now it's like oh
[51:06] we better not do that we better not
[51:09] raise our
[51:11] hands we can't we you
[51:13] know the deacons might call us and have
[51:16] a have a conversation with
[51:18] us you know the pastor might call us
[51:20] into the
[51:23] study it's like no if you've done that
[51:26] sometimes say why a you done that
[51:28] sooner
[51:32] amen because if if God's real in your
[51:34] life and he's he's done something for
[51:35] you then we shouldn't worry about what
[51:37] everybody else
[51:39] thinks God is real and if he moves then
[51:41] guess what stand up and raise your hand
[51:43] somebody don't you come up here somebody
[51:45] raise your hands clap your hands do this
[51:47] that you don't have to do
[51:50] that if the if something's just like if
[51:53] something's bubbl up inside of you amen
[51:56] then release it
[51:58] amen as brother Wade always says let it
[52:01] out if it's on the inside let it out
[52:04] amen see come to that place where you
[52:06] can just let it out enjoy your
[52:08] salvation live your salvation to the
[52:11] fullest not have these things hold you
[52:15] back because you know what we've allowed
[52:17] the devil to hold us back for too long
[52:19] amen amen we we've allowed the devil to
[52:22] steal our joy and our peace and
[52:25] everything that that that comes with
[52:27] with the with the blessings of God which
[52:29] is our benefits and you know we've lived
[52:31] below our privileges for so long for too
[52:34] long and we ought to just enjoy them
[52:37] amen take these things and and live the
[52:40] the
[52:42] life enjoy your salvation see God has
[52:45] called us because you realize where you
[52:48] came from and what where you're going
[52:49] what God has done for you see when you
[52:52] see these things be
[52:55] rejoiced because when when something
[52:57] stirs when that light flashed across
[52:59] your path when you were in darkness and
[53:00] you see these things and even even today
[53:03] that you you'll be looking at something
[53:05] and all of a sudden the the holy spirit
[53:07] will move and it'll bring something to
[53:09] your remembrance he'll show you
[53:10] something in the scripture and all of a
[53:11] sudden something that you've looked at
[53:13] for years and all of a sudden it becomes
[53:14] clear to you and it's like well you know
[53:16] what I got I want to tell you something
[53:18] I can see this I understand these things
[53:20] why because you know we've probed at
[53:22] them and and looked at them and so so
[53:24] long it's like well I don't know if I'm
[53:26] ever going to get these
[53:29] things well you know because people look
[53:31] you know they they still struggle with
[53:34] you know the the the the word that they
[53:36] don't understand the seals they don't
[53:37] understand the 70 weeks of Daniel and
[53:39] all these things you know they struggle
[53:40] with these things that are in the
[53:42] scripture amen but the Bible says a real
[53:46] true eag will understand
[53:49] am that's what the pro the prophet you
[53:51] know what I'm just going to take the
[53:52] prophet at his
[53:54] word he brought it to you and for us to
[53:57] understand these
[53:58] things it's like well you know what if
[54:00] it takes if it takes me forever that's
[54:02] all right I'm going to keep on fighting
[54:04] I'm gonna keep on
[54:06] pressing and you all of a sudden you you
[54:08] you look at things like well I don't
[54:09] understand that I don't understand that
[54:12] people say things and it's it's so
[54:14] confusing I don't and all of a sudden
[54:17] when it comes to you and it opens up and
[54:19] you real it's
[54:20] like it's so
[54:22] simple and I don't understand how I
[54:24] didn't see that
[54:26] but one of these days you realize you
[54:28] know what it's God's Sovereign time in
[54:30] his time he opens these things up he
[54:33] begins to reveal his word to you see
[54:35] it's
[54:37] it's by by God's grace the light shines
[54:40] across your path and you're because
[54:43] you're a Child of Light and you begin to
[54:46] see the light of God's word and it
[54:48] begins to open up to you and you know
[54:50] what he has more light for you to walk
[54:53] in you know
[54:56] I'm I don't know if I've ever told this
[54:58] I've shared it with a few people but I
[55:00] don't know if I've ever shared this
[55:02] publicly or not
[55:05] but you know I was I was thinking
[55:08] about years ago I was talking to brother
[55:13] Dale and you know I i' had
[55:17] a I had this
[55:20] dream and I was walking in light but it
[55:23] wasn't it wasn't
[55:27] bright
[55:29] light it was almost like dusk but I
[55:32] there was light I was walking
[55:36] in and I began to
[55:39] walk and I got to a
[55:41] point where the light started to go
[55:46] away and I just kept walking and
[55:48] walking and I got into
[55:52] darkness and I was walking down this
[55:54] path and I got to the place where I was
[55:57] by
[55:58] myself and I was in this
[56:02] darkness and I come to this place and I
[56:04] realized you know what I'm going the
[56:06] wrong
[56:08] way and I turned around and I started
[56:12] walking the way from where I was
[56:14] walking and I didn't know where I was
[56:16] going to walk but the only thing I could
[56:18] see in the distance was the
[56:20] light and it started like the sun was
[56:23] coming
[56:24] up and I to walk toward
[56:28] that and I kept on walking I kept on
[56:32] walking and I got to a place brother Bob
[56:34] where when I got to the when I got into
[56:37] this area it was like I was walking into
[56:41] the
[56:42] sun and it was just like this you
[56:45] couldn't imagine the the amount of light
[56:47] that was shining in this place it was so
[56:50] bright and it was like I was amazed that
[56:52] I wasn't blinded by
[56:54] it but I just kept kept walking in that
[56:57] light and you know it just kept growing
[57:00] and growing it was just increasing it
[57:01] was just amazing and I just felt like I
[57:03] was walking right into the sun it just
[57:05] kept going and going and going and you
[57:07] know I was telling brother Dale one day
[57:08] I was telling about my
[57:11] dream and he told me he said just walk
[57:14] in the
[57:17] light because you know you wherever
[57:19] you're at and you come to a place and
[57:21] realize you're not walking where you
[57:22] ought to be when you get on the right
[57:24] path just keep walking right and you
[57:27] know there in the Scripture it tells us
[57:30] that you know he said he said that there
[57:33] would come a
[57:34] day you know the the the light the sun
[57:38] would shine as seven times there in the
[57:42] scripture in the Old Testament you know
[57:43] you'd see this light and you know it was
[57:45] so bright and you just kept walking in
[57:47] it but you know that's what God has
[57:48] called us to you know because whe
[57:50] whether how light you think how bright
[57:52] you think the light is and you think
[57:54] well I'm walking in light or I can't
[57:56] attain to that you know if you just keep
[57:59] walking in God if you just keep walking
[58:00] in God you no matter where you go you
[58:03] you think well I can't attain to that
[58:04] you just keep walking and see if God
[58:06] don't bring you to that place he just
[58:09] you just keep walking and it just keeps
[58:11] getting brighter and brighter and
[58:12] brighter and you know you think well I I
[58:15] I can't get to that place or or you know
[58:16] I I'll never get there you you just keep
[58:18] walking in the light that you're in
[58:19] right now because if God has called you
[58:21] and he puts you on the right path then
[58:23] you know what it'll just continue to get
[58:25] brighter and brighter and brighter and
[58:26] you know you just keep walking because
[58:28] you know what that same light that
[58:29] you're walking in today will continue to
[58:31] grow and it'll take you right to a body
[58:33] change the light is here and all you got
[58:36] to do is walk in it and when the light
[58:38] shines in your in in your pathway and it
[58:41] begins to light you just keep walking in
[58:43] that light and you know what because one
[58:45] of these days it becomes so great you're
[58:46] like wow but you know what that's what
[58:48] God wants us to do to walk in that
[58:55] light many times we we look at ourselves
[58:58] and we we don't realize what God has
[59:00] done for
[59:04] us and sometimes our our problem is not
[59:07] looking at ourselves but looking at what
[59:09] God said about us walk in the light as
[59:12] he's in the light continue to walk I
[59:16] pray it's been a blessing to you let's
