[10:28] us now in jesus name
[10:30] amen
[10:32] romans 8.
[10:35] i'm going to start in verse 28
[10:39] through 31
[10:41] and we know that all things work
[10:42] together for good to them
[10:45] that love god to them who are thee
[10:47] called according to his purpose
[10:49] for whom he did for no
[10:52] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[10:55] to the image of his son that he might be
[10:57] the firstborn among many brethren
[11:00] notice
[11:02] i wrote this in my bible because i write
[11:04] it
[11:05] i like to keep things
[11:07] i was talking about this morning where
[11:08] you used the word are there you know
[11:10] what it was speaking of or the word is i
[11:12] like to keep up with those things and
[11:14] look at that 29th verse
[11:17] for we know
[11:19] for whom we he did for no
[11:22] he also did predestinate
[11:25] to be
[11:28] that's a future extent
[11:30] right
[11:31] conformed to the image of his son
[11:34] that he might be the firstborn among
[11:35] many brothers now watch moreover whom he
[11:38] did predestinate that's already done
[11:42] you know so i do those things in my
[11:44] bible because i like to keep it
[11:46] you know it makes my my learning stay
[11:48] that way anyway all right moreover whom
[11:50] he did predestinate them he also called
[11:54] already happened and whom he called then
[11:57] he also justified already happened
[12:00] in whom
[12:01] he justified them he also glorified all
[12:04] of those is past tense all the way
[12:06] through that verse
[12:07] what shall we then say to these things
[12:10] if god be for us who can be against us
[12:13] all right let's go over to ephesians
[12:17] 1
[12:19] pick up verse 11
[12:22] in whom also
[12:24] we have obtained an inheritance
[12:27] being
[12:29] already happened done finished
[12:32] predestinated according to the purpose
[12:34] of him who worketh all things
[12:37] after the council of his own will you
[12:40] may be seated the lord add his blessing
[12:42] to the reading of the word
[12:45] now
[12:46] to back up just to hire this morning
[12:48] because
[12:49] you will see
[12:51] what we're trying to do the lord willing
[12:53] throughout this message
[12:55] and
[12:56] you know
[12:58] i say this is still a background for
[13:00] what
[13:00] the point i want to bring out or the
[13:02] thought
[13:04] so we may stay in this part
[13:08] for a little bit you know
[13:10] because the title will be for a while
[13:12] probably
[13:13] how does god predestinate
[13:17] all right
[13:18] now how does he predestinate
[13:22] then what does that mean so we will be
[13:25] tying with that
[13:26] but backing up like we were talking this
[13:29] morning
[13:34] of doing you know
[13:37] the the message the way i've tried to
[13:39] bring
[13:39] blessed is the man to whom god will not
[13:41] impute sin
[13:43] we found that that
[13:46] really
[13:47] the man that god won't impute sin to
[13:51] is
[13:52] the man that's not guilty
[13:57] you know he's not guilty
[14:00] because if he's guilty
[14:03] he has to deal with it
[14:05] so it's to the one that's not guilty
[14:08] all right
[14:10] and the man that god won't impute sin to
[14:13] is the lord jesus christ
[14:16] i hope you get that in your mind and
[14:18] keep that thought
[14:20] because he's not guilty
[14:23] he's guilty in that he took my place
[14:26] my guilt
[14:28] and took it upon himself to go pay the
[14:30] price for it
[14:32] but the real man that god won't impute
[14:35] sin
[14:36] is the one that's born again
[14:39] and there's only one born to get
[14:40] experience right
[14:42] all right
[14:43] so then you you see what i'm i was
[14:45] driving at
[14:46] right the man that god won't impute that
[14:49] too is the one that we read after life
[14:51] to those that are in christ jesus
[14:56] and that that seed remaineth any man he
[14:58] cannot sin what that seed cannot sin
[15:03] the person that that's dwelling in
[15:06] even though we have eternal life
[15:09] in our soul
[15:11] still in the rest of our being we can
[15:14] still do wrong
[15:16] and we'll do wrong because we are of
[15:18] that nature
[15:20] in ways
[15:21] because you're not born again in your
[15:23] body you're not born again in your
[15:25] spirit you're only born again in your
[15:27] soul
[15:28] the reason we're still here is that
[15:30] reason
[15:31] that's the reason we're still here if on
[15:33] the day of pentecost
[15:35] everything had been totally made
[15:37] manifest then they walked right off the
[15:39] earth
[15:40] and you and i wouldn't be here
[15:42] so you better thank god
[15:45] for the truth that
[15:46] god didn't do it that way
[15:49] i heard the other day somebody was
[15:51] talking about
[15:52] you know that
[15:53] they were already redeemed well i
[15:55] believe you're redeemed
[15:58] i believe we're redeemed
[16:00] i believe the price has been paid
[16:03] but it's got to be applied
[16:07] and it not being applied then
[16:10] we're still in bad shape
[16:11] israel was redeemed at calvary
[16:14] there's not another calvary to redeem
[16:16] israel there was redeemed but they are
[16:19] not even in their redemptive plan
[16:21] at this time
[16:23] so then we must hold it to that point
[16:25] and think about
[16:27] what we're doing all right
[16:30] now see then it'll it'll tie together
[16:32] that you'll see
[16:34] that this man in the bible
[16:38] is the man christ jesus
[16:41] i've preached to you for many many years
[16:45] wade's preached it good many times about
[16:48] genesis 1 26 26-27
[16:52] you know let us make man
[16:54] and that was the theophany man
[16:57] that was christ
[16:59] i believe every born-again believer
[17:04] every born-again believer
[17:09] there's just one
[17:11] theophany
[17:13] and that's christ
[17:15] but i've got one up younger well
[17:19] that's what i said about our doctrine
[17:20] see
[17:21] instead of listening to what somebody
[17:23] says
[17:24] we're already as quick as something said
[17:26] we
[17:27] we click and you don't hear the rest of
[17:30] it
[17:30] uh
[17:32] i said three times recently that we were
[17:35] leaving at 10 o'clock
[17:37] yesterday and sister trudy came at 10 30
[17:41] and
[17:42] so their divisor away to
[17:45] determine
[17:46] tennessee is
[17:48] 10 o'clock
[17:49] everything else is 10 30. so that's
[17:52] not throwing off on her just making a
[17:54] point
[17:55] you can say something over and over and
[17:57] over
[17:59] but people their mind is drifting
[18:01] they're looking they're doing something
[18:03] scratching out doing something writing
[18:04] something doing any and you can't listen
[18:07] when you're doing that
[18:10] i mean there's no way
[18:12] for you to be able to understand what's
[18:14] being said
[18:15] if you're not listening
[18:17] so i like for you to listen
[18:20] then make up your mind
[18:23] i like to do that i give everybody the
[18:25] benefit of the doubt
[18:27] i hear preachers say something
[18:29] that you take they're very wordy that
[18:31] they say and they're totally off the
[18:33] message
[18:35] but in a minute you let him
[18:37] bring his point right
[18:39] and you'll see it it's all right well
[18:42] let's let's get to point sit down and
[18:44] listen
[18:45] and cut off all your computers
[18:47] you know
[18:49] them things that's running that keeps
[18:50] you going out ahead of me and just
[18:53] listen
[18:55] well
[18:56] a background
[18:58] that there is a man
[19:02] that god will not impute sin to
[19:05] and that man is jesus
[19:08] christ and that man is now living in you
[19:13] by the new birth
[19:15] so that seed cannot sin
[19:18] that's remaining in you right now we're
[19:20] going to get down to some things later
[19:23] about this
[19:24] but we're going to try to hold it and
[19:26] just
[19:27] gradually go along
[19:29] like i said now this is a background
[19:33] so listen to the background
[19:36] let me read one i had left over from
[19:38] this morning
[19:39] go ahead brother
[19:41] and pull up the 1a i guess we called it
[19:46] let's listen to brother branham say
[19:47] something about this
[19:50] man that won't be imputed
[19:52] sin too
[19:54] and listen to what he says about it
[19:57] this is taken from the serpent seed 1958
[20:00] 9 28 evening paragraph 91
[20:05] did not david say
[20:08] blessed is the man who god will not
[20:11] reconcile
[20:13] and impute sin too
[20:16] god don't hold the sin
[20:18] against this creature
[20:24] the one that's not guilty
[20:28] that's strong that isn't skinned milk
[20:30] but that's the bible
[20:32] god will not reconcile to the righteous
[20:35] god by his grace
[20:38] through predestination
[20:41] not willing that any should perish
[20:44] but all might come to repentance
[20:47] but being infinite
[20:48] and knowed who would come
[20:50] and who would not come
[20:53] he could predestinate
[20:54] everything
[20:56] to work to his will
[20:59] if he didn't do
[21:00] it you know if he didn't know if he
[21:03] didn't do it
[21:05] why did he permit sin
[21:07] in the first place
[21:09] when he was a savior
[21:11] i mean what the reason he promised
[21:13] because he's a savior all right
[21:16] if he'd never been a sinner
[21:18] he'd never been a savior
[21:20] their attribute within him could not be
[21:23] pulled out
[21:24] all right
[21:26] so then we're tying
[21:28] predestination
[21:31] into
[21:33] the man or this creature
[21:36] that sin is not
[21:38] imputed unto
[21:42] and remember the thought this morning
[21:46] it's in christ
[21:48] if we're not in christ
[21:50] they don't even worry about anything
[21:53] you know might as well forget it
[21:56] but if we can get to the point of
[21:57] understanding
[22:01] you know
[22:02] these things maybe we can
[22:05] get a better understanding but i'm
[22:07] asking you the question now
[22:09] there's a lot said about predestination
[22:12] there's a lot said about it this way i'm
[22:14] talking about in the message people
[22:17] used to target organized religion you
[22:18] know
[22:20] one way one way back and forth
[22:22] but even now in the message of the hour
[22:26] forgive me my sinuses
[22:29] keep acting up on me
[22:30] but
[22:31] i'll croak it out if nothing else
[22:35] but there's an argument over
[22:37] predestination
[22:40] and you use the word predestination but
[22:42] around said it's a bad word
[22:44] used before an untrained congregation
[22:49] but he said i use it you're a tabernacle
[22:53] so he was meaning there was or to be
[22:55] trained right right
[22:57] and i shouldn't be speaking to people
[22:59] today
[23:00] that is not trained at least to
[23:03] know some things
[23:05] about predestination
[23:08] and how it is and what it is
[23:12] but i'm asking the question how does god
[23:15] predestinate
[23:18] you know
[23:20] and how can he do it without being a
[23:22] respecter
[23:24] of persons
[23:28] does he pick
[23:29] some people
[23:32] and reject others
[23:36] all right
[23:37] so to me now it's very simple
[23:39] once the prophet explained it
[23:41] and i would invite you to go home take a
[23:44] computer
[23:45] run in predestination
[23:47] run in for knowledge
[23:49] and just read for days it's going to
[23:52] take you days to read
[23:54] the things that he says about
[23:57] but i want you to notice the connection
[24:00] so when we get started in a minute
[24:02] we'll be starting in the 50s
[24:05] and going through out the message
[24:08] through the years up to
[24:11] the 60s you know
[24:12] 65
[24:14] to show that he kept the pattern
[24:18] and not as some people say well he
[24:20] believed this but he changed his thought
[24:22] here you know
[24:24] they say well we believe
[24:26] he was right before the seals broke
[24:29] but then after the scene you know was
[24:31] wrong before the seal bro and right
[24:32] after they broke
[24:35] and people even said the son of man had
[24:37] to come down straighten him out
[24:39] okay you believe what you want to
[24:43] i just don't believe it that way and
[24:46] that's why i like to give you quotes
[24:47] here and here in that way you can't
[24:50] argue the point
[24:52] about it but what do you think about
[24:54] predestination
[24:58] it was a major doctrine in the baptist
[25:02] and actually the church was split
[25:05] by two brothers over
[25:07] predestination and caused a
[25:10] great friction
[25:11] and divided the baptist church
[25:15] he came on into the presbyterian
[25:19] and they had a
[25:21] predestination doctrine
[25:24] all right
[25:25] let's come on over into the message
[25:27] and everything you know and
[25:30] people still don't seem to want to get
[25:31] it together
[25:35] because they work take the word
[25:38] predestinate
[25:44] and predestinate means to
[25:47] determine before
[25:49] go ahead and pull that up brother
[25:53] this is
[25:54] strong's concordance
[25:59] to give you the definition of
[26:01] predestination
[26:03] 4309 and what is it
[26:06] determined before
[26:08] ordained
[26:12] to predetermine
[26:14] to decide beforehand
[26:18] and in the new testament
[26:20] of god decreeing
[26:23] from eternity
[26:26] to for ordain
[26:27] a point beforehand
[26:30] now how can god
[26:35] predetermine something
[26:39] and not be a respecter of persons
[26:43] you know
[26:45] how can it be that he can do that and
[26:47] not be a choosing god
[26:50] you know
[26:51] to choose one reject the other
[26:56] and yet we read in about romans 9 there
[26:58] about
[27:00] jacob have i loved
[27:03] and he saw how i hated
[27:06] and that was before the bible said
[27:08] either one of them was born
[27:12] so how could god predetermine
[27:17] and deal with
[27:19] jacob bring him out to be
[27:21] israel
[27:24] and reject esau
[27:26] without a respecter of persons
[27:30] without a choosing factor
[27:33] that he would say i'll take this one
[27:36] and reject that one
[27:39] what do you think
[27:43] what do you think about it how that god
[27:45] runs his business
[27:50] i think it's a wonderful
[27:53] beautiful understanding
[27:58] but i think it needs understanding
[28:01] to get the house of understanding
[28:04] really we need a revelation
[28:06] understanding is only argumentative form
[28:09] you know you can argue over knowledge
[28:12] but you can't argue about a revelation
[28:17] that's a finished product
[28:20] as i say in today that means something
[28:23] present
[28:26] bless it is the man see now present
[28:30] all right
[28:31] revelation is not future tense nor past
[28:34] tense you can have a revelation of the
[28:36] future
[28:38] but revelation is really present tense
[28:40] eternity
[28:42] all right so we need a revelation more
[28:44] than anything
[28:45] but if not we're going to argue
[28:50] but at least we have one
[28:52] uh
[28:54] point
[28:55] or thought
[28:57] that organized religion didn't have
[29:03] we've got a prophet
[29:07] and we got his message
[29:10] all right
[29:11] see they didn't have an absolute type of
[29:13] form back there
[29:15] they didn't have something they could go
[29:17] back to
[29:18] they could go over here and say well
[29:19] luther said this others said well wesley
[29:22] said this
[29:23] it was just
[29:24] you know
[29:27] but we're supposed to have one message
[29:32] in one revelation
[29:34] all right
[29:36] now
[29:37] in doing that then
[29:39] how does god predestinate
[29:46] how does he make things work
[29:49] to bring out his will his thoughts
[29:52] it's like what we started with
[29:56] that
[29:57] had been not been uh
[30:00] sickness
[30:02] it was not been a healer
[30:05] and they'd not been a lost person
[30:08] they would not be a savior
[30:11] all right
[30:13] so if he was going to
[30:16] if it was going to be that away
[30:20] then
[30:23] he could predestinate
[30:29] if not then we're off the word
[30:32] because you just got him flimsy like us
[30:34] or something you know just
[30:37] doing it and i never understood it
[30:39] always the meanest kid in the crowd is
[30:41] the one that's loved the most
[30:43] you know
[30:45] you agree
[30:48] you got a bunch of kids and the meanest
[30:50] one always gets everything handed to him
[30:53] or her
[30:55] i don't understand that god don't work
[30:57] that away
[30:59] he doesn't run his business that way
[31:02] he he he doesn't do it
[31:04] all right
[31:05] but the main thing is do we believe
[31:10] that god is
[31:11] infinite
[31:15] do we believe that
[31:17] that there is a god
[31:20] and that there's no changing of his ways
[31:27] and he's eternal amen
[31:30] and he can never have a new thought
[31:35] his first thought
[31:36] is eternal
[31:39] and he can never have another one
[31:45] listen yesterday was or
[31:48] day before right around talking about
[31:50] that god can't give a revelation and
[31:52] then give something contrary to that
[31:54] he said now he can give a revelation
[31:58] and then he can add to that
[32:01] see
[32:02] like he first said you know in the
[32:04] garden i put enmity between that promise
[32:07] of christ
[32:09] then designate that that would come
[32:10] through abraham
[32:13] then designate it more in the word or
[32:15] open up the revelation
[32:18] that it would come to david
[32:20] and then come down to christ
[32:23] but that's not added revelation
[32:27] because you can't add to the revelation
[32:30] it's opening up of what was sealed
[32:33] in that revelation
[32:35] because revelation is eternal
[32:37] all right
[32:39] so then to look at it we have to
[32:41] first comprehend that god is real
[32:45] eternal
[32:48] there's no way to argue with him
[32:52] as it says in roman i believe it is how
[32:54] can the thing formed
[32:56] say why did you form me this way
[33:01] my brother methodist minister
[33:06] he said god made him a sinner
[33:08] and could not judge him for being sinful
[33:18] i said god didn't make you a sinner
[33:22] i said you made yourself one
[33:27] see we want to blame adam and eve for
[33:29] making us sinners
[33:31] that's not so
[33:33] we're the sinners
[33:35] we are the ones that just set in motion
[33:38] a situation
[33:40] it would fall down upon us
[33:43] but we are the sinners
[33:45] that way everybody stands before god
[33:49] as a personal being
[33:52] and he's not judging as a group
[33:54] that's right amen he's judging us too we
[33:57] are
[33:59] see we must first believe
[34:01] if you think that he doesn't know
[34:03] everything then there's no nobody
[34:05] talking about anything
[34:07] right
[34:09] there's no need to talk about anything
[34:10] in the bible if we don't believe god
[34:12] knows everything
[34:15] but how does he
[34:17] predestinate
[34:22] how does he do that he said well i
[34:24] believe it's this way
[34:27] let's just read some things
[34:30] go ahead with number two
[34:33] it's 1956 1207
[34:36] and this is gifts
[34:39] e 15.
[34:42] now the first place the bible said
[34:45] that gifts and callings are without
[34:47] repentance
[34:51] it's something that god by sovereign
[34:54] grace
[34:56] put into the church
[34:58] i'm not going to deal with that subject
[35:00] of gifts and callings
[35:02] i will deal with it
[35:04] later in a message
[35:07] but get what he's saying
[35:11] it's what
[35:12] give some calling of god being without
[35:14] repentance you don't repent to get a
[35:16] gift
[35:17] you're either born with it you don't
[35:18] have it that's one way or the other
[35:21] you know you either got it don't have it
[35:24] it's something that god by sovereign
[35:26] grace
[35:31] no
[35:33] i believe he did predetermine
[35:37] some things
[35:41] we will get back to that later but just
[35:44] to get the thought in your mind
[35:48] see god does that himself
[35:50] it's a work and an act of god
[35:52] by foreknowledge he predestinates these
[35:54] things to happen
[35:56] now as i say
[35:57] god is not willing that any woods one
[36:00] should perish
[36:01] but in the very beginning god knew
[36:04] it would be saved
[36:06] and who would perish
[36:09] now did he know
[36:10] it as i said god is not willing anybody
[36:13] to purse but in the very beginning god
[36:15] knew it would be saved and it would be
[36:17] who would perish
[36:18] for knowledge
[36:20] let him know
[36:24] that if he's the infinite god
[36:28] why
[36:30] he he certainly cannot
[36:32] he's not willing that any should perish
[36:35] but he knew from the beginning
[36:37] in your fly ever flee every person that
[36:41] would ever be on the earth
[36:42] he knew them before the foundation of
[36:44] the world
[36:45] because he's infinite
[36:47] all right
[36:48] you agree with that now
[36:50] he knew everything
[36:54] he could predestinate
[36:59] his worker and act of god
[37:02] and by foreknowledge
[37:05] he praying estimates these things to
[37:07] happen
[37:09] all right
[37:12] now you immediately see that we're going
[37:13] to tie together for knowledge in
[37:15] predestination
[37:18] because the only way you can approach it
[37:19] to me now
[37:23] i made a statement there we'll come back
[37:25] to it later
[37:27] not dealing with gifts and callings of
[37:28] god
[37:30] but dealing with the fact that
[37:33] god did predetermine some things
[37:42] look at the next one and we'll get that
[37:44] point then we'll get back on our thought
[37:47] harvest time 1964 1212
[37:51] paragraph 122-124
[37:56] then god after adam had failed
[38:01] tried
[38:02] by the word and fail
[38:04] that's what happened to adam
[38:08] god continued in his creation
[38:13] and once
[38:15] to find a
[38:16] man who would live every word
[38:22] now look
[38:24] he's tried to find a man that is
[38:27] live the word of his age
[38:35] now you see
[38:36] god scattered his word out right
[38:42] because he could
[38:48] and we'll get back to this just so long
[38:49] as you won't
[38:51] jump too far on me
[38:53] we will get back to this
[38:55] it is not the person that comes
[38:57] predestinated eternally from god
[39:01] he said it's the word or seed
[39:04] all right so hold that in your mind now
[39:09] but he done it because he could
[39:11] so he scattered his word
[39:13] down through the ages
[39:18] it's not a haphazard thing that moses
[39:20] fell here jeremiah fell here
[39:23] ezekiel fell here
[39:25] you know
[39:27] and all of those built the body of
[39:30] christ
[39:31] all right that's not coincidental
[39:34] and it's not coincidental to have a
[39:38] luther or wesley of pentecost
[39:43] and the word to come down to the ages
[39:47] he is infinite
[39:50] and he is
[39:51] he is omnipresent
[39:54] now
[39:56] watch it he's omniscient
[39:59] therefore he knows all the time
[40:02] he can't be present everywhere right
[40:07] so god is not in our terminologies of
[40:10] the word omnipresent
[40:14] you see
[40:16] what he's god
[40:18] no
[40:19] he's a person
[40:21] he's a
[40:22] being do i need to go through those
[40:26] he probably said he's not like the wind
[40:30] he's a person
[40:31] so if he's a person
[40:33] he can't be omnipresent
[40:37] yeah but you're saying god no i'm not
[40:39] limiting god
[40:40] he did his own
[40:42] i didn't have anything to do with it
[40:47] he's not omnipresent in that he's not
[40:49] ever were
[40:51] always say he's not up on the moon today
[40:53] because as far as i know there's not
[40:54] supposed to be any anybody up there
[40:58] you know
[40:59] so he doesn't have to be there
[41:02] so he's a person
[41:05] all right now he's omniscient
[41:08] we're going to read these
[41:10] which means he knows everything
[41:13] and being omniscient
[41:16] he can be where he needs to be
[41:20] are you with me
[41:21] see then he's not on the present
[41:25] he's a being he's a person
[41:28] he's just not a spirit which oh god is a
[41:31] spirit he's just every word is floating
[41:33] no that's
[41:35] what i said
[41:36] if you don't believe in god correctly
[41:39] don't worry about predestination
[41:44] all right
[41:46] see watch them
[41:52] he is omnipresent
[41:54] omniscient therefore he knows all that
[41:57] he can't be present ever
[42:01] by being omniscient
[42:04] knowing all things then he can be
[42:06] present everywhere
[42:09] right
[42:10] all right
[42:11] because that's the way he predestinates
[42:13] us
[42:15] by foreknowledge
[42:17] not because he desired that this person
[42:20] should be saved
[42:21] and this one lost
[42:24] but he knew he would be lost and who
[42:26] would be saved
[42:28] see therefore by his full knowledge
[42:30] he can predestinate
[42:32] he makes everything work to his glory
[42:37] that's what his attributes are doing
[42:40] explaining to his glory one vessel of
[42:42] honor one of dishonor
[42:45] but it's god that maketh it not him that
[42:47] willeth or him that runeth
[42:49] but god that showeth mercy all right
[42:52] now
[42:58] the way he predestinates
[43:02] my foreknowledge
[43:07] he knew who would be lost
[43:09] and he knew who would be saved
[43:13] okay
[43:14] now
[43:16] he says he doesn't will get to it he
[43:19] doesn't pick one lose the other
[43:21] so that does away with the doctrine
[43:24] of the people of the message
[43:26] that
[43:28] you know
[43:30] i'm the certain seed i can be saved
[43:34] the people of the message
[43:36] it split over that point
[43:39] a lot of the preachers believe
[43:41] you're then adam you can be saved
[43:44] but if your genealogy within the beast
[43:46] you can't be
[43:49] now i want to see that in the bible or
[43:51] the prophet's message
[43:55] that would be putting it where he would
[43:57] handpick
[44:04] that would put it that were
[44:08] we say serpent seed can't be saved
[44:12] what is serpent seed
[44:15] i'm looking at the seed of the serpent
[44:18] i know the preachers don't like that one
[44:21] but i'm looking at you
[44:24] are you looking at me
[44:30] we were all brother brown said born
[44:33] between
[44:35] eve
[44:37] and the serpent
[44:42] what he says now you need to quote
[44:45] now i know
[44:46] that there was a lineage that comes from
[44:48] the beast we know that there was cain
[44:51] his descendants etc
[44:54] there was a lineage that come from abel
[44:59] right
[45:00] coming
[45:02] down ourselves as you'd say taking it
[45:05] home
[45:10] but when you start trying to deal with
[45:12] it what are you going to do when brother
[45:14] ryan said when it come to the flood
[45:18] it was so intermingled
[45:21] until no one
[45:23] could
[45:24] decide what
[45:27] i mean
[45:30] see that way it comes up with all these
[45:32] doctrines
[45:34] that they teach well you always was
[45:36] eternal
[45:38] that comes from predestination
[45:44] that you could be saved but other people
[45:46] couldn't
[45:48] well
[45:51] i think i've got it in here where jacob
[45:53] and esau
[45:55] but around him i'm pretty sure i got it
[45:58] he said both parents holy
[46:05] that's what he said said both parents
[46:07] holy
[46:09] and one of them comes a rascal
[46:12] the other one becomes seed
[46:15] that's what everybody does once
[46:17] they want some kind of a
[46:19] tantalizing
[46:22] thing
[46:22] to
[46:24] hold with the people
[46:26] oh ain't that wonderful i was always a
[46:28] seed
[46:34] what kind
[46:38] like everybody says brother brandon saw
[46:40] me there
[46:43] well remember he was in hell and beyond
[46:45] the curtain of time
[46:47] and he saw faith in hell and he saw
[46:49] people in heaven now which one are we
[46:56] well what do you mean i was in heaven
[46:58] yeah
[47:01] but do you understand yes
[47:04] it's not that he desired
[47:07] that this person should be saved
[47:10] or that person should not be saved
[47:15] but he said by his foreknowledge
[47:18] now i love this one because there's a
[47:20] lot of these
[47:21] if you'll run it in a predestination
[47:25] looks back to poor knowledge for
[47:26] knowledge looks to destiny
[47:29] but just to pick one we've got one the
[47:31] power of god
[47:33] praise in 1955
[47:36] said the word predestinate that's not a
[47:38] good word to use
[47:39] the word for knowledge is better
[47:42] predestination looks back to
[47:43] foreknowledge
[47:44] and foreknowledge looks to destiny
[47:50] but god not making
[47:52] set in order a little hole that you have
[47:55] to go through
[47:56] and can't go no other way
[48:00] but god in order to be god you know the
[48:03] end from the beginning so he could
[48:05] predict it and set things in order to
[48:07] happen
[48:08] now
[48:10] predestination looks back to
[48:12] foreknowledge
[48:15] and foreknowledge looks to destiny
[48:18] all right now the way i look at that
[48:24] i look at that with a thought in mind
[48:30] predestination here i am here
[48:36] looks
[48:38] back to foreknowledge
[48:41] okay i'll move over here
[48:43] to illustrate right
[48:46] that's predestination this is for
[48:47] knowledge
[48:50] so if predestination
[48:52] looks back to foreknowledge
[48:58] which one's first
[49:04] you know we're going to do away with all
[49:06] that predestination doctrine amen we're
[49:08] going to talk about fore knowledge
[49:11] so if predestination
[49:14] looks back to foreknowledge
[49:17] and foreknowledge can look to your
[49:19] destiny
[49:22] then which one's first
[49:25] did predetermining or predestination
[49:28] come first ordered for knowledge
[49:32] for knowledge was first
[49:37] carnal illustration
[49:39] with a good thought
[49:42] see so don't worry about predestination
[49:46] be concerned about foreknowledge
[49:48] now
[49:52] according to webster
[49:56] foreknowledge is
[49:59] the fact of knowing
[50:01] before
[50:08] so then there's got to be a
[50:09] foreknowledge first
[50:16] and then there can be a predetermining
[50:19] because of that foreknowledge
[50:23] okay
[50:25] so if it's for knowledge
[50:29] then predestination looks to
[50:31] foreknowledge for knowledge looks back
[50:33] to destiny we back up to foreknowledge
[50:40] and when we look at it in four knowledge
[50:43] foreknowledge is the fact or act
[50:46] of knowing before
[50:51] any
[50:52] problems the actual fact of knowing
[50:55] before
[50:58] all right now what did he know before
[51:08] what did he know before
[51:10] that he would predestinate by what he
[51:12] knowed
[51:15] not predestinate by his desires
[51:20] but the bible said your desire to all be
[51:22] saved
[51:26] so you're going back to foreknowledge
[51:29] and foreknowledge is a fact of
[51:32] and the infinite god
[51:36] that
[51:37] is not choosing
[51:41] but he's knowing that's right amen
[51:45] don't you think god knew what we'd do
[51:47] before we got here
[51:50] on then
[51:51] get away from predestination
[51:53] that's what brought around said it's a
[51:54] hard word
[51:56] or a bad word you'll call it
[51:58] why because everybody's locked on it
[52:01] predestination that's determined before
[52:03] so god determined this so then that
[52:05] person didn't have no hopes because god
[52:07] made it that away
[52:16] that's determining
[52:20] we back up to foreknowledge right
[52:25] we'll get down to where brother brown
[52:26] says it what i said
[52:29] brother
[52:30] branham where were we
[52:34] he said before the foundation of the
[52:35] world in god's mind
[52:39] said where we spirits back there
[52:43] he said no
[52:44] we wasn't nothing
[52:46] it was only in god's mind
[52:51] now you mean to tell me that we believe
[52:53] in an infinite god that can save our
[52:55] souls that can heal our bodies that will
[52:58] be able to change us
[53:00] and and all the things that we try to
[53:02] believe of salvation
[53:04] but yet we're serving a peanut brain god
[53:11] that didn't know before the world
[53:18] now we get back to the attributes
[53:21] of god
[53:23] attribute of a healer savior
[53:26] etc
[53:28] now he had them in him
[53:32] before there was any foreknowledge
[53:38] god didn't gain attributes as he came
[53:40] down see
[53:42] you know
[53:44] first you needed a savior then you
[53:46] needed a healer and you needed this or
[53:48] that
[53:49] no
[53:50] he had those attributes
[53:53] within him
[53:57] but he's going to get him displayed
[54:01] now
[54:02] how can he do that
[54:05] and not make you a sinner
[54:10] you gotta have a center right
[54:12] right
[54:14] you can kind of deal it down around
[54:16] about the
[54:18] sickness you know
[54:20] when you come to salvation you can't
[54:22] deal it all dally
[54:23] you got to look at it front up
[54:26] how could he
[54:30] make you lost
[54:34] and it display his attribute
[54:41] that would be determining
[54:45] beforehand
[54:48] well let me back up what a storm i want
[54:50] to go
[54:53] predestination
[54:55] looking to foreknowledge
[54:58] back to it for knowledge look into
[55:00] destiny
[55:02] the destiny was already determined
[55:05] but not by predetermining factor
[55:08] about foreknowledge
[55:14] how does god predestinate
[55:18] without being a respecter of persons
[55:25] he predestinates by his foreknowledge
[55:29] but in his foreknowledge
[55:31] he knew do you need these quotes
[55:35] he knew that if he made us we'd fall
[55:39] you need that that's what your prophet
[55:40] said
[55:41] he knew we'd fall by making this way he
[55:43] did
[55:44] so you see him in the eve
[55:49] right
[55:51] we want to blame me for every bit of it
[55:53] but he made adam
[55:55] with all the products and everything
[55:58] for physical reproduction
[56:04] didn't want to blame me for the whole
[56:06] thing
[56:07] just remember the bible says an adam all
[56:09] die
[56:10] so let's don't harp about the women too
[56:12] much
[56:16] let's get it straight
[56:22] he made them the way he made them
[56:24] knowing they were going to fall
[56:28] right did the fall bring into being uh
[56:33] products within the body of even adam to
[56:35] reproduce children
[56:42] no
[56:44] the only thing that adam and eve didn't
[56:47] have the rest of us got was a belly
[56:49] button
[56:53] they didn't get the belly button
[56:58] you've never come with one
[57:00] god creator just like adam no belly
[57:02] button
[57:05] rest of us no problem we got a belly
[57:07] button
[57:07] big ones little ones ugly ones pretty
[57:09] ones
[57:11] belly buttons
[57:13] all right
[57:15] do that to make your life a little bit
[57:17] get you shaken
[57:20] but
[57:24] now are we dealing with predestination
[57:29] as determining beforehand
[57:34] are we dealing with foreknowledge
[57:37] that is way back
[57:38] behind the predestination factor
[57:44] see the bible said that
[57:46] jesus christ stood as a lamb
[57:48] slain before the foundation of the world
[57:54] that was before we ever come into being
[57:57] upon earth right
[58:00] and he says your name was written in the
[58:02] lounge book of life
[58:04] before the foundation of the world
[58:07] it will never be written in the lounge
[58:10] book of life
[58:13] book of life you can argue
[58:16] not two books
[58:18] two sections of one book
[58:22] invisible union you just got two reading
[58:23] one leads out to the other
[58:25] all right
[58:27] but see
[58:29] we want to go with it
[58:32] and try to predetermine it
[58:35] without going by foreknowledge
[58:38] but it will go by foreign knowledge
[58:41] we've got the problem solved that's
[58:42] right
[58:45] you know
[58:46] why because predestination has got to be
[58:48] out here in front of four knowledge
[58:51] right i kept walking backwards and forth
[58:53] to get you to see that right
[58:56] predestination looks
[58:59] to foreknowledge foreknowledge looks
[59:01] back
[59:03] going by his predestination to a
[59:05] foreknowledge
[59:08] all right
[59:09] now
[59:11] and in doing that
[59:14] little brother said he
[59:17] he done it so in order to be god
[59:23] he couldn't be a savior couldn't be a
[59:24] healer it couldn't be all of those
[59:26] things
[59:27] had it not been for the fact
[59:29] that mankind was going to fall
[59:33] now here is where we go
[59:35] well if he made us knowing was going to
[59:37] fall we didn't have a choice
[59:39] were you messing up
[59:49] you're going to predetermine
[59:51] and leaving foreknowledge out of it
[59:56] now did jesus physically die before the
[59:59] foundation of the world
[1:00:03] you know
[1:00:04] no two thousand years ago
[1:00:08] now
[1:00:10] had two thousand years ago not taken
[1:00:12] place
[1:00:15] there would have been no
[1:00:20] writing about
[1:00:23] that he was explained before the
[1:00:24] foundational world
[1:00:29] see before the foundation of the world
[1:00:32] there was no plan to save you
[1:00:34] now i hope you understand me
[1:00:37] because even once man sinned
[1:00:40] those old testament saints could not
[1:00:41] come into the redemptive form
[1:00:44] of the new birth
[1:00:47] so thereby there was no way to make the
[1:00:50] full plan of god effective in the old
[1:00:52] testament
[1:00:56] would have to come to the new testament
[1:00:58] to be able to bring it out
[1:01:02] now just remember he said brother dale
[1:01:04] you're only confusing me
[1:01:06] i'm not confusing you
[1:01:09] i'm exposing your confusion
[1:01:14] i'm just letting you know
[1:01:16] that you're confused
[1:01:18] right
[1:01:20] has any problem with that no
[1:01:22] well see i get blamed for confusing
[1:01:24] people
[1:01:25] i can't understand him he's so deep
[1:01:29] deep of what
[1:01:33] i just read what the prophet said
[1:01:36] amen amen
[1:01:38] yeah but you illustrated it well what
[1:01:40] are you going to do
[1:01:42] i'll give you a fulfill let you
[1:01:44] illustrate it
[1:01:48] see church
[1:01:49] we think we know what we're talking
[1:01:51] about
[1:01:53] i'm going to go ahead and put this in
[1:01:55] the reason we're here today 40-something
[1:01:57] years after the prophet was going
[1:02:00] is because of our mass confusion
[1:02:05] because of our organized religion
[1:02:11] remember we preached the message
[1:02:14] i didn't really realize it was going
[1:02:15] this way
[1:02:16] but i knew i'd hit it somewhere but
[1:02:18] that's all right and we emphasized a
[1:02:21] couple of messages that brother branham
[1:02:23] says on the feast of the trumpets that
[1:02:25] the holy ghost had been bound for two
[1:02:27] thousand years
[1:02:29] at the door of creeds and dogmas
[1:02:34] now if it's been bound 2 000 years you
[1:02:37] count on your finger
[1:02:40] it's only been 2 000 years since calvary
[1:02:46] right
[1:02:47] so the holy ghost was never loosed
[1:02:50] the way he wanted to you said well boy
[1:02:52] you're throwing off a great book about
[1:02:54] you've got all evening for us to go
[1:02:55] through the book of acts and see all of
[1:02:57] them denominational doctrines
[1:02:59] it was already in the book of acts
[1:03:02] philippus naiminius was teaching the
[1:03:04] resurrection was already pissed in the
[1:03:06] book of acts
[1:03:08] paul was having to rebuke peter
[1:03:11] in the book of acts
[1:03:16] right
[1:03:19] there was james trying to get everybody
[1:03:21] circumcised
[1:03:23] in the book of acts
[1:03:26] so the holy ghost has never been loosed
[1:03:28] but he said it would be loose by the
[1:03:30] end time
[1:03:32] message
[1:03:34] then said be loosed by the prophet
[1:03:37] be loosed by the end time message
[1:03:41] that he
[1:03:42] brought where is it going to be loosed
[1:03:44] at
[1:03:45] in you and me
[1:03:50] well brother dale it sure don't look
[1:03:51] like it because
[1:03:52] you know there was some of them saying a
[1:03:53] little bit about it last night you know
[1:03:55] bad times right
[1:03:57] i went out there i just couldn't help it
[1:03:58] i
[1:03:59] don't say too much
[1:04:03] so i just said well look
[1:04:05] the bible says when the enemy comes in
[1:04:07] like a flood the spirit of the lord will
[1:04:09] raise up a standard i see that's bible
[1:04:11] i'm happy to be here i'm glad we're in
[1:04:14] this bad economy
[1:04:18] you're glad
[1:04:19] yeah
[1:04:20] because it means god's here
[1:04:25] the church always will probably said
[1:04:26] done better under persecution we'll
[1:04:28] bring it on
[1:04:32] we've either get better or worse one
[1:04:36] that's right
[1:04:39] he said well why in the world all these
[1:04:40] things happening
[1:04:43] the bible said
[1:04:44] that's one army that i sent among you
[1:04:47] to try you
[1:04:49] can't come by or locust caterpillar read
[1:04:52] your message read the bible
[1:04:54] that wasn't god's army they didn't come
[1:04:56] from god he permitted it that's right
[1:05:00] to come among us to trust
[1:05:02] he said this bride would prove to satan
[1:05:05] that she wouldn't fall like eve
[1:05:09] all right bring it home
[1:05:12] you see yeah but you may be calling your
[1:05:14] own death
[1:05:15] well i hope for certainly one thing
[1:05:18] if they come and get me somebody will
[1:05:19] step up here and still
[1:05:21] tell you the truth amen
[1:05:24] i've never been concerned about that
[1:05:28] why because he can't get me until god
[1:05:30] gets through with me when he's too with
[1:05:32] me i need to get on out of the way
[1:05:36] maybe we'll get old enough one of these
[1:05:37] days we'll do that
[1:05:39] another 40 years
[1:05:45] and hear that did you honey here
[1:05:48] look at the next one
[1:05:51] my point is to get you to keep looking
[1:05:52] at that
[1:05:54] predestination
[1:05:57] looking back to foreknowledge
[1:06:00] but then for knowledge
[1:06:03] looking totally on to your destiny just
[1:06:06] going but back and totally back up price
[1:06:09] predestination
[1:06:15] this is from where i think pentecost
[1:06:17] failed 55 11 11
[1:06:19] um e 28. now the word is usually here in
[1:06:22] the fifth chapter predestination
[1:06:24] predestination is not a very good word
[1:06:26] for an evangelistic or minister to use
[1:06:29] because it kind of confuses people when
[1:06:31] you say predestination
[1:06:32] why does it confuse people for you to
[1:06:34] say predestination
[1:06:37] because they already got their ideas
[1:06:39] about what predestination is right
[1:06:42] it don't confuse anybody that doesn't
[1:06:44] already know what they think about it
[1:06:48] right
[1:06:51] i mean the first time i heard
[1:06:52] predestination didn't bother me
[1:06:54] at the baptist church
[1:06:57] that's so good that's for knowledge
[1:07:03] see i didn't have to correct all that
[1:07:04] when i come to message i could see it
[1:07:06] back there
[1:07:07] because i could read the bible
[1:07:12] some people don't like that though
[1:07:15] predestination speaks
[1:07:17] looks back to foreknowledge
[1:07:19] for knowledge looks to destination
[1:07:21] predestination goes back to
[1:07:23] foreknowledge
[1:07:26] so you see it
[1:07:28] i was saying it now i'm reading it
[1:07:31] okay
[1:07:33] for knowledge goes to destination
[1:07:36] in other words
[1:07:38] here is a prophet explaining what he
[1:07:41] says right
[1:07:43] in other words
[1:07:45] god didn't say
[1:07:47] now make this man to be this and i'll
[1:07:48] make this man to be that
[1:07:51] he didn't say that
[1:07:54] but in order to be god
[1:07:56] he had to know the end from the
[1:07:58] beginning
[1:08:00] so in order to foreknowledge that he
[1:08:02] knew
[1:08:03] he could say this would happen and that
[1:08:06] would happen because he was god and
[1:08:08] knowed where
[1:08:09] everything would be placed
[1:08:12] and therefore he could ordain certain
[1:08:14] things
[1:08:15] for certain ages
[1:08:18] you believe that that's fully scripture
[1:08:21] he ordained in the days of martin luther
[1:08:24] the message of the just shall live by
[1:08:26] faith
[1:08:32] by foreign
[1:08:33] we're going to get it in a second before
[1:08:35] knowledge he knew that message was
[1:08:37] following luther
[1:08:41] no not for the world he made luther
[1:08:44] no
[1:08:46] you done predetermined him too much
[1:08:52] get the story
[1:08:53] look at the next one
[1:08:55] the junction of time 1956
[1:08:58] e37
[1:09:00] did you ever read over there in romans 9
[1:09:02] how that he said
[1:09:04] before either boy was born he saw in
[1:09:06] jacob
[1:09:07] and said i hate one and love the other
[1:09:11] how can he be just and do that
[1:09:15] yeah that's what he said
[1:09:21] by four knowledge
[1:09:23] he knew what a rascal esau was
[1:09:28] and he could predestinate
[1:09:33] he could say that old boy's going to be
[1:09:34] a rascal
[1:09:37] why because he knew what he's going to
[1:09:39] do
[1:09:40] right
[1:09:43] now just say the word pretty it's not a
[1:09:45] good word to you it's for knowledge
[1:09:47] because he wouldn't just
[1:09:49] at deliberately turn you away
[1:09:53] because it's because you have
[1:09:55] he wants
[1:09:56] you to go
[1:09:58] he wants you to go away now he's not
[1:10:02] saying
[1:10:04] read it
[1:10:06] what i'm saying sometimes you read what
[1:10:08] brother brown said and you say well he
[1:10:10] said it
[1:10:12] he's not saying that he wants you to go
[1:10:13] away
[1:10:17] that's his point that his mind is moving
[1:10:19] backwards and forth like we all do
[1:10:22] see he wouldn't just
[1:10:24] deliberately turn you away
[1:10:26] because it's a because yeah
[1:10:28] he wants you to go away
[1:10:30] no he don't want you to go away
[1:10:33] why
[1:10:34] he's not willing that any of you should
[1:10:36] perish
[1:10:41] you see he's not saying it the way we
[1:10:44] they say just what he said
[1:10:48] you want to quote with me a little bit
[1:10:52] he said luther denominated and died and
[1:10:54] went to hell
[1:10:56] you need that quote
[1:11:03] he said you mean the prophet said that
[1:11:04] that's what he said
[1:11:07] but he ain't talking about luther right
[1:11:10] who's he talking about the lutherans
[1:11:12] who denominated and died
[1:11:16] well now you're putting well put yours
[1:11:18] to it
[1:11:20] you got yours on it
[1:11:24] he's not willing that any of you should
[1:11:26] perish
[1:11:27] but by foreknowledge he knows what
[1:11:29] you'll do
[1:11:30] even before you ever come on the earth
[1:11:34] sure for knowledge he's infinite he's
[1:11:36] god he's omnipotent
[1:11:38] i'm the president omniscient
[1:11:42] see he knows all things all wisdom and
[1:11:45] all time covered all's facing power he's
[1:11:48] infinite and if he isn't that he's not
[1:11:50] god
[1:11:53] if he is an almighty god he
[1:11:55] if he can't ju
[1:11:56] if he can't do all things he's not
[1:11:59] almighty god but if he's almighty god he
[1:12:02] can do all things see
[1:12:04] so that's the way we have to believe him
[1:12:08] all right
[1:12:11] he doesn't want anybody to be perished
[1:12:13] you know to purge or anything
[1:12:19] so then
[1:12:21] we'll we'll
[1:12:22] probably cut here
[1:12:24] and continue this wednesday
[1:12:27] all right with a lot of the quotes
[1:12:30] but i want you to get the point
[1:12:33] because the point is what i'm after for
[1:12:34] you to get what i'm talking about
[1:12:40] predestination
[1:12:42] is a destiny determined beforehand
[1:12:46] all right
[1:12:47] now
[1:12:49] foreknowledge
[1:12:52] is back before
[1:12:54] the predestination
[1:12:57] see we want to make him predetermined
[1:12:59] and then foreknowledge it
[1:13:01] no no we can't do it
[1:13:04] you're backing up predestination too far
[1:13:07] you're putting it predetermined
[1:13:09] without having full knowledge
[1:13:12] god by foreknowledge
[1:13:14] now i got a quote in here even the word
[1:13:15] wrote around said he knew where that
[1:13:17] spirit would fall
[1:13:20] like the little woman at the well he
[1:13:22] said how could that predestinated seed
[1:13:26] work out into that person
[1:13:30] brother you believe in a predestinated
[1:13:32] seed i sure do
[1:13:36] if you don't you got a problem
[1:13:39] a predetermined seed yeah
[1:13:42] we'll get down to
[1:13:44] that but i want you to get to mine thing
[1:13:48] how does he predestinate
[1:13:53] by his foreknowledge
[1:13:58] then he knew before the world begun
[1:14:03] who would be saved and who wouldn't be
[1:14:04] saved even though we had not even come
[1:14:07] into being as a spirit or being or
[1:14:09] anything
[1:14:14] he had those attributes in him to be
[1:14:16] savior healer etc
[1:14:19] so he would have to predestinate the
[1:14:21] prophet said somebody to be lost right
[1:14:26] right
[1:14:27] great brother don't mind saying it like
[1:14:29] that
[1:14:31] in order to be god he'd have to
[1:14:33] predestinate
[1:14:34] somebody to be lost
[1:14:38] well that means he's making them be lost
[1:14:40] without giving him a choice no
[1:14:42] because we've done backed up to four
[1:14:44] knowledge
[1:14:48] see as long as you keep it in four
[1:14:50] knowledge
[1:14:52] you can let him set back before the
[1:14:54] world
[1:14:56] when he wasn't even god because god is
[1:14:58] an object of worship and it wasn't
[1:15:00] anything to worship him
[1:15:03] and you could see him sitting there
[1:15:06] knowing
[1:15:07] that when he made the world what we
[1:15:10] would do
[1:15:13] he know jacob
[1:15:16] would want that birthright
[1:15:23] now honestly
[1:15:25] what don't you think
[1:15:28] in the illustration of jacob
[1:15:31] we know what that types
[1:15:34] but you know jacob didn't give a hoot
[1:15:36] about heaven
[1:15:43] you mean the birthright to jacob was
[1:15:44] going to make him go to heaven
[1:15:48] no the verse right to jacob was going to
[1:15:49] make him rich on earth
[1:15:54] that types
[1:15:56] the point of you and i
[1:16:01] see we take it and we say look at that
[1:16:03] jacob wanted this esau didn't want it
[1:16:07] we want to try to make it some salvation
[1:16:12] when jacob was just concerned with
[1:16:14] getting that
[1:16:15] natural birthright
[1:16:17] because my understanding of it was a
[1:16:19] double portion
[1:16:20] because remember esau got a blessing too
[1:16:23] he saw that a lot too you know
[1:16:26] but it was a double blessing
[1:16:28] double portion
[1:16:30] to the one with the birthright
[1:16:32] jacob wouldn't talk about going to
[1:16:34] heaven
[1:16:37] he's wanting all his sheeps and goats
[1:16:39] and
[1:16:40] and land
[1:16:44] and to be able to rule over his brother
[1:16:47] you know he's still a shyster
[1:16:53] but yet he had a
[1:16:54] desire about that birthright
[1:16:58] that would mean somebody would come down
[1:17:00] here see and have a desire about the
[1:17:02] birthright of the baptism of the holy
[1:17:04] ghost jacob wasn't talking about the
[1:17:05] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:17:07] amen
[1:17:10] he was talking about natural properties
[1:17:12] and natural things
[1:17:15] that would speak of what you and i
[1:17:16] desire
[1:17:18] all right
[1:17:20] now then
[1:17:21] god would look down
[1:17:24] and he could see that jacob would be the
[1:17:26] way he was and he sort of be the way he
[1:17:28] was so before the world he could go
[1:17:30] ahead and predetermine it that's right
[1:17:33] not now here's where we got to get it
[1:17:36] not that he
[1:17:38] took these two
[1:17:40] put them in a position and made them do
[1:17:42] what they'd done
[1:17:47] come on
[1:17:48] he didn't make jacob be there he didn't
[1:17:50] bake he saw me there
[1:17:54] if he did he's guilty
[1:17:56] right that's right
[1:17:59] he's guilty of a
[1:18:00] being a
[1:18:02] respecter of persons
[1:18:04] see that's where the people in the
[1:18:06] message they like to get it all make you
[1:18:07] just feel so good and you just shout oh
[1:18:10] it's in case you just see this together
[1:18:12] he was born with that seed down in there
[1:18:14] and in case you just see that seed down
[1:18:16] in there
[1:18:19] oh i just feel like it's something yep
[1:18:21] napoleon did too
[1:18:23] you remember that guy you know napoleon
[1:18:27] thought he was uh
[1:18:29] come down from some other
[1:18:31] you know he's been here before you know
[1:18:34] maybe you don't even study your history
[1:18:35] with all that
[1:18:39] but listen
[1:18:42] if god picked one over the other
[1:18:48] as a priority or a specialty
[1:18:51] or because he liked one better than the
[1:18:53] other one
[1:18:55] he can't judge us for being sinners then
[1:19:01] we'll see i can see them on computers
[1:19:03] ron see people in their mind they just
[1:19:05] run them
[1:19:07] the bible said he know good and evil
[1:19:11] he said he created good and evil
[1:19:15] now how could a eternal god create evil
[1:19:23] if he created evil he can't judge evil
[1:19:26] for being evil
[1:19:28] he knowed
[1:19:30] when he created it it would be
[1:19:34] evil not that he created it wrong
[1:19:39] see we've got all of that we think we
[1:19:40] know
[1:19:42] i'm sorry
[1:19:43] it's like i said i don't preach to try
[1:19:45] to tear you up i preach to try to
[1:19:47] straighten us all up
[1:19:49] get us to think yes
[1:19:54] but brother dale you just don't believe
[1:19:56] that there was a predestinated seed up
[1:19:58] in heaven
[1:20:03] i've done preached on it to you and i'll
[1:20:04] get back to it maybe some of you didn't
[1:20:08] catch then and then maybe you slept a
[1:20:09] little so we'll get back to sometimes
[1:20:15] what happened before the world ever
[1:20:16] begun
[1:20:19] i like what the old black brother said
[1:20:20] about that don't you
[1:20:22] you remember the first one brother brown
[1:20:23] heard
[1:20:25] the old guy with a little rim i heard an
[1:20:26] old man with the old wolf coat and led
[1:20:28] him up to the pulpits
[1:20:30] brother and said he took his text on
[1:20:32] what happened in glory
[1:20:36] and brought it down to earth he said
[1:20:38] everybody else was dealing with what was
[1:20:39] on earth
[1:20:41] i'd love to heard that old man preach
[1:20:47] god if you know what you're doing you
[1:20:48] could rejoice with him
[1:20:52] but do you understand what i'm saying
[1:20:56] brother dale he made me wrong
[1:20:58] he didn't make you wrong
[1:21:04] he gave you a choice
[1:21:08] ever even it doesn't matter after the
[1:21:10] fall or whatever every baby is born with
[1:21:13] a choice that's why you have an age of
[1:21:15] accountability
[1:21:17] right because that's when the person
[1:21:19] starts making their choice
[1:21:22] now i can't help it he put me he didn't
[1:21:25] put you in the pawn shop i preached a
[1:21:27] couple of messages about 10 years ago on
[1:21:29] that
[1:21:31] he didn't put you brother dick in the
[1:21:32] pawn shop
[1:21:33] you put yourself in there
[1:21:38] you started sinning and that puts you in
[1:21:40] the pawnshop god didn't make you go to
[1:21:43] the pawn shop
[1:21:44] see we saw oh he put me in the pawn shop
[1:21:46] i can't have it no he didn't put me
[1:21:48] there i put my own self there
[1:21:53] by the choices i made in life
[1:21:58] but you see what i'm talking about yes
[1:22:01] foreknowledge is the greatest thing that
[1:22:03] we could ever think of
[1:22:07] and why's the doctrine always been about
[1:22:08] predestination
[1:22:10] right
[1:22:12] have you ever heard anybody preach their
[1:22:14] doctrine of foreknowledge
[1:22:15] no they preach on predestination
[1:22:19] before knowledge is before
[1:22:20] predestination
[1:22:22] i just got through an hour and i have
[1:22:24] proven it to you
[1:22:29] right
[1:22:31] then why couldn't it be that god before
[1:22:33] the world
[1:22:35] that he knew when he made us
[1:22:38] that we'd fall
[1:22:40] but he didn't make us fall
[1:22:42] he just made eve with the ability to
[1:22:46] and you know adam could have still
[1:22:47] backed up and said no way
[1:22:51] no way
[1:22:53] make me another one i'm losing ribs but
[1:22:56] get me some more
[1:23:01] but he didn't do it
[1:23:04] god knew adam was going to do what he
[1:23:06] done
[1:23:10] like my mother said my daddy she's
[1:23:11] talking to him on predestination
[1:23:13] and said they're speaking cotton then my
[1:23:15] daddy said i don't believe that
[1:23:17] predestination you know
[1:23:19] she said i believe you know she told i
[1:23:20] believe god you know predestination no
[1:23:23] he said does god know i'm gonna pick up
[1:23:24] bowl of cotton she said yeah you know he
[1:23:26] said okay i'm going around it
[1:23:29] see i thought he pulled something over
[1:23:30] on him
[1:23:31] he just went around the bowl of cotton
[1:23:32] left hand how many did that change god
[1:23:37] no
[1:23:38] just left a bowl of cotton
[1:23:41] but you see church
[1:23:44] why is everybody dealing with
[1:23:45] predestination
[1:23:47] and nobody's dealing before knowledge
[1:23:53] amen
[1:23:54] god before the world stood as a lamb
[1:23:57] slain jesus christ
[1:24:00] and all names was written in the book
[1:24:02] lounge book of life before the
[1:24:03] foundation world that's right
[1:24:07] because god foreknew
[1:24:11] those who he foreknew
[1:24:14] we're gonna get down to some scriptures
[1:24:15] what does it say
[1:24:17] those who he foreknew
[1:24:19] he did predestinate
[1:24:23] it doesn't say those he predestinated
[1:24:26] one day he's going to know about him
[1:24:33] listen folks
[1:24:34] i'll end it
[1:24:37] by saying it this way
[1:24:41] we brother tom had a good point years
[1:24:43] ago
[1:24:44] he used a little odd way of saying it
[1:24:46] he said brother dale i see it he said we
[1:24:49] trigger our predestination
[1:24:52] i said that's a good way of saying it
[1:24:54] you know
[1:24:57] see we were the ones that made the
[1:24:59] choice
[1:25:03] god didn't make me make the choice
[1:25:07] but you just laid it down in front of me
[1:25:12] he's ah i just can't see it that way
[1:25:13] don't brother there because there's paul
[1:25:15] doing everything he's doing wrong and
[1:25:16] god just dropped down and saved him it
[1:25:18] didn't matter what
[1:25:24] you mean the guy that's explaining poor
[1:25:27] knowledge and predestination
[1:25:29] right
[1:25:30] nobody else explained it right that's
[1:25:32] right i mean none of the others use it
[1:25:34] for knowledge predestination in the
[1:25:36] writings you know all together
[1:25:38] and he is the one that you would think
[1:25:40] that god said i'm going to save him it
[1:25:42] don't make no difference
[1:25:47] he just knew how to get his attention
[1:25:51] so he slapped him off the horse
[1:25:55] but that wasn't the first attention
[1:25:56] that's all we know
[1:25:58] that wasn't the first attention god got
[1:26:00] him paul
[1:26:03] when he saw stephen
[1:26:06] being stoned to death
[1:26:09] and seeing stephen saying lord forgive
[1:26:11] them
[1:26:14] but around said that bore on his mind
[1:26:17] and he said
[1:26:18] he wanted
[1:26:19] to die
[1:26:23] because of what he'd done
[1:26:26] but we think he was just on the road to
[1:26:28] damascus got knocked down by great
[1:26:29] bright light and this all happened
[1:26:31] that's catholic doctrine
[1:26:33] catholic doctrine is that you ordered
[1:26:35] make people be saved whether they want
[1:26:36] to be saved or not and they say look at
[1:26:38] paul he was there and they god smote him
[1:26:41] down and made him get saved
[1:26:43] he didn't make him get saved
[1:26:46] smiting paul to knocking him down didn't
[1:26:48] give him the holy ghost
[1:26:52] come on
[1:26:57] he didn't get the holy ghost because he
[1:26:59] slapped him off the horse
[1:27:04] why would he send
[1:27:05] what ananias
[1:27:08] he sent him down there he said you go
[1:27:09] down there
[1:27:12] paul gets up and he gets baptized and
[1:27:13] then and i says
[1:27:15] god's going to show you what you're
[1:27:16] going to go through with
[1:27:20] he's going to send you to the gentiles
[1:27:25] paul gets the new birth and he's ready
[1:27:27] to go
[1:27:31] see we want to make predestination a
[1:27:32] great thing why not back up to full
[1:27:34] knowledge
[1:27:37] well brother around and we'll say it
[1:27:38] we'll get to it he said if you wasn't in
[1:27:40] that word a part of that word before the
[1:27:42] world you never will be
[1:27:46] he said if you wasn't in the mind of god
[1:27:49] you never will be
[1:27:52] well judas was in the mind of god every
[1:27:54] person in the world is in the mind of
[1:27:55] god
[1:27:59] but the mind of god knew that jacob
[1:28:01] would want that birthright
[1:28:04] and that esau
[1:28:06] would reject it
[1:28:10] he knows exactly what our choices we
[1:28:12] make
[1:28:12] and we can't blame him for anything
[1:28:14] blame your choices brother done a good
[1:28:16] job life's not talking about that the
[1:28:18] choices we make
[1:28:20] in life
[1:28:22] we choose the wife we marry you know the
[1:28:24] work we do the line of work whatever we
[1:28:26] do we choose everybody left
[1:28:29] then we turn around and say lord he was
[1:28:30] the woman you gave me
[1:28:34] he said i didn't give her to you
[1:28:36] you went and got her
[1:28:38] put up with it
[1:28:40] right
[1:28:48] moses it was japora
[1:28:50] he said
[1:28:52] you got sephora and you live with her oh
[1:28:55] boy
[1:28:59] look around said there was some mighty
[1:29:00] hot-headed fights going on out right on
[1:29:02] the backside of that desert
[1:29:07] and then she comes up there one day and
[1:29:08] saves his life because she's hot-headed
[1:29:11] because god was fixing to kill that
[1:29:13] prophet
[1:29:15] right
[1:29:16] and zepora grabbed a baby and
[1:29:18] circumcised it
[1:29:19] said daughter bloody husband
[1:29:23] hasn't been for her he'd been dead
[1:29:26] see we don't cover
[1:29:28] for knowledge we cover pre-determining
[1:29:38] one day we will get to a predetermined
[1:29:41] to understand that there was a seed of
[1:29:43] god yes
[1:29:46] brother brown said you come to that seed
[1:29:48] in you
[1:29:50] but what did he say that seed was
[1:29:57] come on
[1:29:59] he said it was representation and i'm
[1:30:01] quoting him from predestination
[1:30:04] he said it was representation of
[1:30:06] predestination those are laying on the
[1:30:08] desk at the house so
[1:30:10] somebody out there just listen a little
[1:30:12] while we'll get out to it
[1:30:17] but you see church then i can take
[1:30:19] everything right around save and i don't
[1:30:20] have to back up
[1:30:22] i believe in a
[1:30:24] predestinated seed
[1:30:26] amen
[1:30:31] but i also believe there's one quote in
[1:30:33] here i also believe that brother ryan
[1:30:35] said
[1:30:36] every person
[1:30:37] in the world
[1:30:39] every person he says
[1:30:42] was born
[1:30:43] with this desire in them to serve god
[1:30:48] sure does away with serpent seed don't
[1:30:52] but yet in the message see if you happen
[1:30:54] to be
[1:30:55] born of adam you can be saved but if
[1:30:57] you're born of the beast and eve you
[1:30:59] can't be saved well what are you going
[1:31:02] to do with jacob and esau coming from
[1:31:04] the same mother
[1:31:07] and the same daddy
[1:31:13] but yet i'm not popular because i tell
[1:31:15] it too straight
[1:31:17] everybody wants to feel good
[1:31:20] well i can get some ice and make you
[1:31:21] chill pumps if you want it
[1:31:23] we try to turn the thermostat down and
[1:31:25] everybody gets cold
[1:31:29] someone glory in the fact that we don't
[1:31:30] turn it down someone glory in the fact
[1:31:32] that we do and
[1:31:35] you'll never satisfy everybody
[1:31:39] like sister gayle said years ago she
[1:31:40] said get all them women going through
[1:31:42] the change of life and said you got
[1:31:43] problems
[1:31:46] well
[1:31:48] but you know what we don't have no
[1:31:49] problems
[1:31:53] i believe
[1:31:56] in predestination
[1:31:58] i believe by foreknowledge god knew
[1:32:00] every person that would be sitting here
[1:32:02] today
[1:32:04] but he knew who wouldn't be here
[1:32:08] and he knows why they're not here
[1:32:16] you see i get up every day believing in
[1:32:17] the foreknowledge of god
[1:32:19] but you know my foreknowledge is a
[1:32:21] little different than everybody else i
[1:32:22] guess
[1:32:23] i don't get up and say well what's
[1:32:25] predetermined to happen today what's
[1:32:26] presbyterian well i fell off that so
[1:32:28] that's over with i'm glad i got that
[1:32:30] done
[1:32:30] that was predestination and presbyterian
[1:32:33] i don't believe that
[1:32:35] i believe i'm walking around looking in
[1:32:37] and saying huh don't step down and go
[1:32:38] down this way
[1:32:42] god for knew i'd have enough sense to be
[1:32:44] able to use my brain
[1:32:46] to keep me from falling off of that
[1:32:49] foreknowledge is very simple
[1:32:56] has any of you ever had
[1:32:59] a vision
[1:33:00] or a dream
[1:33:03] of a future event
[1:33:08] a future something's going to happen
[1:33:09] later
[1:33:11] see a lot of people has never had that
[1:33:16] but if you ever have it you'll
[1:33:19] figure out god does know things you know
[1:33:24] he knows something's going to take place
[1:33:28] and he can say okay that's it
[1:33:32] it's going to be that way
[1:33:35] my wife and i were up in the garden one
[1:33:36] day was doing something picking beans or
[1:33:38] doing something i told her something's
[1:33:40] gonna happen i said if it don't happen i
[1:33:41] won't preach anymore.
[1:33:42] she said well you preached your life
[1:33:44] sermon what she was she was as honest as
[1:33:46] could be i mean
[1:33:47] when i was a teller it was impossible
[1:33:51] but i'm still preaching
[1:33:57] see if you ever have something to where
[1:33:58] you know where you're at
[1:34:02] you know god's foreknowledge is working
[1:34:04] because he's done shoji
[1:34:09] he showed that prophet a bride standing
[1:34:11] there
[1:34:12] dressed
[1:34:14] he saw that in the back parts so some of
[1:34:17] them was weaving in and out and wouldn't
[1:34:19] straighten up and i believe that's kind
[1:34:20] of where we're at
[1:34:22] and
[1:34:23] but you know what he showed him a bride
[1:34:29] well you come along and say well brother
[1:34:30] branham don't i don't believe it could
[1:34:32] be that way well you know what i might
[1:34:33] have messed up
[1:34:36] i don't think you could have convinced
[1:34:37] him
[1:34:40] i've had two or three incidents where
[1:34:41] i've seen it before
[1:34:43] and
[1:34:44] there's no way to tell me if the lord
[1:34:45] shows me that there's no way to tell me
[1:34:47] that it's not going to be that way
[1:34:52] i mean you're just wasting your breath
[1:34:57] why because i've already seen it that's
[1:35:00] full knowledge
[1:35:02] that's what god done before the world
[1:35:05] he looked down through time and saw
[1:35:06] everybody
[1:35:08] he knew who would want to be saved and
[1:35:11] who wouldn't want to be saved
[1:35:17] but he didn't go down through there i
[1:35:19] picked this one and i'll pick that one
[1:35:21] i'll leave that one
[1:35:22] i think now right
[1:35:27] by his foreknowledge
[1:35:28] he knew
[1:35:30] what you'd want
[1:35:33] i love him for that
[1:35:35] you know why because that makes me with
[1:35:36] a choice
[1:35:40] understand that makes me with a choice
[1:35:43] come on musicians
[1:35:46] foreknowledge
[1:35:48] how does god predestinate my
[1:35:50] foreknowledge
[1:35:53] which comes first
[1:35:55] predestination or foreknowledge for
[1:35:58] knowledge comes before predestination
[1:36:03] and for knowledge he can look all away
[1:36:06] and see the total end of the destiny
[1:36:14] was it not even job
[1:36:18] that when he saw it he said
[1:36:20] i know my redeemer amen
[1:36:26] he said i know i'm going through this
[1:36:28] but i'll come forth
[1:36:32] well
[1:36:35] because he had god's foreknowledge given
[1:36:37] unto him
[1:36:42] there is a predetermined word
[1:36:45] that falls in every age
[1:36:49] but there's a four knowledge people who
[1:36:51] received that word
[1:36:54] and walked there in
[1:36:59] what do we think about it what do we got
[1:37:00] brother
[1:37:01] oh we're going to do 523 in the spiral
[1:37:04] book
[1:37:18] up there i don't know where they can or
[1:37:20] not they're going to cry
[1:37:23] of course i got them up here
[1:37:27] i guess let's do it
[1:37:29] and put them up there first time
[1:37:32] we're going
[1:37:45] it's later than you think
[1:37:50] the pride is prepared
[1:37:54] for our lord
[1:38:00] all things
[1:38:11] is
[1:38:27] a people who
[1:38:42] is
[1:39:10] anybody
[1:39:20] you know what that combine is
[1:39:28] you really know what that combine is
[1:39:32] that's the world council of church
[1:39:35] what your prophet said
[1:39:38] don't you go out there in the field
[1:39:39] right now and you watch it
[1:39:42] they got a combine that's going forward
[1:39:46] that combine is taking the wheat
[1:39:49] putting it into a special place
[1:39:51] just cutting that stalks down it's
[1:39:53] binding them
[1:39:56] and sending that chap out into the field
[1:40:01] do you really want that
[1:40:03] combine to become it
[1:40:19] water
[1:40:20] valley you have a
[1:40:23] need for knowledge
[1:40:37] and god don't make anything happen
[1:40:44] but he knew it would
[1:40:49] why couldn't he send brother branham
[1:40:50] another way instead of facing that car
[1:40:52] out there in
[1:40:54] texas
[1:40:56] what about it
[1:41:02] very easy to see him down another road
[1:41:09] but when time and eternity met
[1:41:14] there was no choice for it to be no
[1:41:15] other way
[1:41:18] because that was the end of god's
[1:41:19] thought
[1:41:22] what about us
[1:41:35] father we know our brother got hurt the
[1:41:37] other day there and it
[1:41:40] because these problems and things to
[1:41:42] happen in the body
[1:41:44] now we just ask you to come down and
[1:41:46] take them away
[1:41:47] just let your love be made manifest
[1:41:50] you knew before the world ever begun it
[1:41:52] our brother would get hurt
[1:41:54] but you knew he'd be standing here today
[1:41:56] to be able to ask
[1:41:59] you knew that by your stripes
[1:42:01] he's healed
[1:42:03] and we thank you in jesus name
[1:42:06] anybody else
[1:42:09] it's later than you think
[1:42:25] a
[1:42:48] right
[1:42:59] you know i ran across a
[1:43:01] quote one time that of course all of it
[1:43:03] does but
[1:43:04] it thrilled me one day to read
[1:43:08] because we always thought about god
[1:43:09] being impersonal where they stayed up in
[1:43:11] heaven you know and off
[1:43:13] but brother brown said even after the
[1:43:14] fall
[1:43:16] and said with israel being at all that
[1:43:18] they were doing and all of their
[1:43:20] wrongs and everything
[1:43:22] he said god came down
[1:43:25] and busied himself
[1:43:27] with the people
[1:43:31] even though they're doing all the wrong
[1:43:33] they were doing he was still right there
[1:43:35] leading them
[1:43:36] home
[1:43:38] that's a great god
[1:43:41] why didn't he just say i know what's
[1:43:42] going to happen i'm going back up wait
[1:43:43] in heaven
[1:43:46] that's a good predestination doctor
[1:43:50] no but by knowledge he knew he needed to
[1:43:52] be there
[1:43:57] predestination would let him know where
[1:44:00] everything was gonna be that's fine
[1:44:03] but he wanted to be there
[1:44:07] don't you love him
[1:44:09] don't you love him for the word that
[1:44:11] he's given us
[1:44:13] the day and the hour that we're living
[1:44:14] to where we can understand
[1:44:16] father we thank you lord for your love
[1:44:19] this day we thank you for calvary
[1:44:21] thank you for all the things
[1:44:23] thank you for revealing that word unto
[1:44:25] us that we may walk durian and we pray
[1:44:27] now that you just help us as we come to
[1:44:29] an end of the service now and
[1:44:31] the people travel on the way home in may
[1:44:33] lord
[1:44:34] you take care of everybody you give
[1:44:36] everybody a safe journey
[1:44:38] and father
[1:44:39] we believe
[1:44:41] that even prayer can change things
[1:44:44] so if it's already dead set
[1:44:47] as we're taught
[1:44:49] how could prayer change
[1:44:53] the mind of a god
[1:44:56] until he would do other things
[1:44:59] but then he would know that we would be
[1:45:00] there to do that to start with and ask
[1:45:02] for that
[1:45:04] so it's just doing what you said you'd
[1:45:06] do
[1:45:07] i'll be with you alway
[1:45:09] even to the end of the world we love you
[1:45:11] and we thank you and we commit it now to
[1:45:12] you in jesus name
[1:45:14] amen you're dismissed
[1:45:35] moment
[1:45:56] you
