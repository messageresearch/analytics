TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the screen today I thought this morning we'd do something just kind of we're on godliness and take your Bibles and turn to Galatians chapter 5 and Galatians chapter 5 we're going to read Paul's writings this morning and let him kind of explain it's talking about the fruits of the spirit obviously but it also talks about other things also that U that when we get to Godliness that's a that's a beautiful position to be in um that you can act like God so that what that's what godliness is right is to act like God now we still have the human factor that we have to deal with because of the sin curse but now if he made a way if he made a way to get out of it then there's a way to get out of it that is dealing with the flesh there's a way to get out of that because he conquered the flesh when he was here right so and The Same Spirit that's in him within us is in us if we have any bir and just common sense would say it should make exact same way right all right so Galatians chap CH 5 we're going to read the whole chapter but when we get down to the fruits of the spirit we'll talk about that because I believe this kind of sums it all up that you can take each one and parallel them with all the virtues but when you come to Godliness is what I said before when you get to Godliness you got all those virtues working in your life then then there's a lot of things that you should be able to do to overcome at that place so let's go to chapter five Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty where with Christ has made us free now he's talking about the New Birth we come to the New Birth and be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage don't be entangled again so what can happen you can get entangled you know what he saying don't be entangled again with the Yoke of bondage all right which who puts the Yoke on us we do cuz Christ took it off we put the burdens back on right right behold I Paul say unto you that if you be circumcised Christ shall profit you nothing boy he was telling them plain wasn't he I mean he he he's talking to the Galatians he's telling them said your circumcision is nothing now it's a circumcision of the heart not a circumcision of the flesh right but there was a time when we come up to the circumcision of the flesh which was a type and that's it un new birth that's the baby form when Abraham was circumcised that type the Holy Ghost in its baby form everybody got that right all right but we have to be circumcised again have to be circumcised again cuz it's it's a refilling of the Holy Ghost it's not you get the Holy Ghost like you did at the baby form right it's a refilling it's a packing on of more because really actually I was I was listening the other day on a radio and there was a doctor on there and he said he you know your largest organ in your body you know what the largest organ in your body is organism in your body is skin your skin right your flesh your flesh is the largest organism in your body it covers Almost 100% besides all them little places that there's not flesh there you know you understand what I'm talking about so Paul understood that that great you know the greatest organ was going to have to be circumcised not totally circumcised like Abraham did with the foreskin of his of his manhood but but it's the foreskin of our flesh it's the it's the added stuff that we have that we have to shave off that's why the statue of perfect man is a shaving off of excess flesh and it's not excess flesh we can't do anything you know you could lose 100 lb but you you still a center if you were a center you know whatever so it's not that it's it's working on the inside but it truly is showing on this one if this is your largest organ your larest facility to display Humanity this is what has got to be under control all right watch what he says for I testify again to every man that is circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law right now do you understand what he's saying there not see a lot of people say well I'm just going to go to the priest and let him cut the four skin of my manhood off and I'm well sure that made you a Jew and that gave you right to go in the temple because you were circumcised but that was just an outward showing that's why there was no holy ghost in the Old Testament to get inside the person it was just a fleshly looking at the person you know but here we see Paul has brought us into the into the light of of the whole law in other words what you know what he was seeing he was seeing people go and have the circumcision done and then living like the devil that's what he was seeing right here cuz he says not try testify again to every man that is circumcised that he is a Deb to do the whole law not just that one type of circumcision right so so we're and let me explain this a little bit quicker our foreskins taking off at a new birth all right that's the type but then here we got to be a debor of the whole law we say well we're not under the law no we're not but you can't do away with the Old Testament types and shadows which brings us into the new testament which brings that statute of a perfect man alive in Jesus Christ and in now in me and you so the ones before that I don't say they have an excuse but they do have an excuse God couldn't get in their soul to make them act like him but there was anointing that would come down and and anoint the person David right and he would write those songs as we're talking about but when that anointing was off David he was a a lustful king sorry he was a lustful King m i mean man he had 500 wives he had 500 wives but he want he he watched one on the rooftop naked and got all excited let me just just I mean and said I want her knowing she was married cuz you I was his best friend now see that wasn't the holy ghost that was that was this flesh that Paul St F talk about right that was the flesh he's fixing to talk about now I'm sure David was circumcised right I'm sure don't you think so he had the right of circumcision he was under the law he was under the the right of being a Jew or an Israelite but he didn't do the whole law but remember he was covered by grapes by Prophet being them right it's not for Grace then we're all you can be circumcised you you you can take a grinder and grind your flesh off and you still just as bad as you you know that's right right that's right all that people today back then they said I'm circumcised so I got to be God today I'm in the got right but do you do the whole law all 1100 sermon do we do what the prophet said right Christ is become of no effect unto you whosoever of you are justified by the law the law can't justify anybody so that's why I'm telling you about this virtue not all that is not dos and don'ts right there's not a do and a don't in that that's right but it's all dos and don'ts it's what you do and what you don't do but remember what Paul's trying to tell the Galatians he's like Mom said he's looking at them and saying okay you're circumcised you can go into the temple you you can show me in other words I can show you I've been circumcised that was an outward expression that they had become a Jew but then you look at them and see him committing adultery you see them doing this you see him doing that you see him doing all these other things and Paul's going Christ has become of no effect unto you what he's trying to do is get them converted remember he said old fish Galatians he he went to the Galatians and and they uh still worshiping idols and stuff like that right ye are fallen from Grace so Paul was bringing Grace to him they thought Paul was bringing a judgment to him Paul was not he was trying he was trying to give him a way out he really was he was trying to say look you continue like you are you're going to have to stand in judgment under the wall and none of you are going to make it cuz it says right here it says you're fallen from grace for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith all right for in Jesus Christ neither circumcision ath anything nor uncircumcision but Faith which worketh by love you did run well who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth this persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you a little leaven leth the whole lung put a little bit of Leaven it don't matter if you put it in a 55 gallon drum of unleavened bread it's going to work and work and work work and work and what it does is it goes from uh it's like yeast it multiplies from one cell to two 2 to 4 4 to 8 8 to 16 16 to 32 so it's not just it's adding one it it's exponentially it's doubling that's right that's why the someone says sin will take you father than you want to go you know once you get out there I have confidence in you through the Lord that you will be none otherwise minded but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment who soever he be and I Brethren if I yet preach circumcision why do I yet suffer persecution remember he suffered persecution he wasn't s suffering persecution because he was circumcised cuz he could show him he was a Jew he was circumcised they were persecuting him by what he was preaching right he was tearing up their synagogues not physically but spiritually why do I yet suffer persecution then is the offense of the Cross ceased then is the offense of the Cross seed I would they were even cut off which trouble you for Brethren you have been called under Liberty only use not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serveth one another in other words don't do it because you say well I'm I'm coming to brotherly kindness I've got to start loving yeah you do yes you do have to start loving your brother but if you go well well I got to shake that sister's hand and smile at her just so they'll think I got brotherly kindness no they don't work right no that's why brotherly kindness we're going to get into a few things and it's going to I mean it's one of them where it's right here in your face it's right here it's just you and you alone cuz you can love somebody and shake their hand hug their neck and think to be friends with them and then they hate you in their heart and not that they hate you as you say well I hate you know whatever I you know I don't try not to hate things but I despise doing things it's not that you can't do that you got to bring that thing together cuz Jesus said the greatest commandment is love your neighbor as you love yourself now how many you had trouble with your neighbor well you got to love him and her just as much as you love yourself and everybody go do the will of the Lord we'll get to the more in a minute we got to do it the same okay but you know what that that works because when I was in New York and you said well I'm going to Che on I'm going to be kind I'm going do and I'm going smile and everything I used to sit in my manager's space and be smiling and smiling and smiling and smiling and I come home and I C myself I said you know God I did good the Holy Spirit wait this is good I was I was doing the FL and uh and you said you need your in Li the Holy Spirit bring to your attention is that you tell another a whole lot of lies smile his face tell a whole lot of lies he comes out and he he shows you brother talking about you showing it and he look at you and my manager even said oh John is so nice he I had it going on you a do didn't you there's one you can't do you can't can't do the Lord he's right there he knew it before the foundation of the world anyway for Brethren you have been called under Liberty only use not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serveth one another for all the law is fulfilled in one word even this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself but if you bite and devour one another take heed that you be not consumed one of another how many times you have listen we've all hated people that's done something to us or whatever and it just eats you alive you know what that ain't going to do you want any good you have wasted part of your life on somebody that don't give a flip about you that's right you wasted your time on it just don't don't worry about that's why why it's going to be tough when we get to brotherly kindness you know the old saying is that uh you know you walk around and you walk in a room and people's over there talking you know you think they're talking about you 90% of the time they ain't talking about you they're talking about their own problem right you know so that's what we got to and you know what it is an Alcoholics Anonymous to start with we've got to turn away from that to begin with and then God who was it the other day said they was doing something and like sister Johnny You' be going through life and you say well God I know I got got this road rage or whatever you know I got this thing that Satan just keep pushing my button well one day he's going to push that button and there's not going to be any life behind it or no spark behind it and you're going to go man that's gone that's done it's done away with but you know what you could sit there all day and go I know it's there but I'm going to still do it I know it's there but I'm going to still do it I know it's there see you can do that and you can override your free moral agency like we talking about last Sunday with the Holy Ghost you can override and the Holy Ghost says go this way and you go that way right we got going get finished yeah we will for all the law is fulfilled in one word all the law Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself but if you bite and devour one another take heed that you be not consumed one of another in other words so that's what I'm saying it's going to consume you it's going to hurt your Christian experience now how in the world world are you going to hurt that person's Christian experience if he's right if he don't have one if he don't have a Christian experience and you're over here n n n well who you hurting you ain't hurting him or her you hurt yourself all right that's something you got to get rid of this I say unto thee walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh now there's your promise right there you can Circle that one and underline it cuz that's yours I I had circled it but I underline it twice for the flesh lust is against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and they are contrary to one to the other now you got to realize that see we have to come to realization is is that that's why I believe this church is different from other churches a lot of other churches try to sugarcoat it and say well it's you know you got to just be be nice no we know we got problems in the flesh right right here that tells us there's no allevi of the problems of the flesh there's no way that that that that brother brandom or God even Jesus said well you're never going to have any trouble in the flesh anymore no it's never in the Bible nowhere the only place you're never going to have trouble with flesh is after the body change and I said after the body change I didn't say during it I said after it cuz brother R said right till the moment you're changeed you're going to be sticky your flesh is going to bother you right up to the moment of the change so there's no belief except through the spirit or through Jesus Christ walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh for if the flesh lusted against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these are contrary one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you would that's the statute of a perfect man because the Holy Ghost has all those virtues already packed in there when you get born again now what is our problem we do this right here we let the flesh not the not the listen when when it's talking about flesh it is talking about this but it's the fleshly things we do okay right because remember C taste feel smelling here there's no there's no uh life to that right you understand what I'm saying there's no life to seed taste feel smelling here cuz I still got the same seed taste feel smelling here when I wasn't born again as I do when I'm born again okay you know and remember when brother Brown went across a curtain of town they still had SE taste fil smelling here in their theophany right so so caste Phil smelling here you can't blame you cannot blame anything on caste fi smelling here right sure right so what are we doing it's got to be the next man memory reason CU like you brought out Wednesday night that's good I got a sermon on that I think I've been thinking on I've been thinking been thinking on it been thinking on it we'll say cuz really it is the spirit it now memory is a motivator right because what you saw you have memory of that's right so that's the seeing part but it wasn't that your eyes are going to memorize your eyes are just what you see it with your brain is where the memory part is your reasoning is in your brain your Consciousness yeah it is in your brain too because you have subconscious and Consciousness it's in your brain what brother brand said so all that's in your brain greatest battle ever fults what I was thinking about other night cuz memory reason conscious affection where does it come from your body just displays what you already know or what's chemically in your brain testosterone or whatever you want to call it m that excites you and then the flesh is connected to that and it happened memory reason conscious affection and Imagination for sure is in your brain right so it's all there in your brain it's all in the psyche of you is right there between your ears so it's not we can't blame on stuff well I saw this well no you look that way with your eyes but in your brain that's right in your brain is what motivate what you're looking at right okay so be careful with that middle man memory reason conscious affection imagination all right so let's watch because remember when it talks about Godly love it's not that affection that's in that middle realm the center realm is either Faith or doubt so you either got love or not love and that emulates out through the memory reason ious effects and Imagination it's like I've always said if God's in your soul the devil can play all around it that's right but he's coming from this way so he's got to come down through your contact of the world into your memory reason conscious affection well God's going to do the same thing he's pushing out sure there's no way you can physically forget the things you've done that's right cuz the devil is reminding you of everything you ever done now God's not reminding you of that now he may bring things to your remembrance so you can help others you understand what I'm saying to help others through a situation but he's not going to bring something that you did 20 years ago when you wasn't a Christian he's not going to bring that up you know why he can't remember it we got to realize that that's what that scripture means that he has put it in the sea of God's forgetfulness forgetfulness never to be remembered again but the devil see that's the Paradox the devil remembers it brings it to your brain God don't remember it and he's down here going this way and but you have to live off that experience that you have and that's what this statute of a perfect man to me is an experience right and it's an experience that only a very small group of people ever went through First Church age they had it second Church age they had a little bit less Third Church age a little bit less fourth Church age it was gone seed went the ground right fourth Church age they just had faith and that's what got them through they said Jesus Christ is the Son of God and he's my savior and they killed him and that's all they had then you had Luther come out Wesley come out Pentecostals came out but here in the end time that's why the prophet had to come to bring all this together so we can restore back that faith that they had where Peter could say Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I unto thee he had to have it to give it that's right he had to have it to give it and he didn't go ask his pastor about either we need a pastor bad but what about one day when you're out by yourself and you can't find your pastor better call Pastor Jesus that's right make sure you got a line open there somewhere okay but if you be led Verse 18 but if you be led of the spirit ye are not under the law all right now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath Strife sedition heresies envying murders drunkenness rep rebeling and such like and we've all done that one of them somewhere in there we've all done that okay and such like if you hadn't that covered you see what that says such like if you aen done any of them up above there Paul adds and such like so Paul was giving you no way out you know there probably somebody in the congregation is going no I didn't do that no I didn't do that no I ain't done that I ain't done that I ain't done that then he gets down Paul says and such like he says oh okay I did that of which I tell you before as I have also told you in times past so he's brought this up before that that okay to say he's brought this up before all right that ye which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God all right but you didn't leave it to that part but it did not it does not say the fruits of the spirit we say that wrong every time we say it it's not fruits right it's fruit of the spirit see it right there doesn't say fruits fruit of the spirit why because it's one fruit one spirit is coming from one place right love joy peace longsuffering see longsuffering can Co can cover patience gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law cuz the law just condemns you right the law just condemns you you're just doomed all right and they that are Christ have have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit let us not be desirous of vain Glory provoking one another envying one another so don't envy that brother Bob has got a meat spirit and you want one well it's good to have a meat Spirit but it's also good to be bold also good to be just just be who you are Paul said one time be content right be content with who you are you know and I like that what um what John the Baptist John the Baptist told those soldiers he said be content in your wages be content in what you do remember John said you be content with what you're doing you be content with what's going on okay now look let's read the first first few verses of chapter 6 cuz I'm like that Paul continues a thought they put chapters in here and all but I think Paul continued a letter he didn't write chapters he just wrote a letter he wrote a letter to the Galatians man took it and said okay he's talking about this over here so let's separate it and bring this down here but watch his thought just continue right on with chapter 6 there's no break there's no break in it Brethren if a man be overtaken in a fall now what are you just talking about the adulter perviousness and all that ye which are spiritual the ones that have love joy peace long suffering restore such and one in the spirit of meekness considering yourself lest thou also be tempted you see what he's saying cuz if you don't consider what you done right and say okay I'm going to bear with this brother you going to get a spirit on you like that brother's got it may not be as bad but still you got to be careful yes sir bear one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ now see that's not the law of man or the law of the Old Testament That's the Law of Christ for if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing he deceive himself but let every man prove his own work stop right there and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone and not in another this is a personal walk with God personal between you and him okay for every man shall bear his own burden every man shall bear his own burden so the burden of us is to have virtue the burden is to have that's our burden God don't have burden we have burden but remember he's the burden Bearer if you can't bear it anymore give it to him but he gives you a provision which is love joy peace long suffering and it's the fruit of the spirit so in other words my Longs sufferings got to be like brother Bob or brother Jo or somebody you can't say well I'm longsuffering and then you act another way and brother Joe says well I'm longsuffering and I act the way Christ sposed to act no there's one law there the law of Christ there's a fruit of the spirit which is love joy peace longsuffering to me that all binds up in godliness where we're at in a pyramid do anybody got any questions on godliness cuz we're going to start on brotherly kindness next next week Lord will it and uh cuz remember to be like God is to have a god Consciousness your first ious is I'm of the world the things of the world and all that but you're your your subconscious and that that inside of the inside has got to be more real than your outside person you understand me yes cuz that's the real you in here this remember this just displays what's in here right so you see taste feel smelling here you say well I saw that I heard that that's just to contact the world with that's just the that's just the conduit to get it to your brain in your brain is where you do the cooking the brain is where you cook things up or throw things out one of the two that's imagination you can sit there and imagine the people talking about you or you imagin or you can imagine that that you know this person that it all comes down to an individual affair with God that's right period amen you and God alone that's why I told them down in Miami I said look there's no preacher going to speak our body change they were a little silent but there's not they can't one person do it our brother Brandon would have to come back and one person would speak a body chain no it's got to come from what's inside of you right you'll speak your body change now we're not going to stand there one day I don't think and go today my body is going to be changed no I think we're going to walk in the word so much to where it's just going to take over amen and we're going to say this is it right we're done this is the finish this is the finish of it all we we've got the word that we need we' got the position that we're in now God it's up to you to change my body right and then you and then you'll be changed cuz I don't think we have to gather under a tent and one person speak our body change I I that's I don't I don't believe that amen because it's in an individual affair with God so but we will be changed at the same time right I believe I believe we will I think it's already been yes it has it had to be now we got to move into that we've got to believe that it's already it's like dad's preaching now we got to believe it's already been done right and it did start the day you got born again your change did begin Butz man it should have changed you right that's right it should have changed you there where the change starts amen but remember you still got that memory reason conscience affection imagination all that stuff bald around you that the devil shoot you with but just remember that godliness is to have a god Consciousness to act like not to act like God but act like Jesus which is God but remember you know you say well you need to act like Jesus Christ watch the money changers and watch the things he called hey he stood up congregation and called him hypocrite that's right Snakes in the Grass vipers you killed the CH you killed the prophets what stand up one day and say look just cuz you just cuz you you if you believe brother brandom a different way if you believe him uh that he's wrong I you've killed him right that's what he said that's what Jesus said about the prophets of old he said oh you just in other words you hold on to the books and the tapes and you shine the tombs but you're the ones that put him in there you're the on that put him in there that's right and we did we're the on to put him in the grave but we got to be the ones to bring him out right man all right let's go
