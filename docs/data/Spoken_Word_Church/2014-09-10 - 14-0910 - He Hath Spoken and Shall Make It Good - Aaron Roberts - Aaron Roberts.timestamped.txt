[6:07] it's one of those things where you

[6:11] and you don't know which direction to go
[6:12] so
[6:13] uh
[6:14] we're gonna
[6:15] we're gonna as brother branham said one
[6:17] time speaking about a dentist given a
[6:20] testimony he said lord just fill my
[6:22] mouth with good things and nudge me when
[6:24] i've said enough so
[6:26] that's what we believe in
[6:28] amen
[6:30] numbers chapter 23
[6:32] beginning of verse 13
[6:34] and it says and balak said unto him come
[6:37] i pray thee
[6:38] with me unto another place from whence
[6:40] thou may see them
[6:42] for
[6:43] thou shalt see but the
[6:45] utmost part of them and shall not see
[6:48] them all
[6:49] and curse
[6:51] me them from thence
[6:53] and he brought him into the field of
[6:55] zofin at the top of pisgah and built
[6:58] seven altars and offered a bullock and a
[7:00] ram on every altar and he said unto
[7:03] balak stand here
[7:04] at thy burnt offering while i meet the
[7:06] lord yonder and the lord met balaam and
[7:09] put a word in his mouth and said go
[7:11] again unto balak and save us
[7:13] and when he came to him behold he stood
[7:16] by his burning his burnt offering and
[7:18] the princes of moab with him and balak
[7:20] said unto him what hath the lord spoken
[7:24] and he took up his parable and said rise
[7:26] up balak and hear
[7:28] hearken unto me thou son of zippor
[7:31] god is not a man that he should lie
[7:32] neither the son of man that he should
[7:34] repent
[7:35] hath he said and shall he not do it
[7:39] or hath he spoken shall he not make it
[7:41] good
[7:42] behold i received commandment to bless
[7:45] and he hath blessed and i cannot reverse
[7:48] it he hath not beheld iniquity in jacob
[7:51] neither hath he seen perverseness in
[7:53] israel the lord his god is with him and
[7:56] the shout of a king is among them
[7:59] god brought them out of egypt he hath
[8:03] as it were the strength of a unicorn
[8:06] surely there is no enchantment against
[8:08] jacob neither
[8:10] there any divination against israel
[8:12] according to this time it shall
[8:15] be said of jacob and of israel what hath
[8:19] god wrought right amen god bless you may
[8:21] be seated
[8:22] lord bless the reading of the word
[8:25] yes
[8:29] this evening
[8:32] speaking
[8:33] tale of thought from verse 19
[8:36] and it says
[8:38] he said god is not a man that he should
[8:40] lie neither the son of man that he
[8:41] should repent
[8:43] hath he said and shall he not do it
[8:45] or hath he spoken and shall he not make
[8:47] it good
[8:50] and you know we know that god has spoken
[8:53] god has spoken and he will make it good
[8:56] and one of the things that
[8:59] you look at when you
[9:01] when you start looking at
[9:04] israel in their journey
[9:06] you know god brought him out of out of
[9:08] egypt
[9:09] and he's and he started them out and he
[9:11] promised them
[9:13] he said
[9:14] you know because he made a promise to
[9:16] abraham that that your seed would
[9:18] journey in a land but he said they would
[9:20] come out
[9:21] and you know he promised
[9:23] you know israel that they would come out
[9:26] and you know they they were down there
[9:28] suffering under the task masters but you
[9:30] know hey
[9:31] god in time brought them out
[9:33] because he promised the word to him and
[9:35] they and they came forth from eat from
[9:38] egypt
[9:39] and you know he started in the journey
[9:40] but then you know as soon as as soon as
[9:43] the joyous occasion of coming out
[9:46] wore off then they started to murmur and
[9:48] complain against god
[9:50] and you know it just started this this
[9:52] process of moses trying to
[9:54] carry the children of israel into the
[9:56] land and you know god was trying to show
[9:59] them and bring them to the place that he
[10:01] promised them and you know it was just a
[10:03] battle that moses had to go through the
[10:05] whole time but you they were coming
[10:07] through the through the land
[10:10] and you know god told them that when
[10:12] they when they come through these places
[10:14] god told them
[10:15] you may be going through this area but
[10:17] you're not of this place you're not of
[10:19] this land and that and they were
[10:21] supposed to stay separate from the
[10:23] people that they
[10:24] associated with because they were only
[10:26] passing through because just as we are
[10:29] we're just passing through you know
[10:31] we're we're not we're just pilgrim and
[10:33] strangers here we're just passing
[10:34] through this world because we have a
[10:36] better place to go to because we have a
[10:38] place that our builder and maker is god
[10:41] and we have a place that you know
[10:43] because we see the condition that the
[10:45] world is in today and you know
[10:47] you know i've gotten to the point now
[10:49] where you know it it gets tiresome just
[10:51] listening to the radio
[10:53] because you know it just becomes it's
[10:54] just the same thing over and over and
[10:57] over and everybody has the same same
[10:59] thing over and over and over it's just
[11:02] this group is trying to do this and this
[11:04] one's not doing anything and it's just
[11:06] you know just a continual just a mess
[11:10] and you just continue just you know
[11:12] after a while you listen to about five
[11:14] minutes of it and you got to turn it off
[11:15] because you can't handle any more
[11:17] because you know it's so bad but you
[11:19] know i'm so glad that i have that i've
[11:21] heard the good news
[11:22] because there's something that that
[11:24] because i know that one of these days
[11:27] that this body this mortal is going to
[11:29] take on immortality and it will be
[11:31] changed in a moment and tweaking it of
[11:32] an eye and then i'll be leaving here and
[11:35] then because god has promised me
[11:37] something that i that i can look forward
[11:40] to because i know and god has told us
[11:43] what these things are going to take
[11:45] place so when we see these things we're
[11:47] supposed to look up because our
[11:48] redemption draweth nigh because you know
[11:50] this is a rejoicing time but you know we
[11:53] see how these things are and they're
[11:54] supposed to continue to get worse and
[11:56] sometimes you wonder how in the world
[11:58] can it get worse well then you just look
[11:59] you just live a while and you just watch
[12:01] the news a little bit and you find out
[12:03] it does get worse
[12:04] but you know it's so thankful because we
[12:06] know that we're in this time but god is
[12:09] bringing a because when satan is on the
[12:12] move and he satan is doing all that he's
[12:14] going to do and he's fulfilling his plan
[12:16] then god's fulfilling his plan because
[12:18] he has a has a body because he said he
[12:20] would have a church he said he would
[12:22] have a bride without spot or wrinkle or
[12:24] any such blemish well you know what you
[12:26] and i are those people and you know
[12:28] whether we believe it or not you know
[12:30] what it has been spoken to you and he
[12:32] said he shall make it good he said has
[12:35] he not never said anything and shall he
[12:37] not do it
[12:38] well guess what he's going to do it
[12:41] well because there's somebody's going to
[12:42] fulfill that word that's going to be
[12:44] without spot without blemish without
[12:46] anything
[12:47] what is going to be perfect before him
[12:49] why because if you're looking at
[12:51] yourself yes you're going to have
[12:52] problems but you know what i'm looking
[12:54] at my sacrifice i'm looking at an
[12:56] atonement because that atonement covers
[12:58] me because he's got to look through the
[13:00] blood to see me
[13:04] and see
[13:05] god brother random said that grace he
[13:07] said grace provided for them in the
[13:09] journey he said it provided the the
[13:11] fiery serpent and when you when we go
[13:13] back you look at numbers chapter 21 and
[13:15] there when he starts talking about the
[13:17] journey you know here they are god's
[13:20] feeding them he said god gave him manna
[13:22] he fed him he took care of them and
[13:24] they're out there saying we loathe this
[13:26] light bread well because it you know you
[13:28] look at it was such a miracle that they
[13:30] received manna every morning to feed
[13:33] them and it tasted like honey and i
[13:35] can't believe why somebody would hate
[13:36] that
[13:39] right
[13:41] but you know what they they load those
[13:42] things but brother adam said it was
[13:44] grace that provided the the fiery
[13:46] serpent that was the pillar of fire at
[13:48] night and the cloud by day and all the
[13:50] things the water from the rock and all
[13:52] those things that came forth they were
[13:54] they were uh
[13:56] the grace of god
[13:58] before them but you know what they they
[14:00] uh
[14:03] they turned it down
[14:06] but he was bringing them along
[14:10] and you know
[14:12] god was bringing them through the land
[14:14] but he told me you say separate from
[14:16] these
[14:18] and you know god was going to lead them
[14:19] through you don't you don't stop you
[14:21] just keep going through
[14:23] and when you see when you come into the
[14:25] land he said you'll utterly destroy your
[14:27] enemies right why because he promised
[14:29] that he said you will utterly destroy
[14:31] your enemies well you come to numbers
[14:33] chapter 21 and you come in there and you
[14:35] know they're passing through the land
[14:37] and they were coming through the land of
[14:38] the amorites and and zehn was that was
[14:41] the king at the time and you know they
[14:43] wanted to pass through and and israel
[14:45] sent out their messengers and said can
[14:47] we pass through the land so we're not
[14:49] going to drink your water said we're not
[14:51] going to turn into your fields or your
[14:52] vineyards but we're just going to pass
[14:54] through the land and you know what he
[14:55] said no he said you're not coming
[14:57] through my land why because he was
[14:59] against them he hated them he didn't
[15:02] want them to have anything to do with
[15:03] them and when they started to get too
[15:05] close he attacked them
[15:07] but you know what god had spoken to him
[15:09] and said you will utterly destroy your
[15:11] enemies and what did he do when they
[15:13] were attacked israel to wipe them off
[15:15] the face of the mouth and when the
[15:17] scripture says that they dwelled in the
[15:19] lands of the amorites one because they
[15:21] were attacked
[15:23] but god had promised them that they
[15:24] would they would utterly destroy them
[15:26] and that's what they done
[15:30] and because because of that we know that
[15:32] as we as you go through the book of
[15:33] numbers we know that later on balak rose
[15:36] up and balak saw what took place and it
[15:38] put fear in his heart and you know he
[15:40] come to attack them and he had to find
[15:42] some way to overcome the israel
[15:45] the children of israel as they were
[15:46] passing through and you know that's the
[15:47] reason that when he saw
[15:49] what had taken place that's the reason
[15:51] he rose up and he had to find somebody
[15:54] to fight israel right
[15:56] and that's the reason he got of
[15:59] a hold of
[16:01] got a hold of balaam
[16:03] oh yeah and he wanted balaam to come out
[16:05] there
[16:06] and you know he started speaking of
[16:07] balaam and he said balaam
[16:10] you know he wanted them to look and and
[16:12] find a way to curse him right
[16:15] and he kept looking and he you know he
[16:17] said he couldn't find anything why
[16:19] because he couldn't find iniquity in
[16:21] them he couldn't find anything wrong
[16:22] with them why because they were walking
[16:24] with god and you know he kept going
[16:26] through and he kept saying well you know
[16:27] i'll bless you more if you'll just curse
[16:29] them if you'll curse them you know i'll
[16:31] give you more they like want to bless
[16:33] him and and give him all kinds of stuff
[16:35] you know brother ram talking about
[16:36] balaam you know he said he was a harling
[16:38] prophet you know he done it for money he
[16:40] had greed
[16:43] but you know he couldn't find any way of
[16:45] bless of cursing them
[16:47] and in the process of trying to curse
[16:49] them he ended up blessing them all right
[16:52] and you know and then then he said well
[16:54] go do it again
[16:55] go curse them again end up blessing them
[16:57] again
[16:59] and that's the reason why we read in the
[17:01] scripture here you know that balaam was
[17:03] speaking to balak and and when he laid
[17:05] out the offering and the burnt offerings
[17:07] and he was saying he said that you know
[17:09] he said i can't curse him because he
[17:11] said what god has already blessed i
[17:12] can't curse but he said he said because
[17:15] i can't reverse it he said they've
[17:16] already been blessed
[17:19] amen
[17:21] and he said even even when that when he
[17:22] tried to curse him he ended up blessing
[17:24] them
[17:25] and
[17:26] that scripture tells us that baalik
[17:27] become livid at balaam because every
[17:30] time he tried to curse him he blessed
[17:31] them right right and you know he finally
[17:33] got to the point where he said don't
[17:34] bless them and don't curse them why
[17:36] because he got tired of cursing trying
[17:38] to become a blessing
[17:40] he said don't even do anything
[17:42] but what was it he started to lay out a
[17:44] plan
[17:47] to get to get to the children of israel
[17:49] but you know what they were blessed
[17:51] they were so blessed that you know what
[17:53] it didn't matter what came against them
[17:54] they were still blessed
[17:57] and you know that's the way you and i
[17:58] are
[18:02] we're so blessed that we're walking
[18:04] through no matter what comes our way
[18:06] we're blessed
[18:07] just as they were they were blessed but
[18:09] you know what they got to one place and
[18:11] balaam had laid it out there and all of
[18:13] a sudden because of their because of the
[18:15] uh idols
[18:18] you know they got too close
[18:20] and it said they they dwelt in the in
[18:22] the
[18:25] in the
[18:26] planes there and
[18:29] when it's when that took place they were
[18:31] just stationary and they started having
[18:33] a fellowship with them
[18:35] why because balaam told them said oh
[18:37] we're we're just like you are
[18:39] we're just like you
[18:42] well you know there's a difference in
[18:43] being like somebody and being somebody
[18:48] you know the you know in school you know
[18:50] they always told us about being a what's
[18:52] the difference between a metaphor and a
[18:53] simile
[18:55] you know they say you know they'll say
[18:56] all all the world's a stage and we each
[18:58] play a part
[19:01] you know that because you know they they
[19:03] talk about being something but then they
[19:04] say something is like something yeah
[19:07] well as soon as you say i'm i'm like
[19:09] something well then you're actually
[19:11] saying i'm not that
[19:12] right
[19:14] right because you're saying just like
[19:16] just like
[19:17] you know the the famous the famous
[19:18] saying is life is like a box of
[19:20] chocolates
[19:22] well you know it's not it's not a box of
[19:24] chocolates but it's like that
[19:28] well you know satan said that i'm going
[19:30] to be like the most high i will receive
[19:33] worship and be just like almighty god
[19:36] but you know what he couldn't be but he
[19:38] said i'm going to be like him
[19:40] and so he said we're just like you well
[19:43] that meant that he's not right
[19:46] that was the first thing was that he
[19:47] came and said oh we're fundamental you
[19:48] know we had our seven altars and we
[19:50] worshipped in all these tight things
[19:54] you know they stayed long enough to
[19:55] listen to the message
[19:58] and they listened to it and when it came
[19:59] along then he said oh we got you now
[20:02] because all of a sudden they started
[20:04] bringing in idol worship and you know
[20:06] what they got too calm and comfortable
[20:08] where they were and the next thing you
[20:10] know they were out worshiping with the
[20:12] idols and eating things sacrificed to
[20:14] idols
[20:16] and god had told them you just keep
[20:17] moving through because they had a place
[20:19] to go to but you know what ended up
[20:21] costing those people their lives
[20:24] because they got comfortable where they
[20:25] were
[20:33] so
[20:36] we have to be
[20:38] careful about where we go
[20:41] but you know we're we're blessed but we
[20:43] have to stay behind the word
[20:45] there's a place for you
[20:47] to stay just like they were
[20:51] and you know there's a there's a there's
[20:52] a way that that we must go
[20:55] you know that one of the things that
[20:56] when the when the children of israel
[20:58] were passing through you know they said
[21:01] they told them when they wanted to go
[21:02] through the land they said you know
[21:04] we're not going we don't want to be in
[21:06] in other areas we don't want to be in
[21:08] your vineyard we don't want to be in in
[21:10] your in your fields we don't want to
[21:11] take park near water
[21:13] he said we had one place that we want to
[21:14] go the scripture says they said we want
[21:17] to be on the king's highway
[21:19] we just want to be right there and
[21:21] that's where they ought to be was right
[21:22] on the king's highway and sister joyce
[21:25] liked that because
[21:27] she likes that song
[21:29] it's a highway to heaven
[21:31] none can walk up there but the pure in
[21:33] heart
[21:34] because you know there is a highway and
[21:36] it's not a wide way but it is a highway
[21:40] because why because god has standards
[21:42] and there is a highway
[21:45] and you know when when brother branham
[21:47] told the told the uh vision i think is
[21:49] his mother was had the had the dream
[21:51] about the woman and the high-heeled
[21:52] shoes and she come along and your
[21:54] brother branham was telling her said
[21:55] sister you can't walk this way dressed
[21:57] like that and those in those shoes you
[22:00] can't make it this way and she said oh
[22:02] yes i can and she tried to climb those
[22:04] steps up onto the road and you know she
[22:06] couldn't make it and he kept telling her
[22:08] but you know she only went just a little
[22:09] ways and then she fell off and he said
[22:11] you know you heard such horrible
[22:13] screaming as she was falling
[22:15] and you know because why because god has
[22:17] a high way because there's a there's a
[22:19] way to get up there and you can only go
[22:22] by his way
[22:23] and he wants you to walk in that way you
[22:26] know he said it was justification
[22:28] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[22:29] ghost to come up into his way and he has
[22:32] a way that he wants you to go
[22:34] and he said as the scripture says you
[22:36] know there is a highway i believe it is
[22:37] in in isaiah that tells us he said even
[22:40] even a fool even if a fool was aryan you
[22:42] know he can still make it because you
[22:44] know what it's so simple god will lead
[22:46] you
[22:47] amen
[22:48] it's so it's so simple that even even no
[22:50] matter how most illiterate person in the
[22:53] in the world can understand the message
[22:56] can understand and have a relationship
[22:58] with god that he can lead you and guide
[23:00] you in all truth
[23:02] there's a way to go
[23:05] so we have we have this way to go but
[23:08] you know what we are we are blessed in
[23:09] this way
[23:11] and you know there's many people that
[23:12] have that have walked this way and
[23:14] they've ended up in a lot of different
[23:16] places but you know what god has a way
[23:18] for you
[23:19] and god and it doesn't matter how you
[23:21] how it looks in the beginning it's way
[23:23] it is in the end because you know a lot
[23:25] of people have started on on a journey
[23:28] and and you know just as they come out
[23:29] of egypt they started out really good
[23:32] but you know what those that were in the
[23:34] desert in the wilderness you know what
[23:36] they become dissatisfied with things but
[23:38] you know what they were two of them mo
[23:40] joshua and caleb why because they kept
[23:43] their eyes on the prize the whole time
[23:46] they saw what the end result was going
[23:48] to be and you know it didn't matter how
[23:50] they got and how much problems they had
[23:53] they still had their eye on the goal and
[23:55] they were still waiting to get in and
[23:57] even after caleb had went all those
[23:59] years and had to put up and see all the
[24:01] things that he had to see you know what
[24:03] he never lost his zeal for his for his
[24:06] promise for the promised land for him to
[24:08] go to his portion of the land never got
[24:11] tired he always kept thinking about that
[24:13] and even when he was so old and
[24:15] everybody thought you know caleb you
[24:16] need to sit down and rest he said i'm
[24:18] just as good as i was when i walked
[24:20] through the land and i saw the promise
[24:22] with my own eyes
[24:25] and he walked through there and he told
[24:27] joshua he said give me my mountain why
[24:29] because he still was standing out there
[24:31] sharpening the sword because whoever was
[24:33] in his way he was going to kill him he
[24:35] was going to cut his way through why
[24:37] because it was his promise
[24:41] you and i have a promise but you know
[24:44] what you've got to claim your promise
[24:46] because if you don't claim it you know
[24:48] what it's as good as giving it to the
[24:50] devil
[24:51] but you know there's many things that
[24:52] the prophet had to say and you know if
[24:54] we look at what what the prophet said in
[24:57] the message you know it amaze us
[25:01] it'll amaze us what the promises of god
[25:03] to us are
[25:07] i found i was reading the other day and
[25:08] something stood out to me
[25:11] now now when i do quotes i feel sorry
[25:13] for the brothers in the back because i
[25:15] don't ever do anything in order
[25:17] and
[25:19] they said we don't believe in
[25:20] organization so i don't believe in
[25:21] organization
[25:25] i get there sometimes but most time i
[25:27] don't
[25:29] but you know
[25:33] this is from revelation chapter one
[25:37] i'm sorry revelation chapter 4 1960 12
[25:39] 31
[25:42] and he's talking about
[25:43] our because our cousins all dressed up
[25:47] and he said
[25:50] he said they do wrong thing too
[25:53] he said but there's nothing hurt about
[25:54] it you see
[25:56] they're kind of classy
[25:58] said you don't hear about that
[26:00] he said but let some pentecostal
[26:02] minister make a mistake one time and
[26:04] brother i'm telling you they'll packer
[26:06] across the country in every newspaper
[26:08] yes sir let some pentecostal brother
[26:10] pray for a child and it dies every
[26:12] newspaper in the country will pack it
[26:15] divine healing is fanaticism well then
[26:18] why don't one why not put every case in
[26:22] the paper that the doctor loses sauce
[26:24] for the goose is sauce for the gander
[26:26] see so if they would do that they
[26:28] wouldn't have enough room in the columns
[26:30] of the papers to ride all the dead right
[26:33] if i go out here to the graveyard and
[26:35] say everybody that ever died under
[26:37] divine healing stand up and then say
[26:39] everybody ever died under medical
[26:41] treatment stand up would outnumber them
[26:43] a million to one that's exactly right so
[26:45] they're going to criticize one and
[26:47] criticize the other so that's right but
[26:49] they kill a million a year with
[26:51] medicines and operations and you never
[26:53] hear a word about it
[26:56] you know i thought that was amazing i
[26:58] read that you know what people got there
[27:00] got their confidence in a doctor yeah
[27:04] how many people want to take a mig into
[27:05] one odds
[27:15] you saw you talk about people where
[27:16] people got their confidence
[27:20] you know what anybody that's actually
[27:21] ever believed god and had faith
[27:24] show me one person that where it's ever
[27:26] failed right
[27:31] brother bran was talking talking about
[27:33] having a prayer line
[27:34] said this woman would come through and
[27:36] she was on crutches and they were they
[27:38] had a place where they were laying them
[27:39] all down and putting all their their
[27:41] wheelchairs and everything to the side
[27:43] and he was talking to that sister and
[27:44] she come through and
[27:46] and he told her he said well sister he
[27:48] said you know if you believe he said
[27:49] just walk right over there and lay your
[27:51] crutches down yeah
[27:53] he said just throw him off down there
[27:55] and she said well brother branham i've
[27:56] been on him for two years
[27:59] he said sister if you believe just throw
[28:01] them down yeah
[28:03] well i've been on them for two years
[28:04] throw them down
[28:07] but you know what he said she didn't
[28:08] have faith but she stood in the line but
[28:10] she didn't have faith and he said next
[28:12] thing you know she just walked off on
[28:13] those crutches
[28:14] hey this little grandmother walked up
[28:16] there and said somebody had to help her
[28:18] get up there and she got up to brother
[28:19] branham and brother branham said sister
[28:21] he said just go over there to the pile
[28:23] and just throw your crutches down said
[28:25] they had to help her get over to them
[28:26] crutches where them piles were but when
[28:28] she got over said bless her heart she
[28:29] could barely move her arms to get him up
[28:31] on the pile but she got him up there and
[28:33] as soon as she laid him down said she
[28:34] went running through the building
[28:40] do we look at do we look at our
[28:41] circumstances or we look at what god's
[28:43] saying
[28:45] you know the thing is i think god
[28:47] i had a i had to have a i broke i
[28:49] chipped a tooth the other day and had to
[28:51] go to the doctor yes the dentist
[28:52] yesterday and the dentist told me said
[28:54] your jaw's gonna hurt
[28:56] and he gave me some medicine and you
[28:58] know pain medicine he told me take this
[29:00] and you know do exercises and he kept
[29:01] telling me all this well i took i took
[29:03] his medicine yesterday and last night
[29:06] but you know when i got up this morning
[29:08] i didn't hurt i didn't what my jaw
[29:10] wasn't sore i didn't have any problems
[29:12] with it but the doctor you know if i
[29:14] could have listened to the dentist no
[29:15] listen i could have woke up this morning
[29:17] my face would have been swollen
[29:19] and i couldn't make nothing but soup
[29:24] but you know what i got up this morning
[29:26] you know i didn't have a bit of problems
[29:30] why because you know i could have
[29:31] listened to what he said but i didn't
[29:33] nothing bothered me why because i have i
[29:35] have the confidence
[29:37] to believe that i you know by his
[29:39] stripes i'm healed well if that's true
[29:40] then you know what i'm still going to
[29:42] eat what i want to
[29:46] but you know a lot of people don't
[29:47] listen to the doctor
[29:50] they take they take whatever's said and
[29:52] they believe it
[29:55] but you know i'm going to stand with
[29:57] i got confidence in and things
[30:00] more than 100 and 100 to 1 odds
[30:05] well i thank god for science i thank god
[30:08] for medicine but you know what it has
[30:10] its place
[30:11] right
[30:12] but you know what it's not going it's
[30:13] not going to it's not going to be the
[30:14] cure-all it's not going to be the
[30:15] fix-all because you know what they're
[30:17] they're only so limited in what they can
[30:19] do and they can tell you so much but
[30:20] after that you've got to have some place
[30:22] to put your faith have put your
[30:24] confidence or what are you going to do
[30:28] you know this man they had a had a man
[30:30] one time brother was telling about and
[30:33] said they got up there
[30:35] he had brain cancer you know they they
[30:37] told him said well listen sir said we're
[30:39] gonna have to take out so much your
[30:40] brain and it's gonna affect this part of
[30:43] your fun you know your speech and you
[30:45] know you're gonna have problems with
[30:46] this and you're gonna have problems with
[30:48] that and all these type things and
[30:49] they'll take this part of your brain out
[30:51] you're gonna have this and and all these
[30:53] type things and he's uh-huh
[30:56] he said well they went through and they
[30:57] took all that out and said you know what
[30:59] he got up he walked
[31:01] he talked
[31:02] he could remember yeah
[31:04] and he said why was that he said well i
[31:05] was just too stupid not to believe him
[31:10] he said well an educated person won't
[31:11] believe what the doctor told him doctor
[31:13] told him you wasn't going to remember
[31:15] nothing you couldn't walk he's going to
[31:16] be a vegetable he's i'm thinking well
[31:17] you know what he just went over and done
[31:18] about his business right sure he said i
[31:21] walked in talking i walked out talking
[31:24] but you know what he could have took
[31:25] that and said well you know what i'm
[31:27] just gonna give up and you know i'm just
[31:29] gonna be a vegetable
[31:32] but you know what it because it's by you
[31:34] what you say by yours by your speech by
[31:37] your faith by your confession is what
[31:39] what takes place
[31:40] and you can you can walk because you
[31:42] know what everywhere you turn in every
[31:44] aspect of your life everything is going
[31:46] to be negative
[31:47] there's there's nothing there's nothing
[31:49] going to be positive but you know what
[31:50] there's one place positive and that's in
[31:52] christ because you know what he said he
[31:55] said that the son of god he said he's
[31:57] got a positive hold on calvary and
[32:00] calvary's got a positive hold on him
[32:02] well if calvary's got a positive hold on
[32:04] me then everything that was purchased
[32:06] at calvary is mine and i can hand it
[32:08] hand to it and and receive it and then
[32:11] it's mine and the devil can't take it
[32:13] away from me whatever i have need of i
[32:15] can draw from an inexhaustible fountain
[32:18] of christ and i can receive whatever i
[32:20] have need of
[32:22] because everything that was given to me
[32:24] was given to me in the new birth
[32:27] everything i needed for this earthly
[32:29] journey was given to me when i was born
[32:31] again well if that's true then when that
[32:33] right now i have everything that i have
[32:35] need of inside of me but he said all you
[32:37] got to do is drink and push out
[32:42] but there's an inexhaustible fountain
[32:44] that you can tap into
[32:48] all through the scripture
[32:51] god has spoken
[32:53] to
[32:54] people speaking in
[32:57] in times that that look it look amazing
[33:03] and we're just
[33:05] you know when we're at their worst
[33:10] but god spoken
[33:12] and told them what was going to take
[33:14] place what would happen
[33:16] all through the scripture
[33:18] you know
[33:19] and you're looking and when things
[33:21] happen in your life
[33:24] you know how do you respond to those
[33:26] things
[33:27] how are you going to respond when things
[33:29] happen in your life
[33:30] right
[33:31] and you know there's many there's many
[33:32] things that i wanted i want to look at
[33:35] some different things and i had some
[33:37] different message i was trying to figure
[33:38] out which way to go and you know but
[33:40] i've been reading a little bit about
[33:42] about david and
[33:44] you know david had a desire
[33:47] when he was with nathan you know he said
[33:49] he said i dwell in
[33:51] in the house of cedar and he said the
[33:53] lord he said he dwells in the curtains
[33:56] he said he dwells in a tent and he said
[33:58] why not he said i want to go out and
[33:59] build him a a house i want to build the
[34:02] temple right he said i had a desire and
[34:05] nathan said he said david he said you
[34:07] you're the servant of god he said he
[34:09] said do whatever's in your heart to do
[34:12] but you know he walked out there and
[34:13] then when nathan walked away god come
[34:15] and told nathan he said go tell my
[34:17] servant david
[34:19] he said you'll not build me a temple
[34:21] right he said he said i brought you out
[34:23] of the sheep coat he said i've made you
[34:26] a great name in the world he said i
[34:27] brought you from nothing and he said i
[34:29] made you everything he said well even
[34:31] when saul turned away from me he said i
[34:33] made you and you're a man after my own
[34:35] heart he said but you're not going to
[34:37] build that temple
[34:40] you know it's so amazing you know he
[34:41] could have got he could have gotten very
[34:43] despondent about that he could have got
[34:45] very down because god told him said do
[34:47] not build that temple
[34:49] but you know what he told him he gave
[34:50] him a promise
[34:52] he told him he said the sun that which
[34:54] will come out of your loins will build
[34:56] the temple
[34:57] he said there's a son he said the son of
[34:59] david will build it right brother
[35:00] branham said it was a type of christ
[35:02] coming in the end time
[35:07] what what he said when he come what's he
[35:09] going to do he's building a spiritual
[35:11] temple a tabernacle for him to live in
[35:14] amen
[35:15] but you know what david could have
[35:16] gotten upset he could have got down
[35:18] about it but you know what he done he
[35:20] went out there and he got enthused why
[35:22] because the temple was going to get
[35:23] built he could have got he could have
[35:25] been upset but he rejoiced in what was
[35:27] going to take place and he went out
[35:28] there and you know what he hired men
[35:31] stone masons to form the rocks the
[35:33] stones that would make up the temple he
[35:35] went out and got the wood and he got the
[35:37] men and all the
[35:39] silver and gold and all the things why
[35:41] because he started laying everything out
[35:45] and then he went to his son
[35:47] solomon
[35:48] before his death and started telling him
[35:50] and you know that was the one thing that
[35:51] he done was he encouraged him and you
[35:54] know he got he told solomon he said you
[35:56] know build the temple you know what
[35:58] because he wanted solomon to have the
[36:00] same desire that laid inside of him for
[36:02] that temple
[36:06] he wanted him he wanted to have the same
[36:08] zeal
[36:10] and you and i we can have the zeal but
[36:12] you know what we need to teach our
[36:13] children to have the same kind of zeal
[36:15] that they can see the seal in us that
[36:18] they need to have in their life
[36:20] that they can want to build up a
[36:21] spiritual tabernacle under jesus christ
[36:24] why because you know what if you don't
[36:26] do it and i don't do it you know what
[36:28] the devil's going to be right there to
[36:29] snatch them up
[36:34] when he said when when when the enemy
[36:36] comes in like a flood he said the spirit
[36:38] of god will raise up a standard well you
[36:40] know what you and i are that standard
[36:42] well because young people will get
[36:44] washed away they'll get carried away
[36:53] i was speaking to
[36:55] a man that i worked with his wife was
[36:57] telling me
[36:59] about a young girl
[37:03] and you know she's had she's had a rough
[37:05] life and she's she's in a mental
[37:07] institution now and
[37:08] and she was asking me to pray for
[37:11] remember this little girl name was
[37:12] michelle and you know he was she was
[37:15] telling me about
[37:16] the life that she had to live and
[37:18] you know her mom was a very abusive to
[37:20] her and and all these type things and
[37:22] now she's just gotten to the point where
[37:24] she don't want to be around people she
[37:25] she's against everybody
[37:29] and you know she was in there and
[37:32] they said you know she got she was
[37:33] whatever with her
[37:34] aunt and uncle which is their next-door
[37:36] neighbor
[37:37] and you know because because her uncle
[37:40] was was her mom's brother
[37:43] you know it that the uh
[37:47] the anger
[37:48] that she had toward her mom
[37:51] she put on her uncle
[37:53] and so anytime she wanted to lash out
[37:55] she couldn't she couldn't see her mom
[37:57] she couldn't lash at her but you know
[37:58] what she done that to her uncle yeah and
[38:00] it was always and you know and he tried
[38:02] to do everything that he could for
[38:04] and you know it was just on and on and
[38:06] and you know finally she just got out in
[38:08] the yard
[38:08] and they have young kids and she just
[38:10] got out in the yard and slit her wrists
[38:12] and
[38:13] and you know they end up putting her in
[38:14] a hospital and everything but you know
[38:17] she said she she's so she because of why
[38:20] the way she grew up
[38:22] the things that she saw and faced
[38:24] growing up she don't know how to any way
[38:26] to get rid of that
[38:28] why because it's so bottled up in her
[38:29] and then and you see this
[38:33] and now she's in a mental institution
[38:35] well the only thing she needs is god
[38:40] because you know it's just it's just the
[38:42] devil it's the way he works but you know
[38:44] young people the devil's out there he
[38:47] comes and he's going to steal kill and
[38:50] destroy
[38:51] he can take everything that he can
[38:55] but you know if you and i have to have
[38:56] to raise up and be a be that standard we
[39:00] have to show them the zeal
[39:03] because you know what if they don't see
[39:04] it in us who are they going to see it in
[39:10] because you know
[39:11] brother brown said you know you can't
[39:13] have you can't have a counterfeit can't
[39:15] have a counterfeit dollar until you have
[39:17] a genuine dollar
[39:19] that's right
[39:21] but that's one that's all satan's ever
[39:22] going to show you
[39:25] he's going he's going to show you the
[39:26] counterfeit
[39:30] you know
[39:30] i remember growing up and
[39:32] you know it seemed like every time you
[39:34] turn around there's there's people in in
[39:36] the church there's people in the message
[39:37] they're all time fighting and arguing
[39:39] and bickering and it's just and you
[39:41] think my lord where's the where's god in
[39:43] all of this
[39:46] and people can you get discouraged i
[39:48] remember as a kid you know you look at
[39:50] some of the stuff
[39:51] what is this
[39:53] but you know what that's what god that's
[39:55] what the devil wants you to focus on
[39:57] one because that's where that's where
[39:59] satan is going to be right there in the
[40:01] message he's going to be right there
[40:03] amongst everybody
[40:06] he said in every in every crowd you're
[40:08] going to have the believers the
[40:09] unbelievers and the make-believers he's
[40:11] going to be right there brother adam
[40:13] said in in christ the mystery you know
[40:14] he was talking about
[40:16] waxing closer together he said love one
[40:18] another loved one lover above everything
[40:21] else
[40:22] he said he said you know because you
[40:23] know he said he'll bring somebody in
[40:25] under the quietness and everything and
[40:27] he said he'll bring that person in he
[40:28] said he'd shoot him full of deadly
[40:30] poison he said don't take sides with
[40:32] that
[40:33] why because that's his job to do that
[40:36] he's going to be doing that it's going
[40:37] to be all over the place
[40:39] but you know we can get discouraged
[40:41] about it or we can realize hey we need
[40:43] to be our children's holy ghost until
[40:46] they get their own
[40:47] but you know we need to make sure that
[40:49] they see god in us
[40:51] that's not it's not just some quote it's
[40:53] not just some book it's not some picture
[40:56] but it's a life
[41:00] because that's what that's what i want
[41:01] ever
[41:02] my kids to see
[41:05] i want i want them to know who god he is
[41:09] i don't i want them to know that god is
[41:11] just some something we talk about
[41:14] i want some i want them to be somebody
[41:15] that's real to them that's
[41:18] right
[41:20] you know
[41:22] not too long ago
[41:24] i tell you this not too long ago adam
[41:26] you know every time he gets sick he gets
[41:27] hurt you know daddy prayed for me daddy
[41:29] pray for me he wanted me to pray for him
[41:32] and so you know we we pray a lot and
[41:37] but you know he was he was sick the
[41:39] other day and
[41:40] he ran the favor and nauseated real bad
[41:42] and
[41:43] everything like that
[41:45] you know and
[41:46] then he got in there
[41:49] told sarah he was going to pray and
[41:50] they're praying for himself
[41:52] he's in there praying for himself
[41:54] in the bathroom and you know he went in
[41:56] there
[41:58] and
[41:59] he'd been so nauseated and it just i
[42:01] mean it just tore him up bad and and
[42:03] y'all forgive me for what i'm saying but
[42:04] i want you to understand it he went in
[42:07] there and he he was praying and when he
[42:09] got done he was in he was in the
[42:10] bathroom he just been so sick and he'd
[42:12] been in the bathroom and he was standing
[42:13] there and he got finished praying he
[42:15] said bye-bye puke
[42:24] he was done with it or because he
[42:26] believed and that's the way it was he
[42:27] believed that when he got done praying
[42:29] that god would touch him and then he
[42:31] said bye-bye i'm done with it
[42:37] and that's the way it's got to be
[42:38] whatever you have whatever your problem
[42:40] is you got to do the same thing you got
[42:42] to separate yourself when you pray and
[42:44] lay it on the altar of god you say bye
[42:45] i'm done with it i'm not carrying this
[42:47] anymore i'm not going to let this hinder
[42:49] me anymore but you know we can still
[42:51] carry that around say well you know i
[42:53] took it to the lord i'm still packing it
[42:55] well that's not what we're supposed to
[42:56] be doing
[42:59] there's a lot of things people people
[43:03] they
[43:04] carry the carry their burdens with them
[43:05] right
[43:06] well they should have laid them down
[43:09] you know that little story talking about
[43:10] the about the
[43:12] the man that wanted the child wanted the
[43:14] daddy to fix the toy for him
[43:18] he said daddy why don't you fix my toy
[43:20] and i keep asking you to fix it
[43:24] he said son how can i fix it
[43:27] he said you never let it go
[43:31] you know because he kept holding on to
[43:33] it he kept holding on to it there you
[43:35] know he never was going to give it over
[43:37] he well daddy you can fix it but i'm
[43:39] gonna hold on to it yeah i'm gonna hold
[43:41] on to it you can fix it yeah right
[43:44] well don't fix it don't work that way
[43:47] until he gave it over to the daddy
[43:50] and said it showers you you take care of
[43:52] it then he was able to do something
[43:55] about it
[43:56] but if we hold on to it and get in god's
[43:57] way
[43:59] he can't fix it he can't work it out
[44:02] he's we stand in his way
[44:06] but david
[44:09] went back to david when when he went
[44:11] through all this and
[44:13] had that zeal and laid out all the
[44:15] things for them to build the tavern
[44:17] built the temple
[44:18] you know he had that desire and he gave
[44:20] it to solomon and solomon was building
[44:22] the temple but you know he come through
[44:24] and
[44:26] you know was laying out all these things
[44:27] and
[44:32] second second chronicles 6 10 the
[44:34] scripture of solomon speaking says the
[44:36] lord therefore hath performed his word
[44:38] that he spoke and for i am risen up in
[44:40] the high in the room of david my father
[44:43] and am sent on the throne of israel as
[44:45] the lord promised and i have built the
[44:48] house for the name of the lord god of
[44:50] israel
[44:52] see because he knew he said god spoke it
[44:55] and god and he was going to perform it
[44:57] right and see it was just him being
[44:59] there
[45:00] it was the instrument that god worked
[45:02] through but you know what he said god
[45:04] build it amen that i that you know
[45:06] because it was what god said and he rose
[45:09] up to to build it
[45:11] amen that he just worked through solomon
[45:13] to build it
[45:15] and they had that god had had done that
[45:18] for him
[45:19] thank you lord right
[45:22] and you know we just have to be faithful
[45:23] in what we do
[45:25] god just wants us to be faithful
[45:28] god wants us to be faithful in his work
[45:30] right
[45:32] you know there's there's many things
[45:34] that happen that but god wants us to be
[45:36] faithful
[45:37] you know in the in the book of daniel
[45:39] when daniel was speaking and you know he
[45:42] said that you know they they've been in
[45:43] bondage for 68 years and then they had
[45:45] two more years that they would be coming
[45:47] out of bondage and and god was speaking
[45:48] to to daniel and you know he prophesied
[45:51] and told him he said you know
[45:54] that in time he said that they'll
[45:55] rebuild the wall and the streets would
[45:57] be rebuilt he said even in troubles
[45:59] times but you know there came a time
[46:02] that when you read in the book of ezra
[46:03] and nehemiah you know they rose up
[46:06] because they they saw that the land of
[46:08] their of their kindred that their
[46:10] fathers had come from that it laid in
[46:12] waste and you know that rose up
[46:14] something in them to go rebuild it and
[46:17] you know they went to they went out and
[46:19] started to rebuild this
[46:21] and you know you look at what they had
[46:22] to do but god told them he said you're
[46:24] going to rebuild this
[46:27] and you know you look back and go back
[46:28] and when he spoke that they would
[46:29] rebuild it
[46:32] go back and look how they had to rebuild
[46:33] it
[46:36] what does the scripture say they had
[46:37] stood with a sword in one hand they're
[46:39] working with the other they had people
[46:40] that was guarding them while they were
[46:42] working
[46:45] the whole time why they had but they had
[46:46] a promise to rebuild
[46:49] the word had been spoken but you know
[46:51] what it wasn't easy
[46:53] but they had to rebuild
[46:55] something rose up in them to do that
[46:57] and you know even when you go back and
[46:59] you start reading in the book of ezra
[47:01] when they come up there and the and the
[47:03] uh the enemy the scripture says that the
[47:05] enemies of believers benjamin and gad
[47:07] were there and then you know they rose
[47:08] up and they said you know we come to
[47:10] help you rebuild we want to be part of
[47:12] you with your god we want to worship
[47:14] your god and all and these type things
[47:16] we're saying unto them and then they
[47:18] turned and said no
[47:20] said you have nothing to do with this
[47:23] this is ours not yours
[47:27] and you know when they walked away then
[47:29] they become then they become the end
[47:31] because you know at first
[47:33] it looks so good
[47:35] we want we want to be we want to help
[47:38] you
[47:40] we want to be your friend
[47:44] that's exactly the way that the devil
[47:46] works
[47:48] see they were they said no you're not
[47:50] because you're not a part of us
[47:52] you're not one of us you're not in this
[47:54] work this is ours this is the land of
[47:57] our fathers this is ours so you're not
[47:59] going to have anything to do with it
[48:01] see they could have went in there and
[48:03] said oh yeah praise the lord we got more
[48:04] help
[48:06] and it just been nothing but a big
[48:07] hindrance
[48:08] it'd have been the way the devil worked
[48:12] he said you know you turn them out next
[48:13] thing you know what they do if they if
[48:15] they really wanted to help then why
[48:17] weren't they staying out of the way
[48:19] the next time they rose up to fight
[48:21] against them
[48:23] here they are out fighting against them
[48:25] trying to trying to
[48:27] defeat what they're doing trying to tear
[48:28] it up
[48:30] but you know what they rose up and they
[48:32] stood there and they had to fight their
[48:33] way through but you know what they build
[48:35] it right they rose up and build it
[48:40] see all the way through the scripture it
[48:41] may not be the way that you want it to
[48:43] be but you know it's the way god has it
[48:44] laid out right
[48:47] because you know you say you're more
[48:48] than a conqueror then guess what you got
[48:50] to conquer something right
[48:52] you've got to overcome but you got to be
[48:54] more than a conqueror
[48:55] you've got to overcome boy we say well
[48:57] we've seen that we've been made more
[48:59] than a conqueror well then you got a
[49:00] then you gotta be more than a conqueror
[49:04] and if you're gonna do that it's gonna
[49:05] be more than just getting by within the
[49:07] skin of your teeth
[49:12] see it it's all these type things but
[49:14] you know you've got to come through that
[49:16] you've got to overcome that but you know
[49:19] what it's been spoken
[49:21] and if it's been spoken that it's going
[49:22] to come to pass all right
[49:26] now i want to
[49:28] read a read a scripture here
[49:31] and
[49:31] they don't have this one either but
[49:33] we're going to
[49:34] read ezekiel 37.
[49:37] i'm going to read this
[49:39] ezekiel chapter 37. it's a valley of dry
[49:42] bones of vision but
[49:45] i like this scripture
[49:49] and i'm just going i want to start verse
[49:51] one and just work my way through but
[49:56] it says the hand of the lord was upon me
[49:58] and carried me out in the spirit of the
[50:00] lord and set me down in the midst of the
[50:01] valley which was full of bones and
[50:03] caused me to pass by them round about
[50:05] and behold there were
[50:08] many in the open valley and lo
[50:10] they were very dry and he said unto me
[50:12] son of man can these bones live and i
[50:15] answered oh lord
[50:16] god thou knoweth
[50:18] and again he said unto me prophesy unto
[50:20] these bones and say unto them o ye dry
[50:23] bones hear the word of the lord thus
[50:25] saith the lord god unto these bones
[50:27] behold i will cause breath to enter into
[50:30] you and you shall live and i will lay
[50:32] sinews upon you and will bring up flesh
[50:36] upon you and cover you with skin and put
[50:38] breath in you and you shall live
[50:40] and ye shall know that i am the lord
[50:44] so i prophesied as i was commanded and
[50:47] as i prophesied there was a noise and
[50:50] behold a shaking and the bones came
[50:53] together bone to his bone and then i
[50:56] beheld lo the sinews and flesh come upon
[50:58] them and skin covered them
[51:01] above and there but there was no breath
[51:03] in them then he said unto me prophesy
[51:06] unto the wind prophesy son of man
[51:10] and say unto when thus saith the lord
[51:12] god come from the four winds o breath
[51:15] and breathe upon these slain that they
[51:18] may live so i pray for so i prophesied
[51:21] as he commanded me and the breath came
[51:23] into them and they lived and stood up on
[51:26] their feet and exceeding great army amen
[51:30] so he spoke unto and was speaking of
[51:32] that you know he could see these
[51:35] these bones
[51:36] and your brother brown spoke
[51:38] i believe it was in the restoration of
[51:39] the bride tree you know he was speaking
[51:41] of those four stages of of
[51:44] resurrection
[51:45] of restoration you know and he said you
[51:47] know each one of them came to their into
[51:49] the bones and the sinew and the skin
[51:51] came upon them but he said you know
[51:53] there was no breath in them and you bet
[51:55] you know he had but he said he's
[51:57] god spoken to him and he said he said
[51:59] you prophesy and he said that the bones
[52:01] will come together he said the sin you
[52:03] will come on them the flesh shall come
[52:05] on them and he said then i will breathe
[52:06] into them
[52:08] but you know what he said he said when
[52:09] he said i'll breathe into him but then
[52:11] he turned around and said son of man
[52:12] prophesy to the four winds that they'll
[52:14] come upon them
[52:18] and that's what he said he said that he
[52:19] said he prophesied and he said and they
[52:20] and the breath breath of god came into
[52:22] them and they rose up and he said they
[52:24] become an exceeding great army
[52:28] then said unto me son of man these bones
[52:30] are the whole house of israel verse 11.
[52:33] behold they say our bones are dried and
[52:35] our hope is lost we are cut off from our
[52:38] parts
[52:41] see there's a prophecy
[52:43] that's their confession
[52:46] we're cut off
[52:49] he said therefore prophesy and say unto
[52:52] them thus saith the lord god behold all
[52:54] my people i will open your graves and
[52:57] cause you to come up out of your graves
[52:59] and bring you into the land of israel
[53:02] and you shall know that i am the lord
[53:04] when i have opened up your graves on my
[53:06] people and brought you up out of your
[53:08] graves
[53:09] he said i shall put my spirit in you and
[53:12] you shall live and i shall place you in
[53:14] your own land then shall you know that i
[53:16] am the lord
[53:18] have pur have spoken it and performed it
[53:20] saith the lord
[53:24] you know they said that they were they
[53:26] were cut off they were dried up
[53:28] they were dead
[53:30] but you know what they've been spun and
[53:32] spoken to him
[53:34] and all and all the things that they had
[53:35] went through they said they were you
[53:37] know all these things that happened to
[53:38] him and they looked and they said we
[53:40] have no hope but you know what god had
[53:42] spoken to him
[53:44] and he said and then and look and look
[53:46] what he said he said prophesy he said
[53:48] because i said they'll come together he
[53:51] said they'll stand up he said when my
[53:53] breath comes into them he said they'll
[53:54] be an exceeding great army
[53:57] so here they are but they say oh we're
[53:59] going to we're in such bad shape but you
[54:00] know what he had prophesied to them that
[54:03] they would stand up that they would come
[54:05] together
[54:09] that they and he said i will put my
[54:11] spirit in you
[54:13] my spirit will be in you
[54:17] and there was that great stand and the
[54:18] great standing army there
[54:21] and you know brother branham said he
[54:22] said when the bride recognizes who she
[54:25] is he said then she'll be an invincible
[54:27] army but you know what you've got to
[54:29] believe that
[54:30] amen but you know why because he spoke
[54:33] that and you can say well i've got you
[54:35] know i have no hope and you know
[54:37] everything looks so bad or whatever but
[54:38] you know what you're an exceeding great
[54:40] army right amen
[54:43] that's who you are you're that spiritual
[54:45] israel that's raised up
[54:50] see god doesn't it god sees you one way
[54:53] you may see yourself some other way but
[54:55] god sees you the way he sees you which
[54:57] is through his word what he has spoken
[55:00] of you that's how he sees you right
[55:04] but you have to believe that
[55:07] and you know what when they heard the
[55:08] word of the lord he said then they
[55:10] started to come together
[55:11] they started coming together
[55:14] and then they rose up
[55:17] and that's who you and i are we've heard
[55:20] if we if we hear the word of god if we
[55:22] hear the word of the lord then you know
[55:24] we come together
[55:26] we can come together
[55:29] and raise up and be an exceeding great
[55:30] army
[55:34] see the the scripture is so full of
[55:36] things
[55:39] it's so full of things that speak to us
[55:42] but you know you can receive it but you
[55:44] got to believe it you got to believe who
[55:46] you are right
[55:50] there's a couple other things i want i
[55:52] want to share with you and you know this
[55:54] this one always has stood out to me and
[55:56] and and i love it
[56:00] this is from the message letting off the
[56:01] pressure and brother ram was speaking he
[56:04] said i met a woman here sometimes some
[56:06] years ago in the 10 cent store said she
[56:08] was about 60 years old looked about 30
[56:10] years old and i said how do you do it
[56:12] sister
[56:14] she said brother brandon i've got two
[56:15] sons that's doctors that's older than
[56:17] you are and honest to goodness she
[56:20] didn't look over 30 years old
[56:22] she said here here's what it was when i
[56:24] come to christ
[56:26] when i was about 12 years old i sat down
[56:28] and thought about it and studying other
[56:30] religions
[56:31] and when i found out the truth when i
[56:32] come to christ and took my case my soul
[56:34] my all to him she said i've never had a
[56:36] worry since now he promised to take care
[56:39] of me take care of all my troubles and
[56:41] said if he's not big enough to do it i
[56:43] know i'm not big enough to do it so
[56:45] what's the use of me worrying about it
[56:46] see that's it christ promised that he'd
[56:49] take all your cares cast your cares on
[56:52] him so what are you worried about worry
[56:54] builds up pressure pressure blows up so
[56:57] cast your cares on him and quit worrying
[57:04] heard somebody say one time
[57:07] you know
[57:09] talking on this
[57:10] you know people spend a lot of money
[57:13] trying to trying to fix their
[57:15] their outward appearance
[57:18] you know you know there's there's all
[57:20] kinds of serums and shots and potions
[57:23] and everything else you can think of
[57:24] that people won't try
[57:27] but you know the bible says that you
[57:29] know there's something that that
[57:31] said a merry heart does good like a
[57:33] medicine
[57:36] brother brahman said worry this woman
[57:37] right here you know she went to christ
[57:39] she gave her she gave it all to him
[57:42] where he never bothered her
[57:44] she wasn't full of worry
[57:46] she had something
[57:48] she had a place to
[57:49] anchor to
[57:52] her and heard somebody say one time
[57:55] said you know there's people spent all
[57:57] this time looking for all these things
[57:59] to put money into they got to buy stuff
[58:01] and all this tops
[58:02] these things and sister monica you
[58:04] forgive me for saying this but
[58:06] i know she's in the oils and stuff
[58:09] but the scripture says
[58:10] there's the oil of joy
[58:16] somebody said one time said people like
[58:18] to spend a lot of money women like spend
[58:19] money on everything like that you know
[58:21] what he said the oil of joy is better
[58:22] than the oil of olay
[58:31] people spend a lot of money on a lot of
[58:33] things but you know what if you've got
[58:34] something inside of you it'll come out
[58:36] it'll manifest itself that's right
[58:39] you know what if you've got something
[58:40] bubbling up from the inside you can't
[58:42] contain it
[58:43] right
[58:47] i'm so glad that we have something to
[58:48] turn to but there's something that you
[58:50] can hold on to just like that woman
[58:53] she found something that she could put
[58:55] her absolute in
[58:57] let off the pressure she'd have no worry
[59:00] if god can't take care of it i sure
[59:02] can't take care of it myself there's no
[59:04] me if he's not gonna worry you know
[59:06] why should i worry about it
[59:08] if he said he cast all your cares on him
[59:11] then why should i why am i worried about
[59:13] it i cast him on him he'll take care of
[59:15] it
[59:17] you know the bible's so full of good
[59:18] things
[59:20] you have to get in there and find them
[59:21] find those things that speak to you
[59:25] every every need that you have has been
[59:27] supplied every every need has been met
[59:32] everything that we have need of is is
[59:34] ours
[59:35] but you've got to claim them
[59:38] and the devil's going to be right there
[59:40] the devil's going to be right there to
[59:41] try to hinder you he's going to try to
[59:42] take it away from you
[59:45] but you know what you are more than a
[59:46] conqueror through him that loved us
[59:49] amen god bless you we'll we'll stay and
[59:52] have the musicians come
[59:58] i'm so glad that i have one that i can

[1:19:18] with you
[1:19:20] you know reading
[1:19:24] you know you start
[1:19:25] a thought whether i'm saying you know a
[1:19:27] word is just a thought expressed
[1:19:30] you know you start with a thought
[1:19:33] and it becomes a
[1:19:34] word and then that word becomes an
[1:19:37] action
[1:19:40] and your actions determine your
[1:19:42] destination
[1:19:44] it all starts with what you're thinking
[1:19:47] and what
[1:19:48] you so you have to start in your mind
[1:19:52] you know brother brown said that
[1:19:54] most of our faith was mental faith
[1:19:56] but he said if you add if you pour in
[1:19:58] the word into your middle faith you
[1:20:00] become a spiritual revelation
[1:20:04] you know the thing is people ask you
[1:20:05] know it it may i guarantee it it'll make
[1:20:09] make your day better it'll make
[1:20:11] everything better

[1:20:31] i tell you what you always find you can
[1:20:32] always find the negative but you can
[1:20:34] always find the positive

[1:20:46] work
[1:20:48] people want to look at you kind of funny
[1:20:50] sometimes yeah

[1:20:54] you confess that you'll have a good day
[1:20:57] you can make things happen
[1:21:00] it's all based on creating an atmosphere
[1:21:02] so based on your thoughts
[1:21:06] that's reason i just want i just want to
[1:21:07] be positive i just want to say what he
[1:21:09] said
[1:21:11] because you know what
[1:21:12] if we don't confess what he said about
[1:21:14] us
[1:21:16] then you know what we make him a liar
[1:21:19] if you say something different than what
[1:21:21] he said
[1:21:23] he said by his stripes i'm healed well
[1:21:25] if i confess anything separate than that
[1:21:27] then i'm saying he's a liar
[1:21:30] if if i have a need and i don't and i
[1:21:32] claim well i don't know how i'm going to
[1:21:33] get out of this
[1:21:34] just everything looks so bad

[1:21:57] it here and i read it anytime i go
[1:21:58] preach someplace people ask me say what
[1:22:00] you believe
[1:22:01] i read i read the same quote
[1:22:05] i read brother ram said in the message
[1:22:07] why 1963 talking about that lady she's
[1:22:11] so poor
[1:22:12] turning for help had nobody to help her
[1:22:15] poor and broke
[1:22:17] need to turn to charity for something
[1:22:19] didn't have anything
[1:22:21] but she had a son
[1:22:24] and you know and they were sort of
[1:22:26] investigating her case and trying to
[1:22:27] find out what happened you know why she
[1:22:29] had such bad shape said don't your son
[1:22:31] don't you ever hear from your son oh
[1:22:32] yeah i get sweet letters from him
[1:22:34] wonderful letters from me and so they're
[1:22:36] real pretty pictures
[1:22:40] and they said well let's look at those
[1:22:41] pretty pictures
[1:22:43] and so she went to her bible and she
[1:22:45] opened them up and she pulled out those
[1:22:47] pretty pictures
[1:22:50] and they and she handed them to them
[1:22:53] and somebody looked at them and said you
[1:22:54] know what they were
[1:22:56] they were bank drafts
[1:22:58] her son was in india and he had
[1:23:00] converted the indian money to american
[1:23:02] money and sent her bank drafts
[1:23:05] and brother branham said
[1:23:07] in the lids of her bible
[1:23:10] laid what she had need of
[1:23:12] and he said she just thought she had
[1:23:13] pretty pictures
[1:23:16] and he said brother when when somebody
[1:23:18] tries to tell you
[1:23:20] tries to make a painted fire of
[1:23:22] pentecost
[1:23:23] that jesus says jesus christ isn't the
[1:23:25] same yesterday today and forever he said
[1:23:28] don't you believe that
[1:23:32] he said peter said
[1:23:34] when he when he spoke on the day of
[1:23:36] pentecost he said it's unto you
