it's going with you so remember that all right remember brother Hal Thomas he will they will be putting a pacemaker in uh to him this next week sometime and you know just pray the Lord would bless him and be with him uh glad to have sister twiy back there with us uh Sister freda's Sister we've always called her that I think her name's Margie that's pretty close anyway but we've always called her

missing anything what's the Bible study supposed to be on this time I keep forgetting we're just pretty well open I think and we're having back on to just questions and answers and and all and uh you know now if any of you that wants to listen to them uh you know you can get brother Joe to make you a copy off of it cuz we do tape them but remember don't let it out too far cuz we get sometime pretty personal and call names because it is just in the Fellowship of the church and us with the question questions and answers you know like that but we try not to have too bad of a attitude we try to be the best we can all right let's just pray Romans 8 dear heavenly father we thank you because we know one thing for sure that without you there is no hope whatsoever in any of us what in life but we depend totally upon you and we believe you we thank you and we see you making yourself manifest Among Us in many ways and we thank you for that we pray that you would just guide each and every one of us and be with us tonight you said in your word that you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so just come on the scene today and and speak to our hearts and our lives and then heal these old bodies because they're weing out and we commit Them All to You Lord knowing there's many sicknesses among us but we believe in an eternal God who can take care of them all have your way as we speak about you just let your light shine in each one of our hearts in Jesus Jesus name amen amen so we got Romans 8 that we've been reading for quite a while verse 28 for we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren now remember those who we for know he predestinated so for knowledge comes first you you don't believe that I'm saying it right but most people have got it turned totally around they got their predetermining Factor uh up front you know where the further is back but that doesn't work according to the scripture and the prophet right all right for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be Force who can be against us you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now we have been on uh how does God predestinate and we know as we've read here in the scripture that he said those he did for no he did predestinate so for knowledge comes first and that's you'll find I believe it's five or six quotes in the prophet's message um you know like adoptions and different things where he was saying said that for know for knowledge that predestination looks back to for knowledge see then you can turn and go the other way and see the Destiny coming out of what's doing it he said even election looks back to for knowledge all right so let's don't ever forget the point of how does God predestinate he predestines by his full knowledge all right that way he's not a respector of persons that's right that way we make our own way we choose our own choosing and we go you know and uh and I'm trying my best to cover some things uh about doctrines and issues sometimes that come up and and uh I know I've mentioned it to you many times that you know the in the old Baptist days they had a time there that uh they didn't even want to go have a Revival because they afraid their kids might get saved when God didn't want them saved but if you think that's wrong go home run in your computer two seeds in the spirit two seeds in the spirit and you can read exactly what I've been talking about the man was fighting against missionaries because he didn't he said you know why have missionaries are going to be saved anyway you know and and they had the two seeds and he goes back to Genesis and he says that Eve had two seeds there and it was a good seed and a bad seed The Good Seed could be saved The Bad Seed couldn't be saved so that's way on back in the 18s you know all right so just go back and study these things when I say things to you A lot of times I you know I expect you to to just say well Hey where's that at well I'll just a lot of times tell you where it's at then all right so then the doctrines and things of the issues that we are against is I'm against in any form any idea of you and I as being pre-existent as people right right I don't believe in pre-existence of people I don't believe pre-existence of any form other than eternal life right because God existed alone all right I believe in eternal life existing and that's the only way we could exist is in eternal life if you want to talk about us existing but why I'm worry about it why not just take it to where we're at you know because people believe that you come here with eternal life well if you did Jesus Christ died in vain that solved the whole problems with me but it doesn't with others because they want to quote you to death you know well go ahead but you can't quote above the word of God your quotes run out all right the prophet said if you have eternal life you always was eternal that's sensible right that's no problems that's that's sensible doings because you know if you have it the eternal life is eternal that's why John would say that you know that the seed remaineth in you and he and you cannot sin when the human being part of us can sin every day and the prophet said we did but the seed that remaineth in US cannot sin what seed his seed amen he's his seed's the only one that can't sin and remember we'll get to it later God don't have physical seeds right his seed is his word amen cuz he doesn't have physical seeds see and everybody wants to try to put something inside out of us you know why not just go simply the way we're going and have it to be that the little woman at the whale had representation by predestination all right then we can get back and see it in the correct order but remember now what we're saying that predestination looks back to forn knowledge forn knowledge then looks forward to Destiny all right so it's for knowledge first or else we miss the whole thing okay then not to spend much time on that but to try to to get it connected together maybe you didn't follow me as much this past Sunday afternoon as maybe I wanted you to but we talked about that we don't believe in Eternal sunship amen we showed where the Prophet said he didn't believe in Eternal sunship right all right then if we don't believe in Eternal sunship for Jesus then we've got to understand the godhead amen and to realize that Jesus was called a Son of God yeah but he was not God the son that's trinitarianism he was called a Son of God right see in no way am I trying to destroy our thoughts of the fact that we are Sons and Daughters of God Amen but just making sure we understand it's by the new birth that we come to that position all right then see if I don't believe in Eternal sunship for Jesus I don't believe in Eternal sunship for you and I I believe eternal life living in you and I makes us the children of God now if you want to call us Sons and Daughters that's fine because that's that's just terminologies that's what I was saying about when Nicodemus looked or not NE Nebuchadnezzar looked down in he said we throw three in there in Daniel 3 verse 25 he said we throw three in and said there's four down he said one of them is like or got the form the Son of God Amen well it's like I was trying to tell you in a sensible point he looks down and he knows that they hated they heated that thing seven times harder that even killed the ones that throw them in and if you look down in a hole like that it was burning and blazing and you seen three that you throw it in and if they were not even singed or or anything you know they're walking around you and then you look around and you see a fourth person there with anybody with one eyed in high sense his brother Don ruddle it was a good statement he made used to say you'd know then that that would have to be almighty God to take care of those other three well if he's almighty God and you can see him then you'd call him a Son of God right do you understand right Nebuchadnezzar called him a Son of God all right see then that a way you look at it and you see him and every how that we don't believe in Jesus be in Eternal sunship we've got to believe the same way well how is it that Jesus wasn't was not an eternal son because he was God made manifest in a human vessel amen right right and you could call him the son right why because you could see God he said if you seen me you've seen the father that's right all right so then but he it's not an eternal sunship because Sons always have a beginning the human flesh of that man we call Jesus had a beginning but that soul and that spirit inside of that man never had no beginning it was eternal God so then God didn't send a son you remember that he came himself all right are we still in the message the prophet said he came himself all right so then how is it that he he would be who he is is the same way you and I are who we are am the only difference was he Soul and Spirit was eternal we come into the world Body Spirit and soul lost amen oh of course if you believe you come into the world with eternal life in your soul now look what a situation you got right you got to admit the soul is lost right amen I mean you got to admit that I mean in one out in high sense figure that out you got to admit it well if you're lost but yet you got eternal life now how can you be lost and have eternal life I don't have no education I'm sorry I got a ninth grade education that's all I was able to get I work for a living but listen how could you have an eternal sinner sister Gail if you're a sinner and you then but you have eternal life you're an eternal sinner I mean languages Ain ain't messed up too bad right that's as plain as it can be amen but why is it that people believe it that way that's right I came with this eternal life quotes yeah they've got quotes but what are you doing with quotes you're killing yourself why is it they're doing away with the Simplicity of the messag the prophet said go on with the same simple message or else you'll work yourself away from it well why can't we just stay with the same simple message I believe you must be justified Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost that is the new birth and that's the only way you have eternal life but once you receive that eternal life that eternal life is a part of God Amen and that eternal life was always Eternal right it's just a time that I wasn't Eternal yes what brother Dale oh brother so and so preaches that and it's just it's just so great and he's so sweet to till I just get excited about who I was and what I am and what I'm sorry you know you're stuck with me like it is I just don't have no other way of presenting other than just telling you what I believe amen amen and just say that's the way it goes whether you like it or not see God appeared in many forms right but there's only one person of God right right that's right I see then we don't believe in Eternal sunship he appeared in a form called a son but that was just a form that was just words or terms to be used because you can't have eternal sunship right but you can have eternal godship that's what the prophet said all right but think about it now if there's only one true and living God then then we don't believe in Eternal sunship for him then we truly don't believe in Eternal sunship for us right the Bible says as he is so are we in this world all right you said well what do you believe then brother Dale I believe the eternal life that God has always was eternal and I believe it may be different than what a lot of people tried to explain but did God choose us to be his children I asked someone this the other day did he choose us to be his children you better listen now sounds good doesn't it he chose me to be be his child did he choose you to be his child no or was you always his child that's right you see why I preached Eternal sunship in that position because I knew most of your minds would be running back into the form of saying brother Dale if you believe the children of God are God made manifest then you're going to run me into an eternal sunship thought and that's not true that's why I preached it first you can't have eternal sunship you understand the point of asking the question did God actually choose us to be what we are are we his offspring amen which one is it if we're his offspring he never chose for us to be his children he had children right amen well hell then then that push us back there now the children he has is the same children he is right amen he's Eternal amen his children are Eternal we just had to come into this world for it to be an impartation into these human vessels we look at right you said well I hadn't thought of it like that well maybe you ought to think is a child of God a second person from God that's all the simple questions I ask are you a child of God being different from God well then you don't have eternal life cuz you're moving yourself away from it but if you're an offspring of God if you're a child of God and that doesn't mean the children of was running around up in there you talk I'm talking about eternal life amen right wouldn't a bunch of us people running around up in heaven that's Mormon doctrines those are not true we were not there we'll get to it tonight we were there only as an attribute right right and attributes are the thoughts of God right there was no people back there he was self-existing but he existed with his attributes you agree amen I don't ask you to I'm just saying he existed with his attributes he existed with his thoughts and God's thoughts are eternal the prophet said that gives an eternal quality to the elect why can't we simply believe CU remember now we're up be we're back by the way of the Prophet message we're back in God's mind we'll move back over in another message or two and start down through time and see how for knowledge and predestination gets involved and how the seed gets involved and and what all of that is but what I'm trying to get you and I to look at tonight is one thing I believe in an eternal God I believe in Eternal godship but not an eternal sunship am whether it be you me or whether it even be Jesus because Jesus was a Son of God only in the basis that God was manifested in that flesh and he was called a son amen why do you think they killed him come on why did they kill Jesus what did what did they say you're a man making yourself God no it was God making himself a man they just had it backwards in it but still they killed him because of who he was saying he was he wasn't saying he was a second person he was saying that he was God manifested in flesh that's why they killed him so will they do it again the end time and right now they're not trying to kill you they're going they're trying to kill your influence but they'll come down to even killing you for it see my point was trying to get up to us I don't believe in Eternal sunship for Jesus Christ and I don't believe in Eternal ship for you and I but I believe in a God that has given eternal life to a people amen that's right but that eternal life was in him in the beginning that was his offspring so I ask you the question again did God choose for us to be his children are are we his children by having eternal life am which one is it if he chose us to be his children that's predetermining right so you done got back in your predestination Doctrine right come on if he sat back before the world and looked down even and saw like people try to make that's my children then he was predetermining the prophet of God we went through message after message after message that he don't predestinate by his desires that's right amen he predestines by your desires and my desires whether we desire to be saved or not it's why he gave us a free moral agency right amen they won't deal people that that are in their Eternal sunship I mean excuse me or not I said it that way but that's what they're in when you get into these predestination doctrines and I really didn't mean to say that now so don't think I was trick saying it when you get into predestination doctrines and you predetermining something then you're going to have to go to sunship with it come on you got sense think it over you're going to have to go to sunship and when you go to sunship you're going to go to Eternal sunship you don't believe brother Dale that we come into the world with eternal eye no amen emphatically no amen if you did Jesus Christ died in vain you destroyed the whole Bible in the prophet's message of course we want everything after 63 you can't understand this message if you don't understand up to 63 amen and then understand what he's talking about right but see that's the way people are all right see I believe then by the new birth I believe on the day of Pentecost that there was 120 Little Seeds the prophet said spoken words Original Seed we'll get back to this pulled up into the upper room waiting what were they waiting on if there always was eternal what was they waiting on why was they scared to death they waser coming out of that upper room right that's right but when the Holy Ghost fell they went right out why because it brought them eternal life you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the prophet of God said what is the gift of the Holy Ghost he said eternal life through Jesus Christ there's no way to get eternal life outside of Jesus Christ cuz he was almighty God see then we are the children of God which means that we are his offspring we are his offspring he said don't think it man's filter it could not be well go ahead let's do that number two let's read it cuz I want to get that point pull up number two that's e 12 of thirsting for Life 1957 he said talking about the facts of our faith the book you know and they use the word of Eternal sunship of God the word don't even make sense to me the word Eternal means eternity which had no beginning or has no end and Son means had a beginning so how could it be it could be a Eternal godship watch him but never an eternal sunship a son is one that's begotten of so it had a beginning you say well but Brother D you you're confusing me because I always thought I was I thought people were were Sons and Daughters of God Amen if you're born again right well now now you're saying you don't believe in any I don't believe in Eternal sunship I believe in Eternal godship I believe it's a prophet of God said I gave it to you there he said I believe in Eternal godhead right well that's father son holy ghost that it's father son well that that's got to mean this no those are the manifestations of God that we'll get to in a minute those are the form of God there was a time when he was father there was a time when he was son there's a time now the Holy Spirit that's father son Holy Ghost cu the Bible said in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily so I believe in Eternal godhead right right because I believe that son that came out from God in the beginning that your Prophet explained is the lost to speech the one who created I believe that was almighty God in another form not an eternal son sent out to speak was eternal God in another form when Jesus stood right there on Earth he said unless you believe that I am he you will die in your sins oh no they just had to believe in Son of God that wouldn't what he was talking about that he he was talking about unless you believe that I am almighty God that's what I said that's why they killed him they knew what he was saying they also knew that he was trying his best to tell them that they were not Eternal at that time but yet they believe they were done been through that they believe they were Eternal because they were the chosen of God but that's where people don't believe the way I believe it I'm sorry that's all right I don't believe Those Old Testament Saints had eternal life in their soul right yet I was looking at one today where brother R was talking about well um you believe that U Saul was saved he said well sure I do right I believe Saul was saved MH but what was was the Salvation back then if they had eternal life why did they have to go to paradise why did they not go straight into the presence of almighty God right that's right they had to go to paradise to wait until Jesus Christ came see you just make eternal life just a it out just giving it to well they got it the got it that got it eternal life is a person it's the person of almighty God Amen and they couldn't have that eternal life until that man come to Earth we called Jesus and within him was that eternal life and it was released at Calvary when it was released at Calvary it came back on them on the day of Pentecost and then they had eternal life right then the eternal life they had always was eternal right right that was God's Offspring starting out that was the expanding of God Amen not into sunship right listen what he says in the next one go ahead try to stay with my notes if I can all right it's hard to do look at number three just look at the things he says 1962 401 of course I know that's back before the seals was preached and the prophet was wrong but no we're not saying he was wrong we just say he didn't understand well according to my understanding now sorry I thought he was born the prophet I thought the word was to come to the prophet I didn't know it was to come to you and me only by way of the Prophet amen that's right that's right but yet that's the way people are see they always want to straighten something out I'd like to ask the question how many of you can make any sense out of Eternal sunship of God if he was a son he had a beginning if he was eternal son how could he be a son and be Eternal for a son is a product of something but if he was he was could not be an eternal son there's no such a thing Eternal Son of God because if if he never had a beginning then he cannot be nothing but Eternal but if he was a son he had a beginning so he cannot be an eternal son watch him it was the Eternal God manifested in a son right uh-huh Eternal God cuz God is the only thing that's Eternal Eternal God that's who Jesus Christ was that's why I said to people people don't understand the godhead they make Jesus the son of God a second person the first one I had to read and quote it to you the other day I want to ask you to pull it back but look what he says on the unveiling of God paragraph 77 and 78 64 61 uh 61 614 he poured himself out Christ in the people Christ in you he poured himself out God all the fullness all the godhead bodily was in this person Jesus Christ he was God and God Alone Now listen not a third person or a second person or a first person but the person God veiled in human flesh amen amen see cuz if he was the first person you call him that then that would give you the implication there could be more persons right see it's not true then all right look where we're at where' we get two number three right go on to number four I want to get these out of the way back onto your mind see now this is one where we go after the seals with it to make sure people just want to understand that you know 63 804 calling Jesus on the scene paragraph 4647 and when you Catholic people say Eternal ship sunship where did you get such a word it doesn't make sense to me how can he be Eternal and be a son now this is 63804 that's after the seals right so he still got the same point how can he be Eternal and be a son a son is something that's begotten of and how can it be Eternal Eternal never did begin it never does end so how could it be Eternal sunship oh my if these denominations hasn't scrupled things up I'll stop right there because that's my point the denominations in the message is scrupled it up that's right that's right okay but listen we're going to go through tonight because if we don't finish tonight we'll finish it Sunday see I believe and I've always taught you that God never gained attributes as he came down or condescended that he always had the attributes in him but they were not made manifest he didn't gain attributes coming this way he dis displayed his attributes he always was a Healer but there was nobody sick he always was a savior but there was nobody to be saved but still he had the attributes all right what are the attributes of God what are they God has three attributes father son Holy Spirit Holy Ghost either which way you want to use it he has three attributes all right he has many forms now that those three attributes can be displayed in but there's still just three attributes of God father son Holy Ghost all right now if we can find some way that you and I are a part of those attri rutes I believe in the attributes of God are Eternal and not every time you want to use attribute because he said you're an attribute of your father you're attribute of your mother but get the point what are the attributes of God so everything that we receive here in life comes from one of those three attributes or all of them together either way you want want to State it that's up to you because all of those attributes are the same person we just read it there's only one person there's only one God and he has attributes he had those attributes before the world ever begun the prophet says on Christ a mystery of God reveal we went through that he had a plan and a purpose that he was going to achieve in order to let himself be expressed right so what are the attributes of God the attributes of God let's just let the prophet answer it look at number five is to make sure you get all of this and keep it straight this is taken from works as Faith Express 65 11:26 paragraph 204 and remember you're in a cycle of three but you're one person like father son Holy Ghost cycle of three but one person three attributes of the same God father had three offices like fatherhood sunship Holy Ghost and your body Spirit Soul all right three attributes okay we got the three attributes just in case somebody out there doesn't know these things all right look to the next one se's not a with a shook 65 paragraph 33 run it on up because the other part you can read it see this all God all all alone God manifesting himself working himself through through different ages so those three of Father Son and Holy Spirit same God working in three attributes and we today are one the church itself an attribute of God's thinking before the word foundation of the world to have a church so that those which are in Christ was in Christ at the beginning that was his thoughts and his thoughts is his attributes now the prophet said he dwelt alone with his thoughts he was self-existing if you put us back there in any form other than the eternal life that we have look what you've just done he would not be self-existing amen and remember he stayed self-existing even after he created the angels that only made him God he was still self-existing until he created man in Genesis 1:26 and 27 all right you see what it was we are the attribute of God let me ask you a question you ever been healed it was his attribute are you saved am that's his attribute it's his attributes now that's what we're covering tonight what are the attributes of God they're the thoughts of God what are the thoughts of God they're his attributes so he dwelt alone we wasn't with him in any form other than that eternal life that he has and that was his children his offspring but not back there in any form to where we could even connect to an eternal sunship we were only back there in his thinking in his mind we've covered those messages over and over God dwelt Alone he was self-existing so that mean he's dwelt by himself with the times he was dwelling by himself or wherever he was by himself before anything ever appeared he already had attributes right and that's the eternal life you receed by the new birth he's just making us hear what that eternal life was there brother D do you believe we were back there we were back there only as attributes am now here's one that I'd suggest you right down or calculate in your mind and keep it we're going to have to get over a long ways before we start talking about the connection to the Earth and life and the morning star sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy it's going to take a while to get to there so while we're thinking about think about eternal life and then you'll see why the prophet would say if you have eternal life amen you always was eternal am right if you have it he said if you don't have it you're not Eternal and never will be if you don't receive it all right so then what are the thoughts of God what are we we're an attribute of God's thinking before the foundation of the world to have a church so those which are in Christ was in Christ at the beginning that was his thoughts and his thoughts as his attributes so now there's nobody there he's by himself his children were within him they were just part of eternal life if he was eternal not his people sitting around inside of him here there they draw it out remember the two Soul people remember them how they draw it out they put these dots and these circles and these things and and all and you happened to be here you was all right but if he was over here you couldn't get saved and same old doctrines still today listen look what he goes on to say on a message called a shame 1965 711 and I hope you will pay attention that all of these quotes that I'll be using the rest of the message 90% of them is after the seals broke so you know that's where the people say he increased in his message to understand I can show you back in the 50s where he understood right oh no message of Shame 1965 711 and I said what would you do if you were sitting in a meeting and seen God the Holy Spirit which is the only God there is working amongst the people God in the fatherhood the pillar of fire and the prophets god listen now watch what he's saying God in the Father the pillar of fire and the prophets God and his son than God and his people covers a pretty good lot of ground doesn't he it's just attributes of God one great God who covers eternity right so it's the attributes you are the attribute of your father but there's no way you could remember being in your father and especially no way you could have any connection to your grandfather because in your grandfather you was not a germ he was only a gene in the DNA makeup right right only through the bedding ground of Mother and Daddy in the to that could he be father in the fact of it coming to a germ or a sperm but that's only the natural story butale do you believe in Eternal sunship no right do you believe in Eternal God yes I believe God is eternal and if you have eternal life the eternal life we have is God's own life that he gave for you and I right amen a court trial 1964 412 paragraph 257 there is no three or four Gods there's only one God there is three attributes of God Father Son and Holy Ghost but they're not three Gods he said that's heathenism see there is only one God and that's attributes God the father was in the wilderness and he goes down explaining coming down attributes we're seeing those attributes displayed going to the next one sir we would see Jesus 64318 paragraph 8182 in the beginning God was not even God he was the great Eternal and there were attributes attributes was his thoughts and then then means at that time or shortly thereafter Webster says it and then he became a word like this the word express well a thought expressed is a word and a word expressed is a thought and then remember if you ever was in God's thinking you'll always be there if you got eternal life you are the expression or the ATT rute of his thought for this age right that's who we are look at the next one God is identified by his characteristics 64 311 paragraph 19 and the whole thing is the great Eternal eternity never did begin and never can end therefore in this great Eternal one was attributes to be father to be son to be savior to be healer and these things was in him and only things that's happening now is a displaying his attributes that's all that's happening now look at the next one proving his word 64816 paragraph 180 181 through 182 and there stood the priest said this man is Bells above see no representation right he had no representation the little woman at the whale had representation from predestination we'll get to that that's why she would say that that you're the Messiah you know that Prophet whereas they would call him belba eternal life you always what see you have eternal life there's only one form of it that's God you were his attribute he thought of you and knowed you before the foundation of the world in his mind see but there's no representation in Heaven by the priest there wasn't in God's thinking at all but the woman was we'll get back to these things we're definitely not through with the message if you get bored with what we're talking about then maybe you're through with the message look at this one there thinking man's filter 1965 822 paragraph 71 through uh 71 yeah it's 71 excuse me but when you're born to the spirit of God of course if you believe you come into the world with eternal life you don't need to be born again the Born Again experience to those that that come Eternal would only be a knowledge of who you are and Nicodemus had that the Jesus said you must be born again see this is 65 now and when you're born of the spirit of God then you got you're a Son of God and you always was a Son of God and you always will be a Son of God no way to separate it because it you have eternal life and eternal life never did begin neither will it ever end see if you have eternal life there's no way that that this comes in Us by the new birth is eternal sunship or any form it's God in another form called the holy ghost that comes and lives in our hearts to make us Eternal or to bring to us what we were that's no problem with me have no problem we're saying that the eternal life that I have was in God before the world begun and has now been given to me and he bringing me to the knowledge of an understanding of who I am amen and that's what your Prophet said he said when the bride realizes who she is and what she's here for said she'll be gone right now look what he says in who is this Mel chdc this will be quite a bit of reading so hold on in the beginning God dwelt Alone with his attributes as I spoke of this morning that's his thoughts there was nothing just God alone but he had thoughts now that's simple enough there was nothing let's see what was that man said that time nothing from nothing will leave nothing so nothing is as far as you can go because if you go anything pass nothing you're coming back to something so nothing is nothing God dwelt Alone is any problem with that yeah but but but now here's what but brother Dale When The Morning Star saying together in the sons of God Shadow for joy we was back there then don't you agree wait till we get to the message and you'll see as I said be careful when you start dealing with predestination you better deal with for knowledge first there could have been no Morning Star sing together and sons of God shouted for Joy had they not been God's attributes in him before the world ever begun and remember when that comes into being the sons of God shouting for Joy the cherubims had already been created the Angels so then God had done started condescending because that's what it says the morning Stars which are the cherubims Angels so it's already started this way that's what I said we're back over here now let's just stay over there for a little while and just read what your Prophet has to say about these things all right he dwelt alone with his attributes as I spoke of this morning that's his thoughts there was nothing just God alone but he had thoughts drop on down reading you can read the whole thing and don't worry about reading all of it cuz it'll be there paragraph 48 notice those who have eternal life was with him and in him in his thinking before there ever was an angel star cherubim or anything else that's Eternal and if you have eternal life you always was then what did he say not your being here but the shape and form that the infinite God so we wasn't back there in any shape form or fashion no one say was back there was eternal life right and remember listen to what he thinks about you now remember the point okay then when we read this remember the point he was saying he dwelt alone then he begins to describe his offspring he said well that's putting us back there is it and remember you your eyes your stature whatever you was you were in his thinking at the beginning just remember that's his thinking he didn't say we were back there as persons peoples if he had children he ought to know what his children look like the only thing that you are is the expression word after he thought it he spoke it and you you are if it isn't you wasn't in his thinking there is no way at all for you ever to be there for he is the one that gives eternal life he wouldn't in you thinking then you'll never be there come on you say well that makes him predetermined determining nope you get on down later he just makes everybody and gives them a choice right come on we're not lost remember how he read the scriptures not him that willth or him that runneth but God and that his predestination might stand true he could choose before any time who God is Sovereign in his choosing did you know that God is sovereign so he could choose now you got him contradictory to himself when he said he didn't choose now what are you going to do with it the prophet says he doesn't choose by his own desires he doesn't predestinate to make sure the word is correct by his own desires now he's talking about something look like it's predestinated by his choosing so ask you the question again did God set back before the world and choose people to be his children or has he set back before the world were his children a part of him now which one is it that way I don't have to back off I don't have to say brother Rand was right here and wrong here they both tied together you see a preacher start saying brother random must have misunderstood here or didn't know here or just need to correct him here here something you got a problem yeah I'll just put it in plain language that preacher don't have eternal life cuz if you had eternal life he wouldn't be that dumb sorry but listen even your eyes your stature but is he talking about this thing that you're looking at or is he talking as the Prophet said that God took a picture of you and I when he said oh about 18 years old that's a good one but keep on reading when did he say he took the picture before the foundation of the world and your name was written in the lounge book of life before the foundation the world but he said maybe not your name you have might not be Freda right follow me let's keep on going we got a little time look what he says God's provided place of worship 65 425 paragraph 38 so if he's infinite and he does not do that because he is is perfect in every word he never utters a word unless it's Eternal now that's wonderful all of his eternals now I like that all of his eternals was with him at the beginning that's a good statement his thoughts his attributes and they're only expressing themselves in the world today well to the next God who is rich in Mercy 65 11 11 119 now if you've got eternal life tonight if we have eternal life then we was always were that's wonderful if you have it but what if you don't have it because there's only one form of eternal life you always were and the reason we were because we are a part of God and God is the only thing that's Eternal never remember the message part of God couple of weeks ago part of God that's what I was preaching there is what I'm preaching now a part of God is his offspring right his attributes and that's what you and I are not peoples back there with him attributes his thoughts his children okay now we are a part of God you always was you don't remember it because you're only an attribute you because you were only an attribute in God you were only in his thinking no problem your very name if you ever was on the book of life it was put there before the foundation of the world he knew what you were you don't know who you are you don't know who you are you are not going to be but now you are the sons of God see always were the sons of God now does that destroy you know do going to run you said while ago we wasn't the sons of God I explain what a son is a son is God himself in another form called a son that's what he's talking about here he's not going away for when God had you in his thinking at the beginning you have to be some part of you your life that's in you now had to be with God before there well when he before he even became material here on Earth before there was anything but God you were one of his attributes he knowed what your name would be he know the color of your high would be would have he knowed all about you the only thing happened is when you being a sinner in other words you drop on down you come down here to Center all right now lean not to your own understanding 1965 120 so you see if you were in the for knowledge of God okay now back to forn knowledge he can use for knowledge any way you want he's talking about eternal things and using for knowledge because it's no problem with him no problem with me because I understand what he's talking about so you see if you were in the forn knowledge of God then you are becoming a part of God see drop to Earth for knowledge you're now what becoming a part of God but he just got to explaining that you were already a part of God what is he talking about us realizing here who we are us coming to an understanding of who we are right we're not children of Jesus that that was a Son of God we're God's Offspring we had to have it by the new birth but that new birth makes us Eternal look what he has to say about us the only way you can be a Son of God or a daughter of God you had to be part of God and God isn't complete without you I love that statement right has to be that's right because there's only one only one resource of eternal life and that is God and him alone has eternal life now and you were a part of him in so much that you're an attribute or in his thinking in the beginning and that because he thought of you in the beginning it gives that little tug towards him I get back to that I've got some quotes laying over to the side how that brother R talks about you know how that you uh said don't you some don't you remember that that when all the other kids was out running and scrumping and and doing things wrong and said you uh you felt bad and didn't do it little tug I have no problems with that it's just a long ways down the road of course of course that's where people they think you get exalted and I've told you how many times have I made this statement that even when I was a sinner I would go do wrong and go home and feel dirty and repent cuz you see I met God when I was 11 years old but not as a new birth how many times have you heard that that's not garbage or not talking that's fact it's not tonight to be told you this church has heard it for 40 years right it's not a new thought don't make nothing out of me make something out of him all right in so much that you're an attribute in his thinking in the beginning and that because he thought of you in the beginning it gives that little tug towards him because if he thought of you in the beginning now we're going to get down to where that brother brandom says it like this he says what kept you from being killed well it looks like you're getting somewhere back into something that bothering me well I hope it bothers you enough for you to pray eternal life is eternal life little tug toward you that's what makes it to be quick that's what has to be quickened some of them will never be be quickened they just don't have it that's all now did he choose some to be this and others to be something else no but if he had children go ahead to the next all right this one yeah let's see I had to put an A in there sorry about that I have to add in things once in a while you know shoot one in when I get here this is 13A 1965 11:26 Works say faith expressed the spirit can come down here and anoint you to do certain things and you do it but that don't mean you're saved think of it Kus prophesied Judas cast out Devils see the spirit anointed him the rainfalls on the just and the unjust the Wheats can Rejoice with the wheat but it's what it is at the core okay read on in between there and see what he's talking about the spirit can be there the real genuine Spirit the Holy Spirit can anoint you that still don't mean you're saved it's that inside Soul That Never Dies it's got eternal life it always was eternal life it come from God it goes to God it's the soul I believe in an eternal soul but only one Eternal Soul that's the soul of God that's why Genesis 1:26 and 27 brother BR said he made man m n not a man he didn't just make one part he made a theophany he said I believe you Soldier theophany that's another message go ahead to the next we'll get to that point about the soul and then you'll see I believe that his soul comes into you by the new birth that's what gives you eternal life me eternal life is when his soul comes into US amen right now things that are to be 65 the of your life spiritual life tonight now he's talking about Jean Jean remember the little story a while ago Jean when you was in your granddaddy you was a jean when you come into your daddy you were still a gene physically speaking until Mama and Daddy got together and it turned from that to a sperm or germ and then your physical body could come so remember what he's talking about the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in God the Father before there was even a molecule see and you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a Son of God now you're expressed after his word has come in you to light up this age after his word has come in you after you are expressing God's life in you because you are a son or a daughter of God therefore you get what I mean r it up God knew that you would be here because you have to be one of his genes or his attributes you had to be if you ever if you've got eternal life then it always was eternal life and God before there was a foundation of the world knew that you would be here and when the word are the water the washing of the water of the word fell upon you you it was expressed in a being this one come on now you have fellowship with your father just because you have just just as you have with your Earthly father to Fellowship okay come on let's go now we're back to 15 which is Serv as we would see Jesus and 64 now you were in his thinking at the beginning if you got eternal life life there is only one form of eternal life eternal life had no beginning it has no ending so if you have eternal life you were an attribute of God's thinking before there was anything but him if you have eternal life you always was eternal what the eternal life that you have and you always existed with him what not his peoples as attributes come on if you lost the whole message tonight attributes we were in his thoughts you in God's thinking before there's anything but him your form your shape and what you are now is just a negative it's just a negative part of life go ahead to the next God's power of transformation Sons and Daughters of God was in God at the beginning now look you've got eternal life you say well we believe it that we got eternal life well there is only one form of eternal life and that's God's that's God that's the only thing that is now that's how easy it is to change what brother around says you say there is only one form of eternal life and that's God's so you put it no no and there is only one form of Eternal that's God entirely difference in what you're saying come on that's the only thing thing that is eternal is God and if you got eternal life that life that's in you always was if you got eternal life and you were in the loins of God before there even was a world all right you died with him etc etc now you can fellowship with him you couldn't back there because you were just a word in him a seed we'll get to that Jesus Christ was God himself manifested because he was the son because he was begotten but it was just a tabernacle for him to live in no man has seen God at any time but the only begotten of the father has declared him go to the next identifications of Christ in all ages may I break it down in the beginning it was eternal it wasn't even God our God our English word God is a is an object of worship but he there wasn't nothing to worship him he was just the eternal now would you remember this point he was not God until he created the Angels right so then his word God was not there just or back in there it was not made manifest until the Angels worshiped him so don't put us back there or something running around worshiping you got to come this way before you can start to worship form of morning Stars sang together in him was attributes anyone knows what an attribute is in other words in him was his thoughts just thoughts that's his attribute then his word and a thought expressed is a word in the beginning was a word before it wasn't even expressed it was a thought attributes in this thinking he was to be God probably C what's in this thinking he was to be God probably created the Angels first and he was worshiped he was God and then in him was attributes to be father to be son to be savior nothing lost something had to be lost so there had to be a way made for that to be healer nothing sick so he had so he had something that to get sick so he could heal it it's only displaying his attributes right come on okay what's the next the invisible Union of the BR of Jesus Christ 1965 11:25 he was only the manifestation of the attributes of God for he was the son of God any problem with that he was called a son but he was God himself he was the attributes of God and any son is the attributes of his father and just as you were in the genes of your father in the body of your father when you was a young boy you were in him yet he could not have Fellowship ship with you because he didn't know you but then through the bedding ground of a mother you were brought forth into the Earth and become in the image of your father then he could fellowship with you and so were you sons of God sons of God and Daughters of God before there even was a Moon Star or molecu you were Sons and Daughters of God no problem with that is it Four Angels come into being the eternal life that you have already was in being okay so you're Sons and Daughters of God even before there's moon or Star you're only the physical manifestation of the attributes that was in God at the beginning for there's only one form of eternal life and that was you before you don't know nothing about it neither did you know when you were in your fa Earthly father but you are manifested to In His Image in the image of God you are made and you were manifested for the glory and the fellow and The Fellowship Of God therefore as sure as your Gene had to be in your father before your natural birth your spiritual Gene had to be in God because you're an expression of the attributes of his think attributes of his thoughts before the foundation of the world we're just displaying it going let's catch the next couple we'll be through now look what he says but I want you to get this what does imorphia mean God changes his form right God changes his form now Satan is not an imorphia of God right you know what I mean Judas Etc people of the Lost cannot be imorph IM morphe means god changed his form so the very God in the beginning changed his form and started condescending to bring you and I into manifestation upon the Earth that was his purpose and Joel 280 promised that in this last days there would be a latter of rain poured out upon the people in the last days I think the Greek word there is kyos which means that he emptied himself out not in the way that we would say like something was inside of somebody that he emptied out but he poured himself out he changed his imorph he changed from what he was to what he is he never changes his nature but on the day of Pentecost he changed himself from being the son of man to the Son of God he came not with the people he came in the people come on he came into people where I he changed his form he came not with the people he came in the people see the same God to carry his ministry on through in this great age the same God imorph into you and I it just changed his form we're not a son of God in the bases of a son like our word son means beginning we are God made manifest by the new birth God in morphe get the last one who is this mes it he said it's been hid notice like the scripture he hides with a mask over it that's what God has done to this age now watch here we are it's been hid all these things has been hid and it's supposed to be revealed in this age now the Bible says they will be revealed in the latter times it's like a sculpture keeping his piece of work all covered over until the time he takes the mask off of it and there it is and that's what the bi the Bible has been it has been a work of God that's been covered up and it's been hid since the foundation of the world it's seven and it's Sevenfold mystery and God promised in this day at the age of this lady of in church he would take the mask off the whole thing and we could see it what a glorious thing God in morphe mask in the pillar of fire god in morphe in a man called Jesus God in morphe in his church God above us God With Us and God in us the condescending of God Amen it's not you and I folks it's God you said well you're just making too much of us you making too much of us where have I made anything I just read what the prophet said please explain to me where I've made anything other than what he said but yet see people they're not going to listen to you no matter what you say and and I'm not trying to convince anybody else I'm trying to convince you and I those that are on internet are only listening they are not this church they have an ability to listen they are somehow out there that call this their church and their tith here but if you don't send your tith here then you're not part of this church you're just listening so help yourself that's fine I don't want you money all I want to do is try to preach the truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen and if we walk alone we walk alone that's right that's no problem you see church I I believe not an eternal sunship but an eternal godship I believe God has manifested himself in his attributes I believe the eternal life that you have in you now by the new birth that you had to receive right always was eternal show me where the Prophet said you did not have to receive eternal life well what do you mean he he said you always was if you always was you have to receive now that's as carnal as anything could be that's PL dumb stupid and everything you could think of see you're just trying to use words I was trying to use words I quit that about 40 years ago and I've been trying to preach Jesus Christ I believe in Eternal God I believe it that God's children existed with him before the world ever begun before an angel or anything ever come into being God's children existed with him but only as his attributes not as people not as identities and may I say it again then did he choose for us to be his children you're going into predestination you're predetermining and leaving the others out or are we his children the eternal life that we have in us now is the only children I'm talking about and to do that we must have the new birth that's right yes because the only way you can have eternal life is through Jesus Christ am you say yeah but wait a minute Brother D we got you now okay have you the scripture we've read many times says that we were chosen in him I preached a message off of that remember and I asked you the question about being chosen in him I said which one is it were we chosen or were we chosen in him a lot of difference a lot of difference in being chosen many are called few are chosen there a lot of difference between being just a chosen as to being chosen in him I said then it's not concerned to me whether or not I'm chosen right it's whether or not he was chosen we know he was so it's no problem but you got the point he was chosen I was chosen in him in other words I have the same eternal life that he had he had to die to release that life could come back in you and I so we were chosen in him but when you start bringing him into being remember you already got the Book of Life dealing with it I hope you understand let's stand together I'm just trying my best to as brother B said not to call create a Doctrine but straighten out Doctrine and if I'm wrong i' I'd like to see it somewhere where it you know because all of the quotes that people are wanting to use I've used them tonight there's only two times in the prophet's message that he said you always was eternal I used one of them tonight I might have used both of them not going use one that's just like you hear all of these things you say well we had this seed laying dormant in us I want a quote for that but yet have to say brother Brown said it lay dormant in I want to quote for it you've heard it all your life right then it lay dormant I want a quote for it you got the computer go home and run dormant run dormant in your computer when you get home and see if brother randam ever said that we had a seed laying in us that was dormant he talks about the seed of the age he talks about the things of life is dormant because it had not come into manifestation but I want one where he says he laid in you as dormant see we quote things a lot of times thinking brother ROM said it and you better remember what we said to start with see the word dormant if you're going to use it it means lifeless if you got a seed laying in you lifeless and yet you still saying that you've got eternal life in your soul that en is not sensible to the human mind but yet it's preached as Revelation and people shout all over the house I'm sorry really I am sorry for not being able to go along with a lot of other people cuz I'm a human being but I want the people to have an opportunity to hear about Jesus Christ in the correct way whether you like me or not we get over on that other side there won't be no argument about them Egos and things we talked about the other day then it's like sister said the other day she said listen to somebody coming up preaching about predestination she said thank God for the truth well that's all I got to say thank God for the truth what do we got 392 in the red book 392 in the red book anybody have a need Saints of th Proclaim Jesus the light of the world life and Mer Mercy in his name Jesus
