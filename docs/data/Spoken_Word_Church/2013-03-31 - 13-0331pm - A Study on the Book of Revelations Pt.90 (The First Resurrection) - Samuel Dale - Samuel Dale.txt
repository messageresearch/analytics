TRANSCRIPT
========================================
is somewhere they turned on me me without jesus oh foreign is is it just i you just brother ricky marlow's gonna come crazy dude for when he was on the cross i was on his mind me oh love was on his face his eyes he looked ahead in time i was i'm he was on the cross i was on his mind yet when he was on the ground i was on his mind jesus oh hallelujah is david beauty glory amen is me oh right praises amen we went to funeral the other day just thought about it might be an equal for parents you know sharing with their children and this young lady was up talking about her mama and she said her mama told her every time that she was going out on a date or anywhere she tell the kids she says now remember you're a son or a daughter of a king and act like amen think about that i thought that was pretty good open the eyes of my heart amen amen this morning revelations 1 and revelations 20. just remember now that we had we put our easter festival time over a week because we're wondering about the bad weather and everything and so we're gonna have this coming weekend so remember that and come be with us the sign up sheet is downstairs make sure you sign up where we know how much food to get what to do and also just remember that we'll start at two o'clock and we'll eat at five and then we'll have our bible study at six and we got a good place to be on the inside you know for the word if it is cool or rainy or whatever we can have it inside and by the way i'm sure you heard karen say that it hurt his feelings it really did because it was gonna cost him about three or four hundred dollars putting down gravel all over the place and then it was gonna cost him a whole lot of work getting all over the place cleaned up so it really did hurt his feelings that was a sure thing so you know you can sympathize with him just remember that and come and be with us we'll have our bible study time there let's see what are we still on the room bible study right supposed to be on adoption i knew we were supposed to be on one of them but i didn't know what exactly yet adoption so come and be with us and just have a good time in the lord and we we generally get to a couple of hours and just fellowship together you know and all so we'll be doing that there instead of having to come here meant so remember that remember the sick among us i know you the announcement little mark was sick there and brother boyd said this one says janet's sick so there's a lot of sicknesses among us and well i'm glad for her to be here this afternoon you know just a lot of a lot of things remember brother richard wilson talking to him this morning and he's still having problems with his kidneys and they're going to have to you know go and do some exams on him and things and i think i think it's about the 15th of april so just remember that and be much in prayer for him you know any other announcements i generally forget as i said if you want to bring cakes and stuff and whatever you want to bring to the to the uh gathering we will sure try our best to devour it and take care of everything that you bring so we'll have a good time in that amen our lord jesus our savior for all in all thank you for being all of these things unto us thank you for this day lord that we celebrate and say that we have a resurrection time but our resurrection time is all year round 24 hours a day seven days of the week because we are truly a part of the resurrection we pray now that as we try to speak a little bit about this if you would just come among us and have your way lord in our hearts and our lives and forgive our sins and cleanse us and bless each one remember the sick among us touch each one lord that you may be the deliverer and the healer and all you said you sent your word but we believe it lord and we thank you for it just have your way now and keep us in jesus name amen revelations 1 1 2 3 the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to shew into his servant things which must shortly come to pass and he said and signified it by his angel and to his servant john who by a record of the word of god in the morning of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth what about that just being able to read you know blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand remember all the bible is written in a prophecy so because it's a great and wonderful ability to read isn't it and especially to know what these things mean that's the main thing to know what they mean revelations 20 and i saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and satan and bound him a thousand years and cast him into the bottomless pit shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should just he that he should deceive the nations no more till a thousand years should be fulfilled and after that he must be loose a little season and i saw thrones and they that set upon them and judgment was given unto them and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of jesus and for the word of god and which had not worshipped the beast nor his image neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with christ a thousand years he two times it already thousand years but the rest of the dead lived not again until a thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection best and holy is he that have part in the first resurrection on such the second death have no part but they shall be priests of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years four times now coming up number five and when the thousand years were expired satan should be loosed out of his prison when god says things on a repeated basis he means for us to understand or think about it right heavenly father we thank you we ask you now to just let our hearts and our lives be set on the resurrection we've done asking pray to you about it but we want one more time to just you just speak to us have your way now and guide us in jesus name you may be seated when god says something over and over it has a meaning to it the scripture there where it would say verily verily i say unto you you know very is enough but when he says verily verily it means listen when he says here and we've read what five or six times earlier it says a thousand years it means listen to think about that not to just um ponder it or wonder it or argue over as i say this morning a post millennials or a pre-millennialist or an all millennialist i never did understand the awe but they've got about three different millennial thoughts in there but you know to think about these things and to see that we will one day somebody's going to live a thousand years to prove the sin curse is gone now god don't have to do that he doesn't have to prove anything but he does it for you and i to be able to look at it and see the surety remember he even swore by himself now isn't that something to get something in other words for god to swear to you is is one thing and you know that's a great thing to stand on his promises but what about him swearing by himself that's that takes it into a deeper meaning if we would would understand you know and you know and and believe it but now we tried to cover this morning the the millennium and the thousand you know being the thousand-year reign and seeing that there would be a gospel to the heather and the prophet said during that millennial rain and that means we will have something or someone to rule and reign over not ruling ryan like uh hard things are being as i've brought out about the 144 thousand being the servants it doesn't mean servants in the basis of slaveries you know or somebody uh beaten if they don't do what they're supposed to do or whatever uh it's going to be a great utopia for a thousand years because it's recovered then satan is going to be bound he won't have anybody to work through his subjects brother and said will be in hell and that's the reason that he won't be able to do it he won't be able to work through and see if we could ever get it to the right place the prophet said one day he said they they asked him a question and you know and said i said brother brown you said that we could live so close to god that satan wouldn't know what to do with us he said that's right well you know you say but that's impossible for a human mortal well i remind you of a man that did not have the baptism of the holy ghost but yet he walked with god for the prophet say 500 years which you calculated in your own times there in genesis is 350 years and please god well now was every day so beautiful and wonderful and was he so you know holy and pious or what no he was a human being but he just had his mind on the lord he just thought about the lord and everything was involved and it was just tied up and about the lord you know well you know that would be great i mean like i've always said you know it'd be hard to to get mad at somebody when you're telling them that you love them when you don't ever tell the lord that you love him i mean you don't ever do that you don't ask the lord i love you if you cast me into hell i love you because you died for me you gave your life that i could live right amen the lord just tells me i love you uncle brother tom fox told me years ago he said that i love you and he said brother dale i want you to know if i don't love nobody i don't tell them i love them most of you that know brother tom know that that was the truth if he didn't love you he wasn't going to tell you he loved you well that's the way it ought to be with all of us you know about but we ought to be so much in love with the lord until no matter what he says or does right right around said it like this one day he said a no from god you know just find him saying no you can't have that he said that's wonderful because there's some reason you know that he knows about it and whatever we were like listening last night and i kind of got tickled it to him thinking about somebody else that had done it but he said they would own a we were coming from one place to another he said i've been there and he could he you've heard him tell so i can tell you every road from here to los angeles california and how long it'll take you to drive it you ever you know you've heard him say like that and he said him and the people got together and said they went i think 45 miles out in the wrong direction 50 miles or something out in the wrong direction you know he said but you know we don't know what we missed see that could have been some great disastrous thing taking place he said there we went all of us and he said i've traveled that road hundreds or something times is it the turn to go the wrong way well see that can be the hand of the lord taking care of us and we don't realize it well we just should go all the time then maybe that's the way you know giving him honor do you ever uh if i drop something in the grass and i'm looking for it and i find that you know what i do i say thank you lord you know why because i couldn't miss it and i found it just we need to thank him for everything and just be happy about it and not be well lord you owe me you know we should be happy and joyous or whatever to be because that should be the resurrection now they want to get to and talk about it okay now notice that we read here in the scriptures that it says that verse 5 and the rest of the dead live not again until the thousand years were finished and once this is the first resurrection now i want to get on to that in a minute now watch blessed and holy is he that have part in the first resurrection on which the second death or such the second death have no power now i want us to think about the the resurrection now i believe and you know i know you know when i say things a lot of times uh sometimes i'll say something and i think people even say that what people will say well brother they'll run around and say it that way i try to say everything that i can that he says and and give understanding and things like that as much as i know and forgive me for what i don't know but you know the resurrection is when jesus was standing on earth as we'll get to in a minute you know and he spoke of the resurrection that that wasn't a new doctrine that was a an old one for a long time see job even back before the writing of the of genesis as we know that job i believe now whether you whatever you know it's all right i believe job believed in a last day resurrection now i believe that because you read it yes see now when he come over and said i know my redeemer liveth he saw the person of the resurrection right he he didn't see maybe the dead raising the the uh the things transpiring and he said i know my redeemer liveth in the last days that stand up on the earth not see for myself and not another all right that was something about the resurrection that mankind didn't know or why would it be saying i know see and i'm trying to give understanding i believe every person has ever lived upon the earth you know in one way or the other has a thought of a resurrection uh the old ending with a happy hunting ground or or whatever you know it would be tied together with it and uh you know we talk about the parasites and the sadducees and and and all that we'll say well the pharisees believed in the resurrection but the sadducees didn't believe in the resurrection you know they say that's why they're sad well now i'm just honest i believe the sadducees believed in a general end time finishing up of resurrection why wouldn't they you know they studied the word that's right the pharisees you say well they got a great revelation about the resurrection well could it be that the pharisees had a little bit understanding of what job was talking about of a resurrection you know more than just a general resurrection and maybe it was the sadducees disbelieved in one of these days there was going to be a resurrection because they were quick to use that in their talking to jesus because remember the sadducees and the things they were quick to say oh now you know this man died his wife married again and they died and he met again and they died and said now in the resurrection said uh who's gonna be whose wife and husband you know i'm just telling you what i believe all right i believe all mankind believes in a final resurrection or something because why would you think about you know that when this ends what's done you know why why would anybody think that just because they die you know but that's the end well then why if that's the end why were some concerned and spoke of judgments throughout the world some spoke of condemnation right this resurrection spoke over the just there's resurrection spoke of in the bible of the of life there's a resurrection of damnation spoken up in the bible and see this i didn't choose to try to bring everything i just want you to think about a person said well well all i am i'll just die and i'm gone now you looking between the eyes and you say do you really believe that you know well why are you making preparations to live you know what is what our guys are over with you see that's just carnality of mankind thinking because if you think about that you are a human being no matter who it is hedonistics or whatever you know anybody agnostics idiots or whatever you think about it everybody has a hope within them right of something after this world see because why would you want to be a good person because if you die what's the need of somebody writing on an obituary what good is an obituary going to be sister gail that they're right sister gayle addison she gave a lot of money to this and you're dead and gone you don't you don't exist if that's what you believe me to everybody like the prophet said and you know his words he said everybody believes in a god no matter what they say they believe in a god of some form you know now that they're proving that the big bang theory is more conclusive they proved it was in the paper just the other day they proved it with their their abilities now and can tell you the world how old it is and everything they believe in a big bang theory and they believe that this whole universe that we're sitting in was no bigger than a fingernail on your finger and a lot of it's in the fingernail but you know you just read what they're saying but then you you have to analyze what they're saying that they're not talking about it was that small that was talking about it just comparison to what all the other stuff is but now listen i believe then that all believed in a resurrection of some form a time after this or a lie for something because that's the soul of man the soul of man believes in some form of a god if not they believe in their own self that they're god but that's still you know getting it to right all right see that i said job job was looking for a resurrection readiness read his writings earth before he gets over to saying i know my redeemer he's talking about a day coming a judgment or something or whatever but then when he saw i know see that brought down that meant that a person began to be talking about now if you don't get nothing out of message today you get one thing the resurrection is not a date a time a season or thought or idea or concept right the resurrection is a person amen all right now that's the only way you can explain how that he gets over in revelation here and it caused the millennium the first resurrection if you don't get it down as a person then you're missing it that's right so remember this morning brother around was talking about the millennium right around said the millennium jesus came with the millennium in him amen right you don't have to wait it was in him all right the resurrection was in him yes now follow that point i want to go slow but i'm just laying down a little bit ahead of you to think about so think about everybody believing in the resurrection read in a minute where the jews brothers have believed in a general resurrection all mankind as i said is believes that someday there will be something about something that'll happen that we'll raise and we'll have to give an account that's within the hearts and the thoughts of mankind all right now but we read here in the scripture that blessed is he that have part in there or is a partaker of the first resurrection because then he will have no part in the second resurrection see then the second resurrection is resurrection of all mankind going to the water on judgment right yes that is the second resurrection yes okay now blessed and holy is he that have part in the first because that way he'll have no part in the second that's what job began to see it was opening to him and he saw something about the resurrection and then he spoke he said and i'll see him for myself right right something personal all right now see the second resurrection is the dead going to the white throne judgment and that's what we ended up talking about satan this morning it needs to be loose for a little season what that consists of i don't know i've never heard the prophet explain how long that was it just said for a little season i do know what he said about it he said he'd be loosed together his subjects doesn't mean that he'll be loose to where he can raise the dead no the prophet wouldn't talk about that because satan can't do it but he would be loosed together as subjects because when the resurrection starts transpiring as i was saying this morning that god brings all mankind up in a resurrection satan said hey man i got it i wasn't able to control and do because i only had a few at my disposal you know or my ability in life but this mass multitude that is coming up all i got to do is get them on my side and you know out of that group that will be coming up a lot of them will be on his side but we read this morning he said his subjects was in hell he said well wait a minute now hell's not there's a hell right now but it's not a burning hell it's not this kind of hell or that time it's just a falling but it's the word hell because the word hell is hades show gahanna that refers to the grave it can refer to positional places etc now but when i'll get back and read it in a minute i want to quote it when martha said about lazarus she said he shall rise in the resurrection at the last days that's john 11 24. see she believed she believed that lazarus was going to raise one day but at that time their understanding was not even to the basis maybe of job so they were still just looking for a natural resurrection for a time that all would raise you know and they had assumed probably there'd have to be some form of judgments or whatever they would have to be answer because that's just the part of mankind that's the soul of mankind you know see he longs to to find his maker all right there's job lord said what joe wanted was for some man to be able to come that would take the hand of god and take his hand and pull them together well you know then he seen him he saw a man that would come and do that not physically maybe seeing him there he saw through revelation and he spoke by inspiration i know that my redeemer liveth all right now so here's martha in that same unregenerated position but yet knowing that up until this time maybe jesus hadn't spoke a lot about the resurrection other than thoughts and ideas that had been said and the pharisees had argued backwards and forth because they were arguing that point they were smart enough to say well you know whose wife will this be in the resurrections etc because all of those were thoughts and ideas and jesus had made maybe a lot of statements that they begin to think a lot but still she didn't see he was the resurrection right now you understand what i'm getting at yes she was still thinking about something else huh so they had all of that in mind and brother rather said all jews will believe in the resurrection let's look at this one go ahead brother number one this is believe us now this 1957 16 82 notice he said now i want you to read this real careful with me there's many of these but i chose this one because of the wording so thy brother shall rise again now let's straighten him up my brother shall rise again watch the old prophetic powers now coming right together the right place the right person the right time now watch it read with me she said i know my brother shall rise again you know he was waiting on somebody to say that uh we'll just read it and see where he was or not watch him watch the old prophetic powers now coming right together the right place lazarus was dead that's right they were in front of the tomb the right person martha right was the one to say it right the right time you remember the story he had been on going out away and they sent him word that lazarus was sick and he just kept going yeah finally he turns to go back and someone says well yeah you know he said listen lazarus is dead i'm gonna go raise him the right time right person right pla everything's gonna be right so when she said my brother's dead and in the grave see what our thoughts is and he just goes out there and says i'm on my way back i'm gonna raise the dead all right well what about mankind getting involved my brother is dead and in the grave but you if you'd have been here he wouldn't have died see she's beginning to see something she's beginning to see the resurrection all right but even now whatever you ask him god will do it she had her confidence in him yes right she believed that god had heard before and done that so watch what that touched you read it that touched you that touched him faith never had been done before faith my brother shall rise again he said yea lord he will rise in the last days them jews believe in the general resurrection oh he will rise again he's a good boy he'll raise in the last days i know then he goes down and makes his statement done he said i am the resurrection now i'd like to explain things to detail to work that it'd be unquestionable by people who would be sarcastic so now was that body standing there at the resurrection i like a few things it keeps you awake for one time but comes with that body standing there was at the resurrection so was he saying you know pointing out the resurrection standing here or what did he say he said i am the resurrection now who's the resurrection yeah that's right okay remember do we believe the prophet yes that's right he said jesus could do nothing until the father showed him but that statement he came out of him lips he had told the others that he was dead but he was going to raise him because he believed it but when he got to that place she can't touch him she touched him when he said it never been done before she touched him when she said if you hadn't been here my brother wouldn't have died but nevertheless no matter what he's dead but said whatever you say we know what happened when sister had her out brother brown was explaining those things and she said run around that ain't nothing but the truth amen that's right god said give her what she asked for wasn't that the way it was when the little woman you know said yeah lord you're right that's dogs ain't worth nothing but we eat the crumbs from the master's table he turned around and give her what she asked for now are you following me the resurrection is a person right amen when he said i am the resurrection that was the same i am that spoke to moses from the burning bush when jesus would say i am that i am right so he didn't say that yes he did he was letting them know that within that framework the framework wasn't the resurrection right but within that framework was the god of glory amen it doesn't matter how much dead you've heard the prophet say it if he hadn't said lazarus inspect this specified to one person there would have been a resurrection so he said lazarus that's right because that was the only one who's going to come forth at that time but they said i am the resurrection now paul says in romans 8 and 11 that if the spirit of him that raised up jesus now it's specific it's not saying it the way you read it's specific in what it's saying it's the spirit of him who i am who raised jesus come on oh moses goes down there to egypt and go pharaoh he said by the way who's your god he said well i met him out there burning bush who's gonna take these people out he said i am well it's so close until the words out of his mouth was the dust saith the lord but the flesh was just a human being see that man that flesh man to the quote of the prophet he said he couldn't do anything to the father show me i don't make two people right don't make one going to tell him nothing what to do but he said i am the resurrection amen he said if the spirit of him that raised jesus from the dead what dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also raise or quicken your mortal bodies by the spirit that dwelleth in him the reason it says quickly instead of saying well raise because he then you would just have everything based on the resurrection but it says quicken it uses another word from the term resurrection it says quicken because see the day you receive the new birth that's right they don't resurrect you away it raises you up into heavenly places right a resurrection takes place right and it'll quicken your body amen you know brings your body under subjection so you see why there would be two words used instead of saying raised they would say quicken because it's something taking place that goes on besides just being raised that's what i want you to see about this resurrection amen and then you'll understand why it says that the millennium literally it says it there was written is the first resurrection but you see where where's that part of that resurrection that's right put a brother in a message called fades paragraph one he says you got your resurrection inside of you that's right your resurrection lays inside of you in your spirit that's right amen you're not just your spirit part remember right amen spirit there is soul right that's right amen okay me and our spirit we need it we definitely need a resurrection in our spirit but that's one of those things we have to deal with because remember back there in the early ministry then went out on the air i know i have to say it because i don't made a statement there what's he talking about right in the early ministry brother brown was taught what body soul spirit right not in every case but that's the basis of his teaching then after the 62 of the greatest battle ever fought from then on he would say body spirit soul so back in his early ministry of the 61 here and coming on up he would still be talking about the second realm of mankind as spirit yeah see here he's using spirit lays inside in your spirit well i'll agree to one thing if i never get what's in my soul out into my spirit it's gonna raise amen i mean that's that's that's what we're doing right right you remember the wife has made herself ready all right just getting this parts about the resurrection look at number five they didn't jump so far ahead of me today this is program 110 of the deity of jesus christ 49 12 25 the same power of christ that was hung on the calvary's cross the same god that raised him up on the day of the resurrection is in you now what you that's got the holy ghost didn't see everybody you just got the holy ghost no don't you love him yes does he hear his voice yes you that's not the holy ghost so what is the resurrection right it's the holy ghost amen right because that's the spirit of god brethren you that's i am that's come to live in you amen amen now the i am lived in him the i am raised him all right then i am is the one that come on the death pentecost in the baptism of the holy ghost right that's right and that puts that same god inside of us right amen see then jesus would be the first one that could speak of in a personal extent job would be prophesying of seeing it in the future and he said i know let my redeemer live within the last days now where do you want to put that and where he was raised up when jesus came up or where you want to put it in the last days run around place it both places go ahead do what y'all do but it's still the point job said i'll see him for myself he was looking out there but jesus wasn't looking out there jesus didn't stand there and say i'll pray the father now now it sounds pretty good what you said now martha but let me pray a little while and we'll see what god says you didn't say that my brother around says you'll see sometimes jesus is speaking but says sometimes god is speaking right well you know that's not far off to you and i i mean sometimes every once while he might speak a little bit there ain't no gun lives most of the time it's me elaborating but still you got to get through that if it's too it's the truth it'd be good blabbering but now listen that same i am is now in you by the new birth right if you believe in one true living god amen by the baptism of the holy ghost right to all who have the baptism of the holy ghost are already in the first resurrection not say in the first resurrection the resurrection's already in them because the resurrection was inside of that flesh that was standing down right right right the man we looked at because jesus inside of there was the resurrection right he had no reference that he himself could do anything that's right his reference was to the one that's inside paul had no reference and he could do anything but if the spirit that raised up jesus dwell in you they're gonna raise up your body too amen all right now i'm trying to get a point to you to think about that what is that first resurrection you know it's not a time or a date but it's a person that's right and that person is almighty god god is the only one who can raise the dead that's why jesus would say i can do nothing to my father shows me because in his place he could do nothing he was a human part of flesh but inside of there was almighty god see and once that's changed and goes forth in the glory that you can't separate it we're not going to get up there one of these days and find jesus over here and god over here to fill her fire over here whole bunch of things no no that god may be all in all right as i bring that wednesday night it'll be in you and i am amen yeah all in all the king of kings and lord of lords all right so they asked brother brown a question go ahead number six they asked him a question and the question was about the you know if a person must have the holy ghost to be how the holy ghost to be converted and to go in the rapture what would be the state of children that have died before the years of accountability now i'm not trying i'm not trying to prove any point i'm trying to just read down to to the lies he said i can't tell you that he said there's no scripture in my lesson if i can find anywhere so he just leaving it but i can express my thoughts and it'll strengthen you that believe in grace the person wants to know what resurrection what will happen to a baby that he has to have the holy ghost in order to go in the rapture as i have said that's right that's right that's according to the bible that's the teaching of the scripture not not to go in heaven now see he said not to go in heaven you don't have to have the holy ghost to go in heaven all right because the holy ghost filled people is the first resurrection that's the main point i want you to get to and you'll live and you won't have anything to do in the second resurrection thing that's the main point i want you to get to but we do know that all babies go to heaven so don't try to explain that or spend no time on it all babies going to help going to heaven but if you're going into change and you've got a baby why can't you believe that baby will be changing going to rapture with you who's going to take care of it until the time comes or whatever and i'm just flat carnal on that you mean god's going to take the man the father out leave the baby later before things starve to death i'll take it to heaven no you might ought to remember that when brother brown saw sharon rose she was not a baby anymore that's right she was a young lady and could tell him what was going to take place all right not trying to get over that part because that's a doctrine in itself but to get on to the point of the holy ghostbuild people it's the first resurrection all right now holy ghost field if jesus i'm laying down it's a thought now what if jesus says i am the resurrection right then we believe that those who have the baptism of the holy ghost that the resurrection is inside of you by the new birth making you a part of the resurrection because see that was the reason jesus had to die now he could stand here on the earth and he had the ability now listen to my point for a minute when jesus was here on earth he had the ability to raise the dead he proved it because he done it all right he said the son of man have power to even forgive sins why because it was god in him all right now when when jesus stood there with martha there was a connection between the i am and the martha listen with me and thing that would bring lazarus from the grave so he was waiting on her to say it he just didn't come back holly lazarus come on out she had to say what she had to say to worry that it would trigger to him and touch him and then when it did then he would call the dead all right now if we believe he was almighty god now listen with me for a minute please if we believe that he was almighty god then he had the ability to raise the dead before he raised ladder right so had it not been that he was connecting the human elements of martha back with it on the spoken word he could have just walked up to the ladder of grace and ladder come forward it was god right now did god prove his point of who the resurrection was and it's a person by raising lazarus are you listening yes or was it more definitely proved when he raised up himself he said well it was all the same thing okay all right but this is my thinking it's just odd you know i'm glad everybody don't think like i do my point is that he could have raised the dead he raised a little boy from damn you know i didn't look that up to see where it was before he raised lazarus or not but i wasn't interested my point is that he could raise the dead but when he raised a little boy from nine he never declared i am the resurrection he simply raised the dead because he had that ability he was god but when it comes to martha she got involved he got involved he done told him he was going to go raise him but had she not said that it would have been purely like the rest of the resurrection but this resurrection shows you that i am right right all right now follow me i know it'll take a little thinking right here had he not said to her i am the resurrection then you wouldn't have been able to go to the book of revelation and say that sounds like he says the millennium is the resurrection maybe you don't need that or don't think like that but to me it's very important but by him saying i am the resurrection he was not looking for a future event or a thought or an idea he was talking about right where he was right then and that's what martha began to catch you know what lazarus raised but you know what one day that same i am raised that same body out of the grave that's right sugar was the summing up of him being the first resurrection you understand me he was the first resurrection right he proved it by raising paul said if that same god that same spiritually in your eraser you do to raise you up amen see my whole point is putting it on whether or not you can see who that was standing there right now what he's done he could have raised the dead he proved it he did raise the dead but never a man could make the statement i am the resurrection turned around and proved it be raised the man from the dead but brought it into final proof by raising up his own body you agree all right man see really when you say it then when the when jesus raised from the dead there's your first resurrection right you understand what i mean that's the first resurrection now that nobody had been raised from the dead before then you remember when uh elisha had died and buried him in the tomb and you know and they was carrying a man through there you know and they he was dead and they're trying to get him back home you know and the enemy come up so they just throw him over into the tomb where elisha had been buried and they thought we'll come back and get him well you know what he just jumped alive right see resurrections that come right who was it elijah the little woman had the boy did he die he went laid over him and prayed and prayed you know what little boy come back alive see they had been the dead rays before jesus came but listen to my point the deads that were raised before jesus was talking that were physical people that had simply died and brought right back so it was a resurrection but not a resurrection from going into the grave and coming out but when he got to martha he said i am the resurrection i'm the one that brought the man to life back there with elisha i'm the one that you know elijah laid on the little boy i'm the one that's done that there's never been any dead race i've done it and she said you're right he said but he's got to be brought a little bit closer now i am the resurrection destroy this body now listen is the man still talking is the bible still being written destroy this body and in three days i'll raise it up right right the others were just dead and raised back a few hours or half a day or something maybe a matter of minutes but here's one that said just go ahead and kill me what was it the surety when when he raised lazarus of the first resurrection who he was or was it the surety when the day he raised himself right are you getting it i'm just trying to make things more positive more positive more positive more positive in the talk don't even have a note so i forgot all that but then by doing that there were many people in the new testament that was raised from the dead right the apostles in many cases raised the dead you remember the man falling out the window the boy and dying with paul because he preached along man i'm glad we don't sit in windows around here i'll wake you up but paul went down and prayed for the man that he was raised in the dead there's been many down through there that raised the dead right now none of them publicly stated i am the resurrection right that's right look at me i raised the dead brother i said people talk like that you know there's something wrong with him he said if there's anything done god does it that's right amen the dead has been raised among us but we still ain't got the i am right there you see we live we believe it i believe it too and i've seen it experienced i don't have to worry about that see the man of the eyes are rolled back but when i called his name randall with a loud tone i mean why would i do that the man was letting her wait said he's gone daddy well i just said real he opened his eyes and looked up he said yeah well whether he was dead or unconscious i ain't worried about it i just tell him what happened but you see we're still missing the i am amen because if that man was raised in the dead that's right it wouldn't mean it wasn't my voice there's been a lot of people that been raised but you still how can you come over to the book of revelations and say that and it sounds exactly like that you say in the millennium as a resurrection first resurrection you've got to admit the first resurrection was 2 000 years ago right that was the first resurrection you got to admit that he raised just think about it right went up and come back imparting his life and bringing the resurrection inside of us yeah that's right that's it right in your word amen so the resurrection is inside of you amen now but still can we say i am the resurrection yeah when the lord tells me i admit that openly first number one anybody with any sense and know for sure that has to be him doing it but what i'm saying why would he get over the book of revelations and he'd say would the rest of the dead live not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection all right same thing there's likely never been one because that's the first all right and he's talking about the millennium come on you know we're at least speaking about the money let me put it that way millennium that's not the resurrection all right right come on the millennium is not the first resurrection there's been many resurrections and there was one resurrection that raised up that he could pay the price for you and i right and he was the first resurrector he puts that resurrection inside of you come see when you come into the millennium you are already restored body spirit control right that is the first resurrection right no no no brother dale that would have to be the second one no it specifically states the next verse he didn't have heart in the first resurrection there won't be no second resurrection right what is that saying if we now wait and i'll twist it all we do if you you live twice you die once lived twice from houses nobody got it back years ago but simply means that here i am if i die to myself i don't have to die that's right i don't have to die that's why because somebody died for me right see here we are now looking at the millennium yes but yet when we see the millennial rain a thousand years we can stand there and say look this is the completion of the first resurrection over which the second death can have no park right because we won't die are you listening you never thought about that scripture it gets over there and it says talks about a thousand years and it's also just like a thousand years as a resurrect first resurrection well a thousand years is not the first president the thousand years is the promise of god that somebody's going to live that thousand years which is his word when you and i get to that place we've already went through it like this past wednesday night when we get to that place it will be king of kings and lord of lords right and where the scripture says that all that god may be all in all i'll show you where he said that's the millennial rhyme but then it goes on because there's something left that the future home has a meaning of the all in all all in all you remember wednesday when it comes to the book of revelation 19th chapter and that's riding back with him in the millennium you can't tell no difference in us in him my culture had already been joined see that's the 19th chapter right now we're in the 20th chapter looking back to where we made that ride and we're in the millennium ruling and reigning with him and would it be a problem for us to say do you agree with this so i'll say it first no problem to say the resurrection is inside of us isn't it but what about the end that we can say the resurrection has taken place come on those are going to live in the millennial reign whether it be bribe whether it be israel as a nation whether it be 144 000 then the two witnesses or whether it be the fifth sealed jew they're going to be in the millennium right and remember that's before the white throne so those in the millennium don't have to go to the white room so then the first resurrection comes to completion in the millennial reign now there'll be others given eternal life at the white throne right okay but they won't be part of the first resurrection they can't do it they have to come up the second resurrection right but church here we go into the millennial reign with him riding on white horses and it says we live a thousand years that is the first resurrection or it says this is make sure you stay correct this is the first resurrection looked like it would have been put over there and i believe it was but let's get what i'm saying looks like at least paul would have said this is the first resurrection and you know that would have been true because the new birth inside of him no longer out that lives but christ that lives in me and the life that i now live by the faith of the son of god right amen he knew the resurrection was inside of him as i said this morning he said i want to be a part of the out resurrection brother around explain that if you need it i'll be glad to give you the quote he said paul was not talking about a resurrection he had the resurrection the resurrection was inside of him he said he was talking about resurrection out from mankind out from denominationalism out from the thoughts of mankind to be without resurrection but you see when it gets to the there in revelations 20 it says this is the resurrection this is the first but yet jesus said i am the resurrect and he said to prove it laughter has come out now because lazarus come out of the grave it didn't put him in the first resurrection are you with me because he didn't have a new birth but the new birth was inside of jesus christ that's what lazarus needed raising the dead was fine but you know what he died amen but you see church the first resurrection is the baptism of the holy ghost that comes inside of you and i in the form of the new birth that makes us a participant every how you make those words a partaker of his divine nature to bring him into us the i am is now living in you and i by the new birth or what kind of a god you've got living in you you've got some of yahweh's or some jehovah or something living in you and can't see that the i am is the i am you see when we cross over that veil because by the time the millennium comes to pass you're going to be there in an eternal immortal did we read it this morning eternal immortal body yes glorified by the blood of jesus christ and when we stand there we can look around and say brothers and sisters this is the resurrection this is what i always done down through two thousand years of time that all born again the believers are not standing here with eternal life body spirit and soul standing immortals that's why when they asked brother branham said will it be babies born in the millennium he said he looks like they will be looks like they don't i don't know well that's true for me i don't know either but i i don't believe i was thinking about this today may i not say it as hard as i thought i just don't see how any christian could have any thoughts about a baby being born in the millennium from eternal people uh my thoughts are a whole lot harder than that that's good enough to get the point across i don't think we're going to be having babies from eternal people in the millennium but now remember in the millennium they will be your heather so he said i don't know looks like they will look like you won't lord ever tell them i'll let you know well they never did evident the telecar i never read it but you mean you're going to be brother gary on the eternal immortal body spo soul spirit and then you're going to be thinking about having babies you see where our carnality gets involved so is it with reading this is the first resurrection he would say well the resurrection look that's the first resurrection he said but we're in the resurrection no the bible says this is the first resurrection said jesus never said he was the first resurrection i know he didn't he said he was the resurrection right so when he said he was the resurrection that meant first second third fourth lifestyle beginning or whatever all of it was involved in him right and if it was any dead going to raise is going to be him then he was going to raise up his self he said go ahead and destroy this temple in three days i'll raise it up and he proved it see when we get to the millennial ryan if you understand what i'm trying to say today lived and reigned with christ for a thousand years the rest of the dead lived not again until a thousand years was finished this is the first resurrection like i said this morning now the millennium is not a time it is a thousand years upon earth yes okay but the millennium is a person brother brown said jesus had the millennium in him brother adam was brother aaron was bringing some attention a while ago brother brown said that the seventh seal would usher in the millennium people think boys are dead look here it's already out here no but when it happens it will usher it in what do we think of if a person dies without the baptism in the holy ghost will he be lost questions and answers in 1954 no sir if he's a believer he'll come in the resurrection the second resurrection i guess i got it up there by now if he's got the baptism he'll go in the first resurrection because that's what it is the first resurrection is the baptism of the holy ghost the same person that raised lazarus from the dead comes into you and i by the new earth resurrection inside of us but we've got to get to the place to get away from talking about resurrection over there one of these days one day today we're going to get to a park when are we going to start saying i am the resurrection now that's just looking for you and you know maybe in a way that might be right well there ain't no such thing as in a way that's right because my bible says he's the way. you understand why it says then in revelation 20 looks like referring to the millennium and says this is the first resurrection because by that time all those that will have partakers off this first resurrection without the ones going to the white throne that's an impartation just given to them anybody religious form that had anything to do with it by then already reached their position and we can stand there and say this is the resurrection this is what started 2000 years ago and look where it's completed we're standing here to live a thousand years see this is the first resurrection but we stand there and say it but i stand here today and say the new birth is the first resurrection jesus could say i raised laughter not to show you he said i am the resurrection who's living in you who is it just living in you well we just got the holy ghost brother dale yeah well the holy ghost is the person of jesus christ in spirit form you need that one on a certain point that there's so many uh week weeks after the full moon or something you know or whatever it is that they determine that to be the easter right well the old saying was well hal knows this real well used to plant everything planted on good friday but you better not plant it this time because this is the earliest that the good friday's been in a long time probably you see the resurrection is a person the millennium is a person the person of almighty god come on brother the person of almighty god coming and living in you and i the bible says we're resurrected what sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus but we're still right here on this carnal old natural earth getting older wear it out but we can still say hallelujah the more that i think about eternal life the more i want to get that don't you especially the older we get you younger ones are still in your prime and you're jumping up and down you don't want to see it over with but that's the older one you want to get it over with now if according let's see if i calculated the time that john if he was there with jesus and and maybe 30 years old when jesus was there in about 80 30 or whatever and then 60 years later he was on patmos because it's 1895-96 so john getting old you wouldn't know young chicken like he was to start with so he said come quickly lord right every day i get older i say come quickly lord you say my old days you used to think about boy wouldn't it be great to have a million dollars and just go out and have a good time and just you know i don't mean nothing wrong i mean just live and not have to worry but what does it matter what good's a million dollars that's right you put it in the bank you go down to the bank where's that country overseas is where it not the one where they keep it and won the country just they won't even let the people get their money cyprus they're withholding their money won't let them get the money out you think they can't do that today here all it takes is one stroke of a bend you ain't got nothing in the band so why worry about it we just have a good time i love living yes i love i enjoy being here and being with my natural family and being with my church family and that's all i've got i don't really care about going all over the world anymore even traveling a lot just getting here where i want to go home that's right and you know what brother around said the children of israel had to be crying out for a deliverer remember moses went down there and they didn't want him but then they began to cry out for a deliverer and moses was sent he said when a church age begins to dwindle down he said that people begin to get a lick of fire right in him and begin to cry out for more and he said god answer that with another age to come but we're the last one so there's not another one the next one is the millennium as far as earth right see that is the first resurrection like i've always said to you you know the day we go up in a rapture you can look around at each other and say now i know for sure i'm born again right you see i know for sure i'm born again we step over to the millennium you can say i know for sure amen that the first resurrection was right and he was that and i am that now we can be what 252 in the red boat but do you know whether you have it or not last anybody oh one man said to the other one he called the name of the school somewhere here in the united states it's a big school system he said they told him said you're forbidden to use the word easter now i've certainly still been talking so i'm just telling you what i heard you cannot even use the word easter they were both talking about how bad it was and what was going on so didn't it something that you couldn't use the word easter because you'd be referring to resurrection resurrections i looked at the man and one of them and i said but you can say any cuss words you want to can't you he said you're right you can call him the devil you call god or whatever you want but you can't even say the word easter isn't that something he said but that's not true we can do glad you know if those things are spoken of there somewhere being done you go to a mosque for a funeral or anything you want to you're going to take your shoes off you're not going in but when they come to our services what are you going to tell them they can't learn and they'll have the law after you but yet you call the law because they won't let you go in the mosque without where they won't let you go without your shoes off they're not going to laugh at you and say nothing you know we're in the end time folks whether we want to believe it or not we better be thinking about the resurrection and the millennium and the things you know right we better be concerned because we're in the end of all things that's right it's not back 40 years ago when we were talking about these things right most of you remember that we talked about these things it come a day when it would be we see we're down here today now to see the things the prophet said would take place and then you read the newspaper when you get on today and you'll find it happening right among us the whole country there are cyprus and what it is they just close their money's time you can't go get no money now they're trying to figure out how they can open them back up because they figure once they open them back up and everybody's going to flood the bike to try to get their money but that's carnality of the human mind do you realize if this economy goes down what's in your bank goes down you realize what's in your pocket is the same stuff that's in the bank you know dollar per dollar so if it devalues from 50 down to a one dollar bill in your pocket you got a pocket full of one dollar bills no matter how many 50s you got see it's not what you got in the bank it better be what we got stored up in heaven i want to get out of here thank him these times lord jesus bless us on the way home thank you for these thoughts that we've given today we pray that they were given correctly in whatever you wanted to be saying because this is not a general message about the resurrection and a lot of people preached on and says he is risen because we know if it says he is risen then he has to be living in our hearts and lives but it's a message to see what the resurrection really is it's not a date and a time of the season it's reality of eternal life thank you for these things lord give us a good safe journey on the way home be with everybody bless us sick those that are listening in lord touch each one and just let us all be what you want us to be we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen he shall be me
