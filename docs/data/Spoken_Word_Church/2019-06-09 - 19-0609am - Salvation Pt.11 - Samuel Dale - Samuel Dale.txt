to have everybody together there's some of you that are visitors and we always say when you come one time here you're a visitor and we say to you welcome if you come two times you're just a part of us and also you know some of you have been here before so welcome back that's the best way to say it to the ones that hadn't been welcome to do that we've got a special little event this morning to transpire so let's get that out of the way as we go through into the service so if they'll bring the baby up we will have a baby dedication hey family all family Kondo - okay yeah come on family you've only here we're all family anyway so that that'll be part of it so I have to have a little one to dedicate to the Lord we don't believe in infant baptisms or something like that but we do believe that what the Lord Jesus done he took the little children and blessed them and you know dedicated them to the Lord so that's what we do we dedicate the baby to the Lord but now remember what we also do we dedicate everybody in the building where everybody's dedicated on this dedication not just the baby so you're dedicated to live your life before this child so they can have an opportunity in life so that's the greatest opera thing that I could think of of doing so let's get the little one and see if we can hold her maybe she won't wake up if we do we'll start screaming okay all right okay little Danielle Joy fountain so we dedicate her to the Lord and like I said now we're dedicating the baby to the Lord but remember we're dedicating ourselves to live before the child so that it can have an opportunity to be able to see God in all things so yeah hey you ain't gonna crowd me all right no you're gonna smile on me okay all right little Danielle joy family father we thank you for this opportunity of being able to hold this little one you gave it to us Lord to be something that we could look at and see and see you Lord guiding each and every one of us and we believe you and we thank you we ask you now that you would just Lord accept the part of what we're all trying to do church and everybody family all together we're dedicating this little one to you for the Lord for you to be the great honor of all of its life and then we know too that as we dedicate the little one then we're dedicating ourselves to live before the child so we thank you for it we committed to you now in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen and amen a I'm gonna wake up now now okay amen and amen dedicate them to God that's what our desire is not infant baptisms and or nothing like that but to dedicate dedicate ourselves now so don't forget that you that were present today you dedicated your heart and life to saying I'll live before this one so it can have an opportunity to see Christ and each one of our hearts and lives amen all right you'd like turning your scriptures turn to Ephesians two in Luke three we as I said many visitors with us and many that have been here before and we're glad to help brother brother John and his daughter back with us my my them back with us they walked with us for quite a while and now they come back for a few days to just be with us and honor so we appreciate it thank God for taking care of our sister she had a lot of problems and things and the Lord came down and just took it away so we thank God for that okay sister Monica's class is to practice 12:45 so remember that brother Louise is preaching for brother Burleigh remember him and all of the things that you have I wrote myself a whole bunch of notes so you know we'll try to get rid of some of them but just remember these things okay one o'clock today and then bottom stairs would meet together about the Father's Day outing next week we've got somewhere twenty-something of us that are planning on going right okay if the sisters go in another room and let them talk about what they're gonna do we talk about what we gonna do okay all right everybody understand visions - in Luke 3 father we thank you for this day in your grace and your love Lord thank you for an opportunity to be able to Lord stand before your people the purchase of your blood and to be able to talk about you and the great opportunity that we have to serve you we love you and we think and we ask you to just have your way with each one we know there's many sick among us you promised us that you would touch each one so we believe you and we ask you to just guide and direct each one and just have your way with all of us in Jesus name now remember we've been on this Ephesians - for quite a while so just think about you know what we're doing and just use the verse 8 for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God now remember our point what it's been you're saved by grace through faith we said well I was saved by grace it's through faith it's through a journey through your life you're living your life as a journey to travel through and to see you know and you're saying all right now that's my salvation because that's what we've been on for quite a while okay look into Luke three and three he came into the law of the country about Jordan preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins and it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet saying the force of one crying in the wilderness all right now just as the point before you're seated that's John the Baptist but the main thing is to see what his message was was repentance and remission of sins you may be seated Lord at his blessing through the reading of the word okay now we've been dealing with talking about salvation okay we know that in John 3 Jesus was trying to tell Nicodemus a simple understanding of what it was to be saved he was just trying to to tell him he he he tried to describe to him he said now you must be born to must be born again Nicodemus says oh you mean I got to go back to my mother's womb to be come forth again and he said no no no that's not the story that's not the point but you must be born to water and a spirit water and a spirit bringing him forth into the things that come from a new it all right the new birth the natural birth is a type or an example of the new birth right there is a baby comes into the world first the water breaks then the blood and then the baby coming forth into life so all right in other words what was simple if you'll think about it I tried to explain a little that Jesus was trying to get Nicodemus just to see one thing if he if he couldn't see and understand how that it would take this journey of a Christian life or a point and to bring forth and be you know showing forth to all mankind what we need to do to be saved our salvation okay all right in other words believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved all right we've got that right we've got our points and our thoughts in the scriptures right but the main point is I've been asking you the question do you what do you think about your salvation because if the Lord Jesus was right and we believe that then he was saying that you must be born of water and the spirit in other words natural birth would exactly be the example he's trying to to describe to Nicodemus what is the natural birth water blood and life all right now what would it take then to make the new birth if that's the first birth why would it not be the same things in example form our thoughts of the new birth is it was to talk about a natural birth see then that shows us where we stand then as I said we look at what happens in the natural we see what's happening in the spiritual all right see then what was what have we dealt with in our thoughts and ideas of trying to to bring it to a point of understanding that do you first must be drawn of God other words salvation your first step in the salvation is the fact of whether or not God calls you called in in John 6:44 word and going on down to 65 Jesus was telling them what no man can come to the Father except by me in other words and he said it can't be done unless my father draws it all right so salvation is based upon not whether or not you accept God that's a part of the story but it's upon the basis of whether or not he would accept you all right so repentance or remission of sins is to be priests in the name of Jesus Christ all right now see then in doing that then you see that God must deal with each individual person all right he doesn't deal with a group he deals with each individual the person sitting right next to you can be going through the experience and you sitting there knowing nothing about it but it's not for a group it's an individual he went to the individuals when he was here see Nicodemus was our Peter was our the different ones the ones the Lord Jesus called as he journeyed you know come and follow me you know it's an individual of fire with God it's not what mama done it's not what daddy done all that's well and good we dedicated the baby we dedicated ourselves to live before the child a life to where the child can see Christ that's wonderful all right but just remember mama salvation won't save you daddy salvation won't save you it's got to be your own personal experience so then the new birth what is it then is to be born into the family of God just as the natural birth is to bring you into the natural family upon earth your spiritual birth brings you into the spiritual family okay and as it brings you into that part of the family then you can see your own self in your experience all right now so what has been our point do you remember when God first contacted you or you know begin to deal with you know to tell the star in the book of Acts you know where that three thousand was coming that is they heard the message preached by Peter the last part of Acts 1 - coming through they heard a great message about the Lord Jesus and what he had done and what he come to do and how everything was to be done and and work you know and as they did then they become the Bible says pricked in their heart let's see have you ever been pricked in your heart you said well what does that mean they don't mean stick it says pretty that's you know yeah it's not not that point it's have you ever had anything something to happen to you to her that you knew something was dealing with you maybe it's a way of putting it her however the thought that is you was then you begin to pray you begin to seek God all right so then you can see truly that repentance and remission of sins is where you starting your journey as a Christian and you accepting Jesus Christ as your Savior all right but has he accepted you well I didn't know he had to accept me well then you do now go see that's the point that salvation is deliverance all right he he must accept us we can call all day long upon him and do whatever we do we can baptize we can repent we can cry out we can do all things but if he doesn't accept us well now if he if he's not calls you he doesn't have to worry about accepting you that's why the scriptures is correct see it says what repent every one of them be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you right if you follow in his word then he's promised you alright now I won't the promises of God I don't I don't know where you think about it like that I sure want to and I don't mean this wrong there's a comical point but uh if there's anybody or anything you know I've always said it like this if I ain't gonna Rob anybody you know I'm not gonna do that I take one thing about it I'm gonna Rob you before I rob him because I won't stay on the good side with him all right is that your point don't you want to stay on the good side with the Lord so if I'm gonna rob anybody more Rob you you know and that'll that'll that'll set it up but I'm not gonna do that anyway it's just an illustration appoint of what we're talking about but really he has God ever dealt with you because in the Bible there they would come to a point and they would recognize that God was leading them and then they would move on into the Lord and go on has he ever done that to you do you remember when you first went to the altar say like that when you first had contact with God through some feeling thoughts or ideas or you know some concept or whatever something dealing with you to worth it you're you know and realize God is real see then that away you come to repentance so what's the first thing in God repentance he's calling you he's contacted you he's spoke to you now what's he saying what's the next time you do repent and be baptized in the time of Jesus Christ all right now you got to do the repentance part because see repentance will show whether you're genuine or not those who repent is not what we always thought it was we always thought repent was to say I'm sorry well that's good that's a that's a definition of it but the real meaning of repentance is to turn around you think about it it means literally turn around you were going one way you turn around go the other way you were living for the devil you were walking in his room and doing his thing and then you repent and say God forgive me well you don't keep walking the same way doing the same thing right so you turn around and go the other way so repentance and the remission of sins would be in the name of Jesus Christ all right now see if your repentance is genuine now we're back where was a second ago if your repentance is genuine see now you're contacting God and asking him to accept you right you're asking him to accept you as his child all right what's he saying all right I'm taking your word Enid ours were to me the whole Bible is based upon what would be the words we could use commitments and things like that life is based upon those things you make a commitment you you get married you you do this you do that you build a new home you get a new job you get a different commitment or thoughts and ideas let's see God simply ask you to accept him as your Savior and if that's genuine you know what then he'll accept you I'll remember the point you can accept him all of your life but if you're not genuine well oh do you know I asked him to save me there was you genuine did you turn around or did you keep living the same life you was living but claiming I'm a Christian now because I've repented you know God knows better than that he knows whether or not we're sincere right so don't make no commitments that you don't want to live by that's really the main points you know whatever it is in life don't make it commitments unless you intend to live by that commitment and see then salvation is based upon whether or not your repentance is genuine simple thought simple point to talk about salvation well I cried I've done this out well that's wonderful all that's good but what about what led you there what about this did did you get a contact from God did he come down and speak to you you know one way or the other you become convicted of your life you become you know said my lord I'm sorry you said well well the Bible says if I'll repent then he'll accept me all right that's wonderful you got the Bible but remember a half-hearted confession is not a repentance you know that's why I said repent means to turn around because when you say I'm sorry as cheap words that means I'm sorry a lot of it means I'm sorry then I got caught right it's not sorry to want to get rid of it it's sorry I got caught okay see then that's what we ought to think about God when he contacts us not to just use the words I'm sorry now come on kids come on adults you know what I'm talking about you know Mama and Daddy got on saying you said I'm sorry what did you call it that little doggie face what was it what's the word fart little thing you know that you got the doggy eyes and you looking at mom and dad and you say I'm sorry that's in about two days later you're standing there saying I'm sorry Tim order I'm sorry right see it's not genuine you understand my point God knows whether or not our heart is true and right up in up on him he knows that sure more than we do so repentance and remission of sin is to be preached in the name of Jesus Christ okay you accepting Jesus Christ as your Savior is a wonderful thing but if you're genuine your repentance is not genuine he doesn't have to accept you that's my point that's that's the whole goal of what I'm driving at to us to think about you know do you you you get preachers in them I'm not throwing off on nobody I'm just putting to playing but you you know you get a lot of people a lot of preachers they'd like to get up the pulpit and they like to condemn you right they'd like to try to make you humble hearted by condemning you well that's wonderful that's all right but does it last how long did it last the first time you repented I told you about man he used to come to church with us we would go you know every time we have any kind of revival or anything we go to them you know try to talk to him and he said I'm coming he would he'd come that night and he'd get an altar and he'd probably pray and crying he'd get up and I'm saying now well he never made it till the next night no he never made the next meeting well a year later you go back to the same man contacting you well that's the point of what I'm trying to say that's one of them I'm sorry I'm sorry mama daddy forgive me I'm sorry well you give me a chance I'm gonna do it again you know how I've always held it my kids grandkids great-grandkids they have a halo over their head held up by horns Jacobs life and he'd heard that before held up by horns oh we got the group who got the best kids in the world don't be deceived puppy dog crying you know ya tell will me well we certainly don't do like brother Gary Atkins dad was a doctor and he was a great old guy and the way he'd done things always mama would come in and say oh you know the Gary's been doing wrong you need with him well you know dr. Atkins would take Gary into the bedroom lay him down across the bed and get his belt he'd wind up real hard and he won't need he hit the bed a couple of times hitting the bad girl look at him he said you don't say what's going on he said power he said oh oh okay he hit a bit yeah no do granddaddies though do grande that is but we got one sitting back in the back here that tell you a story that none of the rest of the grandkids can tell you cousin none of them has ever been wilt by me yeah Zach wouldn't get down off the ladder where I could do the work every time I'd get him off one side he'd go up the other side he wouldn't about 2 or 3 years old you know I kept telling him boy I will whip you when he you didn't believe it he kept running up that ladder getting in my way I really did give him old man I just beat him to death you know what I mean pretty money and I went and I said now get yourself in the house and well he'll tell you till today that pawpaw beat the daylights out of him but he remembers it at least he did get off the ladder and get out him away what's he saying I'm sorry it's cheap just remember when you're telling your buddy your husband your wife your daddy your mom Lee whatever invokes when you're telling them you're sorry you know eventually they'll find out whether that's right or not right somewhere down the road they'll find out but just remember the one point when you tell god you're sorry he already knows before you've ever said it whether you mean it or not he's already knows what before you say it what do you mean it or not so there's no need of trying to pull one over on him you say well what do you say you pray you pray Lord I mean I ain't gonna do that again I don't pray that away I mean if you pray that way how many of you pray like that God you help me and I ain't gonna do that again a few days later you done done it again I don't pray that way I said Lord to help me take care of me forgive me for doing it but now Lord you take away the need of that your memory explaining about maybe if you smoked or something like that ask God to take away the need and the desire of the cigarette now you got it right all right see you've got God on your side to understand it you're a human being because that's one thing he understands we are and that's the point of what I'm getting at after where he knows salvation whether it's genuine or not so you're not fooling nobody cuz like I said eventually mom and daddy whatever a brother-sister husband why water eventually they're gonna catch up with each with us and we're gonna be in problems right I see God knows before you ever start he knows why we do those things he knows our thoughts and all before we ever even think them he knows whether our repentance is genuine or not and that's what I'm getting at if our repentance is not genuine why repent well I never heard you anybody reaching okay well I'm just honest that's one thing you'll find out about it I'm honest I don't try to stretch nothing I just tell it like it is the day Danny got his boat hung up in the in the lake he was looking for me to get out and he said one of us has got to get out I said not my vote I'm just honest being honest in a whole lot straighter that's what my wife said you stab a lot of trouble if you and be honest tell everything well I'll try to be that way than to be anything else what about you you see I believe in the salvation that works from an inward experience to were that it works outwardly through us and we are a triune being you know like a body and then we have a spirit within us that the body has five senses he takes fields melting here and in your spirit within you has a five senses of memory reason conscience affections etc that's working in your spirit room and then your soul that has one in one sentence are you know call it is either faith or doubt it's either true or not true it's either right or it's wrong and see then we're not deceiving nobody in doing it and we're certainly not deceiving God in doing it because so you you don't sin with your body you think you do no no no you don't sin with your body I'm gonna fix that in hurry do you think you seen with your body come up here and call me a liar but give me a hammer what do you mean right before you say before you call me some dirty night mama hits you in the head with a hammer I'm gonna knock you out you don't send with your body simple simple terminologies you sin in your spirit room or your memory reason your conscience affections is dwelling within that room there's were you sinned from and we send from that point of us that is the one that motivates us then we can love God actually be loving it with our spirit and not living in with inward being of what is called a soul the David would cry out and said Lord forgive me he said my soul troubles me he would cry out and ask God to forgive him but there was nothing back there because he was living in a time frame it that were there was no new birth because Jesus Christ had not come and died yet he had to come and die and release the life to come back into us and you know to make us to where we could be Christians but David would cry out in his heart and longed for God to help him you didn't go right back and do things but you see we're supposed to be Christians we're supposed to be to the point that when we ask God to forgive us that we're crying out from that inward part of us that part of us that's so longing to see God you ever been that way you were just desired to see God you desire to disable or died like to was it job that basically and perforating it he wanted somebody that he could go you just studied the book of Job he wanted somebody that he could go to a knock on the door doctor yes that's fire phrase in the old Bible or what he wanted he wanted to contact that God that had created him brought him into being and contacted him and time he wanted to contact he wanted to go and knock on his door and him to come out and talk to him that should be our whole Christian desire is to be able to contact our maker and be to the point that we could say lord I can't do this you know if for our problem is we think we can live a Christian life by ourselves but we can't do it we can't live a Christian life by ourselves it takes guard to live a Christian life there's a saying knows it takes Christ to be a Christian right and you know what I'm talking about is true we can do fine for a few days but then all at once we fall back that's you then we go right back to God and say God forgive me help me you know what he'll forgive us but then when he comes to a point to after a while he says straighten up get straight you've been here too many times your little puppy-dog face it's not doing any good cuz I know why you're doing these things David would cry out he said Lord my soul thirst after thee there's a deer panteth after the water Brooks we hunters know what that is you get to shoot the deer it wants to run to water it's thirsty it's got to get to water to live see that's what David was crying out lord or just come and help me now what's the point I'm trying to get to and quit you see the disciples they had walked with the Lord Jesus to his life for three and a half years been trained and taught by him and tutored in Hoorn things great things were happening they were praying for the sick there were many different things were happening the healing of the sick was taking place by the disciples and yet they could never get to a complete release that they wanted the potatoes hired but you know they come a day when it like I like the scripture overhead since I give it to you the other day you know or the pilot in disciple says or Jesus says it as I was sitting out do you now believe you know that's a pretty good point there's D and I believe you know they said well we believe this we believe that we think this he said do you now believe in other words are you really sincere about you believing do you want to be a Christian everybody wants to teach to you and talk to you about going to a great happy hunting ground or a beautiful place or going up to glory or to heaven or whatever we want to do but do you really want to give up everything here to go there what if he asked that what if he asked us to give up what we joy we enjoy here you'll be able to go there would we consider it to be worthy worth it all to give up everything you remember the rich young ruler well he done everything and Jesus didn't argue with it I've done all these things kept him off my youth he didn't argue with him says wrong he knew he had but he hid him weren't hurt he said go sell everything you got and give it to the poor come follow me he knew the point that would cut the man more than anything was his money but you know what the money didn't mean anything cuz I'm like this honest and sincere heart is what God is looking for that's the corner of the scripture our good doings our good lives is fine if it's little from a Christian life within to come out and let others see Christ in our lives but you see there was one walk there with them with the disciples there was a man walk with the disciples he had part of the ministry the Bible says he healed the sick he cast out devils and things like that he walked out with him his name was Judas they nothing wrong with Judas in the writings of the scriptures you have nothing until you come now we know that Jesus being Almighty God knew whether Judas was gonna be right or wrong sure we know that but get to point he was not beaten and hammered about his life he had his own choice to make as I said has God called you will see he called each one hundred apples and said come follow me he called Judas and said come follow me you know what Judas followed him for a long ways Judas followed him as far as repentance he fathered him as far as baptisms he went a long ways walking with the Lord each day fellowshiping with it but what made the difference then well ninety differs in the 120 and Judas could it be but the Lord knew he wasn't sincere and his heart would not that be the best answer he done only could do and walked and done think any honor did he he accepted Jesus Christ as his Savior as we'd call him you know but God he'd say well you know we believe you we've living on what you're doing and your works and was trying to do the one made the difference something came up that became more important to him than his salvation there was money the money's gonna get most people right popularity the ones money is another bad thing it's gonna get most all of us some one way or the other none wrong with having money I believe it's the rich young ruler I'm serious I believe that if the rich young ruler when Jesus said go sell what you got give it to the poor if he said Jesus I'll give him my thumb is that okay I believe he'd he said okay no he didn't need his money right anybody that could send somebody down to the river and throw in the line and draw out money out of a fish he didn't need nobody you understand wasn't getting out God don't need your money in mind it's the pleasure to get to give it to it it's a joy to give it to him it's an honor to give it to him he don't need it but you see Judas come to that point that he made a decision come on I quote the Prophet to you know that he said Judas come to justification Judas come to sanctification in his salvation you can't say Judas was any different than Peter than him I mean Judas didn't wind up cussing about it Peter wound up pretty well got fouled up when he didn't want to be recognized as being with the Lord Jesus right you remember that in the Bible and Judas after seeing what he done he went out and hung yourself cuz he did but the man he had walked with for three and I've years all the time knew his heart knew him well enough to know who yet trusted him he was the treasurer of the church he didn't beat him and a hammer on him what good is that that's what most people think salvation is you know you'd beat somebody some enough to get them on the altar there's two ways of breaking a horse he's gonna break it with love or you can break it with a whip both of them will achieve the same then but which one do we want I'm just talking about salvation Jesus told Nicodemus said you must be born again you say well well he just didn't understand all he had to do is believe and wait a minute you got a man that was coming to Jesus that was putting his life on the line his job on the line and they had a lot of trouble if they found out he was there because they were certainly gonna be ice cream right if they found out he was there the church I'm just asking a simple question is what I've been asking can you go back in your life and find a place that you found God or you started is that still holding you today can you still remember that are you like this soldier was you know that was dying you know chaplain went in and talked to him he said where was your last contact with God can you remember it well he laid there for a little while and looked around and all at once he says now I lay me down to sleep he knew what he left God do we know where we've left him at you know where he's at right where we left it he's waiting on me and you because that's the point we're talking about what we make our commitment we accept him as our Savior we make our commitment then he accepts us and well we walk with Him and we have a wonderful experience in love do you remember were you life's contact was what about it me what constitutes as we're ending up the natural birth water good life what constitutes the spiritual birth believing on the Lord Jesus Christ as our Savior accepting him as our Savior pleading the blood to cleanse us and set us aside and then let him come and fill us but remember a simple little story that always had helped me your beginning of your experience your example of that is like that you're laying out in our chicken yard your glass or a cup mister story you're a glass or a cup laying in a chicken yard someone decides they have a need for that so they reach down and they pick up the glass you don't put nothing in the glass cuz it's dirty you don't pour the water in it you don't wanted to use it right but you've got a reason for picking it up that's what God done with you and I he stooped all the way from glory to come to earth to pick us up remember Saint John 17:17 he he sanctified them he said a mossad he cleansed him that's what he's willing to do any me and you see that's what repentance does repentance works on the basis of cleansing because you take that glice and you taking the house and you scald it you know you wash it you got it right but it still ain't news yet you got a purpose for it when you put it to the purpose that you do and you fill it with water or something to drink or whatever you're doing you know a liquid something you're using it for now you got it to the basis what you're using it for and that's what God is doing with every one of us see we're making their own decisions as to where we stand let's say you say well I've asked God to save me that's good but did you make any promises in that time just remember if you don't keep them you don't have to keep it you don't keep them you know how to keep this all on the basis of what you keep well I believe I believe I'm saved oh great but do we live like the devil and claim to be saved if we live like a devil that's the one that's living within us right well what about your salvation can you put it on the basis of saying I believe the Word of God what it says to do and don't do I try I said you don't say I'll do because you might not do it just say Lord I'll try cause you'll find out one day that trying will turn into a definite commitment then you'll realize that hey I done the best thing in the world what's to say unto Him God help me cuz I need help what about it can we put our salvation into the Word of God in other words take the Word of God and see our experiences how are we gonna wind up like Judas they'll go good for a while and then leave that's our choice Jonah 2 & 9 says salvation is of the Lord okay I accept what he'd done for me but you know the way I live and where I act will determine whether or not he is accept didn't they what about it come on musicians what about it is your salvation holding you now here's the point we end with it's not where are you hold on I ain't know a day whether you hold on it's whether or not he hold them and remember he'll hold on as long as you keeping it work then if you stop keeping his word whose fault is it right whose fault is it it's our fault let's stand together thank own salvation anybody have a name the alders open [Music] yeah my prince of [Music] [Applause] [Music] can you remember remember when you first got back to come [Music] [Applause]
