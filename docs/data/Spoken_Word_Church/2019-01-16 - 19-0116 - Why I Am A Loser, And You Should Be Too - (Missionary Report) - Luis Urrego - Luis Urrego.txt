Sunday you get another refill in there man so we just appreciate you all taking your time to come to the house of the Lord amen now I know it's not to come to hear me you want to hear from the Lord amen praise God so it's good to be back in familiar territory amen lots of different territory as I was in good territory's pulpits always always are nice and the people are beautiful but there's nothing like home amen praise God so let's just go to the Lord in prayer and and then we'll read the we read the word amen our Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for this day once again that you've allowed us to have we appreciate Lord your mercy and your grace unto us father father for if it wasn't for your mercy and grace where we will be Lord father God without you we can do nothing Lord God

Lord Jesus we thank you Father God for watching over my wife as she traveled Lord God and pray that you just continue to be with her Lord and we thank you Father God for just individuals that have come out this evening Lord God to just hear from you lord and father God taking of their time father to hear father what you have to say through your word we love you and we commit this time into your hands I surrender myself to you Lord and just let me say father something to edify the people and you be glorified father for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that we yes Amen amen praise the Lord Jesus for those that you don't don't know my wife is in Canada at this very moment she just took a few days and visited her her family up there so you just she landed about three o'clock this afternoon so she's she says it's cold is it I think the high today was like 24 26 something like that yeah yeah well this come in a few days the high is gonna be like 16 all right so let's go to the word this evening uh if you want to turn to second Corinthians chapter 4 I'm not going to I'm not gonna preach too long and maybe 25 minutes or so 30 minutes and then so we can get into report because Chris Bella is also she's gonna present about five minutes or so say what she experienced so and then we'll get into a report we'll have we have lots of videos and lots of images and we'll just try to get through them as as quick as we can and but I want to hit some highlights and just talk about some things that I think are important that we experienced down there so you all just pray for us amen oh I'll try not to keep you here too long tonight second Corinthians chapter 4 verse 1 this is the word says therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy we faint not but we have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness not handling the Word of God deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God but if if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for Jesus sake I believe every Minister can should say the same thing amen it's not about us and men it's about Christ for God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness had shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken I cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body amen Lord added blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated this afternoon this evening praise the Lord hey man I just want to talk this morning and maybe if I give it a little tylo I want to title it uh I'm a loser and you should be too yeah I hope you got that I got your attention amen praise God I just want to want to talk about how God is pleased to dwell in you and me amen and it wasn't just for the Lord Jesus Christ when he was here on earth and in in and he said in him I'm pleased to dwell when the voice said in him I'm pleased to dwell but if you right now with the Holy Spirit in your life amen God has said the same thing about you amen otherwise he has not he wouldn't have given you the Holy Ghost amen he is pleased to dwell in you and I men and so Paul here is speaking about how we are earthen vessels amen we are earthen vessels that God has chosen that light that he said at the beginning for that he used to create the heavens and the earth amen which that God I explained though one another time that that light is life amen that life God has wanted God wants to place in you and me this is in this hour he meant what uh what a wonderful God that we served that he wants to dwell in you and me I meant to manifest himself to the world through you and I Who am I who are you amen you know what you kind of look like you lived you know I knew what kind of life I lived amen but God can take these type of vessels they meant earthen vessels dirty vessels clean them up fill them with something good they meant to do a great thing in this hour amen and that's you and I praise God young people that's you and I God wants to work through you God wants to use you to save others you may not think so Oh Who am I that you know what can I say you don't have to say anything just live before the people just live before the people and that'll take that'll take care of your day men praise God so so Paul here is speaking about he says here in verse six he says for God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ but we have this treasure in earthen vessels you know and then when you look back at this word that the earthen vessels it's kind of like like clay pots at Walmart yeah there's not as it's not it's not Chinese vases that like for you know those porcelain vases that you see it expensive vases you know God didn't choose something like that he chose the cheap little Walmart clay pots that you see over there in the corner that nobody's touching but somebody that needs those pots amen all right some of you that are gardeners and some of you that not like to deal with plants you need those those pots for your service amen and God chose these put these weak vessels amen these these pots these clay pots amen so that he can fill them up to get something to grow out of that amen praise God you're not who am i as I said you're not you're not anybody to the world to the world you're nothing but to God Amen you're everything amen because he dwells in you amen you might be at work you're working your your the the brother is working may be whistling Amazing Grace singing singing to God yeah and and his wife is at home she's doing cooking maybe taking care of the children doing what she's doing but she's doing it wholeheartedly with all with all that she uh with full passion in it and wants to serve the Lord with it and the world sees nothing amen but God sees everything amen oh you might say oh it's ho-hum it's it's it's everyday amen but you know what in the everyday things is how God wants us to see him it's in their everyday routines where God wants to teach you to see him oh it's good to see him in the exhale you know in there in the in the outstanding things that take place in our lives and an extraordinary explosive things amen but God doesn't always work that way sometimes he comes in as a still small voice nothing moved nothing shook nothing sounded but God was there you may not hurt anything you may not seen lights you may not see nothing bright you may not seen anything Amen or felt anything but God is there how many of know believe that God is there I believe God is there amen because that desire II meant for more of him it's there now if you don't desire more of God then God wasn't there in the first place but when you're filled with his spirit amen and when you have God in your life amen you want more of him amen because the Holy Spirit in you only the only wants more of him he only can feed on the word amen praise the Lord Jesus so what a privilege that that light that that eternal life that God uh that God used that to create the heavens and the earth dwell in you and me yes out in the world knows nothing about it the world knows nothing about it all they see on the outside is sisters with long uncut hair and and long dresses and and brothers who don't wear you know tight jeans and and you know walk around like that and and and and and and you know don't go around with a cigarette in their mouth and you know and earrings and earrings in their nose and stuff like that they don't see that and they might criticize you not knowing that God is dwelling the god that they might say they might say I'm a Christian to the God that they say they're Christian and that they serve dwells in you and me what a privilege praise God amen so you know and and God wanted it to be that way a mint because he wants him to get the glory not for you to get the glory amen because when when you when something happens extraordinary in your life or something took place in your life people might say well I know God couldn't have done that I know I know that person wouldn't have done that I knew him before he came to be a Christian I need her before she looked the way they talked looked at the way they lived and when God does something extraordinary through your life then they got to realize it is it was God not you man praise God so that's the reason why God has decided to put this this uh this light this in earthen vessels such as you and me in first Corinthians chapter 1 verse 17 it says for Christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect for the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of God my goodness why why is it you always wonder why is it that God will decided it to be that way for somebody up here to be slobbering in front of you you know you come like a brutal brother Joel Forney you know he'll come over here and you better my sometimes you better watch out hey I know that for firsthand I was interpreting for him one time and he turned around like this I was right here on his left side and here it comes the sweat right on my lips as I was speaking [Laughter] of course you couldn't you just go like that you know you had to finish what you had to say but you know what that's what God decided that's how he's going to show his power amen through the foolishness of preaching amen now we know that's not just not the only way amen God God could use us in many different ways but this is how God established for his word to go forth amen and that doesn't make me doesn't make brother way brother Dale any of the ministers here anything more than you amen praise God because I've always said you know a minister is one that serves is one that serves I'm here you're actually greater than us because we're serving you think about it that way I'm not anything that's why I can't stand you know we've seen people ministers sitting in the back and things like that you know if a church does it that way that's fine but but I just I don't feel comfortable like that you know I haven't a minister sitting back here and and and you know and that's I want to be with the people you know that's that's cuz I'm one of you amen there's God but I mean that's that's damned if they want to do that but that's just my personal preference amen praise God or the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved that is the power of God for it is written I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent amen where is the wise where is the scribe where is the disputer of this world hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world he certainly has and he's doing it through you and me oh my can you imagine that you know you might think who I'm about to stand in front of President Trump or the President of Spain or the president of though the power of God dwells right here in this little town called Loula Georgia right now Washington DC ya Washington has has believers there right and so it so but but what I'm saying is that who would think that God wants to dwell in this little and little weakened vessels like you and me Amen for after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not god they pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe there it is again for the Jews require a sign and the Greeks seek after wisdom but we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a stumbling-block and unto the Greeks foolishness and then Greeks you know being us Gentiles as well you know it was foolish to us for that for the natural man doesn't understand naturally the things of God you know to look us to us I mean you know how you were when you were not a Christian and somebody talked to you about Christ thought it was foolishness you know Christ but unto them which are called both Jews and Greeks Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God because the foolishness of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God is stronger than men now read that again for the foolishness of God but hold on a second because the foolishness of God is wiser than men so in other words if God had foolishness if there was foolishness in his in him you know that would be more wise than though holding the greatest wisdom here on them upon this earth amen you know I've said before the people in the out in the world they're looking for Superstars and they're looking for superheroes and they manifest it because that's what they show in the movie theaters there's about every three months it's always some sort of superhero movie coming out and they they're just lining them up and anyone that when they got it when they got done they'll just do part two of the they already got spider-man up to life part ten now superheroes superheroes everywhere why because they want a superhero they're looking for superheroes amen but not knowing the superheroes are right here amongst them walk in and working amongst them and they don't even realize it and it's not because of them is because the superhero that dwells in them amen Jesus Christ you're the true super here on this side right amen gödel when you were there working at where were you were at GM General Motors they might have probably seen brother Dale just someone in the common common guy just like one of us not knowing that that was God walking walking amongst them amen and that's what the people are looking for that's what the world wants and that but they'll fulfill it with something else and they'll bring in a spider-man and they'll bring in a Captain America and they'll bring in a Wolverine and not an x-men and all kinds of stuff knowing that you are a superhero on this hour right man because the superhero dwells in you the Superman dwells in you hey man Christ amen because but God had chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty again that's you and me and base things of the world and things which are despised hath God chosen yea and things which are not to bring to nought things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence that is the purpose of all these things so that no flesh will glory in his presence so yes you are a super here on this hour because you have the superhero the superhero dwelling in you but it's for his glory amen and not for your glory praise God but of him but of him are ye in Christ Jesus but if him are you in Christ Jesus who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the Lord amen I can't glory in in what I've done or what I can do a men because anything that I have accomplished it's because been through him a man he's the one that's given me the strength he's the one that's given me the life he's the one that's given me I'm you know every single heartbeat that you have is because of him nothing that you've done right if he said right now is this this is it this is this is a much time I have allotted for you are you ready to go right now at this very moment because we don't know and if he says right now this is as much time as your allotted are you ready to go no give me give me just a little bit more Lord yeah I need to do this I got to do this I got to finish this I got amen we should be willing to say like John Amen Lord - come quickly that's what the Bride of Christ has said it says amen and in Matthew chapter 16 verse 24 and this is the reason why I said you know I'm a loser we're gonna be done here pretty quick says then said Jesus unto his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me listen for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it so how many wants to be a loser that's what I was talking about amen I'm a loser because of that I want to lose myself so that he can take the preeminence Amen so that if I want to save my life I better lose it first you better die to yourself if you want to save yourself amen and I'm so glad that it's not through us that said we can't save ourselves and you can't forgive your own sins but he's already paid it for all for us Amen he's already done a work for us and we we just thank him for that amen so for whosoever will save his life shall lose it what is saving your life amen in other words you live for yourself in other words you it's it's about me and I live for myself and it's about me and you acknowledge God your own acknowledged God at all Amen if it's if that's the way you live your life then you're gonna lose it sure you might enjoy yourself you might have fun in this in this life but in the life to come you're not gonna win they men who is however will lose his life for my sake shall find it that's Jesus's own words praise God amen and you know sometimes we're wondering we wonder Lord how in the world can you use me I'm imperfect look what I did look what I've done and you know Satan always comes around and tells us you know look what you did yesterday look what you did last week and look what you know look what you said look what you thought look look look see see see watch watch and he'll even probably tell you what you're gonna do probably probably to why you did it yesterday you're gonna do it tomorrow again and if you accept the lie of the devil like man that's the reason why we keep falling the same thing over and over and over in the same besetting sin over and over and over and it's like a roller coaster ride you go you're up and down you're up and down you know you're your neon ears day amen I'm serving the Lord oh this this year this is it January 1st comes oh I'm there oh you know and then January 10th comes and you're back down at the bottom of the roller coaster again hey man that's not how God made it that's not the holy spirit that God put in you and me ain't man to go up and down up and down right willingly because we're the ones to do that to ourselves jesus said my burden is light we're the ones who make it heavy we're the ones who who who make the the Christian life difficult when Jesus himself said my burden is light we just you know Jesus lightens it up for us because as as you as you give in to the word and as you yield yourself to him amen he's lightening that load in your life right he'll take it get rid of it but then all of a sudden we we somehow pick it back up again just start carrying it again maybe to like first three months of the year when and then he'll and then Lord I'm sorry I'm sorry forgive me and you laid that okay and then he'll take get rid of it again but you're watching to see where he threw it yeah to go pick it back up again I know but Christian doesn't do we're not we're not roller coaster religion right up and down up and down amen the Christian is firm is stable Amen because Christ is stable they men because Christ is firm a man that he's the same yesterday today and forever and if Christ is in you you should be the same yesterday today and forever amen praise God yes we're gonna make mistakes we're gonna fall amen we're gonna we're gonna do we're gonna displease him sometimes amen but you want to quickly get rid of that you want to quickly repent amen praise God it's a new year Saints and uh I need think I need this just as much as you do amen I we all we all need amen because the Saints if we don't know what's gonna take place this year Amen wait this is uh just things are just coming down to a amen praise God so amen but God wants to use us weak vessels and and and and if you remember in 2nd Corinthians chapter 12 amen when Paul he said he said here and lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh for me for in the flesh the messenger of Satan to buffet me lest I should be exalted above measure sometimes God just needs to he he might put something in there in your life and you wonders Lord why is this not going away well I Love You Lord I'm serving you I'm sorry but God Amen knows how to keep you humble knows how to keep you meek otherwise you know where most of us will be walking like this be walking like this God knows how to God knows exactly what you need to keep you amen dependent on him dependent on for him to get the glory amen and look what Paul says here continues to say he says for this thing I besought the Lord thrice that it might it might depart from me whatever it is you know there's speculations that because of his eyes you know he couldn't see well and he said unto me this is what the Lord said unto Paul my grace is sufficient for you amen my grace is sufficient for thee and you know one timeout one time I was in the in the restroom out of out of all places and that thought just came to mind to my head my grace is sufficient for up for thee and I realized why is it that the Lord told Paul that it's because that's all he needed that's all he needed the when you have the grace of God amen you got love you got everything amen when you got the grace of God that's all he needed to even take care of that issue that he was there he was amen and if we could just depend on his grace and and be thankful for that grace amen praise God and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness imagine that my strength this is this is God speaking to Paul amen mmm my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ may rest upon me oh that's just silly you know praising God when you're sick and you're vomiting and and you have a hundred and three degree fever and you're in the hospital and and there's been an accident and you've been sent to a hospital and and all kinds of bad things taking place in your life but you're still there praising God that's foolishness to the world amen but it's beautiful to the Lord amen especially if it comes from your heart amen sometimes like I said we don't understand why some things happen in our lives and I can't explain it and you maybe we'll never get to explain it here on this life maybe the Lord one day will reveal it to us I don't know but it brought you to the place that you are now amen it brought you to the place where you are now because God wanted you to be here at this hour this is where God wanted you to be so that he gets the glory amen because it's it's it's he's still working on me to make me what I want to be and you know you might say you might say I want to be this way the Lord I want this in my life but God's thinking of a totally different way to bring that to you totally different than what you think it's gonna be and then we wondered why is it that it's happening to me like this Lord but that's the way God is trying to bring you he's trying to answer your prayer through that sometimes we don't understand God's ways but those are his perfect ways amen praise God amen so in finishing Amen some of you may have heard this story before but if you've heard it before hear it again he may one day there was a there one day there was a little boy who had gotten into a car accident and the little boy he lost his left arm and so the little boy you know he lost his left arm and got home got you know got well recuperated but he didn't want to stay all his life you know just sitting around not doing anything just because he lost his left arm you know you know sometimes sometimes we get we get so complex in our life you know just because we got this in my life well I'm just gonna end up just going this way or doing this and you know that's the time to stand up amen and and and do something that Lord you got me in this position and he meant but what is it that you want to want me to do a man there's you still want you have me here with life what is it that you want me to fulfill a man every day that you have that God gives you of life there's something that you must fulfill praise God somebody is looking at your life somebody's depending on you amen praise God so this little boy he he says he tells his parents he says he decides he wants to take judo classes so the little boy those parents said ok that's fine so they found a a a master in town who could teach him judo so he went to the master and he said master well you could teach me judo even though I have this handicapped in my life and he said sure thing son they'll be fine so he enroll he was ready he was excited for the first day of class and when he got to the first day class there was one move that he kept the master kept teaching him a men and and the boy was excited he was excited about that that one move and so he's like okay tomorrow I'm gonna go and he's gonna teach me something else but when he would go to the class he teach him the same move and then they'd go third day and fourth day weeks and weeks and it be the same move that he would he was learning and so the kid was like wondering why in the world so a time came where he had to he was fighting a he was having uh you know fighting opponents and he was winning but he could not explain to himself why is it that he was winning he knew the move and he was winning through that one move but he could not explain why he was winning and then there came a time where he had to fight it in a championship and he went through all the opponents got to the last opponent which was the champion of of Champions and and and and and he was clogging him and he was he was about to lose but then all of a sudden the boy does this one move and he goes down and he wins the whole the whole tournament and so the boy he's wandering and he's still scratching his head and he's excited and he asked the master after leaving the tournament he said master I'm so excited that I've won the tournament and he says sir now I'm glad that you wanted to turn him into he said but I need to find out why it is that the the I'm winning all these matches he said all right I knew that the day would come that you would ask me so I'm gonna tell you he said the reason why you're winning all these matches is because that one move is all you need to look to know and the only way that your opponent is able to defend that one move is for them to grab your left arm and you don't have a left turn [Laughter] amen so what his his weakness became his strength amen so when you are weak you are strong amen I'm going through this in my life but you are strong he said that you are strong amen oh this is happening in my life but you are strong because the word said so Amen I'm sick I did this it but you are strong because the Lord has made a way for you amen so your weakness it doesn't matter what it is Satan will run a rub it all over your face your weakness but that weak through that weakness God to show the world hey that's that's my superhero amen praise God hallelujah how many love the Lord amen praise God okay who wants to be a loser in this out I want to lose I don't care how many weaknesses I have but because I know God amen is can perfect himself through weaknesses amen hallelujah praise God Amen Bella if you want to come she wants to get her testimony be a purple mic yeah you can tell mommy's not around god bless you brothers and sisters it's great to be in the u.s. again and see all your smiling faces I just wanted to share a few experiences I had and in our mission trip and some things that I'm thankful for now there's some things that a lot of us take advantage of so four things that I am very thankful for now our smooth roads warm water flushing toilets and Wi-Fi because when you go to Honduras you're not gonna have Wi-Fi everywhere some experiences I had were feeding a monkey a brother took us on a boat ride to a few islands in Nicaragua and we fed a few monkeys over there and then another experience I had was being attacked by a dog this dog his trainer had taught it to protect its belongings and one thing that the owner had done that morning was he had skinned it he had skinned the sheep that morning which was going to be our lunch that afternoon after the youth service so I was gonna pass pass by there to go see the chickens at the time I didn't know that there was another way so the dog started chasing me and it bit my leg but thankfully I didn't get any cuts I just gave me a bruise things that were hard to adjust to were the roads the road where we went there weren't a lot of paved roads there were paved roads and every single time we got on one we were sick oh my goodness it's a paved road but mostly everywhere we went it was a dirt road and then it was also hard to adjust to where bathrooms it wasn't exactly a toilet it was you had to use a bucket of water to flush and they were heavy buckets when we went to the youth services there were multiple people there that had walked three or more hours to go to the youth services which lasted three days well it just really shows me how hungry people are for God's Word and what they'll do my dad went to preach there and I think he did a very good job and I believe that the people were blessed my favorite part of the trip well my main part my main favorite part of the trip was a mountain that we drove up to called some softball day when we got up there excuse me it was just very calming and quiet you didn't hear people singing karaoke everywhere you went it was just very quiet and then later that afternoon my dad was going to preach and when we got when we were driving it was just the roads were stones squished in together so they weren't exactly even so we were kind of bumping around all over the place in the truck and but when we got to the top where we were supposed to be it was worth it it was very very much worth it there's just two miracles that I wanted to share that happen there they may not seem big and something that people are gonna scream and shout about but it's something that's big to me there was one instance where the brother that we were staying with had lost his keys in the mall and my mom was just praying Lord we need these keys we can't get out of here without these keys and five minutes after my dad said that he had found the keys and then there was another instance where the brother that you helped get tires for new tires for his truck brother Eric there were many instances where his car would break down on the side of the road when we would have to go to a church or back to his house and whenever that would happen the brothers would try to fix it and whenever that would happen me and my mom and a sister and my sister would seeing me and my mom would sing when nothing but a miracle will do and by the time that song ended the car was the car we started again where it was as if it had gotten a new battery and I believe that it's just it just shows me that God's and God's never gonna forget you even if you're just on the side of the road where no one's gonna help you so Zoey just wants to share a little story that she had and then we'll pass it on to my dad all right you wanted to share about monkey all right Thank You Bella Thank You Zoe hey man oh yeah this was this was the first trip that Zoe took outside of North America she's been to Canada but you know going to Canada like going he was being here in the States but uh Bella she's been in the Philippines and she's been to my country so she's seen things that like that she's seen how third-world countries look and the way they live but she hadn't been in a while and so I wanted to take her and so uh it was it was some things were very eye-opening to her and it's definitely for Zoey when you might ask what you wanted why do you want to take your children you know what one of the best things I could probably give them is an experience like that you know they're you know sometimes you know we get so acclimated to this life here and it's us four and no more and and but when you see outside of the shell and you see what other people are going through like walk in three hours to church you you look at things back home a bit differently and I think it's good for young people to see those and to experience that have those experiences you know because you know it'll help them later on I believe in their Christian walk you know help them maybe kind of keep them humble kind of keep the meek and and just just I wanted them to experience that so hopefully the Lord gives give them more opportunities amen that way amen so I guess the brothers that they can start with the with the first amen so this time around what we did is we drove all the way to Miami from from Atlanta and Oh from our home about a 10 hour drive so we flew out from the airport and down to Nicaragua and of course this is Central America Mexico's right here Nicaragua is all the way down here just right above Costa Rica so next and this is where this is this is Nicaragua this is Managua which is the capital and this is Honduras this is pretty much everywhere we traveled the whole it's in miles III I'm not sure exactly in miles of it a lot of pilots that we traveled but we mainly tried to concentrate in on the southern part of Honduras now the brother the brother brother Donald oh that's preached for us here from Honduras he's preached for us twice he's from right there La Ceiba that's where he's from couldn't make it all the way up there but next time Lord willing we might we'd like to take a go go through the northern part of Honduras hey man next so this is uh this is in Miami next and right right in Miami we hadn't even left the country yet and it was already food this was that at a Ruby Tuesday's parking lot they were just there just walking all over the place iguanas everywhere and I think brother Joe mentioned to me that there's there there are a lot of them down there in Florida so that was just uh what was to come I had next so there's a picture of the flight next and we were about to land in Nicaragua next so when we got there the brother that that was what state picked us up from the airport took us to this place to just eat these little I forgot what they call them was basically it's everything in and in a bag and you just kind of suck suck it suck it and there's cheese in it and all kinds of stuff he's like this hopefully this will keep you until we get to our destination which is about two hours away so that's what we were eating next and Zoey was drinking it was they call it cacao but it's really it's like cold chocolate because it's very hot down there in Managua Nicaragua a 95 degree weather it's just very it's just a usual everyday drinking out of a bag and Zoey asked she wondered today not have cups in Nicaragua but that's what they give it to they'll just give you the drink in a bag and would put a straw in it and that's I guess it saves them more money that way next so the next day when we got to Chien and Agra which is the city they're in in in in Nicaragua the next day we ministered at this brothers church and brother our brother Nielson Romero and next [Music] [Music] I was just kind of healing much yesterday a little bit yes next all right so after the service we had we had prayer prayer requests I'm in a prayer line and several of the sisters came up for prayer we took we took the prayer cloths and we we were able to take all the prayer cloths and spread them out through all the different places that we went to so we only gave certain certain amount to each ones and we told them hey look you can still even cut these pieces so they did that so we this is the pastor right here and he's 28 years old young young man but he's he's laboring next so we put this picture in here Zoey cuz uh everywhere Zoey's went and saw a broom she would pick it up and just start sweeping this is the first encounter with with the broom so uh so that's after the service next now if you remember last year when we went the sister that Christine went and gave her a prayer cloths for the her to get pregnant yeah that's that's her right there she's doing March and so like I said like I said you know I wasn't there you know just my wife felt led to give her prayer closet I said we'll be continuing to pray for you and you know just those things like that you know it's nice that you know when the wife goes and she can minister to the sisters where I can't you know so so she was able to do that and we appreciate the Lord for giving him it's a it's a Bela's it gonna be a boy or girl I can't remember I Karen ma'am huh okay next all right so that afternoon ministered at brother Manuel's Church this is his his wife and next [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] next [Applause] [Music] [Music] I'm telling them

you to come to give make her sleepy they can't think about he needs to work on the car tomorrow she needs to cook beans [Applause] [Music] all right the afterwards we had a another prayer of prayer line and we prayed for the with the people and brothers given our prayer cloths right there so hey they all by the way they all send you greetings brother Dale by the way to everybody and they appreciate the prayer cloths and it appreciate your prayers next afterwards they were getting ready to leave to a camp or some special meetings for about an hour away in a truck not the whole church but some of them that's very common to see you know next hmm alright the following day before we took a long journey we went with a they want the brothers wanted to take us to a McDonald's I don't want I don't when I go to those places I don't want American food but of course you know they they they will so but what was interesting is that there are American that you know their breakfast is really their own food is their plates and the McMuffins and those things are down here at the bottom but this is what's prominent so next and this is what you get you know rice with beans and plantains eggs and a tortilla that's a breakfast at McDonald's over there next of course I was ready to dig in oh my god I guess it's not so bad since they have a little bit of their kind of food their next those Oh as we were traveling to Honduras and we crossed over the border we were there at that at the UM at the border where they do all the they do checks and things like that and she picked up another broom and started sweeping next all right so we took several supplies for like Sunday school for brother Eric there in Honduras and also because he uses him he's a teacher as well and for at his school and so we bought these supplies and lots of my crayons and all kinds of tape and things like that so that's some of the things that that we bought for them amen next that you helped pay for amen now this is some of the this is brother Eric the brother that we've helped in his church this is brother Carlos he's a minister brother Giovanni he's one of the brothers there him and him our brothers brother Ali he's a minister as well and I don't know who that fellow is next all right so this is a typical just riding around in the back of a truck everywhere and my goodness is

here we go [Music] very a little sweet berry but it's really good I tell you that anything cold in that weather you know it is good and that was good it was it was really good next and there's always she's drinking it as well and it was oh he was drinking it then it's real good it's hard to get her to eat anything out you know and drink but she we tell her at least try it and when you try it then and she just kept drinking so and they give it to you in these bowl and these these shells no that's actually uh it's a fruit of some sort or something that they have it's it's uh and they just keep the shells and they use them that's how they sell them to the customers yeah they just wash them and use it mm-hmm next and of course they they made me uh little girls made me put on fairy and so alright so this is uh we're heading there the pastors and ministers meeting that was taking place for several days just for you to see how the terrain is this is pretty much almost everywhere where you where you go this is how it is cows everywhere and in the middle just walking dogs and things yeah that's good all right so when we got there this is some of the ministers that were there the pastors at this week-long pastors ministers meetings that were they were gonna have in the morning it was ministers meetings further for three of three or four days they were gonna have about four sessions in the evening times I'm sorry there was two services for the ministers meetings every day and then in the evening times it was a van gistic service under a tent and I was there that was the first day I was supposed to speak that night at that evangelistic meeting under the tent so next [Music] that's like Christine she they got started seeing a special turn it up for their hands [Music] can't tell she's singing in Spanish so I asked she asked me she said what song should I sing and I said well sing this one and she learned it Spanish so I used to like walking around with my with my sagging pants trying to try to get girls I see your dad and I used a rapper [Applause] well brother Eric his wife does too this is where I did an example of take the book from Revelation 10 Bela went and grabbed it [Laughter] and she took advantage because I was at the edge of the pulpit I had already gotten some other at the edge of the platform on man I was added ready told him some of the brothers they of course they didn't take it you know but she she knew the deal all right this is the the following morning at the ministers meeting this is Juana this is pastors and ministers throughout just the southern part of the Honduras I don't know it was at least maybe I don't know 100 200 people maybe 150 I don't know but I'll and you know what I like is that they all have fellowship with one another and that's that's one thing that they do try to respect each other and they may not agree in everything but they at least try to respect each other and they try to fellowship each other with that with each other and everything that's I was wonderful to see next some of these also were not just from Honduras but they're from El Salvador and also from Nicaragua as well next and there's Christine that night she was helping cooking in the little little stove there that they had next car ride a little girl that that was with us her name is Ivana so Zoe's own that she that's the thing with Zoe when she's owned then just don't bother her you know she's owned in just leave her alone next all right so the following day we had to go the sisters were constantly all day long just making meals because the sessions for the brothers ministers the ministry brothers was all day long pretty much and then at night so here's Christine helping them cook next Thursday were cooking shrimp next this is a chicken feet soup and it's it was very good next water they they constantly just use water in little bags so it's it's a filtered water purified water but they just cheapest thing instead of just having bottles you know next day I want to show you this brother this brother he's about your same age brother right here and he was one of the first ones he came into message around 67 68 as well and he was one of the first ones to his mom was the first one to receive one of the first ones to received a message in Honduras so and that he's he's related to him as well so he sure does yeah it's an Eagle Eagle belt buckle yeah he's one of the veterans next and the brother he the brother is related to him he had broken his arm messed up his arm and it was still in the process of healing something similar to what you did brother Aaron and so we were just praying for the brother next this is brother Aldo and he's another one of the veterans in the message here old timer he invited me to speak in his church and the brothers told me brothers told me he's like I can't believe I can't believe he invited you to speak I didn't even invite him we're Hondurans you don't invite Harley nobody and but you know I thank God that you know you found grace in the eyes of these people you know and look I didn't get to visit his church then get to visit his people but Lord willing maybe next time next all right this is one of the area's head into that place where where the meetings were gonna be held that next some more food cooking there next there's a more chicken feet next all right I wanted to talk about this right next to the the church there where they were held into ministers meetings and all there's this little house right there next to it very common to see this is a house and the the lady that lives here has four children her husband was one he was he was one of the ones who went on one on this Caravan that that walking up to try to get to the United States and he came back with a broken arm but you can see why people do the things they do I mean I'm not here about political things you know it but things are hard down there and but so my wife I wasn't there but my wife felt led to give her some money and some of the money that was donated amen to us we were able to give her some money because the only things she has no note no income coming in and she just sells tortillas out in the streets her husband can't work so at the moment but it has four children to to raise so next this is another part of their home next this is her right there with with her and so she's she's she's allowing this is her oldest daughter she's allowing as she lets them come to the church and visit the church she she hasn't come yet but but I believe the Lord is doing a work in her so long but it was thankful that Christine was there and that she was able to you know to minister to her in that way maybe might have done something that heard that maybe she started going to church now I don't know but next all right this is the next night of the meetings there was buses just lined up from different parts of fun of Honduras coming to the tenth meeting next next and this is the the second or third night it was probably about close to a thousand people there that night next and this is afterwards that after this after that long day of doing all that they're in the meetings this is what happens we were supposed to be eating there at a little eatery but Zoey just she was ready to sleep next all right so we visited another brother in the area where my Bello was talking about so inside bought then and he's pretty much up in the mountains but it's very it's very beautiful up there and we had service with them next on the way there

me that his son that lives in Jacksonville Florida he and I got in touch with him but while I was there in Honduras and that's the reason why I stopped by in the Jacksonville and it was to visit his son and then I ended up preaching there too on the way here so next this is what the area where we were we were at the brothers house they may not have a lot but you can't beat stuff like this you

their pastor he's he's bedridden the church has decided not you know not to like vote anybody in until you know they've kept that you know I guess that sovereignty they're still but he's not able to

a Colombians a sister from Colombia there in that church who married a Honduran and she was living in Honduras she was like she came up to me after the service uh it's so glad to see one of my own

this little place right here they only have two machines but one is on one of them is the only one that works right now and it's this one and this two brothers are the ones that are handling that this work and so this would be a if there's if there's anything you know they would we'd like to support this would be something great to support you know I asked him I said how much does it cost for print and for ink and paper and he said about a hundred fifty dollars a month so and they can they can you know have a good supply to print messages and books I mean they print out hardbound books and everything like that and so wonderful work that they're doing next these two little kids right here their dad helped in that ministry but their dad passed away a couple of years ago and they're still helping this is his children still helping in that work so they help duplicate the books and help put them together and everything so you pray for that ministry next this is from there we traveled all the way to Tegucigalpa which is the capital of Honduras about a three-hour drive I was supposed to minister that night so I'm there kind of preparing some notes next this is me doing one of my props again next all right so this right here that the pastor's name there's brother Lucas where we ministered at and the wonderful brother this is brother Eric's church the brother that we helped with his with his uh with the ceiling and the roof and everything this is the way the church is now it's pretty much ready because we were gonna have the church dedication so this is the day of the dedication next on the way there of course brother Eric's truck had problems with the radiator so the brothers are there working on it that's brother Eric's dad next all right this is another the other side of the church and this is a little pastors study right here next this is the front entrance of the church next these are their bathrooms right outside next this is the top at the top of the church and there's the ceiling the roof next this is pretty much what all their bathrooms are if you get a good bathroom this is what you get yeah little Bowl in a bucket that's it next another view of the church they got the little gates now the thing metal on the the windows next next brother Eric's dad made that pulpit himself next next next next again is running out of town this is the study there was no no no no floor there right now but before we left we we were able to give him some money and now they got a floor their cement floor and things like that we'll get some pictures from them next this is the day of the dedication a lot of people came now see a lot of the people that came were people not even believers that lived around the community to the church dedication so they're having an effect on the people when the brother when the brothers were building this church the people thought the the people were were you know they were other churches around the area and stuff we're criticizing them and people were criticizing them and so when the church started getting built it was no work nothing happening for a while but then all of a sudden the church started getting you know when we when we helped put the roof up and all that all that it started getting built faster and so the people around there in the community thought that there were witches because of them why is this work speeding up so much but but some people even from other churches you see the ladies wearing the veils there that are coming in so you pray for that little brother for their brother Eric and that church there next [Music] [Applause] [Music] this is brother Eric that's his wife a little boy and this is brother Lucas which was this was actually his for his pasture I mean before when he the one he grew up with next brother Manuel from from from Nicaragua was the one who ministered at the service next there's with Eric next minister as well and then we we had prayer started dedicating we all the ministers in the church we dedicated the pulpit for the Lord next and then some of the people from the congregation came up from his congregation and we prayed for them as well next there's we were there middle prayer next these two brother Pedro and sister Maria they're very I guess their pillars in the church they've been very very a lot of help to brother Eric so you remember them in prayer next hi this is why we're traveling to another part of Honduras four hours north and up to the mountains another mountain is region and this is a brother you know he's got some weight on him and I you can see I'm in the middle with bags too next we had to stop often because I could I just couldn't stand it next on the way there I was able to speak on a radio station there preach this brother Ali and his dad is the one who has a program of one one-hour program at the radio station he asked me to come and minister at the radio and so I did next alright so you can see this is the first night of the youth camp there at the mountains this is the pastor there at the church and this is the tire wearing boots and because it's so muddy up there next buzz we just got out of the truck from traveling I wasn't ministering that night this is when I had just gotten I was sick with a cold so I couldn't minister and I had asked another brother to minister for me and that's brother island he was the one to minister that night the the heavyset brother that was with us from Nicaragua and as he was ministering next the power goes out so there's no problem people just take their flow flashlights and whatever if they had phones and we just kept having church next the next day I preached and as you can see the mirror right here so you kind of know what I ministered to them about that morning next this is some of the youth that went to the to the to the meet meetings there that week that youth camp this is their first youth camp that they had in that region and so for that for it to be the first one you know it was it was a it was a good amount of people and some of these people travelled about three hours by foot to get to this place the church is in the middle of the woods you can see next [Music] all right we had question-and-answer sessions as well with the young people the first session that we had with them they we asked them questions and one of the questions that we ask them is what is the Holy Ghost and then the other one is what is the new birth what does it does it mean to be born again obviously they're both taught with each other but it's very interesting to get you know to get the responses from some of the young people they're you know they're they're knowledgeable in the word and I was I was pretty impressed but I was able to give each one of us as the ministers gave our you know little two cents I guess on what it was to us next and then the next day also we had they we asked they asked us questions so we had question and answers and they asked us questions and it wasn't questions you know silly questions you know can I get on Facebook or anything like that you know it was like legit questions you know like biblical questions next next this is are some of the beds that the brothers would sleep on they just kind of spread them out me that's where they would sleep on next next I don't know what happened there supposed to be a video this is a little house where we've stayed at and this is the driveway brothers a brothers truck almost got stuck there several times next this is pretty much almost anywhere you go around the area but it's so beautiful next next and better got the whole little lamb the brother has a little farm there next and this is me get ready to come out and minister preach I had my shoes my preaching shoes in this bag I wasn't preaching those you know those were just to come walk around but then I changed right before I come to the pulpit next next next all right this is what us pushing the brother Eric's truck because the battery ran out the juice on this battery had had that batter the juice on that battery had run out like eight months ago and he and he said this is his testimony he said lord I don't have any money do you gonna have to do something and the and his and that battery just came back having the battery just worked for another eight months until we got there and so when we got there we bought him a brand new battery and well that's what we had to do in the meantime while we were up in the mountains where there was not much not much recent no many reach so many resources until we got back to the city where we were able to buy him the battery next bunch we were this sister after one of the services we had with them their sister came up she has four or five children and and started ministering to her just talking to her and and we gave her some money and and she said she said you know what before we even go actually after where she said you know what the Lord had told me that this was gonna happen so that's what she was crying so next and then another day I went into the radio station again and that preacher another 30 minutes I really enjoyed I don't know how many listeners were listening whether I got eaten for his son and Lee though they're brothers that handle the church their next so the Brady ater messed up again as we were traveling back to the city so the brothers they take soap to fill fill fill in the the parts on the radiator and you know just temporal temporary fix next but but eventually we got we got it fixed miraculously it was it was fixed next this is that brother Eric's church I ministered there in this again next this is on the 31st of December this is what we bought the brothers battery and that's the just a new battery in there next and I was wearing an apron I wonder why next and so what because on the 31st that's our anniversary Christine and my anniversary the brothers they had something planned for us we didn't even know so they they had a little food and cake and stuff for us and it was like about 11:30 at night next hmm there's Zoe sweeping again next alright and then that we after leaving Honduras we travel back to Nicaragua and we ministered at another brothers Church there next his study the brothers study outside next to the bathrooms next and then the day before we left we administered at another place it was kind of you had to walk several steps to get to their church next and this is a little place where we ministered at next daddy and the off cie and then we had we pray for a prayer cloths and we pray for handkerchiefs as well that people wanted to be prayed for as well next this is Zoe she's talking to one of the little girls there I don't know if you all remember the church right before I left this is we're almost done that right before I left I met I mentioned the church that I was trying to help raise money for them this is the church that that that it's in Nicaragua brother Manuel is the pastor and and so they they've got they've got it all right almost finished next next this is the inside they've got a good sized congregation so they were building it this is pretty nice inside next next next and so after leaving Honduras Nicaragua on January the 4th January the 6th I believe it was which is a Sunday I stopped in Jacksonville Florida this is brother Carlos the brother in Honduras this is his son and that's met with him and then he's like hey I would like for us to speak at our church so he talked to his pastor and I was I spoke at their church that Sunday next a so throughout the whole trip Saints I ministered probably about 18 different services and and that's not can't well yeah that's counting the times that I spoke on the radio and and so I what I told the brothers I didn't get to baptize anybody we didn't have any baptisms or anything like that we got to see some lives affected by the word but what I told her brother and I said listen all I do is just like Paul said we go and just preach the word the pastor's water the minister's their water but the God is the one who gives the increase amen so we appreciate all of your prayers and we appreciate everything that you all did for us the offerings and everybody is so appreciative of it and without without you all in and then your prayers and I knew we wouldn't be able to make it through and thank you so much and Lord bless you all you and that's it right there [Applause] go down you want to come up I don't okay all right so I listen to our feet sure let's have the musicians come up obviously there's a you know there's invitations to go other places they're around the country but you can only do so much you know so we'll see when the Lord allows us to visit them again but it's there's so much work to do one of the things I wanted to mention is that you know it's easy to go and even though there's you know you go through some rough terrain you experienced some very difficult things but you're preaching to already established churches for the most part but there's brothers there in Lord willing you know I'd like to join up with them and there's brothers there that go to places where the gospel hasn't even reached to them you know and so you pray for these these brothers Lord willing next time I go that's where we're gonna be going and there'll be they travel they travel far like there's like you know it's easy for people from America to come and preach you know at established churches but I want we want the gospel to be preached to people hadn't even heard about Jesus Christ and so lord will and that's what we want we want to do and I'd love to be able to be able to support these brothers that go out you know to these different remote I'm in mountainous areas where there's still Mindy and Indian tribes that live there and so you pray for those people because there's still places that still have not heard about the Lord Jesus Christ that still need the Lord amen so let's just bow our heads and then we'll have brother brother boy sing something for us our Heavenly Father thank you Lord for the opportunity to that you've given us Lord to minister your word and Lord the different things that you allow us to do father God as I as your word mentioned says Lord it's not for our glory but for your glory Lord Jesus and Lord we're all laborers together father God loved us many of us may meme Nate may not be able to go to these places but Lord Jesus they labored father God and gave some of their time and their money and their prayers Lord God so that some of us can be able to go father God to minister to these people and we Lord we just ask father God that you would bless each one here Lord and brother day Oh Lord God is as he father God has a desire for this word to go out Lord Jesus as well father and lord I pray father that you would just help us to take these little nuggets Lord God and ponder these things Lord God and help us to draw closer to you Lord we love you and we commit ourselves into your hands bless the people as they'll be leaving father god protect them on the roads keep them safe father we just commit ourselves into you now in Jesus Christ's name Amen praise the Lord we're gonna sing Jesus coming soon to 88 just one purse and then you're dismissed feeling men's hearts with fear freedom we all hold dear now that Spain [Music] humble your heart to God saves from the chastening rod seek the way pilgrims frog heavens away morning or night or noon many will meet Adam trumpets will sound
