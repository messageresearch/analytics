[11:41] not and many times and
[11:46] trials weakness blurs my vision and my
[11:52] frustration they get so
[11:54] out of head

[12:20] victories and the spirit it rises up in
[12:24] me and it's through the fire my weakness
[12:29] this is a made
[12:34] strong and he never
[12:37] promis that the cross would not get
[12:41] heavy and the hill would not be hard
[12:46] to
[12:50] CL and he never
[12:54] offered our victories without fighting
[12:58] but he said and help would always come
[13:02] in
[13:06] time so just remember when you're
[13:10] standing in the valley of
[13:14] decision and the
[13:17] adversary says
[13:21] G just hold
[13:26] on our Lord will show us
[13:31] and he will take you through the fire
[13:39] again and I know within myself that I
[13:45] would surely
[13:47] perish but if I trust the hand of God
[13:52] he'll Shield the
[13:54] Flames
[13:57] again again
[13:59] [Music]
[14:03] he never
[14:05] promised that the cross would not get
[14:09] heavy and the hill would not be hard
[14:18] to and he never
[14:21] offered hard victories with no fighting
[14:25] but he said help always
[14:29] coming
[14:33] time so just remember when you're
[14:37] standing in the valley of
[14:41] decision and the
[14:44] adversar says
[14:48] G just hold
[14:52] on our Lord will show
[14:56] up and he will take take you through the
[15:01] fire
[15:03] again
[15:06] oh and he never promised that the cross
[15:11] would not get
[15:13] heavy or the hill would not be hard to
[15:21] CL and he never
[15:25] offered our victories without the
[15:28] fighting but he said help would always
[15:32] come
[15:36] in so just remember where you're
[15:40] standing in the valley of
[15:44] decision and the
[15:47] adversary say
[15:51] give just hold
[15:55] on our Lord will show up
[16:00] and he will take you through the far

[29:29] amen Matthew 1
[29:33] 16:13 and when Jesus came into the coast
[29:35] and say to Philippi he asked his
[29:37] disciples saying whom do men say I the
[29:39] son of manam they said some said thou
[29:42] John the Baptist Elias or other Jeremiah
[29:45] or one of the prophets he sath unto them
[29:48] but whom say ye that I am Simon Peter
[29:51] answered and said Thou Art the Christ

[29:55] God Jesus answered and said unto him
[29:57] blessed are thou Simon bar Jonah for
[30:00] Flesh and Blood ha not revealed it unto

[30:24] heaven may the Lord bless his word you
[30:26] be seated amen
[30:29] yeah I wanted to read another another
[30:32] scripture I read it while I'm thinking
[30:34] of it and talk by the way speak maybe a
[30:38] little bit that the bride the the
[30:40] commission of the
[30:42] Bride it's what
[30:44] she's brother said that how we he
[30:47] mentioned these Pentecostal people and
[30:50] not no disregard to anyone but how can
[30:53] they fulfill the the commission this end
[30:55] time when they don't even believe it
[30:58] right they don't even believe in Malachi
[31:00] 4 that's really our
[31:02] commission the whole whole the whole
[31:05] thing revealed in Malachi 4 we know that
[31:09] see because Maliki 4 ends the Old
[31:12] Testament I don't mean it because it's
[31:14] the last chapter last book in the new
[31:16] Old Testament what's revealed in the
[31:19] Malachi 4 but Malachi 4 reveals it it
[31:24] ends also the New Testament amen because
[31:27] what reveal because what what closed out
[31:30] the Old Testament closes out the
[31:33] new right so he didn't ask them he
[31:35] didn't ask him who who the man say I the
[31:37] Son of God am right right he didn't ask
[31:40] him that no he didn't right who I the
[31:42] son of man am amen right he said you're
[31:46] the Christ the son of the Living
[31:48] God he got an answer but he didn't get
[31:50] the answer he asked that's
[31:52] right so then anyway let's read uh m I
[31:58] said Upon This Rock I'll be a church the
[32:00] only way you know God is by Revelation
[32:03] only way you see God the only way God
[32:04] God is getting to you is by Revelation
[32:07] that's the only way that's what brother
[32:09] BR said the world's long for God is
[32:12] revelation amen that's right exactly so
[32:16] uh let's turn to
[32:18] Deuteronomy 2929 one verse I'll read
[32:22] there
[32:24] and I got I got a stack of books here
[32:28] and I told Brother wait I I'm not going
[32:30] to read all of
[32:31] them we get out next week sometime all
[32:35] right slow as I am I'm slowed down a
[32:38] little bit yeah anyway Deuteronomy
[32:42] 29:29 the secret things belong unto the
[32:45] Lord Our God but those things which are
[32:49] revealed belong unto us and our children
[32:52] amen that ye may do all the words of
[32:55] this law amen so let's now let secret
[32:58] things you know Amos 3:7
[33:01] said the children of the Lord God do
[33:03] nothing but first he what he Reveals His
[33:05] secret to his Prophet right amen so they
[33:08] there was there was something to take
[33:11] place on this Earth in the end time time
[33:14] of the end yes sir see and a preacher
[33:19] like me or you you pre Brothers couldn't
[33:22] fulfill it it wouldn't come to you right
[33:24] so God at the time when it's to be
[33:27] fulfilled
[33:28] had a prophetic gift on the earth a word
[33:32] prophet and the word that mster that
[33:35] secret would come to him and he would
[33:37] according to God and come back down and
[33:39] bring it to you and me now it's ours
[33:41] it's revealed if it's
[33:44] revealed there there's a statement says
[33:46] that that we got an open
[33:48] book that's true amen if it's
[33:53] open see but but if it's not open it's
[33:57] not open right amen that's right but
[34:01] actually when that word is revealed to
[34:03] you it's sealed in you
[34:06] amen it's the book he only got one book
[34:08] that's the
[34:09] Bible now Adam Adam didn't carry that
[34:12] around he but the Christ we Adam knew
[34:16] that we know he he's in print right
[34:19] here that's the Christ in print amen so
[34:22] so his Christ's life will match that
[34:25] book because it's the only book so that
[34:27] that's the book you're sealed
[34:29] with if you're not sealed with that book
[34:32] you're not
[34:33] sealed cu the Seal of God it seals you
[34:35] wrote that book am amen they're the same
[34:38] person God ain't one like that he's one
[34:41] in person amen many forms but one person
[34:46] right that's exactly right so now what
[34:49] we're facing today is something
[34:51] different yes this message is totally
[34:54] different from anything else amen yes
[34:57] sir amen
[34:58] now when I say different I don't mean
[34:59] contrary I'm saying it's different it
[35:03] took a prophetic gift a prophet of God
[35:06] he's next thing to God Amen he's not God
[35:09] but he's the next thing to God see so he
[35:13] he gave us the the the the message
[35:15] brought the word to us as Elijah would
[35:18] do right so now so me let me take a word
[35:22] say a word just a moment I'm 85 years
[35:25] old
[35:27] when man I heard a lot I've heard a lot
[35:30] of preaching over the 50 some years
[35:33] close to 60
[35:34] years you
[35:36] know and the reason I stand
[35:38] here
[35:41] today is called brother Dale brother
[35:45] Woodby brother
[35:48] Mo brother Jimmy back there Brother Dean
[35:50] she's not here sister
[35:52] P the foundation they got me started
[35:55] right on the right foundation
[35:58] amen and that's that's why I stand and
[36:01] see he's always Back The Years back
[36:05] brother he always
[36:06] referred when there's a question come up
[36:10] they always ask brother
[36:12] Dale but he God really used the brother
[36:15] but brother Harris he knows he back
[36:18] there those days brother brother Harris
[36:20] still with
[36:22] us brother Dale you know he's here but
[36:24] he's sick and he couldn't be here but
[36:26] see they said word there's a word here
[36:28] now we can't look back there's no
[36:32] looking
[36:33] back everything has happened I ain't
[36:37] been here in 11 12 years it happened for
[36:40] a
[36:41] reason it wasn't bad it was
[36:43] good everything works for the good those
[36:46] that's
[36:47] called so it's not bad and I no hard
[36:50] feelings nowhere I hope it's not on you
[36:52] my I know they not on my part see but I
[36:56] I can stand here with a brother Bob was
[36:58] talking about a pure conscience and say
[37:01] I know I know where I've been the last
[37:03] few years okay so that that's just the
[37:07] grace of God Amen so now I want to I
[37:10] want to get a thought now what's this
[37:11] what what is what is our
[37:16] commission we we we've had seen we've
[37:19] seen Brothers come and go
[37:22] y now if we don't do it who's going to
[37:27] do it
[37:31] they've been they've been almost 59
[37:33] years this December since brother
[37:35] Brandon left we're still
[37:38] here and people still dying
[37:42] physically right so my
[37:46] understanding the when when when
[37:49] Brothers come and they bring the message
[37:51] and I know I've met a lot of preachers
[37:53] over the 59 years been trying to follow
[37:56] this message right
[37:58] something like that close to
[38:00] it and they've come and
[38:03] gone but I believe as brother way was
[38:07] talking about the oration service that
[38:09] we're going to
[38:10] do there a new day
[38:14] da there's a level in God's word is
[38:20] rising if we don't take this message to
[38:22] that next level we're not the bride
[38:27] right that's right and we don't do it as
[38:29] Son of
[38:31] God Son of God won't do
[38:34] it brother said direct statement to say
[38:37] it's not Son of God
[38:39] anymore I mean it is if you coming into
[38:41] the body and you have been you know a
[38:43] Salvation I I don't I Ain saying the
[38:45] door is closed but it's it's getting
[38:47] pretty
[38:49] closed they salvation see but you bring
[38:53] a person into the body but I can pick up
[38:56] a book right here say his future
[38:59] home that's to a redeemed man and woman
[39:03] yeah you can't talk to a sinner on
[39:06] that that's somebody's already been
[39:09] redeemed you see what I'm saying that's
[39:12] right so then we have to we have to take
[39:14] this word brother R said you got to go
[39:17] all the way to the talk
[39:19] right and that's why that's where this
[39:22] message takes you it takes you to
[39:25] top now I hope and pray we we we
[39:29] understand and see that amen yeah let me
[39:31] get started on my notes and I got a lot
[39:33] of things wrote down I'm going to try to
[39:35] go as fast brother brother Wade said
[39:38] just take my time and take Liberty and
[39:40] and I appreciate that
[39:42] and stifling through a few things here
[39:46] but anyway you know just just remember
[39:49] to pray for me that I I'll go through
[39:51] these notes of I and if if you can
[39:53] believe it believe it if you can't all
[39:55] right all right
[39:57] I won't get mad at you but I I believe
[40:00] it what I'm going to say I absolutely
[40:04] believe and no question why I believe it
[40:06] or not I believe it I believe it's the
[40:10] truth because I've heard brother Dale
[40:12] many many time May cour him a few times
[40:13] today many times he say the Revelation
[40:16] the truth is the Revelation that's right
[40:18] absolutely that's what the truth is
[40:20] you'll know the truth you'll know the
[40:21] Revelation makes you free that's right
[40:24] now so now if you I want I going to read
[40:27] in in the in Genesis we'll Hur
[40:33] here used to have a clock hanging up
[40:36] there don't so I guess it's all
[40:40] right go a little long
[40:42] maybe yeah let's turn to Genesis
[40:51] 1 uh verse
[40:54] 26 God said let us make man and image
[40:57] after our likeness and let them have
[40:59] dominion over the fish of the sea over
[41:01] foul they are over the cattle over all
[41:03] the Earth over every creeping thing that
[41:05] created upon the Earth so God created a
[41:08] man in his own image in the image of God
[41:10] created he him male and female created
[41:13] he them now this is when he Elohim when
[41:16] he's self existence he's not Lord God
[41:19] he's
[41:21] God right he's not put anything in in
[41:24] into to form like you know
[41:28] know the Flesh and so on
[41:32] right so when you when we get thinking
[41:34] about the the being back with the mind
[41:36] of God and back in God's mind and what
[41:40] we was before the foundation of the
[41:41] world then when you when you go back
[41:45] before the foundation of the world don't
[41:47] get outside God's mind because you'll
[41:49] get in trouble if you do you can't do
[41:51] that you all you was back there he said
[41:54] Spirit you w even Spirits either a
[41:56] thought or had to be in God's
[41:59] mind so I'll get I'm get a little ahead
[42:02] of myself I'm I'm going to go through as
[42:03] notes in a minute but see Christ The
[42:05] Mystery of God reveal now if I'm an
[42:07] attribute of God see he God existed by
[42:11] himself with his attributes now his
[42:14] attributes are Eternal his thoughts are
[42:16] Eternal if I if I'm a attribute or
[42:19] thought of God and he predestinated for
[42:22] me and place me here in this
[42:25] day only in Christ am by that
[42:29] attribute only way that only way
[42:31] attribute can be expressed is in Christ
[42:35] no other way right so that shows you you
[42:39] bypass the word because Christ is the
[42:42] word right all right go ahead then so
[42:46] God created man he said and he said he
[42:49] blessed them and God said unto them now
[42:51] he said before he separated the
[42:53] masculine from the fish and so on he
[42:56] said multiply replenish the Earth amen
[42:59] now that's the commission amen yeah
[43:02] that's the thought I want you to see in
[43:03] your mind multiply replenish the Earth
[43:08] amen and some do it have dominion over
[43:10] the F fish of SE and the found they are
[43:12] ever living creep thing that creep on
[43:14] the earth so so God did that he had and
[43:18] he goes on you know takes takes the
[43:20] woman the r from the woman man and makes
[43:23] the woman now so this this is when God
[43:28] with Elohim he wasn't God he was God's
[43:32] OB of worship see see so now now he said
[43:35] he created man not a man he created man
[43:38] all right that he made him a a spirit
[43:43] being or theophany man amen that
[43:46] right
[43:48] now showing that he would multiply and
[43:51] replenish the Earth through spiritual
[43:56] multiplication now that's the way we're
[43:57] supposed to
[43:59] come so now if we if we're the very
[44:03] people of God that's exactly how you're
[44:06] coming right now through a spiritual
[44:08] multiplication not through sex
[44:11] desire I brought four children my wife
[44:14] brought them in the world y I had four
[44:18] every one of them was born
[44:19] dead
[44:21] right there was spiritually speaking
[44:24] there's born dead there was concealed in
[44:27] was conceived in
[44:29] iniquity in sin that's what David
[44:32] said because actually now people don't
[44:34] like to hear
[44:35] this but you when you come into the
[44:37] world you come wrong I'm gonna prove it
[44:40] to you in a few minutes I can but God's
[44:42] help amen you come Ser seed in the
[44:48] flesh he said what if it wasn't sex why
[44:51] do you
[44:52] die so sex brought you here God never
[44:55] brought you that way no
[44:58] he gave you a soul he gave you a yes sir
[45:00] say he can't give you a soul he's not a
[45:02] Creator but your flesh is Ser seed it
[45:05] dies it born dead right so it has to be
[45:09] changed right and here we are still
[45:12] 6,000 years it ain't happened yet come
[45:14] on come on Brother come on it ain't
[45:18] happened yet 6,000 years but it's going
[45:22] to the people the people the people's
[45:25] here to make it happen

[45:31] we'll do it as sure as our stand here
[45:33] somebody will somebody's going to do
[45:36] it it's going to be revealed to somebody
[45:38] why can't I say it's going to be
[45:39] revealed to
[45:40] me you the same
[45:42] way now let me stay my notes here and
[45:45] just take my time here he God see God
[45:47] man forming from the dust of the earth
[45:50] he took a rib for the the man made the
[45:52] woman I've heard the word woman means a
[45:55] man with a womb see he had a
[45:58] womb now he he don't don't he said don't
[46:01] don't eat from that tree no right don't

[46:06] away from that you can eat from a tree
[46:08] of life y right you can eat from a tree
[46:11] of life any tree you want to eat from
[46:13] but don't eat from that tree of
[46:15] knowledge if you eat you'll surely die
[46:18] amen amen all right okay now why why you
[46:22] going to die you going to be brought
[46:23] here wrong right amen you brought here
[46:26] death Doom right right now I'm going to
[46:30] read you something here in a minute Lord
[46:32] God said it was very good he looked at
[46:34] him very good had a masterpiece yeah
[46:37] amen now look see that Adam was the god
[46:41] of the
[46:42] Earth right he told him multiply
[46:45] replenish the earth now he had a title
[46:48] deed the abstract title deed had
[46:50] absolutely he had the book according to
[46:53] brother Bram future home what he is that
[46:56] he said it was given to bring forth Sons
[46:59] and Daughters of God because God
[47:01] predestinated a world of sons and
[47:02] daughters so that book was given to them
[47:05] to to bring forth to Children through
[47:08] spiritual multiplication other words
[47:09] through the spoken
[47:11] word that's how we supposed to come
[47:13] because to prove that that's the way
[47:15] we're coming
[47:16] now we're coming by the spoken creative
[47:19] word you come
[47:22] wrong now that's what brother R said he
[47:24] said we have to have a per virgin first
[47:28] amen remember that we have to have a
[47:31] cleaning out first he said before God
[47:33] can do
[47:35] something like Daniel 12 said men to be
[47:39] purified and made white and
[47:42] tried but the wicked won't be they'll
[47:44] let be purified the wicked won't they
[47:46] rejected amen but see now
[47:49] look see he had the title de the book to
[47:53] all
[47:55] creation right
[47:57] I mean over the whole
[47:59] earth not just eternal life to the Earth
[48:03] he had it Adam had
[48:06] that stay with the word and you'll be
[48:10] okay now look and from the from this
[48:13] book he his help me the woman they were
[48:17] to multiply and replenish the Earth with
[48:18] sons and daughters of God that God had
[48:21] predestinated amen now to bring now
[48:24] here's the thought to bring forth that
[48:27] children through the
[48:30] book see that child will have never died
[48:34] righten right
[48:36] amen bring it bring it by the word he'll
[48:39] never die amen cu the word's
[48:44] Eternal right now I want I want to read
[48:48] a statement out here the future home
[48:50] just a second real quickly hold
[48:53] on now think of this see this this the
[48:56] Tree of Life there in the garden there
[48:59] was a tree of life in the Garden of Eden
[49:02] this is page 53 the future
[49:04] home that he might have eaten
[49:07] from if he had if he hadn't to fail
[49:11] yeah that tree of life reminded
[49:16] him all the
[49:18] time that he was staying young his youth
[49:20] was continue on right
[49:23] right now what was that
[49:28] brother BR said Adam was the
[49:30] word what he
[49:32] that how you have word children if he
[49:34] wasen the word right same way spoken
[49:36] words reg your seed brother said a seed
[49:39] of God comes to a born again right you
[49:43] got to have a born again man to bring
[49:44] the true word of God to get the new
[49:46] birth of them that's spiritual
[49:49] multiplication see so bring forth that
[49:52] child he would have never died amen
[49:55] right right right you see what I'm
[49:57] saying am so that tree of life which the
[50:00] word of God was keeping Adam Young cuz
[50:03] he's oncoming something same way with is
[50:05] you and me it's an oncoming something
[50:09] we're coming to it as sure as I stand
[50:11] here some someone's going to come to it
[50:15] exactly right because now look now let's
[50:18] go on a minute
[50:20] so Paul said in Galatians 3 I believe it
[50:23] is he said I'm afraid because he said
[50:26] Satan has Bewitched
[50:28] you you know what that word bewitch
[50:31] means anybody ever up and think of
[50:34] it it means your your your resistance
[50:38] has been broke

[50:43] you just could not resist that's what
[50:45] happened to
[50:46] Eve it broke her resistance down so
[50:50] anointed on anointed ones in the end
[50:52] time exactly right there you go they're
[50:54] so anointed the people can't resist it
[50:58] because why they're not in the word
[51:00] right brother say you be constantly in
[51:02] the word or you'll take a spirit fing is
[51:05] the holy
[51:07] spirit that's what he said amen praise
[51:09] God forever now let me hurry here see
[51:13] you see the woman hbed with a
[51:16] serpent
[51:17] see he Beed
[51:19] her right you will not surely die one
[51:23] word took us
[51:25] out brother said one word will keep you
[51:29] out that's how straight how close it's
[51:31] got to be amen she took the service
[51:35] interpretation of the word the devil y
[51:38] that's what he
[51:40] said all right then the
[51:43] book the book went back to God that
[51:48] right what actually went back to
[51:51] God you
[51:54] did you couldn't come that way
[51:57] you were going you come God permit God
[52:00] will permit you to come through sex
[52:02] desire
[52:03] am cuz you're the
[52:06] book right the only one
[52:09] book right
[52:12] right exactly right amen now I got to
[52:16] think about that I just burn I just set
[52:18] my soul to
[52:19] fire I may get to shout a little bit can
[52:24] tell see so back to original owner see
[52:29] she eat from the wrong tree the serpent
[52:32] be I eat she gave it to Adam and he eat
[52:36] now she didn't hand him an
[52:39] [Music]

[52:46] right that what she brought you here
[52:48] through sex desire amen right right
[52:52] through the serpent Satan use the
[52:53] serpent the Beast right and brother way
[52:57] that spoken se he said every every every
[53:00] person whether you're a pope priest king
[53:03] whatever you are you're born between
[53:06] Satan and
[53:09] Eve let me let me read it this really
[53:13] this really something this is Brother
[53:15] Brandman spoken words you read to see
[53:17] let me read it real quickly see how much
[53:19] time I've got
[53:22] wor what happened to eeve Children what
[53:26] happened to that's right it's supposed
[53:28] to come right
[53:31] right so it turns right around in
[53:33] Genesis 13 after the fall here they are
[53:37] leaving the garden of e their bloody
[53:39] skins sosing down their legs walking out
[53:42] and heart brother God's he just broke
[53:44] God's heart he looked to see his
[53:46] daughter and son walking out there right
[53:48] and he screamed out the seed of the

[1:14:49] when Jesus Christ come on the earth
[1:14:50] 2,000 years ago he was that tree of life

[1:16:05] replenished the Earth right they would
[1:16:07] have multiplied there there have been
[1:16:09] another Adam another Son of God because
[1:16:11] Adam the the New Testament Adam was a
[1:16:13] Son of God Amen they would had sons of
[1:16:16] God that's why it was Christ and Moses
[1:16:18] Christ and Abraham Christ that was one
[1:16:21] seed all the way down through the Bible
[1:16:22] from Genesis to Revelation but listen

[1:16:49] the part of the tree now listen thou
[1:16:53] stood the part of the tree that never
[1:16:58] e now Eve said I got a man from the Lord
[1:17:01] she got Cain he belonged to the devil
[1:17:04] same his
[1:17:07] father but abble needed a sacrifice he
[1:17:11] did he was born he was born
[1:17:14] H he wasn't the right
[1:17:19] son praise God for that part would have
[1:17:22] brought see that that part would have

[1:17:26] of
[1:17:27] God which is Christ the word without
[1:17:30] death in
[1:17:31] him but from the very time Satan has won

[1:17:37] great statement it's going to be hard
[1:17:39] maybe to understand some of you I hope
[1:17:41] you everyone here stand it from the very
[1:17:43] hour the very time that Eve hbid that
[1:17:46] word and mixed it when you hybrate
[1:17:50] anything you mix anything God's not a
[1:17:52] mixer he's a separator he hold that word
[1:17:56] the time you breath it that HB that
[1:17:58] thing you

[1:18:53] chooses the Mind Satan does the very
[1:18:55] minut he pregnated her mind and got her
[1:18:58] mind he had
[1:18:59] her from that very hour this is seven

[1:45:17] God really cleanse the person and takes
[1:45:20] him through the word amen and takes

[2:06:33] Brother Richard and U you know when when
[2:06:37] I first started ministering
[2:06:40] um you were here for the dedication for
[2:06:43] that when I first announced my call to
[2:06:46] minister and he he prayed over me then
[2:06:49] he actually was here to uh when we bu bu
[2:06:51] the building on toward the back and and
[2:06:54] then I announced my call to preach and
[2:06:55] he prayed then and that's been 20
[2:06:59] something years
[2:07:00] ago and the words never got any
[2:07:05] weaker it's always got stronger
[2:07:08] [Music]
[2:07:11] amen the
[2:07:13] what he out here okay let's open the
[2:07:18] door
[2:07:24] [Music]
[2:07:46] this whole place was built on this man
[2:07:48] right here it wasn't built on a man it
[2:07:49] was built on Christ but it has to come
[2:07:52] through a vessel it has to come through
[2:07:55] not an
[2:07:57] angel it has to come through a
[2:08:00] man and brother Dale gave his
[2:08:02] life for you he studied when we
[2:08:08] played he studied some more when we
[2:08:10] played some
[2:08:12] more he gave his
[2:08:14] life so that we can stand here
[2:08:17] today and honor him and also start a new
[2:08:20] era
[2:08:22] that I I appreciate the Lord giving
[2:08:25] us this great
[2:08:27] Foundation amen and we have found a we
[2:08:32] we we found a place that that we can
[2:08:35] come here and we can feel safe as
[2:08:38] Brother Richard said feel at home he
[2:08:40] said he feels like his second home I
[2:08:42] really I know he
[2:08:44] does and it all was when brother Dale
[2:08:47] stood years and years ago when nobody
[2:08:50] else would stand
[2:08:51] he stood for the
[2:08:55] [Applause]
[2:09:00] work and though and though that U that
[2:09:04] we've come to this time and you you're
[2:09:06] you're seeing this the the part that
[2:09:08] that Hannah and Sam Dale produced but
[2:09:11] there's a man inside there yes that's
[2:09:14] just as Eternal as God
[2:09:16] is and just emptied itself out for a
[2:09:19] group of people so that we can stand
[2:09:22] here today and you can hear wonderful
[2:09:24] preaching like this like brother Jimmy
[2:09:26] Harris and different ones brother Steven
[2:09:28] all the ones that we all come up under
[2:09:30] this right and we really we really uh
[2:09:34] you know you could have come up under a
[2:09:35] lot different yeah I know that you know
[2:09:39] that so do I we could have come under a
[2:09:41] lot different but God saw the desire in
[2:09:46] our
[2:09:48] heart to attach ourself
[2:09:52] to somebody that knew how to preach the
[2:09:53] word of God and preach it without any
[2:09:58] hesitation and not having
[2:10:00] to ask for
[2:10:03] permission I believe God gave him the
[2:10:05] permission when he called him he gave
[2:10:06] him permission to speak the word of God
[2:10:08] just like tonight today he gave Brother
[2:10:11] Richard the permission to speak the word
[2:10:13] of God and he just stepped out of the
[2:10:15] way and God just took over and preached
[2:10:16] the
[2:10:17] sermon
[2:10:19] right I asked you the other
[2:10:23] day brother Ram asked us one time he
[2:10:25] said are
[2:10:28] we impressed are we impressed with this
[2:10:31] message are we significantly impressed
[2:10:33] with what we hold in our hand it's
[2:10:38] Eternal it's what God saw it's what God
[2:10:42] wanted and I'm sure he was standing
[2:10:44] there cheerleading for Adam but he knew
[2:10:45] Adam wasn't going to do it cuz remember
[2:10:48] God can't change his mind if he loved
[2:10:50] Adam to begin with he's got to love him
[2:10:52] now right right remember the saying I
[2:10:54] said the other day you know I've give
[2:10:56] God a million reasons to hate me and he
[2:10:58] still loves
[2:10:59] me cuz he can't change his mind if we're
[2:11:02] that attribute as Brother Richard said
[2:11:04] if we're that attribute God can't change
[2:11:06] his mind and say no I made a mistake I
[2:11:08] picked the wrong one no he never will do
[2:11:10] that never has made a mistake and never
[2:11:13] will but we we have brother Dale here
[2:11:16] with us today we're going to eat
[2:11:17] downstairs we're going to do have the
[2:11:18] ordination service now if all the um a
[2:11:22] ones would come up that would uh that's
[2:11:24] part of the spiritual leadership of the
[2:11:26] church which would be me and brother Bob
[2:11:28] brother Aaron Brother Louise brother
[2:11:31] Terrence brother Ryan Brother Gary CR
[2:11:33] brother Robert Dy and sister Lisa you
[2:11:35] need to go get her too she's a secretary
[2:11:37] Traer if y'all will come up front please
[2:11:41] and U I know we have board of directors
[2:11:43] and all that but that's not an ordained
[2:11:46] according to to what brother random U
[2:11:49] gave us is the spiritual leadership of
[2:11:51] the church this is the spiritual
[2:11:52] leadership of the
[2:11:54] church and I believe that God has has
[2:11:57] give us a place and a
[2:11:59] position and and look at all this he's
[2:12:02] give around us he's give us uh and I
[2:12:05] I apologize for for The Gap that we've
[2:12:09] had between when Brother Richard was
[2:12:11] here and brother Jimmy Harris was here
[2:12:13] you see what you've been
[2:12:14] missing they know how to preach we
[2:12:17] listen to all these other people but
[2:12:18] they know how to preach they preach with
[2:12:22] anointing and they preach the
[2:12:24] truth and brother Jimmy it'd be an honor
[2:12:27] if you'd come up here with us please
[2:12:28] brother and and he is a um has a a
[2:12:33] church there in uh Riverdale I guess or
[2:12:36] somewhere close to there and if you'll
[2:12:38] come up here with us brother Jimmy he
[2:12:40] started his ministry and he took a a
[2:12:44] group of people and he's leading them on
[2:12:46] to the coming of the Lord and we sure do
[2:12:49] we haven't had them in this building in
[2:12:50] a long time but we sure do
[2:12:53] appreciate them in their stand for the
[2:12:55] word of God and I I'm I'm going to ask
[2:12:58] them to pray over each one of
[2:13:02] us that has a position in this church
[2:13:05] it's going to be hard I told y'all long
[2:13:08] you know before when we had our meeting
[2:13:10] the uh you know the days of playing is
[2:13:11] over the days of of coasting is over as
[2:13:14] Brother Richard was saying we' got to
[2:13:16] push we got to we got to go that's the
[2:13:19] third pull we're there's a pull coming
[2:13:21] that's here now that's pulling us but
[2:13:23] you know what it's pulling us to where
[2:13:25] we know where it's pulling us to right
[2:13:28] we're a group of people that know what's
[2:13:30] going on I just believe that we're we're
[2:13:33] not guessing we're not it's not happen
[2:13:36] chance it's not brother Richard's going
[2:13:37] to just preach on this and no it was
[2:13:39] anointed of
[2:13:41] God to preach what he preached today and
[2:13:44] and all of us we we sit and we we study
[2:13:47] and and we we toil just bring you 30 or
[2:13:52] 40 minutes hour hour and a half
[2:13:54] service so let's bind together all right
[2:13:58] God's ordained it to be this way this is
[2:14:00] the way it's going to be until God
[2:14:02] changes it and when God changes it
[2:14:05] that's all right with me but until he
[2:14:08] does brother Jimmy come up here with us
[2:14:10] if you don't mind brother and you pray
[2:14:12] over all of us come
[2:14:16] on God bless you brother he just lost
[2:14:19] his daughter a couple days ago and we
[2:14:20] helped do the funeral I appreciate them
[2:14:23] calling off their service enough to come
[2:14:25] up here and be a part of this I wanted
[2:14:27] to be a part of this service cuz he's
[2:14:28] been a part of my life too all these men
[2:14:31] mold you and make you into what you are
[2:14:34] if you'll let them kids let them don't
[2:14:38] try to think you can do this all by
[2:14:40] yourself I can't do this all by myself

[2:14:44] talk to him and get counsel from
[2:14:48] him all the other brothers

[2:16:52] we just got a good group of people it's
[2:16:54] like brother um um bcll was preaching
[2:16:58] that service we had I think it was 06
[2:17:00] down in in Gainesville and and he he he
[2:17:04] was talking about the people that he had
[2:17:06] around him and and he he said you know
[2:17:09] he said you know you got a pretty good
[2:17:10] stable of
[2:17:12] horses amen you got a good Stable horses
[2:17:16] you you're proud of them when you got a

[2:17:22] or but I'm I appreciate all of you
[2:17:25] you're the voice this is the final voice
[2:17:27] of the final age they're going to hear
[2:17:29] you're not going to hear it from anybody
[2:17:31] else right all right it's the Bride of
[2:17:34] Jesus Christ preaching the word of God
[2:17:37] so I I would appreciate if you brothers
[2:17:39] would U everybody kind of gather a
[2:17:40] little bit closer together everyone pray
[2:17:44] and and brother if you'd lead and you'd
[2:17:47] pray too and pray over these and we're
[2:17:49] going to do it together not individually
[2:17:51] so we can save some time and then I want
[2:17:54] all of you to B together cuz Satan's
[2:17:56] going to try to rip us
[2:17:57] apart he's going to try to rip you apart
[2:18:00] he's going to try to do it but he can't
[2:18:02] do it it's like Brother Richard said if
[2:18:03] it's if it's predestinated and ordained
[2:18:05] it's going to work and the Bible's
[2:18:07] already predestinated from the
[2:18:08] foundation of the world so he can't
[2:18:09] change all right and I love you and I
[2:18:12] appreciate you I want to be that servant
[2:18:15] I'll take up an offering anytime I don't
[2:18:16] care it don't bother me a bit but that's
[2:18:19] what we are we're servants to the people
[2:18:21] and if anytime you need anything I've
[2:18:24] got these two I can depend on now and
[2:18:26] and feel free to talk to them anytime I
[2:18:28] want to and and some of the other
[2:18:30] brothers but if you need
[2:18:33] anything if you're having problems and
[2:18:35] issues let's talk about it let's be in
[2:18:39] love with each other let's don't let's
[2:18:40] don't let that root of bitterness Drive
[2:18:42] in a wedge in and separate us apart
[2:18:46] let's don't let's don't do that so so
[2:18:49] let's bind together that everything does
[2:18:51] if it ever does come let's get it out of
[2:18:53] there cuz it has a root in it and the
[2:18:55] only way to kill a plant is take get the
