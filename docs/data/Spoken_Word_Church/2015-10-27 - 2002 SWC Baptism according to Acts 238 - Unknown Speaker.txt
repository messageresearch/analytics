TRANSCRIPT
========================================
southern baptism not here in the cluster were you still in the water you know doing the baptizing in the crease tonight we're glad to have them will we enjoy we have a we had a wonderful time together is it just my mac to the baptismal service that they get to come and participate with us appreciate so we'll ask him if he'll just ask the blessings of the Lord will be a phoner the baptism service today our fathers we are about in your presence here and Lord we realize the significance of this moment in your presence father many times I've related to the candidates what it's not what it really is it's like a funeral service where we bury them yet the arrays and newness of life it's also a wedding where they take on the name of the bridegroom father may the reality of after repentance may the reality of this moment being those that getting baptized may they realize what's taking place in their lives and if the enemy would ever come and try to which he will try to tell them nothing happened let them be able to point back to this scene here at the creek where they may they be able to point back and say here's where we buried the old nature and I rose and newness of life to walk with Jesus Christ father bless this time and may Lord as the gentle dove that came down on the river that day when when the Christ was baptized may that same gentle dub of the Holy Spirit come again this afternoon we commit this baptism of service the words that are going to be spoken descriptions can be read whatever is gonna be done to the hands of Jesus Christ for your leadership and Jesus they know most of you heard enough flame to you know the baptismal and what it is that we don't believe in water baptism into regeneration is not doing that but it's showing what you believe once you're taking out you're taking on the name of Jesus but when you were baptized maybe before and your Father Son and Holy Ghost people in times past and our brother said today they wouldn't responsible for what they heard and done Luther baptized father son Holy Ghost no no but when truth comes you walking through you know and the way I like to baptize gonna remember this I find it a little bit in the prophets message the way he baptized and I do it a little bit different than maybe some of the other brothers do but I make sure one thing that you understand their father son Holy Ghost is in the Bible we're not trying to do away with Richard we're trying to fulfill that spin it's in the Bible to be baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son Holy Ghost but that's 119 yeah and that name is Lord Jesus Christ a father son oh we go Lord Jesus Christ so you'll hear me say now to fulfill the Great Commission to baptize in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost I now baptize you my brother my sister in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so there's no way you can do to man and we we know that and you don't make fun of nobody else's believe your thoughts of what they believe because you and I believe those things at one time we thank god for true he said use your nose Dietrich it's not true truth of key will be truth will set you free so let's just read the scriptures from Romans 6 i'd like to read istanbul we go into the baptism Romans 61 what should we save him shall we continue in sin that grace may abound god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein no you not tell me you busted for meth oh Jesus Christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father even so we also should walk in newness of life where we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that his former should not sure for he that is dead is straight from cincy that's what your baptism is you're going down your brother McRae and into a grave you know you're dying to yourself can you come forward to walking in unison Christ so that's this what Paul's explain if we were we be dead with props we believe that we shall also live with me knowing that Christ being raised from the dead diced no more death has no more dominion over friend that he died he died unto sin once but in that he liveth he liveth under God likewise reckon you're also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord that's that's a wonderful thing to think about what you're going to do you know not just a quick little run in history it was customary like back in the in the Bible for them to baptize people that were their followers and that was kind of roll over in and it became the truth the description now that wouldn't just haphazard God just he knew that was going to be but see the truth is you are being baptized to follow a follower to be a follower of Christ the asked what's your baptism means is you're going down you're dying to yourself and come up newness of life how that regard right then as we baptize men north as we are all witnesses of your majesty I she be a witness for st you thank you we commit it now to you Nordic Jesus man will feel the great commission that our Lord Baker said we baptize father in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost make sure we get this knife then let's just pray father my brother has found this place he desires to be baptized take in sale me to fill our
