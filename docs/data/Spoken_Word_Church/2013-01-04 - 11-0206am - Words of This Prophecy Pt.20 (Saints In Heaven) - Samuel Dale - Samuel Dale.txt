that in speaking about you then lord it's a great opportunity to be able to try to express what we as mortal beings would see one to another about an eternal God but for that Eternal God to come on

loss of his mother and just bless and be a comfort to each one Lord let your light shine in each one of our hearts and lives we love you and we thank you forgive our sins cleanse Us in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 and then Revelations 5 is the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show and to his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who bear record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand now let's go over to Revelations 5 and uh we'll begin reading about verse 5 through1 one the Elder saith unto me weep not behold the lon of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and low in the midst of the throne and in the in the and of the four beast and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that set upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beast and four and 20 Elders fell down down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vows full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sang a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the Earth you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now I'm going to try to finish up this series on the words of this prophecy this afternoon you notice I said try cuz I was fully intending to uh just speak a little bit and have questions and answers on this and and I see a couple of of loopholes you know maybe in uh where the things that I should bring out in other words so I'm going to continue on through today and the Lord willing we try to end it up this afternoon if we have time we will have comments questions and answers upon what I've been talking on and it's like I told them last night at the Bible study you know write down your questions and thoughts when they come to you because if you're like me you know and all of you are not 70 but some of you are and by the time time that you think about something if you don't write it down then it's gone and we have then what we sing the song Precious Memories you know cuz we can't remember nothing about it you know so we we need to write them down so write them down and turn them in and we'll try to cover them you know if we need to take services on it but uh I've got a little something next Sunday that I want to speak on and that's one reason I wanted to transfer the communion over uh not because it'll just be lenty this afternoon but I have a reason for for wanting to uh do it I wish you would before next Sunday I was fully intending to start with on the Sunday afternoon to pray play the tape of brother brandom preaching on the communion you know there in ' 65 right but I just decided Well you play it you listen to it you know he explains the the uh things the conditions Etc uh about communion and who it's far and things like that so I would ask you to either read the book or listen to the tape on communion uh by next Sunday and that way we won't play the tape we will uh we would do it but I was intended to just play it the other night we were listening to it and I thought that would be good to play right before communion time would be just to play that one in' 65 you know and it would be good I you know may still do it if I could get my thoughts together to bring everything the way I want to now I hope that after this is message 20 on this and after reading this scripture here in Revelations 1 I hope that we're getting something uh out of it to understand you know the point that I've been trying to bring all now I I want to bring this to you over and over and over and I may mention it two or three times this morning two or three times this afternoon because it is a point that I believe is very vital I don't believe that we're looking at the Book of Revelations in the way that we should I know it is the future uh of the church and the things but it's also what has been you know what is and and all like that but what I want you to think on is see I believe our mind is not locked on one I believe it's locked on one point and we need to unlock it maybe that's not the correct way to say it but that's the best way I know to say it that you know sometimes we get our mind set in a Channel all right unless something goes in there and clicks that you know it it will you know you're only going to get out of a computer what they call it trash in out is that the words that's that's used and and you know you only get what's in there well you know sometimes you got to you got to change things around so I want you to think about now cuz I believe that's where people are missing it and we'll get to it this afternoon more of why they're believing brother brandom was the one that come to John on patmas now I I don't believe that because that would be pre-existence and see then you say well it was uh John was transferred over to this day well still be careful because what would be that other word one of them's pre and other's post is that the way it a pro you know in other words coming over you got a problem there and like w says about it then if you want to transfer over here and say that well you know this is the way we see that he was transferred over well then how come brother random was was you know incorrect on his understanding of the seals and things right uh looked like he would have known about it if it was a you know a transfer as we think John was transferred over to where brother random was let's just leave it alone amen cuz see I think what our problem is we're looking at a point and not understanding it and what I think we need to look at it John was chosen to write the Book of Revelation right that's it now all right dyus were the messenger came to John right and I believe that was the prophet I've preached that to you we'll get more on this afternoon and show you more about it but I believe that was the prophet and he said it might have been Elijah but see you know just just we'll just get it in try to go on a little further but my point is let's deal with the writing John's dealing with the writing of the Book of Revelation he's not dealing with the end time of the the revealing right it had to take a prophet to come Amen in in the end time that's right to reveal it amen you know now you remember what we brought out I'll say this back off now that we were bringing out that that the uh you know the word only comes to the prophet well now I'll give you something to think about this evening and you see why it'll take me a long time to express it U Matthew Mark Luke and John would Prophets Peter wouldn't List It Paul's listed with the prophets brother R list him with now he lists the churches Messengers with the prophets now you know things like that but I'm talking about Major Prophets right for the word to come to right and you know that John on patmas wouldn't have made your profit so you better consider it amen you know it might pay for for us to listen and go back and listen over and over and over until we get it that may stir up your cure curiosity to get you to think about this evening okay now let's get down on what we're talking about see we've covered it over and over that this is the Revelation that God gave to Jesus Christ see to bring it to John and by doing that he sent it by an Angel right all right a messenger to come to John on patmas you all then we can tie it together and say the word come to the prophet but now what I want you to consider today is that I want you to look at something that I've tried for many many years to get us to see that the Bible shows you not as what you are now listen to what I'm saying right it doesn't show you you as a sinner right amen you say yes it does now I know I know the scriptures and Paul said we all had our conversation I know the scriptures but you listen to the point the Bible shows you how perfect you are that's right but we don't ever get on to that we just get on to how bad we are y well now if the sacrifice I'm asking that for your point now if the sacrifice in the Old Testament made the worshipper clean enough to be able to stand in the presence of God right and the high priest had to you know behind the veil and the sacrifice made that person perfect enough to stand there when we know that person that was standing there was not a born again believer that's right there was no new birth back there Jesus Christ hadn't died yet all right but now and he would go in with his thoughts and he'd come out and he'd still have his thoughts he he couldn't be changed that way but if that could show how perfect a person is what about the blood of Jesus Christ when are we going to believe what God has said about us right well brother Dale I I just do too okay stop doing the things wrong I'm not talking about that I'm not talking about a garbage Camp I'm not talking about well I can't help it so brother Dale said I'm perfect so I'll just go on live like the devil and I'll be perfect now you got a bad problem you've got a mental problem let alone a spiritual condition right to to think like that you know see so that would be entirely wrong it's not that it's doing it's it's the point of where that when we make mistakes we repent but we don't keep doing will I Repent of that today Lord I'll repent of it tomorrow so I'll repent next week so let me just do it two or three today where I want won't have to worry about next week that's Catholic right Penance paid for before you do those things and that won't work all right but see follow the point of what I'm talking about that the Bible shows us perfect that's right I've kept trying to tell you you can take Paul Peter James John you take all of the writing of the new testment and you'll find a prophecy you know you can read a prophecy of Paul talking about how perfect we are by the atonement amen but the Book of Revelation shows you as being already there right and how perfect you are cuz that's why I've always said it's your book that's it's your book bless you brother sweetie and good to see you amen bless you but we've been trying to cover now that it's the Revelation that God give to Jesus that's not trinitarianism right right that's the same thing as we showed about the writing of the Bible the the Revelation coming in the correct order see but Jesus did not know his part in the Kingdom that's right he said I only do what the father shows me all right see he limited his own self by dwelling in FL with us that's right to the point of not being able to know all things true right all right and in doing that then see why can't we believe it see that way you stay away from trinitarianism and you stay away from Oneness amen cuz if you're going to believe in Oneness you're going to have to believe that Jesus knowed everything and there was no problem because you're going to believe he's God right well I believe he was God but I believe the way he came he made his own limited condition to where that he wouldn't destroy us where he could come and live with us all right and see in that then he didn't know his part in the Kingdom but when he come see he said I go to God I come from God I go to God but then he come right back yeah well when he came back to John on patmas he did know right and would be able to I said a moment ago then to bring the Revelation to John that John could write it down right so we're dealing with the writing of the Book of Revelations right when brother brandom comes into view you're dealing with the revelation of the Book of Revelations all right we must have that in the end time had to have a prophet to come and tell us those things even though it was written down we had to have a prophet to come and tell us thank God for that just get it in the right order get the writing of the Book of Revelations first that's right right amen all right then we'll get the revealing of the Book of Revelation you that make us come to that point all right but see Jesus Christ after his death bual and Resurrection the prophet said and at the time he came here to John on patmas he knew all the things that would take place all right the kingdom that he would come to be talking about is the kingdom of the father right he would know his place in the Kingdom right he didn't know his place in the Kingdom now watch he knew he was come to die I preach that to you he knew he was coming to the world to die to release that life that was within him that the father's Kingdom could be made manifest but this is a natural thing maybe he thought he would just up and go away and the father's Kingdom would come into view but now he said I'll be with you even in you so he knew that something was going to happen here and it was going to be the kingdom inside of me and you that he was coming making a way see all right the then as we see it then the baptism of the Holy Ghost come on the day of Pentecost bringing into manifestation not the throne that Jesus spoke of that the two the wanted to know if one son could sit on one side and one the other she knew he was talking about some form of a kingdom but that wasn't the one that he was coming to make to bring into VI view or to make ready for it if he hadn't to come the way he came you know and died then the Father Strong could never been made manifest all right see because it wouldn't it wouldn't have never come into view but he come to make that manifest all right see which would be on the Earth and it would be then the father's Throne the prophet said down through seven Church ages that's why he died son of man Rose Son of God would be Son of God Through the Ages and then right in the end time just before the end of it you know he would come back as son of man that's right and then he can go as son of David all right now we've been over that over that over that so I hope it you know like some of said last night in the Bible study said you preach this and then you preach it over and you preach it over that's right I just approached it another way and just keep trying to bring it to where we can can get an understanding all right now we've covered the Book of Revelations in this much that in the Book of Revelations you do not see the Lord Jesus Christ by himself right that's why I've labeled it and called it the bride's book right cuz you don't see Jesus Christ by himself you always see him in the form of the church or in the church or you see him to Israel through two prophets even the lamb as we've read here in the Bible the lamb has seven horns and seven eyes and that's in Bride form right see and it that lamb come from the church ages that's right all right see then that we're dealing with as I said now remember we're dealing with the writing of the Book of Revelations amen don't get your thoughts into the revealing of it that's right see stay with me as I'm talking about the writing of the book and to getting it to the place that we can see all right so he's either shown with his bride in his bride are in those forms because we've been through it like Revelations 1:13 you know one standing in the midst of the seven golden Candlestick like unto the son of man G about the PS see feminis with a golden girdle you know Etc all right so we've been through those things trying to to bring it to a place to where we can see what God is saying about us the Book of Revelations is showing more of the future point of the church then it is to say the present state of the church all right the present state of this church is bad I'm talking about Lula Georgia I ain't worried about the world I ain't talking about denominationalism I'm talking about Lula Georgia okay anybody else wants to claim this as their Church home out there on internet listening we're in bad shape but we're in the best shape could ever be right cuz nothing's out a caterer that's what your Prophet said about it everything's right on time time it's supposed to be this way but we as individuals must deal with the basis of trying to get ourselves out of the way amen amen that God can come on the scene to to deal with you and I all right now so what are we talking about now keep in mind what I say you now you say you know and like I said when you're in the first grade you always you say 1 + 1 = 2 you don't go to 2 + 2 = 4 till 2 weeks later you're still on 1 + 1 = 2 all right so I keep repeating remember we're dealing with the writing of the Book of Revelation right not dealing with the revealing of the Book of Revelations right all right now but to promise to the Overcomer of each age shows a specific situation you know something related to uh then all right you know through the time but then it would show something as to coming into view as uh the future and the dealings of the things cuz when you get over to like Revelation 3:21 and all like that where it says he that overcomes will sit with me in my Throne as I've overcome sit with my father in his throne all right now we know where his Throne is at his throne is the millennial rign the son of David right that's the throne that he's speaking of right all right now that way then it shows like I said the Overcomer it shows where you're at so then what the prophet when he said the seals and things will show you what was what is and shall come all right so now it's a dealing with that all right son of David in the millennial Reign all right but to prepare for that Throne that would be the millennial Reign he had to come forth as the Son of God in you know he was son of man upon the Earth then he died son of man cuz you don't crucify the Son of God you died son of man where the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Son of God could come into the church and live in the hearts of the Saints and that would be the father strong right all right now then you would be see for just a moment the secret is that he is to come back in Bride in the end time not just brother Brandon right amen he was a son of man but the bride must be the son of man all right we've been through that see all right she must be the word made flesh around the world not just Lula Georgia that's right not just one church or one thing it's got to be around the world and it's got to be everybody catching their point so he returns in Bride form on earth now listen he returns as bride form on Earth in the bride right and that will match exactly Revelations 1:13 right right right now you remember the matching pieces about I don't know how many years ago and brother Ray is going to take a a little job that he thinks is going to be easy he said he had plenty of time at home and he's going to take a job of trying to get some of those older tapes of serieses and things that I preached on bringing them over from cassettes over to mp3s good luck cuz it's you know it takes a lot of time sitting there watching them gauges and making sure trying to filate us the same time okay but now see I preached a series matching pieces in other words what's on Earth got to match what's in heaven right when we that's the Rapture to me right see Martin Luther come forth with a just shall live by faith right now he matched what's in heaven about him right in the Bible the writing and when he did he had to go by the grave cuz he was nowhere to go all right see he couldn't walk off the earth in the Rapture cuz that was not the part he had to match right see this is the age when the matching part has to come forth to be able to see what went down remember the other day we bringing that out the grain of wheat what it went down has to come back am not just in the church ages but come back cuz it was the son of man that went down right amen all right so it's got to come back to son of man see on Earth and that matches what's in heaven because she's shown in Revelations 1:13 one standing in the midst of the gold seven golden Candlestick look says like unto the son of man see it didn't say the son of man like that because it's given us the key to understand that if it's like the son of man then it would be the son of man in a multiple form am not the son of man in one form see but it would be in a multiple form in the bride of Christ around the world see that would come to that place all right now and when she does see then that would be Jesus Christ in Bride form just like he was upon Earth amen y just like he was has got to be heing you and I amen right then that matches exactly what the Bible said we would be see we got to become what the Bible says we are right amen that's my whole point if you miss it of anything see the Bible tells us what we are we must become what we are right that's why I don't agree with the people the way they preach about you know we always was eternal I know with the quotes of the Prophet we'll get to that but I don't agree with the way they're Pro well I always was eternal don't matter what I done what this I was just Eternal well that make you an eternal sinner right amen this won't work when you match here What God Says About You everything's all right am but it won't be all right till we match it all right now us being then the son of man the word made flesh and the bride of Christ upon the Earth to match that that he spoke of the then is we would be the life form of God upon the Earth in this dispensation right now he'll go to the Jews in another dispensation that's right the Jews then will be be the LI form of God in that way but we're the LI form of God here on Earth because we're the alive word see in other words we're watch spoke of in the book right see what the book says we must become amen right now what if the book hadn't been written you wouldn't know what to be that's right right all right now I'm just you know I know the way I speak I say things funny but it makes you think see to take the writings without the Book of Revelations you know you you could see things but you could not see it in its Clarity right that's right CU Paul didn't say I looked up and saw the bride up in heaven see he he didn't say that he told us how to get there amen he told us how to Live While We're Here and prepare to go there that's right all right but see John on patmas is showing us already there right right amen right that's the writing of the book what's that when that book was written ad 9596 God saw the bride already there but we must become what he saw that's right that's right all right we must become everybody listening what he saw Yes but don't worry about it we will right you said well brother Dale I just got so many problem well that's the problem you're looking at the problems you ain't looking at what God Said right right why do you need an atonement right y well brother there if I'm Eternal all I don't need an atonement that's where the problem is that's what I told you the sister used to play the piano for she said who was I going to pray to said cuz me and brother Mo was preaching this in 1971 and two and she said the way it's being preached she said who do I pray to I'm him I said you went too far well it proved it because she didn't stay with the truth she back and went out in the world it proved she only had a mental conception cuz see she wasn't looking at what we were talking about CU we must match here what God sees there that's when we'll go right right we'll go when when we might hear what God sees us right and has already said about us but you know somebody will do it why cuz God said it but we got an opportunity to be part of it right that's our part to be part of that if we don't prepare ourselves for that cuz the Bible says his wife hath made herself ready right it didn't say he made his wife ready right we know he does right but she's got to make herself ready she's got to put on the wedding garment right which is a revealed word that's right well I'll just take it easy and God's going to that's the predestination we talk about denin I believe in predestination as much as I can believe it I'll get to it the Lord willing next weekend I believe in it just as much as can be I believe everybody in the world's predestinated one way or the other that's right some are predestinated under salvation some are predestinated under rep probation right I believe that but it's all by for knowledge of God right not that he chose it's because it is for knowledge all right now let I get on that get on another message so you see my mind it goes over there where I'm studying okay at least my thoughts am all right but now we see that we took a message and we preached about Revelations 4:1 as being the Rapture all right John taken up in 4:1 is a type of the bride of Christ right all right so now as far as God is concerned and he's not concerned about you and I you say well now you say that and then you say we ought to be straight well that's that's our business that's our part of it he's not concerned about me and you and what we're doing he's already told us what we're going to do right now we may get a lot of weapons because we don't do what he wants us to do right okay that's our choice now now what what I'm getting at Revelations 4:1 shows the bride already in glory all right now CHS her already there goes on to chapter five and shows her and where the lamb came from Amen to take the book right y was from the church ages amen he said Bo I tell you what you that's where people don't get it right they look down at the church ages and they say boy all of that's a mess you know I told you before and I don't I'm not throwing off on nobody that's your belief but there's people that believe that like Luther and them didn't have nothing Wesley and them didn't have nothing Pentecost didn't have nothing but we got it all and that's the way they preach it when you do like that you don't have nothing to stand on either and you got a lamb with one horn you got a unicorn that's right right right and I according to my knowledge now I know they talk about it that it made didn't make it over on arcs reason it missed you know but I don't think that's right because I don't ever remember a unicorn like that now the Bible speaks of a unicorn but it's not talking about a one horned goat I know the Bible and what it says it talks about a unicorn it's not a one horn goat cuz according to my understanding never was a one-horn goat you know well see then you make yourself a unicorn because if you believe that we're the only ones that have it it's got to have seven horns and seven eyes and brother brand as I said a moment ago and I've discussed this with ministers in this message he said that those Church age Messengers were prophets well no ain't no way in the world even Paul wouldn't won see there Paul wouldn't even a prophet well he said he magnified his own office well you argue with him about it brother Ram said they were prophets not major no right there's prophets in the fivefold ministry but they're not Major Prophets right right the prophets in the fivefold ministry must get theirs from where that the prophet of that time brings the word that's right so that shows they're not major all right now listen I'm trying to get down to something CU see we're looking at the Book of Revelations I said the writing of the book all right now when John wrote the book then he got over to um you know in the writing he spoke of the church and how perfect she is right he spoke of the ages and how they would come down and that each age would be beautifully wonderfully decked out and would be able to bring forth that lamb but then he gets over and finds that the book is sealed well now I don't have much sense but plain language uh you don't seal a book until it's complete right you know that true you know it's complete all right now so God would look down and see it complete right right now there's things yet still to come that's in the Bible but when it was written to John on patmas it would be written as a complete book right and that book The Prophet then would say a seal with Seven Seals and those seals would show you what has been what is and shall come all right but it's a complete book all right now then if the if the lamb Through the Ages would come forth you know from the church then God is looking at her as a complete book right and seeing it finished all right and seeing everything already done right so he writes it to John you know John's to write that John is the Scribe right all brother R said it's the only book in the Bible whereas the Lord Jesus Christ come in personally to ascribe now so then he come to write the book so when God looks down Through the Ages he don't see our faults and favs yes in the ages he'll rebuke right but when he ends that age what does he say he always comes to the end of the age and gives a point of showing not only his Revelation you know of who he is but showing because each age has got a revelation of the deity of Jesus Christ you know the Sevenfold Glory of his person in the church age book read it that's right amen but it also shows the the bride that's right cuz it shows the Overcomer it didn't wait till the last age to speak of Overcomer each Church age he receives a message about the Overcomer all right now according to my understanding the prophet declares that each age receives what's previous right right all right so we would get the overcoming of every age amen what a wonderful opportunity we can see all of what the others will be able to receive amen we can see it while we're here right amen because we receive The Complete Book all right now but the book has to be completed all right now see then the book is the one that was the book that was to be sealed is who curious about all of the things but you know the Bible is really written about people amen right y when it talks about a beast rising up that's not a King Kong walking across the Earth you know sorry that's not exactly what it is you know that's in the people that's right and even though it's bad things it's still about people Armageddon is a great terrible Battle of the termination of forces but you know what it's about people right the Bible is written about people it's not written about houses and buildings and ships and boats and and things those are just things that are in there to tell you what age you're in or whatever the Bible is written about people that's right that's why Paul said you are what yep Epistles written right that's right see we we turn it around and I know I do most of the time anyway but it's really I think the correct way saying his epist epistle is written right in our heart it's not just something written it's written about what people on Earth that's what I've tried to get you to see you said well we can look back and we can see this age we can look back and we can see this age we can look back and we can see this age in the Bible y well the Book of Revelation show was our age cuz this is the age when God is going to reveal the entire Book of Revelation amen we know what's going to take place to the Armageddon the the you know Gog and Magog the Millennium the white Throne judgment the the future home why because it's been made known to us all right but now follow what I'm trying to get to so then the The book must be completed and then it's sealed right all right now we look at it and we read seal number one seal number two seal number three now that was what was written about the book right but the actual seal is in the time of of Israel in the tribulation exactly amen you said yeah I know it because the seals reveal what was what is and what will be the seals reveal the Antichrist that starts down in the ages right right but the Antichrist is not the sealed amen Jesus Christ is the sealed amen that's right and where he's at is in the people to combat those things that are coming forth I'm talking about writing of the book all right now John was told to write back there and he was told to write what he saw right so sure now John looked down to see the age we're in wonderful and he wrote about it he marveled at that white righteous church that was there because it was even so great till it till John got caught up in it amen right see looking at those things but get the point point now what I'm trying to bring see because the bride is part of the book cuz the book is really about her even though you would be talking as I said about the Armageddon tribulation go and Magog uh White thr judgment and the future home you find that each one of those is showing you that what God is doing for his bride upon Earth right now cuz he's revealing those things he's revealing those things that will happen to Israel because what is it U mzd when he came to Abraham said can I withhold anything from Abraham seeing he's the air of Salvation so he couldn't withhold it he can't keep anything away from his bride right he wants his bride to see it and to see what part we are now you're I gave you some quotes where that we could just see some see the book is sealed that's the breach page 79 1963 through1 17e the book is sealed and you are sealed with a book until the day of redemption the book is sealed and you're sealed all right now think about that the book is sealed so we talk about pulling the seals off and looking at the book all right now are we not part of the mystery that's right amen are we not to be revealed is that not according to the next two quotes I gave you from Christ of mystery God revealed that the bride is part of the mystery it's impossible for her to not go it's part of God's mystery how God revealed himself here and raised it up by the word s of reveals the church and raises it up by the same word it's part of his threefold mystery what was it all God was he put into Christ all Christ in the church she's part of the Myster all right now that's page 74 going down to 75 of Christ the mystery watch what he says see the seals when he was in his mediatorial work back there redeeming but someday he comes to get this book that he's redeemed right and all that's in this book would be him okay I pause there all that's in this book would be him now what's him right for that's the Believers amen okay now that's what he's saying for that's the believer right what is that the words in the book and the word is him and all that's in him he come forth for this book of redemption see it's all about him it's a revelation of Jesus Christ right all right but it shows where he's at then the Book of Revelation shows that the bride will come to the place as I said a minute ago to realize who she is because we are the book now think about the sealing of the book it was sealed back di right y right y that was sealed back there all right so you listen to what I'm talking about John saw it the book was sealed right that's right now come on you you understand I'm talking about the writing of the book all right so back there John saw the book and it was sealed amen he saw about the church and the things he saw the things and wrote them down but do you really believe he understood you didn't understand the seals and the things cuz he wrote a symbol right that's it he wrote a symbol that's right he didn't understand now he understood a whole lot more than probably me and you yeah okay but see because the book had not been completed on Earth yet right now the book that's going to be sealed is the Bride of Jesus Christ right amen the word and then it will go to Israel to be released to them amen right what book the book of the Bride right the book of the children of God Amen coming all the way through from Genesis all the way through see the children of God all right so then when Israel gets the book they don't have to have this to read you know what I'm saying they're not going to be reading the prophet's message as we think you know this message will go to Israel no they just go over there and tell them the truth of what happened right read in the seal book about I don't know it's somewhere 470 something but it's on the seventh seal and notice what the prophet would be covering how that they will tell them said you missed it that's right you missed this point but said the bride received it we are the book that'll go to Israel amen that's right amen but it's got to be completed before it can go to Israel because that's the one it can take now the opening of the seals back there see the the seals they were sealed up Y and would be waiting for the end time to be open and we are the book then that's sealed when it's complete see then it's sealed all right see you and I when this is completed and we go out of here in a Rapture the book will be sealed up until that time of us right all right and then it'll be open to Israel yes right right to tell them about us right and how they turn down the sunship there in rejecting Jesus Christ but yet the bride received it and he went into Glory see see there's a lot of difference in the writing of the book and the revealing of the book there's 2,000 years between the time John wrote it and that brother randam could come and preach the seals you know right at it 1925 or something years whatever you want to be technical but see the prophet said the book is sealed and you are sealed with the book right right did you see what he's talking about yes and the Holy Ghost is the only one that can reveal cuz there's only one seal and that's the Holy Ghost all right there's seven Parts in the bases is like the seven spirits of God but that's not seven spirits that's one God in seven manifestation the seals are Seven Seals revealing the revelation of Jesus Christ not the Antichrist that's what you ask people say what's seal number one Antichrist well that's not so see number one is the revelation of one true and living God right amen that's right to where you can see the Antichrist riding off amen cuz that's how brother Rand you he said see that guy see that other fell cuz if another fell you got two people you got two people you got to have the Antichrist cuz he ain't two people about God there persons there's only one true and living God but see she's part of the mystery all right who him that's in her right making her the Believers in the book and it's not completed yet to be able to go to Israel right now listen to what I'm saying the book is not complete yet to go to Israel why we must complete it upon earth right and once we walk off the earth in a Rapture is what I was getting at the other day see then the book can go to Israel right but the book is sealed to them right now cuz they can't see it that's right right it's over their eyes they're blinded all right now watch then see then we are the word that's written it'll be written about us now you say well be written about us and you know you can't write no more to it all right then it must be in there to tell about us I'm glad you thought of that you know they say well you can't no you can't add to the book so it must be in the book to tell about us so read the book to find out about yourself right don't go it now get me right I'm saying I know I'm hard and strong don't go ask Grandma how perfect you are she never sees your problems you're perfect in her eyes that's right go ask God what he thinks about you you'll find out God is a whole lot greater than Grandma cuz Grandma did see what you done God when he you forgi ask forgiveness he forgives you God don't even see what you done so I'd rather have God than grandma right that's right because a better understanding boy I'm getting slow get the old age you get really slow that's 2 Corinthians 3: 2 where we're Epistles written and we're written in our and written in our hearts he said all right now but see the lamb takes the book after it's written and looses the seals right and makes it known to the bride that's right that's got to be made known to the bride all right look at the evening messenger number four your notes after the book is written evening messenger 1963 1116 after the book is written then it's sealed back there with Seven Seals now no one knows what they are after the book is written it's sealed everybody's want to talk about unsealing you better first see it sealed up that's right amen and why is it sealed up because the only seal I know is the Holy Ghost amen phans 4:30 right and the Holy Ghost has the book sealed why because he's not revealed it to us that's right he's revealing it to us now and the revealing of the book is revealing Who We Are and what God thinks about us now that's been the whole message I sure didn't go mean to go this way but it's all right now it shows us where we are yep well I just read the book all right that's good but ask God to reveal it right you ever do that you ever ask him to reveal his word amen yes L ever ask him to reveal how perfect you are well I just he said I'm perfect so I'm perfect all right now that goes to one end of the scale other end of the scale is well there none of us perfect somewhere in between there there has to be a middle of the road you say well I just read that's what I mean you just read the book and just say what the book says now according to science about 50 years well a little longer than that now we got too old about 100 years ago science proved if you rolled a ball somewhere there about across the Earth at 25 M hour you it just pick up and leave the Earth you know right because that's that's what they thought right see they want to make sure to keep it like 25 because nobody could run that fast it wasn't nothing back there to do that but I wonder what why they they they never did think about it what if you fell off a great big own tall building you're going to reach more than 25 mph before you hit the bottom but they never thought of that that's all right I'm just carnal but see they proved it right and they wrote it in a book you want to read that book no we don't want to read that book all right so the Catholics come along and they wrote a book you got to do penance you got to crawl so much you got to pay so much you got to do so much we don't believe that book right the Baptist come along and wrote a book you got to be baptized in our church our ways the Methodist wrote a book you got to do this you got to do we don't believe them books right cuz that's not the word that's just like brother Ram said the book of mccabes and all of these others the the Lost books of Eden the uh uh Aggie's Purgatory um the extra books of Daniel or whatever it is are he said that just won't compare with the rest of the Bible right he said so we don't believe that right but see I want to believe what the Bible says amen and the Bible doesn't say go live like the devil because God is AD do old Granddaddy and don't see your sin it's not written that way I'm sorry and if you think that's the way it is you got a problem well I can just do what I want to you know I can cut my hair a little bit paint my face a little bit I can work you know wrong clothes I can do this or whatever the men this that and the other you know the Bible's not written that way right amen the Bible's written about an overcomer that's right that's right and each age had that but see we not going to fool you're not fooling nobody you're fooling your own self amen now what I want you to look at for a minute is I don't know exactly how to approach this part but I want to get it to you we can see then that the Rapture takes place all right to the bride cuz the Bible says it the Bible shows how great she is because it shows her as the even the lamb coming from her right to take the book now as I said about it the writing of the book is one thing the revealing of the book is another so the writing of the book showed the sealing of the seals and the lamb back there but it would have to show coming down in the end time after the seals would be to be revealed then it's going to have to be to the church the bride first now we're not talking about the Israel I've preached that okay that's seiling you and I that's they're going to see us all right but we're going to have to look back and see that what that ceiling was back there was that God sealed It Up Until the End time in the writing of the book he sealed up the Book of Revelation right right to wait until the end time and it doesn't mean that and I I've in no way emphasized that the the lamb coming from the church ages I don't believe the prophet is trying to express how that we give forth as much as it's what he is he had to wait a time to the writing of the book right because in doing that there would be no book to go to Israel had he not waited until we are written you understand the bride so he waits until the end time and then when he gets in the end time see then he can open the seals right now brother brand said we're seeing what happened in glory 2,000 years ago right amen back there but you see it wasn't brother brandham turning off the seals no no right and yet he was confused on those points right because he couldn't see it correctly and him being a prophet right right cuz he says we were listening to the breach last night he says that I don't know what those seals are that's right he said well he was just lying to you well then he's a lying prophet and that would make the wrong thing I don't believe that I believe he was right and he said he didn't see it cuz he got down on the first seal he said I was going to make a horrible mistake said because I was going to follow old notes you know Y and he said the Holy Ghost came in the room straightened him out all right and he saw the opening of the seals what after he saw the one true and living God if you'll notice when brother randam came back to Jeffersonville he did not know what the seals were that's right they were just you know what we think he walked out the first night and said well I'm just here I'll just I'll just take a topic preach well just preach one God I'll just take a topic and then he says well you know I can't get across our so I I just see a breach here you know try this preach right a breach you know I don't think so right I believe when he came back he done exactly what he was supposed to do he preached one true and living God you might ought to read the god in simplic you know the god in Simplicity and then the breach with this understanding with way going into the seals it would be good for you to read it this way read that God in Simplicity as being in the bases that he could stand on when it come over to the first seal and and the Holy Ghost could say what have you always preached he said have always preached one true and living God Jesus and the father is a self Same Spirit he said well okay now there goes the white horse rider another guy all right now what happened what happened brother brandom was dealing with revealing what was written in the book okay in the book he saw a lamb and he saw a lamb that was worthy so he talks about it being that it was and the lamb comes forth he doesn't speak there as much about the lamb coming from the church ages as he does after the seals break check me out then he begins to speak of where the lamb came from so now you're dealing with where the lamb would come from to reveal cuz it's already written and where the lamb would come from to go to Israel right all right Follow Me Now Jesus Christ is that lamb that was back there that lamb was signified as having seven horns and seven eyes that's right because it would mean then in the church ages that lamb would be produced by the bride that would be able to break the seals when you're going to Israel now that may me a little for some of you you may not think about it much but you know it just gives me something to tie together that I can see to go all the way across with it cuz you got to have a lamb to take the book to to take this to Israel you remember we going to give birth to who remember in the Old Testament they gave birth to Jesus Christ right now do you remember the message I preached we are to give birth to the grain of wheat the son of man because he can't go to Israel under that condition of Son of God he's going to have to go to Israel through two prophets right then they will see Son of God Son of Man son of David yes but he's going there to through two prophets the son of man that's going there is going to be the word made flesh right which as I said a moment ago and you were with me so let's see if you stay with me that we are the book we are the book that's going to Israel you following me amen we are the book that's going to Israel right we are the revealed word now I didn't say what everybody says about it I know in this message a great man preached and told me about it one time and he said them two prophets said that's going to be the a gentile prophet and a bride Gentile bride they're going to go to Israel for the Rapture now I didn't say that that's what somebody else said in the day he told me that you know what I said I said brother r said it' be two Jews so you do what you want to amen now brother R said they won't receive nothing but two Jews that's right but brother Dale Elijah was a gentile was Elisha a gentile no right Elisha was an Israelite was John the Baptist a gentile no John the Baptist was a Jew see everybody thinks they get something they line it up in their mind looks so beautiful you know it's got to be a gentile brother around and said be two Jews go to Israel that's right amen well I always thought Elijah was a gentile and he was but Elisha wouldn't John the Baptist wouldn't and them two over there won't be just put that in there won't you charie you see I have to think things over because I'm thinking in my mind all the time how that I can present something to you to keep it from being confused with other people's doctrines I don't believe the bride is going to go through Israel for the rapture we are Israel we are in Goan we're right now this is spiritual Israel brother randam was a spiritual Jew right we are Gentiles but we Are Spiritual Jews that's right right greater than the natural Jews Jew means God's chosen okay get on but follow me see the book is sealed back there John sees a lamb and writes about it it would have to have a meaning to be totally back there as the opening of the seal and then it would have to have a meaning in the end time to the opening of seals to take it to Israel that's why why Revelations 10:7 people don't understand it says one you know that stand one foot on land one on sea I'm not going to get there this message but I'll get to it later the bride goes up Revelation 4:1 and not seen till 1921 right but Revelations 10:1 the prophet said is the same thing as Revelations 1:13 right that's his quote I wouldn't know what I had to say about it but listen let me get on this in hurry see the lamb had to come forth to take the book right John saw that and he wrote it right right he saw a lamb come forth that wasn't a lamb with seven horns and seven eyes that was Jesus Christ right you'll notice in the reading there about the lamb coming to take the book it says he brother R said this is not a lamb said it's not that he said it's a man y all right because no man was worthy to take the book right the lamb was a man all right now that would be back there in the writing of the book and you see in the opening of the book but when you come down to this end time it's in Bride form she see she has seen in there seven golden candlesticks seven eyes seven horns getting ready to go to Israel from here from you and I it's going to Israel right all right but you see she's already shown in heaven let me see if I can get this in a hurry then the prophet as I said he misunderstood the seals he didn't know what they were do you know that even after the the uh in the seal book even after the seals were preached and in questions and answers he still messed up right he read Revelations 5 and said that is not the bride because his thoughts was that she goes up in Revelation 4:1 not seen until 19:21 he said that in a seal B so when he reads Revelations 5 I gave it to is number five and then goes on through a whole quote of number six of the seal book and when they asked him they said brother Brandon in Revelations vers revelations in Revelations verse 5 to9 who are those found singing with the lamb the book takes it are these the raptured Saints he says no no that's not the Rapture Saints even after he's done seen the seagull and everything cuz see his mind is on Earth the Bri's not seen on Earth from Revelation 4:1 to 19:21 all right so brother Ned Ivon was the one that said to brother randam and I gave it on down through here to you and it's on the internet with the notes you can read it cuz it's it's a page uh starts at 500 through 501 on over to 502 and I think it goes to 503 yeah 502 of the seal book the questions and answers they asked him that question was that to bride he says no but then he turns around and something goes wrong he says there's something wrong there's a problem there something wrong he stops and backwards and forth read down to there he's going through he can't figure it out brother Ned Iverson said cuz I know that's he told me that's who it was he said read your question over when he read question over he said see there look said the holy spirit is keeping me straight he said this is not this is the bride he said c Us in glory and we'll reign as kings and Priests C Us in glory see he already seen her there in the Rapture all right now I gave you the notes to where that you can go with it of the seal book and where the the uh church is absolutely raptured and she's not seen between Revelations 4:1 and 19:21 that's what I said you said a moment ago you know I say well you said well what about Revelation 10 Revelation 10's in between there Revelation 18:4 is in there you know what Revelations 18:4 is come out her my people well you know that's talking about Israel what it's talking about you and me right Revelations 10 1-7 you said well that's brother brandom brother brandom said it was the same as Revelations 1113 one standing in the midst of seven golden candlesticks where about the pass with the golden girl he's standing one foot on land one on sea people you say yes but but but brother Dale this Revelation I've always said Revelation not Revelation 107 was brother brandom it is in the basis of the bringing of the Revelation but it's going to Israel from here they must have a part of Revelation aans 10:7 that's right the days of the voice 10:7 what of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be revealed you know as revealed to his s but if you'll notice the word it starts with what's the first word that's in Revelations 10:7 I just quoted over it but I didn't say the word it says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel John is taken all the way over to see this and writes and he said how in the world am I going to get these seals back to the bride that don't put brother brandom over there no they don't put us over there right he said but in the days in other words but in the days he's looking back cuz he sees the seventh Church age Messenger as a prophet right but in the days of the voice of the seventh Angel when he shall begin to say and all the Mysteries will be completed it don't put us over there amen because we go up in Revelation 4:1 well don't brother random go up with us Revelations 10:7 sure shows you the seventh angel messenger yes but it CHS him as the basis to where it says but the mind of John goes back to Revelation 3:14 the angel of the Church of lady right right right and he says Now the secrets can be made known to the Bride of Jesus Christ by way of the seventh angel did we sat in a meeting one time about that and some people there boy they were just you have seen them passing notes to me about it and I said but brother you don't understand you're tearing up the message cuz the prophet said it y he said the bride goes up Revelation 4:1 and not seen until 1921 but see it shows how perfect we are folks get that I I'll leave the rest of it I'll come back to it sometime maybe review this afternoon that I wish youd take this message and listen to it over again go I said some things in it that I didn't intend to say and really I didn't know how it would go together because you got to write the book and then there's got to be a book Made Alive the book that was written back there is now made alive in the Bride of Jesus Christ the words in the book which is Christ through all the church ages now it can go to Israel from here amen once we leave out of here the same book they don't have to get another uh you know edition of the Bible you take this book but to Israel will be shown that this book is Made Alive by the Bride of Jesus Christ right the Living Word is Christ in her right that's what it's showing showing her going into Rapture in chapter 4 shows her in chapter 5 as Saints shouting Glory Hallelujah and singing come on musician singing and worshiping showing her and how perfect she is you don't know how perfect he is read the book of Revelation you know how perfect you are correct English you know read the book of Revelations look at the Book of Revelations and see who you are well I don't know it's all in symbols well then ask the prophet what the symbols mean right right I mean after 40 Years of studying the message we ought to be down to the basis we know what the symbols are right or maybe we don't get it by reading G omic you know our love story magazines and things or newspapers you don't find a revelation of Jesus Christ you might find them talking about something brother Randon said one of these days they'll put it in the comic strips well you've seen the comic strips where be who were the the little fell you know there the Snoopy and peanuts and one of them said but I thought Elijah was supposed to come that's right it was written in the comic strips right guy was going through with a sign the end of the world here and he said but I thought Elijah was to come he said you'll read it in in the comic strips right then you have let's Stand Together amen but think about these things raptured Saints raptured bride or bride in heaven because that's where we are now right I thought we believe that we were resurrected sitting in Heavenly places that's right in Christ Jesus already raised I is don't feel like it that's where you're going by your feelings keep on you'll just die and go by the grave that's right and hope you come up let's see think on these things the Bible shows you how perfect you are shows you what God thinks about you he thinks so much of you he's going to take you not you physically not you he's going to take the word you give birth to and he's going to go to Israel and show them the Lord Jesus Christ go ahead brother anybody have a need 161 inp nations are breaking Israel Awakening that
