list is amen hallelujah amen we're going to chase over from open the eye does my heart know open the eyes of my heart open the i want to see you pour out your power and love if we sing kind of a funny thing for a pastor to be in the bed 24 days come out and tell the songwriter to cut the service short but it's not my fault he should not have made me sick that's right thanks mike might have been another few services or something to what i want to become but i appreciate all of you for praying and uh and why she you know she kept on asking me see you boy we got to get you the doctor i said well i've done been and everything but it didn't seem to be working but every monday night when everybody got to pray in 30 minutes my temperature went from 100 to 4 10 to 99. it's over don't worry about it sure i went to the doctor monday i mean tuesday i went over to the doctor sure he gave me a couple of shots and all kinds of things but that bothered me didn't bother my faith either see gary when you said it said you said it would be a way you just want to try a little bit you know hold on don't look at it when it don't happen but don't look at it bad when it does happen all right we won't read ephesians 1 tonight because we've got a long reading proverbs the 8th chapter kind of an odd reading now for what i won't speak on because we're going over to the book of job but this is a very odd reading because what my point is i want you to see that what we've been trying to say and we won't be on the so you take the notes on will you now what you want to on what we were talking about attributes and thoughts and things like that we will not be using them tonight that's why we we've moved over all right because after thinking about it quite a while i believe that you've got enough understanding about thoughts and attributes and things we'll mention it a little but then we'll try to move on into something else but i want you to see how that someone would catch a thought and then it's like wade said what what does god first do first does it reveal it you know and then makes it manifest all right now so in that we want to see you know that you can see something but sometimes you have to wait right for the answer to come to what you're doing and all like that but that's that's just what we want to do so let's pray father we thank you we ask you to just be with us tonight in your love give us strength but most of all give us spirit spiritual understanding in our hearts and our minds we love you we thank you thank you for a group of people to stay with you and pray for you when you really need it lord and just teach us that understanding let your love be with us in jesus name all right this is the whole chapter i said i was going to use this on the weekend and have brother collier use it as a you know for a responsive reading because it'd been so long but now i want you to get the point as you're reading through here with me this is talking about wisdom all right but now who's wisdom so you'll see him keep saying i i me i wisdom it's not the wisdom of man's mind see that's right this just read with me and think about what it says if you've got a scofield bible it says in praise of wisdom all right but that's what we need wisdom now not natural understanding we need revelation that's right yeah all right so let's read now does not wisdom cry and understanding put forth her voice she stands in the top of high places by the way in the places of the past she crowded the gates after entering the gates after coming in in at the door see if you just read one of these scriptures by yourself you think somebody's standing by a gate so i'm doing this somebody doing that but get it wisdom is coming in all right and it's talking about wisdom unto you o men are called and my voice is to the sons of men i think that'll defeat us oh ye simple understand wisdom and you fools be of an understanding heart here for i speak of excellent things and the openings opening of my lips shall be right things for my mouth shall speak truth and wisdom is an abomination to my lips all the words of my mouth are in righteousness there is nothing forward or perverse in them they are all plain to him that understandeth and write to them that find knowledge receive my instructions and not silver and knowledge rather than choice gold wisdom is better than rubies and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it i wisdom dweller prudence and find out knowledge of witty inventions now wait a sunday when we get on that okay the fear of the lord is to hate evil pride and arrogancy and the evil way in the forward mouth do i hate counsel is mine and sound wisdom i am understanding i have strength by me kings reign and princesses princes decreed justice i made princesses rule and nobles even all the judges of the earth i love them that love me and those that seek me early shall find me amen riches and honor are you are with me yea durable riches and righteousness my fruit is better than gold yay then fine gold and my revenue than choice silver i lead in the way of righteousness in the midst of the paths of judgment that it may cause those that love me to inherit substance and i will fill their treasures the lord notice big capital possess me in the beginning of his way he possessed in the beginning before his works of old i was set up from everlasting from the beginning or even or ever the earth was when there was no depths i was brought forth when there were no fountains abounding with water before the mountains were settled before the hills was i brought forth well as yet he had not made the earth nor the fields nor the highest parts of the dust of the world when he prepared the heavens i was there amen when he set a compass upon the face of the dead when he established the clouds above when he strengthened the fountains of the deep when he gave to the sea his decree what the water should not pass his commandment when he appointed the foundations of the earth then i was by him as one brought up with him and i was daily his delight rejoicing always before him rejoicing in the habitual part of his earth and my delights were with the sons of men now therefore hearken unto me o you children for blessed are they that keep my ways here instructions and be wise and refuse it not blessed is the man that heareth me watching daily excuse me blessed is a man that heareth me watching daily in my gates waiting at the post of my doors for whosoever find it life and shall obtain favor of the lord but he that sinneth against me wrong hit wrong with his own soul and they that hate me love death you may be seated the lord had a blessing to the reading of the word i wish you would go over that you better bring back some water too we should go over that reading and just you know just keep going over and over and uh because you'll you'll see more about especially this coming sunday of what i want to speak on like i said the devil shouldn't have got a hold of me because you know it gives me too much time to lay around and think and i love to think so you know like i said if i didn't get enough on that attributes and thoughts then uh just remember what we were trying to bring that god's attributes is his word it's his person and we we believe that he was a healer a savior a redeemer and he had those attributes always he didn't gain attributes coming this way he displayed attributes coming this way creations etc displayed the attributes but he always was a father a savior a healer if we believe in one god he would always father son in the holy ghost it was just that he had never displayed himself upon the earth to a human mortal and he had never uh you know sickness had never come into being healing these salvations and things had never come into being but that didn't mean that it wasn't part of him because he gained an attribute coming here then that would add to him as we were trying to say and that he cannot unders cannot add to his understanding he is not like you and i as a people you know he can't have a thought and have a better thought or a better idea or concept he can only you know do then what he says and that we can depend on it if you find it in the word then you can can actually bring god on the scene the prophet said and said call him a liar now that's that's hard words for us human mortals call you said if he said if you find it in god's word you can call him on the scene and said if he doesn't do it he said you can call him a liar you say well that's too strong that's no what is it i mean do you want a lot you know i mean would you lie to save your own neck of course 99.99 would but you know a christian or not even think about whether they lie or not that's right you know that's that's just the way we it shouldn't be it shouldn't be any thoughts in us because god won't lie but his thoughts are eternal and part of him well then if we ever had eternal life if we ever if you know if we have eternal life tonight the prophet said what we always was eternal what not us not our being i gave you those quotes not what we are you know by spirit and soul beings that comes over into the fallen condition but that eternal life that we have in us never had a beginning so it's you know keep it into that thought all right and all that we're talking about now has been taking place before the foundation of the world that's right all right now before anything was the things we've been talking about were already there and in doing that i want you to to listen especially to the first three quotes and then i want you to record them for for a background or a thought upon where we start on sunday because this will do one of true things this will open doors to the understanding or it will close the doors that's why i read that of wisdom see wisdom is a great thing even natural wisdom even human wisdom it's a great thing there's people who have photographic memories but you know the biggest problem with them they don't have enough sense to open the door but they got a photographic memory as far as what they read and and things like that in here well i'd rather be like me at least i can open the door but the lord has to take my memory and keep it straight don't you all right but now see this tonight will still be up in heaven so i want your thoughts in the beginning to be upon one thing that there is just one true and living god there can't be a trinity and it can't be as the people of the messenger making it now a twoness or whatever form of saying that jesus was one identity and god was another and you know trying to explain things and i'm not throwing off on them i've always told you that i never thought of i'd rather see somebody run wildfire than no fire i'd probably say it i mean you don't warm by a painted fire but at least you can get a little something out of one that's running out of wild you know so i'd rather see it i i i don't appreciate the era that anyone's in but i appreciate at least they're trying brotherdale's never been that away you know that from from every time you've ever seen me or hurt me i'm not against what these people are saying they're a lot better off than well we don't get the deep stuff now now we want to get confused so we just stay simple with the prophet's message and we just listen to what he has to say and and if you don't read exactly what he says it now you've missed it you know well all right that's everybody's place i was looking at something will be brought out the lord willing sunday that brother brown was talking about how that when this thing came forth it came like say that when it starts say the lutherans and the methodists and then the pentecostals and then the the going on into where we're supposed to be and he says there's the the the horse and buggy he said that's luther's name you know he said then the automobile maybe if i get these wrong you put them in the right place but he said like wesley in them you know it was like an automobile it was horsepower but he said then we hit the pentecostals and he said it began what would be known as the flying age of getting above ground resurrected he said sitting in heavenly places enjoying the things of god but he said we've moved on now we are into the astronaut age and he said in the astronaut age someone is going to have to fly off and he said john glenn went out you know and came back and thing but he said and he's bringing it out and in another message he says interplanetary travel which is not going to the moon would say like i think that's the exact quote so we'll try to get it that going to the moon would is a type of the rapture because see we're leaving these dimensions and going away but he said now don't blame the man right this up here said he's up here the astronaut that's right but he said you know what the guy's driving the horse's butt he doesn't understand he said he's life and said that can't be sold i mean even the guy with a car he said even the people flying into planes he said don't make light of them they've got their place we see this i don't make light of nobody all right so let's go along and get what we're talking about we know that for a certainty that there is just one truly living god all right and we're not oneness you'll see that more and more sunday as we try to bring it out we're not a oneness group of people we use the forms of god and the bride is to be the life form of god before the rapture comes that's right all right and then there will be a forum go to israel i've taught you that so we're not trying to get into a oneness form we're trying to get into what the prophet had to say so let's start with this reading you have to i'll read real fast tonight and if we're here at 12 i'm sorry and i i'm not kidding i want to get this out okay investments 1963 11 16 to be paragraph 60. he's talking about the policy of the talk and talking this morning it's eternal life everlasting life anything that's eternal never did begin therefore it cannot end eternal never begins and then the way the only way that you can be eternal is to receive eternal life and there is only one thing eternal and that's god not by joining a church or a creed or turning a newspaper on new year's you know wait till my new resolution or whatever it is but it's receiving god the person of god in the form of the holy ghost into your life and you become part of god and just as eternal as he is because you are you're a part of him everything has a beginning has an end the world begins it ends heaven begins you know that you know it ends but you better be careful right you might be surprised sunday we got bible jesus said heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never because he is the word he is the word and that is eternal okay one day shalom 1964 112 paragraph seven jesus no man has seen god at any time but the only begotten of the father had declared him see in other words god was identified the the person of god was identified in the body the lord jesus christ so he was ex the express image of god or god expressing himself through an image see through an image man god expressed himself to us and he was god not a third person a second person he was the person god he was god himself identifying himself so we could feel him first timothy 3 16 without controversy that's argument great is the mystery of godliness because god was for god was manifested or made known in the flesh isn't that wonderful god and we could never understand god as he moved through a pillar of fire and so forth as he did but we understood him when he become one of us see when he became become man then he could talk to us he could feel us handle us touches everything as the scripture plainly says that we have handled god see with our hands touched him with our hands now you know what i've always taught you the person of god how are you going to explain it when that brother branham would tell you the person of god is the baptism of the holy ghost that comes into you right every person in the world today 7 billion could receive the baptism of the holy ghost and that would be 7 billion persons of god amen and it'd still be the same person you agree he'd be the same person he wouldn't be another person because you're making trinities if he's a person we're a person there's a trinity you know what i've said the eternal life you receive the eternal life life i receive is the person of jesus christ all right so we better start believing that god is more real than we think i've got one in here somewhere but uh oh okay we'll go on this some of this one who is this melchizedek 65 221 the evening service notice those who have tonight eternal life was with him and in him in his thinking before there ever was an angel star cherubim or anything else that's eternal and if you have eternal life you always was look man not your being here right now it's plain enough not your being here but the shape and form that the infinite god and if he isn't infinite he isn't god god has to be infinite we are finite he is infinite and he was on the present omniscient omnipotent if he isn't god then he can't be god if he isn't then he can't be god knows all things all places because of his omnipresence omniscience makes him omnipresent he is a being he's not like the wind he is a being listen he dwells in a house no no he's in my heart amen because the house is in heaven too god being the mission knows all things makes him on the present because he knows everything that's going on there can't be a fleet that decides but what he noted and he noted because before there was a world how many times did time it bat its eye and how much tower it had in it before there ever was a world that's infinite we can't comprehend it in our mind but that's god god infinite amen all right now that's one lock it in and you'll see that when we come through at sunday it'll be lord willing if i can make it through it the way that i see it we'll see a whole lot more than we've ever seen about the godhead and we'll see a whole lot more than we've ever seen about us heads that's right but number two do you believe it's a heaven well a lot of people thanks all those things to do is come down here i'm talking about people in the message you know hell's here and this is here and that's there and everything you know but do you really believe in heaven being real a real place so much greater above this until this is a garbage can a cesspool the most beautiful you could go and i love to hunt to work especially going somewhere that you hadn't been and you get back into the woods or something and just they're in colorado and just just walk down through there and think lord it's so wonderful to be out here ain't nobody around for miles and then about the time you stumble over something beer can he starts off talking on things that are to be 1965 1202 and he start talking about how the old-timers used to be about living about heaven and about the things and all and and if i'd i'd ask you a question to go look up for sunday brother random said paul went to the third heaven he said i went to the first there's two opposition quotes you better hold close together when you get in there because one of them is talking about a dimensional situation and one of them is talking about the millennium brotherhood said i went to the first heaven the prophet said the first heaven is the millennium the first earth is now they pass away okay you better listen now if i was one time in your life i'd lay my heavy fields down put them in my seat on my bridges and set at home if brother dale's done anything in the 35 or 40 years that i fasted mostly if i've done anything that you think was wrong against you i'm sorry forgive me i don't want no problems does it matter who's right and wrong your husband's wife have divorces because both of them think they're right the only thing that asks your question is please answer this and i'm standing here shaking because you are the people that pray for me to come through but i'm the person that's got to tell you the truth whether i like it or you like it men are women here tonight if you were standing in this pulpit preaching tonight and i was sitting there in the congregation and looking like most of you do come on if i sit there looking like most of you do when the service is over you'd everyone line up and want to know what's wrong that's all i say sorry that petty feelings got involved forgive me but what would you do if i was sitting there looking like you look while i'm up here you say well it don't matter yes it does i'm sorry i believe that heaven is a real place just the same as this is a real place see for god started us in our spiritual growth in this place i believe that heaven is a place just as real as this where we don't set dire for eternity and just sit there on a cloud we don't just strum our heart for all all from here ever but we're going to a real place where we're going to do things where we're going to live where we're going to work where we're going to enjoy we're going to live we're going to life going to real eternal life we're going to a heaven a paradise just like adam and eve worked and lived and hated and enjoyed in the garden of eden before sin came in we're on our road right back there again right back the first adam through sin taken us out the second atom through righteousness brings us back in again justifies us and brings us back in now here's where did i hurt feelings because you've already got your computer that i've taught you most of it and you're saying brother dale we're not going to heaven we're going to the future home that's coming here i'll remind you that what i just read it right is in 1965 the future home was preached in 1964. i wrote it on the side of your notes you might not be able to read that but it means the future home was written in 1964 or preached when it comes down is it going to do it with everything this is an odd way to get to a point that i'm trying to make but it's the best way i know how to do well brother dale what does heaven consist of according to second peter 3 and 7 the heavens are kept in store i want the word of god 1 16-17 all things that consist they consist by the word remember the future home comes down out of heaven to this earth amen does that annihilate heaven don't annihilate too quick because remember revelations 19 14 through 16 says that we ride back with him on white horses out of heaven am i in the bible amen yeah but you're destroying my thoughts oh good amen because i thought that we believe that they're on the river jordan it wasn't all this mix-up situation but it was the god of heaven uniting upon the earth did that do away with heaven right but you see you're gonna have to think you're gonna have to think and keep your mind straight because you're gonna let your computer cut me off and i can't hit that i can't help that part i have to get over it because i realize if you don't see what i'm talking about the next few services some of you will be leaving i pray for that in my heart but you remember you go out of this door ain't nobody ever went out of this door that this man don't steal love i loved everyone and always who loved everyone it hated me and got me wrong i've never had them many that in my mind of hatred against any of them and done everything i could to try to hold together and you've been with me and a lot of it so yes right you ordered helmet listen let's move on now let's go to job 38 and i wrote this on the time for you because brother brown said joke 37 37 but it's 30 38 verse one through four verse seven we'll just start at seven because we'll get back to this let's go verse one by yet then the lord answered job out of the whirlwind and said who is he that darkeneth counsel by words without under without knowledge see what he needed wisdom right who is he that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge gird up now thy loins like a man for i will demand of thee and answer about me where was thou when i laid the foundations of the earth declare it if thou has understanding who hath laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who has stretched the line upon it whereupon are the foundations remember in proverbs you talked about that are the foundations there are fights and or who laid the cornerstone thereof when the morning star signed together and the sons of god shouted for joy so where were we and we've been using the ephesians 1 according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world now let's get these two scriptures together where were you in the morning start saying together and the son of god shouted for joy and let's get it together with ephesians let's let letter branham do it number five on your notes israel 1953. 325 israel and the church thank god for richard uh we always say joe's and they're doing it richard's back there now and man yours heard about it took the whole service of the day to get all those together for me to preach on sunday morning on attributes and thoughts and i didn't even read one of them so we tried to do you know hold off and read later out of it but bill didn't get half of that but they're running them like crazy at least they're on the internet systems they're out there and they're here for you so you you have it thank god for them i appreciate them everything that's ever done whatever it is thank god but listen israel in israel and the church number one 53-325 now watch according amen here it is i hope it really i'm going to let it soak in right real good because it'll do good it it'll it may be go plumbing to the bones cornets he had chosen us who did i heard it and i come no no you never he had chosen hath highest tense has chosen us the church in him how long ago paul last week or when you heard held the revival no before the foundation of the world now he can ride on that cloud see he done what he chose us in him christ before the foundation of the world and look so it can't be anything outside of the eternal life we've been talking about the cross that's where the choosing was at it's not that he was choosing upsides and deciding who to save and what was to do and it wasn't as even i've tried to bring to you it wasn't that he was looking down to see who had won it right around said what could you do this is hundreds of billions and billions of years ago that's right well it's just in his mind we remember his mind is greater than our mind his mind is his attributes and his thoughts and who he is so keep it in mind that's right well look what you're said which we have a little time now he's covered uh chosen in him wish we had a little time to go to job 37-37 which is really 38 4-2-7 see where see there were he said where was you when i laid the foundation to the world before i laid the foundation work declaring me where you were they're facing their face and they are where was you when the morning started staying together and the sons of god shouted for joy telling job buckle up yourself like a man i want to speak to you another man said that made job get to the basis that he could see something and said he wanted some way for somebody to come and take god and man and bring them together he said it wasn't long so he said buckle up stand up i know my redeemer liveth amen something happened because of his desires amen because of his desires all right but just remember that when we were chosen in christ so it's not accused not ball team to reject one and accept the other there was no choosing in the basis of who to choose in this he chose to come this way to bring his family into being i can't have it if he gave me a part of his life to make this family i can't help being a dale i didn't have anything to do with it you didn't have nothing to do with yours sure we accepted jesus christ as our savior sure he was looking at that through predestination four knowledges and we'll cover all of that later for when we get down to earth but we're still in heaven we've got to bring that heaven and earth into a being to where we can see what's going on right and that's what we're trying our best to live background tonight to get to to get the point all right why we are not a denomination preached in 1958 927 paragraph 241 and then before there was respect of life on this earth our bodies were laying here hallelujah before one drop of moisture was ever moisture ever come on the earth we were laying here when adam walked up and down in the garden of eden i was laying here amen yes sir now he's talking about your body oh glory when the cherubims the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy i was laying here just waiting for the breath of life to come i was here he made me here had my body laying here yes sir it isn't where you come from my how did it get it excuse me it wasn't where you come from my how did it get done god laid had it laying here god made it and we're made out of the seven sixteen elements for trolling possession and said we were laying here that's right now he's talking about him we got a few scriptures that's supposedly into a lot of people but we won't get to him until sunday and a quote from brother brown that is confusing to a lot remember what i said the other day he asked job where was he joe couldn't comprehend but we better be able by now to begin to comprehend where we were and what was going on before the foundation of the world not as people yeah i read you the quote not our being here but has that eternal life of christ as a part of our father to be his offspring his children mighty arrest you to find out that brother branham said the seed on this earth was here from another civilization there is a doctrine among mankind that says that they that he was people before adam and eve a world a people before adam and eve people were created it just records adam and eve being created i don't agree with it but i do know where those seed come from that's right white had to be shepherds 1964 12 20 or 12 22. the first time angels ever sang in a celebration it was in heaven now we got nothing down here where he sang i said the same one where he sang on earth when the baby was born but you better listen now this sort of answer who the cherubian you know the uh angels morning stars sang together angels and the sons of god shouted for joy all right angels singing angels were created way before right come on the first time angel was ever saying the celebration it was in heaven if you look in job 8 38-7 as i see something you taking notes when god first planned on making his first creation the earth job was a great smart man and he had all kind of wisdom he said when i go up to the markets the young princes they all bow down before me and just one moment of my wisdom he couldn't figure out why he had to be treated the way he was listen so god asked him gird yourself up like a man because i'm coming down to talk to you and when you remember he said he that counts with wisdom and things over here we read the first verse or two and when god came down in a whirlwind he said job where was you before i laid the foundation of the earth when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy where were you then job and he was deflated at that time where was you means you didn't understand right right see the first time angels ever sang in the celebration was in heaven but the first time that they ever sang on earth was the shepherds at the birth of god emmanuel on earth the first human beings ever heard an angel sing was humble shepherds an angel singing morning stars saying together don't go away i know what morning stars means also it means the children of god but it means angels so why would you be dealing with morning stars why would god bring up morning stars as people right and sons of god as people right you get me he's covered they're angels angels are created first serpent seed 58 928 evening service paragraph 82. i want to ask you this job 27 38 when he said where was you when i led to foundation of earth when the morning started saying together and the sons of god standing for joy who were those who were those sons of god that were shouting for joy now he tells you who they were jesus told them now who are who were the sons of gods that were morning stars signed together and the sons of god shouted for joy who were those sons of god that was shouting for joy jesus told them that i had joy with you before the foundation of the world we're not creatures of time we're creatures of eternity no man can come to me except my father draws him and all that comes to me i'll give them eternal life and raise him up at the last day no man can pluck him out of my hand he said why you're afraid why are we afraid this thing was over you don't find out in a minute when we get through readings huh this thing was over before the world ever begun that's why they told me the first come into the message they said you can't get saved because redemption was over in 63. say oh everybody teaches that i said i'm sorry i just realized i'm not born again well i'm too late i'm sorry buddy you know but when it come around to 69 and god gave me the baptism of the holy ghost i said you come and kill me now that i'm not safe come on you might argue my mentality but you will not argue with god's word you see oh this was over before the world ever begun because that's what i told them then i said look according to bible salvation was over before the world ever begun i read the bible before i come into the message that's what i study that's why i don't read it now as much as i need to i read what wrote around says about it compare it and go back because my memory is still decent about what i read when i was in the baptist church and i read then that these verses was ringing in my mind i tell the baptist i told the preacher i said listen the bible don't say he that believe if you believe he said he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved right they didn't like it they don't like it now but i'm sorry it's something inside of me it's not me i love you but i'll still have to tell my wife my kids my grandkids my great-grandkids i gotta tell you the truth we're not going out of here on a sugar tip thing over a change we're going his way we're saying by the grave that's right that's the choice we've got if i go it means i didn't make the place but i will argue over some quotes with you if you want to don't argue too much don't jump up with your computer too much because you're going to tell me that brother branham didn't have rapture in faith now he never reached a change but he sure spoke of it you tell me paul he just never reached it it was not time did jesus have rapture in faith why do you have to die see just don't don't come to me i'm sorry it's just i'm just making this away and if it's your benefit praise god for it but ain't forget it go somewhere else and help somebody else and i appreciate everything anybody has ever done around here witnesses preaching 1953 403 the evening service prayer at 140. someone said the other day said brother billy are you still preaching some kind of some of that new kind of religion you got that's what i told you everybody thinks we got a new kind of religion right everybody says that's a new religion look what he says let him answer it i said no sir i'm preaching the oldest religion there ever was and the only one there really is and got salvation in it they were deflated some of that new kind said we didn't have that here a few years ago you know that's what people say i said let me tell you brother it's older than the world is that's right job said where were you when i laid the foundation of the world when the morning started saying together and the sons of god shouted for joy millions of years before the foundation of the world amen we so listen to the rest of them why we're not a denomination 1958 927 paragraph 283 in god's book he's done said he'll meet me right you right there there ain't all devils out of hell can keep me ever keep him any worry they will out of hell can ever keep him anywhere else but keep him from coming right there see that's it'll keep them from coming he'll keep you from coming for a while but that'll stop you and they don't stop you no because god had already said so and that settles it it's a hundred billion years before the world was ever formed the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy before there was a foundation in the world they see four before before there was a foundation and them angels and everything was happy shouting about it before there was a foundation of the world how's the devil ever going to keep me in the dust of the earth he can't do it you're right spiritual amnesia 1964 411 1964 paragraph 88 89 and 90. to be a christian you have to be the same we don't want to forget that all that he was i'm identified with him i'm identified with him notice and he is in me and i in him notice that every christian that's a real genuine christian christian was with him when the morning started saying together the sons of god shouted for joy before there was a foundation of the world we were identified in the immortal realms with god now listen 10 million years before the world was ever formed i was back there with him if i got eternal life i was there with there with him i was identified with him when the morning starts singing together and the sons of god shouted for joy i was with him when he called abraham see everybody loves to come down to earth you know i was with him when he was abraham i'd wait a minute david i was with him now listen he just said was with him back there in the same phrase i was with him when he called abraham at the age of 75 years old and his wife being and told him they were going to have a baby i was with him when he took his stand on thus saith the lord i'm going to have the baby i stood with him every other christian stood with him i was with him when he with his i was with him with him when his temptations come i was with him when he went up on the top of the mountain to offer up isaac i was with him when the realm appeared with doesn't seem a strange word anymore right can't just eat it right or something's messed up that's right but you know brother brandon when he gave the emphasis to get over to the bride of christ he wouldn't use the word emphasis uh with he'd say in right i was in him in a shorter gallon i was with him when he went to california i was with him when he resurrected no i was in right now i was in i could be with abraham let's get a little bit differently don't worry questions and answers on genesis 53 7 29 paragraph 61. now the first man now he made the first man in his image and we're returning back to that image that's right to our first created image remember now you say create it mean it had a beginning not if it's part of him jesus was the beginning of the creation of god which meant what he was almighty god brother branham said god was his first creation am i in the prophet's message see our computer's click that we can make it say what we want to would bring it with the rest of the word so when god created me william branham i was before the foundation of the world he made my being my spirit i wasn't conscious of anything as far as i know of but the i was there oh i don't don't believe you're getting it but now just a minute jesus told the disciples that he knew them before the foundation of the world and paul said here that he chose us in him before the foundation of the world now there was some part of me armand neville and the rest of you all here that's in christ jesus before the foundation ever be before the world ever begin and here's my analysis of what that was now you go study that if you want to and you'll find that he goes into the creation of angels and shows that one-third of the angels fail and they give us the nature but the other two-third of the angels which most of the time run around will quote two-thirds for some reason he'll quote two-thirds of the angels fail when the bible says one-third of the anger will fail i'm not correcting him any corrections don't say if he says it but what does it make any difference see what we argue with it what is it two-thirds one there what which one do you think i think two-thirds i'm going my way you go your way i'm getting that stupidity right he said i wasn't conscious of anything as far as i know of but i was there i don't believe you're getting it but now just a minute jesus told the disciples that he knew them before the foundational world and paul said here that he chose this in him before the foundation to work now there was some part of me armand the rest of you all here that's in christ jesus before the world ever begun all right now back to his point and you ought to run this in and listen to what he says a lot of times and you'll find out brother branham was a pretty good human being i don't mean this wrong but it's not in the one i'm using but yeah i get to admit but around a good human being we think he's so immortal what about where he was letting a little nurse just rub his back and all he was in was for some tests and if my wife comes to the hospital room that some of you thought i guess i was there the other night and i'm sorry we didn't leave that get out because that was the time god was doing his work but the little nurse is rubbing brother brown's back my wife come into this she said let's not take care of that myself i mean i trust her that much but we find out we're all human what kind of a new religion brother branham what kind of a new religion do you have in this message people what kind of new religion have you got what kind what's something new we didn't have this years ago you know we've never heard of something like a prophet coming we've never heard of serpent seed we've never heard of of all of these doctrines you have of predestinations and and marriage and divorce and and all these things we're just sweet little humble people that goes to church and wants to go to heaven and you come and told us we're all gonna die and go to hell if we don't get out of them denominations is it a new religion is this a new thing a man came from california i'll just say man came from california years ago out here and he wanted to take over because he told me he said i come out here preach wednesdays me and this other brother said we'll preach wednesday did you preach sundays i told him i said i got nine preachers you're preaching your rotation so with the other brother i said y'all preaching rotation and i said let you preach the wednesdays and things yeah but i thought i'd come out here to follow this new thing follow this lula thing i said that's where you messed up yeah doing a little thing it's either god or not god right so ain't no lulla thing but that's the way people think suburban church age 1960 1246 paragraph 58 look little did israel know when they were standing out there on the bank shoddy you say this kind of religion is something new why it's the oldest there is sure even before the world was ever made they were shouting and praising god god said so ask job where was you when when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy that's before the world was ever created i will restore 1953 1110 paragraph 38. and any man knows that the angel of the covenant with jesus christ that's right that's saying yesterday and forever god unfolded himself down that was god in that pillar of fire he unfolded himself down into a human body virgin born no man can touch him there you could see him here but he's a virgin born right now he went away a little while in the world shift me no more yet i'll be with you even in you same god living right down unfolding himself into the heart of man got down here where he could shape him and give them a rejoicing like job did they said brother branham that's the new kind of that's that new kind of religion huh it's just a new case of the old time all time why god asked job where was you when i laid the foundation of the world when the morning started saying together the sons of god shouted for joy before the foundation of the world ever was ever this ain't something new is something old it's the beginning you remember the background phrases of most of what i'm reading to you is what about the the first time he run into the like jesus name people or something to the one that's formed with people and as he was and the man got up to preach you know how he come down the horizontal rainbow and all like that he said man i wish i had what he had all right but look white had to be shepard 64 12 21 paragraph 92 let's see wait a minute i've read that okay x that one now oh i flipped pages excuse me that's what i've done the other day when i was reading one it just slid down i just read them right off the next one let's get this and we'll get through maybe we'll hey we're going to make it we can say all right we ended on the 14th all right this is the one where brother branham the rejected king 1965 15 the morning service and brother branham is in the hospital he's getting ready for some tests for going overseas and he he's um this nurse is coming in and she said you know and said may i rub your back and make you feel a little better with the alcohol he said and i see it you may do it and while she was rubbing my on my back she said what denomination of church do you belong to and i said oh i belong to the oldest denomination that there is she said what denomination is that i said it's the one that was organized before the world was ever organized oh she said what i don't believe i just know just that she said i belong to a certain church is it that organization and i said no ma'am that was only about 200 years ago that organization but this organization started when the morning stars staying together the sons of god shouted for joy when they seen the coming of a savior to redeem mankind what made those angels sing even though they were not lost they were rejoicing about what was going to happen who was it and where was it or what could it be in what form could it exist that we could shout back there are you thinking why is it why did the prophet emphasize that it seemed the coming redeemed this is an eternity pact let me quote around in the beginning before the eternal that's the best quote i like about right here when you say in the beginning before the eternal now when we say eternal that's as far as our mind can comprehend but brother brown went back into the mind of god and brought out the things of god that he saw before the world ever begun where was you when this was taking place if you wasn't back there shouting maybe that's the reason a lot of people don't shout down here maybe that's why this message has become a bunch of sad sick-hearted people and even physically sick maybe it's because we don't realize who we are but you know brother i got it right across here but brother dale you sound just like you talking about like brother so-and-so because he said we would ever want up there in heaven i don't know what he's talking about right i ain't concerned about what he's talking about i ain't concerned where he was telling the truth or not because i told a lot of them and asked them simple little questions and found out they wasn't they talking about this guy you're looking at this guy you looking at was now that first chapter he shout now jesus christ that walked a short galilee i'm on a tree before this world ever begun but he didn't hang on it until 2000 years ago but in god's mind it was already done and finished right oh well there's been something we're just mortals and we can't comprehend but wouldn't it be something that if you could have set back his way he was talking wednesday night on want to kick him because he's getting too close to what i wanted to bring out but wouldn't this be an entirely different world if we come down and he was using dick and gale so i used that three kids wouldn't have been something brother dick if you'd have knowed first thing knowledge you got whatever year would be you know two or three whatever you there's knowledge you got one day i'm gonna have three kids they're inside of me and i'm gonna have three kids i'm gonna name connie and ginger and brad and then he finds a beautiful little girl running around he begins to talk a little about wedding and he says gail when we get married we're gonna have three kids still there's gonna be two girls and one boy gonna be the boys brad two girls she injured connie she knows that they're gonna have three kids and then she went into the doctors and the doctors told her physically you know what this i'm sorry but you can't have any children if you go home you know what she'd say he said dick you're gonna have to marry somebody else who's gonna have three kids because i've just been told the news that i can't have no children brother dick would be the head of the house the man the things like adam in the garden and eve you get the picture tying it all up and he'd go back and he'd say okay i read about abraham amen he said he's 100 years old when he got a child i said sarah was 90. so somewhere between here and there we're going to have three kids and said let me tell you the rest of the story he said sarah passed off and said abraham had about seven more kids we said all you gonna get because we know what abraham and sarah didn't have a warrant that was it he didn't have no more promises that's right it didn't matter if they went back young he could happen by others he couldn't have him underwater no more by sarah because that was it yeah man all right see it this isn't god's promise get the point of what i'm talking about so when brother dick is a little over here running around in school this little boy was cussing and fighting he said let me tell you i'm going down through here again let me tell you we're going to have we have three kids their names are connie ginger and brad well now three kids what do you think he's gonna be thought of if you really believed it would it hinder you you know are you sweet they wouldn't hinder you are you not asleep which one it wouldn't hinder you would all right see that's right all right i'm trying to get a point to you where you believe it or not he was rejoicing because his family was coming and every member of his body would vibrate shake it just trembling because he knew the plan of redemption would come remember what i said the other day we'll get to it one of these days god created that form that was even back there that we called the word god in other forms he was a father but that was not what he wanted he created adam that made him a father but not what he wanted that's right did you just see all with inside of that word form the rejoicing of each one of those that would realize realization that one day you see now you're getting it too close i'm not got it close enough yet that's right those inside of him would be saying one day we're going amen not something to volunteer not daddy send us on there let's not just die no no no no go to that mankind they try to make trinity some thoughts out of it they say jesus stepped over and said i'll go no he came himself that's right there's rejoicing going on those angels that love deep they look at him and they see in his mind and open it and they see him so in a real that they've never seen him before right i say what's going on he said i was just thinking about my family yeah any man that's right yes sir just thinking about my family when they've seen the coming of a savior to redeem mankind i'll remind you something at this time of what we're talking about i tried to make it god stepped over into another form to create he had already created angels because they were first and at that time the angels had fallen the one-third of the angels had fallen gone to a place that will get to sunday go to a place to do their haddock yep that's right can't you see it adoption 2 1965-18 prayer f151 so beautifully displayed in the prodigal son i was lost this is my son he was lost and now he's found he was dead and he's alive again bring forth the fatted calf the best roll of a ring and put it on his finger unless no matter where the morning starts no wonder when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy when they sing the plan of salvation god put in your name on the book before the foundation of the world you started writing yep there's not anything in the lounge book of life sex and eternal now we're talking but names and it is not your earthly name james right we'll get to that little random said it was your name before the foundational world that's right amen before the fall so we started writing down names and this is nice oh glory oh inside of him all the names oh fact let's get it inside of him all of them that knew their name they begin to rejoice he's probably running all over heaven amen you're trying to do away with it is what i see the people that manchester trying to do away with all these things oh heavens down here hell's up here come on folks as he wrote their names john run around and say it saw his name in the book amen you believe amen that's why he was shouting he didn't see john run around what is it he said not herman neville he said it's what takes place on the earth see because you've got a book of life and the lounge book of life sticks section two sections your prophet has taught these things we didn't have no way of knowing none of these things this is not something new it is the bible your prophet taught it why don't people read what he said that's right that's right why can't they want to keep the holy ghost be there he tells me sickness whatever 4 30 this morning i woke up when i did he was there he'd been married telling me things i just got in i saw them leave matter of fact i went there told you guys maybe something wrong because i've seen a lot turned and i guess i said we'll find out and i will wait and get some i thought maybe it doesn't go to the hospital or something you know because i thought a car went out but i couldn't find out it wouldn't see it just like turned around but wait drives over there clocks pick up somewhere close to that 7 30 percent pick up timbo i called him on the phone i said hey you up now it's where you have on the porch and i'm

went on to speed he always does he got you too huh thank you yeah but now listen this is adoption singing when they sing the plan of redemption god putting your name on the book before the foundation of the world serpent seed 1958 9 2018 in service paragraph 1 dear god the great and mighty god informed all things by the power of his spirit and has brought jesus christ his only begotten son who freely died for we sinners we just the judge for the unjust to reconcile us back into the marvelous fellowship that we have again with god and as we thought on the blessed word that we had fellowship with him before the foundation world when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy way back before the foundation of the world how do we know that that wasn't at the same time that the lamb was slain that when god in his great thinking seen us shouting and rejoicing in our salvation that's right he wrote her name down i get it that's why i put him in order he wrote her name down and then one came to die there was a lot of rejoicing going on you said brother dale that looked like a lot of people around up in the nerves nope still just got one form and that's the word brother brown said if you wasn't in that word form you will never be there amen you said brother dale i've heard you preach this many times you have but you never heard it like you heard it tonight but the grey's got the tapes he can bring the flame to he's going to because i've never seen it you say we've we know all about the seals the message the bible the the godhead the the marriage and divorce we know all of these things we are just touching the iceberg of what the prophet taught us while he was here called did i bring anything to not contrary to what he said if it did come and tell me right now no this is not a new kind of religion this is the oldest religion there ever was amen amen when the morning stars signed it together and the sons of god shouted for joy why would it say that if they wouldn't somebody a first shot why would it say as it did it was rain written if it wasn't something written why would it say the lamb stood as a slain before the foundational world if it didn't happen you'd write it that it all took place here we know it's got to take place here i'm shouting my religion and it's the oldest there is in the world i found out who my daddy is too right and you see i don't have a bit of trouble calling him god do you well not brother dale no god is no object to worship you see billy paul walked up to the room one day this is according to him now you maybe heard him testify that brother branham was down on his knees praying the man that taught us all of this about god and the object of worship and honor and he was down on his knees and he was praying papa god papa god you know that my kids always call me daddy but you know one day there was a little boy named joshua come along he called me paw paw well you know what kids started calling me papa because they wanted josh to call me papa you know you know but then they called me paw they would know more say daddy now they knew how to say daddy now they wouldn't be in the store holder paw paw well they would because they don't turn around but you know they say daddy and they're still all that sorry father's all steals our husbands still there you know but you know hannah bubbles come along i can't remember really get the whole thing between hannah bubbles and hannah you know and matthew because one of them started saying something the other one went up saying poppy well you know what i wouldn't pop all them over that's poppy family got bigger well abby grace come along no zach come along excuse me zach may have been the one to come in with it when did he come in there and i'll have fun right here's what's poppy okay there was another name or two in between in there because we always changed it so many days i'll get the line back but i'm just trying to think and he called me poppy whatever i called it poppy you know if you know josh will still call me paw paw and you know hannah and them they stay with that but they stay up they're getting bigger you know and zachary he'll come in he said poppy but you know abby grace come along they kept trying to tell her to call me poppy she said pop she likes to shorten things she don't want to play around with them words and she would say pop well we hadn't got figured out it yes what deanna's got into but see she's popped so far so but she'll probably move in and say something else one day when she does within a little aced he'd come along he may find something else if you understand what i'm getting at it's what you are two people personally you know grandmother granddaddy great-grandmother you've been ready husband wife children we all know those little petty things so where's where's debbie hey how many pumpkins does poppy have he's got two pumpkins all right deanna's sitting over on the other side deanna she's saying it too i hope he's got two pumpkins but tomorrow how many little puppy house so it's just one thing one big happy family one big happy thing because we all can run the dna back and find about see who belongs to who because god's dna runs back to his children that's why i thank god for luther and what it was he might not understood a lot but and i was just saying maybe i didn't finish what the whole point while ago but luther couldn't say anything about the rapture hardly at one time wesley didn't talk about rapture but all of it was living in life and being christians azusa street more jumping up and rejoicing but still falling right back down and you know and doing but in the astronauts it's going through space in the thought of a mind i like to read thanks sounds crazy to you but always makes me think of something i always wondered about dreams i finished the message of just talking here quoted 25 to 9. i've always wondered about dreams basically everybody here has dreams but would you answer honestly that we have bad dreams you ever have a bad dream even vulgar even wrong things yeah you know that's always worrying because why because with my subconscious because that's where you dream and would my subconscious be wrong and they have a wrong dream or a wrong thought would that mean that the real me is lost you don't ever think that you're not concerned about your dreams and your things a lot of your dreams is about your past right now i was reading what the doctors had to say about it came home found what brother brown had to say scientific doctors say that dreams are based upon the part of heights implanted or in burning of your memory brain and that your dream what you've done in the day now they didn't mean that you would dream exactly wade dream he's going down cutting grass see don't get that idea it's something that happened in life and science says now this is what the man had to say he was supposed to bend a big one on it he said when you actually go through a day he said you're going through it so fast until it says your brain waves can't burn together it took me 16 years to learn to ride a bicycle burns well about 14 to ride a bicycle 16 to learn swim i pretty slow playing water from the time i was a kid dove in it and everything in the world almost drowned a couple of times they had to pull me out it would happen but they say that your dreams is your endings that when your memory comes together it's like burning ends together and once it's burnt unless something severs that you can be 80 years old and if you're not godly you know might not get you training when you're you ride a bicycle you drive a car because those ends burn together dreams he said is because that those things in that day didn't get matched up so it left an open but yet it's still in the memory part it just didn't burn together to be all what it was supposed to be but he said some of the other things it gets through and you know you can just remember everything to happen because that's dementia or what you call a big word you you lose your your which one you lose your short-term memory when you've got the alzheimer's you lose your short-term because it doesn't burn together see and it can be pulled apart as we just call it i'm just trying to say something god i found what brother rather said they say this don't burn together so you left there and he said then dreams is from your conscience and your subconscious a combination now all right brother adam is the one saying this now he said dreams happen between the conscious and the subconscious and he said even are called to nightmares he said because you're conscious and your subconscious is fighting one another and you're not together he said diaries where they knew there was something different about me he said because mankind is born with those conscious and subconscious separated and they must come together and burn in and make the things and he said if you're in between there he said you're you're in a world of do it and i can even show you where he was talking that's what it was in hell hell is not a person laying in a burning pain he said that's not true he said it's like a fallen thing if you ever had a dream you just fall and you fall and you're falling but he said there's where a prophet said his consciousness subconscious was together i shouted i said god now i know that just because i have a bad dream it's before fortnite choice danny says joyce will wake up this life and like that talk to her she now she's told me this is really gonna say it she might not like it but she said she loves to drink she's shaking her head so i think she said she loves to drink i get so tickled sometimes with my dreams i was telling sister barbara i had one another day and she was in it but i've been on a trip and was coming back and i come in to pick up my clothes that's the dream i come in to get my clothes like the airport and i was getting ready to go down through there this this officer he wasn't a dress uniform policeman you know he's like an officer i remembered man he had gone that long and he was standing there and i started to get my stuff he said i'll help you well i knew what he meant and i turned around and looked at him and it's a crazy dream but i'm just telling you trying to get a point to you because i'm not a prophet my conscious and self-conscious is separated i looked at that man you know what i'm saying that's your own life because i hope the man if he ever hears it but i said do you know bill cutting him most everybody here does he said yes sir and i'll hit we get my stuff and we start out a lot of people in a bad place i knew i had to go we'd been hunting i had to go get my gun and i go over but our sister barbara she's looking down at me she sees me i don't make no contact with her because i didn't want her to get involved down here you know but she sees me i told her i said you stay praying for me enough something i'd pay back a drink that's that's something like i'm saying but i go up and you know the guns that work you know it was laying out in the grass under an old tent and this guy was down with the guns and i said sir is there some sort of certain kind of gun rifle he said yeah here it is he pulls it out when he does here's four guys three guys standing at one big one he reaches for the gun and he says here i'll take them for you and i just got into my hand and it was on bricks you know we're done bridge and i just unbridged it and haven't had that many shelters i don't know had a whole bunch of shells that done been fired so that's a dream you know i reach over the pouch and i get to one more and i slide it in when i pulled my thumb off it had also been fired but that guy didn't see it i just closed it up put my hand in i said i don't think you will well he backs off and i take off sister barber's watching me go and i'm running off the only thing i said in the dream sister barbara i said surely she'll come up there and help me get in my car because i knew i had to go from where it was back up here but i'm just telling you i've always wondered about dreams why would they be vulgar to me man i dreamed of whipping the kids maybe me and i'd take a stick and i mean i'd rub her back like this and i'd go get him and i couldn't hear them i thought this is crazy they done wrong they need a weapon that maybe was trying to tell me they didn't you know i need to do that but he ever had vulgar dreams right see him trying to hit me the prophet said it's because the two worlds the subconscious and the conscious and not got together and part of it is what you've done in this life but if it ever connected together you'll never forget what you've done in this life and i wish i could right i wish i could marry my wife when i was 16 years old when she was 14. i wouldn't have the troubles of life you see i'm just trying to tell you that god was with me all down through there he was with me and i saw him in that church he was with me when he brought me in this message he was with me one day when i stood a 30-yard stick something that's right close to it reached down and went off at the tree blow it back into my head i couldn't feel i just realized i put my hands up that nothing wouldn't blow it apart i couldn't hear and i couldn't feel nothing to see it with me because i had pieces of lead where it hit that tree what if it hit a knot anywhere in that tree all across my forehead you see god stick with us you say do you believe in i ain't children i've done preach to you the bible says the angels of god are encountered about those and the religion says the angel of god is encountered about those who fear him you know if you're an era of salvation tonight the day your body struck the earth that angel was there yes sir how'd you take care of you brother dean brother donny brother colley jumping out of airplanes with a few little cords holding i wouldn't know that in this thing when they come to me they call him john my whatever he was i wouldn't call him toronto and they showed me how to fly i'm just saying think of all the things that could have killed you before god found you is not going to be destroyed the bible says it is preserved in heaven well brother dale when we get the future home being hurt don't you agree yes sure well what do we need to happen for i want to go there i want to see where my father lived before he started this plan to bring things down here just

knowledge but even tommy's made it pretty good come on brother think of these things thank them these times the oldest religion that was ever in the world the beginning that when god shouted in heaven and we shouted with we wasn't with him we was in him i hope you take a little illustrations because i never went that far because i never seen it that far i just want to say we say we know the word but the word when it just keeps unfolding how can you stop it what if man had to stop when he first got to you know morse code and had to run wires all over the country you could never contact anybody overseas you had to send a boat but you know like a while they got with these late cables and they run them across and they could then they got where they could cobble can do things now all you gotta do is pick up a cell phone and call china downtown whoever you want to call and even though it may be 12 hours different somebody answer your phone right it's a great thing to realize realization
