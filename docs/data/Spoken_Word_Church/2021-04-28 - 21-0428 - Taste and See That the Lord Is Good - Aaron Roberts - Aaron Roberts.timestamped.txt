[18:32] blessings on us
[18:34] i uh
[18:39] i want to give a little of a bit of a
[18:41] testimony and
[18:43] actually a couple of testimonies let's
[18:45] take a few minutes and
[18:50] tell you about some things and
[18:56] i'll give you a little update i uh a few
[18:58] weeks ago
[19:00] uh the end of last month i asked for
[19:03] prayer for a little boy named nahum
[19:05] meisters or our neighbors or
[19:10] we went to school with his mom richard
[19:12] and i did when we were
[19:14] years ago in north carolina and uh
[19:17] he's palm sunday name had a
[19:21] he was on a swing that was on a limb and
[19:23] the limb broke and hit him in the head
[19:25] and he had severe brain trauma
[19:29] and
[19:33] you know
[19:36] he was in bad shape and uh
[19:40] they had to life flight him to charlotte
[19:43] and uh just the
[19:46] the lord just moved on the scene for him
[19:48] and
[19:50] that's nahum and his mom her name's
[19:52] sunshine
[19:54] and then there's another picture of him
[19:56] brother joe's got that's him
[20:01] but when they thought when they got him
[20:02] to charlotte they got him to the
[20:03] children's hospital in charlotte the
[20:06] doctors
[20:07] were trying to prepare sunshine and her
[20:09] husband todd
[20:11] for the fact that nahum may not make it
[20:17] and so it's just been a burden on my
[20:20] heart
[20:21] but i just want to thank the lord to not
[20:24] he's doing better
[20:27] he is
[20:30] as you can see he's he's awake now he's
[20:33] uh
[20:34] still got a long way to go but uh
[20:38] sunshine and if if y'all want to y'all
[20:40] can
[20:41] see i got some of the posts on my
[20:42] facebook page if you want to see it
[20:44] sunshine's got
[20:45] all the on her facebook page but uh
[20:49] it was it was you know when things like
[20:51] this happen you
[20:52] start to wonder why you know why this
[20:54] happened and you know where's god in all
[20:56] of this and you know
[20:57] you know uh you try to have faith in god
[21:00] and it's like whether you know all
[21:02] everything's stacked against you
[21:06] but the thing is is god is a very
[21:08] present help in the time of trouble
[21:13] his name's nahum and is his mom said the
[21:16] lord gave her a scripture
[21:17] nahum 1 7 says the lord is good
[21:21] a stronghold in the day of trouble
[21:24] and he knoweth them that trust in him
[21:30] that's what struck me is it's nahum 1
[21:33] 7. he's six years old and if you go from
[21:35] one to seven that's six numbers
[21:38] and seven is the number of completions
[21:40] so
[21:41] i believe he's gonna be okay
[21:44] just just give you a few run down they
[21:47] had to life flight him out
[21:48] to charlotte and one of the paramedics
[21:51] came by saw sunshine and told her said
[21:53] we didn't think we was going to be able
[21:54] to fly that day
[21:55] because the storm was coming in and we
[21:57] only had a 20-minute window
[21:59] to get the helicopter off the ground and
[22:02] said we didn't think we'd ever get off
[22:03] the ground
[22:04] but the lord held a storm off
[22:08] so they got in the air
[22:11] and uh there was a she tells the story
[22:15] about
[22:16] that one of the paramedics was a combat
[22:17] medic in
[22:20] either iraq or afghanistan and was uh
[22:23] was on the scene and
[22:27] she had been contemplating cutting back
[22:29] the number of hours that she worked and
[22:31] she hadn't and she just couldn't figure
[22:32] out why
[22:33] she just wasn't comfortable with that
[22:36] but she said that day she said i
[22:38] realized she said if i hadn't
[22:40] if i had cut my hours back she said i
[22:42] wouldn't been there that day
[22:44] when nahin got hurt and so you know
[22:47] you look at things like that god's
[22:49] always got people he always works
[22:51] everything out perfect
[22:54] but she was uh she'd been talking to him
[22:57] and they took him off all of the
[22:58] sedation and he hadn't opened his eyes
[23:00] or
[23:01] responded in any way and she was just in
[23:04] there talking to him and
[23:05] singing to him and everything and one
[23:07] day he opened his eyes
[23:09] and she was talking to him and he turned
[23:10] his head toward her
[23:12] and so she knew that he was there later
[23:14] on she said that they were talking to
[23:16] him
[23:17] the doctors were giving him the
[23:19] prognosis and what his treatment was
[23:21] going to be later on and she said i was
[23:23] in there holding his hand and the
[23:24] doctors were talking to me
[23:25] and she said i realized that i wasn't
[23:28] holding his hand he was holding my hand
[23:31] so she knew something the lord was
[23:33] working on him and
[23:35] and so when she told him what had
[23:38] happened
[23:38] after he had his eyes open one day she
[23:40] was talking to him he'll realize
[23:42] she told him what was going on he began
[23:44] to cry and he began to
[23:46] get fearful and she said that was the
[23:47] first time that she had a response from
[23:49] him that he
[23:50] like a like a six-year-old would he was
[23:52] scared of what was going what was taking
[23:53] place and she said she realized that
[23:55] he's there with her but he's in and out
[23:58] a lot
[24:00] and but
[24:03] he's been able to open his mouth and
[24:05] follow some commands at different times
[24:07] and
[24:08] they were cleaning his mouth out one day
[24:09] and said his head fell
[24:11] forward and she put it
[24:14] put her hand on his head and he was
[24:16] trying to raise his head back up so
[24:18] he's he's conscious some to know what
[24:21] was going on but it's just
[24:23] every little thing like that you just
[24:24] praise god for so
[24:27] and uh you know we went to school with
[24:30] them
[24:31] and then there's many other ones that
[24:32] did too so uh
[24:34] what amazes me and what blesses me is
[24:37] every time i go in there and we see all
[24:38] the updates
[24:39] is how many message believers because
[24:41] she went to school with message
[24:42] believers going to christian school she
[24:44] taught in a christian school
[24:46] and she taught message believers and
[24:48] their children and everything so there's
[24:49] a lot of message believers
[24:51] and so there's been a lot of the bride
[24:52] of jesus christ been praying for
[24:54] nahum and so just thank the lord you
[24:56] know
[24:58] god puts us in in a pathway and we don't
[25:00] know why
[25:01] but you know
[25:05] there were people talking about sunshine
[25:07] and what a blessing she had been and
[25:09] everything
[25:10] and the other day i was thinking you
[25:11] know the bible says cast your bread upon
[25:13] the waters
[25:14] and it'll it'll return to you so we
[25:17] never know why we cross people's paths
[25:18] but
[25:20] you know sometimes god has a greater
[25:22] plan we don't see
[25:23] but i thank the lord for him touching
[25:27] him and
[25:28] y'all just continue to pray for him and
[25:31] we just believe that one day he'll be
[25:34] old
[25:35] so and
[25:40] i about a year and a half
[25:43] to two years ago i had a as a man at
[25:47] work he's a good christian man but
[25:51] uh he come to me one day and asked me
[25:53] said i won't talk to you for a minute i
[25:55] said
[25:55] sure so we
[25:59] were off and he began to talk to me
[26:02] about some things that was going on in
[26:03] the plant
[26:05] and he said i
[26:08] he said i didn't just ask anybody
[26:11] he said i asked people that i had
[26:13] confidence in their prayers
[26:15] and he said i want you to pray about it
[26:17] so i did so we started praying
[26:20] i got prayer claws and i took them to
[26:23] work
[26:24] put them in the plant for the last two
[26:27] and a half
[26:28] you know year and a half two years we
[26:29] hadn't seen anything change it just
[26:31] seemed like that
[26:33] but i want to thank the lord today that
[26:36] the last few weeks we've really started
[26:38] seeing changes take place
[26:41] things started changing and you know
[26:43] it's just
[26:44] you you ever you know we talk about it
[26:47] in
[26:48] different times we you say you look at
[26:50] things and you wonder
[26:51] you know you pray for things and then
[26:52] when things happen you're shocked that
[26:54] they happen
[26:56] and sometimes when they when they happen
[26:58] you know because you see something
[27:00] and it's been so long that you've been
[27:01] waiting on this that you that you're

[31:38] so god bless you tonight that's the end
[31:40] amen
[31:41] amen y'all have your seats god bless you
[31:44] amen but uh
[31:49] last time we were speaking on
[31:52] talking about
[31:57] the scripture we were last time
[32:01] talking about the uh began to talk about
[32:04] the manna
[32:05] that fell in the wilderness and how god
[32:09] gave to the people what they had need of
[32:12] and it was perfect for their time and
[32:16] you know even though it was it was
[32:19] perfect and it was exactly what they
[32:22] needed you know the people began to
[32:24] murmur and complain about it
[32:26] you know there was a there was a
[32:27] conditions on what they had to do
[32:29] to to to harvest or or reap the
[32:33] the manna that fell every day and you
[32:35] know they couldn't hold it over but they
[32:36] had to go out every morning and get it
[32:39] and you know and it becomes such a a
[32:41] common thing but it was a
[32:43] a supernatural event that took place in
[32:45] their lives and you know they began to
[32:46] murmur and complain to moses about what
[32:48] was taking place and
[32:50] you know god
[32:53] was blessing them but they didn't see it
[32:54] as a blessing but you know
[32:57] god told moses to tell aaron and he went
[33:01] out and told aaron he said you take up
[33:02] an omer of this
[33:03] manna and he said you put it in in the
[33:06] holies of holies there with the ark of
[33:08] the covenant
[33:09] and he said you know you you store this
[33:11] up
[33:12] and it was a
[33:15] memorial it was a covenant unto the
[33:18] people
[33:19] and that every generation beyond that
[33:22] every priest that came to the
[33:24] came to into the priesthood was able to
[33:26] eat of that original manna
[33:28] and so they were able to go in and that
[33:30] manna was in there in the
[33:32] manna as in the beginning the manna
[33:35] would rot if they if they tried to hold
[33:38] it over but when it
[33:39] came into the shekinah glory in there
[33:42] with the ark of the covenant
[33:43] then it lasted forever and it never did
[33:45] cease and it never
[33:47] it never rotted and it never went out
[33:48] but it was always
[33:50] full of of the of manna that was in
[33:53] there and so every time that they would
[33:54] go in there they were able to get
[33:56] exactly what they had need of and you
[33:58] know when you when you look at the ark
[34:01] of the covenant you know
[34:02] it's called the ark of the testament and
[34:04] you know it was a testimony because
[34:06] in the scripture god tells moses he says
[34:09] no this will be a covenant this is going
[34:11] to be a testimony
[34:12] to the people see the people were the
[34:15] ones that broke god's word
[34:17] they didn't believe god it wasn't that
[34:19] god wasn't faithful to them they weren't
[34:21] faithful to what he believed
[34:22] and you know when you go back into the
[34:24] scripture and you and you read the
[34:26] scripture
[34:26] that you know they were the ones that
[34:29] god told them
[34:30] what to do and how to do it and you know
[34:33] and he told them that
[34:34] when you're coming up and you're on this
[34:36] journey he said you know you follow what
[34:37] what i tell you to do and what moses is
[34:39] going to tell you to do
[34:40] and you know but they began to get lacks
[34:42] and they began to get cold and what was
[34:44] going to take
[34:45] what was taking place and they wanted to
[34:46] do their own thing and they couldn't
[34:48] ever get egypt out of their mind
[34:49] and out of their view but they never
[34:51] could get in view
[34:53] what god had in store for them and you
[34:55] know here they are when
[34:56] when god began to talk and and you know
[34:59] they were afraid because moses had spent
[35:01] so much time in the mountain
[35:02] getting the law and god was speaking to
[35:04] moses and and giving the word
[35:06] and they were so laxin and their in
[35:08] their uh
[35:10] behavior and their and their doings that
[35:12] they didn't even care that you know they
[35:13] began to worship idols
[35:15] and you know they had the golden calf
[35:17] and began to act
[35:18] just like all the people that were
[35:20] around them and just began to act like
[35:22] you know
[35:22] so like worldly and everything and they
[35:24] didn't even care about what god was
[35:26] doing that god was trying to lead them
[35:28] and in the midst of all that you know
[35:29] moses got mad and he took the
[35:31] he took the tablets and he broke the you
[35:34] know he broke them on the our
[35:35] of the uh golden calf and you know then
[35:37] he had him crush it and then
[35:39] you know you added it to the water and
[35:40] made them drink it you know because and
[35:42] then god took him back on the mountain
[35:43] and he gave him another
[35:45] writing of the law and he brought the
[35:46] other law down to him
[35:48] and you know and then he put that in the
[35:49] ark of the covenant and that ark
[35:52] when it stayed in the ark of the
[35:53] covenant see that was a testimony
[35:55] why because every single time that they
[35:57] looked upon the law those tablets that
[35:59] laid in there
[35:59] that was a rebuke to the people because
[36:01] the original ones were broke
[36:03] because they were out worshiping idols
[36:05] and so here they are they had this one
[36:07] and then when when they when they were
[36:09] in the wilderness and they lacked
[36:11] food and they were you know worried
[36:12] about how they were going to get through
[36:14] and what god was going to do
[36:15] to them and how god was going to take
[36:17] care of them and they were so
[36:18] regarding regarding god how that how
[36:21] they just were
[36:23] so disrespectful and didn't have faith
[36:26] in what god was trying to do for him
[36:28] and not honoring god and their in their
[36:30] their
[36:31] uh work and conduct
[36:34] everything that they've done and here
[36:36] they are god was trying to feed on manna
[36:38] and they
[36:38] and they failed to believe what god had
[36:40] to do you know every time even when they
[36:42] needed water
[36:42] everything that they had need of god met
[36:44] their needs and he took that omer and he
[36:46] put it in the ark of the covenant
[36:48] and that was because it was a testimony
[36:50] against them it was a testimony that god
[36:52] was faithful to them but it was a
[36:54] testimony to them it was rebuked to them
[36:56] because they did not believe
[36:57] and when he took when he took aaron's
[36:59] rod it was because they did not believe
[37:02] that god had called aaron and the
[37:04] levites to be the priest
[37:06] and to the position that they were in
[37:08] that they did not respect and believe
[37:10] what god had told them
[37:15] and so he made the test and he told him
[37:16] he said okay that's fine he said each
[37:18] man
[37:19] each tribe has a rod and they were
[37:21] supposed to put it in the shekinah glory
[37:23] and he said then what it'll prove to you
[37:26] why because
[37:26] each tribe had to bring their own stick
[37:29] they had to bring their own rod and he
[37:31] said you have to write your name on it
[37:33] and so they placed it in the in the holy
[37:36] of holies
[37:37] in there and then god came down and he
[37:39] he manifested
[37:40] and so he uh
[37:44] he uh chose
[37:47] showing the people which one that he had
[37:49] chosen was that it was
[37:51] aaron that he had
[37:55] received him and so he uh
[37:59] caused the rod to bloom and bring forth
[38:02] almonds
[38:03] to prove to the people that that was
[38:06] god's
[38:06] choice because each one of them had
[38:08] brought a dead rod in there
[38:11] and there was no life in it why because
[38:13] they had handled it they knew what that
[38:14] it was dead they knew what it was they
[38:16] put their name on it so they knew that
[38:18] it was dead
[38:18] and there was no no you know it wasn't
[38:20] some kind of cheap magician's trick
[38:22] but it had to be the supernatural take
[38:25] place and it budded
[38:26] and it blossomed and it brought forth
[38:28] those almonds and you know what when it
[38:29] was stayed in the
[38:30] in the ark of the covenant you know what
[38:32] it never did lose its almonds it never
[38:34] did lose the blooms
[38:35] all of that stayed right there why
[38:36] because it was a rebuke to the people
[38:39] but it was a testimony to god
[38:41] to the people that god was true to what
[38:43] he said he was going to do
[38:44] and every time that the people wanted to
[38:46] come against god you know he always
[38:48] rose up and he always tried to show to
[38:51] the people
[38:52] and prove to the people what he was
[38:53] going to do when every time they asked
[38:56] him
[38:56] he was always faithful to them he never
[38:59] was against them
[39:00] they were always against him they
[39:01] couldn't keep their mind on on the right
[39:03] thing and they couldn't keep their eye
[39:04] on the journey
[39:05] and they're overcoming because they were
[39:07] so tied up with all the things that was
[39:08] taking place all around them
[39:10] but so so when all of this took place
[39:13] then when god when they come to kalish
[39:14] barnea then it come to the final
[39:16] judgment they had to come up
[39:18] and make a decision whether they were
[39:19] going to go over or not
[39:21] and when all that god had done through
[39:22] you know taking care of them
[39:24] and nobody was sick and their clothes
[39:26] didn't wear out and all the things that
[39:28] god had done through them and they show
[39:30] god showed them all the way through how
[39:31] faithful he was and he made a witness to
[39:34] them with the with the pillar of fire
[39:36] and the cloud and everything that took
[39:37] place
[39:38] the brazen serpent everything that took
[39:40] place god was faithful to them
[39:42] and they failed to believe what he had
[39:43] to say and so when it come to that place
[39:45] then judgment came on them
[39:47] why because that was all god could do
[39:49] god can only bring you so far
[39:50] and then you face judgment
[39:54] and so that's what happened they come to
[39:55] a place that when they when they gave up
[39:57] then that's
[39:58] all god can do he said he told him he
[39:59] said your carcasses will rot out here in
[40:01] the wilderness
[40:02] he said but your children he said your
[40:04] little ones who you think will be a prey
[40:06] he said they will rise up and go in and
[40:08] take the land
[40:10] so he rebuked them but you know he he
[40:12] brought them all the way
[40:14] and he tried to show them what exactly
[40:15] what was what he was trying to do
[40:17] and he was faithful to him the whole way
[40:21] and brothers and sisters god is faithful
[40:23] to us he's always been faithful to us
[40:25] but the problem is is do we believe do
[40:27] we have our s are
[40:28] our minds set do we have our hearts that
[40:30] do are we completely sold out to what
[40:32] god has done
[40:33] have we so completely sold out to god's
[40:36] plan
[40:41] so each time as we were talking last
[40:44] time
[40:44] each time the priest came to age
[40:48] and was able to enter in to the
[40:50] priesthood then he was able to go back
[40:51] in there and eat that
[40:52] eat a part of that original manna you
[40:56] know what a
[40:56] what a wonderful time that you know when
[40:58] this man was able and and had went
[41:00] through all of his training and all the
[41:01] things that he had went through in his
[41:02] life he come to this place
[41:04] and then he was able to take part of
[41:06] this supernatural
[41:08] this this amazing thing that was there
[41:10] that that you know
[41:11] you know because many times you know it
[41:13] was just something hey we talked about
[41:14] these things and and we've heard about
[41:16] these things but you know all of a
[41:17] sudden it become
[41:18] psyched it became is really a reality to
[41:21] him that he was able not only to sin but
[41:23] he was able to taste that
[41:24] and you know and then you know begin to
[41:26] put into your mind those
[41:28] all of our ancestors they were back
[41:30] there and god brought them out to us
[41:32] through a strong hand and he brought
[41:34] them through all these miracles and
[41:36] he brought them all this way and you
[41:37] know what they failed to believe
[41:39] they failed to come in and they are
[41:42] eating that be able to eat that manna
[41:45] what a wonderful thing that to be able
[41:47] to eat that
[41:49] but you know brother brother brown
[41:50] talked about you know that in time
[41:52] you know when when jesus came and died
[41:56] and the veil was rent then we know that
[41:58] that the access was open it was not just
[42:01] to
[42:01] just to the priests back then as as the
[42:04] veil was closed and everything was shut
[42:06] off but when the veil was written too
[42:07] then there was
[42:08] access to everyone because through the
[42:11] through the new birth
[42:12] and the the body of christ as we come
[42:14] into the body of christ
[42:16] then we all have access to that and so
[42:18] when you enter into that
[42:20] then there's always access to that manna
[42:23] that word of god is always
[42:25] available and so it was just so not like
[42:27] back then where you could only come at a
[42:28] certain time or whatever
[42:30] but now it's day night whenever and we
[42:32] can come boldly before the throne
[42:34] and we always have access to the word
[42:36] because now we've all became priests and
[42:38] kings
[42:39] before god that we could all have access
[42:43] and so now we all can partake of this
[42:46] manna
[42:48] so the word of god has been open to us
[42:50] that we all are able to
[42:51] partake of this man this supernatural
[42:55] word that god has blessed us with
[43:04] but like he said you couldn't hold over
[43:07] you can't hold over you know because
[43:11] you know there was a message that was in
[43:13] the past
[43:14] and every every ages had it has had its
[43:17] message
[43:18] and god has blessed each one but you
[43:19] know when it come to our day
[43:21] then you know god has opened up
[43:22] everything in our day
[43:24] you know you know the opening of the
[43:26] word is coming our day and
[43:28] you know you know so many people as you
[43:29] know they've probed and and
[43:31] and tried to understand things and you
[43:33] know they they could only see just a
[43:35] portion because god had allotted a
[43:36] portion to each one
[43:38] but praise god in our day god has opened
[43:40] the word to us
[43:41] that we can see what god has done in the
[43:43] past and we
[43:44] understand these things but we
[43:45] understand what god has done in our day
[43:48] that god has opened up the full word
[43:50] that we're we're not we're not
[43:52] trying to trying to figure things out or
[43:54] or trying to
[43:55] have guests work or you know trying to
[43:57] take educated guesses or anything but
[43:59] you know we've heard god speaking our
[44:00] day
[44:01] and you know what he began to answer the
[44:02] questions that were in the scripture
[44:04] that were hidden all the way through the
[44:06] ages and that other ones could only
[44:08] probe at or they could only look at it
[44:09] but you know then god began to open
[44:11] these things up and now we can see
[44:13] that that the full revelation has come
[44:16] in our day
[44:17] but the thing is it's the same thing the
[44:19] manna has fallen
[44:20] but the problem is is do the people want
[44:22] to come and receive
[44:24] see the the manna has fallen so the word
[44:26] of god has been opened but the problem
[44:28] is is you
[44:29] he can only put the manna out there but
[44:31] the problem is is do you want to receive
[44:33] it
[44:33] you've got to come and receive from it
[44:36] and then we begin to talk about you know
[44:37] receiving the word
[44:39] you know when when the angel told john
[44:41] he said come and
[44:42] go eat the book and he said you know he
[44:44] said give me the book
[44:45] so you know he had to go up there and he
[44:47] had to tell to take the book
[44:49] from the angel but had to tell him i'm
[44:51] going to take the book give me the book
[44:53] but he just couldn't take the book he
[44:55] had to eat the book he had to become the
[44:57] book
[44:58] so when he began to eat the book then he
[44:59] began to work inside of him
[45:01] so the thing is brother sisters that's
[45:03] what we have to do we have to eat the
[45:05] word we have to take on the word receive
[45:06] the word
[45:07] to become the word and you become the
[45:09] word as you receive the word
[45:11] and so this is our day to receive the
[45:13] word
[45:14] not just to say that god sent a prophet
[45:16] in our day and god has opened these
[45:18] things but the thing is
[45:20] is when when we have you know 11 1200
[45:23] sermons and and we have
[45:25] we have it in every kind of form of
[45:27] media that you can think of
[45:29] and you know people still don't want to
[45:31] take time to listen
[45:36] and you know everybody you know and it's
[45:38] just like you you can't just cherry pick
[45:40] what you want
[45:44] you know we just don't have we don't
[45:46] because when he said you had to eat the
[45:47] whole book
[45:48] then you know it wasn't just we're going
[45:49] to leave it a little bit out here we're
[45:51] going to trim the crust off for whatever
[45:52] you know
[45:53] we're going to eat this so what no we
[45:54] got to take the whole book
[45:56] we got to take all of it and so you know
[45:59] we we can look
[46:00] in and try to you know uh take our
[46:02] portion and
[46:03] and you know try to put a little slant
[46:06] on it this way or that way but you know
[46:07] what
[46:07] that's not ever gonna that will only
[46:09] produce death
[46:10] the only thing that's gonna produce life
[46:12] he said man shall not live by
[46:14] bread alone he said but by every word
[46:16] that proceedeth out of the mouth of god
[46:18] and so it's every word that god has
[46:20] spoken
[46:20] in our day and that's the only thing
[46:22] that's going to bring you eternal life
[46:24] because you know many people you know
[46:25] they just want to take what they want
[46:27] and they just want to leave the rest of
[46:28] it but let me tell you brothers and
[46:30] sisters
[46:31] if you're going to leave something
[46:32] behind you'll be left behind you will
[46:34] not make it through because if you plan
[46:36] on going in a rapture
[46:37] you better make sure that you have all
[46:38] of it you have all of it that you have
[46:40] walked in everything that god has told
[46:42] you to walk in
[46:43] and it showed in the light god has
[46:44] showed you because you know what
[46:46] everybody thinks we're in a race against
[46:48] somebody else
[46:48] we're not in a race against anybody
[46:51] brothers and sisters you've got to be
[46:53] faithful i have to be faithful to what
[46:55] god called me
[46:56] i can't be anybody else you can't be
[46:58] anybody else but we've got to be
[46:59] faithful to the call
[47:01] gifts and callings are without
[47:03] repentance but the calling that we've
[47:04] received in our day
[47:05] we have to be faithful to that calling
[47:09] god has called us and so i'm not trying
[47:12] to be somebody else and i don't want
[47:13] anybody else to
[47:14] and god help anybody try to be me
[47:18] but let's be let's just be what god
[47:20] called us to
[47:23] that's be i don't want to be nobody else
[47:29] i want to be what god's called me to be
[47:31] let's be
[47:33] let's be faithful you know so many
[47:36] people
[47:36] so many people you know they spend all
[47:38] their time looking at other people
[47:40] they're looking around and they're
[47:41] saying well you know you know what about
[47:43] this one or what about that one and you
[47:45] know
[47:45] it's it's we get our eyes so many on so
[47:48] many other things
[47:50] you know as paul said you know laying
[47:53] aside
[47:54] all those weights and the sin that so
[47:57] easily beset us let us run this race
[48:00] god has called us to a race to run but
[48:02] so many people have got their eyes on
[48:04] everything else
[48:05] their their peripheral vision is so full
[48:07] of things that they don't realize
[48:09] what are you actually focused on what
[48:11] are you focused on then we need to focus
[48:14] on what
[48:15] god has called us to let's be faithful
[48:18] to that
[48:20] we need we need to be faithful we need
[48:22] to because god didn't call
[48:24] us to be in every every place and and
[48:27] and do all these things god called us to
[48:29] be one place
[48:32] you know how do you plan on being
[48:37] if god called us to be soldiers
[48:41] if you're if you're a soldier in the
[48:43] army of god if god's called you to a
[48:45] place
[48:46] you know tell me anywhere brother donnie
[48:49] was in in service and i don't i don't
[48:50] know anybody else
[48:51] in here was served but i know brother
[48:53] donnie was but you know when they assign
[48:55] you to a place
[48:56] they assign you to one place and you got
[48:59] one leader
[49:01] and you ain't and they ain't got nobody
[49:03] that just you know they're they're a
[49:04] hopscotch
[49:05] runny you know easter bunny running all
[49:07] over the place jumping from here to wall
[49:09] you know
[49:09] everything no they got one place to be
[49:12] you've got one place
[49:14] and you and you that's that's your place
[49:16] that you you're in
[49:17] this cr you know company or platoon or
[49:20] whatever
[49:20] and you're you're assigned to this
[49:22] division or whatever and you're you're
[49:23] you've got
[49:24] so everybody when they come looking for
[49:26] you they know exactly where you're at
[49:28] why because they just follow the line in
[49:30] the hierarchy
[49:31] and that's oh they're they're they know
[49:33] exactly where you are well see the thing
[49:35] is is
[49:35] everybody wants to be wishy-washy and
[49:37] they and they want to run here and there
[49:39] and do all
[49:39] you know how is it how are you supposed
[49:41] to be in the army of god when
[49:43] you know when you don't it don't even
[49:45] make sense
[49:47] he's like you know everybody well you
[49:49] know i ain't happy in this church
[49:51] i'm going over here ain't happy in this
[49:52] church i go over there i ain't happy
[49:54] there i'm over there
[49:55] you know there's bounce around here
[49:57] yonder everybody what church are they in
[49:59] this week or wherever they at
[50:00] and it's like well you know what now i
[50:02] don't even go to church at all
[50:06] we're in the mystical body of christ
[50:09] so we're just we're just going to sit at
[50:11] home
[50:14] you know it's how how is that because
[50:17] all through the scripture there is
[50:19] always a divine order
[50:21] well you know there's always then how is
[50:23] it that you know
[50:24] well i don't i don't have to fit in
[50:32] i mean even the prophet said that
[50:33] brother neville was his pastor
[50:36] talking about brother neville brother
[50:38] neville you know
[50:41] well i'm not going to sit under nobody
[50:45] you know there's i'm sorry to tell you
[50:48] but you know there's no lone rangers in
[50:49] the gospel
[50:54] everybody wants to be you know they want
[50:55] to be all on their own and you know
[50:57] they're going to do it their own way
[50:58] well you know what
[50:59] you you're just playing games you're not
[51:01] you're not actually because you know
[51:02] what there's a divine order because you
[51:04] know what everybody has to have headship
[51:07] and so if you're going to if you're
[51:08] going to be and grow because you watch
[51:10] people there's always they they people
[51:13] can know the quotes
[51:14] and that you know you can have all the
[51:16] pictures you can you can be full ahead
[51:18] knowledge
[51:18] but the problem is somewhere the way
[51:21] light's going to cross your path and you
[51:23] know what
[51:23] you're going to turn the word down
[51:26] because people struggle with that to
[51:28] understand you know what
[51:29] i have to have a pastor unless you're a
[51:32] pastor you've got to have a pastor
[51:34] that's the only way that you're going
[51:34] gonna make it
[51:35] i'm sorry i'm sorry everybody thinks
[51:37] they're gonna be superman and they can
[51:38] do whatever they want to
[51:39] you know they got it all figured out no
[51:41] you don't there's a divine order
[51:43] to how these things gonna take place and
[51:44] you know what because he said
[51:46] the scripture tells us ephesians 4 tells
[51:48] us that it's going to take a five-fold
[51:50] ministry
[51:51] that it's going to take a 5-0 ministry
[51:53] for the perfecting of the saints and
[51:54] without a pastor
[51:56] and without a five-fold ministry to
[51:57] perfect you i don't care what you say
[52:00] you can stand up and say well the holy
[52:01] ghost is going to perfect me well it's
[52:03] going to take you
[52:04] because let me tell you brothers and
[52:06] sisters if you don't
[52:07] have confidence in man then how are you
[52:09] going to trust what god is saying
[52:14] people talk about oh i have faith to
[52:16] move mountains i have faith i have all
[52:18] the all kinds of faith i can do but you
[52:19] know what you don't have
[52:20] faith to believe that god can speak
[52:23] through another human man
[52:25] you're like he can speak through the
[52:28] human flesh
[52:30] you don't believe that the same holy
[52:32] ghost that fell on the day of pentecost
[52:35] that that fell as cloven tongues upon
[52:38] 120
[52:39] and peter and then began to come out and
[52:41] speak the word
[52:42] and begin to point back to what was
[52:44] spoken by the prophet joel
[52:46] and began to express all the way through
[52:48] exactly what jesus
[52:50] told them that would take place then you
[52:52] don't believe that that same holy ghost
[52:54] can speak
[52:55] through a man today
[52:58] because you know what we're just going
[53:00] to stand back and we're just going to
[53:01] play
[53:02] and we're just going to get behind our
[53:03] little shield and stand back here
[53:05] and we're going to say well i'm just
[53:06] going to listen to the prophet
[53:09] well you know what there's part of what
[53:10] the prophet had to say that you don't
[53:12] have to
[53:14] we just move that to the side
[53:19] i'm i'm sorry but you know it's it's sad
[53:22] because you know
[53:23] people do not realize what what god has
[53:26] blessed them with in this hour and
[53:28] people do not want to receive that
[53:32] because all they want to do is point
[53:33] back and say would you see that brother
[53:35] over there
[53:35] he failed that brother over there he
[53:37] preached false doctrine
[53:39] that brother over there he done this and
[53:41] that's all they want to do they just
[53:42] want to look at scarecrows
[53:44] but you know when you want to point them
[53:45] back to some brother that stood behind
[53:47] the pulpit and has preached the word and
[53:49] god has ever had to step
[53:50] back and make corrections of what he had
[53:52] to say and he's always stood there and
[53:54] been faithful for 40 years
[53:56] nobody wants to listen to that because
[53:59] you know what they don't they don't have
[54:00] any confidence in that
[54:01] oh no he's just he's just intellectual
[54:03] or he's just this
[54:05] but you know what they don't want to say
[54:06] hey you know what god has been
[54:08] faithful and spoken to somebody and you
[54:10] know then they you know that's
[54:12] you know they just want to duck their
[54:13] head and you know no i don't i don't
[54:14] look i don't talk about them
[54:19] but let me tell you something you know
[54:21] what this is this is a late hour and
[54:22] you've got to have confidence
[54:24] in what god has said and you know the
[54:26] the prophet never contradicted what this
[54:28] bible had to say
[54:31] this this book right here is what's
[54:33] going to get you through and you know
[54:34] what
[54:35] brother branham didn't come up with his
[54:36] own ideas brother madam didn't just come
[54:38] up with something
[54:39] out of some fairy tale or whatever but
[54:41] you know what he the angel of the lord
[54:42] began to speak to him and the lord
[54:44] showed him what was in this book right
[54:45] here
[54:46] and he began to open it up the problem
[54:48] is is you and i've got to get in the
[54:49] same
[54:50] spirit we've got to get into the same
[54:52] anointing that
[54:53] that he was under that he can come and
[54:55] speak to us so we can receive exactly
[54:57] what he spoke
[54:59] because many people they said well i you
[55:01] know brother battle was confused here
[55:02] and he was wrong here and he got this
[55:03] all mixed up whatever
[55:04] the problem is is they're not under the
[55:07] same anointing
[55:08] they're not because if you're born again
[55:10] if you receive the new birth then
[55:12] the the anointing that you have the the
[55:14] life that's inside of you that came on
[55:16] the day of
[55:17] pentecost that takes up residence inside
[55:19] of you
[55:22] then you know then you know what i can
[55:24] have confidence in that
[55:26] right you know i can have
[55:29] you know because if it's the same life
[55:31] it's the same life that lived in jesus
[55:35] and if he takes up residence in me then
[55:37] you know what i don't put faith
[55:38] in flesh i'm not putting faith
[55:41] in this flesh i'm not putting faith in
[55:43] flesh i have a fivefold ministry a man
[55:46] why because god resides there and
[55:48] there's a gift been placed in there an
[55:50] eternal predestinated gift that's been
[55:52] placed in there for god to speak to us
[55:54] and you know then i can trust that god
[55:57] spoke because you know what if they had
[55:58] an
[55:59] eternal predestinated gift of a man that
[56:02] came that was born
[56:03] in 1906 or 1909 in kentucky
[56:07] and everybody talks about well you know
[56:09] we've had god in our day that stood in
[56:11] flesh
[56:13] they came and was born in the log cabin
[56:15] in 1909
[56:17] little man then he came and he had very
[56:20] little education he come out of the
[56:22] backwoods
[56:22] and all these things and we look at his
[56:25] life and everybody talks about the
[56:26] things but you know god had us
[56:28] had a supernatural gift in this man's
[56:30] life and he began to speak
[56:32] and he began to confound all of the
[56:34] intellectuals of the day
[56:36] and he began to take the things that
[56:37] came out of the scripture
[56:39] that was preached so many years that
[56:42] people's been preaching and looking at
[56:43] and he began to bring these things out
[56:45] and he went right back to the scripture
[56:47] went right back to the old testament
[56:49] and he began to bring those things right
[56:50] out of the old testament and just like
[56:52] paul
[56:53] when paul was there and went back on the
[56:55] back side of the desert was back there
[56:56] and he
[56:57] studied all of those years he began to
[56:59] study the old testament but when the
[57:01] holy ghost came
[57:02] then he began to read the book a brand
[57:04] new book
[57:05] and he began to see those things that
[57:07] were written in the old testament
[57:08] and he began to bring them through and
[57:10] he began to show that jesus christ
[57:12] was all through the old testament and he
[57:14] began to show
[57:15] jesus christ in our day well then when
[57:17] brother branham came he went right back
[57:18] to the old testament
[57:20] he picked up the old testament showed
[57:22] paul
[57:23] exactly what paul preached was exactly
[57:25] what was in the old testament
[57:26] so when he went beyond the curtain of
[57:28] time and he came back he said i preached
[57:30] exactly what paul preached
[57:31] why because he started in the same place
[57:34] that paul did
[57:35] and he just came all the way through and
[57:37] when he came in our day and began to
[57:38] preach
[57:39] exactly what paul preached why because
[57:41] he began to open up the word
[57:44] because it was the same foundation that
[57:46] was in the beginning
[57:48] and he began to build on that
[57:54] so if it's if it's the same if it's the
[57:56] same one
[57:57] again it's the same one today
[58:04] well i can have confidence in there
[58:10] but see the problem is is people people
[58:12] don't don't receive the new birth
[58:15] they don't they don't get to the place
[58:16] where they they can have confidence in
[58:18] god because you know
[58:19] if you have the same spirit that he had
[58:24] then you he said he will lead you and
[58:26] guide you into all truth
[58:32] so we can have confidence in what god
[58:33] said
[58:35] all the way through the bible from
[58:36] genesis to revelation
[58:40] but the problem is is we've got to dig
[58:41] into that we've got we've got to search
[58:44] and and lay before god until he gives it
[58:47] to us
[58:50] many people you know they're just
[58:52] they're just hunting quotes
[58:56] but the problem is it's just like
[59:00] i was thinking the other day
[59:04] know you see people they get so tied up
[59:06] and and all these things and
[59:08] you know they've read all these things
[59:09] oh i've read that oh i've read that i've
[59:11] read that
[59:13] but you know i was thinking about years
[59:15] ago i i read the message the masterpiece
[59:18] and it's been i don't know 25 26 i don't
[59:22] know exactly how many years it's been a
[59:23] long time
[59:24] but i just i just and it's the first
[59:27] time i can remember hear
[59:28] this that's happening to me i i just
[59:31] finished reading the message the
[59:32] masterpiece
[59:33] and i was watching a video somebody had
[59:36] had loaned me and it was brother
[59:37] harold hildebrand preaching and he was
[59:39] actually preaching the message the
[59:40] masterpiece
[59:42] and he began to preach and he began to
[59:43] open things and say things and i was
[59:45] like
[59:47] i don't remember reading that i don't
[59:49] remember and it was so amazing because i
[59:51] went got the book while i was watching
[59:52] the video i stopped and it was like
[59:54] oh yeah and i began to read and all of a
[59:57] sudden all these things that i had read
[59:59] you know all of a sudden i'd missed
[1:00:00] these things and things all of a sudden
[1:00:02] then all of a sudden
[1:00:02] it become clear there were things that
[1:00:04] began to open up it's like well i didn't
[1:00:06] i mean you read it but it didn't become
[1:00:07] a reality it didn't
[1:00:09] all of a sudden it was like wow that
[1:00:10] that stands out but because you begin to
[1:00:12] see things but it takes the holy ghost
[1:00:14] to do that
[1:00:17] and if he was like oh no i'm just going
[1:00:18] to get it all on my own
[1:00:24] you know but i can tell by my own
[1:00:27] experience how god has blessed me
[1:00:29] through the fivefold ministry so
[1:00:34] amen but god wants us
[1:00:41] god has called us to a place god wants
[1:00:44] us to get into the word but you know god
[1:00:46] has given us men
[1:00:48] to lead us and i thank god
[1:00:51] because god has given me and you know
[1:00:54] everybody has to find their own place
[1:00:56] you've got to find who because
[1:00:57] brother brown said god give you a pastor
[1:01:01] that'll lead you and guide you you've
[1:01:02] got to find a place that's right for you
[1:01:04] you've got to find your place
[1:01:08] so you know i i i found my place i
[1:01:12] ain't worried about nobody else y'all
[1:01:13] got y'all got to find your own place you
[1:01:15] know
[1:01:18] i'm i'm i'm here and i'm brother dale's
[1:01:20] problem so
[1:01:21] amen so amen
[1:01:25] praise the lord
[1:01:28] well you know brother dale said one time
[1:01:30] years ago he said you know you know they
[1:01:32] uh
[1:01:32] you know if he's in the army he said
[1:01:34] they always give the
[1:01:35] really toughest sergeant he'd always
[1:01:37] give them the ones that were the
[1:01:39] toughest to deal with
[1:01:40] right it's always the tough nuts and all
[1:01:43] the problem
[1:01:44] they give them the hardest well
[1:01:48] praise the lord he got it
[1:01:52] that's all right we're going to make it
[1:01:54] that's right
[1:01:57] lord knew i needed more rapture and
[1:01:59] faith than the rest of you so god put me
[1:02:01] in the right place to get more rapture
[1:02:02] in faith so
[1:02:04] but god's called us to this place god
[1:02:07] wants us to get into the word
[1:02:08] god wants us to be the word god wants us
[1:02:11] to find our place
[1:02:13] and god wants wants to reveal himself to
[1:02:15] us
[1:02:16] but the thing is is you've got to you've
[1:02:18] got to have that desire you've got to
[1:02:19] have that place
[1:02:20] you've got to get in there and and and
[1:02:23] feed on the word
[1:02:24] that th that the word that you can
[1:02:26] become the word
[1:02:27] and as he said you know you've got to go
[1:02:29] out there and you've got to get that
[1:02:30] manna but god's given us the manner but
[1:02:32] are you going to eat the man
[1:02:33] are you going are you going to eat the
[1:02:35] book
[1:02:38] because god has called us on a path
[1:02:41] god called us on our journey to a
[1:02:43] certain place that god wants us to be
[1:02:47] you know as we were talking last time
[1:02:50] you know when when we're talking about
[1:02:52] elijah and
[1:02:54] you know the widow woman and you know
[1:02:56] how how the condition that the widow
[1:02:58] woman had gotten into
[1:02:59] and you know here was elijah sitting by
[1:03:02] the brook
[1:03:03] and the ravens were feeding him and he
[1:03:05] was drinking from the from the
[1:03:07] uh brook cherith as he sat there and you
[1:03:09] know he was enjoying himself and having
[1:03:11] a
[1:03:11] quiet time and she was down there
[1:03:13] struggling in the town
[1:03:14] trying to figure out how she's going to
[1:03:16] feed her and her son and they would you
[1:03:17] know just become to
[1:03:18] get so worried and all these problems
[1:03:20] but you know she didn't realize that god
[1:03:22] had
[1:03:22] had a plan god had already provided for
[1:03:26] her but you know what she didn't realize
[1:03:27] that the
[1:03:28] the way that had been provided she just
[1:03:30] didn't see it
[1:03:32] and then and god tells elijah when he's
[1:03:34] sitting out there he said i've prepared
[1:03:36] a widow woman to sustain you
[1:03:40] that she couldn't even sustain herself
[1:03:42] she was all con
[1:03:44] worried and confused and all these
[1:03:45] things but you know god god had his
[1:03:47] prophet setting up there
[1:03:49] and just relaxing and and going through
[1:03:51] until the brook dried up
[1:03:52] and then god sent him down there to her
[1:03:54] and he began to speak the word to him
[1:03:56] and when he began to speak the word to
[1:03:58] her here she was in the midst of a
[1:04:00] famine and all these things that was
[1:04:01] going on
[1:04:02] and he said give me a drink
[1:04:07] and you know she was and she was willing
[1:04:10] to give him a drink of water and a
[1:04:11] famine
[1:04:14] and she'd be and she was willing and
[1:04:15] then he said well make me a cake
[1:04:20] and that stopped her in her tracks
[1:04:23] but you know he told her said you know
[1:04:25] she because she said listen
[1:04:26] we're going to die we're going we're
[1:04:28] going to starve to death i'm going to
[1:04:29] make this a little bit no
[1:04:30] no listen i want you to listen make me a
[1:04:33] little cake first
[1:04:36] and if you follow what i if you believe
[1:04:37] what i have to say to you
[1:04:40] says you'll never want glory right
[1:04:44] the the meal will never run out the crew
[1:04:47] will never go dry
[1:04:48] amen and you know she went out there and
[1:04:50] she made that little bit for him and you
[1:04:52] know what
[1:04:52] she was able to sustain them
[1:04:56] in that time just by following the
[1:04:58] simple
[1:04:59] instructions that that elijah had that
[1:05:02] god had already provided
[1:05:03] and brothers and sister god has already
[1:05:05] provided for you and me
[1:05:07] he's already provided everything that
[1:05:08] you have need of in this earthly journey
[1:05:10] but the problem is we don't want to let
[1:05:13] go
[1:05:14] we want to try to figure out things on
[1:05:15] our own or we want to have some kind of
[1:05:17] control on our own
[1:05:19] and not realizing that you know what
[1:05:21] none of it belongs to us
[1:05:25] you know i i think i think of the the
[1:05:27] the prodigal son
[1:05:29] you know the prodigal son when he went
[1:05:31] out there and you know and
[1:05:32] and he had he must had a pretty good
[1:05:35] living
[1:05:37] you know with everything that he had and
[1:05:39] you know and he
[1:05:40] decided hey you know what i'm grown i
[1:05:42] got the answers
[1:05:44] i'm gonna do my own thing and he's like
[1:05:47] then he told his dad he said give me my
[1:05:48] portion i want mine
[1:05:50] give me mine i got this
[1:05:54] i'm ready to go make my own living ready
[1:05:56] to go do my own thing you know
[1:06:00] and you know no no doubt it broke
[1:06:03] the father's heart to do that but that's
[1:06:06] what he wanted
[1:06:08] you know the father knowing what was
[1:06:09] going to take place because if you if
[1:06:11] you're not if you're not equipped
[1:06:13] to to handle the situation you're going
[1:06:15] to miserably fail
[1:06:19] and so you know he took on he took on
[1:06:21] his living and then he went out and he
[1:06:22] said you know he he
[1:06:23] lived you know riotous living he spent
[1:06:26] all that he had
[1:06:27] why because he had no plan he hadn't had
[1:06:30] no had no
[1:06:31] uh foundation he had not had no purpose
[1:06:32] in what he was trying to do
[1:06:36] he just he's just like today in the in
[1:06:38] the world that we live in in this
[1:06:39] generation it's just hey we're gonna do
[1:06:41] whatever feels good
[1:06:44] we're just gonna we're just gonna we're
[1:06:45] just gonna meet our our needs whatever
[1:06:47] whatever satisfies whatever tickles my
[1:06:49] funny bone or whatever you know that's
[1:06:50] all we're gonna do
[1:06:51] oh yeah and i have no and i have no plan
[1:06:53] but the next thing you know
[1:06:54] it sees the worst place that a jewish
[1:06:57] boy could be is down by a pig pen
[1:06:59] right down there with a bunch of hogs
[1:07:01] and trying to feed them
[1:07:03] and said that he would find they eat
[1:07:05] from the husk
[1:07:06] that would that the uh pigs were given
[1:07:10] he said but no man would give to him
[1:07:14] here he was you know come from all this
[1:07:16] had a great father
[1:07:17] had a great background you know had a
[1:07:19] good home and everything no
[1:07:20] no i got to do my own thing and then he
[1:07:22] ends up in a mess
[1:07:25] and then he's down there starving and
[1:07:26] trying to figure out how the world he's
[1:07:27] going to do and he said you know i got
[1:07:29] to go back home
[1:07:30] i got to go back to my you know he said
[1:07:32] my father's servants are at home and
[1:07:33] they got
[1:07:34] bread and and some despair and he said
[1:07:37] you know they're not going hungry but
[1:07:38] i'm down here dying
[1:07:40] i'm the son of this man and here i am
[1:07:42] dying
[1:07:43] right and his servants are better off
[1:07:45] than i am
[1:07:47] and he said you know he came to himself
[1:07:49] and realized the condition that he was
[1:07:50] in
[1:07:51] and he's like well i'm gonna go back to
[1:07:53] my father
[1:07:56] and brothers and sisters we look at the
[1:07:57] day that we live in and people wonder
[1:07:59] why things are the condition that people
[1:08:01] are in
[1:08:02] and you know i'm on metal a little bit
[1:08:03] if y'all don't mind and i thank you very
[1:08:05] much
[1:08:06] but uh you know we live we live in the
[1:08:08] condition and people wonder why
[1:08:10] that they live in that they're in the
[1:08:12] condition that they're in
[1:08:13] and you know you know i just want to
[1:08:17] meddle for a little bit but you know
[1:08:19] people wonder why they
[1:08:20] they can't get ahead people people work
[1:08:25] and you know and you know as wade was
[1:08:27] talking about the other day being
[1:08:28] being the boss and you know trying to
[1:08:30] have employees and take care of things
[1:08:31] well you know what
[1:08:32] if you gotta if you've got an employee
[1:08:34] that don't do what they're supposed to
[1:08:36] do
[1:08:36] you know what they soon find themselves
[1:08:38] on the street
[1:08:41] you're not going to have them around
[1:08:43] because you don't need them
[1:08:46] and you know what brothers and sisters
[1:08:48] the bible tells us
[1:08:49] that we are stewards
[1:08:53] what is a steward
[1:08:56] a steward is somebody that has something
[1:08:59] that takes care of something
[1:09:00] they don't own it they take care of it
[1:09:03] they manage it
[1:09:08] the bible tells us the blessing of the
[1:09:10] lord it maketh rich
[1:09:12] it has it has no adds no sorrow to it
[1:09:17] but you know we got people out there
[1:09:19] that that you know they wonder why they
[1:09:20] can't get ahead in life why because they
[1:09:22] don't follow god's plan
[1:09:28] when you know when when god has blessed
[1:09:30] us and you know
[1:09:32] i was listening to somebody the other
[1:09:33] day and they were talking about you know
[1:09:34] people's like man i wish i had a million
[1:09:36] dollars you know what brother wayne i
[1:09:37] wish i had a million dollars i wish i
[1:09:39] had a million dollars
[1:09:40] man what i could do if i had a million
[1:09:42] dollars and you know what people don't
[1:09:44] realize they've already had a million
[1:09:45] dollars
[1:09:46] if you sit down and take with the money
[1:09:47] that you've made over the last 20 years
[1:09:49] you've already had a million dollars
[1:09:51] some people have actually had more than
[1:09:52] a million dollars over the last 20 years
[1:09:54] and they ain't got two nickels to run
[1:09:56] together
[1:09:56] right and they wonder why they ain't got
[1:09:59] anything
[1:10:01] well you know but one of the problems
[1:10:03] that people have is they rob
[1:10:04] god
[1:10:08] you know what you don't pay tithes then
[1:10:10] guess what you know you can't have any
[1:10:12] blessings
[1:10:13] he said prove me and see he said oh and
[1:10:17] i'll tell you something else
[1:10:19] i got i got that and this is what the
[1:10:21] bible says so you have to you have to
[1:10:23] deal with that
[1:10:23] the bible says to bring your ties into
[1:10:25] the storehouse
[1:10:26] it never says send them
[1:10:32] it says to bring your tithes into the
[1:10:34] storehouse not send them
[1:10:40] that's what the bible says the bible
[1:10:43] says to bring your tithes into the
[1:10:45] storehouse
[1:10:46] brain not sinned
[1:10:50] but you know there's a lot of churches
[1:10:52] you know they like to have their website
[1:10:53] and everybody just
[1:10:54] you just swipe your debit card online
[1:10:57] you can send it
[1:11:01] i might step on some toes i might get
[1:11:03] hurt after that but
[1:11:05] it's still the truth
[1:11:09] i said what the bible says i don't know
[1:11:12] y'all handle that however you want to
[1:11:15] but people don't pay their tithes people
[1:11:17] don't people don't believe in giving to
[1:11:18] god
[1:11:18] and the problem is is they get their
[1:11:20] eyes on man
[1:11:24] well i'm not i'm not going to give money
[1:11:26] to him
[1:11:29] you know what you know if you're giving
[1:11:31] money to if you if you've got your mind
[1:11:33] on the man it's like well i'm not going
[1:11:34] to give my money to brother dale then
[1:11:35] you know what
[1:11:35] you're not getting the blessings of god
[1:11:37] because you're not applying the word
[1:11:39] right because it's giving to god not to
[1:11:41] a man
[1:11:43] if you think well i'm going to give it
[1:11:44] to brother so-and-so or so brother
[1:11:46] so-and-so or whoever
[1:11:47] you give it to if you want to send it to
[1:11:48] jeffersonville or whoever they plan on
[1:11:50] sending their money to the problem is if
[1:11:52] you're not giving it to god it's
[1:11:54] wrong
[1:11:57] so we got to we've got to have our mind
[1:11:59] because you know the problem is is
[1:12:00] people are so bound by things that that
[1:12:02] are in their mind and not realizing that
[1:12:04] you know
[1:12:04] god is in control of all of it it's
[1:12:06] god's not yours
[1:12:12] people want to love some of money and
[1:12:14] not realize that you know
[1:12:15] you know how you know talk about brother
[1:12:18] wade here
[1:12:19] you know having a business well if wade
[1:12:21] had a business
[1:12:22] and you know you had and you know you
[1:12:24] had somebody that was working for you
[1:12:25] and they were managing three people
[1:12:27] and they couldn't manage three people
[1:12:28] and they couldn't figure out how to get
[1:12:29] everything done
[1:12:30] you wouldn't give them 12 people to
[1:12:32] manage would you no
[1:12:34] no yeah they'd be gone
[1:12:39] well some people you know lord give me a
[1:12:41] million dollars and i'll show you that
[1:12:43] it won't ruin me
[1:12:45] the god's gave you a half a million
[1:12:47] dollars over the last 15 years and it's
[1:12:49] ruined you right
[1:12:50] now and people and people wonder why
[1:12:54] and yeah you know and it's the same way
[1:12:56] in the gospel now
[1:12:58] you know you look at you look at the the
[1:12:59] scripture when it when it comes to money
[1:13:01] well you know what we're just going
[1:13:02] we're just going to live high
[1:13:04] and mighty and you know what and the
[1:13:05] problem is is it leads to a destruction
[1:13:08] but it's the same way with the gospel
[1:13:11] the problem is
[1:13:12] is people want to you know hey i just i
[1:13:14] just want to come and hear the pastor
[1:13:15] i'm just going to hear come you know
[1:13:17] what i'm not going to pray and i'm not
[1:13:18] going to read and i'm not going to do
[1:13:20] anything on my own
[1:13:21] i just want you to give it to me brother
[1:13:22] dale and brother wade brother bob
[1:13:24] brother elise i'm just going to come and
[1:13:25] i'm going to let y'all give it to me and
[1:13:26] i don't have to do any study i don't
[1:13:27] have to read
[1:13:28] i don't do anything i'm just going to
[1:13:30] come and i'm going to soak it up
[1:13:32] right yep come on well let me tell you
[1:13:34] brothers and sisters you know what
[1:13:36] if it would be so simple if we could
[1:13:38] just learn by osmosis
[1:13:41] we could just we just you know i would
[1:13:42] just make a bed of the message books
[1:13:44] i just make a pill all the message books
[1:13:46] and i could just sleep i just wrap
[1:13:48] myself in the message
[1:13:53] yeah yeah put a message back on each ear
[1:13:55] and just
[1:14:01] but i mean that's what you know it's
[1:14:02] just so simple because i would just have
[1:14:03] to lay down this one yeah
[1:14:09] but you know it's a battle it's a
[1:14:10] struggle
[1:14:12] you know you know if it was just so easy
[1:14:14] well you know what if it was just so
[1:14:16] easy you know
[1:14:16] brother wade we could just take the
[1:14:17] bible we just tear pages out of it and
[1:14:19] just say we're going to eat the book
[1:14:22] if it was that simple
[1:14:25] but it's not but god gave us away
[1:14:30] how do you how do you get closer to god
[1:14:31] he said to pray
[1:14:33] and read your bible we need to be
[1:14:35] listening to the word if we get into the
[1:14:37] word then you know what the word gets
[1:14:38] into us
[1:14:39] god can have communication with us but
[1:14:41] the problem is is if we don't ever do
[1:14:43] that
[1:14:43] how do we expect to grow how do we ever
[1:14:46] expect to get anywhere with god
[1:14:48] [Applause]
[1:14:52] god god has blessed us but sometimes we
[1:14:54] don't we we get our soul
[1:14:56] mind so wrapped up and we don't even
[1:14:57] realize what god's blessed us with
[1:15:04] you know you know you you
[1:15:07] listen to people come on
[1:15:11] we listen to people like dave ramsey and
[1:15:12] you know and
[1:15:14] you know i don't i you know i i listen
[1:15:16] to people you know i think i got it bad
[1:15:17] sometimes you realize you know what i
[1:15:19] ain't got nothing
[1:15:20] no it's it's like man the conditions
[1:15:23] people
[1:15:24] are in amen
[1:15:28] but you know god has given us away
[1:15:33] and it's and it's so simple
[1:15:37] and it's it and it's so simple and you
[1:15:39] know what people struggle with it
[1:15:43] and and it's so simple because you know
[1:15:45] what brother like
[1:15:47] if somebody was dying if you had
[1:15:50] somebody that was dying and you told
[1:15:52] them say listen

[1:16:08] going to have to do
[1:16:09] and this is your plan and we'll give you
[1:16:12] the prescription

[1:16:44] even if the insurance don't pay if it's
[1:16:46] gonna get me well i'm going to take it
[1:16:50] and there's people that sell their
[1:16:51] houses and their cars and everything
[1:16:53] else to get what they need
[1:16:55] to make it why because life is precious
[1:16:59] to them
[1:17:00] and you know what there's nothing going
[1:17:01] to stop them from taking what god
[1:17:03] you know what the doctor tells them but
[1:17:05] you know the problem is is when
[1:17:07] when god gives you a prescription let me
[1:17:10] tell you
[1:17:10] this world is not going to last
[1:17:15] we're you know we're we don't know how
[1:17:16] much longer we have but you know like
[1:17:18] brother brown i'm talking about
[1:17:19] uh california he's like all that lays
[1:17:22] under here is a honeycomb
[1:17:25] and he said he said the judgment of god
[1:17:27] is resting out there
[1:17:28] and he didn't know how much longer it
[1:17:30] would be he said it's like that
[1:17:31] scientist said he said it's not
[1:17:33] if it's going to happen he said it when
[1:17:35] it's going to happen and let me tell you
[1:17:37] some brother sisters there's a rapture
[1:17:38] coming one day and it's a true thing
[1:17:40] it's going to happen
[1:17:42] and you know what none of us are
[1:17:43] promised tomorrow young people you're
[1:17:45] not promised tonight
[1:17:48] you don't know when you're going to be
[1:17:50] and you think you can ride on mama and
[1:17:51] daddy's coattail or somebody else's
[1:17:53] cocktail listen
[1:17:54] you get to a certain age you're going to
[1:17:55] come to the age of accountability
[1:17:57] god's going to speak to your heart and
[1:17:58] you're going to have to give an answer
[1:17:59] to god
[1:18:00] i can't answer for you brother dale
[1:18:01] can't answer for your mom and daddy
[1:18:03] can't answer for you
[1:18:04] you'll have to give an answer for
[1:18:05] yourself and let me tell you something
[1:18:07] brother scissors
[1:18:08] to to be lacks in the hour that we live
[1:18:11] in and and you know because you know
[1:18:12] we can get wrapped up in so many things
[1:18:14] but you know we've got to be to the
[1:18:15] place where we stand up
[1:18:17] and we we get desperate on what's going
[1:18:20] on
[1:18:20] and how we're how we're conducting
[1:18:22] ourselves to be ready in this hour
[1:18:28] god has blessed us but god has called us
[1:18:30] to a holy calling
[1:18:31] god has called us to a place that we we
[1:18:33] fulfill the word of god that god has
[1:18:34] called us to
[1:18:36] but the thing i want to tell you some of
[1:18:37] the brothers and sisters tonight god has
[1:18:39] said he
[1:18:40] he said he said taste and see that the
[1:18:42] lord is good he wants you to try him he
[1:18:44] wants you to prove him why because he's
[1:18:46] there
[1:18:47] and he wants to pray he wants to show
[1:18:48] you what he's got
[1:18:50] but the thing is is are you going to go
[1:18:52] in there and accept it you're going to
[1:18:53] take him at his word
[1:18:54] are you going to do what god wants you
[1:18:56] to do and and fight the battle
[1:18:58] and whatever it takes you do what god
[1:19:00] wants you to do and you me
[1:19:01] because god will give you exactly what
[1:19:04] you have need of
[1:19:06] he makes the condition
[1:19:10] as brother luis was preaching some time
[1:19:12] back you know
[1:19:13] when peter was there he said lord if
[1:19:15] that's you he said then bid me to come
[1:19:20] well you know what he he you know he
[1:19:22] didn't he didn't say well
[1:19:24] listen peter i want you to do this
[1:19:28] you may you may you may have prom though
[1:19:31] no he didn't he didn't give him nothing
[1:19:32] else but he told him to come
[1:19:35] that's all he told him he said lord in
[1:19:37] fact you bid me to come well he didn't
[1:19:38] give him no condition he said come
[1:19:43] and you know it's so simple it's the
[1:19:44] same way god does he tell you
[1:19:46] if you're going to take the lord i need
[1:19:48] healing in my body and you know i'm so
[1:19:49] tired of being sick and tired
[1:19:52] and whatever i whatever i'm i'm facing
[1:19:54] and you know i've got these aches and
[1:19:56] these pains and all these other things
[1:19:57] well you know what
[1:19:58] god is still the healer and the thing is
[1:20:01] that you've got to
[1:20:02] you've got to drive your stake down and
[1:20:04] make your claim and make your testimony
[1:20:06] sure
[1:20:07] and and so you know whatever god has
[1:20:09] done that but you know what you've got
[1:20:10] to take him at his word
[1:20:14] then you stand up and you confess what
[1:20:15] god said and you know every time the
[1:20:17] devil comes at you
[1:20:18] i ain't got time to listen to that get
[1:20:19] behind me saying i got time listen to
[1:20:21] that
[1:20:22] amen i'm i'm healed
[1:20:25] that's the reason i like singing that
[1:20:27] song i am healed
[1:20:28] i am whole from the top of my head to
[1:20:31] the souls to the tip of my toes
[1:20:34] he said isaiah 53 5 says we are and if
[1:20:37] we are then i am
[1:20:39] why because he said it first peter 2 24
[1:20:43] says we were
[1:20:44] and if we were then i am why because he
[1:20:46] said it
[1:20:48] then all i got to do is believe that
[1:20:52] you know that whatever i have need of
[1:20:54] then god will meet my needs but you know
[1:20:56] the thing is is i've got to claim what
[1:20:57] god has done and say lord what do i need
[1:20:59] to do
[1:21:02] because god will lead you along the way
[1:21:04] and you know so many times people get to
[1:21:05] a certain place and they don't know
[1:21:06] where else to go
[1:21:08] yeah it's like it's like they're between
[1:21:10] a rock and a hard place well the good
[1:21:12] thing is is god's error in the rock and
[1:21:13] the hard place because that's where god
[1:21:15] wants you to be because many times god
[1:21:17] can get your attention now
[1:21:19] you you get to the place that god wants
[1:21:21] you to be it's like
[1:21:22] we make it well lord i made a mistake
[1:21:24] lord i made a mess of this thing well
[1:21:26] you know what
[1:21:26] that ain't the time to give up
[1:21:30] you know now's the time just like just
[1:21:32] like the prodigal son when you're
[1:21:33] sitting down there and
[1:21:34] and down there with the pig pen guess
[1:21:36] what the lord's speaking to you now it's
[1:21:37] time to wake up
[1:21:39] come to yourselves you go turn around
[1:21:42] you're just like well
[1:21:43] you know everything's a mess i don't
[1:21:44] know what to go well you know what it
[1:21:45] takes a journey of one step
[1:21:47] when we come to the place that we
[1:21:48] realize then we go from there we don't
[1:21:50] spend all our time worried about what
[1:21:52] took place in the past
[1:21:53] or trying to figure these things out we
[1:21:55] need to move forward with god
[1:21:57] god's calling us to a place we need to
[1:21:59] move on with god
[1:22:04] amen
[1:22:09] the scripture tells us i love that
[1:22:11] scripture
[1:22:14] said this man this poor man cried and
[1:22:17] the lord
[1:22:18] heard him and saved him from all of his
[1:22:20] troubles
[1:22:21] i mean you know when you cry out to god
[1:22:23] when you have a need and you need
[1:22:25] something
[1:22:25] then you know where to go to to get your
[1:22:27] answer god can give you the answer
[1:22:29] exactly what you have need of
[1:22:31] god is here to meet your need but do you
[1:22:32] are you actually going for it because
[1:22:34] the manna is here
[1:22:36] god the manna has fallen god has given
[1:22:38] everything that you have need of
[1:22:40] is here in the word but the thing is is
[1:22:42] do you take the prescription
[1:22:43] have you raised up and accepted what god
[1:22:45] has given you
[1:22:46] right amen let's let's stand because you
[1:22:50] know

[1:25:32] wednesdays and and speak through
[1:25:33] our brothers and you know these and

[1:25:48] and and you know not realizing god has
[1:25:50] come to meet you
[1:25:54] you know no wonder when you know when we
[1:25:56] sing the song we are standing on holy
[1:25:58] ground
[1:26:00] do we actually believe that or is that
[1:26:02] just words
[1:26:05] you know we are standing in his presence
[1:26:10] if you believe that he's here tonight
[1:26:12] then you're in his presence
[1:26:15] and he is here to meet your need he come
[1:26:17] to meet you
[1:26:19] because he said wherever two or three
[1:26:21] are gathered in my name i'm there in the
[1:26:23] midst
[1:26:25] so if you've got a need if you've got a
[1:26:27] question if you've got a concern
[1:26:28] whatever it is
[1:26:29] he's here but you know what the thing is
[1:26:31] it breaks the father's heart when you
[1:26:33] leave out that door and you don't get
[1:26:35] your need met
[1:26:36] but you know what god is here to meet
[1:26:38] your need but the problem is
[1:26:40] have you come to receive from him
[1:26:44] you know when the when the woman with
[1:26:46] the issue of blood was she came
[1:26:48] she you know she didn't even have a word
[1:26:49] to stand on
[1:26:51] there's no place in the scripture says
[1:26:52] if you touch the savior's
[1:26:54] garment you get healed but you know what
[1:26:57] she believed inside of herself
[1:27:01] that you know what she no now she had
[1:27:03] heard and seen the things
[1:27:04] that jesus had done she didn't even have
[1:27:06] to have him touch her
[1:27:09] she didn't even have to touch him all
[1:27:11] she had to do was touch the hem of his
[1:27:13] garment
[1:27:15] when she got to the place that she was
[1:27:17] so desperate when she desired so much
[1:27:20] that everything else was gone and the
[1:27:22] only thing that she had between life and
[1:27:23] death was him
[1:27:26] she got to the place she said if i can
[1:27:27] but touch the hem of his garments
[1:27:32] brothers and sisters a child of god
[1:27:35] doesn't have to go that far
[1:27:38] his desire is for you and for you to
