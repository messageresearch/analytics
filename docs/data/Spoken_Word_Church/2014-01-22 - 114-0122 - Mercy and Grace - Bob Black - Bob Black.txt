talk about tonight it's a it's a cold night but let's just warm ourselves around not a painted fire but a real gospel fire tonight and just gather around the word let's bow our heads before we read Lord Jesus we thank you God for your grace to us to serve another day and Lord together around your word on this cold winter night Lord and I pray God that you'll just give us something Lord as we come expecting Lord to receive from you Lord Jesus Lord maybe with broken hearts and needy Lord needy people Lord I believe you made us a needy people Lord to need from you Lord to come to you to be filled Lord Jesus Lord we come gathering around the carcass Lord tonight Lord Jesus where you promis that if that that if we'd come around that carcass Lord that you'd Feed Us Lord and give us your word Lord Jesus Lord we're trusting and expecting Lord Jesus they're expecting and I'm expecting that you come deliver Lord Jesus where I'm lacking Lord and I pray God that you will put your words in my mouth and close my mouth to my own opinions and my own ideas and thoughts Lord Jesus that you might come upon the scene and have preeminence this night Lord we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ 2 John verse one the Elder unto the elect lady and her children now you know I I've heard so many people you know talk about how they scared and stuff to talk to the elect lady and I was reading the other night that that brother randam said that he counted a privilege to talk to the elect lady and uh and and her children and uh you know I I really I I count it just a real privilege and uh my wife uh she walked I just tell this real she walked by the uh uh the room while I was studying and you know she's not to make boast of myself but I I I try to study a lot because the Bible says redeem the time right and as we come come together I don't want to uh I don't want to waste the time you I know many of you have come from far and and wide and and traveled and and I uh I want to make it worth your while and I pray you that it will be and you know my wife said I'm glad I don't have to preach cuz you know you get in there and and uh and uh you want to do what's right the Elder unto the elect lady and her children whom I love and the truth and not I only but also all they that have known the truth cuz if You' known the truth you can't help but love one another you can't help but love God's children for the truth sake which dwelleth in us and shall be with us forever Grace be with you now this is the this is the my little topic this is a greeting that that a lot of the New Testament Saints used Paul and Peter and they they would when they would greet each other they would greet each other in this little expression Grace be with you mercy and peace from God the father and from the Lord Jesus Christ the son of the father in Truth and Love and now I want to turn over to Mark 16 and just kind of keep that in your in your uh in your pocket mark 16:15 my pages are a little bit stuck here and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature you may be seated the Lord out his Blessing to the reading of the word cuz every time you open up the word you're going to be blessed uh even if you don't understand it you know it just keeps adding and adding and and a little bit here and a little bit there and you know I I was coming this was the first time that I ever preached at night uh usually you know it's it's always been in the morning and I I got to think you know little things like that you start thinking about different things and I started thinking on the it shall be light about the evening time and as the sun goes down you know we've all uh many of us today have have at work and you've been out there in the in the world and it looks real dark and Bleak and uh the as as the the world progresses things get darker and darker remember that uh the when the when the Lord painted on the back of the Tabernacle the the seven stages and it just got darker and darker until it looks like there's almost no light left but we've got a promise that it shall be light about the evening time when it when it looks the darkest then then as brother BR said the sun peeps out the rising of the sun it peeps out and and I believe he's manifesting himself today in the flesh of his children that El that elect lady his his manifest you know I was looking up at uh you can look up the last few nights the the moon has been real bright and I got I got to thinking about the moon landing and uh maybe my mind goes in strange places but I was thinking about how that uh when the when they when they first landed on the moon uh they the the first words they said uh Neil Armstrong had he he had meditated and he said I'm going to come up with something just that so memorable and he' me meditated and and thought about what he was going to say uh one small step for a man one giant leap for mankind and he and he messed it up he said one small step for man one giant leap for mankind and he said when he when he took that first step he he was thinking should I should I keep should I keep going cuz he said one small except for man and he he thought should I should I stop and correct it cuz the whole world was listening to what he had to say and you know man is is uh can make mistakes but in this in this Bible the word has been put together so perfectly that there's not one jot or one tit out of place and everything must be fulfilled and I can put all of my rest and all of my hopes and dreams everything that I have all of my hopes are bottled up are are are put on on this I've hung my soul on what on the gospel and and you can hang your your soul on God's word but you can't hang your soul on you know as much as I premeditate as much as I think that I might make a mistake but God's word will never fail and it it so blessed me I was uh I heard this this Minister testifying about it it just really blessed me about how he um and now I'm I'm I'm so far off my notes but uh he he was talking about um that that he faced a a trial and I won't say his name but because it doesn't really matter but he when he was younger he faced a real trial that he went to this one church and they prophesied that he was going to marry this girl and and then he went to another church and he prophesied that he was going to marry this this other the same girl that not knowing anything about the prophecy and it turned out that that that girl was he was he wanted to be a minister and he felt called but that girl was in sin and you know what the Bible says you know we've been through that so now now you come to a Crossroads what are you going to do are you going to take what what the the prophecy that's going forth that appears to be from the Lord two people that don't in two different churches that don't know each other don't know what's going on and he was presented with a Crossroads in his life which way to take the God's word or what appeared to be the right thing to do a sensation a prophecy that that seemed right the way that there is a way that seem is right but uh uh you know there's it's it's fraught with danger and error and uh just a paraphrase now now I I wanted I wanted to speak this morning because I I was talking to uh someone recently that had uh had not come to church in a long time and you know when people people begin to build up things in their mind about you know everybody hates me and things and and uh and and God's mercy has run out and so I wanted to take for a little a little topic this this tonight just a a small maybe just a real simple thing you know a lot of times you you start studying on something that seems simple and it becomes greater and greater until uh you know it just adds on and adds on right but um I want to I want to take for the little topic tonight Grace be with you mercy and peace from God the father and how does that come that we would have grace and mercy Grace and and and mercy how does that delivered and uh you know I I remember um I I was reading about this uh this old black preacher that in the um right about the time of World War I it's a real odd strange story and he uh the The Story Goes that that they they uh you know they were a lot of people in that Community were worried about uh people rising up and and doing you know worri about communism that communism was bad back you know they were the the fear of it was bad and uh so they they rode by his church and they heard this brother preaching he's preaching his heart out they put on the whole armor of God and you've got to fight for you every every ground that you stand on and and fight for what you believe in and and uh they heard that and they they they tried to they put trumped up charges on him that he was trying to start a little Mil militia and uh and and and fight all of the the people in that community and as odd as that and strange as that sounds they they actually wound up taking him and putting him on a stump and had a noose around his neck and they said uh one of one of them rose up and said before before we hang him let's give him a chance to talk now so you know he's up on that stunt with a noose around his neck and what what can he do to say to defend himself can he talk about how what a great person he is what uh what all the things that he had done in his life but instead of what of that he he lifted up his his you know he just he began to speak about something higher and something nobler than his own self and he began to talk about the cause that he had he believed that he was involved with since he he was called to do since he was a young child and and he began to talk about the work that God was doing in his life and the the things that they were doing how they were educating these little young children and all the things that were going on in that church and by the time that he was done they took the Noose off of his neck and they were wanting to pledge their money and their time to his cause because he hadn't lift he wasn't telling about his own self his own life but he was lifting up something higher and something nobler and I believe that's really the gospel the gospel message of mercy and and Grace is not something that that uh you I was thinking of uh sorry I'm jumping around a little bit but I I was thinking of reading uh when I read John Bun's Pilgrim's Progress he told about the the Walk of of Christian the the the little man was named Christian and as he started his journey Moses got on his back and began to beat him and and sometimes that seems how some I don't want to talk about ministers but sometimes it seems like that's how some ministers try to do is is beat you to the gospel beat you with a law beat you with you must do this but a real uh I believe a real God call Min will pull you toward the truth through three pulls will pull you toward the truth of the the real gospel message drawing you like brother brandham Drew people through three pools drawing you toward the truth and it pulls you to a want a desire to serve God a desire to serve him more and mercy pulls you Mercy leads to Grace which leads to peace Mercy is uh many times we confuse the two what what is mer what's the difference between mercy and Grace and they're they're I've heard it said that they're like sisters that they they almost you almost can't find one without the other that Mercy is the removal of what you deserve and Grace is giving a blessing and it's it's very very strange how uh how it's uh as as I as I was growing up how you know I would hear the gospel preached I don't believe that you can really preach the true gospel without Mercy but some so often it's it's Mercy is removed from the equation Mercy is taken out and how how give me some examples brother Bob now now brother Brown gave the the great example that we look at of well the days of Miracles are passed so you go to the doctor and the doctor says you got cancer well there's and there's nothing we can do and you go to your preacher and the preacher says well I'm sorry the days of Miracles are passed and he removes Mercy from the equation he takes Mercy out there's how where's the mercy at but there is Mercy and mercy David said the uh well all through the Old Testament if you run in in the table software right typ his mer mercy endureth forever you get uh just an endless number of quotes on and on but we you can't remove Mercy from the equation because Mercy is part of the Gospel now they say days of the days of Miracles are passed and I I maybe you know even if you hav't a preacher say that I think maybe sometimes we get in our our minds that the days of Miracles aren't passed but maybe God it's not God's will for me to be heal and I think that uh if if we can get ever get the Revelation that the days of Miracles for us are not passed you know they all all those people around the pool of Bethesda were waiting for something but if they could have called on to the Revelation that God is the same yesterday today and forever he's not just merciful in the New Testament but he was merciful throughout all the law all the old Testament and the New Testament he's always been a a a God that's ready to heal and ready to save and ready to meet our needs if we'll just come to him and now now I was looking at you know how how different people preach mercy and one of the reasons that one of the ways that Mercy is removed from the equation is is by putting a date on the requirement of your salvation and you know uh well I'll just you know brother Brown didn't like to say denominational names but we all know this this denomination had their initials are Jehovah's Witness and uh but they started a doctrine that that there was no mercy you could not go to heaven after 1881 and now it it's almost like that that leaped over into the message and and we started putting date criteria to to the you know you can't you can't get you can't go in the Rapture you can't get saved different things after 1963 or after 1977 but I believe that uh let's let's read this quote uh brother Joe pull up that I think it's number one questions and answers number three uh where somebody said in 1964 there we go brother random some say Mercy is over and no one can be saved now is this true I'm glad I got this one he said we watch and pray we watch the prayer lines and it seems some are still finding Mercy now that's the first question you got too is Mercy over and don't never think that see just keep right on doing everything you can until you're taken away see we notice in the prayer line some finds Mercy sure Mercy's doors are open see I think where you got this this thought might lay between see I don't have time to get each of the any of these scriptures the right place you see each one of these things the right place they in the prayer line you find Mercy certainly if I know Jesus was coming this afternoon I'd be doing just the thing I'm doing right now see just continuing right on Mercy is always open see and now where I think you get it is about the finishing of the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals being loose see the Seven Seals that's manifested what takes place as what has took place the seventh Church Age and and he goes on I won't read all that but but Mercy is still going on but why is it still going on now that's a question why is Mercy still available why can you still come because the is still here and the bride the the blood is the bumper blood is still covering the Earth because the bride is holding that at Bay and I believe that God uses the bride uses our hands and uses our eyes and uses our feet to deliver his mercy and his grace but you know a lot of times it's just not accepted it's not it's not received but let me go let me finish going through a few of these other ways that Mercy is is removed from the equation Mercy you people will take Mercy take your salvation away because of who your lineage is now I I'm not going to get into that too much but you know now you know they're attacking brother brandom's lineage I I I was shocked to see that the people are putting uh together uh genealogical trees or whatever try to poke a hole in his lineage but now aren't you so glad that you don't you can't put your faith in your own lineage I I if I went back in my own lineage I'd find oh who knows what and you know I was reading that even if you go back 10 Generations that that you'll find that somewhere along the line you and your wife both have the same grandfather because that's how that's how much it's stretched out you know that 10 Generations doesn't seem very far but if you there's like a 99% chance that both of you would have the same grandfather so you'll have you'll run into some problems some some things that might be worrisome if you search your lineage on back but if you're in the genes of God then that's what that's what my hope and my rest is that I'm I'm in him I'm I'm predestinated in him not in anything of my my own work my own flesh but um now now what what so what we do is is is you I remember uh that story back in numbers where uh you know Moses the children of Israel began to be bitten by fiery serpents fiery serpents bit them and and you know you could look at that in lots of different ways false doctrine that the the same serpent that bit uh Eve in the Garden of Eden that and and so forth and it begin to bite the children of Israel and so Mo God told Moses what to do he he ran out and sent Aaron among them to lift up a Brazen Serpent and uh the other day I was showing uh my kids we we rolled by a little hospital or whatever and that that Brazen serpent is still on the wall out there because of what that represents and they're advertising the gospel the Great of God and don't even realizing it a testimony that of God's grace and you know then I wonder and this is what I believe because just of human nature the stubbornness of people that as Aaron ran among the people with that Brazen serpent that there were people there that were in the stubborn in stubborn in their heart and refused to look upon that because uh you know even today is the gospel is Mercy is being preached and Grace is being preached from the h the pulpit people will look upon it stubbornly and say well I don't like that brother I don't like the way he presents it he presents it too harshly he presents it in a way that hurts my feelings and maybe Moses had done something that uh in their eyes was a little bit hurtful was a little bit they they thought he shouldn't do you know think about all the times that they they confronted him with with with things you shouldn't have done it this way but God was behind Moses God was behind the scenes and he Vindicated him he is when he cut when he pulled the veil off of his face his face Shone with the glory of God and God was in their midst and many I I I I believe when that braz serpent went among them that many of them there that they failed to realize that God was being merciful to them they failed to realize that God was issuing an invitation pulling them drawing them and all they had to do was look upon it and you remember that same scene played out when Jesus was on the cross that there was one on one side that said Lord remember me and there was another on the other side that laughed and mocked he all he had to do was just say Lord remember me he was right there in the presence of God right there in the presence of the almighty and he failed to recognize that mercy and grace are being offered Lord I I I wonder how many of us how many of us are maybe sitting and and and fail to recognize what God has done for us in this day that we come to church and come in an atmosphere but don't we fail to real iiz the mercy and the grace that God has given us that he's offering it just like he did that Brazen serpent all you have to do is look upon it and see what God has done amen and so so many times we'll remove Mercy from the equation but we'll give out Grace too freely now that's an interesting thing because you know and this might stumble I I I I told somebody this recently and it just I think blew their mind that Grace is not for everybody because first you have to accept mercy and uh you know I saw a copy of that little writing that uh that Abraham Lincoln said this prisoner is pardoned and he signed his name Abraham Lincoln and that little that pardon that Mercy that he had given was not accepted it was it was uh he he said I don't I don't believe it I don't believe that it's real I don't believe that it's true and so he didn't get grace and grace you know now think Grace wrapped up in Grace the grace of the gift of the Holy Ghost that after you receive his Mercy he gives you the gift of the Holy Ghost and then Grace just keeps on magnifying marriage and divorce the grace of marriage and divorce is not for those outside it's for a special elect group of people that have received God's mercy and the gift of the Holy Ghost is not for just any it was not for Cain because he did not receive it he did not even though God extended his hand and I I believe that that he said if you'll come and do like your brother even though he didn't you know have we say Abel had a revelation well God came down and spoke to Cain and said come on let's bring your offering bring it down and he extended his hand of mercy and Cain wouldn't accept it so he didn't get Grace Grace was not given to him Grace is only given to a special people that can accept God's mercy and you know think about the three pools of brother rand's Ministry how it's a mercy was shown in healing and mercy was shown by the gift of discernment to purify the purify the hearts of the Believers and as they begin to fail off fall off they fail to continue on to get Grace the opening of the word the uh spoken word the the uh and so forth and now now when God when a people begin to hunger for God's mercy for God's grace to be made manifest to them what does God do he send somebody as a represent representative of himself to administer that his Mercy to administered his grace glory to give it to give it out and you know I was I was thinking about when uh you know brother brand talked about uh before he began his ministry and he didn't he he didn't say exactly like I'll say it but they began to publish in the in the Pentecostal Publications and things that that uh send us pray for Elijah to come and the people began to look for that and pray and hunger and then Elijah came on the scene now if you pray and hunger in your heart for God to send you somebody to show you the word to open it to you then I believe that God will match your desire and he'll give you somebody and that's that's the truth now now so when the people are trying to line up with the word if you're trying to line up the word with the word then God will meet your desire by sending you a messenger amen now in Luke uh I'll just read this you don't have to pull it up or or turn to to it but now remember Zachariah John's father when he saw the angel he didn't believe him so his his uh he died a little bit so his tongue was sealed his tongue was and and then when John was born his tongue was loosed right and oh my was it loo and he began to Proclaim what kind of child this would be now the people they were hungering and thirsting for the word and I I want you to read uh just listen as I read the kind of child that God sent them to prepare the way for the one that that uh was going to come and and you know let's just listen verse Luke 1: 77-79 and he's talking about he's going to he's going to prepare the way of the Lord to give knowledge of Salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins now think think about now what mercy and Grace is Glory that somebody's going to stand before you behind a Pulpit to give you Mercy that's what I'm talking about to give knowledge of Salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins now as John I'm not quite done reading this but now John as he stood by the river uh Jordan baptizing and and preaching I believe so many failed to see what his purpose was that he was introducing them to Mercy he was showing them Grace preparing the way of the Lord to get them ready for what they had been waiting for for 4,000 years to give knowledge of Salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins through the tender mercy of our God whereby the Dayspring from on high hath visited us y'all know what day spring is Dayspring is the rising of the sun it is the rising of the sun that's right whereby the Dayspring from on high hath visited us to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of to guide our feet into the way of Peace So now John's come on the scene and Zachariah is prophesying that he's going through the tender mercy of our God to show to bring their to their knowledge of the Salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins and and that's what when when the people are hungering and thirsting for God then God puts somebody there to show them his mercy and so of when the instrument of Mercy is overlooked and misunderstood Noah stood outside of his ark preaching mercy and if they would have come in they would have receive Grace and he stood outside calling and and begging and pleading with people that God was going to judge the Earth and and uh if they would have just come into the ark they would have received the grace of being saved and carried over and think about Joseph who was who was you know he told him a dream that was true that he would be their deliverer he told his brothers that should have believed it but instead of believing it they mocked him and and scorned him and then they ended up you know things got really bad and they had to go on a a journey to um to to receive uh what God had in store for them but they they they didn't understand what God was doing they did they failed to recognize that God was working in their midst and we talked about Moses and David David now one of my favorite stories is how David you know when when Samuel came to to anoint David his he he he first stopped at his older brother eliab e l i a b if I pronounce that wrong y'all forgive me but now so he passed him by because he was he wasn't he wasn't the one that God had chosen but remember when David went to uh to battle Goliath and and there was a Liah waiting on him and he and David ran up with all the the provisions the food and the food and things and and uh a li was there to mock him and say what are what are you doing here and I forget the exact words he used but he failed to recognize that God's anointed was standing right there and that would take care of the battle would take care of the things and and you know David was a little Shepherd and I was thinking too about how you know how this all ties together with the first people that David was concerned about his flock and the first people that heard about the good news were little Shepherds out in the field and brother Brown talked about why did they have to be Shepherds the lowly and the meek but you know I believe that God has you know brother uh Ronald Reagan used to talk about a trickle down economy how how how the economy would trickle down and whatnot and I believe God kind of has a trickle down economy and it works kind of like this uh when when John in Revelations he saw uh one of the the four beasts would come and say come and see and John would go look and he would see and then he was able to speak it and then it just keeps trickling down brother brandom was able to go and see and he got the Revelation and he was able to go and speak it and then brother Dale let's say it like that he got the Revelation is able to speak it and I'm sitting out there and I get the Revelation and now I'm able to go speak it and it keeps trickling down the little housewife gets the Revelation and she can speak it to her kids and on down on down because God reveals himself that way God puts somebody maybe the the messenger of mercy and Grace to your little children is is your little Mam and and uh in the home cooking and whatnot talking about God in the kitchen because you've received something through God's trickle down economy through God speaking his word down from from from the four beasts all the way down through the through his economy that way that's and oh where am I now now the one I I want to I want to talk about was uh God's God's mercy now you remember that little story of the the uh brother R like to talk about the story of Elisha and the shunamite woman how she she was she was paying attention and Along Came Elija and she said I perceive that that's a man of God she saw the things that were happening she saw the things that were taking place and she knew that something was special about that and you know the first time maybe when you first heard about this message it was in a a strange way I I knew um I knew some older brothers and sisters that when they first heard about the message it was through a brother that told him that you have an evil spirit on you now how many of us could take that and they and they uh they they they they said well there's there's something to this and they caught hold to it and went and followed after it and you know that maybe this little this little uh shunamite woman from someplace that maybe wasn't on the map hardly but she she caught something that God was doing now now let's fast forward to when that remember when that pre that plane was delayed yeah and brother brandham was walking along and he didn't know where he was going he was follow following the leading of the spirit and he was on a Mission of Mercy a mission of Grace because that little woman now the the little the little washer woman had done something that you can do today and that is identify yourself with what is shown in the scripture and she found somebody in the scripture that she could identify with and she said remember she told Brother random I am like that shunamite woman right but now God God has shown me who I am but now where is Elijah where is Elisha and she was looking looking for the one that was recorded in the Bible because she had so closely identified herself now you can identify yourself in scripture when you can see yourself in the scripture then it becomes not just letters on the page but it comes something living inside of you that you know uh you know she knew that God was the same yesterday today and forever and he would have to meet her need because now remember if you have something a need in your life and you're hungering and thirsting to line up with God God's word God will send you somebody to help you do it to show you how to do it sir and she was hungry and thirsty she had God had given her a child just like that woman in the Bible and she was hungering and thirsting and crying out to God for God to send her an Elijah and he came upon the seen and and raised her child up and uh you know years later he ran into him in in I think it was a bus stop or something because she identified herself with the scripture and she got Mercy because Mercy raised her child up and and and mercy and Grace right paid a visit to her house on that day yeah now I I kind of wanted to you know when I first started we read in second joh uh Grace be with you mercy and peace from God the father and I want to tie that together with Mark 16:15 which says and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature yes because that's kind of what I'm leading up to this is how God manifest his Mercy amen or one way you know he he uh he can pay you a visit when you're on your knees but you know you've got to hear about the gospel you got to hear about his Mercy whether it's from reading what John wrote or listening to what brother brandham said because uh well we've all been hearing it the last few weeks that the seed comes through the body you've got to hear uh like philli speaking to the Ethiopian unit let me explain this to you and Philip brought Mercy to the Ethiopian unit and so the the last commission the great Great Commission right just before Jesus went up to the father he said and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature now he didn't say just go to the good people but he said go into all the world he didn't say just go to one of the three kinds of Believers but to go to all all three kinds the unbelievers the make believers the real Believers every one of them right and preach the gospel and you know what not just to the Believers but to Every Creature Amen to Every Creature because uh and you know in Paul in Colossians 1:23 he said if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which you have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven where of I Paul and made a minister I believe he was confessing making his confession that I have preached it to every everywhere I've gone I've preached it to every creature and you know brother Brandon preached it to Every Creature he calls a little fishy that's he he preached the gospel to a little fishy and that little fishy came back to life he preached the gospel to the to the storm and the storm ceased he preached the gospel to uh uh had right's two boys and they gave their life to the Lord and He preached the gospel to that tomor and his wife and it fell away because the there's power there's mercy and Grace in the in the gospel and in the in the gospel first Mercy has has to be preached so that you can accept it and I believe that's the way the Bible is laid out because first you can look at the Old Testament and see that uh you know there's how can I keep the law there's no way to uh keep the law and then in the New Testament Jesus magnifies the law if you even look upon a woman with lust in your heart you committed adultery already in your heart how how can you keep all of these Commandments can you keep this but what it does is it convicts you of sin it causes you to realize that there's iniquity in your life and then you can accept the grace of God and you know sometimes I wonder if maybe you know I I know this is kind of a simple little topic but I I wonder sometimes if uh you know we we can explain the Deep things but can we explain you need to be saved you need you need Mercy you need you need Grace and you know Paul Paul said it like this in Romans 1:16 for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God into salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also the Greek the gospel is not just letters on a page dos and don'ts but it is the power of God and he said I am not ashamed of the Gospel I'm not ashamed to tell it like it is to tell you and I was talking to somebody recently and they uh the the person that hadn't been in church in many many years and they were saying but I I love God and I I told them you know the Bible says if you love me you'll obey my Commandments because that is the real love of God is to do his Commandments and you know many times when you tell people the truth they turn and and get upset with you but Paul was not ashamed to tell the truth he was not ashamed to tell it like it was and when somebody tells it like it is don't look like uh they did at the brass Serpent and say I'm I'm not going to uh you I don't like that brother he's he's telling it too straight he's not he's not uh stroking my fur the right way yeah and uh at Romans 16:26 Paul said but now is made manifest and by the scriptures of the prophets according to the Commandment of the Everlasting God made known to All Nations for The Obedience of faith the gospel was made known to Every Nation everywhere in the power and demonstration of the spirit and that's what that's what living a Christian life is just letting that that the power and demonstration of the spirit radiate from within that's what preaching is is preaching by your own experience letting that own your own third pool experience come out that the the things that God has done for you come out so that other people can partake of the same Mercy mercy and Grace not trying to beat over the head like like in John bu's book like Moses riding the back of Christian beating him but pulling and drawing based on my experience to draw you into the same Fellowship that I believe that I have and so the gospel must be preached to every creature and you know a lot of times it it seems like the gospel is so hard to sell but it shouldn't be it's not like you're selling a used car where you got to convince somebody that the tires aren't falling off or you got to convince somebody that the the the transmission doesn't have problems but it should be when someone hears about the mercy that God has given that he has risen from the dead that he said lo I am with you always that he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned these simple truths that it should be it should sell itself and I I believe it does I believe it does to somebody that's hungering and thirsty now just because you put the Brazen serpent up or that Moses did doesn't believe that everyone will look at it that's just a simple fact of fact of life but the gospel the go there's such power in the gospel and the simple truth of the Gospel that it will it it sells itself and you know there's there's the go the power of the Gospel the power of mercy and Grace in a believer's life in Luke 10:17 it gives Power To Tread on serpents and scorpions power over all the power of the enemy power for a relationship with God and transforming power to fulfill his word and I but first you got to come to the realization that you need God's grace that you need his Mercy when you realize that you have iniquity in your life you know Paul uh uh second Thessalonians it's written Paul was talking about the mystery of iniquity do already work such a a mystery of of that there is Iniquity and and and it needs to be removed from your life and that we can see that now being removed by the by the revealing of God's word now you I remember Zechariah chap 3 and when zerubba was going to build the temple and uh Zachariah saw that vision of of Joshua standing there with Satan to his right and accusing him and then Joshua had filthy rags on him filthy his own iniquity that iniquity was taken away and he he was given a new garment mercy and Grace he saw he needed mercy and Grace was given to him that his filthy rags were were uh taken away and I want to maybe Jump Ahead to this little story that I think is so powerful in uh Second Kings chapter 20 let me get another drink of water now maybe this is a story that um I I believe we're a lot of us are familiar with I'm just going to read um from Second Kings if you got a sco fill Bible is Page 447 I'll read from verse one down to about verse 13 just to kind of set the stage in those days was Hezekiah sick unto death and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amos came to him and said unto him thus sayith the Lord set thine house in order for Thou shalt die and not live then he turned his face to the wall and prayed unto the Lord saying I beseech thee Oh Lord remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and Hezekiah WEP sore now that's when when you have nothing between you and your savior that's when you can come and confidence and ask God and believe that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek seek Him believe believe that he will reward you and what a great testimony that Hezekiah had that he had a perfect heart and had done that which is good in God's sight right and Hezekiah whipped sore and it came to pass before Isaiah was going out into the middle court that the word of the Lord came to him saying turn again and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people thus saith the Lord the god of David the father I have heard thy prayer I have seen thy tears behold I will heal thee on the third day Thou shalt go up under the house of the Lord now I know we've all heard this story we've all heard brother Ram tell it but I I think it's so powerful how that that you know many times we need healing and things in our own body but uh I wonder if we maybe have faith like Hezekiah did that even though a prophet had come and told him that he was going to die but he got down on his knees and believed that God would answer his prayer and held up before God his life and said I've done that which has been was perfect I've tried to live a a life holy before you and I will and and and uh God told Isaiah I will add into thy days 15 years and I will deliver thee in this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria and I will defend this city for my own sake and for my servant David's sake and Isaiah said take a lump of figs and and so forth and and so Hezekiah was Hezekiah was given another 15 years to live now what's interesting about it and we know how God God knew God knows the end from the beginning he knows not only what will happen but the possibilities I believe he he knew that if brother brandom had gone up and lived do hermit that that he you know he showed him that trash uh the trash pile that this this is what your life would have been and we know God knows what would have been and believe he knew what would have been if Hezekiah would have kept living that's why it was time for him to go so that he could keep that testimony of a perfect life but he he went and showed all the after after his life was extended he went and showed all the secrets of of God's house to the enemies and they got began to get jealous and and and marred his testimony but now he his life was extended another 15 years but in the third year he had this little boy named man manasse which turned out to be one of the worst Kings in in in all of Israel and manasse lived just uh he he let's read about some of the things that Manasseh did that's uh you know in in uh in the king first and second I can't remember I think it's Second Kings that talks about all the things that he did but I'm going to turn over to 2 Chronicles because Second Kings kind of leaves you hanging it doesn't tell all of the details you have to turn over to 2 Chronicles 3C to what God see what God did from Manasseh despite all of the evil that Manasseh had done in his life so I'm going to read from second chronicles 33 start at verse one manasse was 12 years old when he began to Reign and he reigned 50 and 5 years in Jerusalem but did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord like unto the Abominations of the Heathen whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel for he build again the high places which hezekiah's father had broken down and he reared up altars for balum and made Groves and worshiped all the host of heaven and served them also he built altars in the house of the Lord where of the Lord had said in Jerusalem shall my name be forever and he built altars for all the host of Heaven and the two courts of the house of the Lord and he calls his children to pass through the fire in the Valley of the son of henm also he observed times and used enchantments and used Witchcraft and dealt with a familiar spirit and with Wizards and the list get is getting pretty bad he wrought much evil in the sight of the Lord to provoke him to anger and he set a carved image the idol which he had made in the house of God of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son in this house and in Jerusalem which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel will I put my name forever neither will I anymore remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have appointed for your fathers so that they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses so manasse made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to Heir and to do worse than the Heathen whom the Lord had destroyed before the children of Israel now let's stop that right there for a second because many times we look at manasse or we look at one another the same way we're looking at manasse right now that he's Beyond hope there's no way to him to be restored to to fellowship with God and you know uh there there comes a time that when you can exhaust all Mercy when God calls you and calls you and calls you and hardens your heart and you don't hear as please anymore but as long as you're hungering and thirsting for God and I you know I I keep hearing tales and you know you don't know all the details about people coming to to to give their life to the Lord and and being turned away by ministers and saying you've you've passed beyond all hope and now that's one thing two things that I I I I I I'll say I I don't intend to ever do is one is tell somebody they've got the Holy Ghost and the other is tell somebody they have gone too far cuz you can't tell somebody they've got the I I don't believe you can cuz that's a personal revelation to them and and you can't tell somebody that they've gone too far because they will say it from their own mouth I don't want to remember that girl that that brother Brandon was talking to that she said if I saw my own Mama frying over Hill it wouldn't you know her heart was had grown so cold because she had turned God down so many times but now look at manasse and all the things that he's done and and this is my my my story a story of mercy and Grace amen how if you still are longing to come back to God and God Pricks your heart then there's still an opportunity for mercy and that's that's my my theme tonight is that all things are possible to them that believe and I was thinking earlier that it just it just staggers me to you know we were talking about the things that are how Mercy is removed from the Christian EXP experience how we can sing Listen to the brother brand sing that song all things are possible and then we'll remove uh the ability for somebody to get saved as we're singing all things are possible only believe only believe and that's that was really the the the theme of brother brandom's healing meetings his ministry was all things are possible if thou can't believe if thou can't believe it doesn't matter what your genealogy looks like if th can't believe then you can receive your healing if thou can't believe then there's an opportunity for salvation so verse n so Manasseh made Judah and then abidance of Jerusalem to Heir and to do worse than the Heathen whom the Lord had destroyed before the children of Israel and the Lord spake to manasse and to his people but they would not hearken wherefore the Lord brought unto them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria which took Manassa among the thorns and bound him with feathers and carried him to Babylon and there bound among the Thorns is where manasse got a change of heart and when he was in Affliction he besought the Lord his God and humbled himself greatly before the god of his fathers now I believe this is the the ground this lays the groundwork for the New Testament doctrine of if somebody is doing something that they ought living in sin then put them in God's hands and let him put them in thorns and affliction and they will watch him run back to God and so he was when he was in Affliction he besought the Lord his God and humbled himself greatly before the god of his fathers and prayed unto him and he was intreated of him and heard his supplication and brought him again to again to Jerusalem into his into his kingdom then manasse knew that the Lord he was God now there there's a great story of of of Mercy and I believe that that same you get in your head that in the Old Testament that God was there was no mercy in the Old Testament that God was a a hateful Jehovah and in the New Testament now he's he's merciful but you remember the story of David how David got the he when he numbered Israel he got the choice of of to be thrown into the hands of God or or to be thrown into the hands of man and he said oh I would rather be thrown into the hands of God way at throw me throw me straight into his hands because God is merciful and slow to anger and so many you know David knew we look at knowledge on the statute of a perfect man now David knew who his God was because he had a fellowship with him and he said in Psalm 528 but I am like a green olive tree in the house of God I trust in the mercy of God forever and ever and in 2 Samuel 24:14 what I was just I was just reading us and talking about in 2 Samuel 24 David said unto Gad I am in a great straight let us fall now into the hand of the Lord for his mercies are great and let me not fall into the hand of man now you know we're just reading about the story of Manasseh but now brother brandom when he would refer to the the seven Redemptive names of Jehovah a lot of times he would throw in Jehovah Manasseh which is not one of the seven Redemptive names of Jehovah and and uh manasse has an interesting meaning it means he forgets now if you look at the way when brother brandom uses Jehovah manasse put those two together Jehovah Manasseh and what do you end up with is that God forgets God forgets all of our all of the things that we've done just like manasse he forgets all of the now I I was watching uh I don't know if any of you ever watched Kirk Cameron and Ray Comfort do their you they kind of have a neat little television thing where I mean radio show uh I've seen some of their YouTube clips I don't watch TV uh but but um they they'll they had this thing where they were a debting atheist and one of them rose up and said now what I find it hard to believe is that that um that somebody that's well just like manasse did has done Witchcraft and enchantments and but the way they were is somebody that was a murderer a thief and and rattled off all these horrible sounding things that as soon as they come to God and and really repent that God wipes the Slate clean and that's a that's a that's an amazing thing isn't it and that doesn't really fit in with our concept of Justice we want people to pay you've got to suffer but God wipes the Slate clean for of a repentant heart and that's the grace of God I it's just it's just beyond imagining that God can do that you know I was reading through some of a list of some of the uh prisoners that had written into the voice of God website they post some of the uh letters from prisoners and it's just amazing the testimonies that they have things like now I I'm so glad that I finally found the truth I'm so glad that I know know the truth now and just just wonderful testimonies from people that you don't know their background you don't know but what they live lives similar to manasse but Manasseh uh I believe he found out that all things are possible to them that believe and Hebrews 7:25 says he was able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him now I had some interesting quotes because I I believe sometimes we struggle with that just that little simple all things are possible POs to them that believe and I I got I I I one of my favorite books is FF Bosworth's U Christ the Healer and because he he goes through you know brother R said nobody could explain healing like FF Bosworth and he explains one of the first things he deals with is that people believe yes I believe that in healing but it's so difficult sometimes to believe that healing is for me is it God's will to heal me is it God's will to save me and that's what I'm talking about this morning that God's mercy has been extended to us and if we'll receive his Mercy then it can be made manifest to it when you say well I've already got the Holy Ghost well maybe you need healing in your body maybe you need uh a little bit of extra from God because God's grace you can never exhaust God's grace do you know brother R said that God wants you to ask hard things and the hard things we'll think a hard thing is God help me I don't have enough money to buy a car help me to buy get a car or whatever but that things like that are are are small to God but the hard things are God help me the big things to God are help me to be a better Christian help me to live closer to you God put virtue in my life so much that it just bubbles out and just overflows that everybody can come and drink freely from the Fountain of Life that God has put in me and God put the knowledge of who you are and me and now those are big things and you know a lot of times in our mind will flipflop the big things to us are little to God and the little to us are big to God and maybe we need to get our mind lined up with his word so that so that to see things the way he sees them and and then maybe we'll start moving up the statue a little bit faster now let's see where I am in these in these notes um let's let's start off in 1956 1208 cuz I I want to backtrack a little bit and show how that when when you're hungry and thirsting for righteousness for Mercy that God will send somebody on the scene let's look at 1956 1208 Abraham in Brooklyn New York paragraph e86 now here's a woman he knows the woman I don't know the lady I've never met you in my life there's not a way for me to know you but now if the Lord Jesus will speak again will it take all the superstitions and doubt from you now here she comes seeking mercy and he says now remember he's permitting this this is his grace to you and to me see by permitting a Divine gift to operate now let's go to the angel of the Covenant 1954 1954 March please believe him if there's anything that I could do to help you I'd do it if there's one thing I could do to help anyone and wouldn't do it I'd be a brute not to do that but the reason I'm here trying to represent our Lord is because I believe by his Mercy to let me do it I believe I can help you to see him and believe him and be healed and that's how mercy and Grace is administered by God will send somebody on the scene to open your eyes to reveal to you to take to to take un loose the Yoke of the bondage of the things of this world uncover your eyes to take the scales off of your eyes like the prophet that prayed for Paul that the scales were over his eyes and he prayed for him and they came off and he can see clearly I believe I can help you to see him and believe him and be healed don't be scared that's the reason you can't receive is because you're afraid it won't happen now how about that the reason you can't receive is because you're afraid it won't happen when all the promises of God's word are laid out before us amen all the promises that we can rest upon like Psalm 501 14:15 offer unto God Thanksgiving and pay thy vows under the most high and call upon me in the day of trouble I will deliver thee right and thou shalt glorify me amen Galatians 5:116 this I say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh woo that's a promise amen walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh if you walk in the spirit James 4:7 submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you now we have all these promises but do we believe them like like I've heard brother Dale say before we've got all the tapes and everything uh maybe he didn't say exactly like this but now do we believe everything the prophet said do we believe all the words that the prophet has spoken do we believe everything do we believe it's for us that's the reason you can't receive is because you're afraid it won't happen just as in your mind it's already happened see faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen that's right let's see I'll skip over that one skip over that one let's skip down to love in 1957 because this is what I and I think I'll go ahead and end on this just wrap up in a in just a few minutes but what you know like FF bondworth who's trying to in the little book Christ the Healer trying to get across and he's got some just wonderful scriptures laid out there to to battle that the the idea in your mind that it's not for me that healing is for somebody else well the same thing applies for salvation or the same thing for any of God's blessings asking big things to God anybody else somebody else can brother Dale can ask for big things but I can't or or anybody you got to be somebody somebody special but uh in God In Love 1957 uh May 19th paragraph e66 now Christ is here and I declare to you he's raised from the dead he loves you he wants your soul he wants to heal you he wants to make you happy he wants to bring you up in the glory he can only do it as you permit him to do it he can't do it against your will now we do we believe that he loves us that he he wants to heal us that he wants to make us happy now I so many I've got a book called The imitation of Christ that talks about how God that we grow closer to God through suffering now does God want us to suffer sometimes sometimes suffering is a means to an end like manasse when you when you sin and things and God puts you through the thorns a little bit like manasse but it's to bring you out so that you can be happy because God when you're happy you can serve God better when your home is at peace when your home is at every everything in your life is just orderly then you can serve God so much so much better and you know I believe that's one of the things you can bring before God if you're sick or whatever Lord please deliver me of this so so that I can serve you better so that I can walk before you greater in 1957 uh 602 e54 when we think about these things when we think about those things how great and wonderful oh he's real to us won't it be wonderful there the great physician is now present he wants to heal the sick and The Afflicted he wants to make those who are weary to be strong he wants to make those who are afflicted be well that's right now maybe a stumbling block you know FF PA will walk through all the different things that there stumbling blocks in our minds Paul's Affliction did Paul God want Paul to be sick uh what about the pool of Bethesda did uh why did God why did Jesus pass by all those people well you know brother brandom explained it that people would come up to him and say heal my uncle or pray for my uncle or whatever somebody that may not have even heard the gospel before first you must receive mercy first you got to you know cuz people would come in the prayer line and say uh heal my uh you know brother brother say well you're not even a Christian but if you'll just accept Christ right here on the prayer line they would accept Christ and be healed immediately after that that all that's one thing that always just Boggle my mind is that just two seconds after they said I I'll accept the pardon that Christ made that they could they would receive their healing just that quick but now you you've got to accept AC that mercy and they had to accept that Mercy just that quick on the on the platform they would accept it and and receive the grace he wants to make those who are afflicted be well in a time of decision 1959 April 18th now let me see where I should start now you've got to make up your mind you've got to make a choice and this may be your last time to make a choice tomorrow May too late God might have chose you to eternal life but if you don't make up your mind and accept it somebody else will take your place exactly that's right that's something to think about now and you remember that that quote that brother Dale read that that the reason you don't accept it when you're 12 years old is because there's a devil keeping you from that and you got if you can just receive it receive the truth and accept it and be delivered from that and if you don't see what the consequences my somebody else will take your place maybe tomorrow will be that time God may be wanting to empty this whole row of wheelchairs here tonight I know he does look at that now I know he does I know God wants to empty this whole row of wheelchairs here tonight I know he does he may be I know he wants to heal every sick person here tonight you'll have to make your choice what's keeping us from walking closer to God what's keeping us from receiving our healing what's keeping us from receiving the blessings that are written in God's word for us is that we're afraid we're unwilling to just Reach Out by faith and take it right and Witnesses 1956 now he is here tonight or he he said something that he can't back up and to think that someone would say that God put Affliction upon people to make them be his servants oh friend that's an error of the devil right if God Made You Afflicted so you could be patient and he could show his Mercy to let you suffer then when Jesus come he absolutely protested what God did he healed everyone he come in contact with then he done exactly what God made the people sick for his glory and Jesus come down and heal them then he took the glory off of them by healing them could you imagine that no sir not at all Jesus don't want you to suffer right listen friends people who say that the Pagan of Africa can produce a better God to the people my what a challenge than to say that God wants us to suffer the pagans can produce something better than something like that right no wonder we got communism God don't want you to suffer he wants you to be well he died for that purpose he don't want you to suffer he wants you to be well and he's made one basic thing if you'll believe he sent sent his word he sent his son he sent his prophets he sent law he sent everything and today sent the Holy Spirit to continue the ministry that Jesus did when he was here on Earth if we believe if we believe in God's mercy and his grace that he sent To Us by men that'll tell us about it then we can receive His blessings right if we'll receive it now uh I I'm just going to I'm going to finish here I guess the mus can go ahead and come forward but now remember Mercy Mercy ran to forgive the prodical son and then Grace threw a party right Mercy bandaged up the wounds of the of the man beaten up by the robbers and then the Sam Good Samaritan came along and bandaged him up and then he took him to the hotel and he paid the price of his recovery he gave out that gold corn Mercy heard the cry the thief on the cross and Grace promised in Paradise that same day amen that same hour that same minute Mercy paid the penalty for our sin and Grace substitutes God's righteousness in Christ for our wickedness Mercy converted Paul on the road to Damascus and Grace called him to be an apostle Mercy closed the door to hell and Grace open the door to Heaven do we believe that do we believe all all the promises of God are true I don't know how to stop I guess I'll I've just turn it over to brother Dale so if you stand amen bless you mercy and Grace that's it 174 in Red Book anybody have a need then come and let's see mercy and grace we'll talk with Jesus and enjoy that I once was lost in sin Jesus took me here and then a little life anybody have a need just come and enjoy the grace you believe it you believe mercy and Grace goes together little fire is burning you of cheer and then what about it look at even manasse after all he done Grace came on the grace provided it didn't he why
