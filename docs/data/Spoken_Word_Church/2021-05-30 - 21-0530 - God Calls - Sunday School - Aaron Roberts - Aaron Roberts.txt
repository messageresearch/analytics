TRANSCRIPT
========================================
bless y'all this morning good to be in the house of the lord and just bear with me for a minute it's always good to be in the house the lord and good to have some of my family with us this morning it's always good to see each one of you because each one of you is my family also so good to see brother daniel sister debbie this morning i want to speak a little thought about god calling god calls and start with genesis chapter 3 beginning of verse 8. and it says and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where art thou and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself you know we never we never go never have look man has never looked for god that man has never sought for god it's always been god looking for man god's always sought there's always salt man and you know john chapter 6 verse 44 says no man can come to me except the father which sent me draw him says i will raise him up at the last day so you know we get we don't look for god god looks for us and you know when god starts to cough just like adam we have a real tendency to run from god we don't you know because if people say well i sought god well if you stop god you'd be looking for him but the scripture tells us that it's the goodness of god that leadeth to repentance it's god calling us and it's the goodness of god that calls us ii peter 3 9 says the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering toward us not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance so you know we the the world's full of people that are looking they're looking for something and they don't know what they're looking for and many times you go to speak to people and you know they brother i'm talking about people having a thirst having a desire for something they don't know what to fulfill that desire people bounce from one thing to the other and they're all the time trying to find something that's going to satisfy that thirst and they don't know what that thirst what will fulfill that thirst in their life and you know they they go from one they think they'll find something that's going to fulfill that thirst that that desire that's inside of them and they'll some people will chase it with everything that they have when they chase it then after a while it it becomes unfulfilled there's no joy there there's there's no fulfillment in it so they go to something different they look for something else and you know the world they're all the time trying to find stuff and you see people that are you know alcoholics drug addicts you know they they want to find something they want to find the next high they want to find the next fulfillment and they can't find anything and then they go to the next thing and it doesn't fulfill and they go to the next one and you know some people they chase they chase money and and they've they've spent all their time trying to find this fulfillment in money and it's like well you know if i if i make more money than i made last year you know they and then you know they they make more money than they can spend or anybody could spend and you know they don't they don't they're still not fulfilled right you know they talk about napoleon you know napoleon had this great desire to conquer the world and here he was up trying to conquer the whole world and when he conquered the known world and didn't have anybody worth fighting anymore then he was he was depressed because he didn't have nobody else to fight because you know he had reached these goals and he couldn't nothing satisfied but let me tell you something there's nothing in this world like jesus christ there's nothing in this world like him that we can that god calls us many are called but few are chosen but god calls us and what did god call us for god didn't call us just to call us but god called us for a purpose so you know many times in our lives we wonder what that purpose is what god calls us what's that purpose is to fulfill his word god has a god has a purpose for each one of our lives and you know sometimes we we wonder you know if it's if it's how important it is well many times we look at our our lives and and the call that god has placed in our lives what god placed in our lives is does it does doesn't measure up to other people's standards you know because we look we want to look at ourselves through other people's eyes but you know the only person that you and i should try to to uh honor and i don't want to use the word worry but i but but to have such a zeal to fulfill what god wants us to do is you know we sing that song is the lord satisfied with me is is god satisfied with my life does is the honor and glory of the scripture tells us that he called us into this kingdom of honor and virtue is that the same honor that we give to god in our lives not just not just to in the worship of our lips but in our worship and of our lives the h each thing that we do in this world because that's what god wants us to do god wants us to be god called us for a purpose you know this the scripture tells us in luke 19 when he's speaking to he's speaking to zacchaeus and zacchaeus he says for the son of man has come to seek and save those which were lost first corinthians 1 9 says god is faithful by whom you were called unto the fellowship of his son jesus christ our lord so we've been called into a fellowship with him and if we've been called into this fellowship then you know god has a a promises and it calls us into um blessings and so if we've been called to these blessings then that was what god you know wants us to have and god wants us to use these things and you know if he said he said that we are heirs of god and join heirs with christ and you know the things that christ has that he wants us to have and he wants that he wants us to be beneficiaries of those things and and to use those things and walk in the liberty the scripture tells us that you know we should walk worthy of the calling that god has given us and you know you know and sometimes you know the devil wants us to have a different view vision of ourselves or a different view of of what we should what we should be but you know god has called us and that's when we look to see what our our vision should be our vision should be what the word says to look into the word and see ourselves see our see ourselves for who we are even even if you have shortcomings you know the thing is is there's a there's a blessing there because you can see where you've fallen short for all have seen to come short of the glory of the lord but the thing is the word gives us the opportunity that we can become right that we can come back into fellowship with him because if if we have if we have a a sin or something there's a way back that we can be right before god that anything that comes before us there's a way god has already made provisions for us that we can come and and all of the issues that we have in life you know many times people well i don't know what i'm going to do well i don't know what i'm going to do well i know what i'm going to do because god given us away god give us a way to call on his name and ask you know because he'll lead and guide us if we'll ask he's already had the answer before we even ask for it but he wants you to ask the scripture said to ask that our joy might be full so we have to ask and god can bring these things to us in acts 2 very familiar scripture in acts 2 beginning at verse 36 and the scripture tells us when when the disciples came out of the upper room and you know they were staggered around like drunk people and you know people was wondering what what in the world was going on but peter stood up and told him said you know these people aren't drunk as you suppose but he said this is that which was spoken of by the prophet joel you know many people had read the scripture but they had never seen the manifestation of it they had their own idea what the scripture was but they didn't see the manifestation of it but peter says therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god hath made that same jesus whom ye have crucified both lord and christ and he said now when they heard this they were picked in the heart and he said unto peter and unto the rest of the disciples men and brethren what shall we do then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to them that are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call so when god began to call man god had a plan and a purpose for for man to follow and the scripture says when when the day of pentecost come because that's what it was to be the fulfilling of the scripture was the indwelling of the spirit it was to come back upon man to come back into fellowship true fellowship would with god and he called and he said you know they asked him what should we do he said repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ very simple prescription that was given but he said but it was a promise and he said this promise is unto you and to your children and to them that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call and you know i'm glad to proclaim today that god's still calling if he's called one he'll call he'll call he's continuing to call right he said the only thing that we've got to do is we've got to meet the same criteria we've got to come to the same basis have the same faith that those met he said he said if he ever healed one he'll heal him again but you and i have to come on the same basis the first one came on and he said he said if you if you have a need this morning that he's here to meet that need and he said he said if he's called one and he give him the gift of eternal life then you know he's still given that gift of eternal life today and it's unto each one and he said he said it's to you and to your children so you know what as parents we can stand up and proclaim to our children we can claim our children that we can claim them because if he done it for us he'll do it for them he said to them that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call so if he's ever called one he'll continue to give and he's still calling today the question is is do you and i are those that god calls do they answer that call because god is calling second peter chapter one verse verses 3 and 4 says according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that retain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust so god has called us to this and these are the promises that god has made to us that we can receive the divine nature that we can bypass these things god has given us a way to become like him hebrews 9 says 14 15 says how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgression that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance first thessalonians 2 11 to 13 says as you know how we exhorted and comfort and charged every one of you as a father doth his children that ye would walk worthy of god who have called you into his kingdom and glory for this cause also thank god we think we god without ceasing because when ye received the word of god which you heard of us you received it not as the word of men but as it is in truth the word of god which effectually worketh also in you that believe so when we've heard the word we must receive the word and the scripture says that we've become the word as we receive the word because the script the word receiving the word we have received that power to become the sons of god because he said he came to his own and his own received him not but as many as believed so if we believe on the word not that it's the words of man you know many people they they want to spend all their time you know trying to dispute this part of this part or whatever but you know what if if we believe what god says if it's the word of god then you know what he'll bring it to pass you put your trust in god and he he'll show you what the truth is because he'll lead you and guide you you know many times brother i'm talking about the different ones and you know sight and time is the biggest hindrance god has and you know the thing is is people people you know they want to some a quick fix or they want to answer right now or whatever but you know you just hold on and wait for god and god will give you the answer you know god's never late god's always on time you know when when jesus come to the tomb of lazarus you know mary and martha there you know and they were so upset that that jesus didn't come on when they called for him but you know he said i'm the resurrection and the life and they were looking for offer some you know off in the future what was going to take place but he was trying to tell them right now is the time i am the resurrection and the life now was the time see they didn't realize this was the time that god had given for the resurrect for him to raise lazarus was right then not something off in the future it's not something off in the future it's right now it's today today's the day of salvation today is the day of your miracle today is the day of of your answer whatever you're you're looking for today is that day so we can just look to god this morning today say lord whatever what am i looking for lord if you have a need open up your heart this morning let god speak to you and he'll give you what you have desire but you know what your desire is this morning we'll have the musicians come this morning i want to read one more scripture before i finish as the musicians are coming romans 8 28 8-31 says for we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if god before us who can be against us that's what i want to leave you with this morning if god's for you this morning who can be against you right amen let's all bow our heads heavenly father we just so thankful lord this
