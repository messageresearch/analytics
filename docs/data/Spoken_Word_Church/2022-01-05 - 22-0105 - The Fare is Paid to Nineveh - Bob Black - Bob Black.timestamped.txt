[5:45] let's go ahead and turn over in the book
[5:46] of jonah
[5:49] this is really one of my favorite books
[5:51] in the bible
[5:54] because uh
[5:56] it's there's it speaks of hope when
[5:58] you're when you're way down and
[6:00] and there's somebody you can turn to in
[6:02] time of trouble and
[6:04] confidence and delivery and all those
[6:06] kind of things
[6:10] so we'll read a little a little take a
[6:12] little thought from from the book of
[6:13] jonah
[6:14] the fair is paid to nineveh
[6:17] let's go to the lord in prayer lord god
[6:19] we're so grateful to be able to gather
[6:20] together around your word this this this
[6:23] afternoon lord in the middle of the week
[6:24] lord jesus and we just look to you for
[6:26] encouragement and helping this our lord
[6:28] god we're living in lord i pray lord
[6:30] that you'll open up the words lord as we
[6:32] read and dive into these things lord
[6:34] jesus that you'll open up the true
[6:35] interpretation of these scriptures lord
[6:37] jesus that we could we can probe that
[6:39] with our mind with our intellectual
[6:40] reasoning lord but it takes the power of
[6:42] the holy ghost to come and put things
[6:44] together into a revelation lord jesus so
[6:46] that everything fits properly
[6:48] lord that it gives us power in this hour
[6:51] lord jesus we pray lord that you'll just
[6:53] feel the liberty lord to move among us
[6:54] lord jesus and speak to the knees and
[6:56] help those that are in trouble and in in
[6:58] low places little god that you'll lift
[7:00] us up and encourage us tonight lord
[7:02] jesus
[7:03] granted lord did you just be at liberty
[7:04] to help us lord and move among us lord
[7:06] as we look to you the author and the
[7:08] finisher of our faith lord with faith
[7:10] believing lord god
[7:12] that you are a rewarder of those that
[7:14] diligently seek you we ask your blessing
[7:16] upon the word now in the name of the
[7:18] lord jesus christ
[7:21] now this is a story we're all familiar
[7:23] with so we'll just read the first three
[7:25] verses
[7:27] here and it says
[7:29] now the word of the lord came unto jonah
[7:31] the son of hematite saying
[7:33] arise and go to nineveh
[7:36] so the lord's telling jonah what he
[7:38] wants him to do go to nineveh that great
[7:40] city
[7:42] and cry against it for their wickedness
[7:45] has come up before me
[7:47] but jonah rose up to flee unto tarshish
[7:49] from the presence of the lord
[7:51] and went down to joppa and he found a
[7:53] ship going to tarshish
[7:55] so he paid the fare thereof and went
[7:57] down into it to go with them unto
[7:59] tarshish
[8:01] from the presence of the lord you may be
[8:03] seated the lord is a blessing to the
[8:05] reading of the word
[8:07] so jonah had jonah was presented like
[8:09] like every every believer every
[8:11] christian is today he was presented with
[8:13] two choices he was presented with a
[8:15] choice to go to nineveh to go to up to
[8:18] nineveh or to go to tarshish
[8:20] now you know brother branham always made
[8:21] the point when when there's a fly up
[8:24] here we're just going to press home you
[8:27] know the the devil likes to bother you
[8:29] sometimes
[8:31] but uh
[8:35] brother brown always made the
[8:36] distinction about jonah that that when
[8:38] jonah he had that uh
[8:41] when he when he made the decision to go
[8:42] to tarshish instead instead of going to
[8:44] nineveh that he he wasn't backslid now
[8:47] so we want to make that distinction here
[8:49] and just kind of set on that for a
[8:50] little bit and talk about it that jonah
[8:52] was not because he went to tarsus he
[8:53] wasn't backslid now in other words
[8:56] because he went to tarsus he wasn't he
[8:58] didn't stop going to church he didn't he
[9:00] didn't you know decide i'm going to go
[9:01] down to the pool hall and i'm going to
[9:03] get drunk and he didn't he he he he you
[9:06] know
[9:07] you look at and brother brown will make
[9:08] a point of reading in that the chapter
[9:10] where uh he down in the belly of the
[9:12] well he began to cry out to god i i know
[9:14] that if i turn and toward toward the
[9:16] temple and and pray that i've got
[9:18] confidence that you'll answer
[9:20] so jonah wasn't backslid and you know
[9:24] brother brown said uh we always talk so
[9:26] much about being a bachelor and
[9:28] everything he said i've always took up
[9:29] for jonah i did not believe that jonah
[9:31] was backslid of course backslidden means
[9:34] relapsing into bad ways or errors just
[9:37] to slide back into stuff that you know
[9:39] you ain't supposed to be doing to slide
[9:41] back and that that's why you know you
[9:43] you can look at the way that a
[9:44] christian's living and said well that
[9:46] that's not right you know what a
[9:47] christian is a christian supposed to be
[9:48] going to church and spoke supposed to be
[9:50] living right and doing right
[9:52] because when you're not you're you're
[9:54] backslid now he said many people condemn
[9:56] jonah and say well he was an old
[9:58] backslider he wasn't backslid a man of
[10:00] god the steps the footsteps of the
[10:03] righteous is ordered of the lord now you
[10:05] think about what brother brown is saying
[10:07] there when he's talking about that jonah
[10:08] wasn't backslid that what in other words
[10:11] jonah is living out a story he had to
[10:14] live out a story he had to go through
[10:16] this thing that one day jesus would be
[10:18] preaching and he he would be telling
[10:20] everybody as jonah was went down in the
[10:22] belly of the well for three days so
[10:23] almost the son of man would go down and
[10:26] and so even so a story that even now
[10:28] tonight i can preach on this and many
[10:30] other ministers down through the ages
[10:32] have preached on this same story taking
[10:35] examples out of this so
[10:37] he had to he had to live out a story
[10:39] because so god could make his his will
[10:41] manifest so we could see so we could
[10:43] observe so we can know he and the whole
[10:46] thing the whole thing was god was
[10:48] ordering his footsteps so that one day
[10:50] he could come out of that belly of the
[10:52] well
[10:53] to and preach to a people that worshiped
[10:55] a fish god they gone come out of that
[10:58] thing and they would see him coming out
[10:59] of there and and and preach like
[11:02] preach like a a house on fire on a windy
[11:04] day and save and deliver those people
[11:06] the whole thing was ordered of the lord
[11:08] now it might have looked you know jonah
[11:10] went through he had to go through a lot
[11:11] of a lot of rough times as this story
[11:13] unfolds
[11:14] it was it was really rough on him
[11:17] all the things that he had to endure the
[11:19] storm coming up and the casting lots and
[11:21] them saying i'm the one that they're
[11:23] casting lots for and and then then
[11:25] finally coming he's the one that's
[11:27] identified as the problem and they got
[11:28] to throw him overboard and up from the
[11:30] deep and the in the dead of night up
[11:32] from the deep comes
[11:34] there's a there's a
[11:35] i think there's a a fear of things in
[11:37] the deep ocean called thalassophobia
[11:40] the fear you think about something
[11:42] something in the deep ocean something
[11:44] coming up to get you and this thing that
[11:46] god had created for this special purpose
[11:48] came up to get him and and saved him and
[11:51] delivered him he was down in the belly
[11:52] of that thing for three days and three
[11:54] nights crying out to god his prayer was
[11:56] i lord i'm i'm in the bowels of hell the
[11:59] earth is swallowing me up all the the
[12:01] the frame of the earth is all around me
[12:04] and finally he was vomited up on the
[12:06] shore to go witness to the people now so
[12:09] but he wasn't he wasn't backslid he was
[12:11] a believer the whole time he was staying
[12:13] true to his calling
[12:14] my brother said the principle reason
[12:16] that i believe that he did this great
[12:18] thing here was because now now listen to
[12:20] this the reason why tar
[12:22] jonah went to tarshish
[12:24] the reason why jonathan went to tarsus
[12:26] he said the reason that he did this was
[12:28] because jonah was a jew
[12:31] and he was asked to go to a gentile city
[12:33] to cry out against it thinking
[12:36] that he would not be
[12:38] received
[12:40] so now the reason i've heard people
[12:41] preach on this before and they say that
[12:43] they would say that jonah was a jew and
[12:45] he didn't want to go preach to the
[12:46] gentiles that's not the point
[12:48] that he's trying to make he's trying to
[12:50] make the point that he had he had a
[12:52] responsibility that god had given to him
[12:54] and he was afraid that people would not
[12:57] listen to him
[12:58] he was afraid of what people's reaction
[13:00] to him would be if you think about maybe
[13:02] tonight how many people are afraid of
[13:04] what people will think if they raise
[13:05] their hand or afraid what they'll think
[13:07] if they testify are afraid what they
[13:09] people will think if they go to work and
[13:11] and tell people that they're a christian
[13:13] and afraid that if they dress right or
[13:15] do right that somebody what somebody
[13:17] will think and and you see jonah was he
[13:20] he said he was thinking that he would
[13:21] not be received because the gentiles
[13:24] would think
[13:25] what's this jew got to do with us
[13:28] what's this jew got to do with he was
[13:30] afraid of what other people would think
[13:32] and you brother brahm said you see it
[13:34] gives us a great thing here to see
[13:36] that god not only is god of the jew but
[13:39] he's god also of the gentile he is god
[13:42] of all people now you think about how
[13:44] that god they're they're
[13:47] jonah was given a commission to go
[13:49] preach to people that wasn't like him
[13:52] the deal preached to the gentile people
[13:53] and you know
[13:56] such a such a fantastic type that god is
[13:59] concerned about people all over the
[14:00] world he he wants to save anybody that
[14:03] will listen to him
[14:04] and maybe maybe jonah got hung up a
[14:06] little bit on that maybe maybe he was
[14:08] afraid of what they would what they
[14:10] would think because he he you know he
[14:12] knew that they didn't have all the
[14:13] background maybe all the teaching didn't
[14:15] come from all the the historicity and
[14:17] everything of the jews that didn't
[14:19] understand who abraham was and all them
[14:21] things but yet god is a god that loves
[14:24] he wants everybody to be saved he wants
[14:26] he wants the whole world to be saved
[14:28] that's why that scripture that we read
[14:30] so often john 3 in john 3 16
[14:33] john 3 15 if you go back to 15 it says
[14:35] whosoever believeth in him should not
[14:37] perish but have eternal life
[14:40] and then it's so important
[14:42] that god jesus repeated it again
[14:45] in verse 16 for god so loved the world
[14:47] that he gave his only begotten son that
[14:48] whosoever believeth in him shall not
[14:50] perish but have everlasting life have
[14:52] you ever noticed that before that it's
[14:54] repeated twice that he says it twice
[14:56] because it's so important that he loves
[14:58] he he wants everybody to be saved you
[15:00] got god made a way for everybody to be
[15:02] saved if you if you if you can believe
[15:04] it it's how strange today that in this
[15:07] hour that we're living in that is such a
[15:08] doctrine that that people that
[15:10] they want to place bands around god's
[15:12] grace they want to put bam people want
[15:14] to put bands around god's grace and say
[15:16] that only a certain people can be saved
[15:18] only only some if if you fall in the
[15:21] right category if you're now if you're
[15:22] not holy enough you can't be saved or if
[15:24] you're not born right you can't be saved
[15:26] here if your mama and daddy ain't just
[15:29] right if their situation just ain't just
[15:30] right then you can't be saved or if
[15:33] if you're not if you're not worthy in
[15:35] some way something that you didn't do
[15:36] just right then you can't be saved but
[15:38] you see the gospel preached and the
[15:40] truth open tears off the bands of it so
[15:43] that the so that you can have confidence
[15:45] you can have freedom that god wants to
[15:47] save you it doesn't matter what your
[15:48] background is
[15:50] it doesn't matter if you came from
[15:51] nineveh or tarsus or joppa or wherever
[15:54] god wants to save you
[15:58] and brother brown said that jesus was
[16:01] he was trying to show he said jesus was
[16:04] jesus was the jews were chosen
[16:07] he said he ju he chose the jews
[16:11] let me slow down so i can talk
[16:13] he chose to choose the jews was called
[16:16] god's chosen people and they were chosen
[16:18] for a specific cause that we're talking
[16:21] about grace grace now the grace to
[16:23] everybody and he said that cause was to
[16:26] give them the law
[16:28] and they could not keep it
[16:30] you think about that's the reason why he
[16:32] chose the jews
[16:34] now i know there's a you could go into
[16:36] all the different reasons why he chose
[16:37] the jews but th this is the this is what
[16:39] we're honing in on tonight though that
[16:41] he chose the jews to prove a people a
[16:44] people that were chosen to prove to
[16:46] everybody to prove to the world that you
[16:48] can't keep it that you can't you try to
[16:50] keep the law you try to do
[16:52] all the things that are required by the
[16:54] law and you're going to fall short
[16:55] somewhere
[16:56] he said that cause was to give them the
[16:58] law and they could not keep it the
[17:01] reason the cause was to show that they
[17:03] could not keep it and he and he he just
[17:05] showed by that people that the law could
[17:07] not be kept
[17:09] and that he was a god of righteousness
[17:11] and the law demanded righteousness but
[17:13] there was no grace in law to bring a man
[17:15] out no penalty was paid by the law but
[17:18] it taken grace to pay that penalty uh to
[17:20] where the law put us under
[17:23] grace in second corinthians jesus told
[17:26] christ told paul he said unto me my
[17:28] grace is sufficient for me my grace
[17:31] what a message that we have of grace
[17:33] that when we fall short there's grace to
[17:35] us that god has given us his grace it's
[17:38] so difficult for us to show grace to one
[17:40] another even but if you can see the
[17:42] grace of god that has been extended to
[17:44] you then you can show grace to others
[17:47] in ephesians chapter 2 it says but god
[17:49] who is rich in mercy for his great love
[17:51] wherewith he loved us even when we were
[17:54] dead and sins hath quickened us together
[17:56] with christ
[17:58] by grace are you saved
[18:00] by grace are you saved and hath raised
[18:02] us up together and made us sit together
[18:04] in heavenly places in christ jesus that
[18:07] in the ages to come he might show the
[18:09] exceeding riches of his grace
[18:11] his grace and his kindness toward us
[18:13] through christ jesus for by grace are
[18:16] you saved through faith
[18:17] it's his gracious gift you didn't
[18:19] deserve it grace is a gift that you
[18:21] didn't do nothing to deserve it he just
[18:22] give it to you it says grace
[18:25] and that not of yourselves it is the
[18:27] gift of god he said not of works lest
[18:29] any man should boast you didn't do one
[18:31] thing to earn it you weren't born by you
[18:34] didn't have you didn't have to satisfy
[18:35] some requirement that your parents were
[18:37] born a certain way or do something you
[18:39] didn't have to do not one thing to get
[18:40] this gift but it was his grace that gave
[18:43] it to you all you got to do is believe
[18:45] in for it's by grace are you saved
[18:47] through faith
[18:48] faith for we are his workmanship
[18:51] created in christ jesus unto good works
[18:54] which god hath hath before ordained that
[18:56] we should walk in him
[18:58] you so so exhibit a will say exhibit a
[19:01] that you can't keep the law is the jews
[19:03] the jews sitting there going through all
[19:05] of the history that they have exhibit a
[19:07] you can look at the jews and say you
[19:08] can't keep it there's nothing that you
[19:10] can do in yourself within your own self
[19:13] but if you can get the grace of god that
[19:15] the grace of god can uh can allow the
[19:18] holy ghost to be put inside of you where
[19:20] that same life that was in christ can
[19:22] live in you then you become a law the
[19:25] law is actually written in tables of
[19:27] your heart
[19:28] you become you become the living
[19:30] manifestation of the law then the law
[19:32] will keep
[19:33] then you'll live the law amen
[19:37] now so jonah was our example
[19:39] here's our example of where we're always
[19:42] we're like brother brown said now he
[19:44] said we're always running from
[19:45] responsibility
[19:47] god gives us something to do and and we
[19:49] try we do whatever we can it's just
[19:51] human nature within our own human nature
[19:53] to run away from our responsibility
[19:56] he said every one of us we always are
[19:58] running from something
[20:00] we run from trouble we run from
[20:02] responsibility now maybe tonight just
[20:03] sit there and examine all the things
[20:05] that you've run from let's let's examine
[20:07] ourselves all the things that you in
[20:08] your own personal life that you your
[20:11] responsibilities are things that you've
[20:13] run from that you knew you should have
[20:14] done but you left undone that things
[20:17] that you should have apologized for and
[20:19] the things that you should have done
[20:21] differently and maybe maybe the things
[20:23] that you should maybe you should have
[20:24] started saving up a little money already
[20:26] only in your life you didn't just
[20:28] responsibilities
[20:30] that you you because we run from things
[20:32] our uh it's human nature to just just
[20:34] lay things over to the side and say well
[20:36] i'll catch up with it one day maybe one
[20:39] day one day i'm going to get born again
[20:41] one day i'll give my heart to the lord
[20:42] one day i'll come to church and do what
[20:44] i'm supposed to do one day he and
[20:46] brother i said we're all prone to that
[20:48] he said we are we are more prone to run
[20:52] than we are to stand and face it out
[20:54] we're more prone to run away from the
[20:56] thing than to just stand and face it out
[20:58] and deal with it
[20:59] he said we find ourselves running and
[21:02] now now brother brown he'll cover all
[21:04] these different things that we run from
[21:05] and one of the things that he covers is
[21:07] that one of one thing we run from is we
[21:10] run from work and i think how true that
[21:12] is in this day where it looks like
[21:15] nobody wants to do any work nobody wants
[21:16] to do a good a good honest work
[21:19] you know you even at my work it seems
[21:21] like you know
[21:22] you you try to you you're paying people
[21:25] to do their work but they don't do it
[21:27] and you have to constantly check up on
[21:28] people and constantly hound them and why
[21:31] is that because people are constantly
[21:33] running from work and he said sometimes
[21:35] we find ourselves prone to run from work
[21:37] we don't want to we don't want to work
[21:40] some people just think they can make
[21:41] their living without working
[21:45] now we i know we're getting down to
[21:46] where the rubber meets the road a little
[21:48] bit tonight but you know you it's your
[21:50] responsibility it's your respect you
[21:52] know god god uh
[21:54] he he'll train us up like like child
[21:57] training even god he wants to he wants
[21:59] to see how he how you deal with
[22:02] responsibilities so he gives you a
[22:03] little responsibility and he'll see what
[22:05] you do with it and as you and as you as
[22:08] you're able to deal with more and more
[22:10] responsibility you get a little bit more
[22:11] responsibility
[22:13] so but you see the problem is that a lot
[22:15] of we we will bow up when we when we get
[22:18] confronted with the responsibility
[22:21] you you think about these things tonight
[22:23] as i preach on these things it makes
[22:25] people blow up when you when you start
[22:27] talking to a young person maybe about
[22:29] about how you need to work how you need
[22:31] to get up be a church at a certain time
[22:33] be do do a thing at a certain time or
[22:35] whatever you you blow up that's why you
[22:37] see a lot of times the young people will
[22:39] they'll do the eye rolling and
[22:40] everything oh they do that rolling of
[22:42] the eyes and everything when you when
[22:43] you throw that responsibility in their
[22:45] face they'll roll those eyes around but
[22:47] you see what the adults are trying to
[22:49] see and what god is wanting to see in us
[22:51] is he wants to see how we deal with our
[22:53] responsibility when you tell somebody to
[22:55] go take out the trash and they roll
[22:56] their eyes around oh my god i can't
[22:59] believe anybody wanted me to be
[23:00] responsible then that shows that you're
[23:02] not ready to be you're not ready for
[23:04] some more responsibility
[23:06] what about us in the gospel when god
[23:07] wants to have us to have a little
[23:09] responsibility and we and we roll our
[23:11] eyes and say well i i don't i don't know
[23:13] about it or we we pitch a little fit or
[23:15] have a little tantrum well i don't know
[23:17] if i can believe that i don't know if
[23:18] i'm ready for that then god he he knows
[23:21] that we're not quite ready we're not
[23:23] quite at the place that we need to be
[23:27] so we're talking about work now
[23:29] he said we don't want to work
[23:31] he said some people just think they can
[23:32] make their living without working he
[23:34] said but i think solomon it was that
[23:35] said we could find here the answer and
[23:37] watching an ant now isn't that something
[23:39] that you can go out in your backyard and
[23:41] look down on the ground and find find
[23:44] more about working maybe that you can
[23:46] find anywhere else in the world just
[23:48] about go look at a little ant and
[23:49] recognize hmm
[23:51] that ant knows that if he doesn't get to
[23:53] work he ain't gonna eat in the winter
[23:55] all these animals in the woods know that
[23:57] if the bear if the bear doesn't doesn't
[24:00] uh fatten himself up in the way
[24:02] all year long all summer long come
[24:04] winter time he ain't going to be ready
[24:05] to hibernate there's going to be a
[24:06] problem so but we'll see we shirk we
[24:09] shark away from the responsibility of
[24:11] working
[24:12] he said if every ant doesn't work and
[24:14] lay in that aunt doesn't eat that winter
[24:17] so everybody has to work
[24:21] i was reading an article the other day
[24:22] where this this uh
[24:24] this woman was talking about how she she
[24:26] she believed that their society should
[24:28] get to a place where nobody has to work
[24:30] and i was thinking that's that's just
[24:32] contrary to just that's contrary to
[24:34] everything that's contrary to
[24:36] how you can look out in the in the in
[24:38] nature and just see how things work
[24:40] where you got to work you're you're here
[24:43] as long as we're we're here and not in
[24:45] the millennium not in that future home
[24:47] you gotta work you gotta that's your
[24:49] responsibility you gotta work and
[24:51] brother emma said we got so many things
[24:53] we have to do so much responsibility
[24:55] that we have to face
[24:56] everybody has got to face a certain
[24:59] responsibility so what are we talking
[25:01] about tonight we're talking about facing
[25:03] up with your responsibility facing up
[25:05] with it not shirking it but actually
[25:07] facing up to it
[25:08] a responsibility is the state or fact of
[25:11] being accountable or to blame for
[25:13] something when you're responsible for
[25:15] something you're the one that's to blame
[25:17] if it doesn't go right you're the one
[25:19] that is accountable in other words if if
[25:22] things fall apart in your life
[25:24] so many times we want to we want to make
[25:26] excuses and find somebody else that we
[25:28] can blame we want to blame we want to
[25:30] blame our spouse or we want to blame the
[25:32] pastor we want to blame the deacons or
[25:34] find somebody else but if we really if
[25:36] we really uh face our responsibility it
[25:39] really all comes back to us
[25:41] if our family isn't serving the lord if
[25:43] our children aren't serving the lord
[25:44] then that responsibility comes back to
[25:46] us responsibility is the state of being
[25:49] the person who caused something to
[25:51] happen when you're responsible you are
[25:53] the one that did it you know sometimes
[25:56] i'll get called at work on the weekends
[25:58] and you know somebody might say well why
[26:00] are they calling you because i'm the one
[26:01] i'm the manager of my team at work
[26:04] and if something breaks i'm the one
[26:05] that's responsible even if i didn't
[26:07] break it i got to be the one that
[26:09] answers the phone call and sits on the
[26:11] phone until it's fixed because i'm
[26:12] responsible even if it's in the middle
[26:14] of the night because i'm responsible and
[26:16] that's what being responsible means or
[26:18] being responsible means if you're
[26:19] supposed to be at church at a particular
[26:21] time to do a particular job then you'd
[26:23] be at church at a particular time to do
[26:25] to do the thing because you're the one
[26:27] that if if it all falls apart you're the
[26:29] one that's responsible when something
[26:31] breaks at work i'm responsible there's
[26:34] nobody else that i can blame you're the
[26:35] one that does it
[26:37] now brother said when you get married
[26:39] you've got to take a responsibility like
[26:41] you think about all the responsibility
[26:43] that comes when you get married
[26:45] maybe you build a home it's a pretty
[26:47] nice home and then you're responsible to
[26:49] pay that mortgage then you're
[26:51] responsible in your response to to do
[26:53] all the things that are wrapped up in
[26:55] and living in a home and he said then
[26:56] remember as a married woman
[26:58] you got to think of the responsibility
[27:00] of raising children so now you get
[27:02] married and you're responsible you you
[27:04] know i you know a lot a lot of these
[27:06] dads in here can maybe look back to
[27:08] remember that morning or that maybe that
[27:10] night that you came home and your wife
[27:12] was waiting on you to tell you i took a
[27:14] pregnancy test and and it was you'll
[27:16] never guess what it was and whoa that
[27:19] that weight of responsibility hit you
[27:21] that now things are going to be a little
[27:22] bit different because now you're not
[27:24] just responsible for you and your spouse
[27:26] but now you've got the responsibility
[27:28] you better be provide you you got to pay
[27:31] you got to work out some way to pay for
[27:33] that delivery bill when you when when
[27:35] your wife goes into delivery you got to
[27:37] be responsible for getting her to the
[27:38] doctor and you got to be responsible for
[27:40] all the things that go in with with
[27:42] providing for a home and taking care of
[27:44] that baby you gotta you got to get a
[27:46] crib or you got to get paid for diapers
[27:48] now you got to pay for what however
[27:49] you're going to feed it whether
[27:52] all those things
[27:54] and then you got to be responsible the
[27:55] sisters he said you got to you got to
[27:57] think of them pretty slick walls that's
[27:59] going to have little dirty hand prints
[28:01] all over them your responsibility to
[28:03] keep things clean and tidy so it's your
[28:06] responsibility to keep things clean and
[28:07] tidy and not have a dirty filthy home
[28:10] not have a home where where people are
[28:11] ashamed to come over and fellowship with
[28:13] you
[28:14] i mean he said it
[28:16] i'm not responsible he said it
[28:20] and then you got the responsibility of
[28:22] educating your children you know you
[28:24] begin to think about how how are you
[28:25] going to educate your children now many
[28:27] times you think well i'm going to
[28:28] homeschool my kids well are you equipped
[28:31] to do it are you are you going to do do
[28:33] it are you just going to be kind of lazy
[28:35] are you going to are you going to be one
[28:36] of them homeschool parents that just
[28:38] raises your kids and just said well well
[28:41] you know what let them fend for their
[28:42] self and they grow up and they and they
[28:44] and they graduate high school and they
[28:46] can't hardly read or write
[28:47] now i believe in educating your kids
[28:50] because you know it's a great gift to be
[28:51] able to look into the bible and actually
[28:53] read it for ourselves it's a great gift
[28:55] to be able to know enough abcs and
[28:58] mathematics so you can balance your bank
[29:00] account so i i believe that we have a
[29:03] responsibility that when you when you're
[29:05] schooling your kids
[29:06] you need to be you need to take it
[29:08] seriously enough to be able to raise
[29:10] them up so that one day they can teach
[29:11] their own kids how to do things
[29:14] we your kids grow up knowing barely
[29:17] barely how to read or we educate what
[29:19] about educating them about god it's your
[29:22] responsibility
[29:23] little sisters as the pastor of your
[29:25] home to teach you to gather up your kids
[29:28] around your knees and teach them about
[29:30] god
[29:33] you know honestly sometimes when you
[29:34] come to church we talk things about
[29:36] they're pretty deep
[29:38] but it's your responsibility at home
[29:40] together up around your knees and and
[29:42] talk to them about about these little
[29:44] stories like jonah and tell them about
[29:46] tell them about the little little types
[29:48] and and kind of establish them in the
[29:49] word that's your responsibility
[29:52] but we shark our responsibility so many
[29:54] times like jonah did running away to
[29:57] tarshish
[29:58] he said you got the responsibility of
[30:00] clothing and feeding how will your
[30:02] family be clothed how are you how will
[30:04] your family be clothed what if what if
[30:06] grandma gives your daughters some
[30:08] clothes that they shouldn't be wearing
[30:10] are you going to be like well i'm just
[30:11] going to keep the piece and put the put
[30:13] this dress on her that she don't need to
[30:15] be wearing put these clothes on or are
[30:17] you going to take a stand and face it
[30:20] are you going to take a state what if
[30:21] what what if what if somehow your kids
[30:23] get a hold of some clothes that ain't
[30:25] modest are you just going to let them do
[30:26] it whatever
[30:28] will you let them have their own phone
[30:30] and their own computer and what how you
[30:32] you know things to think about because
[30:34] you're responsible you're responsible
[30:36] for raising your kids and setting a
[30:38] standard in your home and facing the
[30:40] responsibility
[30:43] that's why romans 14 12 says
[30:46] so then every one of us
[30:48] shall give account of himself
[30:50] to god
[30:51] we've all got to give an account now why
[30:53] do we have to give an account because we
[30:55] are responsible now you know you know
[30:58] you think about that so many times we
[30:59] want to blame other people for our
[31:01] predicament whatever but but the bible
[31:03] says
[31:05] you got to give an account of yourself
[31:08] when if if if you were to to to not get
[31:11] things straight here and end up at the
[31:12] white throne judgment you you're you're
[31:15] not going to be standing up there with
[31:16] your pastor next beside you or your your
[31:18] d connects beside you and they're giving
[31:20] an account but you're going to be given
[31:22] the one given an account
[31:24] because everything program said
[31:25] everything is a responsibility and it's
[31:27] so easy when the responsibilities face
[31:29] us to shirk from them we find out that
[31:32] marriage is a responsibility in all
[31:34] matters
[31:35] now going back to marriage now you think
[31:37] about all the things that's wrapped up
[31:38] in a marriage you have a responsibility
[31:41] to love and to be faithful
[31:44] and to provide and marriage may you have
[31:46] a responsibility to love one another so
[31:49] many people in this day and time they
[31:51] enter into into marriage and i i was i
[31:53] was reading this more
[31:55] where i was reading where somebody
[31:57] somebody on the internet was talking
[31:58] about how
[32:00] people just
[32:02] in today's society in modern times they
[32:04] get it in their in their head that if
[32:06] they get married then they can just they
[32:08] go on
[32:09] until they find something better and
[32:11] then they just get divorced and go on
[32:13] with that person
[32:14] but you see when a christian really
[32:16] enters into marriage you're approaching
[32:18] it from the from the standpoint of of
[32:20] love you really love that person and
[32:22] when you love something that's your
[32:24] responsibility with love i'm talking
[32:25] about when you really love somebody
[32:28] you love them through thick and thin and
[32:30] you love them whether or not they're
[32:32] hooked up on a machine at the hospital
[32:34] in a coma you love them you you love
[32:36] that's what love is where you can sit
[32:38] beside somebody and you
[32:40] and they can't even talk back to you
[32:42] with the machine beeping in the hospital
[32:44] but you love them now that's the kind of
[32:46] love that the world don't know nothing
[32:48] about because to them as soon as
[32:50] somebody gets cancer or whatever you
[32:52] read about all these politicians that
[32:54] get their wife gets cancer and the first
[32:55] thing they do is they divorce them and
[32:57] they go off to find somebody else that's
[32:59] not love well they don't know anything
[33:01] about this responsibility that i'm
[33:03] talking about
[33:04] tonight we're talking about shirking
[33:06] responsibilities and brother ram said
[33:08] even many times we find that ministers
[33:10] oh goodness
[33:12] ministers many times shirk a
[33:14] responsibility for standing for the true
[33:17] word of god when they're confronted with
[33:19] it you see what a responsibility we've
[33:21] got
[33:22] we've got a responsibility to preach the
[33:23] word
[33:24] you've got a responsibility to live it
[33:26] you've got a responsibility in your home
[33:28] we've all got areas of our own
[33:29] responsibility he said ministers are
[33:31] assured that responsibility when truth
[33:33] of the word of god is brought face to
[33:35] face faced with with human beings we we
[33:38] are prone to shirk back until the last
[33:40] resource
[33:42] so let's not shirk back from our
[33:43] responsibility
[33:46] you know it's our responsibility as a as
[33:48] a christian when you come into the house
[33:49] of god to give your whole life to god
[33:52] it's your responsibility it's your
[33:54] responsibility
[33:56] as jesus told nicodemus you've got to be
[33:58] born again this is your responsibility
[34:00] to be born again
[34:02] my brother brown told this story about
[34:04] his nephew melvin have y'all ever heard
[34:06] about melvin
[34:08] now now let me before i get into this
[34:10] story
[34:10] mate what you young people how would you
[34:13] feel if we called your name out in
[34:14] service and preached to you like brother
[34:16] branham would preach about people
[34:18] you know
[34:20] he called this brother's name out and
[34:22] talked about he he'd call his his
[34:24] daughter's name out and talk about how
[34:26] overweight she was and things like that
[34:27] have y'all ever heard him say sister
[34:29] rebecca about she's gained a little
[34:30] weight or whatever
[34:33] and and and see see how we we draw up
[34:36] sometimes when the truth is told to us
[34:38] but it's our response god wants you to
[34:40] see sometimes how you'll respond
[34:44] to the responsibility that he wants you
[34:46] to have what are you going to do with it
[34:47] when the truth is presented are you
[34:49] going to bow up and say you can't talk
[34:50] to me like that
[34:52] now brother madam he would say he said i
[34:54] baptized that boy melvin in the name of
[34:57] jesus christ here a few years ago and he
[34:59] got with some little girl and turned
[35:00] catholic
[35:02] and i held his mother's hand while she
[35:03] was dying over there she said to me the
[35:05] last words take care of melvin
[35:08] take care of melvin
[35:10] and now melvin he said melvin has been
[35:12] dreaming dreams
[35:13] now melvin ain't doing right now he he's
[35:16] doing he's
[35:17] he's got on the wrong boat
[35:19] like jonah instead of going to nineveh
[35:22] where the fair has already been paid for
[35:24] him if he'd just get on it he's going to
[35:26] tarshish
[35:27] but he was dreaming dreams he said he's
[35:29] just been dreaming dreams every day the
[35:31] last week he's been dreaming dreams and
[35:33] he said in his dream he said i'd walk
[35:35] into your church uncle bill and you were
[35:38] standing there preaching i'd run up
[35:41] to start to make a confession and i wake
[35:44] up
[35:46] you think about maelva knowing that he's
[35:47] on the wrong boat and he's dreaming that
[35:50] dream about i i i i start i went up to
[35:53] make a confession and i woke up and he
[35:55] said i've been wrong
[35:56] and brother brown told him he said i i
[35:58] said melvin you don't need no
[36:00] interpretation for that
[36:02] your place is down there where you
[36:04] belong
[36:05] that's right see
[36:06] now now maybe tonight we could ask that
[36:08] question do we have any melvins here
[36:10] tonight that are on the wrong boat but
[36:12] you just you just need maybe an
[36:14] invitation to get on the right boat
[36:16] need a reminder that the fare has
[36:18] already been paid to nineveh
[36:21] right you know some sometimes brother
[36:23] ram said sometimes it takes to very hide
[36:25] off of us to face up to our
[36:27] responsibility sometimes you just got to
[36:30] get it laid out in front of you where
[36:32] you can see that you're on the wrong
[36:33] boat and then you can face it takes to
[36:36] hide off of some sometimes don't it it
[36:38] hurts a little bit to be faced with the
[36:40] fact that you're on the wrong boat
[36:42] sometimes it hurts a little bit now
[36:45] people say i know that's right but if i
[36:47] did that that kicked me out of the
[36:49] church
[36:50] thinking about popularity yeah that's
[36:52] what that's what jonah was doing when he
[36:54] he said i i i can't go down to nineveh
[36:56] because i don't know how they'll react
[36:57] to my message thinking about how people
[37:00] are gonna react to what you the life
[37:01] that you live he said what of it if you
[37:04] don't if you don't they're gonna kick
[37:05] you out up there
[37:07] you you got to be kicked out somewhere
[37:09] see it's time to face up to our
[37:12] responsibility
[37:13] and what are we have a responsibility to
[37:15] the truth our responsibility is to the
[37:18] truth what are we going to do when we're
[37:19] presented with the truth
[37:21] you see well what i'm talking about
[37:22] tonight is if you're in melbourne here
[37:24] tonight you might have been in church
[37:25] for five years or 10 years or 20 years
[37:28] paying your tithes and and all the time
[37:30] you've been maybe faking it along the
[37:32] road you you're just here because you're
[37:34] here because your parents are want you
[37:36] to be in church and but but maybe it is
[37:38] time the night to face up to your
[37:40] responsibility and get on the right boat
[37:43] get on the boat to nineveh
[37:46] you don't even have to pay for your fare
[37:48] because jesus paid the fare on calvary
[37:50] he already paid for you
[37:53] [Applause]
[37:56] that's that's what grace is grace is
[37:58] when the fair is already paid all you
[38:01] got to do is walk up to the boatman and
[38:03] say i'm here i'm ready to get on the
[38:05] boat i believe it and just just walk up
[38:08] the plank and say i accept the promise
[38:10] that you've given to me
[38:13] and jesus said search the scriptures for
[38:15] them then you think you have eternal
[38:17] life and they are they that testify of
[38:19] me
[38:20] but we find that people won't face up to
[38:22] that face up to it face up to the fact
[38:25] that get your loss face up to the fact
[38:27] that you need something else face up to
[38:29] the fact that you've been shirking your
[38:31] responsibilities all this time
[38:33] that you've been coming to church acting
[38:35] like a believer but yet there's
[38:36] something lacking in your life maybe
[38:38] tonight it's time to face up to the fact
[38:40] that you ain't been dressing right and
[38:42] living right and walking right and doing
[38:44] what you know is right but it's time to
[38:46] face up to the fact that you're not on
[38:48] the right boat
[38:50] he said being brought into the presence
[38:52] of god you see what jonah was running he
[38:55] was running from the presence of god it
[38:57] said and when you're brought into the
[38:59] presence of god when you're brought into
[39:01] the circle of believers into the
[39:02] sanctuary and you can see god's word
[39:05] being fulfilled and you can see his
[39:07] promises being made manifest and see
[39:09] that god is obligated to that promise
[39:12] and see that when he brings that promise
[39:14] to pass he said then people are afraid
[39:16] to face up to this responsibility of
[39:19] coping with the message of the hour
[39:21] you know what coat means to cope with
[39:24] the message of the hour
[39:25] to cope means to deal with successfully
[39:28] to deal with it
[39:31] people so they have such a hard time
[39:33] just dealing with life
[39:35] but we got to deal with the message when
[39:37] the message when the truth is preached
[39:38] to you when the truth you got to cope
[39:40] with it one way or another
[39:42] that's why he kept he would say you're
[39:44] going to leave when you go out of the
[39:45] doors you're going to leave better or
[39:47] worse you're going you're going to go
[39:49] out of the door i've seen people go out
[39:51] of the out of church doors and they go
[39:54] out cursing and go out saying all kinds
[39:56] of horrible things because listen you
[39:58] can't help it you're gonna go either
[40:00] church doors better or you're gonna go
[40:02] out worse tonight you're gonna go out
[40:04] leaving
[40:05] believing that i need to face up to my
[40:07] responsibilities and believing that
[40:09] there's a god that can meet my need are
[40:11] you going to go out worse it's time to
[40:13] make up your mind and face up to your
[40:15] responsibility whether you're going to
[40:17] take the truth and do something with it
[40:19] or whether you're going to shirk it like
[40:21] jonah was doing
[40:24] every age has had to face up to the
[40:26] truth of the day
[40:28] every ages had to face up to their
[40:30] responsibility
[40:32] how many lutherans brother brown said
[40:34] was afraid to face up to luther's truth
[40:39] to the truth
[40:41] when they would when they might die
[40:43] if if they would believe luther's truth
[40:46] that you're not justified you're not
[40:48] justified because you pay a priest a
[40:50] bunch of money you're not justified
[40:51] because you pre give your priest that
[40:53] last cow that your family has that
[40:55] you're trying to survive off of that
[40:56] you're not justified that and then they
[40:58] would come and kill people because they
[41:00] believe in martin luther's message and
[41:02] so many people in that day would not
[41:03] face up to the truth
[41:05] now face up to that truth
[41:07] and what about all the methodists
[41:08] brother brown talked about how that they
[41:10] were called the methodists were called
[41:12] holy rollers and if you had to face up
[41:14] to the truth of what that was in that
[41:16] day or else you would face all the
[41:18] ridicule of the people of the of the of
[41:20] the big name believer the big name
[41:22] christians in that day
[41:23] he said they had the jerks and and they
[41:26] were considered a bunch of holy rollers
[41:27] but you had your mothers and fathers had
[41:30] to either accept it
[41:31] face up to the truth and facts or turn
[41:33] it down
[41:35] but what about the pentecostals that
[41:37] received the restoration of the gifts
[41:39] when the baptism and the holy ghost come
[41:40] out with speaking in tongues
[41:42] and the gifts of the spirit come into
[41:44] the church and the methodists wanted to
[41:46] kick them out but you had to face up to
[41:48] it it's something that you had to do
[41:51] why because it's your responsibility as
[41:54] a christian you had to face up to it you
[41:56] had to he said you've got a
[41:58] responsibility everybody has and you
[42:00] must face up to these things you got to
[42:03] face what does that mean to face up to
[42:05] it to see it laying there in front of
[42:07] you and you got to face up to what
[42:08] you're going to do with it are you going
[42:10] to believe it are you just going to be
[42:12] halfway in and halfway out christian a
[42:14] lukewarm christian are you going to be
[42:16] completely sold out to god and let him
[42:19] have prediminance in your life
[42:21] are you going to face up to the fact
[42:22] that there's something wrong in your
[42:23] life
[42:25] he said when you see then in this day
[42:27] now when the word of god has made these
[42:28] promises of things that we see happening
[42:31] now that we've got the responsibility to
[42:33] ever to either face up to it or get away
[42:36] from it
[42:37] you just can't stay neutral
[42:39] you can't stay neutral
[42:41] you got to do something about it
[42:43] some move has got to be made
[42:46] you gotta you gotta move toward it
[42:48] now now you see jonah jonah didn't just
[42:50] sit when god told him to go to nineveh
[42:52] he didn't just sit there he made a move
[42:54] to go to tarshish now that wasn't the
[42:56] right move but he made a move you're
[42:58] going to move one way or the other you
[43:00] got to make your decision now now you
[43:02] see there there's got to be a true
[43:04] answer to every question and tonight we
[43:06] come to a lot of what to church maybe
[43:08] with a lot of questions that we're
[43:10] confronted with and maybe it's time to
[43:12] face up to what those questions are
[43:14] brother said when something is
[43:16] confronted if there's a question about
[43:17] it there's got to be an answer so we got
[43:20] to face up to those things it's our
[43:22] responsibility to face up to it maybe
[43:24] our questions tonight are is the message
[43:26] true is the baptism of the holy ghost
[43:28] really for me
[43:30] is it can i be born again is there grace
[43:32] for me in this hour and he said as long
[43:35] as there's a question there's got to be
[43:37] a direct answer somewhere
[43:39] now now direct answer don't mean just
[43:41] somebody's opinion but it means there's
[43:43] something that's right
[43:45] there's something that's true
[43:47] when i if i was going to ask somebody if
[43:49] you were out in the woods hunting or or
[43:51] something that you you say well where's
[43:52] the west there there's west is a
[43:55] coordinate on the map it's a it's a
[43:57] point on the compass
[43:59] if somebody was to tell you well nor
[44:01] west is northwest then after a while
[44:04] you'd get all turned around you realize
[44:06] you weren't going in the right direction
[44:07] and you go hunting for somebody that
[44:09] could tell you where west is in other
[44:12] words there's got to be a truth
[44:14] which way is west there's got to be a
[44:16] truth and there's got to be a truth to
[44:19] every there's got to be a truth to every
[44:21] question when we ask if there's a
[44:22] question in your mind there's got to be
[44:24] a truth
[44:26] now now see that the responsibility that
[44:28] we're talking about tonight is there's a
[44:29] responsibility to find out where the
[44:31] truth is and the truth i believe is in
[44:33] this message
[44:35] like now all these questions that that
[44:37] we've had in the past what is the name
[44:39] of god or how should i be baptized or is
[44:42] god made up three different
[44:43] personalities or is he one personality
[44:45] what does it mean to be born again is
[44:47] there grace for me is there grace for me
[44:49] in this hour to be saved what was the
[44:51] holy ghost given for now you got the
[44:53] holy ghost what's it for that's a
[44:55] question in your mind and the question
[44:56] is in this message that's where that's
[44:58] why we rely so much on what the bible
[45:01] says what the bible teaches because the
[45:03] bible has the answer to every question
[45:05] it's got the answer to the question of
[45:07] life it's got the answer to every
[45:09] question of what your responsibility is
[45:11] in this life
[45:13] now that i'm born again now what's the
[45:15] kingdom of heaven what's the mystery of
[45:16] iniquity what's all these things what
[45:19] what was it eating an apple when you
[45:21] read the book of genesis now listen now
[45:26] think about the grace of god that's been
[45:28] given to us to have an answer to all
[45:30] these questions
[45:31] why did john write about seven churches
[45:33] what are the seven golden candlesticks
[45:35] that john saw who is that seventh angel
[45:37] in revelation 10 that it talks about
[45:39] there's there's got to be an answer to
[45:41] all those questions
[45:42] and the answer cannot be found in any
[45:44] denominational system there's only one
[45:46] place that you can find the answer to
[45:48] all these questions
[45:49] and brother adam said when these
[45:50] questions confront us about the bible
[45:52] truths there's got to be the right
[45:53] answer somewhere that's right it's got
[45:56] to be there
[45:58] there's a common say in that well we
[46:00] just have to i've heard i've heard
[46:01] people say this well we we just have to
[46:03] worship how we feel led we just have to
[46:05] do how we feel led i've heard that so
[46:08] many times lately we just have to do
[46:10] when you when you confront somebody when
[46:12] you put put the truth in front of them
[46:14] well i just have to do how i'm laying no
[46:15] you need to do you need to look into the
[46:17] bible of how you should be doing because
[46:19] what if what if you're being led wrong
[46:22] what if what if you're being led by your
[46:23] own opinions or by what somebody told
[46:25] you but there's a truth there's a true
[46:28] answer to every question there's a right
[46:30] and a wrong there's a truth to whether
[46:32] or not you should be coming to church
[46:33] there's a truth to whether or not you
[46:35] should be whether or not you should be
[46:37] sitting at home just streaming and all
[46:38] those kind of things a truth and god
[46:41] wants us to worship him in truth
[46:43] the truth there's a truth which is why
[46:46] in john chapter 4 when he was talking to
[46:47] that little woman at the well he said
[46:49] the hour cometh and now he is when the
[46:51] true worshiper shall worship the father
[46:53] in spirit and in truth for the father
[46:55] seek us to such to worship him
[46:58] so he said why don't brother i said why
[47:00] don't you take the bible and sit down
[47:02] and face up to it study it study it over
[47:05] just look it over and check it out
[47:06] yourself with the word amen see so many
[47:09] times we end up sympathizing with things
[47:11] and thinking well i think that over
[47:12] there sounds real good or whatever but
[47:14] god wants us to god wants us to get into
[47:17] the truth and get into the into the into
[47:19] the truth of the thing he said when we
[47:21] find these things though we're
[47:22] confronted and come into a meeting and
[47:24] see the power of god moving and doing
[47:26] things and doing supernatural works and
[47:28] see it performed and look in the bible
[47:30] and see that it's promised for this hour
[47:32] then we are confronted with a
[47:34] responsibility
[47:35] to either accept it i mean he said i
[47:39] mean as for ourselves
[47:41] to accept it not not just not just for
[47:43] your neighbor not just for the person
[47:45] sitting on the pew next to you but
[47:47] accept it for yourselves
[47:49] accept it
[47:50] accept it now except that it means to
[47:53] to embrace it as the truth and give
[47:55] yourself to it to become one with it to
[47:58] accept it not not just to look over at
[48:01] it and say well that seems like a pretty
[48:02] good idea
[48:04] and you know that's how many so so many
[48:06] people and and churches today do they'll
[48:08] come into church and they'll sympathize
[48:10] with it and they think it looks real
[48:11] good and i think it's real nice to be
[48:13] able to sit in a church where things are
[48:15] happening and things god the spirit of
[48:17] god is moving
[48:18] he said many people sympathize
[48:21] many people say it's right
[48:23] but that sympathizing sympathize and
[48:25] ain't the thing that you're responsible
[48:27] for
[48:28] you're responsible for accepting the
[48:30] truth
[48:32] you know he gave the example of you know
[48:34] a young man looking at a girl and
[48:36] and he he'd examine her and say well
[48:38] that's a real christian girl and she
[48:40] exhibits all the qualities of a real
[48:42] christian lady that i admire and i'd
[48:44] like to make her my wife and he just
[48:46] sits there and sympathizes with her that
[48:48] that that ain't how that ain't how you'd
[48:50] even do with a natural to just sit there
[48:52] and sympathize with her he said no
[48:53] matter how much i say she's perfect
[48:56] she's exactly right
[48:57] she is a mind until i accept her and the
[49:00] responsibility of her being my wife when
[49:03] you accept her and you put that ring on
[49:05] her finger then you're taking the
[49:07] responsibility on of providing for
[49:10] you're taking on all the things that go
[49:13] into being married to her and that's
[49:15] what accepting is when you accept christ
[49:17] you're taking on all the things that go
[49:19] in with being a christian you're taking
[49:21] on the reproach of being a christian
[49:23] you're taking on on the blessings of
[49:25] being a christian you're taking on the
[49:27] joy of being a christian everything that
[49:29] goes into being a christian you're
[49:31] taking on because you've accepted it
[49:33] you're not just looking at it with
[49:34] sympathy saying well it looks like a
[49:36] good idea
[49:37] he said that's the same thing the
[49:39] message is you might say it's right or
[49:41] this that or the other and say i
[49:43] sympathize with it i believe it's the
[49:45] truth but you've got to accept it and
[49:48] it's got to become a part of you and you
[49:50] are part of it
[49:51] then it's yours
[49:53] you know what sympathize means would
[49:55] just sympathize means to agree with a
[49:57] sentiment or opinion to agree with it
[50:00] that's a good that's a good thought that
[50:01] the preacher was preaching on
[50:03] you see the danger the danger is there
[50:05] you can sympathize with the wrong thing
[50:07] too you you see a lot of times the
[50:09] minister will say well you got to be
[50:11] careful with that person that came into
[50:12] the church the way that they frame that
[50:14] or the words that they use that's not
[50:16] quite accurate and everybody will people
[50:18] will rise up and say well
[50:20] you're being too critical or whatever
[50:22] and the reason is because they're
[50:24] sympathizing with that they begin to
[50:25] sympathize with the wrong thing that's
[50:28] that's why you know
[50:30] brother in one place he said that
[50:32] shepherds are suspicious
[50:34] because shepherds are like shepherds are
[50:36] watching over the sheep to see if wolf
[50:39] is going to come in they're watching
[50:40] over things to see if something's going
[50:42] to encroach so you know sometimes it
[50:45] might pay it might do you good to pay
[50:47] attention when a shepherd says watch out
[50:49] for that over there because it's
[50:51] dangerous to sympathize with the wrong
[50:53] thing
[50:54] it's dangerous to get caught up with the
[50:56] wrong thing and say well i think you're
[50:57] being a little bit too critical or
[50:59] whatever sometimes being a little bit
[51:01] too critical is is is a good thing
[51:04] sometimes it's good because why we're
[51:05] we're after the truth
[51:07] we're responsible for the truth
[51:10] we're not responsible for sympathizing
[51:12] we're responsible for the truth
[51:15] jonah was running from nineveh because
[51:17] he wanted to take the easy route to
[51:19] tarshish
[51:20] and we don't want ships that'll take the
[51:22] easy route
[51:25] jonah didn't want to face up
[51:27] he hated to do that he he thought them
[51:29] gentiles it's hard to tell what they'll
[51:31] do to me but he had to face up to it and
[51:33] we've got to face up to our
[51:35] responsibility to face up to the truth
[51:38] it's easy to take the easy way where
[51:39] everybody can pat you on the back and
[51:41] say you're a good fella and this is so
[51:43] so a certain in the world will look upon
[51:45] you it's easy to go the popular way
[51:47] that goes for ministers that goes for
[51:49] young people everybody it's easy to take
[51:51] that popular way where your your friends
[51:53] can pull you around back behind
[51:55] behind the church or and start telling
[51:57] you all their
[51:59] their their wicked ideas and their
[52:00] wicked plans and their wicked devices
[52:03] it's because you're interested in
[52:04] popularity it's easy to take that that
[52:07] that easy road
[52:09] in matthew chapter six it said take heed
[52:11] that you do not your arms before men
[52:13] want in popularity popularity don't even
[52:16] do your good deeds to parade them out in
[52:18] front of everybody because popularity is
[52:20] a is a minefield he said therefore when
[52:23] they'll do us down
[52:24] do us down almost do not sound a trumpet
[52:26] before the as the hypocrites do in the
[52:28] synagogues and in the streets that they
[52:30] may have glory of man don't do all your
[52:32] good deeds in front of everybody because
[52:34] why because that's the easy way it's
[52:36] easy to get on facebook and post all the
[52:38] good things you know there's a trend
[52:40] lately on facebook or on social media
[52:42] where people when they have a lot of
[52:44] money they'll go out and give a homeless
[52:46] person on the street like a thousand
[52:48] dollars or give them a night in a hotel
[52:51] and and it looks like a good deed
[52:54] but the reason they're doing that is
[52:55] because they got maybe a million people
[52:57] following their channel
[52:59] and they're trying to get money off of
[53:01] that so they're they're parading their
[53:03] good deeds with something good here i'm
[53:05] going to give and the homeless person is
[53:06] weak but thank you for the thousand
[53:08] dollars it's a good thing but they're
[53:10] parading that good deed around it that's
[53:12] exactly what the bible says not to do
[53:15] you parade your good deed out in front
[53:16] of everybody it's what are you what are
[53:18] you really wanting you wanting a pat on
[53:20] the back
[53:21] you're wanting to pat on the back
[53:25] john chapter 12 said nevertheless among
[53:27] the chief rulers also many believed on
[53:29] him but because of the pharisees they
[53:31] did not confess him lest they should be
[53:33] put out of the synagogue for they love
[53:34] the praise of men
[53:36] they love the praise of men more than
[53:38] the praise of god you see what a trap
[53:39] that is when you start looking for the
[53:41] praise of men more than the praise of
[53:42] god and it makes you it'll make you make
[53:44] you preach different it'll make you do
[53:46] act different around other people
[53:48] a preacher that wants to praise a man
[53:50] can't preach the gospel right because
[53:52] the preaching the preaching of the
[53:53] gospel is not designed for you to get
[53:55] pat's on the back
[53:57] it's it's designed to change lives it's
[53:59] not designed for you know brother and
[54:01] would say things he don't about how god
[54:03] won't want mixers you know what a mixer
[54:05] is somebody going around kissing babies
[54:07] and going to park social events and
[54:09] things so that they can get pass on the
[54:11] back but that's not what the ministry
[54:13] you know the gospel is the preaching of
[54:15] the gospel is scalding and hurtful and
[54:18] and straightens you up why because it
[54:20] makes you face up to your responsibility
[54:23] it makes you face up to the things that
[54:24] are lacking in your life
[54:26] we don't want the praise of our prayers
[54:28] or the praise of our friend group or the
[54:30] praise maybe even of your family you
[54:32] know that's where that praise of your
[54:34] family will get you in trouble when
[54:35] you're supposed to be in church but your
[54:37] family's got they schedule that event on
[54:39] sunday and you get all hung up on that
[54:42] because you well i want the praise of my
[54:44] family more than the praise of god and
[54:46] you'd rather go to that event that your
[54:48] church your family has scheduled on
[54:50] sunday because you're not you're putting
[54:52] that above god you'd rather do what your
[54:54] family's doing than what god wants you
[54:56] to do your place is at church on sunday
[54:58] morning your place is at church
[55:03] in romans chapter 3 it says that he's a
[55:05] jew which is one annually and
[55:07] circumcision is that of the heart and
[55:09] the spirit and not in the letter whose
[55:11] praise
[55:12] is not a man amen but god
[55:15] what what kind of a church would we be
[55:17] if we were all seeking the praise of god
[55:19] and not of men we'd get alone in our
[55:21] prayer closet and ask for god's blessing
[55:23] on our life and confirmation that we're
[55:25] walking in the way that he wants us to
[55:26] be to be doing instead of looking to one
[55:29] another for our for our confirmation but
[55:32] he said when you have to do something
[55:33] different when you have to stand to your
[55:35] conviction of what you know to be the
[55:37] truth
[55:38] there is where the hard part is
[55:40] there's where the rub is now he said you
[55:43] take a woman she might not ever be very
[55:45] attractive or whatever she is but you
[55:47] let that woman stand for principles of
[55:49] womanhood
[55:50] let her stand like a lady and if a man's
[55:52] got an ounce of man about him he'll take
[55:55] up for
[55:56] i think that's something that should
[55:57] resonate with all of the sisters in here
[56:00] even even you know we we've got some
[56:03] beautiful sisters in here but even if
[56:05] you're not beautiful what really makes
[56:07] you beautiful is your character the
[56:09] character of somebody that will stand
[56:11] for something true you see
[56:15] you you see a uh you see a a a young
[56:18] lady that's supposed to be a christian
[56:20] but yet she's going out here and and and
[56:22] pants and doing things that she's not
[56:23] supposed to be a real christian man is
[56:26] not going to be looking for that but you
[56:28] see maybe maybe a sister that that she
[56:30] looks she looks like she's going to be a
[56:32] real mother she's going to raise her
[56:34] face she's going to take that
[56:35] responsibility seriously and she's
[56:37] wearing the clothes of she's clothed in
[56:39] righteousness a real christian man is
[56:42] going to be like that's somebody that
[56:43] stands for something that i admire
[56:47] you see ephesians chapter 6 said
[56:48] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[56:51] of god that you may be able to withstand
[56:52] in the evil day and have it done all to
[56:54] stand
[56:56] we're our responsibility is to stand for
[56:58] something and he said stand there for
[57:01] having your loins girl about with truth
[57:03] and having on the breastplate of
[57:04] righteousness god wants to see somebody
[57:07] that stands for him and if you stand for
[57:09] god if you want god for stand for you
[57:11] stand for his word
[57:13] if you're standing for his word when
[57:15] trouble strikes then you can have
[57:16] confidence that he'll stand for you
[57:18] where can i find that in the bible
[57:20] brother bob
[57:21] and the bible says in matthew chapter 10
[57:23] and whosoever therefore shall confess me
[57:25] before me and him will i confess also
[57:28] before my father which is in heaven
[57:30] what's that mean when you confess that
[57:32] lord i believe i'm healed i believe i'm
[57:34] saved i believe when you go to work and
[57:35] you tell somebody the reason why you're
[57:37] acting the way that you do the reason
[57:40] i've told people before at work the
[57:41] reason why i won't drink alcohol when
[57:43] they have their social events you
[57:45] confess you'd make it you make a stand
[57:47] for for something and then god will
[57:50] confess you in heaven
[57:52] he said but whosoever shall deny me
[57:54] before me and him will i also deny
[57:56] before my father which is in heaven
[57:58] think not that i am come to send peace
[58:00] on earth i came not to send peace but a
[58:03] sword amen see that's what that's what a
[58:06] lot of times we we think the christian
[58:08] journey is about that we should all be
[58:10] at peace with with one another when
[58:11] somebody comes in and preaches something
[58:12] that's contrary to the word well we want
[58:14] to be peaceful now we want we don't want
[58:16] to say nothing we just all want to be
[58:18] we just all i believe in being loving
[58:20] and kind and everything listen i believe
[58:22] i believe if you disagree with brother
[58:24] you can throw your arms around them
[58:26] and call them your brother but but that
[58:28] don't mean that i gotta agree with what
[58:30] they say there's a lot of things i don't
[58:32] agree with but yet i call the brothers
[58:34] my brother and i i love them
[58:36] there's there's differences you know
[58:38] some people some people believe we
[58:39] didn't land on the moon some people
[58:41] believe we did land on the moon some
[58:42] people republican some people are
[58:44] democrat but yet we can all put our arms
[58:46] around one another they call us love but
[58:48] yet there's there is a truth there is a
[58:50] truth
[58:51] there is
[58:52] a real west
[58:54] and if you're going northwest or
[58:56] southwest
[58:58] it might be good to find out whether
[59:00] you're really going west or not
[59:03] brother adam said he that will stand for
[59:05] me here i'll stand for him there
[59:07] he that witnesses of me here i witness
[59:09] for him in the presence of god and the
[59:11] holy angels
[59:13] he said decent thinking people will
[59:14] think more of you
[59:16] if you'll stand for your conviction
[59:19] decent thinking people will think more
[59:21] of you now now
[59:23] worldly people won't think more of you
[59:25] because worldly people the devil wants
[59:27] you to not stand for nothing that's why
[59:30] you're a lot of your worldly friends
[59:32] they don't they don't want you to stand
[59:33] for nothing they want you to they want
[59:35] you to keep smoking that marijuana with
[59:37] them and hanging around with them and
[59:39] and talking dirty and using cuss words
[59:42] and looking at women as they walk by
[59:44] they won't they want to hear you say all
[59:45] that stuff but when you start taking a
[59:47] stand for the truth then they won't want
[59:50] to be your friends anymore because
[59:51] they're not concerned about taking a
[59:53] stand
[59:55] but somebody this decent thinking
[59:57] will be concerned about taking a stand
[1:00:01] he said when everybody likes you nobody
[1:00:03] disagree with you do you disagree with
[1:00:05] nobody
[1:00:06] if that that ain't a dishrag you think
[1:00:08] about that now
[1:00:10] disagree with nobody he's saying that's
[1:00:12] a dishrag because there's gonna be
[1:00:14] disagreements
[1:00:16] it's okay to disagree
[1:00:18] you know what disagreeing it actually
[1:00:21] we sharpen one another when there's a
[1:00:23] disagreement and you can talk about it
[1:00:25] now
[1:00:26] if you've got the right spirit about it
[1:00:28] if you got the right spirit you but
[1:00:29] you're going to disagree there there no
[1:00:31] there's nothing wrong with this degree
[1:00:33] so many times some disagreements crop up
[1:00:35] and somebody will say well well you
[1:00:38] we should almost like we shouldn't
[1:00:39] disagree
[1:00:41] we sh the word is what will will hone
[1:00:43] our thinking the word is transforming
[1:00:45] our mind but when somebody across the
[1:00:47] country or whatever disagrees with me
[1:00:49] somebody preaches something different
[1:00:52] i can't help but disagree
[1:00:54] you're going to have a disagreement if
[1:00:56] there's a truth and listen there's going
[1:00:58] to be even more disagreements as it's
[1:00:59] honed down to that razor sharp point at
[1:01:02] the top of this pyramid there's going to
[1:01:04] be disagreements where things begin to
[1:01:06] fall off and you begin to say
[1:01:08] the way that i used to think about that
[1:01:10] is different than the way that i think
[1:01:11] about it now i i can look at just all
[1:01:14] the minister friends that i used to know
[1:01:15] that that that they changed the way that
[1:01:18] they're thinking
[1:01:19] they they preach different now people
[1:01:21] that people they used to side with
[1:01:23] different things and and the word got a
[1:01:25] hold of them and it transformed their
[1:01:27] thinking and they're they're doing
[1:01:28] things different now
[1:01:30] and as they do things different
[1:01:32] you you you're going to have
[1:01:34] disagreements
[1:01:36] he said we have many easy ways to go
[1:01:38] ships going down to tarshish for it's
[1:01:40] easy the unresponsibilities
[1:01:42] it's easy hey you know
[1:01:45] it's like
[1:01:46] he used that example of going down a
[1:01:47] river and and the currents taking you
[1:01:49] one way
[1:01:51] and what we want to do is we want to you
[1:01:53] you're rolling up the river you know and
[1:01:55] what we want to do is we just want to
[1:01:56] let the oars go and just let the river
[1:01:58] the current carry us wherever carry us
[1:02:01] over into the bank of of drinking
[1:02:03] alcohol carry us over to the bank of
[1:02:04] just sitting at home and or whatever
[1:02:06] whatever your your your thing area of
[1:02:09] shirking responsibility is
[1:02:11] carry us over to the bank of laxness and
[1:02:13] carry us over into the bank of not not
[1:02:15] not doing what you're supposed to be
[1:02:17] doing
[1:02:18] but
[1:02:19] because it's hard
[1:02:20] taking responsibility is hard to to row
[1:02:23] against that current and pull that over
[1:02:25] and and and strive and struggle against
[1:02:28] the current of the river
[1:02:30] he said you get your oars and start
[1:02:31] pulling up against the current you don't
[1:02:33] make much time and it goes hard but you
[1:02:35] just want to let loose the oars and
[1:02:37] watch how fast you pass the trees going
[1:02:39] down but look where you're going
[1:02:40] there's a waterfall
[1:02:42] he said when things are floating easier
[1:02:44] remember you're going towards a great
[1:02:45] cataract down there of some sort you're
[1:02:48] going towards the false and it won't be
[1:02:50] long you'll be going over that false
[1:02:52] you see that's why that's what preachers
[1:02:54] are preaching so hard against
[1:02:56] it gets going over the falls we're
[1:02:58] warning the gospel is a warning to you
[1:03:00] that if you're not taking responsibility
[1:03:03] if you're not facing the facts you're
[1:03:05] heading for destruction
[1:03:06] you've got to accept responsibility you
[1:03:09] must accept your responsibility and the
[1:03:11] responsibility that god has given us in
[1:03:13] this day is to bring this message to
[1:03:16] accept this message to do something with
[1:03:18] it he said we must get down to it and
[1:03:20] everywhere we go and tell the message
[1:03:22] and tell the people that jesus christ is
[1:03:24] coming that he's god and he's coming
[1:03:26] soon amen
[1:03:28] why cause you if you got the answer
[1:03:31] if you know which way is a west
[1:03:34] you've got to tell it
[1:03:36] you're under an obligation to tell it
[1:03:38] that's right i i was listening i don't
[1:03:40] know if you know that philosopher he's
[1:03:42] i guess that's the right way to call him
[1:03:43] jordan peterson he's kind of famous
[1:03:45] these days but he that's what he was
[1:03:47] talking about he that if you know the
[1:03:49] truth you're under under obligation to
[1:03:51] proclaim it you have a responsibility to
[1:03:53] tell the truth if you know the truth but
[1:03:56] man is always shirking their
[1:03:57] responsibility just like adam shirked
[1:04:00] his responsibility when adam didn't face
[1:04:02] up there in the garden he had he had a
[1:04:04] responsibility to either like like
[1:04:07] what boat you're gonna get on
[1:04:09] he had the responsibility to either stay
[1:04:11] with eve or get on the boat with god
[1:04:15] that's the responsibility that the test
[1:04:16] that i abraham was presented when he
[1:04:18] when god told him you you either take
[1:04:21] isaac or you take me
[1:04:22] you either sacrifice isaac or you take
[1:04:24] me
[1:04:25] which boat are you going to get on and
[1:04:26] abraham made the right choice i'm going
[1:04:28] to i'm going to lay down everything
[1:04:30] everybody's got something they got to
[1:04:31] lay down in your life are you going to
[1:04:33] take are you going to just go on through
[1:04:35] your life with that thing that you're
[1:04:36] unwilling to lay down are you going to
[1:04:38] face up to it face up to the fact that
[1:04:40] you've got a responsibility to the truth
[1:04:42] to accept it and believe it
[1:04:46] he said think of it god only give them
[1:04:48] adam and eve eight or ten words to keep
[1:04:51] but of that tree thou shalt not eat
[1:04:52] that's all they had to keep and even
[1:04:54] with that much word they broke it
[1:04:59] every man had to face up
[1:05:01] every man has a responsibility for
[1:05:03] before god you've got a responsibility
[1:05:05] you've got a responsibility to go to
[1:05:07] nineveh
[1:05:08] and you've got a responsibility to make
[1:05:10] a move you've got to make a move you've
[1:05:12] got to act you got to you got to step up
[1:05:15] and and believe you got to do something
[1:05:17] he's because brother ryan said faith
[1:05:19] without works is dead the bible says
[1:05:21] faith without works is dead in other
[1:05:23] words if you're just sympathizing with
[1:05:25] it you won't make a move but if there's
[1:05:27] something if you're ready to accept it
[1:05:29] you'll make a move toward that thing he
[1:05:31] said if you say i believe it and don't
[1:05:33] make no act
[1:05:34] just like the message if you say i
[1:05:36] believe it don't make an act what good
[1:05:38] does it do you know what what good would
[1:05:40] it have done if noah just sympathized
[1:05:42] with it when when when god told him you
[1:05:44] need to go build an ark but he didn't
[1:05:46] just sympathize with it he went and got
[1:05:48] his toolbox he went and rounded up all
[1:05:50] his tools and well i i don't know if how
[1:05:53] they would cut wood and everything back
[1:05:54] then all the things that they would use
[1:05:56] but he went and he grabbed his hammer
[1:05:58] and he got to work
[1:06:00] and that's what you do when you really
[1:06:01] accept the truth
[1:06:03] is you go to work you got to do
[1:06:04] something
[1:06:06] when something strikes you and you
[1:06:07] realize you're not in the right place
[1:06:09] you go to grab those oars and you got to
[1:06:11] roll and something's got to happen you
[1:06:13] begin to get desperate in your hour of
[1:06:15] desperation like jonah was down in that
[1:06:17] belly of well something's got to give
[1:06:20] you begin to
[1:06:21] like jonah did i know that if i look
[1:06:23] with faith toward god something's going
[1:06:26] to happen why because faith prompts you
[1:06:28] to act you've got to do something god
[1:06:32] told it god told jonah arise go to
[1:06:34] nineveh that great city and cry against
[1:06:37] it for their wickedness has come before
[1:06:39] me and god wants us to cry he wants to
[1:06:41] cry against the evil of the world he
[1:06:43] wants to cry cry out to your children
[1:06:45] and to your family don't do those things
[1:06:48] don't do those wicked things of the
[1:06:49] world he wants the ministers to cry out
[1:06:51] with the truth because we've got a
[1:06:53] responsibility for the truth amen
[1:06:57] brother said cry out against it there it
[1:07:00] is
[1:07:01] that's the subject cry out against it
[1:07:03] there's the check part
[1:07:05] just go there and tell those fellas
[1:07:08] say i come down to join up with you guys
[1:07:10] you know i believe i'll tell you what
[1:07:12] i'll do
[1:07:12] i've got just a little thing here i
[1:07:14] believe i can bring us all together and
[1:07:15] do this down to the other
[1:07:17] no
[1:07:18] but it was cry out against it
[1:07:20] when you have to cry out against
[1:07:22] something
[1:07:24] he said now he had to cry out against
[1:07:25] everything that was down there no you
[1:07:28] think about jones commission
[1:07:30] to cry out against the city
[1:07:32] they cried against their work
[1:07:34] cry out against their church they cried
[1:07:37] against their prophets
[1:07:38] they cried against their ministers they
[1:07:41] crowd against their priests
[1:07:43] cry against the whole thing
[1:07:45] cry out against you see why this gospel
[1:07:47] is not something where we just pat one
[1:07:49] another on the back and we go along
[1:07:51] trying to make everybody at peace but
[1:07:53] there's it's gonna cause division it's
[1:07:55] going to cause disagreement because we
[1:07:58] when you stand for something you're
[1:08:00] standing for the truth not everybody's
[1:08:02] going to see the truth
[1:08:04] noah cried out against his age and moses
[1:08:06] cried out against it at every junction
[1:08:09] you've got somebody you've got people
[1:08:11] that are continually crying out you got
[1:08:13] ministers continually crying out elijah
[1:08:16] was unpopular in his day because he
[1:08:18] cried out against that age john the
[1:08:20] baptist was unpopular and he got his
[1:08:22] hand chopped off because he was crying
[1:08:24] out for it he was crying out against it
[1:08:26] he was crying out against the way that
[1:08:28] herod was
[1:08:29] the marriage and divorce situation with
[1:08:31] the herod got himself all wrapped up in
[1:08:33] and he began to cry out against it but
[1:08:35] you see they faced right up to it they
[1:08:38] faced up to the challenge of the day
[1:08:40] they faced up to their responsibility
[1:08:42] they never run they stood and they faced
[1:08:44] the facts
[1:08:45] they faced the facts are we willing to
[1:08:48] face the facts of whether our life was
[1:08:50] worthy of the gospel or not or whether
[1:08:52] we're living this message of whether
[1:08:53] we're believing whether we're on the
[1:08:54] right track or not
[1:08:58] and they you gotta you gotta do
[1:09:00] something in amos chapter three verse
[1:09:02] eight it says the lion after lord who
[1:09:04] will not fear the lord god has spoken
[1:09:06] who can prophesy you know what that
[1:09:08] means
[1:09:09] if a lion roars in the jungle
[1:09:10] brotherhood said you it's an automatic
[1:09:12] reaction to go whoa
[1:09:15] if you hear a lion roar
[1:09:17] it automatically causes a reaction
[1:09:20] and when the lord speaks something who
[1:09:23] can help but prophesy
[1:09:25] it's an immediate and instant reaction
[1:09:27] that cannot be helped there's got to be
[1:09:29] somebody something to cry to call out
[1:09:32] and he said when i see god doing
[1:09:34] anything and i see it here in the word
[1:09:35] and he promised it who can hold their
[1:09:37] peace and keep still who can keep still
[1:09:40] when the truth is vindicated to you and
[1:09:41] when the word is preached in the power
[1:09:43] of demonstration who can when you see
[1:09:45] the promises of god being made real when
[1:09:48] you see people in the church being
[1:09:49] filled with the holy ghost when you see
[1:09:51] people in the church dreaming dreams
[1:09:53] that come to pass and signs and wonders
[1:09:55] being fulfilled and living out of
[1:09:57] testimony
[1:09:58] how can you help but stay but do
[1:10:00] something how can you help but have a
[1:10:02] reaction
[1:10:04] but man tries to find a substitute
[1:10:08] like adam and eve in the garden trying
[1:10:09] to find a substitute for substituting
[1:10:11] the fig leaves for the real promise of
[1:10:13] god
[1:10:14] god wants somebody to be real sincere he
[1:10:17] wants somebody to be real sincere and
[1:10:19] face up to the truth face up to the
[1:10:20] facts
[1:10:24] i'm gonna try to wind down here
[1:10:32] now now you think do you think now
[1:10:35] when johnny got on the wrong boat
[1:10:38] everything
[1:10:40] brother ram said god was in everything
[1:10:42] that happened after that
[1:10:43] a storm came up
[1:10:45] now you think now
[1:10:47] those of you that are on the wrong boat
[1:10:49] tonight
[1:10:50] maybe there's a lot of stuff going wrong
[1:10:51] in your life
[1:10:53] maybe there's a lot of things going
[1:10:54] wrong in your life maybe there's been a
[1:10:56] lot of wrong decisions that you made
[1:10:58] that you didn't face up to
[1:10:59] and maybe that was all god moving you
[1:11:02] along to the place that you're in now to
[1:11:04] finally face up to your predicament
[1:11:07] he said he said if you're a true
[1:11:08] christian truly called like jonah was
[1:11:12] god was in all god was in all of those
[1:11:14] things he was in that storm that came up
[1:11:17] he was in the the people calling doing
[1:11:20] the uh trying to find out where where
[1:11:22] the problem was
[1:11:23] he was in that well he created a whale
[1:11:25] that come up from the deep and swallowed
[1:11:27] alone at jonah he was in he was in all
[1:11:30] of those things all of those things were
[1:11:32] moving john into a place where he would
[1:11:34] he would be in the right spot to fully
[1:11:36] trust god and really to get it into a
[1:11:39] place where he could when he got dumped
[1:11:41] out in nineveh he could cry out in the
[1:11:43] right way
[1:11:45] because god wanted that message to be
[1:11:47] declared god knew that somebody had to
[1:11:49] be responsible for crying out that
[1:11:52] message and the only one that could do
[1:11:54] it was jonah
[1:11:55] moses couldn't couldn't have preached
[1:11:57] that message to nineveh
[1:11:59] jeremiah couldn't have preached that
[1:12:00] message to nineveh isaiah couldn't have
[1:12:02] preached that message to nineveh and
[1:12:05] nobody else god doesn't want anybody
[1:12:07] else but you right now he wants you
[1:12:09] you're the one that he's crying out for
[1:12:11] and all of the all those things are
[1:12:13] circumstances in your life god is the
[1:12:15] one that's been moving god has been the
[1:12:17] one molding you to bring you to a place
[1:12:19] you want to what is it it's
[1:12:20] predestination the whole time god
[1:12:22] looking for that predestinated seed mold
[1:12:25] searching and looking for somebody that
[1:12:27] will respond to the truth for the
[1:12:29] responsibility of the hour
[1:12:32] come into the fullness of him brother
[1:12:34] i'm saying
[1:12:35] he said we don't want the popular idea
[1:12:37] we want the truth
[1:12:38] and we don't want to face up to nothing
[1:12:40] but what god has said is the truth
[1:12:43] but be sure that your sins will always
[1:12:45] find you out
[1:12:46] if you're on the if you're in that boat
[1:12:48] sailing away to the cataract selling
[1:12:50] away to the to the falls your sins will
[1:12:52] find you out eventually he said if it
[1:12:54] doesn't here it'll get you at the
[1:12:56] judgment it's going to catch you
[1:12:57] somewhere
[1:12:59] he said come into the fullness of him
[1:13:01] your way is paid to where
[1:13:05] it's paid to nineveh
[1:13:06] your weight is your way is already paid
[1:13:09] that's why i'm preaching tonight your
[1:13:11] way is paid he paid for it on calvary he
[1:13:14] died on the cross so that all you'd have
[1:13:16] to do is accept him it's paid the need
[1:13:18] of a not to tarshish and he said you're
[1:13:20] predestinated there's a ship leaving
[1:13:22] right now on this road so there's only
[1:13:25] one thing to do is get on it and you'll
[1:13:28] never have peace
[1:13:30] till you get on the right boat
[1:13:33] you'll never have peace till you get on
[1:13:35] the right ship listen you'll come to
[1:13:37] church and you'll sit in the
[1:13:38] congregation of the lord and you'll look
[1:13:40] at other people receiving the blessing
[1:13:41] of god and receiving their deliverance
[1:13:44] but you won't have peace you'll sit
[1:13:46] there watching and other people being
[1:13:47] the label to live and overcoming life
[1:13:49] and being able to dress right and walk
[1:13:52] right and talk right and being able to
[1:13:54] be delivered from their depression and
[1:13:56] being able to deliver it from their old
[1:13:58] faults and things but you won't have
[1:14:00] peace because you're on the wrong boat
[1:14:03] and jonah never had peace while he was
[1:14:05] in the wrong boat he never had peace
[1:14:07] till he got dumped over the water
[1:14:10] down in that belly of the whale and
[1:14:12] dumped out in nineveh so he could
[1:14:13] fulfill god's purpose in his life so he
[1:14:16] could fulfill what god wanted him to do
[1:14:19] and there's a purpose that god wants you
[1:14:20] to fulfill if you're not fulfilling that
[1:14:23] now you're not at peace i i wonder
[1:14:25] tonight as the missus musicians come if
[1:14:28] you could just examine yourself examine
[1:14:30] whether or not you're at peace tonight
[1:14:33] down in your soul is there something
[1:14:35] that's crying out recognizing that
[1:14:37] there's something off kilter
[1:14:39] you know
[1:14:41] you know whether there's something wrong
[1:14:43] or right
[1:14:45] you know whether there's something right
[1:14:46] in your heart and if there's not now is
[1:14:48] the time to give up and surrender to god
[1:14:52] brother brown said there's no way of
[1:14:54] getting out of it when god ever takes
[1:14:57] out after you just might as well give up
[1:15:00] and go home
[1:15:01] that's all let's stand to our feet
[1:15:03] you might as well give up
[1:15:05] you might as well surrender
[1:15:08] you might as well just kill up
[1:15:10] because you'll never have peace
[1:15:12] until you do
[1:15:14] that
