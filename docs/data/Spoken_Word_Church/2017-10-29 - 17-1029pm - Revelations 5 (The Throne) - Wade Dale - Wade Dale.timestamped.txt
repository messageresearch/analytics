[13:57] as we sing holy
[14:01] holy holy holy holy holy
[14:11] you are holy holy holy holy holy I
[14:21] wanted to see you around shake
[14:27] somebody's hands they god bless you good
[14:29] to see you today good to be in the house
[14:50] of the Lord and love to be with together
[14:52] with God's people I like that song yeah
[14:55] hello turn it down okay
[14:58] how about now then oh okay good you had
[15:02] to be in the house of the Lord now
[15:03] everybody heard what I said the first
[15:04] time so look at the matter it's a little
[15:07] warm in here so y'all gonna get that
[15:09] sleepy spirit on you so just start
[15:11] praying now that you won't get it in a
[15:14] few minutes so let's turn our Bibles to
[15:17] Revelation chapter 5 we're on the the
[15:20] the chapter of Redemption and heading
[15:25] into the seals but there's a few things
[15:26] that we need to get out of the way
[15:28] number one last Sunday we're talking
[15:29] about being worthy we know Christ was
[15:31] worthy but we must also see that in
[15:34] Christ we are worthy because we have to
[15:37] be able to see the whole plan of
[15:41] redemption not just part plan of
[15:44] redemption the whole full plan of
[15:47] redemption all the way to a body change
[15:48] so and I believe revelations 5 shows us
[15:51] that and today we're going to talk a
[15:53] little bit about the throne because
[15:56] there's a dispensational change in
[16:00] Revelations 5 that you have to see all
[16:03] right there's a dispensational change
[16:05] that we have to come just like we've
[16:07] been talking about coming out of the
[16:08] church ages into the headstone there's a
[16:13] dispensational change well then there
[16:14] must be a people that can take that
[16:17] dispensational change amen because
[16:20] Martin Luther under the Son of God
[16:23] revelation the just shall live
[16:25] by faith that was his revelation God
[16:28] anointed that God quicken that and God
[16:30] gave a group of people the new birth
[16:33] from that but now today we can't take
[16:37] just that and take even take a rapture
[16:40] with that because that is would be the
[16:42] first form or stage of our justification
[16:44] to sanctification of the baptismal Holy
[16:46] Ghost so we have to move up in
[16:48] Revelation we have to come from the what
[16:52] we call baby form justification where
[16:54] your sins are chopped off to the very
[16:56] justification that we're so justified
[16:59] that we were worthy for someone that was
[17:03] eternal to take that book a man because
[17:06] the lamb you know that lamb was eternal
[17:09] because remember he was slain before the
[17:11] foundation of the world he was way back
[17:13] in the mind of God but he had to develop
[17:16] down here in this dimension so he had to
[17:20] come here so we're gonna talk about the
[17:22] throne now I want you to remember today
[17:23] we always know that the throne when we
[17:26] say throne you sell it's the throne of
[17:27] my heart just hang on a minute
[17:29] before we get to that let's talk about a
[17:32] little bit about the throne but let's
[17:34] background some from last week so
[17:36] remember I know Terrance has announced
[17:39] all this on November all the other
[17:42] happenings but remember next Saturday

[18:47] hunt with us brother Joe green and
[18:49] Nathaniel and I'll be actually that
[18:50] Sunday I'll be at brother Michael teak
[18:52] so but we'll hook back up static Sunday
[18:54] night and maybe go hunt a little while
[18:57] so good to be in the house of the Lord
[18:59] let's go revelations five and read that
[19:02] Scripture and let's do a little
[19:03] background and then we'll get started
[19:07] let's bow our heads before me before we
[19:10] read down dear Heavenly Father we pray
[19:13] Lord that we've sang the songs we took
[19:17] up the offering we've done all the
[19:19] peripherals of the things that need to
[19:20] be done for a service to begin now I
[19:23] pray Lord that you would come and and
[19:25] make this service alive by the word of
[19:28] god being spoken
[19:30] let it be quicken let us take it home
[19:34] and let us use it in our everyday life
[19:36] just let it not be a one day affair Lord
[19:38] but let it be a 24/7 affair with you
[19:41] Lord just take this little feeble
[19:45] thought and break it down to the people
[19:47] Lord and it may it help them in in
[19:49] everything every walk in life and
[19:51] everything that they do father I ask you
[19:53] that you forgive us of our sins and
[19:55] bless us and take care of us be with the
[19:58] ones Lord that are on the highways the
[19:59] ones that are sick ones that are not
[20:01] with us today we pray this you'd be with
[20:03] them be with our brother and sisters
[20:05] they travel Lord a little bit later on
[20:07] for a few few days Lord and just be with
[20:10] them and take care of them be with the
[20:13] missionaries in the foreign fields Lord
[20:14] we always think about them give them
[20:16] fruit for their labor father and their
[20:18] work that's to be done Lord I pray this
[20:20] you just take us now and sanctifies for
[20:22] this journey reveal yourself to us today
[20:26] father that's the greatest thing we want
[20:28] is revelation more than anything else
[20:30] Lord thank you for the people here Lord
[20:33] we ask you to bless them take care of us
[20:35] clear our mind so that we can hear from
[20:37] you father in the name of Jesus Christ
[20:38] we ask these things amen revelations 5
[20:42] verse 1 and I saw in the right hand of
[20:44] him that sat on the throne a book
[20:46] written within and on the backside
[20:47] sealed with seven seals and I saw a
[20:50] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[20:51] voice who is worthy
[20:53] to open the book and to loose the seals
[20:54] thereof and no man in heaven nor in
[20:57] earth neither under the earth was able
[20:58] to open the book neither to look thereon
[21:00] and I wept much because no man was found
[21:03] worthy to open and to read the book
[21:05] neither to look thereon and one of the
[21:07] elders saith unto me weep not behold the
[21:10] Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of
[21:12] David hath prevailed to open the book
[21:14] and to loose the seven seals thereof and
[21:17] I beheld and lo in the midst of the
[21:18] throne and of the four beasts and in the
[21:21] midst of the elders stood a lamb as had
[21:23] been slain having seven horns and seven
[21:26] eyes now we may get to that today or
[21:28] that maybe the next section of the seven
[21:30] horns and seven eyes which are the seven
[21:32] spirits of God sent forth and do all the
[21:35] into all their because they must be
[21:36] important or they wouldn't be in the
[21:38] Bible they must be important they're in
[21:40] a position right here in the midst of
[21:42] the throne and the midst of the elders
[21:43] stood a lamb and not not a separate
[21:47] scene the same scene you've got a lamb
[21:51] with seven horns and with seven eyes so
[21:55] it must be a part of the lamb it's not
[21:58] something that John saw somewhere else
[21:59] he saw that attached to the lamb all
[22:02] right and we know that the lamb is
[22:04] covering redemption but we'll get to
[22:06] that in a second he came and took the
[22:07] book out of the right hand of him that
[22:10] sat upon the throne and when he had
[22:12] taken the book the four beasts in four
[22:14] and twenty elders fell down before the
[22:15] Lord having every one of them harps and
[22:17] golden vials full of odours which are
[22:19] the prayers of saints and they sung a
[22:20] new song saying thou art worthy to take
[22:22] the book and to open the seals thereof
[22:24] for thou a slain and has redeemed us to
[22:26] God now look and they sing a new song
[22:30] alright so it's a new song it was
[22:32] something new man it was a new song thou
[22:36] art were not an old song passed over as
[22:38] a new song thou art worthy to take the
[22:42] book and to open the seals for thou was
[22:44] slain and hast hashed that's already
[22:49] half has redeemed us to God by the blood
[22:53] out of every kindred tongue people and
[22:55] nation and have made us now you go from
[22:59] looking at the lamb but now John is
[23:01] bringing it to these people whoever
[23:02] these people are we know they're just
[23:04] abroad
[23:05] Christ we know that and have made us
[23:07] unto our God kings and priests and we
[23:09] shall reign on our over in the original
[23:13] is over the earth you may be seated in
[23:15] the Lord I just blessing to the reading
[23:17] of the word now we come to a time that
[23:20] we want to background just a minute and
[23:22] then we want to look and see what's
[23:26] going on with this throne because if we
[23:28] don't
[23:29] it's like brother Branham said of that
[23:31] and I'm going to use it probably next
[23:32] week but we all should know this that
[23:34] the prophet of God told us that in the
[23:37] church ages we couldn't get all the way
[23:39] out seven sevens is 49 that's the fourth
[23:42] seven Church ages seven sevens is
[23:45] forty-nine the 49th year you had a
[23:48] Jubilee or every seven years you how did
[23:50] you believe and only part could go free
[23:52] not everything could go free but on that
[23:55] Jubilee year the 50 is when everything
[23:58] could go free well seven seven is
[24:00] forty-nine that's your church ages so
[24:02] you're in the forty nine you're not in
[24:04] that 50th Jubilee year not yet done all
[24:08] right
[24:09] now that's what we're looking at in our
[24:12] dispensation we got to get out of the
[24:13] church ages seven seven seven seven
[24:16] seven seven there's got to be an eight
[24:18] there's got to be something that comes
[24:21] over and shifts us out of the sevens
[24:23] into the age you say well last numbers
[24:26] let me just put it plain that it's going
[24:27] to take us from just being born again in
[24:30] our soul to being born again in our body
[24:33] it's gonna work its way and come out
[24:36] brother Bob did a real good job this
[24:38] morning talking about the soul body and
[24:40] their soul spirit in the body and and
[24:43] using the visual part of it was really
[24:45] good I enjoyed that and then down
[24:48] through the church ages that's what
[24:49] happened we had men men of God the seven
[24:53] horns and seven eyes were what the seven
[24:56] spirits are and the eyes were what the
[24:58] seers
[24:58] what the seven churches messengers Paul
[25:02] Iranians Martin Luther all the way down
[25:04] Martin Columba Luther Wesley all the way
[25:07] down to brother Branham we know that
[25:09] that's what the seven spirits of God the
[25:11] seven seers the seven eyes
[25:14] a revelation in each age and brought us
[25:17] to a place and that's what I want us to
[25:18] see is that you and I I was telling them
[25:22] this morning you know we we the voice of
[25:25] the Resurrection must be in the bride
[25:27] but the voice of the Resurrection and I
[25:29] hope you get this right the voice of the
[25:31] Resurrection can't be in a dead person
[25:36] somebody has passed on is not they have
[25:39] look they have they have lived their
[25:42] voice they have lived their time they
[25:45] have lived their revelation a man why
[25:48] did the two angels tell tell the
[25:50] disciples is why seek ye the living
[25:53] among the dead why why why are you
[25:56] coming here to look around because and
[25:59] even we talk about an inheritance you
[26:02] can't there's two things gonna happen
[26:04] when a wills read when the Wills read
[26:08] somebody's got to be dead and somebody's
[26:11] got to be alive
[26:12] amen you don't you know I'm not trying
[26:16] to be morbid but if Jews mother has an
[26:19] inheritance
[26:20] well if June and Amy and rich are all
[26:22] dead how you going to call them to the
[26:26] well how you going to call them the
[26:28] reading of the inheritance
[26:29] they have no inheritance their
[26:31] inheritance has to be passed down to
[26:33] someone that's alive so you and I we we
[26:37] honor all those but like brother Dale we
[26:40] can't keep looking back we can't sure we
[26:43] can go and get something from Paul and
[26:45] Iranians and Martin and Lutheran
[26:47] Columbus on Oral Roberts Billy Graham
[26:51] there's there's things in there Clarence
[26:53] Larkin there's things that they have
[26:55] that are pieces but you and I are not
[26:59] pieces we've got to come to a full body
[27:03] Redemption something they didn't come to
[27:06] because they only had a piece of the
[27:08] picture they only had they only had a
[27:11] small piece
[27:15] but we can take all seven eyes and all
[27:18] seven horns we can take all seven
[27:21] revelations we can take everything and
[27:23] have it put together for us by a prophet
[27:26] in the end time that gave the word to us
[27:29] and I'm going to say this again you know
[27:32] we I can't see how you can have a
[27:34] preacher in another dimension
[27:37] this is a live ministry a loud ministry
[27:41] somebody can stand and look you in the
[27:43] eye they say you're not doing right or
[27:46] you are doing right or you're this or
[27:48] we're doing that there's got to be a
[27:50] live demonstration amen
[27:54] so you and I have got to look at a live
[27:57] demonstration coming from a live group
[27:59] of people but frankly were the deadest
[28:03] people that ever live if you're not dead
[28:08] in Christ you're not alive amen the
[28:12] Bible says watch she's dead while she's
[28:15] living the world out there oh man they
[28:19] think they're so live but even like
[28:22] brother Branham I mean in the 60s look
[28:24] how innocent we think the sixties are
[28:26] compared to now and he sees that woman
[28:29] running through the hallways saying this
[28:30] is life you know with a with a beer
[28:32] bottle or whatever in her hand you know
[28:34] and half her clothes on one out now they
[28:37] have no clothes on you know they're
[28:39] walking through they're doing the same
[28:40] thing this his life will be their dead
[28:45] while they're alive now you and I have
[28:49] to be dead in Christ to be alive in him
[28:53] amen
[28:54] so that's why this revelations five we
[28:56] have to see that that when John and them
[28:59] there's two things brother Branham I
[29:01] don't think I brought it but brother
[29:03] Branham calls it one time a scene then
[29:07] he calls it a vision all right so we got
[29:10] to know one thing's for sure that when
[29:12] John was caught up in Revelations four
[29:14] we'll get to this in a minute but he
[29:16] caught up in Revelations for one he sees
[29:19] one on the throne so we what we've got
[29:22] to do with this revelation is four and
[29:24] five we got to unscramble this scene of
[29:28] the
[29:28] these different people lamb lion one on
[29:32] the throne one hand in a book tour one
[29:35] group taking a book from another person
[29:38] but it's not another person it's the
[29:41] same person doing the dispensational
[29:45] work hey man
[29:47] cuz remember that's what struck me and
[29:50] we'll read it very last of this going
[29:51] into the first seal you must see and
[29:55] have the revelation that's why the
[29:57] prophet of God had to line everything up
[30:00] you can't open the seals with a father
[30:04] son Holy Ghost doctrine you can't open
[30:07] the seals with a Trinitarian doctrine
[30:10] God won't allow that
[30:13] because thy brother Nell and I were
[30:15] talking the other day and you can take
[30:16] this any way you want to take it but
[30:18] there's one thing for sure this day of
[30:20] of will preacher with you believe it
[30:22] this way that's fine and I believe it
[30:24] this way that's fine and whatever you
[30:27] think and what that's gone listen Jesus
[30:30] never walked up to the Pharisees and
[30:32] said now you've got a doctrine it's okay
[30:35] no hello now hey he didn't come up and
[30:38] he go well now he didn't even a
[30:41] significant Dimas you're the greatest
[30:44] teacher of Israel and you don't even
[30:46] know what I'm talking about
[30:48] now Nicodemus have a good revelation I'm
[30:51] sure of what he had right but jesus
[30:57] never compromised on anybody else's
[30:59] doctrine listen
[31:03] John's doctrine was good for a while Bob
[31:09] read it this morning kind of struck
[31:10] something in my heart - to bring another
[31:12] message but remember when let's take the
[31:15] type's now when John goes off the scene
[31:19] he's the Elijah number three right when
[31:23] John the Baptist dies and goes off the
[31:25] scene who comes on the scene Christ the
[31:29] head comes on the scene the fullness of
[31:32] the Godhead bodily I told you I got
[31:33] something on there the fullness of the
[31:35] Godhead bodily comes on the scene hey
[31:37] man
[31:39] now you go over in the book of Acts
[31:41] where the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[31:43] comes into the group of people many
[31:45] membered body not one the many members
[31:48] by the 120 the 3000 now you keep reading
[31:51] in the book of Acts Paul finds a group
[31:58] they're still believing in John the
[32:01] Baptist John's gone John is not alive
[32:10] but he meets a Paula who is preaching
[32:14] what Jesus Christ but they were
[32:17] disciples of John the Baptist then they
[32:20] met the ones in Ephesus that what what
[32:23] we know we were baptized under John
[32:27] they're all going back look that same
[32:30] spirits here today the prophet of God
[32:33] introduced us to Christ quit looking
[32:35] back he's gone his voice lives on but
[32:40] the voice of the resurrection will not
[32:43] come out of his mouth it'll come from
[32:46] the mouth of the bride hey man
[32:50] we weren't know squat if he didn't come
[32:55] but he's coming brother's message are we
[32:58] so enamored at John the Baptist until
[33:01] we're still holding his doctrine years
[33:03] after John's already dead no Christ eat
[33:08] what crap Christ do Paul come on people
[33:11] Christ food Paul said have you received
[33:15] the Holy Ghost since you believe believe
[33:18] who John's message I believe John's
[33:22] message but John's message in its
[33:28] written form will not ever save one
[33:31] person but you get the person John was
[33:35] talking about I'm talking about John I'm
[33:37] talking about the lives of the day you
[33:39] get that person inside of you that's why
[33:43] there's only one kinsman redeemer we'll
[33:45] read it in a minute there's only one man
[33:48] could give his life and then take his
[33:50] life and come inside of you kill you and
[33:53] he'd be alive in you now CF revelations
[33:58] 5 because when he took that book he
[34:01] didn't have a problem he didn't stop and
[34:02] go well never when I talked about was
[34:07] that right when I talked about no he
[34:11] took the book because he was worthy like
[34:15] Bob said his flus were not stopped up
[34:17] when outlook our flus are stopped up but
[34:21] I'm gonna tell you something one day a
[34:22] man little hook-nosed Jew named Paul
[34:24] walked up one day and he said you will
[34:26] be judged by what I say now listen if
[34:31] we're to be judged by what he said he
[34:36] must have preached a perfect message cuz
[34:40] you can't judge somebody from an
[34:41] imperfect message hey man come on it's
[34:46] time there is a perfect message and we
[34:50] must get under that what about Paul he
[34:56] comes down he says you be judged by my
[34:58] gospel who do you think you are Paul
[35:02] says I don't know who you think you are
[35:04] but I know the Lamb
[35:06] I was once lost I was once the man that
[35:10] put all of you in prison
[35:12] think about it the great Paul Apollo's
[35:17] I'm not Anna nice he questioned God
[35:23] right cuz cuz God visits Hannah nice in
[35:27] a vision and sense this was a man coming
[35:30] down here and said his name Saul and
[35:35] then I said his flesh and in his spirit
[35:39] now so not but he was like this guy's
[35:43] killing us this guy if I let him in my
[35:47] house he may not kill me but my friends
[35:50] will probably kill me go this guy's
[35:53] putting us in prison but you know what
[35:55] God said God said fear not in us because
[35:57] I'm sending him to you
[36:00] Paul didn't just wander through the
[36:02] streets no he said I'm sending him to
[36:04] you because remember the seed life has
[36:08] to come through the body
[36:09] Paul see that's why I said but these
[36:12] people think he always was eternal if
[36:14] Paul always was eternal why didn't that
[36:16] light when they struck him down on the
[36:17] road to Damascus why did he go have to
[36:19] see him not to get the scales off his
[36:22] eyes widened the Bible say he had to go
[36:24] be prayed for by Annalise lay down hands
[36:26] to receive the Holy Ghost
[36:27] why because anna and i said received the
[36:29] baptism of the holy ghost and paul had
[36:31] not but remember though when it happened
[36:35] though paul had to work now that word
[36:37] was already in Paul's life he just was
[36:41] using it wrong same way with you and I
[36:44] you and I have a gift and the gift that
[36:45] we use we used it wrong but when God
[36:48] gets the hold of you in tears that old
[36:50] part out and puts his self in then he
[36:52] takes that same thing and uses that
[36:58] don't remember brother Ronnie had born a
[37:00] prophet if Paul was a prophet he was
[37:03] born a prophet no that's not even in my
[37:10] notes that one's free I'm gonna charge
[37:11] you for that one
[37:12] not all right but there's a perfect
[37:15] message the prophets message is a
[37:18] perfect message amen now listen what are
[37:24] you gonna do though when you say well I
[37:26] don't need anything but the Prophet okay
[37:30] I don't need anything listen Jesus
[37:33] walked up one day and he had a whole big
[37:35] crowd of people he said unless you eat
[37:38] my flesh and drink my blood you'll have
[37:43] no part with me
[37:44] let's sing take the name of Jesus with
[37:46] you and go home that's what he did cuz
[37:50] remember he spoke his sermon he left he
[37:53] never stood up there and expounded and
[37:54] explained so here we are reading the
[37:59] Bible now it's in your Bible to eat his
[38:02] flesh and drink his blood now if we
[38:04] didn't have somebody to break that down
[38:06] and interpret that
[38:11] John the Baptist didn't do it because he
[38:13] was already dead
[38:15] he took a messenger a preacher to break
[38:22] it down and say Oh eat my flesh we take
[38:28] the wafer we take the communion wine and
[38:33] in symbolic because he said unless you
[38:36] eat the flesh of the Son of Man he said
[38:38] you don't have no part with me right hey
[38:39] he said you're not even got what eat the
[38:42] body words and here william branham
[38:43] comes up he said we're feeding on the
[38:46] body word of the Son of Man bringing it
[38:50] and telling us exactly what Jesus was
[38:52] saying oh we're blind as a bat if we
[38:58] don't have somebody to tell us we're a
[39:02] bunch of sheep when no shepherd hey man
[39:05] how many of you have seen a dead
[39:07] Shepherd lead sheep and I ain't talking
[39:11] about sometimes dead as far as I've
[39:14] known about dead while they're living
[39:17] hey you take a false doctrine and you
[39:19] lead sheep with it
[39:21] brother Brown said false doctrine brings
[39:24] false birth so but what are they doing
[39:27] poor old sheep are still sheep they're
[39:30] being led but in Revelations 5 we'll get
[39:34] to that in just a minute
[39:35] we see that the lamb had no problem
[39:38] taking the book and whatever was in the
[39:42] book must have come to a position that's
[39:45] why I say revelations 5 to me covers to
[39:47] everything because when he takes that
[39:50] book and comes and sits down on the
[39:53] throne we're gonna read it where he
[39:54] comes and sits down on the throne and he
[39:57] start soaking in the seals someone
[39:59] during this time has got to come to a
[40:02] body change because for us to be kings
[40:06] and priests and rain on the earth that
[40:08] group of people in revelations chapter
[40:10] 10 are standing there in a glorified
[40:15] body so we went from revelations 5 where
[40:19] he took the book open it and showed us
[40:22] the complete plan of redemption we'll
[40:24] read there
[40:25] right here cuz look let's go to number
[40:30] one I get started in a minute the breach
[40:37] it is hard up here brother this is the
[40:41] most sublime thing in the scripture he
[40:44] calls it an act that not an angel not
[40:47] nothing could do it now we know that the
[40:49] lamb took a book all right from the one
[40:53] that was sitting on the throne said that
[40:54] was one on the throne then there was one
[41:00] that comes around and takes the book
[41:02] from the one that was sitting on the
[41:03] throne all right so now remember that
[41:06] we're gonna read these a couple from
[41:09] last Sunday number two
[41:10] thank you brother Aaron and you can if
[41:16] some of y'all get cold you can just
[41:17] start shouting and run around the
[41:18] building that won't bother me one bit
[41:22] it won't I'll think I'm in another
[41:27] Church but and while I'm at it since I
[41:34] told you to listen to brother runs
[41:36] Sunday school the other day which you
[41:38] should have enjoyed brother Bob did a
[41:40] matchless piece today too so you you
[41:43] should be listening to these cuz look
[41:44] let me let me just tell you something
[41:48] there's 85 to 92 sometimes a hundred
[41:52] people in this building right plus the
[41:55] people listened on Internet's more now
[41:57] now when brother Dale tells us to go
[41:59] back and watch his sermon and I keep
[42:01] watching it and there's only 30 hit 30
[42:03] views 20 views 25 views I look on Reines
[42:07] and there's 22 views some of y'all ain't
[42:09] doing what nobody tells you to do and I
[42:13] can see it because if we go to youtube
[42:15] it tells you how many views you get okay
[42:19] anyway anyway yeah I can't hide from God
[42:21] YouTube will prove that
[42:25] YouTube so anyway you know that did you
[42:34] I know I know some of the tech-savvy
[42:38] guys there but I know most of you didn't
[42:40] know that you know you can watch that
[42:41] thing you can see every time somebody
[42:43] pulls it up yeah anyway alright number
[42:46] two
[42:46] that's that secret thing we give out
[42:49] this is not written in the word it's
[42:54] sealed on the back of the word the book
[42:56] was sealed by these seven seals now this
[42:57] is just background but watch the whole
[42:59] mystery of the book is sealed up in
[43:01] these seven seals
[43:02] now what look you say well the book
[43:04] survival but that book he's talking
[43:07] about you that's you that's the book of
[43:12] redemption now if you're in the book
[43:14] then you're already considered in
[43:16] Redemption so you're redeemable but
[43:19] remember only the ones considered are in
[43:25] that book that's not the foolish version
[43:28] that's not the cup of water in my name
[43:30] but I was thinking his brother Dale was
[43:32] speaking today that was way that the way
[43:33] that God would have come the way that
[43:36] God would have come there really
[43:38] wouldn't have been a Bible if there
[43:40] hadn't been a fall they really wouldn't
[43:42] have been a Bible so it would have just
[43:43] been us and what would we be talking
[43:46] about because we couldn't glorify the
[43:48] Father because he just made us but he
[43:51] made us with a choice and the choice
[43:53] gives you that godlike quality if you
[43:56] didn't catch that this morning will
[43:57] preach a little bit now that godlike
[43:58] quality is that's why the Bible says ye
[44:01] are God's you know what a God can do a
[44:04] God can change things now God is
[44:07] unchangeable that big g.od he's
[44:09] unchangeable but the reason he's
[44:12] unchangeable is he's already stole what
[44:14] was gonna happen I'm nipa tenth
[44:17] omniscient omnipresent you understand
[44:19] all those words but if he would have
[44:21] just come and we would have just come
[44:23] that way they'd been no we couldn't say
[44:25] it we wouldn't need to be dumb we
[44:26] wouldn't be preaching preach to what
[44:29] we're preaching to redeem us
[44:33] if we don't need to be renamed you see
[44:38] what I'm saying I've said it many times
[44:40] before this is the only way God could
[44:42] absolutely explain itself the way he
[44:46] wanted to be explained or he would have
[44:50] explained it I never won that's just
[44:54] real simple because a God goes God
[44:56] Almighty knew everything just think
[45:03] about if we were infinite see we can
[45:08] because we go to a certain place and we
[45:09] stop we go to a certain place and we
[45:12] stop but God's infinite he knows sister
[45:15] journey what you gonna do tomorrow next
[45:16] day next day next day next day now you
[45:18] don't I don't we have to wait till what
[45:20] happens but remember that doesn't take
[45:23] away her free moral agency her free
[45:25] moral agency is what she decides to do
[45:30] amen
[45:31] now what we're done though is we're
[45:33] influenced by God sure because God is
[45:37] gonna have his will here we go back to
[45:40] the will in the Testament he's gonna
[45:42] have his will because brother Graham
[45:43] said he'll take what permissive will and
[45:46] work it to its perfect well but now
[45:48] watch his perfect well as well as his
[45:50] life as well as his word so we must look
[45:53] into his word and it's the perfect word
[45:57] you say what he needs to change now who
[45:59] are you to tell God to change something
[46:01] yeah who are you to tell God come on you
[46:04] know when I when I was first Saved there
[46:06] in 97 99 thought God why why did I waste
[46:08] so much time why he said don't question
[46:12] I got in other words I got what I needed
[46:16] I got what I needed from you that's the
[46:20] way I wanted you to come or you'd be
[46:22] somebody else that's right so you are
[46:26] special God watched you all the way down
[46:29] you said like so many people they they
[46:32] are you limiting guarding in you become
[46:35] an unbeliever with God why what he said
[46:38] that what Gabriel tell marry with God
[46:42] all things are possible
[46:44] heavenly days woman why are you standing
[46:47] here down with God all things are
[46:50] possible how can a woman not know a man
[46:53] and we'll see she leaned to the carnal
[46:56] mind but remember it worked its way
[47:00] around to the perfect will of God when
[47:02] she caught that and said being unto me
[47:04] according to thy word when he said that
[47:06] the whole mystery of the book is sealed
[47:08] in these seven seals this is one of the
[47:10] most greatest chapters in the whole book
[47:12] of Revelation now taking all into
[47:15] account revelations 5 because remember
[47:18] that's that breach that's that gap or
[47:20] that's that canal that were that we come
[47:22] up to the church ages and we're hitting
[47:24] up against it like this even brother
[47:26] Branham was hitting up against it like
[47:28] this as of yet now mylan come forward
[47:30] and not being made known God I preached
[47:32] everything that you told me to preach
[47:34] yeah I'm I'm paraphrasing but but
[47:36] there's something here
[47:38] he said as of yet Malachi 4 is not being
[47:41] made manifest well then brother Brown
[47:42] knew then they was a further month of
[47:44] his month of his ministry hey man not in
[47:47] the years of preparation bringing all
[47:48] these quotes but not in the years of
[47:50] preparations but when he begins to sound
[47:52] his message amen this is one of the
[47:57] greatest chapters in the whole Book of
[47:58] Revelations alright let's go to number
[48:00] three we've already read these but we'll
[48:01] read them through real quick to get to
[48:04] our point this is the breeks now strong
[48:07] angel diverse to the strong angel with
[48:09] allow boys proclaimed who is worried
[48:10] this will work so much less Sunday
[48:11] worthy for what who is worthy to take
[48:15] that book now we find that where's the
[48:17] book out now to its original owner now
[48:20] whose original owner God Almighty the
[48:22] creator the one that was standing before
[48:24] time is that right standing before time
[48:30] with Adam and Eve Saint man one man
[48:34] standing before Adam and Eve before the
[48:37] fall that's the original owner because
[48:43] he was giving it to Adam right he was
[48:46] giving it to Adam but he had to what he
[48:49] had to take it back because it was
[48:51] forfeited by Adam Adam couldn't continue
[48:54] the plan because Adam was
[48:57] our redeemer he didn't have the title of
[49:00] Redeemer I don't mean to be in your way
[49:02] sorry
[49:03] I think Richard Marlowe he's the only
[49:07] one bless his heart I'm missing he's the
[49:10] only one that could take that and put
[49:14] stripes and dots and solids and make
[49:18] that tie work I can't do it I look down
[49:21] and go how in the world but I wore I
[49:23] wore solid so I could wear this type of
[49:24] this sister Oh Marlo gave me a bunch of
[49:28] ties so I sure do appreciate that he's
[49:32] waiting on us folks I'm telling you we
[49:36] we have got that's what our problem is
[49:39] I'm gonna say this I'll charge you for
[49:42] this and either when somebody goes away
[49:44] we just kind of forget brother Gary all
[49:49] the time I'm not gonna name them all and
[49:51] I'm not trying to rehash and make
[49:52] everybody start booing and crying don't
[49:54] do that they're in a way better place
[49:56] and wheel that's our that's our problem
[49:59] but remember they're over there waiting
[50:04] on us because they're not complete but
[50:10] oh people we got to come to a perfection
[50:12] here to bring them here the prophet of
[50:17] God said all I saw over there was
[50:19] perfection well how are you standing in
[50:21] perfection and willing to come back to
[50:23] this corruption no this corruption will
[50:29] put on in corruption right here in this
[50:31] dimension by what by the preaching of a
[50:35] live word let Bob said there has to be
[50:39] power behind this work where's the book
[50:47] at now to its original owner because
[50:50] it's been forfeited by son the first son
[50:53] of God and in human race and when he
[50:55] forfeit his right to listen to Satan he
[50:57] give up what did he do he accepted
[50:59] Satan's wisdom instead of God's Word so
[51:02] what happened God had to take that book
[51:04] back the book that had our names all
[51:07] written in them revelations 13 8 all
[51:11] will be what deceived except the ones
[51:14] that had their put had their name put on
[51:16] the book of the life of the Lamb before
[51:19] the foundation of the world
[51:21] amen listen we can't lose we just got
[51:28] some battles look we gotta go through
[51:29] amen
[51:31] but the war's already won the war is won
[51:34] all right when he forfeit his right to
[51:37] listen to Satan now number four this is
[51:40] one I like because then John started to
[51:42] weep what happened he's seen there stood
[51:44] the book now how the book stand now I
[51:49] want you to look now we've got one hold
[51:52] hold on a minute I was gonna try to draw
[51:54] this but you just gonna have to get it
[51:56] by revelation there's one sitting on a
[51:58] throne there's a lamb and even the book
[52:04] that the man on the Thrones got is
[52:06] standing up he said there stood the book
[52:12] so in other words there stood the book
[52:16] so wouldn't you think that maybe the
[52:18] lamb and the book is the same person
[52:24] maybe we'll get something here there it
[52:27] was but who was worthy well there stood
[52:29] Gaber of course he was worthy but see he
[52:32] wasn't a man he was an angel see Gabriel
[52:36] didn't have any sin but he'd never been
[52:39] a human and when we fell we fell in
[52:42] humanity we didn't fall well I say Adam
[52:46] Adam didn't fall in soul he fell in his
[52:48] flash he fell in what his spiritual
[52:50] being
[52:51] right so what God had to come back
[52:54] through the same way yep if we fell this
[52:57] way and God being consistent and
[52:59] constant he had to come back to the same
[53:02] way there stood Michael boy you think
[53:04] Michael man he could take that book well
[53:06] you know what wait a minute who's
[53:08] Michael
[53:10] well there's another person standing
[53:13] over here
[53:13] here's Christ's brother Brad said
[53:16] Michael was Christ
[53:17] here's Christ here's one sitting on the
[53:20] throne here's one standing in front of
[53:22] the throne and the one that's got the
[53:23] book in his hand the book standing right
[53:25] here this scene is getting full but I
[53:30] want to tell you I'm gonna try to get
[53:31] that last quote where brother Brown I'll
[53:33] read it if I don't have time or not
[53:35] we're gonna read that last quote I found
[53:36] so it had to be somebody that became a
[53:39] what earthly person like we did and then
[53:43] when he seen this lamb that had been
[53:45] slain from the foundation of the world
[53:46] come up and he seemed that he had been
[53:48] slaying all the way to the foundation of
[53:50] the world then John Webb amen because
[53:52] there it was he saw the whole thing
[53:56] number five real quick the angels call
[53:58] was to call for a kinsman redeemer to
[54:01] appear God said I have a law kinsman
[54:03] redeemer can be a substitute now if you
[54:05] want to find that if you look in your
[54:06] Bibles it's in the Book of Leviticus 26
[54:09] or somewhere in there where he lays out
[54:12] that it must be kin and it must be this
[54:13] must be that because remember what Boaz
[54:16] was doing he was just doing what the law
[54:18] was telling him to do right the law of
[54:21] redemption or the law of kinsman
[54:22] redeemer it came from Adam all the way
[54:24] down through all the apostles and the
[54:26] prophets everything else and nobody was
[54:28] found now what about that nobody in
[54:31] heaven nobody on earth nobody that ever
[54:32] lived
[54:33] Elisha was standing there Moses was
[54:36] standing there all the apostles were
[54:38] standing there of all the ones that had
[54:40] died all the holy men Joab and the sages
[54:43] everyone was standing there and nobody
[54:45] was worthy even to look at the book let
[54:47] alone take it and break the seals Wow
[54:51] look how powerful this seems becoming
[54:53] number six Revelation chapter 5 1961 as
[54:58] soon as he advertised who is worthy he
[55:00] was advertising the coming of the
[55:02] kinsman redeemer and here he stood a
[55:04] lamb and what did he do walked over to
[55:08] the throne where the Spirit of wait a
[55:11] minute I thought the Spirit of God was
[55:12] in the lamb you see what I'm saying how
[55:18] that it is kind of easy that if you read
[55:21] the Bible in a certain way you could see
[55:23] a Trinitarian
[55:24] because you got people standing
[55:26] everywhere but without the alignment of
[55:30] the profit bringing the word down the
[55:32] way it's supposed to be brought down
[55:33] knowing that these are just exactly like
[55:36] brother Dale I mean it's so simple
[55:38] though it's profound they see something
[55:40] else but you take me as a as a human
[55:43] person to my wife I'm a husband I
[55:48] fulfill all that characteristic but now
[55:52] if Josh walks up
[55:53] that's my son so I become a father all
[55:56] right a father figure I become a father
[55:58] to my grandbaby when dear went now when
[56:02] Jim and I are together
[56:03] I'm not saying about grandbaby right
[56:07] that's my wife but when grandbaby comes
[56:10] I don't pull this skin off and put a new
[56:13] one on no I changed my characteristic
[56:16] that I can play with my grandchild be
[56:18] happy with her do like brother Homer
[56:20] says I like my grandchildren two ways
[56:22] coming and leaving now see I don't like
[56:26] Jim that way I like her to stay but my
[56:28] grandkids I can only take a few days
[56:30] then they're gone and that's the truth
[56:34] why cuz you're Doty old granddaddy you
[56:37] change your characteristic and you are
[56:38] totally out of character to what you
[56:40] would be to your children you see it the
[56:43] same way with God there's God standing
[56:45] that one person and look at all these
[56:47] acts that he's playing if they haven't
[56:49] gotta be at three places at one time how
[56:51] can God be preaching in Africa right now
[56:54] and preaching here a little bit have you
[57:00] gotta be saving somebody in Russia
[57:03] that's the Holy Ghost right and then
[57:06] Holy Ghost is here today in you right
[57:08] okay God can be anywhere he wants to be
[57:12] but he's only one walk go to the throne
[57:16] with the Spirit of God was that now look
[57:18] that's a scene so he had to walk over
[57:20] and take the book out of the right hand
[57:22] him him that said upon the throne and
[57:24] all the elders fell down and said thou
[57:26] art worthy because thou was slain why he
[57:30] paid the price of redemption and then he
[57:34] became then his book or at least the
[57:36] book of read em
[57:37] or the book of intercession in the
[57:39] church age was finished now he becomes
[57:46] the Redeemer now just like I told you
[57:50] last Sunday now what we have to do is
[57:51] it's when we go to Revelation six
[57:54] it shows how that he did it
[57:57] revelations five is pretty much a
[58:00] commentary of what he did took the book
[58:04] sat down on the throne opened the seals
[58:06] we started screaming we got a body
[58:08] change now what brother I'm saying now
[58:10] the revealing of how he did it it's
[58:13] gonna be in these seven seals so you got
[58:16] to go to Revelation six we got to get
[58:18] revelations five right remember we got
[58:20] to get the baby turn the right way in
[58:21] the cloud we got it we don't we don't
[58:24] need a breech birth and remember also
[58:26] that word breech means to what to
[58:28] breakthrough if you have a breach of
[58:30] security someone has what went through
[58:33] your security plan and breached that
[58:36] security what and took a step into a
[58:39] place that got it if I understand that
[58:44] so that is the blood is the breach this
[58:46] this this the BRE ACH all right so it's
[58:50] a breach between the church Hades in the
[58:52] sealed something had to breach and pull
[58:55] us together but also there was a breach
[58:58] birth because we were sitting in the
[58:59] church a Jesus being birth go to church
[59:02] hey nothing wrong with that living the
[59:05] Word of God but they all died they all
[59:09] died the mentality is I'll fly away when
[59:14] I die hallelujah by and by right
[59:18] that was their revelation though sure
[59:21] I'm sure they read well when the when
[59:24] the we which are alive and remain I'm
[59:26] sure that scriptures been read a
[59:27] thousand times through the ages but it's
[59:29] never been placed and clicking it's
[59:33] never been placed it's got to be placed
[59:35] it's always been the cow and the tree
[59:37] and the grass but it's always been in
[59:40] the church ages the cow in the tree and
[59:42] the grass down here and the cows in his
[59:44] wrong place amen but he took it what a
[59:47] masterbuilder he took a prophet
[59:50] to bring the cow down not bringing a
[59:52] different cow I didn't on calling the
[59:55] Word of God a cow but you bring his
[59:57] knees taking the Word of God that's
[59:58] already there and he's bringing it down
[1:00:01] where there folks were supposed to be
[1:00:02] all right man
[1:00:04] now the revealing of how he did it is
[1:00:06] going to be in these seven seals now we
[1:00:08] know that it's like when the book of the
[1:00:10] me tutorial work of him was done the
[1:00:12] work was finished now in the first three
[1:00:14] chapters of the church finished but now
[1:00:17] Redemption Redemption is to be revealed
[1:00:20] now now listen brother Branham wasn't
[1:00:24] there redemption in the church ages sure
[1:00:28] right
[1:00:30] to him that overcometh will I give to
[1:00:33] him that overcometh will I give to him
[1:00:35] the over count seven over comings to the
[1:00:37] church ages but that didn't get them all
[1:00:40] the way out
[1:00:41] so as redemption is to be revealed it
[1:00:44] must be something that man has never
[1:00:46] seen before
[1:00:48] [Music]
[1:00:50] read it all of our life read it all
[1:00:53] their life let's see number six
[1:00:58] well we're that number six that's number
[1:01:02] set let's go to number seven we're good
[1:01:04] there buddy all right saying man this
[1:01:07] okay well they got a few things I want
[1:01:09] to bring here before we number seven now
[1:01:17] and he saw one sitting upon the throne
[1:01:19] with the book in his hand his right hand
[1:01:20] think of it now he's in the breech now
[1:01:23] then in this book was the title deed to
[1:01:25] Redemption
[1:01:25] and it will see what seven seals now
[1:01:28] look that book has got to be people
[1:01:37] names of people that are redeemable and
[1:01:43] that have been redeemed yes now you say
[1:01:46] well what about the world remember all
[1:01:49] that secondary the animals the world is
[1:01:53] all secondary because when man fell
[1:01:56] everything fell under him all right when
[1:01:58] he failed this all fell with it but now
[1:02:00] what's got to happen this don't come up
[1:02:02] first and then us
[1:02:03] we got to come back to our position and
[1:02:06] this automatically comes up and man so
[1:02:09] that brings what the title deed to
[1:02:11] Redemption sealed with seven seals once
[1:02:14] that's broke you know you can worry
[1:02:18] about things that are happening out in
[1:02:20] the world that's okay but I'm going to
[1:02:22] say it one more time
[1:02:23] the only reason that these things are
[1:02:25] happening in the world is because you
[1:02:27] and I are coming to a place you and I
[1:02:30] are coming to a position nothing I don't
[1:02:32] believe anything has ever happened in
[1:02:34] history since the day of Pentecost when
[1:02:40] God m-more feed into his last end more
[1:02:43] feet on the earth you hear me
[1:02:46] on the earth in a bride everything has
[1:02:50] happened because that bride was on this
[1:02:52] earth everything anything that happens
[1:02:58] God's got to reveal it to his bride
[1:03:01] first he's got to give it to his family
[1:03:04] first then an angel came forth the
[1:03:09] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[1:03:11] voice who is worthy to open the book and
[1:03:14] to take the book who was able to open
[1:03:17] the seals who was able to open this book
[1:03:19] see the angel asked it John saw it he
[1:03:22] said Noseworthy let him oh my maybe I'm
[1:03:24] just feeling this away but let him said
[1:03:26] the angel let him and then he stops look
[1:03:29] he's gonna make a point he stopped let
[1:03:32] him here's the book of redemption here
[1:03:35] is the plan of redemption here is the
[1:03:38] only way you'll ever be redeemed so
[1:03:43] don't go looking anywhere else for here
[1:03:47] is the title deed to redemption of the
[1:03:49] whole heavens and earth let him come
[1:03:54] forward if he will oh my
[1:03:56] now speaker forever hold his peace let
[1:03:58] him come forward and claim this book
[1:04:00] who's worthy to do it John said there's
[1:04:04] no man in heaven found worthy no man on
[1:04:05] earth no man beneath the earth that ever
[1:04:07] lived and died was found worthy no man
[1:04:12] was found worthy but remember as
[1:04:16] we were talking about last Sunday and we
[1:04:19] have to see this by revelation that that
[1:04:25] the progression of the scripture brings
[1:04:27] us down to where he has made us unto God
[1:04:30] kings and priests so something is
[1:04:32] developing in this time if Christ is
[1:04:36] worthy the lamb is worthy to take the
[1:04:38] book then he must have made somebody
[1:04:42] worthy because remember he doesn't need
[1:04:47] Redemption
[1:04:50] he didn't need redemption
[1:04:52] he was the Redeemer so he's not doing it
[1:04:56] for himself right he's doing it for us
[1:05:00] because they want to read you something
[1:05:01] right here before we get into revelation
[1:05:04] three brothers you don't have these but
[1:05:07] it's some that we've read before I want
[1:05:08] you to read don't you listen to this
[1:05:10] this is what this lamb has done for us
[1:05:13] I've read it before adoption series
[1:05:16] inheritance by predestination I
[1:05:19] inherited something what inheritance now
[1:05:23] remember this is me somebody had to die
[1:05:26] hold I'm sorry that good somebody had to
[1:05:31] have something you got to have something
[1:05:35] to give right you can't just you know
[1:05:40] the reading of the will is not just
[1:05:42] Charlie was a good of guy and he said by
[1:05:45] that kind of rhymes Charlie was a good
[1:05:47] old boy and guy and he said by but now
[1:05:49] look why cause Charlie did everything
[1:05:51] together but when something's there
[1:05:55] there's an inheritance already in place
[1:05:59] it's waiting for the person to die that
[1:06:03] sounds morbid but you're waiting for the
[1:06:05] person to die and then what the will is
[1:06:07] read and given to the alive people that
[1:06:11] are sent into reading of the world today
[1:06:13] you're setting it the reading of the
[1:06:14] world because watch somebody had an
[1:06:16] inheritance somebody died and somebody
[1:06:18] has reading you the will and telling you
[1:06:20] what you got inheritance by
[1:06:22] predestination I inherited something
[1:06:24] what inheritance there had to be
[1:06:26] somebody to leave me an inheritance well
[1:06:28] you say Jesus
[1:06:30] left you an inheritance beg your pardon
[1:06:34] Jesus never left me an inheritance right
[1:06:37] this is a profit doctrine serious you've
[1:06:40] heard me read it before to me that to me
[1:06:43] that one that one quote right here lines
[1:06:46] everything up but I'm gonna read you
[1:06:48] another one it lines it on up a little
[1:06:49] more
[1:06:50] beg your pardon Jesus never left me an
[1:06:53] inheritance Jesus never left you an
[1:06:56] inheritance he only came down and paid
[1:07:00] for your inheritance brought you to your
[1:07:03] inheritance but your name was put on the
[1:07:06] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:07:08] foundation of the world God gave you
[1:07:11] your inheritance your inheritance was
[1:07:14] first listen the one sitting on the
[1:07:17] throne had the book it had to be taken
[1:07:21] from someone on this side cuz this one
[1:07:25] right here get what I'm saying this one
[1:07:27] here was not in flesh this one was so
[1:07:36] where do we need Redemption the son of
[1:07:39] God never needs a Redemption now the son
[1:07:42] of man never need a Redemption but he
[1:07:44] got in inheritance code I'm pacing read
[1:07:46] something else Revelation chapter 5 now
[1:07:50] our kinsman has handed the seventh
[1:07:52] sealed book of redemption from the
[1:07:53] original owner the original owner when
[1:07:56] we lost it at the Garden of Eden this is
[1:07:58] what we're gonna talk about it Tim Hume
[1:08:00] so y'all just go to sleep and say man
[1:08:02] they everyone okay the original owner
[1:08:05] when we lost it at the Garden of Eden
[1:08:07] through Adam it went back to the
[1:08:08] original owner but there's been a
[1:08:10] poacher on the land a squatter in that
[1:08:13] Satan he came over he's a poacher this
[1:08:16] earth don't belong to him belongs to God
[1:08:19] but he's a poacher a squatter man how I
[1:08:21] could say something right now but I
[1:08:23] better not
[1:08:24] it's the titled that listen is the title
[1:08:26] deed of our redemption this seven sealed
[1:08:28] book it's the title deed you wait till
[1:08:32] we get to those seals now this is
[1:08:33] Revelation chapter 5 they don't have it
[1:08:35] up a look he breaks the seals what watch
[1:08:38] one sitting on throne with a book lambs
[1:08:41] hear the lamb takes the book
[1:08:43] what cup sits down on the throne becomes
[1:08:45] one throne I read the quote man opens
[1:08:47] the book and what reveals the seals okay
[1:08:51] let me guards is that watch but look you
[1:08:57] way do we get into those seals he breaks
[1:08:59] the seals reveals gives us his
[1:09:03] inheritance to his people he gives the
[1:09:07] inheritance that he inherited now this
[1:09:15] guy sitting on the throne is the inherit
[1:09:19] or this one received an inheritance this
[1:09:27] one didn't need one he was the one that
[1:09:30] held the inheritance this one was the
[1:09:33] one that had to come and take the book
[1:09:36] he gives he breaks the seals gives us
[1:09:40] his inheritance to his people he gives
[1:09:43] the inheritance that he inherited
[1:09:45] becoming kinsman redeemer and freely
[1:09:49] gives it out to us it all belonged to
[1:09:53] him he was the one who redeemed but
[1:09:57] instead of keeping in his self he gives
[1:10:00] it back to his people
[1:10:02] Gabriel's instructions to Daniel now we
[1:10:05] find out he was our kinsman redeemer and
[1:10:07] he took the book out of the hand of the
[1:10:09] original owner it is the title deed to
[1:10:12] Redemption we find that you remember the
[1:10:14] study it's a title deed of redemption is
[1:10:16] an abstract deed with it that God
[1:10:18] required life or death in the Garden of
[1:10:21] Eden then Jesus the righteous one died
[1:10:24] and took a title deed and was able to
[1:10:28] break the seals revealed what was in
[1:10:30] them and give the inheritance that
[1:10:33] belonged to him to his people
[1:10:38] eternal life that he inherited by doing
[1:10:41] that while making crops out if you don't
[1:10:45] understand what he's talking about
[1:10:46] now Jesus as Bob said this morning Jesus
[1:10:49] didn't need eternal life he was eternal
[1:10:53] life but his body would
[1:10:56] you see what these sales are for these
[1:10:59] sales are not for the redemption of your
[1:11:01] soul it's for the redemption of your
[1:11:04] body Christ come back with a glorified
[1:11:08] body and he said all power in heaven and
[1:11:12] earth has been given unto me I don't
[1:11:14] have to be bound by a water I don't have
[1:11:19] to be bound by being tired and had to
[1:11:22] sleep he'll know we go to sleep on a
[1:11:25] boat anymore I promise you that
[1:11:27] and a glorified condition but what did
[1:11:29] he do that was his intelligence that was
[1:11:33] his intent heritage but what did he do
[1:11:35] he given us eternal life that he
[1:11:42] inherited now that make he cross-eyed
[1:11:44] now some time he passed his old life
[1:11:47] back out at Calvary and divided among us

[1:13:19] throne not owned in even as I have
[1:13:23] overcome what God give his life took the
[1:13:28] book and reveal the seal right and I'm
[1:13:31] sit down with my father and here strong
[1:13:34] everybody got that say man now what is a
[1:13:37] throne
[1:13:38] he's got the Thrones in my heart listen
[1:13:40] when you first the first thing when you
[1:13:43] think of a throne what do you think uh I
[1:13:44] think of authority position sure it's in
[1:13:51] your heart I know that good grief no
[1:13:54] child I know that the throne of God is
[1:13:57] in your heart but what is it throne
[1:14:00] symbolized Authority a position that
[1:14:04] you've come to that that obviously no
[1:14:07] one else has come to that comes remember
[1:14:10] John didn't see 15 Thrones hold on a
[1:14:13] minute now hold on at that time
[1:14:17] huh
[1:14:19] cuz remember at the white throne
[1:14:21] judgment they were thrown we've been
[1:14:29] given something we've been given the
[1:14:33] authority to judge so we have a throne
[1:14:37] but now we didn't in this scene because
[1:14:40] we had everything hadn't been finished
[1:14:41] you see I'm God you see how God places
[1:14:43] everything revelations 41 John saw one
[1:14:47] Centon on throne he and see 14 Thrones
[1:14:48] 14,000 throne the for elders four and
[1:14:51] twenty elders they weren't sitting on
[1:14:52] the throne there was one person sitting
[1:14:55] on the throne all right revelations
[1:14:59] chapter five verse one number eight so
[1:15:03] just when he said an elder
[1:15:04] come forth or a strong angel weep not
[1:15:06] for the Lion of the tribe of Judah a man
[1:15:08] the root of David he has prevailed a man
[1:15:10] conquered in other words what we were
[1:15:12] talking about last Sunday he was worthy
[1:15:13] to
[1:15:14] the book remember he hadn't seen him up
[1:15:16] to this time why he was sitting on a
[1:15:19] seated on a throne in there God's throne
[1:15:23] he wasn't he was on the inside of the
[1:15:26] sanctuary right got it he hadn't seen
[1:15:31] him to this time so John was expecting
[1:15:33] to see line came forth but he saw a lamb
[1:15:35] now listen we got to stay on the lamb
[1:15:37] because remember the lamb is the one
[1:15:39] that breaks to seal so let's don't worry
[1:15:42] about the line of Judah forget that
[1:15:44] right now if we don't get the lamb part
[1:15:47] right you're not gonna worry about
[1:15:49] because what line is a judge line is
[1:15:52] bold he's he's the judge but watch sorry
[1:15:58] let's go to the next one number nine
[1:16:00] souls in prison John looked around there
[1:16:03] was no one in heaven no man on earth
[1:16:05] nobody in no angel nothing could take
[1:16:06] the book or the loose the seals don't
[1:16:08] even look at it
[1:16:08] no man was worthy John said he wept
[1:16:10] bitterly now what's what's he looking
[1:16:13] for he's not looking for an angel he's
[1:16:14] not looking for a what a theophany hello
[1:16:20] he's looking for a human with some skin
[1:16:23] on him then an angel came to him and
[1:16:26] said we've not John for the line of the
[1:16:28] tribe of Judah has prevailed and he is
[1:16:30] worthy and John look to see a lamb are
[1:16:33] Swift to see a lion and what did he find
[1:16:36] a lamb and it was a bloody lamb a land
[1:16:39] that had been slain because the Bible
[1:16:41] said he stood as a lamb slain before the
[1:16:43] foundation of the world all right how
[1:16:45] long since the foundation of the world
[1:16:47] the lamb came forth walked up to him
[1:16:50] that had the book in his right hand and
[1:16:52] received the book climbed up on the
[1:16:56] throne and sat down that's it it was
[1:16:59] over when the seals was revealed I agree
[1:17:03] a hundred percent when they're revealed
[1:17:05] remember he told them they went revealed
[1:17:08] back then he said you're not getting it
[1:17:10] he told him they were all right but
[1:17:16] we're in this dispensation we're alive
[1:17:20] and remain we which are alive and remain
[1:17:24] shall not prevent or hinder those
[1:17:26] sleeeeep okay so now we're here we're
[1:17:30] here we read the quote he said they
[1:17:33] weren't getting it they weren't getting
[1:17:34] it cuz the Prophet said they weren't
[1:17:36] getting it but there is a group that's
[1:17:38] gonna get it alright
[1:17:39] it was over when the seals was revealed
[1:17:41] when the last one that was everything
[1:17:43] that he'd redeemed there was nothing he
[1:17:45] came to redeem him safe why didn't he
[1:17:47] redeem them forty years ago
[1:17:49] 2,000 years ago see their names are on
[1:17:51] the book of life in that book now watch
[1:17:54] he what's he asking the question why
[1:17:56] didn't he redeem them to tell what
[1:17:58] happened 2,000 years ago he died on a
[1:18:00] cross everything was done when he said
[1:18:03] his finished he went lying but remember
[1:18:06] it wasn't applied until we got here I
[1:18:10] wasn't here at Calvary
[1:18:11] you weren't here at Calvary but my name
[1:18:14] got called called it was in that book
[1:18:17] alright here he had to stand here
[1:18:20] because it was God's purpose to redeem
[1:18:22] them their names were put on the Lamb's
[1:18:24] Book of Life before the foundation of
[1:18:26] the world the lamb was put there with it
[1:18:31] the inheritance he inherited I like that
[1:18:34] here comes the lamb when was slain came
[1:18:38] back to make intercession all right now
[1:18:42] let's read number 10 right here's what
[1:18:43] one against where every wanted to get to
[1:18:45] for an hour and then we went back and
[1:18:50] got the kinsman redeemer and picked him
[1:18:52] up what he's work was and now for all
[1:18:54] these years Christ has been doing the
[1:18:56] kinsman redeemer work
[1:18:58] now all the understand that say a man
[1:19:00] wake up you can say a man if you'll wake
[1:19:02] up I don't know you need to what he'd do
[1:19:09] is take you a little thank you a pen and
[1:19:12] some of y'all need a big one and God
[1:19:19] forbid if one of you husbands or wives
[1:19:20] punch each other and get mad at each
[1:19:22] other for waking each other up
[1:19:23] now you're going work you go answer to
[1:19:25] God for that your mates helping you stay
[1:19:28] awake if not either one of you may not
[1:19:31] care care if the other one makes it but
[1:19:33] I can't Jim likes it
[1:19:37] then alright hey man we got a struggle s
[1:19:41] and it's a fight
[1:19:42] it's an overcoming I'm not going Church
[1:19:46] today I'll watch it online
[1:19:47] you're not an overcomer you're not an
[1:19:50] overcomer
[1:19:51] he that overcometh gets in his car where
[1:19:54] they feel like it or not but wait you
[1:20:01] want to go to church every Sunday know
[1:20:05] what it's like the joke about the woman
[1:20:09] saying honey get up you gotta go to
[1:20:10] church I ain't going to church yeah come
[1:20:12] on honey you gotta give a guy go to
[1:20:13] church he said I'm not going to church
[1:20:15] the son he said then people bunch
[1:20:16] hypocrites they don't love me and I
[1:20:18] ain't worried about it she said honey
[1:20:20] you're the pastor you gotta go to church
[1:20:25] but there come a time that when the
[1:20:28] redeeming work will be over and when the
[1:20:31] redeeming work is over this kind of
[1:20:34] works all that was done it then he
[1:20:36] leaves the throne of God where he's
[1:20:38] seated now now let's stop right there
[1:20:41] now listen his intercessory work
[1:20:45] remember down to the church ages he was
[1:20:49] the son of God his his people were born
[1:20:56] again under the revelation on this rock
[1:20:59] I'll build my church amen and not
[1:21:04] belittling them at all but that's all
[1:21:06] they needed to know they didn't have a
[1:21:08] quote book they'd hardly have a Bible
[1:21:10] but they believed that Christ died for
[1:21:13] their sin and God you know what he was
[1:21:16] just purchased good hey I'm so happy if
[1:21:19] that's all they see they're my children
[1:21:21] I saw that they didn't want anything but
[1:21:24] me that's why here in the end time if we
[1:21:29] if we come up higher we have to not to
[1:21:35] get a revelation like Bob said not to
[1:21:37] get a revelation beyond the prophet lord
[1:21:40] have mercy how in the world huh I can't
[1:21:42] hardly get this one
[1:21:44] how am I gonna get another one a new one
[1:21:46] can't but there will come a time when
[1:21:50] the redeeming work will be over when the
[1:21:51] redeeming work is over then he leaves
[1:21:52] the throne of God remember he's seated
[1:21:54] he's interceding now you got to see this
[1:21:58] watch because remember the son of man
[1:22:01] who came to earth here we're gonna
[1:22:04] change positions a little bit here the
[1:22:06] Son of Man comes to earth
[1:22:08] he's the Redeemer he's the one that gets
[1:22:11] the inheritance father God doesn't need
[1:22:16] an inheritance he is the inheritance the
[1:22:20] son of God eternal life but when you
[1:22:23] come to this Redemption scene that lamb
[1:22:25] the Prophet God said I think it really a
[1:22:27] couple of Sundays ago that lamb wasn't a
[1:22:30] lamb is what we see because a lamb can't
[1:22:32] reach and get a book it had to be a
[1:22:35] human but it was the Lamb of God that
[1:22:38] takes away the sin of the world what the
[1:22:40] son of man but when he left he comes
[1:22:44] back on the day of Pentecost that's the
[1:22:46] son of God he's sitting on the Father's
[1:22:48] throne
[1:22:49] there's got to be a position change to
[1:22:52] get us out of here that all rights a man
[1:22:56] all right because look I have overcome
[1:22:58] their watch now he goes back then he
[1:23:01] leaves the throne of God where he's
[1:23:03] seated down but that's not his throne
[1:23:09] that's not his problem you say oh my
[1:23:13] goodness this was sitting on the throne
[1:23:14] but you said this one just comfortable
[1:23:17] and turn around and sit down alone
[1:23:19] remember there's only one through one
[1:23:23] throne and one person sitting on the
[1:23:26] throne that's not three sitting on one
[1:23:29] that would be crowded God's real
[1:23:33] comfortable sitting on his own throne
[1:23:35] because he's the only one sitting on it
[1:23:37] hey man but now remember because when we
[1:23:40] become worthy and we come to the
[1:23:42] revelations 19 or 20 in there there's
[1:23:45] Thrones right you and I have come to a
[1:23:50] position he leaves the throne of God
[1:23:53] where he seated now but that's not his
[1:23:55] throne he that overcometh your
[1:23:57] with me in my song what church age is
[1:23:59] that this one he that overcomes will sit
[1:24:02] with me in my throne as I have overcome
[1:24:04] and have sit down on my Father's throne
[1:24:06] that is not his throne that belongs to
[1:24:10] Spirit God the Son of God the Creator
[1:24:14] the one before the foundation of the
[1:24:15] world theophany got that all right
[1:24:19] but that theophany God had to amor fie
[1:24:23] into a lamb son of man to take the book
[1:24:31] to redeem that's how revelations 5 is so
[1:24:36] sublime you see everything you see all
[1:24:38] the way from the creation the fall
[1:24:41] Christ coming bleeding dying give us an
[1:24:44] inheritance now look he's that's not his
[1:24:48] throne that belongs to Spirit God Christ
[1:24:53] the lamb it doesn't belong to him now
[1:24:55] that's not saying that God sitting on
[1:24:57] the throne and saying now you can't come
[1:24:58] up here and settle in front of me that's
[1:24:59] not what he's saying but it's the
[1:25:01] position that's got to change the same
[1:25:05] man that's sitting on the throne is this
[1:25:07] one because when this one takes the book
[1:25:09] he becomes the one on the front all
[1:25:13] right that belongs to spirit God Christ
[1:25:16] the lamb it doesn't belong to him he is
[1:25:18] the Incarnate God which is the same
[1:25:21] garden he's talking about Christ the
[1:25:22] lamb some of the guards not incarnate
[1:25:25] God it's not a man's incarnate God
[1:25:27] incarnate means that he'd come from
[1:25:30] spirit into flesh that all right I just
[1:25:34] want to explain that today okay
[1:25:36] number eleven John hadn't noticed this
[1:25:41] lamb before you know here he hadn't been
[1:25:43] mentioned before no word had it been
[1:25:46] mentioned John didn't see it all over
[1:25:48] the heavens as he was looking because
[1:25:49] remember he he was looking and found no
[1:25:52] one worthy then all of a sudden appears
[1:25:56] a lamb now the one sitting on Thrones
[1:26:00] always been there see John had to know
[1:26:04] that that person was in the position of
[1:26:06] supreme authority at the time because he
[1:26:09] had the book so
[1:26:10] he's standing holding the book when our
[1:26:11] John knows if there's not this can't get
[1:26:15] to John it's set to human that's why he
[1:26:19] said who's worthy I see all these well
[1:26:21] yeah others humans out here I see these
[1:26:23] angels standing here but who's gonna
[1:26:25] take his book who's going to do the
[1:26:28] redeeming work then what the lamb comes
[1:26:31] out from behind the throne brother
[1:26:33] Branham said he was behind we read in a
[1:26:35] minute it came from look where did it
[1:26:37] come from
[1:26:38] it came from what he was hidden in the
[1:26:43] Father's throne because remember the son
[1:26:46] of man revelation is not till the end
[1:26:48] time so he was hiding in the Son of God
[1:26:53] revelation amen but in revealing you've
[1:26:59] got what you got to come out and as he
[1:27:03] came out John saw him and you know what
[1:27:07] John knew who he was John saw him
[1:27:11] hanging on the cross John saw him after
[1:27:14] John saw him in a glorified body icewine
[1:27:19] down a little bit further we I read it
[1:27:20] yeah but John said everybody in heaven
[1:27:23] heard my voice everybody on earth heard
[1:27:26] my voice you are worthy so where did it
[1:27:30] come from to come from the father strong
[1:27:31] we had been seated since he had been
[1:27:34] slain and raised again hidden in the
[1:27:38] father strong what making intercession
[1:27:41] what he's interceding for us why the
[1:27:44] Lamb of God is who we look to amen all
[1:27:48] right say man he raised up and set on
[1:27:51] what the right hand of God ever living
[1:27:53] to make intercession a man raised there
[1:27:55] today as our intercessor today he's
[1:28:00] interceding for your thoughts that you
[1:28:01] got in your mind he's interceding for
[1:28:04] the things that we're gonna do next week
[1:28:06] in the next week in the next week what
[1:28:10] with his own blood to make intercession
[1:28:12] upon the ignorance of me put your name
[1:28:17] there if you want good
[1:28:19] oh now oh that's the one I'm depending
[1:28:22] on he still was covered with bleach the
[1:28:26] bleach of the forgiveness of sin all
[1:28:29] right number 12 real quick because we
[1:28:33] got to cover this that we got to get to
[1:28:35] it the breach how did you hold us see
[1:28:37] anything but that bloody lamb standing
[1:28:39] there and the lamb proceeded out into
[1:28:41] the vision now here he calls the
[1:28:42] division now as it had been slain notice
[1:28:45] come from the Father's throne
[1:28:47] Oh think where did he advanced from to
[1:28:51] this vision he comes from glory where
[1:28:53] he's seated at the right hand remember
[1:28:55] the Bible says he's seated at the right
[1:28:56] hand of God never making intercession
[1:28:59] why he can't be on the earth in that
[1:29:05] body not yet
[1:29:07] he can't be here he's got to be
[1:29:10] somewhere God's a person the body's not
[1:29:14] laying a brother brother Devon divided
[1:29:15] not laying up there on the throne he's
[1:29:18] alive and well he's not dead but he's
[1:29:22] sitting up on that Father's throne
[1:29:23] making intercession waiting on us to
[1:29:29] come to the revelation that he was down
[1:29:31] here in us he come from glory where he
[1:29:36] seated at the right hand of God he
[1:29:38] advanced forth to join out of glory so
[1:29:41] he came somewhere well okay look he
[1:29:44] advanced forth to me out of glory you
[1:29:48] got to put your name in there
[1:29:49] number 13 did you notice the arrangement
[1:29:52] of that now this is 1963 how can I
[1:29:54] overcome 8:25 so this is after the seals
[1:29:56] are broke all right did you notice the
[1:29:58] arrangement I like that southern take to
[1:30:00] all them eight eyes and you that call
[1:30:03] range Minh see the raiment of that see
[1:30:06] sit with me in my throne not on my
[1:30:09] throne in my throne that's his domain
[1:30:13] and now as Christ as the ruler throne
[1:30:16] ruler at this time of the complete
[1:30:19] domain of God
[1:30:20] so will the church be with him the bride
[1:30:25] be with him in his throne in the entire
[1:30:28] domain see not on my throne but in
[1:30:32] thrown see where his domain reaches a
[1:30:35] throne is over old domain and the domain
[1:30:38] reaches just as far as its boundaries
[1:30:40] does and this is from eternity to
[1:30:44] Eternity just think of it from eternity
[1:30:47] to eternity now let's read this last one
[1:30:50] we'll be done this is revelation of
[1:30:54] Jesus Christ this is in the church age
[1:30:55] book but let's just not stop there
[1:30:58] reading our revelations 3:21 to him that
[1:31:00] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[1:31:02] in my throne even as I also overcame and
[1:31:04] him sitting down with my father in his
[1:31:06] throne also read Hebrews 12:2 looking
[1:31:10] unto Jesus the author and finisher of
[1:31:12] our faith who for the joy that was set
[1:31:14] before him endured the cross despising
[1:31:16] the shame and is set down at the right
[1:31:19] hand of the throne of God that's what
[1:31:21] we're just talking about he's on the
[1:31:22] Father's throne making intercession but
[1:31:25] now we got a promise in this church age
[1:31:26] that we will sit with him in his throne
[1:31:30] not this one he is but now remember when
[1:31:35] he come around sit down on this one this
[1:31:36] is gets a little confusing but you got
[1:31:39] to let the Lord reveal it to you okay
[1:31:41] all right same God but watch what this
[1:31:44] says right here here sit down
[1:31:46] with the father what no I'm sorry did I
[1:31:50] read on notice that according to Jesus
[1:31:51] himself who wrote the revelation he has
[1:31:54] sat down with the father the spirit and
[1:31:57] Paul what spirit is the Spirit of Christ
[1:31:58] for that is the spirit of prophecy for
[1:32:00] by the word comes since he had sat down
[1:32:02] at the right hand of God but when John
[1:32:04] looked he saw only one upon the throne
[1:32:07] and it was not until revelations 5:6 2:8
[1:32:11] which follows revelation 4 2 to 3 in
[1:32:13] sequence of time that we see the Lamb
[1:32:15] taking the book from him Capital age he
[1:32:19] did that I didn't him that sit on the
[1:32:21] throne as indicated in Revelation 4 2 3
[1:32:24] and 9 through 10 what is it it is the
[1:32:27] mystery of one God right now we saw all
[1:32:31] kind of people run everywhere here in
[1:32:32] Revelations 5 we've had all people
[1:32:34] running all over the place
[1:32:36] where brother Brown said it's the
[1:32:37] mystery of boiling hot
[1:32:40] he Jesus came out from God became
[1:32:44] manifested in flesh died and rose again
[1:32:47] and returned to the bosom of the Father
[1:32:50] as John said the only begotten Son which
[1:32:53] is in the bosom of the Father he hath
[1:32:56] declared him John 1:18 it was not now
[1:32:59] time it was now time for God Messiah to
[1:33:03] come back to claim his bride then
[1:33:05] present himself make himself known to
[1:33:08] Israel thus we see God again stepping
[1:33:11] forth to assume a physical relationship
[1:33:14] to man as the son of David King of Kings
[1:33:17] Lord of lords the bridegroom of the
[1:33:19] Gentile bride it is not to gods but
[1:33:22] simply one God manifesting his mighty
[1:33:25] triune offices and titles all that
[1:33:29] workings done by one man but we have to
[1:33:34] see his you say what what's what what in
[1:33:36] the world what is that important if we
[1:33:39] stay with the Son of God revelation we
[1:33:43] do as all the others we die and go by
[1:33:46] the grave and you know you hear this
[1:33:49] over and over of musicians come you hear
[1:33:51] this over and over but one day it's
[1:33:53] going to strike you with something we've
[1:33:55] got to move out of the birth canal the
[1:34:00] prophet turned us the right way he's
[1:34:04] brought something forth but you and I
[1:34:07] have got to take that and what oh that's

[1:42:03] intercession for it so why do I have to
[1:42:06] pray I'm not the intercessor you just go
[1:42:10] straight to God you just believe that
[1:42:12] and when you take that thing to the
[1:42:15] doctor you take that thing to whatever
[1:42:16] you got you say I've already confessed
[1:42:19] it I confessed it to God what are you

[1:42:49] apply that attach that to your life
[1:42:52] attach that to what you need and when
[1:42:55] you make a confession you go back and
[1:42:58] say God I've already confessed that to
[1:43:00] you and when you go to the doctor and he
[1:43:04] says you got high blood pressure and you
[1:43:05] stand here and say when I go to the
[1:43:07] doctor I want him to tell me I don't
[1:43:09] have high blood pressure well why don't
[1:43:10] we need to pray you've already done it
[1:43:12] the confession was right here all you
[1:43:15] got to do is go to the doctor say hey
[1:43:17] doctor whatever you say I've already
[1:43:20] confessed I've already confessed the
[1:43:23] difference family problem same way you
[1:43:26] go home expecting something you say well
[1:43:28] when I get home I want everything to be
[1:43:31] what you told me that what am I gonna
[1:43:35] pray
[1:43:36] you've just said what you were gonna do
[1:43:38] your confession we must confess our sin
[1:43:42] the Bible didn't say come up and have
[1:43:44] the preacher pray and slap all over you
[1:43:46] and beat you in the head
[1:43:47] [Music]
[1:43:49] he said confess your faults one to
[1:43:52] another and what the Lord Himself will
[1:43:57] intercede for that and he'll take care
[1:43:59] of it
[1:44:00] listen laying hands is okay but it's a
[1:44:03] tradition it's a tradition the Gentile
[1:44:11] way is is what did what did the
[1:44:14] Centurion say he made a confession he
[1:44:18] said he said man I've got somebody sick
[1:44:21] at my house Jesus said well okay I'll oh
[1:44:24] goodness God was he said okay I'll get
[1:44:27] up and go to you how he said no now
[1:44:29] there was his confession no you don't
[1:44:34] need to come to my house look at the
[1:44:36] confession he said you don't need to
[1:44:39] come to my house I'm a man of authority
[1:44:41] I say go I say come you're a man of
[1:44:45] authority look at his confession you say
[1:44:48] go you say come you know what he's
[1:44:49] telling him he said Jesus whatever you
[1:44:52] say in that spot
[1:44:56] that's the way it'll be he said because
[1:44:59] I know when I tell the Centurion to go
[1:45:03] out didn't get me a cup of water and
[1:45:04] bring it back I know he's gonna do it
[1:45:05] cuz I've Authority so now you as a
[1:45:10] person of authority if you say and then
[1:45:14] What did he say he said I found no
[1:45:16] greater faith in Israel because Israel
[1:45:18] wants you to do this you know they want
[1:45:20] you to
[1:45:20] [Music]
[1:45:23] Jarius you know come in and touch my
[1:45:25] daughter the Centurion said look I have
[1:45:28] made a confession I know you know what
[1:45:30] he was saying I know what power lays
[1:45:33] inside of you because I have the same
[1:45:36] earthly power I don't have a heavenly
[1:45:39] power like that but I have an earthly
[1:45:41] power and I can connect that my
[1:45:43] confession is whatever you say jesus
[1:45:48] said go and let it be as you spoke and
[1:45:52] what'd he say remember the guy come
[1:45:53] running he said when did that happen he
[1:45:57] said about eleven o'clock or whatever in
[1:45:59] the Centurion said well that's the same
[1:46:01] time I was talking to the Lord
[1:46:05] same way with all of us just make your
[1:46:08] confession go to the doctor he says you
[1:46:12] got something wrong say okay but I've
[1:46:16] came here and I confess to who created
[1:46:18] this thing I've confessed to the man
[1:46:22] that created this you're here just to
[1:46:24] keep us lined up and that's really a
[1:46:27] doctor does he just keeps you lined up
[1:46:28] I'm here to keep you lined up or he's
[1:46:31] here to keep you lined up but there's
[1:46:32] one that can what create there's one
[1:46:36] that can take something out and make it
[1:46:38] totally disappear and not have to cut a
[1:46:40] gap this way
[1:46:43] hey man sister Mina didn't have to go to
[1:46:46] an operation to get that big old order
[1:46:48] or cancer off of her stomach what God
[1:46:53] just dissolved it and made it disappear
[1:46:55] now what doctor did that there is no
[1:47:01] doctor they can do that but when you
[1:47:05] make a confession you stand on that
[1:47:08] confession because you've confessed it
[1:47:10] to God
[1:47:10] you've not confessing it to you that we
[1:47:16] have such a Catholic idea brother down
[1:47:21] pray for my children but that when I get
[1:47:24] home we're gonna be playing cards and
[1:47:25] got the TV on and come on people we're
[1:47:33] not here sure we're here to what we do
[1:47:35] intercede if you need prayer no doubt
[1:47:39] but that's not the way it should be it
[1:47:43] should be believe in your heart and
[1:47:45] confess with your mouth and let God take
[1:47:50] care of it cuz you know what one day I
[1:47:52] couldn't find that father one day I was
[1:47:56] having a heart attack I know it was I
[1:47:58] couldn't find that father but I found a
[1:48:01] Heavenly Father and he's been with me
[1:48:04] ever since
[1:48:05] amen that's what you and I have to look
[1:48:08] at when you can't find your daddy you
[1:48:11] always got your daddy right there with
[1:48:13] you
[1:48:14] cuz you know what if you were in that
[1:48:16] book he's already took claims of it your
[1:48:19] body too
[1:48:22] your body - that's where the healing
[1:48:25] comes patina is what the potential body
[1:48:28] change hey man if you got scars you
[1:48:33] don't don't have a scar system II didn't
[1:48:34] have a scar that's potential body change
[1:48:37] when God took that thing out of our side
[1:48:39] they wouldn't scar there but if you got
[1:48:41] a scar somewhere you're not gonna carry
[1:48:42] that scar with you oh that's going away
