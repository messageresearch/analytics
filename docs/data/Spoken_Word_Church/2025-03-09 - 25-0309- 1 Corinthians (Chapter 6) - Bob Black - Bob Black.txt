========================================

[Music] God bless you Saints good to be in the house of the Lord this morning let's go to the Lord in prayer Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word I pray guide us today Lord Jesus bless the service Lord help us Lord to gain more understanding and more strength and more power Lord we ask Lord that you'll bless today Lord in your name amen so we're on 1 Corinthians 6 and 1 Corinthians six um starts off like this dare any of you having a matter against another go to law before the unjust um yeah I uh oh there we go thank you brothers that's a little bit better dare any of you having a matter against another go to law before the unjust and not before the Saints do you not know that the Saints shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters know you not that we shall judge Angels how much more things that pertain to this life isn't that interesting that he's calling out that you you have the ability a saint a born again Christian should have the ability to judge things of life and uh you know sometimes we get caught up in the in uh maybe we look at scriptures the wrong way and we think well we're not supposed to judge well there are things we're not supposed to judge and there are things we are supposed to judge and look in this case Paul's saying you're you're supposed to have the ability to be able to judge situations and to be able to judge right from wrong and look at something and say whether it's correct or not uh e even even to the smallest thing somebody somebody says they did work for somebody else and they didn't get paid or whatever and then um he said why are you taking somebody to court to be judged by uh a a heathen somebody that's not born again when you should in the church have somebody that you can uh go to to reconcile uh these kind of situations so if we really examine the kind of judgments if kind of look at judgment for a second there's two kind of judgments there's that Judgment of you I I I've got this little table of I'm not going to go through this table too in depth but there's really two time kind of judgments the a judgment of a motive and then there's a judgment of fruits it's really hard to tell what somebody's real motive is it's like a Iceberg floating in the water you know there's part of the iceberg under the water and part of the iceberg above the water you it's real hard to tell what somebody's real motives and intents are under the water but you certainly can look at the fruit and tell whether the fruit is right or wrong and what what the fruit is fruit's usually like like at work where when we're when we're giving reviews or whatever they say you got to be specific and the fruit fruit is usually pretty specific like like this morning before we come to church we had a we had an onion that we found out was rotten and and you can be pretty specific that it it needs to be thrown out there's something wrong with that I don't want to eat that and so like for example if somebody tells a lie and they get caught in a lie then you can be pretty specific that that's not right if somebody is unjust about their payment to somebody they they they hire somebody to do some work and then they don't pay well that's pretty you can be specific about that so now you you you'd have to be uh you absolutely can judge the fruit to say whether the fruit is right now that might or might or might not speak to somebody what's under the iceberg what what's under the water it might U but it certainly speaks to what the fruit is now so so we look at all these different types of judgment there's hypocritical judgment where Jesus said in Matthew seven Jud be careful how you judge judge not that you be not judged for what me judgment you judge you shall be judged and with what measure you meet it shall be measured to you again so if if you're looking at somebody and you're judging them for the same thing that you're actually doing now and that that's the human nature we don't realize sometimes so often the things that we are doing so he's caution hold on before you start throwing out that judgment and point that finger you know what we say so many times that when you point your finger there's there's actually three pointing back at you so be careful when you point the finger that you're actually judging with righteous judgment there's also the personal preference and opinion judgment in Romans 14 why why does thou judge thy Brethren why does thou set it not thy brother so in other words we got to be careful that we don't judge somebody just because of a personal conviction ition or or in in the case of the Corinthians dietary choices or special days or Traditions that don't really have any direct bearing on salvation or clear biblical commands like a good example is that every every every December it comes up again that we start throwing out the Judgment because somebody gives gifts to their kids or somebody you know they have a Christmas tree or they put up some lights or whatever all of a sudden then uh people are preaching I've heard sermons about well these people are actually worshiping the devil cuz they got and and it's like that come on now you got to be careful that you don't get into the wrong territory judging just because of a personal conviction or something that doesn't really have any bearing to somebody's salvation in other words throwing somebody on the bus when they that you know condemning or final judgment speak not evil one of another brotherr he that speaketh evil of his brother and judgeth his brother now this is this is that that that Judgment of looking under the iceberg and saying I I I my you ain't even born again you ain't even this or putting that label on somebody judgeth his brother speaketh evil of the law and judgeth the law how how do you speak evil of the law if you judge somebody like that because the Leviticus 19 says Thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people but Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself ain't that interesting that that's an Old Testament statement that's an Old Testament commandment we placed that in the New Testament but that's Old Testament to love thy neighbor as thyself to not bear any grudge against the children of thy people speak not evil one of another Brethren he that speaketh evil of his brother and judgeth his brother speaketh evil of the law that's looking under the iceberg I think one of the most dangerous things that comes into the church is is is when we kind of get in our mind that we have a special gift of discernment to be able to look under the iceberg I find I found just in my own life looking back at different people sometimes uh I'm throwing this out there sometimes the people that are so convinced that they have a special gift of discernment have maybe the most problems because they're they're they have the inability to actually look in the mirror at their own self they're more concerned with saying that they can discern the other person now if you do have a gift of discernment that's that's wonderful but it will be a help to the church it will not be something to Lord over somebody or to hold up and say well bless God I'm I I got you under my thumb and right I I remember years ago I've come across different people I've come you sit you sit there and they they're like I I I've got a gift to discernment and they they hold they want to hold it over your head and and place you in a place where where they are the one in control and meanwhile their whole life is many times a train wreck amen so if you've got if you've got a gift of discernment look in the mirror of God's word and make sure that your life is correct you you you look at brother brandom's life that that his he had a true gift of discernment but his life he was really living the gospel laying down his life uh like Paul's uh yielding himself and putting himself into a place where he he he uh his life was totally spotless now that's where we that's where the place that we want to be if we're going to put oursel into a place where we can look under the iceberg look under the water examine oursel first amen now what look at what brother R saying it this Corinthian Church really was a mess they're in such a mess where the people in that church are maybe looking around saying I don't have anybody that I have confidence in to judge things fairly if if I place my my situation in front of this person then they're they're going to be biased toward their family if I place my situation in front of this person they're not going to be able to look at look at things correctly that nobody has wisdom and and so Paul's saying look if you don't have any confidence anybody you ought to be able to just find like the least person the least in the the least in your church and just go to them there should be somebody that's got the holy ghost that you can go to that's got a fair impartial like a a gift of wisdom to be able to judge things rightly he's saying even a young Corinthian believer should know how to judge biblically dis distinguishing clearly between judging the heart and motives which is God's job alone or judging the actions and the fruit which is a believer's responsibility amen a Believer any believer should be able to uh you you know you you you look at your children coming in from work or or staying out late at night and you should be able to say well that ain't right you look at or a young person that's that's seeking a spouse should be able to look at somebody that's that uh uh seems like a a good candidate for to spend the rest of your life with and say and judge whether that person really is what they say they are if they got all these Facebook photos and things of them going to the beach and wearing shorts and and and bathing suits and stuff then you should be able to judge and say well that does not look correct that doesn't because of the fruit because of the actions because of the works it it looks like there's something misplaced in that person's life so Paul said in verse four he said if then if then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church I speak to your shame now when we read First Corinthians we can read it like like we're going to school but let's read it like we're actually there and and you'll notice as Paul Paul Paul says a lot of things that are sarcastic he'll he'll take their statements of the Corinth is he'll throw them back and we'll see in a moment he'll take he'll take their statements that they make and he'll throw them back in their face and and and he'll he'll say things in a way that to to bring shame to them like in other words you you say you're born again but hold on now have you really living it I speak to your shame is it so that there is not a wise man among you in your whole church is there not somebody that you can go to with your problems and that you have confidence in to to to lay things at their feet and say well look ch choose what's right know not one that shall be able to judge between his brother but brother goeth the law with brother and that before the unbelievers and verse 7even now therefore there is utterly a fault among you because you go to law one with another why do you not rather take wrong why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded now there's a good question for a Believer isn't it would wouldn't it be better in light of your Christian testimony to Bear a little bit of personal Injustice to to just to just put up with one another sometimes rather than tarnish the reputation of Christ rather to drag all of your problems and things out in front of a court and and then have everybody in the in the Gentile world and the Heathen World question whether what you say is really true and dragging your testimony through the mud wouldn't it be better just to Bear some faults bear some wrongs nay you do wrong and defraud and that your brother now now look you can see how I tied verse 8 with verse 11 that's where sometimes it helps to read things from the context just think about the context and verse 8 he saying you do wrong and defraud and that your brother and then he's well well let's read the whole thing he said know ye not that the unrighteous unrighteous meaning defrauding robbing one another not treating one another right the fruits the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkers nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God and such were some of you now now this is where he's throwing it back in their face in in a sarcasm such were some of you in other words you claim to be you claim to be changed but you are washed you're Sanctified but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of God what he's saying is so act like it you're sitting here defrauding one another and and doing things wrong I I don't mean I'm not preaching at y'all I feel like I'm it's okay y'all Paul's talking to the Corinthians here if you behave like the world you don't belong to the kingdom of heaven is what he's saying if you don't belong if you don't if you behave like the world you don't belong to the kingdom of heaven now now look you can see how these this evidence of the new birth kind of go is is there's something under the iceberg but there's something above the iceberg above the water something below the water something above the water of the iceberg there's your faith that God can see your motives the underlying you know where you where when you're home and you're praying and you're thinking about things what you really want to to see done you're Direct in life but then there's the fruits that are manifested so Paul's saying now look I'm looking at you and I'm judging you by the outward expression of your life and you're sitting here robbing one another and taking one another to court and not having confidence in in anybody's wisdom in church and not having confidence in in your church really a a and and I'm looking at this situation like uh if you don't if you ain't acting like the world something's something's wrong if you're acting like the world something's wrong in verse 12 he says now this's this is where he's taking a statement that the Corinthians make all things are lawful unto me because they believe they could just get away with anything because they got Grace and now he's throwing it back in their face you say you say all things are lawful unto me but he's like but but all things are not expedient in other words there there's a lot of things that because of Grace that I can do you know there I can I can uh you know I can uh but all things are not expedient all things are lawful unto me for me but I will not be brought under the power of any now I got down there at the bottom right the all the things on social media there's there's some good things that you can get off of social media we'll use that as an example you can learn about power tools and you can learn about what something that'll help you on your job and you can learn about cooking and all those kind of things but he say all all I can I can do anything but I will not be brought under the power so when you start being brought under the power of it and now you're a servant to it and you're just sitting there Doom scrolling scrolling through it all day every day and you've you're it's it's now has a power over you where you're not praying and you you're you're getting away from what God is calling you to do and now you're a slave to it so the Corinthians were probably saying since we are under grace and not under the law we can do whatever we want we're free in Christ Christ now look at verse 13 Meats for the belly this is another statement of the Corinthians that he's throwing back in their face Meats for the belly and belly for the meats and the belly for Meats in other words they've had this idea that if you've got an appetite any kind of an appetite whether to eat or the other it read between the lines that then you should feel it and you think that was the Corinthians but I've come across people in life you know where they they're raising their kids that way well you're not born again so if you got an appetite you might as well go out there in the world and feel it and fulfill it you you might as well take advantage of the opportun this is this is the way that this is the way that some people with a with a carnal unregenerate mind will think about things and why we need the new birth because if you're looking at things like well if you're not born again yet if you haven't come to conversion you might as well you might as well satisfy the app the carnal appetite that you're you're raising your children wrong you're raising your children like a like a carnal Corinthian amen this is what Paul's trying to straighten out he's saying but God shall destroy both it it and them if you got a good plate of grits in front of you one day that those grits are going to be go away right but think about the Eternal if you're uh and we get he's getting into this that if there's a a harlot one day that will be destroyed but think about the Eternal God shall destroy both it and them now the body is not for fornication but for the Lord and the Lord for the body so they believe that if there's an appetite you might as well feel it I remember years ago brother D preaching on Temperance and how even Temperance even applies to when you you're in that Buffet line and you just can't control that's something to think about in So that's what he's he's striking back at that the inability to control anything it if you got a anyway well y'all get the point Meats for the belly and the belly for Meats but God shall destroy both it and them now the body is not for fornication but for the Lord and the Lord for the body now you start thinking about what the body really is for the body is is not just and then I'm just going to read some some of my notes here that I got here on the left that uh in in verse 13 Paul saying your body is for the Lord not for sexual immorality and verse 14 says and God hath both raised up the Lord and will also raise up Us by his own power in other words he's saying here's some proof for you that God has raised Christ bodily and he's going to raise us as well so your your body isn't just some disposable shell that's going to be pushed over to the side that your body actually is something that's actually tied to your Eternal destination that when we're in glory I'm going to look like this and you're going to look like that you're going to look like how you did in the prime of your life and it's not just something to to to to just cast aside and that we're going to cast or just to use any old way but it it's our bodies serve as part of our Eternal Destiny being transformed at the resurrection into a glorified Immortal body so that we can dwell forever and the presence of God as part of his perfect and United body so our bodies are a means for us to honor God and serve his purposes now you think about so in verse 15 and 16 he says know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of an Harlot God forbid what know you not that he which is joined to in Harlot is one body for tooth saith he shall be one flesh which is from Genesis where he says therefore shall a man take leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh now you think about that when you when you have a marriage there's two people that are separate that are coming together to join their lives together so that they are one in everything now now get your mind away from the carnal Gutter and and let's think about the the Oneness of of of of a married couple that's living life together when God created woman and from man's side it was to form a Unity that husband and wife would become one flesh so the wife is not merely an independent partner instead she is seen as part of her husband's body which means a deep intimate Union when where both are sharing the same purpose the Same Heart the same mind the same actions and the same spiritual lives now that's transcends all the carnality that normally where we go to when a wife takes her husband's name and both fulfill their roles according to God's word she becomes intrinsically connected with him her life her character and even her inheritance are bound together with his you you know you think now I look back at all my years of of being married to my wife and and uh we're we're so uh you know what this when I have a heartache she's got a heartache when i' when she's got trouble I've got trouble and now that's that's getting into Oneness when I when I'm going through a a like just a little a little spout of dness then she'll make some ice cream you know you know and we're we're bound up together and and I look you know I look in the we we've got our our checking account and our savings account and we're bound up together so much that that that's hers and you know you know you think as you as you grow older you know what if something were to happen to me and the Bible actually says that if you don't leave an inheritance then you're an Infidel if you don't leave something to take care of your family and so that's part part of our our Oneness is is is that I'm you know anything that I would leave behind the house the the little bit of the wind blowing through the bank account whatever whatever whatever's left what whatever I can scr up to leave for her because it's all parted together now the same thing in Christ you're so one a Believer is one with him to the point where whatever he has left for you whatever he your inheritance all these promises lay here are the whatever he's given whatever God has given to Christ he's also given to you because you're so you're so bound up together until you're one you can't separate so in other words now to think about that if if we really get it that that when you're going through a low point then then God he's touched by the feelings of our infirmities right when we're going through a a rough spot then then God he cares about it he he cares and he he's he's uh he he wants he wants the best for us which is his word and so you're so intrinsically connected with him just like my wife and I are intrinsically connected and your your spouse house are so intrinsically connected that our our lives and our character and everything are bound up together now now that that frames what Paul's trying to say to to take that to take all that and then join it with a harlot or join it with something that ain't right now now what we're getting to is is over in Revelation that the the true church the Revelation says is joined to that Harlot because through that balum Doctrine we're we're about about at time so I'm going to be drawing up here in just a minute but he said and and does God ever change mind his mind about his word now see what happens if you if you if you if you take the real Christian church and join it to a harlot idea like Roman Catholicism or something some false teaching then it begins to defile the Christian identity if a person in Christ were to unite with someone living an unrepented sin like a harlot the Christian identity would be defiled just look at it in the fields today he said as balum married into God's Church a harlot married the Harlot into God's church so is these false teachers today trying to tell you they're going to marry every one of these organizations and these people in the old Harlot of Revelation 17 their balum Doctrine going around today and say we're just the same were all Christians and Priests and popes and whatever more all compromising and doing this so you can see a Hara is a woman who's been unfaithful to her husband somebody that's unfaithful to to join yourself to that defiles your identity in verse 15 he says you know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ shall I then take the members of Christ to make them the members of in Harlot God forbid what know ye not that he which is joined to an Harlot is one body for two saith he shall be one flesh but he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit and there's many scriptures that we can list out that show that when you're joined to Christ you're one with him John 17 that they all may be one as thou father art in me John 15 abide in me and I in you you're part of the vine you're you're the branches but he's the vine and Romans 88:9 but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit so Christians are spiritually re United with Christ and this should govern their actions worldly indulgences especially sexual sin contradict that Union because the body belongs to God not personal pleasure true Christian freedom is about honoring that spiritual Unity rather than misusing Liberty for self-gratification so in verse 18 we'll close on this he said flee fornication uh and we could say fornication like in Revelation 17 and fornication natural flee it all every sin that a man doeth is without the body but he that committeth fornication sinth against his own body it it's not like you're just robbing somebody or doing something stealing a stapler at work or whatever you actually hurting your own self what know you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and ye are not your own for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are gods and we made it to First Corinthians 7 so we'll stop there God bless you the musicians can go ahead and come forward [Applause]
