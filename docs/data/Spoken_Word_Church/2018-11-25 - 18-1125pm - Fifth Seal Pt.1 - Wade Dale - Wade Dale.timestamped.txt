[24:13] 6 verse 9 let's bow our heads the Lord
[24:17] Jesus thank you for this day thank you
[24:20] for another opportunity Lord to speak to
[24:23] the ones that you've chosen to be in
[24:27] this hour being this time
[24:31] and more than that to be in this
[24:37] building so that we can all talk about
[24:40] you
[24:41] while the we pray that you'd be with the
[24:43] ones that are not Willis ones that are
[24:44] sick ones that are sin sick Lord we
[24:47] think of many that have fallen away and
[24:49] left and back slid all kind of things
[24:53] Lord we pray that we with this fifth
[24:57] seal coming up Lord we we're gonna see
[25:01] an abundance of grace the Lord that
[25:04] abundance of grace has been extended to
[25:06] all of us all through our life this by
[25:11] the grace of God that we stand here
[25:12] today all of us thinking back right now
[25:17] through all of our lives each individual
[25:20] of the times that maybe something could
[25:23] have happened that we would not have
[25:25] made it this far in life but Lord for
[25:30] some divine opportunity we are here and
[25:35] I say it is a divine opportunity because
[25:38] you knew who was going to be here before
[25:40] the foundation of the world you knew who
[25:44] would and who wouldn't but Lord we pray
[25:45] today that we would all just draw a
[25:48] little bit closer to you realize that as
[25:51] I've always said before man is no way in
[25:55] our humanity that we come up with the
[25:58] word called grace it's only by you Lord
[26:02] that has created this grace to give to a
[26:06] group of people that doesn't deserve it
[26:08] if father we pray that you'd just be
[26:11] with the ones on the foreign fields Lord
[26:12] give them fruit for the labor forgive us
[26:15] of our sins and our daily mistakes Lord
[26:17] lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit
[26:19] be the active participant in this
[26:21] service Jesus name we pray amen and when
[26:25] he had opened the fifth seal you don't
[26:28] have to just bear with me I saw under
[26:31] the altar the souls of them were slain
[26:33] for the word of God and for the
[26:34] testimony which they held and they cried
[26:38] with a loud voice saying how long O Lord
[26:41] holy and true
[26:43] that thou not judge and avenge our blood
[26:44] on them that dwell on the earth and
[26:47] white robes were given unto every one of
[26:49] them and it was said unto them that they
[26:52] should rest yet for a little season
[26:53] until their fellow-servants also and
[26:56] their brethren that should be killed as
[27:00] they were should be fulfilled you may be
[27:03] seated in the Lord at its blessing to
[27:06] the reading of the word so now as we
[27:12] look at the fifth seal we want to just
[27:14] kind of lap back over and for the sake
[27:19] of my voice and to think of all of us
[27:21] here
[27:22] let's go back to where we were several
[27:27] weeks ago and just make sure that we got
[27:32] this together because we got that we've
[27:34] got the church ages one through seven
[27:36] right one through seven and this is the
[27:40] Gentile dispensation right all right
[27:43] this is Gentiles now we can go all the
[27:47] way back into Daniels seventy weeks and
[27:51] look at the chart that brother Branham
[27:52] drew and we can see that we as the wild
[27:57] olive branch was inserted in that
[27:59] timeline of the seventy weeks of Daniel
[28:02] look at your chart it's 69 weeks over
[28:07] here there are 70 weeks determined for
[28:09] the Jews to bring them in like to bring
[28:11] them into the to get rich for the
[28:13] tribulation for the key Battle of
[28:15] Armageddon got it sixty-nine and one
[28:18] well there's an insertion in there and
[28:19] that's the wild olive branch that God
[28:22] has grafted in you and I were grafted in
[28:25] there here's your grafting it's mmm I
[28:29] was telling them in the sentence go
[28:30] class downstairs when we look at Romans
[28:33] we see Romans is talking Paul is talking
[28:37] about a group of people that didn't have
[28:40] the law a group of people that were not
[28:42] righteous people didn't even have a
[28:46] promise the Jews had a promise the whole
[28:52] Old Testament is their promise they had
[28:54] the Torah they've got all the
[28:56] Old Testament prophets but God every
[29:00] time when Jesus was on the earth every
[29:02] time he talked to a Jew
[29:03] a juice I'd you touched me Lord come and
[29:06] see my child come coming to this coming
[29:08] to that but a Gentile a Gentile heathen
[29:14] that had no promise I had no promise of
[29:19] anything he said I perceive you're a man
[29:22] of authority and where you go where I
[29:25] tell people to go they go he said in
[29:27] other words when he was saying Jesus he
[29:29] said I see you have power that you don't
[29:33] have to lay hands on me you just speak
[29:36] the word and my servant will be healed
[29:39] if it was a Jew they'd be good come Oh
[29:41] Lord's got to go over here and we got to
[29:42] do the tour and we got to do the
[29:44] sprinkling and we know that was that was
[29:47] promised to the Jews that wasn't
[29:49] promised to the Gentiles and then what
[29:52] did Jesus say even to the South
[29:53] Phoenicians woman and the Centurion he
[29:55] said I have found no greater faith so
[30:00] see all of you and I listen a Jew what
[30:06] did they do when Jesus was there when
[30:09] Jesus was there they the first thing
[30:11] they said was we be of Abraham
[30:15] they had a lineage they had a promise to
[30:18] go back to they had a temple look to the
[30:21] temple because the Bible told him that's
[30:23] what happened to Jonah remember Jonah
[30:25] Jonah looked toward the temple if you
[30:27] get in trouble look towards the temple
[30:30] that's in the word right look toward the
[30:35] temple or do this or do that that was
[30:37] do's and don'ts it was works things they
[30:39] did because it was promised to the Jews
[30:41] for that to happen but when he come up
[30:43] and saw the Gentiles that just said we
[30:47] believe what you said he said I found no
[30:50] good or faith so what you and I we have
[30:52] to have faith for something we don't see
[30:55] Jews needed to see something but when
[30:58] the very were in Romans or we in Romans
[31:01] 9 9 and 10 read 9 and 10 he talks about
[31:05] the stumbling stone that's the problem
[31:08] there
[31:09] stone was standing in front of them and
[31:12] they stumbled all over him
[31:15] that's why it's called his dumpling
[31:17] stone he came and he was a rock of
[31:20] offense why they took offense to
[31:23] everything he said you a man making
[31:26] yourself God right so that was the
[31:30] stumbling that's why they stumbled at
[31:33] the very you know he they told him they
[31:35] said we have Moses and I told them it's
[31:38] like I've always said you know we got
[31:40] 1,100 sermons
[31:41] well they walked up to Jesus and they
[31:43] said we got Moses this quote book it's
[31:46] called the Torah we got Moses quote book
[31:49] we got brother Browns quote book didn't
[31:53] do them any good no they didn't know the
[31:55] God that was in that quote book because
[31:57] jesus said if you would have known
[31:59] Abraham if you would have known Moses
[32:03] you would have known me so we have to
[32:08] know something by revelation that we've
[32:12] never seen before
[32:13] we have no promise now sure you say well
[32:18] we don't know in the Old Testament we
[32:20] had no promise Jesus came and brought
[32:23] that promise the promise of the Holy
[32:27] Ghost that's our promise it's to receive
[32:31] the Holy Ghost that's what happened on
[32:32] the day of Pentecost I brought bill Adel
[32:34] was talking about you forming ladder
[32:36] rain what Jesus preached fell on them on
[32:40] the day of Pentecost it had rained on
[32:43] him for three and a half years and then
[32:46] the harvest came there was 120 plants
[32:49] there was 120 plants in the upper room
[32:52] they they were watered for three and a
[32:55] half years but then that last little
[32:58] gusher came from heaven as the sound of
[33:01] a rushing mighty wind and that started
[33:03] your church ages alright then he's got
[33:06] to go back you said what's this got to
[33:08] do the fifth seal you got to remember
[33:10] we're gone so this is this is to the
[33:12] Jews and this is actually this the fifth
[33:15] seal is in another dimension the first
[33:18] four seals worth we've been talking
[33:20] about is that happens in this dementia
[33:23] fifth seal actually happens in another
[33:24] dimension alright so then that what
[33:28] God's got to come back we've got to
[33:29] leave get caught up for him to come back
[33:33] and fulfill that last week to the Jews
[33:35] there all right well that okay to do
[33:39] what to do six things which is the six
[33:42] fold purpose that six fold purpose
[33:45] brings them back just like the sixth
[33:47] eels are bringing me in you to a change
[33:49] of the body it they're obviously gonna
[33:51] take a body change because they're all
[33:53] gonna die and they're gonna be caught up
[33:56] in other words they're gonna be pulled
[33:57] into another dimension okay that all
[34:00] right so now we've got our seven Church
[34:02] ages everybody got that same am alright
[34:05] now the first three ages type the first
[34:09] seal right we'll put this button like
[34:12] seal number one excuse me
[34:16] this one will be number two now remember
[34:20] you got lap over all right three then
[34:25] you lap over and this one will be for
[34:28] cuz they all lap over but to show the
[34:30] first three ages the first seal second
[34:33] seal third seal for sealed now the first
[34:35] seal was what the first seal was a white
[34:38] righteous church or a white horse rider
[34:41] right a wild horse rider rode out in the
[34:45] first three ages so what combated it was
[34:47] a white righteous church that had no
[34:50] denomination no denomination no false
[34:56] doctrine oh yeah that was some it was
[34:58] trying to get in there was there was
[35:00] certain was like Sorrenti us and some of
[35:01] those that were that were bringing in
[35:03] doctrines but you didn't have an
[35:05] established denomination they were
[35:10] beginning but it wasn't established cuz
[35:12] remember because it's the saying a deed
[35:14] and a doctrine it became a saying became
[35:17] a deed and a doctrine in this long
[35:19] church age right here which was that
[35:21] middle one in Columbus time when the
[35:24] Catholic Church took over right right
[35:28] and then so this is white
[35:32] red black and pale we all remember that
[35:41] mmm
[35:42] alright so we got that and this is the
[35:45] dispensation of the Gentile age because
[35:49] remember on the fourth seal we take a
[35:51] rapture on the fourth seal we're caught
[35:54] up so the Gentile age is over on the
[35:58] fourth seal we are living under the
[36:01] anointing of that right now in the
[36:04] fourth seal death and hell will be
[36:08] destroyed because death in hell is what
[36:11] wrote in that Pale Horse death and hell
[36:13] wrote in is alright cuz they come in and
[36:21] see how Satan does he mimics God and he
[36:25] can't come up with anything original
[36:26] bless his heart don't bless his heart he
[36:33] come in as a white righteous church if
[36:36] he would have come in blasting and
[36:37] screaming and and you know you
[36:39] understand what I'm saying people would
[36:41] have said hope wait a minute but he come
[36:45] in with flattery he come with with
[36:47] simplicity and just a well like Sorrenti
[36:50] us you know a serene theist said well
[36:52] now was was Jesus God no I think he was
[36:55] a light substance of God because he
[36:57] couldn't be God because he was a man in
[36:58] him you see all the reasoning that comes
[37:00] into all that well you know what I read
[37:03] yesterday and Iranians run out of the
[37:05] bathhouse that he was in and said I
[37:06] ain't gonna be caught in the same room
[37:08] with that guy another word none I don't
[37:09] want to be in there with that heresy and
[37:12] that heretic idea but you know what that
[37:15] idea didn't die it just kept growing all
[37:18] the others kept growing because right in
[37:20] here see in this right here that's where
[37:27] the denominations were established okay
[37:31] coming out of the cat the Catholics come
[37:32] in and then after the Catholic come in
[37:37] here comes the protesting or the
[37:41] Protestant we've already been through
[37:42] this but just for just the background to
[37:45] get to the fifth seal
[37:46] because the fifth seal is over here the
[37:48] fifth seal is when we're gone but it's
[37:50] in another dimension so we got to talk
[37:52] about this first then we'll get to that
[37:55] but then you've got you read which was
[37:58] white
[37:59] killing 68 million people got killed in
[38:02] this Dark Age Christians so that was a
[38:06] lot a lot of killing okay all right and
[38:09] then he comes out and you say well what
[38:11] you think black would be over here
[38:13] no the black this blackness is the worst
[38:15] blackness this is the time when man
[38:18] comes in and starts making denominations
[38:21] that are totally against God's Word and
[38:24] that remember the scripture we read if
[38:26] if what if your light be darkness how
[38:28] great is that darkness you think you're
[38:31] walking in light but you're totally
[38:33] walking in darkness that's worse than
[38:34] just being in darkness at all and then
[38:37] so that black horse rode in set up
[38:42] denominations and you know what God
[38:44] winked at that because he's got brighten
[38:48] every one of these look they sprite and
[38:50] every one of these ages born-again true
[38:54] believers my brother Nels talking about
[38:56] today Paul comes in starts his reign
[39:01] then he has a harvest without his
[39:04] harvest that's thing about this morning
[39:06] listen to me you'll get something this
[39:08] Paul's harvest was the harvest of souls
[39:13] right Irene is his harvest was the
[39:17] harvest of souls obviously because
[39:20] they're dead in their body their bodies
[39:23] gone but now when we come to here that's
[39:26] why there had to be an eighth
[39:28] manifestation just like what we're
[39:30] talking about somebody this morning when
[39:33] brother Branham comes and sews the form
[39:34] of rain the latter rain is the harvest
[39:39] rain and it's the last one sure he
[39:44] harvested souls no doubt but you can't
[39:48] just keep harvesting Souls and people's
[39:50] keep dying you had to be in the eighth
[39:53] manifestation of God over here at the
[39:55] end of the age right here in this little
[39:58] part
[39:59] when the son of man is to be revealed
[40:02] that there's a body change got to happen
[40:05] so it's not just your soul that he's
[40:07] harvesting and it's brother branham's
[40:09] not doing the harvesting you understand
[40:11] when we put names in here that's God
[40:13] Paul gave nobody the Holy Ghost when he
[40:16] was here
[40:16] Irene escaped nobody the Holy Ghost but
[40:19] you know what he done he directed them
[40:21] to so that God could talk to them under
[40:24] the auspice of that age and the box of
[40:28] that age and they accepted it when they
[40:31] did that put him in the body thereby all
[40:34] right with that put him in the body and
[40:36] then that was the harvest or the latter
[40:38] reign of Paul's teaching Irina's all the
[40:42] way up to even Pentecost and then even
[40:47] brother Branham lapped back over into
[40:49] Pentecost they're starting in 47 to
[40:52] bring a message up to 63 he was
[40:55] established in the faith of the fathers
[40:57] bringing us back to what where they were
[40:59] right here bringing us back to the faith
[41:03] of the fathers here's the faith of the
[41:05] fathers right here those three ages is
[41:08] the faith of fathers right that's funny
[41:11] but see God had to bring us back to that
[41:14] he had to restore the three because he's
[41:18] not going to harvest a stump stump is
[41:22] not going in the rapture know what
[41:24] brother Branham oh he the Cedars on
[41:26] there with the shucks he said the seed
[41:29] is at the end of the memory all your
[41:33] seed is that was at the end of the vine
[41:35] or at the end of wheat goes out and then
[41:38] it matures here's your original seed an
[41:41] apple goes out you got apples hanging at
[41:43] the end of a branch same way with you
[41:45] and I see that's what it is that's what
[41:47] we've come to we've come to that we come
[41:50] back to the fruit again we've come back
[41:52] to where what it'll reproduce itself so
[41:56] in reproducing itself then it's going to
[41:58] come right here and we're going to be
[42:00] caught up so what the harvest of the of
[42:02] the seals that we're about to talk about
[42:05] or that we've been talking about the
[42:06] harvest of the seals is your whole body
[42:08] spare and salt done all right
[42:12] the whole thing whole thing's got to go
[42:14] this time because we'll read a little
[42:19] bit later on we'll read what brother
[42:22] Brown said about not today
[42:23] but we'll read what he said about the
[42:28] souls and so sleeping and all that stuff
[42:31] like that we'll talk about that a little
[42:32] while but not not this survey so
[42:35] everybody okay with that we got church
[42:36] ages we got Gentile churches Satan rides
[42:40] to white horse red horse black horse
[42:42] pale horse this is where we're living in
[42:44] now in the seventh church age right so
[42:51] we're in this and it white red and black
[42:53] together makes pale then we showed that
[42:56] this was more just justification
[43:01] sanctification the whole ego and I'm
[43:06] gonna put right here word made flesh
[43:11] that all right because the culmination
[43:16] of all this is the Word made flesh okay
[43:19] so we type justification white now look
[43:27] everybody okay I'm all right don't worry
[43:30] about me
[43:31] don't worry about me I'll be fine I
[43:33] might have to eat a eat one of these but
[43:36] that's okay I really don't care we're
[43:39] gonna get it done faster sign you don't
[43:41] sign language will get sign language on
[43:43] what stuff you can interpret it Spanish
[43:46] yeah
[43:49] but just now look we went through
[43:53] justification in baby form which chopped
[43:55] off your past sin right sanctification
[43:58] which what drives you unclean spirit out
[44:02] the Holy Ghost is when God comes in
[44:04] burns your old nature out and God
[44:07] Himself the Creator comes in the man
[44:09] that made everything the not a second
[44:11] person or third person but the person of
[44:13] God divides his soul out into you not
[44:17] like that and then you truly do become
[44:21] the Word made flesh but you're a baby
[44:24] you started the baby desire the sincere
[44:28] milk of the word but when we go in
[44:31] talking about these seals is what we've
[44:33] been talking about I hope you could see
[44:35] that that when we went through the force
[44:37] for seals that this is a higher form of
[44:41] justification this is a justification
[44:43] where brother branham covers it I can't
[44:47] remember where he covered it we'll pick
[44:48] it up I'm just going to kind of give you
[44:50] an overview and then we'll come back and
[44:52] read it where this justification is as
[44:54] if you've never done it so this would be
[44:57] as if you come to a revelation that you
[45:02] were trapped into the first part but
[45:07] when you receive the Holy Ghost you come
[45:09] back and I we've talked many times
[45:11] before that you go right on back through
[45:14] justification again when you get into
[45:16] the pyramid so we come to sanctification
[45:18] what is sanctification clean and set
[45:21] aside for service what the brother
[45:22] branham's when he saw the vision of
[45:24] sister Shepherd what happened there was
[45:27] water bringing trash out trash now
[45:32] you're already born again but there's
[45:37] got to be a sanctifying process in this
[45:39] statue of a perfect man that burns out
[45:41] the air that gets all the trash out amen
[45:52] so statue a perfect man Colette's to me
[46:00] that's the sanctifying process you
[46:02] already got the baptism the Holy Ghost
[46:04] in the baby form your baby right down
[46:05] here and you born babe in Christ then
[46:07] you grow you realize this as you've ever
[46:11] done it and then you realize every
[46:14] Sunday and every wings you and every
[46:16] time you match play and every time you
[46:17] meditate that God is cleaning up
[46:20] you don't just automatically these are
[46:22] just lines of reference okay folks these
[46:25] are just lines of reference because God
[46:27] don't just pour virtue in you and it
[46:29] fills that whole line up I wished it was
[46:32] that way right since about I wished it
[46:35] was that way
[46:37] I really wished it was that way I know I
[46:42] know but it's not it's not that way let
[46:45] me do some housecleaning here it's not
[46:48] that way it's just those lines can be
[46:52] just like England if it's your life like
[46:54] my life these lines are going like this
[46:57] on the inside you get a little bit of
[47:00] godliness and then you get a little bit
[47:01] of this and then you get a little bit
[47:03] laughs but you sell them in though you
[47:06] know when you got verse you
[47:07] you know when the knowledge the
[47:10] temperance the patience the godliness
[47:13] there's there's no you're not standing
[47:15] there and God's filled up this much of
[47:17] you and then he filled this much and
[47:19] then he fills up this much no it's a
[47:22] daily walk with God it's a daily
[47:24] realization I mean how many of you have
[47:27] come from a place that when you were
[47:30] born again who was that me and Joe so
[47:32] much things remember what we were just
[47:34] telling man Joseph said brother Joseph
[47:37] Canada resting right back there he's 45
[47:43] 42 he told me a few minutes ago he said
[47:46] you know what he said when I was younger
[47:48] things bothered me he said now that I'm
[47:52] 40-something years old he said they
[47:53] don't bother me as much as they used to
[47:55] I see you where do you get 58 and 60 and
[48:00] 70 and 80 those things are become very
[48:03] frivolous they become nothing right
[48:06] well that's the way it is with God you
[48:09] say well no that's not yeah it is that's
[48:11] the way you grow you grow up in the
[48:15] things that you used to do you don't do
[48:17] them no more but the things that used to
[48:20] bother you sure they come to you but
[48:22] they don't bother you as much and then
[48:26] but remember God is not a granddaddy
[48:29] because when we become grandparents we
[48:31] let everything go if a grandkid does it
[48:35] it's cute that's just the way it is
[48:37] right Josh just get some mad at me he
[48:43] said daddy you to never let me do that
[48:45] when I was younger what if I'd have done
[48:46] that I said you would have not lived to
[48:48] have that green car
[48:49] Renshaw but because she does it it's
[48:53] wonderful she just took a pen one day
[48:56] and got my hunting magazines and she
[48:58] just I mean she went but about three she
[49:01] just drew tore pages throat stuff
[49:03] everywhere in my hunting magazines and
[49:05] you don't do that much but she did and
[49:08] it was cute so I didn't mind it but Josh
[49:09] tried to kill him so God's not a grande
[49:17] to let you get by with everything but he
[49:19] is a father that wants you to grow up
[49:21] and then you go huh that used to bother
[49:25] you sighing they don't bother you
[49:26] anymore does it
[49:27] right same way with God if you can't see
[49:31] if you can't see how God deals with you
[49:33] by the way you by the way you are you
[49:36] ain't got the whole ego you ain't got
[49:38] the Holy Ghost if you can't see how God
[49:40] how you deal in your natural life and
[49:43] how that God lays right over the top of
[49:45] that and deals with you basically the
[49:47] same way cuz we're all we're all
[49:49] different you know what
[49:52] some of y'all wouldn't even have a
[49:53] hunting magazine in your house so you
[49:55] can't relate to what I'm saying
[49:57] but maybe Good Housekeeping maybe
[49:59] Popular Mechanics maybe some other
[50:02] magazine but it's the same principle the
[50:07] kid tearing the thing up same way with
[50:10] God
[50:10] basically he deals with all of us the
[50:12] same way because it's in his word
[50:15] because that's the way we live and
[50:17] that's the way he deals with us by the
[50:19] way we live I just believe that that way
[50:22] it becomes more personal to me
[50:24] it becomes person that I know God's
[50:26] dealing with me okay alright so we see
[50:32] justification as if you never done it
[50:34] sanctification in the statute of a
[50:36] perfect man
[50:37] cleaning the trash out red what red is
[50:41] always sanctifying Red's keeping us
[50:44] clean member brother Brown said you're
[50:46] not saved by the blood you're kept save
[50:50] your kept saved by the blood you can't
[50:53] get unsaved but you can get kept saved
[50:56] by the blood throwing all that trash out
[51:00] all right say man
[51:05] now we're talking about the Holy Ghost
[51:08] here but let's put all another one in
[51:10] here y'all can't see in the back that
[51:12] says adoption because you come here and
[51:17] you're getting up this statue of a
[51:19] perfect man to where God can use you and
[51:21] then remember the Prophet said he seals
[51:23] all that in he seals it in with what the
[51:25] Holy Ghost the same Holy Ghost that you
[51:27] got when you as a baby but now you've
[51:29] come to more maturity he's been able to
[51:31] to offer you things and you treat him
[51:35] right he didn't offer you the car keys
[51:39] at the bottom of the pyramid amen but
[51:43] now once you get older he'll hand you
[51:46] the keys to whatever vehicle you that he
[51:49] has for you to use that all right that's
[51:54] just pretty simple that's what makes the
[51:56] seal so simple to me it's just the onion
[51:59] peel you just keep peeling it back now
[52:03] we come right here to where we've come
[52:06] here to where these a few things got to
[52:09] happen remember I gave you the four
[52:11] things death is destroyed death was not
[52:15] destroyed right here except in your soul
[52:22] got it
[52:23] that's not destroyed in your body and
[52:26] your spirit right here but what about
[52:29] praise God that you come up here to
[52:31] adoption and where does adoption work
[52:33] through I believe it works through the
[52:36] spirit realm your memory reason
[52:41] conscience affection imagination cast
[52:44] down those things get rid of them get
[52:46] the knowledge of God the temperance of
[52:48] God the patience of God the godliness of
[52:49] God brotherly kindness of God all right
[52:53] you didn't have that when you were here
[52:57] potential you received the spirit of
[53:00] adoption whereby you cry daddy daddy cry
[53:04] father Abba Father but when you come
[53:07] around here you gotta quit cryin
[53:11] if you're still crying you're still
[53:12] right here we got to start believing
[53:15] what God's already done for us not what
[53:18] he's going to do what he's already done
[53:21] for us he's equipped you for your whole
[53:24] sea this is yeah I hope you hope you get
[53:28] this before I pass out this right here
[53:34] is your whole journey as a Christian
[53:38] right there that's your whole journey
[53:42] everything you do say breathe talk
[53:45] listen here
[53:47] memorize everything is right here in
[53:50] these in this four seals because it's in
[53:54] this dimension it happens right here
[53:57] everybody got that
[53:59] it happens right here cuz look even your
[54:04] body change is in this right here it
[54:09] can't come any other way they can't help
[54:13] you they can't help you they can't help
[54:15] you they can't help you they can't help
[54:17] you they can't help you and 99% of them
[54:21] can't help you they're already gone
[54:25] they're going on they can't help you
[54:28] they're in another dimension waiting on
[54:32] you to bring them to this dimension amen
[54:35] they're in another dimension they've
[54:37] already went they went through whatever
[54:39] stages in all this they went through but
[54:42] they have never went through this stage
[54:44] yet the body's changing death destroyed
[54:48] that's why you and I wife spent so much
[54:50] time on that force field because we must
[54:53] realize that the resurrection and the
[54:56] body change lies in you and I the voice
[55:00] of the resurrection will come through
[55:02] the bride of Jesus Christ and you know
[55:07] what you know what this proves I already
[55:10] told you this two or three thousand
[55:11] times this proves right here that we
[55:15] don't go through the tribulation because
[55:18] the Tribulation Period is right here
[55:21] you and I take a rapture bodycheck talk
[55:25] about a change and a resurrection it all
[55:27] happens right here we don't go through
[55:31] the tribulation period if your bride I
[55:34] don't care if you pass away today and
[55:36] you're just right here as a newborn babe
[55:40] in Christ you will never die never can
[55:44] die never will die your flesh will stop
[55:48] producing and they'll put you in the
[55:50] grave the firing mechanism has left the
[55:56] electricity has left the building so
[55:59] that's what you are your soul is your
[56:01] electricity you know that's what we are
[56:03] right that's why they see them we have
[56:09] x-rays x-rays proves there's something
[56:12] in there besides you
[56:13] it shows bone and all that other stuff
[56:16] but there's a reflection somewhere
[56:18] coming off of that there's a firing
[56:23] mechanism what makes my end do that now
[56:26] if my theophany was not in me it would
[56:28] be and that'd be it it would never move
[56:31] again right so it's the fired mechanism
[56:36] your soul is your firing mechanism
[56:37] that's what keeps your heart pumping
[56:43] hello
[56:47] but that fire mechanism of those just
[56:51] passed on is over in another dimension
[56:53] and they're waiting to come back here
[56:56] and get back in that same body so just
[56:58] start working again but it won't be like
[57:01] this that's beginning to happen to me
[57:06] don't worry
[57:07] after about 15,000 pieces of mail a week
[57:11] that old hand right there kind of goes
[57:14] my dexterity has left the building
[57:17] but you know what they're over there on
[57:21] the other side brother Robert Tatum he's
[57:24] not over there with his hand all turned
[57:26] over to the side like this no he's got
[57:28] 20 year old hands and he's over there
[57:30] talking to Gary Adkins and all the ones
[57:32] that have went on that we know we know
[57:34] because they're here you know we're
[57:36] sitting here brother mr. Marlow all the
[57:38] ones lord of mercy charlotte gives me
[57:42] gave me a reminder not too long ago
[57:44] every time I put on a tie I think of
[57:48] Richard that man could put together
[57:51] I can't do stripes in circles and Prince
[57:58] Richard could do stripes and circles and
[58:01] prints and Reds and dark green and
[58:03] blacks and purple and he put them all
[58:05] together you go wow that looks good if I
[58:07] put him on you go who did that was the
[58:11] room dark when you put that out right
[58:14] Charlotte so she gives me this big box
[58:16] with like 150 times the guests so every
[58:20] time I get in that Thai box and you give
[58:22] me this one but I was trying to pick out
[58:24] some more but you know what there's our
[58:26] connection
[58:27] they walked among us they're part of us
[58:31] they're more part of us now because they
[58:36] had a human life they they they work
[58:38] through now they're all together in one
[58:41] place and they're all going come on
[58:44] people come on people hurry up because
[58:48] remember we're gonna get into where
[58:50] they're saying how long how long but not
[58:54] this fifth seal people listen up we got
[58:56] to separate that that all right we got
[58:59] to separate that because
[59:00] this right here is bride bride material
[59:06] and this is the bride of Jesus Christ
[59:09] now none of this is on either side
[59:15] Israel's not nothing is not his bride
[59:19] remember he divorced her in the Old
[59:21] Testament can't be that no more their
[59:24] servants they're gonna be giving the
[59:26] whole ego but they're not getting this
[59:28] cuz you know what we have to have faith
[59:31] for every bit of this you know what why
[59:34] did brother Branham what what if he was
[59:36] an impostor what if they broke these
[59:37] books and we don't know where in the
[59:38] world this come from but you know why I
[59:41] know it's right because what's inside of
[59:44] me
[59:45] rings out with what's on this page that
[59:49] firing mechanism that I got that God
[59:51] recharged about twenty years ago took
[59:56] the old one out and put the new one in
[59:58] it agrees with this so I know it
[1:00:01] happened how you know Jesus walked the
[1:00:03] face of the earth how do you know that
[1:00:05] you never seen him ain't no picture
[1:00:07] that's the closest one
[1:00:08] but God give us a prophet to say hey
[1:00:11] that looked like him so at least we kind
[1:00:14] of narrowed it down
[1:00:15] did he give us the Prophet to say Eve
[1:00:18] was blunt headed and blue-eyed no it's
[1:00:25] not what he said that's what he saw and
[1:00:27] then he told us I told him this morning
[1:00:31] I said anything I don't care what the
[1:00:33] Prophet said anything
[1:00:35] you can't put faith in and put it in the
[1:00:37] word is hearsay right it's hearsay
[1:00:42] that's what the that's what the
[1:00:45] Pharisees and Sadducees couldn't get
[1:00:47] over it was all hearsay to them but the
[1:00:50] one that said it was standing in front
[1:00:52] of them that's what's gonna happen today
[1:00:54] the one that said it has got to be here
[1:00:57] the one that said it has got to be in
[1:01:00] control then we know it's right then we
[1:01:03] don't have to pick quotes to fight quote
[1:01:09] we know we had to speak to the Prophet I
[1:01:11] believed William Brennan was a prophet I
[1:01:14] believe he told us the absolute truth
[1:01:16] but if we can't if the one inside of me
[1:01:25] can't agree with it it's hearsay the
[1:01:31] only thing you've got is a revelation a
[1:01:33] revelation is not hearsay when brother
[1:01:36] Brad went across the curtain of time
[1:01:38] before he went across the curtain of
[1:01:39] time it was hearsay wasn't it what have
[1:01:44] you always heard of your life boy you
[1:01:47] know Uncle Joe he's walking with Jesus
[1:01:49] on the streets to go nice a lot when I
[1:01:52] was what we heard in there right mama
[1:01:54] sitting at the feet of Jesus right now
[1:01:56] that's all we heard walking the streets
[1:02:00] to go right well that's always a lie
[1:02:03] according to brother Branham and I
[1:02:06] believe he saw it he didn't get it
[1:02:08] wasn't hearsay God sent him over there
[1:02:10] to come back and tell us he's sent him
[1:02:13] to the promised land he sent us to the
[1:02:18] promised land by a prophet with a vision
[1:02:21] and I don't believe too much about a
[1:02:24] vision I believe he went there that
[1:02:27] fired mechanism went over there and
[1:02:31] because they hugged him that's why we're
[1:02:35] gonna see in this fifth seal if we would
[1:02:39] have just paid attention to the Bible
[1:02:41] the Bible said down in another dimension
[1:02:44] they cried with a loud voice
[1:02:48] they weren't over there like brother Ram
[1:02:50] thought you know many times he talked
[1:02:52] you know brother Nevel just floating on
[1:02:54] a cloud remember we all were going to
[1:02:56] play harps and float on a cloud right
[1:03:00] that was hearsay it's not hearsay
[1:03:04] anymore we have proof what the problem
[1:03:10] is is 210 line preachers that went over
[1:03:13] into the promised land
[1:03:16] remember I preached that sermon but what
[1:03:18] about 15 years ago I still have people
[1:03:21] when I go to root they go I enjoyed them
[1:03:23] by a priest on 10 line preachers because
[1:03:25] there was 12 people went across the
[1:03:27] promised land they're also same thing
[1:03:29] they brought back evidence and 10 of
[1:03:34] them said we can't take it they God
[1:03:38] that's our problem
[1:03:39] The Lying preachers in this message have
[1:03:42] kept us here there was only 2 that
[1:03:48] believed and God had to wait till all
[1:03:51] them other preachers is dead for them
[1:03:53] too
[1:03:54] amen to take them across in the promised
[1:03:56] land that all right
[1:04:00] death has got to be destroyed
[1:04:02] that's a reality that's not hearsay you
[1:04:08] hear me I don't mind people saying
[1:04:11] brother Brown sin that's fine but I'm
[1:04:14] like brother Clark why singer says why
[1:04:15] do we have to get up and read 45 quotes
[1:04:18] why can't we just preach it out of the
[1:04:20] revelation of our own faith adding those
[1:04:22] in because 90% of the time we're quoting
[1:04:24] either brother Branham of the Bible why
[1:04:29] do I have to say 1950s 65 while we are
[1:04:34] not a denomination nothing why do I have
[1:04:36] to read that why for weak people for
[1:04:43] weak people trying to convince some of
[1:04:45] certain things no you can't convince
[1:04:49] somebody this it's got to be a personal
[1:04:52] revelation with God
[1:04:55] because as hearsay hearsay will hold up
[1:04:58] in court
[1:05:00] but an eyewitness will show up in court
[1:05:04] and say I saw well I'm gonna tell you
[1:05:07] today I saw these seals open I see them
[1:05:11] open and I see what it's doing to a
[1:05:14] group of people it's not hearsay death
[1:05:24] is destroyed by our belief not in a
[1:05:31] Torah not in all this other stuff but
[1:05:35] what Jesus did what he sent that little
[1:05:38] prophet to break this thing down to us
[1:05:42] cuz you got to remember - now I not
[1:05:45] belittling brother branham at all none
[1:05:47] you hear me he preached the seals seven
[1:05:50] nights I was looking in the I was
[1:05:55] looking in the things over there he
[1:05:57] never mentions the fifth seal except in
[1:06:00] the fifth seal and a few times before
[1:06:01] never mentions it again in the message
[1:06:04] now the sixth seal he mentioned it
[1:06:06] because it does a lot with the
[1:06:07] Tribulation Period
[1:06:07] he never mentions hardly mentions the
[1:06:10] seals after he preaches them hardly ever
[1:06:13] mentions Daniel 7 two weeks after he
[1:06:15] preaches them why because once it's
[1:06:17] preached once it's open it's for me and
[1:06:20] you to take it's for me and you to break
[1:06:25] it down to other people break it down to
[1:06:26] each other
[1:06:27] break it down like this and have 15
[1:06:30] sermons on the fourth seal brother Ram
[1:06:32] said I can't do that I don't have time
[1:06:35] but was it gift to us or did he put it
[1:06:41] in his in a little book and carry back
[1:06:43] with him
[1:06:43] no he opened it and it stayed open and
[1:06:49] it's still open and it's not hearsay
[1:06:53] does you know what if you shut the book
[1:06:56] it's hearsay because I can't read it but
[1:06:59] if I can read it in the book that's not
[1:07:02] hearsay that's something I can see
[1:07:08] so there's your four seals hey all right
[1:07:10] now look I'm gonna make this statement
[1:07:16] and I'm gonna then I'm gonna write the
[1:07:17] fifth seal down we're gonna talk about
[1:07:19] just for a few minutes cuz I wanted to
[1:07:20] get this out of the way now the first
[1:07:25] four seals is the in actuality what
[1:07:29] happens because we leave right here and
[1:07:32] we're not seeing anymore until it's kind
[1:07:35] of strange that we go up in revelations
[1:07:37] chapter what kind of strange would go up
[1:07:46] Revelation chapter 4 we will go up on
[1:07:48] the fourth seat that strange that a coin
[1:07:52] sir I don't think so
[1:07:54] but we go up in Revelations for one and
[1:07:56] um we're not say until 1924 so
[1:08:02] revelations four we're caught up and
[1:08:05] then then it then God starts dealing
[1:08:08] with the Jews but we have to get the
[1:08:10] spiritual part of it so the four seals
[1:08:15] that we've been talking about if we take
[1:08:19] a rapture then that's been destroyed all
[1:08:22] these things that we've been talking
[1:08:23] about so this is actual belief what
[1:08:26] happens and it shows you what happened
[1:08:31] but now you say well once we got five
[1:08:34] six and seven let's just throw them away
[1:08:36] and give them to the Jews
[1:08:39] we got to have all of them I mean I'll
[1:08:44] bring you a quote next Sunday brother
[1:08:46] Graham says six seals finishes
[1:08:47] Redemption so we got to come too right
[1:08:49] here under here so we got lap this back
[1:08:56] over this way
[1:08:58] hey all right with that
[1:09:00] we got a we'll have it back over and go
[1:09:04] five six seven because we got to have
[1:09:12] them all this and the Seventh Seal what
[1:09:13] brother Graham said Seventh Seal brings
[1:09:15] Christ back to the earth they okay five
[1:09:27] six and seven it's too legit enough five
[1:09:29] is in another dimension sixth seal comes
[1:09:33] back into this dimension during the
[1:09:34] Tribulation Period so we know we're not
[1:09:36] here all right in the seventh seal the
[1:09:39] seventh trumpet is the same as the
[1:09:41] seventh seal kingdom of our Lord has
[1:09:44] been come to king of what Christ comes
[1:09:46] in fights for the Jews everything's done
[1:09:48] and over with and then we go into the
[1:09:50] Millennium still under this because it's
[1:09:54] Christ in us going on into the
[1:09:56] Millennium thereby alright with that
[1:09:58] alright so we got a little out this back
[1:10:01] over now and start talking about the
[1:10:03] fifth seal there by alright you see that
[1:10:06] so we got to look at this one through
[1:10:09] four tells us what happened five six and
[1:10:12] seven is going to show you exactly how
[1:10:14] it happened
[1:10:16] everybody all right with that five six
[1:10:19] and seven is going to show you and I how
[1:10:22] this one two three four happens because
[1:10:24] the fifth seal is a great seal why would
[1:10:29] 5 be the number of grace
[1:10:33] not a coincidence again and what does
[1:10:39] this 5th seal do it's not as if you
[1:10:41] never did it it's the real you never did
[1:10:44] it
[1:10:47] never did it because without that and
[1:10:53] without this and without this you're not
[1:10:56] gonna take a buddy Jenny but you do take
[1:10:59] it here that's why it's kind of
[1:11:00] confusing to be careful but you got to
[1:11:02] take five six and seven and lap them
[1:11:04] back here because look we're gone right
[1:11:06] here all seals are broke to the Gentiles
[1:11:12] to the Gentiles while we're still here
[1:11:15] because there's no one else saved after
[1:11:18] here this is Gentile they mean nothing
[1:11:21] to these any none of these seals mean
[1:11:23] anything to these people that go through
[1:11:25] the tribulation only that we made it and
[1:11:29] they may have a chance from knowing us
[1:11:33] because the foolish virgin doesn't get
[1:11:35] any of this sure they get sanctified but
[1:11:38] they get baby sanctification right is
[1:11:43] that okay they're not confusing you they
[1:11:45] get me they're not saying to fight up
[1:11:47] here they're sanctified right here they
[1:11:50] never come to that faith to receive the
[1:11:53] Holy Ghost if they receive the Holy
[1:11:55] Ghost then that puts them in our group
[1:11:57] and they're not foolish virgins but
[1:12:01] remember they're virgins to the Word of
[1:12:03] God they have cleaned their self up but
[1:12:08] they never went on to the Holy Ghost you
[1:12:10] know why a lot of times that happened
[1:12:11] I'm gonna just tell you this there's
[1:12:17] gonna be a lot of foolish virgins in
[1:12:18] this message because the preachers that
[1:12:21] preach and got to holy go and if you
[1:12:25] ain't got the Holy Ghost you can't go no
[1:12:27] higher in your pastor they'll tell you
[1:12:30] it's this they'll tell you it speaking
[1:12:31] in tongues bleed brother Brown was a
[1:12:32] prophet that's gonna be the worst one
[1:12:39] listen those people didn't only believe
[1:12:41] Moses was a prophet they knew he was
[1:12:44] because they had his Torah right there
[1:12:46] in their hand God told them to do the
[1:12:49] temple things of the temple and the very
[1:12:52] temple was standing there and they
[1:12:55] missed him
[1:12:55] same thing now same thing now God has
[1:12:59] sent this
[1:13:00] listen I told you the other day the son
[1:13:03] of man revelation will also bring the
[1:13:10] the son of man three-and-a-half-year
[1:13:12] revelation go back to Matthew Mark Luke
[1:13:14] and John and read it look what the
[1:13:16] highest form of religious world did to
[1:13:19] Jesus and that's what they're gonna do
[1:13:23] to anybody that is the Son of Man the
[1:13:27] bride what so what's the highest
[1:13:31] religious form in the old world what we
[1:13:34] say randomized randomized they know
[1:13:38] everything they know it all they know
[1:13:42] everything it is they all they know it
[1:13:43] all
[1:13:44] well I don't want to know it all I just
[1:13:49] want to know him all if I know him all I
[1:13:56] don't have to be a know-it-all you want
[1:14:01] to put that down and hope that you can
[1:14:03] that's not copyrighted you can come if
[1:14:05] you want you write it down man that's
[1:14:08] okay you write that down interpret that
[1:14:10] in Spanish but you know we always lay
[1:14:16] heavy on the Son of Man we know that the
[1:14:18] Son of Man anointing is here but that
[1:14:20] same anointing that combated him was
[1:14:21] here too we don't we don't talk about
[1:14:24] that sometime but that same anointing
[1:14:26] that caused the son of man to come on
[1:14:28] the scene and do what he did is all
[1:14:30] around him who was it the religious
[1:14:33] world who's gonna come down on us the
[1:14:36] Baptist Methodist no no no it'll be the
[1:14:42] people in our own right Judas was in
[1:14:45] Jesus's range wouldn't had part of the
[1:14:49] ministry one of them 10 line preacher
[1:14:53] but the fifth seal that we're fixing to
[1:14:55] talk about I'm gonna read you a few
[1:14:56] quotes and we'll be finished we're gonna
[1:14:59] have to see that this grace we look at
[1:15:02] the fifth seal and we're gonna break it
[1:15:03] down later then it is souls under the
[1:15:05] altar cry how long how long then we know
[1:15:07] how that who that is that's the Jews
[1:15:08] under Eichmann and Hitler
[1:15:11] but there's a lot of things that goes
[1:15:12] with that but when we see that it's
[1:15:15] growing out what happened what is the
[1:15:16] whole pretense of the fifth seal God
[1:15:18] gives eternal life to a group of people
[1:15:20] that doesn't want it didn't that mean
[1:15:25] you mean you I mean did you just grow up
[1:15:30] one day and say I want eternal life no
[1:15:33] God had to come to you hey boy
[1:15:36] that's far enough your mind your mind
[1:15:44] hey let me get your attention and that's
[1:15:49] what he done around here and then now
[1:15:50] we've come to a place that we look and
[1:15:52] see right here because remember he
[1:15:59] didn't have to deal with the real you
[1:16:00] never done it
[1:16:01] his real you never don't need to start
[1:16:03] with but we're born in sin we're saving
[1:16:06] an iniquity we'd come under a little bit
[1:16:08] different part right but he still had to
[1:16:14] deal with memory reason conscious
[1:16:17] defense and imagination because remember
[1:16:19] the Bible said that when he was out in
[1:16:21] the wilderness the devil came to him and
[1:16:23] tempted him he has been tempted by the
[1:16:25] devil
[1:16:26] in his mind the whole time he was alive
[1:16:30] he was not exempt from that but you what
[1:16:34] he done he done what we don't do he
[1:16:37] right but he does he never dwelt on any
[1:16:41] of that now that's the son of man so
[1:16:45] that's what you and I gotta come to the
[1:16:50] prince of this world has come and has
[1:16:53] nothing in me now you say well now now
[1:16:57] in a way well now in a way that's the
[1:16:59] devil if you're gone in a way that's the
[1:17:03] devil you're either God Almighty in
[1:17:05] human flesh are you the devil almighty
[1:17:07] in human flesh that was quiet
[1:17:12] right there's no gray area then when you
[1:17:15] get into this you get born again then
[1:17:19] God starts working as if you never done
[1:17:22] it you come to a place that not only God
[1:17:24] destroyed your past but he's destroying
[1:17:28] every day that you do something that you
[1:17:30] asked forgiveness for keeping you clean
[1:17:34] by the blood at sanctification that
[1:17:36] statue of a perfect man is burning all
[1:17:38] that out then you come to adoption it
[1:17:44] won't be a bunch of babies that's the
[1:17:48] body change can't happen can't happen
[1:17:53] cannot happen all right so let's read
[1:17:58] this here just for a second well reads
[1:17:59] what brother brings in so we got the
[1:18:01] fifth seal six himself said we got a
[1:18:02] laughing back under here so that we get
[1:18:04] all this so that gives all seven seals
[1:18:06] to you and means that all right well
[1:18:08] that'd be okay with that then we come to
[1:18:10] this grace that we were a group of
[1:18:12] people that didn't want it because look
[1:18:18] this words gonna get sticky God blinded
[1:18:22] the eyes of that group of people right
[1:18:24] here let's look right here look the
[1:18:26] fifth seal Jew he literally blinded
[1:18:31] their eyes and said you can't see Who I
[1:18:34] am you know why he blinded their eyes
[1:18:36] for me and you so that this could happen
[1:18:41] I feel good now but that's what he gave
[1:18:49] us he literally blinded because you know
[1:18:52] what they would have accepted him he
[1:18:55] came that he came the exact way that the
[1:18:58] Old Testament said he would come Jesus
[1:19:01] said what part of this do you not
[1:19:03] understand I've done everything that the
[1:19:09] Bible told he said but you can't see me
[1:19:16] but I'm gonna give you eternal life
[1:19:19] for something I did cuz he's got he can
[1:19:24] do that I'm gonna give him eternal they
[1:19:27] don't even what's the same thing what
[1:19:28] happened to us when we were born in
[1:19:30] seeing shaping the neck we come to this
[1:19:31] world speaking lies what happened hello
[1:19:38] we were blinded to the things of God
[1:19:42] then all of a sudden one day he goes hey
[1:19:45] it's me hola and now we come though when
[1:19:53] we get all these things right in the
[1:19:57] order we must because we'll never take a
[1:20:00] body change if we don't no no not here
[1:20:03] say that the real you never did it this
[1:20:07] is not the real you
[1:20:09] so what's inside never done it never
[1:20:12] done it never sinned a day in his life
[1:20:16] because God had to literally blind them
[1:20:19] but you know what God had to do to he'd
[1:20:21] put his out hand over his own eyes cuz
[1:20:24] if he sees sin he must destroy it so he
[1:20:29] covered his own eyes for two thousand
[1:20:32] years so that means you can come in what
[1:20:37] kind of grace is that now I'm telling us
[1:20:39] what I said there's no way man could
[1:20:41] come up with that word no way you and I
[1:20:45] are too judgmental oh well I am and
[1:20:49] y'all are not then well thank God we're
[1:20:54] not God yeah that's right under that yes
[1:21:00] but we're judgmental in our humanity
[1:21:04] everybody raise your hand everybody
[1:21:07] raise your hand that's how many people
[1:21:11] are judgmental right but what is grapes
[1:21:18] do oh yeah if you're not under this
[1:21:20] you're judged but God can't judge you
[1:21:23] right here and you received the Holy
[1:21:26] Ghost he can't judge that fired
[1:21:27] mechanism because it's him
[1:21:31] he can't judge himself he's already been
[1:21:34] judged and it wasn't his soul that was
[1:21:37] judged he gave his soul ransom he gave
[1:21:43] his body a sacrifice he gave us all a
[1:21:46] ransom so what he can ransom you that's
[1:21:53] why I'm telling you you never lose them
[1:21:57] that's why I said people go with one of
[1:21:59] the seals the cells have got to be the
[1:22:01] plan of redemption everything we talked
[1:22:03] about is the redemption of man all the
[1:22:06] way to every cell all this is Redemption
[1:22:09] we wouldn't need this if we were dead in
[1:22:12] trespasses and sin but we need this but
[1:22:16] once we come to realization if you don't
[1:22:19] realize the real you never done it
[1:22:20] you'll be so condemned you can't take a
[1:22:22] body change but the only body changes
[1:22:25] gonna be to buy this bottle that man
[1:22:27] standing right there the seventh seal is

[1:25:17] connection with these people they were
[1:25:19] there during the time of the opening the
[1:25:22] seal now I want to give thanks to him
[1:25:26] who's I'm the present look and that
[1:25:28] today not knowing one thing about that
[1:25:31] fifth seal it came in that same
[1:25:34] mysterious way this morning just about
[1:25:36] an hour before daybreak then when I was
[1:25:39] out praying so brother branham when he
[1:25:41] comes to that fifth seal he realizes he
[1:25:44] better put his notes to the side
[1:25:48] all seal 1 through 4 he said I looked on
[1:25:51] my whole notes and I was gonna preach
[1:25:52] this I looked on my old notes and I was
[1:25:54] gonna preach this I looked on my old
[1:25:55] notes he said buddy came a holy hole
[1:25:57] totally different way okay I'm just
[1:26:01] telling you what he said not knowing one
[1:26:04] thing about that fifth seal it came in a
[1:26:09] same material mysterious way this
[1:26:11] morning hour before daybreak
[1:26:12] all right school number three number
[1:26:16] three now this is rather a mysterious
[1:26:18] and now for the sake of tapes and
[1:26:19] clergymen and teachers descending
[1:26:21] present that's us now if you have a
[1:26:23] different view of this I did too but I'm
[1:26:27] just taking it from the inspiration
[1:26:29] which completely changed my view of it
[1:26:32] see and we'll read what he said what he
[1:26:35] thought it was and then I find out as
[1:26:38] you see these revealed it's taking right
[1:26:41] back and bringing those Church ages see
[1:26:44] look so this has got to happen to us in
[1:26:48] the church ages to us all right and the
[1:26:56] scripture right together tying it up and
[1:26:58] that's the reason I believe that it
[1:27:00] comes from God he depended a lot on him
[1:27:02] Church ages Denny
[1:27:03] number four this is paragraph 69 notice
[1:27:08] there's no mention of another beast or a
[1:27:10] living creature to this announcement of
[1:27:12] the fifth seal now remember that was on
[1:27:14] the fourth seal that was on the first
[1:27:16] seal second seal third seal fourth seal
[1:27:18] but none here now we've been through
[1:27:19] some of these but I just brought them to
[1:27:21] bring them back to your attention now
[1:27:23] this is a pretty long reading but
[1:27:24] there's only two quotes left and we'll
[1:27:26] be done we've been a little bit about an
[1:27:28] hour all right number five fifth seal
[1:27:31] now notice I love this at the time of
[1:27:33] the writers of the four horses the rider
[1:27:34] I'm gonna let him explain what I just
[1:27:36] explained kind of of the four different
[1:27:39] horses there was a beast that announced
[1:27:41] the power every time the rider straddled
[1:27:43] another horse and came forth to ride
[1:27:45] another kind of beast came out and
[1:27:47] announced it that's a great mystery
[1:27:51] what you talking about the line ox man
[1:27:52] and eagle the holy ghost in the church
[1:27:55] age is working through the people not
[1:27:57] all right
[1:27:58] that's a great mystery see that is the
[1:28:01] mystery why announcing the mystery why
[1:28:05] isn't there one here on the fifth seal
[1:28:07] to announce it here it is according to
[1:28:10] the revelation that the Lord Jesus gave
[1:28:12] me today see our this morning early that
[1:28:15] is that the mystery of the church ages
[1:28:17] are already finished at this time let's
[1:28:21] scroll it up the mystery of the
[1:28:25] Antichrist is revealed at this time the
[1:28:29] Antichrist took his last ride and we
[1:28:31] found him on the pale horse mixed with
[1:28:34] many colors and rods all the way into
[1:28:36] British perdition we get it on the
[1:28:38] trumpets and so forth when we teach that
[1:28:40] getting plumb off the subject and we go
[1:28:42] he rides that's the reason there's no
[1:28:44] one there now we know written because
[1:28:47] some reasons for something we know
[1:28:49] written cuz some reasons for something
[1:28:51] now you remember at the first beginning
[1:28:53] I said there can't be nothing without a
[1:28:55] reason remember the little drop of ain't
[1:28:57] that you've got to find the reason there
[1:29:00] was a reason they didn't have to have a
[1:29:02] beast or a power to announce this still
[1:29:04] being broke and only God can reveal why
[1:29:07] that's all because it all lays in him in
[1:29:11] other words nobody else's revelation had
[1:29:14] ever been right just what he just said
[1:29:18] nobody else's revelations been right but
[1:29:21] he's fixing to tell you but the reason
[1:29:24] that he reveals that I as I understand
[1:29:27] that is because the mystery of the book
[1:29:30] of redemption as far as the Antichrist
[1:29:33] being revealed at the same time the
[1:29:35] church is gone and these things don't
[1:29:37] even happen in the church ages at all
[1:29:39] how about the fifth seal that's right
[1:29:42] there away from the church age the
[1:29:44] church absolutely is raptured at this
[1:29:46] time the church goes up at the fourth
[1:29:49] chapter revelation does not return until
[1:29:51] it comes back with its King in the
[1:29:53] nineteenth chapter but
[1:29:57] but cuz you know what the seals are in
[1:30:03] Chapter what six and eight revelations
[1:30:09] tens in there in between all that right
[1:30:12] so we just need to kick it all out erase
[1:30:14] it out of your Bible cuz it's not to us
[1:30:16] I don't think so the only way we get to
[1:30:20] revelations 19 is what's in between
[1:30:23] revelations five is what
[1:30:25] there's your grace there's your
[1:30:29] Redemption chapter revelation five right
[1:30:31] the church absolutely wait a minute yeah
[1:30:34] the church absolutely is raptured I miss
[1:30:37] something what'd I miss
[1:30:40] we're my Oh for chapter right thank you
[1:30:43] Joe thank you does not return until it
[1:30:45] comes back with its king in a nineteen
[1:30:47] chapter but these cells here are
[1:30:49] revealing what has been what is and what
[1:30:54] will be now he covered every bit of it
[1:30:57] right there see and now what was to be
[1:31:03] for the church age was revealed by these
[1:31:06] seals not just four of them all of them
[1:31:08] and now watch what takes place the four
[1:31:10] stages of his rider has been revealed
[1:31:13] the four stages of the Antichrist riding
[1:31:17] has been revealed at this time because
[1:31:20] remember look when the Antichrist when
[1:31:22] we go of the Antichrist comes down and
[1:31:24] heat he continues on look over here he
[1:31:27] continues on he's he's revealed through
[1:31:35] he's exposed through us we go up he
[1:31:39] comes down and he becomes he becomes
[1:31:42] Satan incarnate in that Pope while not
[1:31:44] while we're here while we're going right
[1:31:48] the four stages of the Antichrist
[1:31:51] writing has been revealed at this time
[1:31:52] therefore they don't have they don't
[1:31:54] have to have anymore
[1:31:56] there's no more beast left and there was
[1:31:58] four living creatures of God to announce
[1:32:00] the ride rider as they rode for beef our
[1:32:03] four powers all right let's read this
[1:32:05] last one number six this just kind of
[1:32:09] sets the stage for
[1:32:10] for next week now notice and they're not
[1:32:12] verse souls under the altar now here's
[1:32:15] where I'm going to get some real
[1:32:16] disagreement but just watch for a minute
[1:32:18] I thought that too but it didn't come
[1:32:23] that way
[1:32:24] we've I've always thought that those
[1:32:27] souls under the altar where the the
[1:32:28] martyrs of the early church and
[1:32:33] everybody else did to see how wrong that
[1:32:37] would be because you take seal number
[1:32:39] five and you put it right here you don't
[1:32:41] have no martyrs of the early church
[1:32:44] they've already raptured there's nothing
[1:32:47] in this dimension that we're talking
[1:32:48] about that that our born-again
[1:32:50] Christians but you're a Smith taught it
[1:32:56] a little bit different and he always
[1:32:59] thought that these are the souls of the
[1:33:01] altar where the the martyrs of the early
[1:33:02] church and I'm sure that dr. your eyes
[1:33:04] Smith and every one of them says it is
[1:33:06] see but I thought so myself but when the
[1:33:11] Holy Spirit showed the vision to it it
[1:33:14] wasn't it wasn't the souls now now you
[1:33:17] say well I don't know about that well
[1:33:19] now just a minute we'll find out scroll
[1:33:22] it up so everybody can read it please
[1:33:23] these are not the souls of the bride
[1:33:26] Church not at all we thought that was
[1:33:30] the bride Church waiting their souls
[1:33:32] under the altar you see crying how long
[1:33:33] how long Lord let me read it again so
[1:33:36] get it right when he had opened the
[1:33:37] fifth seal I saw under the altar the
[1:33:39] souls of them that were slain for the
[1:33:40] word of God and for the testimony which
[1:33:42] they held
[1:33:44] keep that scrolled up please see the
[1:33:47] Word of God and the testimony which they
[1:33:49] held now don't move from there just a
[1:33:52] minute see and they cried how long Lord
[1:33:54] how long you stay holy and true dust out
[1:33:56] judge and avenge our blood on them that
[1:33:58] dwell on the earth and white robes were
[1:34:00] given to every one of them and it was
[1:34:02] said to them that they should rest yet
[1:34:03] for a little season until their
[1:34:04] fellow-servants also and the brethren
[1:34:07] that should be killed as they were
[1:34:08] should be fulfilled now for they at this
[1:34:11] time if you notice this fifth seal being
[1:34:13] open the church is gone it just can't be
[1:34:17] the souls of the early church now now
[1:34:20] please if you ever did give this
[1:34:22] attention now because this is
[1:34:24] great controversy so I want you to
[1:34:27] listen real close now and you've got
[1:34:29] your papers and things to write with now
[1:34:31] I want you to notice now these cannot be
[1:34:33] themselves because the souls of the
[1:34:35] righteous martyred and the righteous
[1:34:37] people the church the bride has done
[1:34:40] been took up so they wouldn't be under
[1:34:42] the altar they'd be in glory with the
[1:34:44] bride now watch for they are gone in the
[1:34:47] rapture and the fourth chapter
[1:34:48] revelations they were taken up so
[1:34:52] brother Brent was getting ready and so
[1:34:53] am i and the next Sunday we will jump
[1:34:57] into this position that we're talking
[1:34:59] about here this seal this fifth seal is
[1:35:05] not ever don't ever get it in your mind
[1:35:08] that it's the bride no Christian it's
[1:35:12] not somebody not even a foolish virgin
[1:35:15] it's a special group of people that's
[1:35:19] going to be given grace like you have
[1:35:22] never seen it before and if you'll read
[1:35:24] the fifth seal I I'll I've got it marked
[1:35:30] in my seal book but I left it at home I
[1:35:32] circled every time brother Brown said
[1:35:34] grace in the fifth seal unbelievable
[1:35:36] unbelievable why because it's a great
[1:35:39] seal it's the seal of grave
[1:35:41] well now that seal the grace can't do
[1:35:43] you any good over here right what's
[1:35:48] great is gonna do you any good and glory
[1:35:50] you don't need it you need it here you
[1:35:56] need it so you can get caught up you're
[1:35:59] gonna get caught up in grace why
[1:36:00] remember in what is it where's ekor ayah
[1:36:06] we said the headstone will come crying
[1:36:09] what grace grace unto it not just grace
[1:36:13] double grace we need double grace you
[1:36:16] need grace for the inside guy you need
[1:36:18] gracefully outside yeah we need all kind
[1:36:20] of grace but that grace right there
[1:36:23] n-type is gonna be what we need but now
[1:36:28] in action about it's gonna be grace to a
[1:36:30] group of people that never even heard of
[1:36:33] Jesus Christ
[1:36:35] never knew he was the messiah just like
[1:36:38] me and you you didn't care when yous
[1:36:40] young don't tell me now some of you may
[1:36:42] have been born again when you were
[1:36:43] younger I wasn't some of you weren't it
[1:36:48] didn't bother me you know why because
[1:36:50] God wasn't in there but when he come
[1:36:52] knocking on the door it was great
[1:36:56] graves Amazing Grace let's stand

[1:37:04] Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that
[1:37:07] saved a wretch like me I once was lost
[1:37:11] but now I'm found I try to think about
[1:37:18] John Newton as he's carrying those
[1:37:22] slaves across America into America you
[1:37:26] know they say that's where he got the
[1:37:27] inspiration he was just a dirty old man
[1:37:29] I mean he was not a Christian at all
[1:37:33] until he saw the he saw those slaves and
[1:37:36] they were not even singing Amazing Grace
[1:37:38] they were seeing something that had that
[1:37:40] rhythm to it one of their old songs i'll
[1:37:43] get the history they just need to if you
[1:37:46] ever get the DVD it's called Amazing
[1:37:49] Grace and its really good its way how
[1:37:51] John Newton comes from the Lord it
[1:37:53] starts right but can you imagine him
[1:37:54] standing looking down at those slaves
[1:37:57] with angry eyes maybe not allow
[1:38:01] compassion but then one day God came and
[1:38:04] saved that man's soul and he said I once
[1:38:10] was them I once was those people down in
[1:38:15] the bottom of Lex yep I was bound I was
[1:38:18] a slave and I was not going to a good
[1:38:21] place I was going to hell and then God
[1:38:25] took me out of that slave pit and he
[1:38:29] gave me grace
[1:38:32] Amazing Grace Oh zing brain how sweet
[1:38:43] the sound that saved a wretch like me

[1:42:06] that saved a wretch like me you know
[1:42:12] we're getting this fifth seal we're
[1:42:13] gonna sing just over an abundance of
[1:42:17] grace the brother Larry that's what's
[1:42:21] got us here right now it's grace grace
[1:42:26] has brought us to this hour it was grace
[1:42:29] in Paul's day to accept Paul's message
[1:42:31] and to live the life of Jesus Christ
[1:42:35] same way with now we accept the message
[1:42:38] that brother Branham Brahe we live that
[1:42:42] message but somewhere in that message
[1:42:46] has got to bring us a body change like
[1:42:49] no one else that's why I say go to the
[1:42:51] Son of Man the Son of Man G only one who
[1:42:54] took a body change so he's got to show
[1:42:56] up to get us out of here
[1:42:59] you know what nice
[1:43:05] can I say this that's more grace than it
[1:43:08] was on the day of Pentecost can you
[1:43:12] realize that you saw no well yeah that's
[1:43:14] where it started but he got into the
[1:43:16] soul of man these people right here this
[1:43:19] people now not only God gets in the soul
[1:43:21] of man but he works through the spirit
[1:43:24] realm and then we are not a second
[1:43:28] person we're that same man that stood on
[1:43:33] the shores of Galilee in another form
[1:43:36] called the bride now he said that I did
[1:43:39] so he said that so that's what we need
[1:43:41] to do because if we're not the Word made
[1:43:44] flesh sure we can be the Word made flesh
[1:43:45] and still die and go by the grave Jesus
[1:43:49] was he was the Word made flesh but he
[1:43:53] died once for all I heard so somebody's
[1:43:56] gonna realize that we ain't gotta do it
[1:43:58] again to me that's graves brother Lewis
[1:44:01] to me and us grace we could be out doing
[1:44:04] a million other things right now

[1:46:34] [Music]
[1:46:35] there was a healing angel up there in
[1:46:39] Northeast Georgia Medical Center right
[1:46:40] now
[1:46:42] healing not because they're Christian
[1:46:48] there's a healing angel you people we
[1:46:51] gotta believe in this there's a healing
[1:46:53] angel that's in that hospital right now
[1:46:57] that's healing those people and they
[1:47:01] don't even care who is some of them were
[1:47:03] not even Christian duty know probably
[1:47:05] cursed in the name of God yet he's
[1:47:08] healing that's great that's great two
[1:47:11] human beings not just Christians that
[1:47:14] already but more Grace on Christian but
[1:47:17] to heal somebody don't even want to be
[1:47:19] healed
[1:47:20] [Music]
[1:47:37] the Lord we pray Lord with a childlike
[1:47:41] faith of our little sister Lord but
[1:47:43] you'll take away that is in front and it
[1:47:45] won't bother anymore in the name of
[1:47:48] Jesus Christ amen
[1:47:50] believe amen but I don't think about it
[1:47:54] God gives grace to people don't even
[1:47:55] want it so what a great mystery in the
[1:47:58] fifth seal the God gives grace to a
[1:48:01] group of people that didn't want him
[1:48:03] he does it every day it's kind of normal
[1:48:06] to him to send the healing angel up the
[1:48:11] hospital or to somebody's house and they
[1:48:15] don't even know who he is but yet he's
[1:48:18] gonna heal him why because he give him a
[1:48:20] human body and that human bodies got
[1:48:23] problems and he lines that human body
[1:48:25] back up through the help of doctors in
[1:48:27] medicine so how much more us as

[1:50:39] Lord you even when you were here in
[1:50:41] human flesh you've had angels come and
[1:50:44] minister to your father now I pray Lord
[1:50:46] that you've got a human being here Lord
[1:50:49] that needs some help we pray that you'll
[1:50:52] send a special angel send a special word
[1:50:54] to our sister Lord in the time of
[1:50:57] trouble that she will help her in the
[1:50:58] nighttime when it becomes so rough Lord

[1:51:03] and bless her in keeping keep her safe
[1:51:06] Lord keep her mind clear lock Lord so
[1:51:09] that she can hear from you father and
[1:51:12] not the lies of the devil father just
[1:51:15] bless her now and take care of her in
[1:51:16] Jesus name Amen
[1:51:19] why can't we pray for an angel pray for
[1:51:24] an angel Jesus needed angels when he was
[1:51:27] in the Garden of Gethsemane an angel
[1:51:29] came and ministered to him what an angel
[1:51:31] was given to the Lord Jesus brother Ram
[1:51:35] says you have an angel that stays with
[1:51:39] you your whole life
[1:51:42] mine's in bad shape but he'll be all
[1:51:44] right my guardian angels I had to go
[1:51:48] through the light same way with you guys
[1:51:51] but remember one thing's for sure God
[1:51:54] will never lie and Satan will always lie
[1:51:58] even though Satan tells you the truth
[1:52:03] he's a liar and he can do nothing unless
[1:52:10] you allow him to do nothing he has no
[1:52:14] power unless you give him that power
[1:52:20] resist the devil and he'll flee from you
[1:52:25] our problem is as we go
[1:52:31] No resist him and he'll flee from he
[1:52:35] didn't say it walk away he said flee
[1:52:36] from Cleveland the Bible tells us that
[1:52:39] that Satan come to Jesus take him on the
[1:52:43] mountain take him on take him nothing he
[1:52:46] he was pretty comfortable brother a
[1:52:48] because he took Jesus Christ himself
[1:52:50] on the temple so Satan was pretty he was
[1:52:53] pretty confident that he could go to the
[1:52:55] temple and nobody recognized who he was
[1:52:57] do you understand what I'm saying but
[1:53:01] remember Satan had to leave him when God
[1:53:03] the last third time he said it is
[1:53:05] written it is written and if you'll read
[1:53:08] one I believe it's the Book of Luke the
[1:53:10] last one he says it is said because
[1:53:16] being written can be hearsay but when
[1:53:20] it's said by revelation it becomes
[1:53:25] reality all right let's bow our heads
[1:53:28] your heavenly Father thank you for this
[1:53:30] day lord thank you for a time that we
[1:53:32] have with the people of God or there
[1:53:35] wouldn't be no other place I'd rather be
[1:53:36] than here father
[1:53:38] greatest you'd bind us together Lord
[1:53:40] with grace and love and revelation more
[1:53:44] than anything that would draw closer to
[1:53:47] you father forgive us of our sins are
[1:53:48] many mistakes that we make our thoughts
[1:53:52] that are contrary to you Lord and the
[1:53:55] ones Lord there
[1:53:57] our families that are sentencing lord I
[1:53:59] pray that you knock on their door Lord
[1:54:02] knock on the door of their heart Lord
[1:54:06] give them a chance to come in father
[1:54:10] we pray that you'd be with us down we go
[1:54:13] our separate ways it wasn't some of the
[1:54:15] highways we have many miles to travel
[1:54:17] between us all to bring us back together
[1:54:20] winters day night Lord and service for
[1:54:21] you father grant these things in Jesus
[1:54:24] name we pray amen
[1:54:26] you're dismissed
