========================================

so we thank the Lord for giving us Easter every day that's right because it's a resurrection but we're talking on patience now for a long time now we're going to finish up today we're going to read the scripture and then I'm going to read you some quotes that we have not previously read and everybody understands about patience now patience is long-suffering patience is waiting patience is waiting on God actually patience is one of these different things steadfastness constancy endurance in other words in your Christian experience patience should stabilize that up and down day that you have now we all going to have up and down days because we're human that's right but brother random never said he said he said you know just because there's a cloudy Sky doesn't mean there's not a God right it's because that you're being shined on and God's blessing you that doesn't mean you're a God that's right He blesses look at all these people they're billionaires I mean that don't even don't even believe in God they just do it by their own understanding yes so you and I though have got to see that this patience is not just man's patient it's Godly patient right patience to wait on God that he'd do all these promises that he said in the Bible he's going to have to do it because you and I can't right light winds did not he we can't change our body there's nothing we can do to change our body we were born in this pest house we were born in this sin Trout from Mom and Dad that's right yeah framework's going to stay there but we're going to be changed there's something going on in my body now that's taking me to the Grave right things are breaking down now that's not what God wanted God wants us to stay young he wants us that when one cell uh you know I don't understand how when we get over there because I can't understand it a glorified body that cells are not breaking down because that's why we have heat that's why the Heat's in our body why we have 98.6 degrees in our body because cells are breaking down we're actually a little explosion going on right sales are exploding making new ones breaking off making new sales but over there it's not going to be breaking down we're we're just going to stay the same oh yes we're just going to stay the same it's going to be this body glorified all right this body changed in the atom I'm going to be changed in this okay but we better have patience for it because if we won't have patience for it all ran his race he had patience for his time but Paul ran his race to a point and then he said a crown of life has been laid up for me he knows that even job said in my flesh I'll see God when I joke been dead for thousands of years but in his flesh he's going to see God God's going to bring up a resurrection that's going to it'll baffle the scientists that's for sure right because the scientists won't know anything about it it's nothing that uh you know won't be no doctors in heaven or anything like that it'll just be this body made new like we were talking about Wednesday night I hope everybody enjoyed that it was something that I wanted to bring out you know that was that was pressing on people's heart people say new body well it is going to be new because this one is old right but it's going to be the same framework does everybody understand what I'm saying and we're not going to throw this one away and get a new one like we sell a car and get a new car right now it's going to be the old car magnet that's right okay all right we're not gonna throw this one away this framework's gonna be here this is what I'm going to look like through the Millennium at the in that 20 year old body all right and actually what's inside of us because of the born-again experience is already made new that's right that's why we can say sitting in Heavenly places now this is not sitting in Heavenly places that's right this is in dimension one two three that's right right lifelike matter or to mention is demons we skip all through that jump and our soul is actually living in the sixth Dimension everybody understand that that's right because it's Eternal yes but it has come here we don't have to go get it it's come here to get us right it's the vehicle to get us back to that new body this one made new right the Earth's not going to be destroyed and God created the Earth listen God's finished creating then the bible say that Bennett he's finished he's resting now he's finished his Creations or whatever he's created is going to stay that way all right so he's created the Earth to be inhabited that's what it's going to be and we're going to be in flesh bodies inhabiting this Earth we're not going to be angels we're going to be human that's right because that's what we are now we're humans right we're not Angelic beings we're supernatural beings by the new birth but we're not Angelic beings We're Not Angels right right and angels are not going to have wings that's right they don't need them they don't what do you need wings for that's right and a glorified body Jesus didn't need Wings to get out of here on the resurrection did he or you know 50 days after that no he didn't leave that he just stepped over into another dimension which is faster than this one this body can't go through that wall because it's made of Mom and Daddy but when this body's changed in the atoms and it gets faster than these first three dimensions we're just going to go right through the wall right because Jesus proved that when he come through the wall and then he ate flesh he ate fish right he ate fish and it became part of him it didn't go and hit the floor and people laugh about that but that's true I mean if you if you saw somebody walking through the wall you'd think he's like Casper the ghost that he had no form but the people were touching it right but he was solid as I'm solid he was solid he said put your hand in my side well that womb's still there put your hand in my side touch me I'm not a ghost because they thought maybe it was a spoon we would too somebody come walking through the wall and stood right here we'd we'd wonder what kind of body that person had so that's right I was thinking of the people in the graves I mean literally in cemeteries their body's going to have to be glorified to come out of them right so they can because there's you're not going to have any visible notice nope people have risen that's the reason why that's why it's going to be a secret coming this is a secret coming there is not going to be a time when you can go out into the cemetery and see the graves opened up why do they need that don't need it right they're just gonna because you know what they're faster than what's holding them their body's going to become faster because their soul is going to come from another dimension here that's right so what's going to hinder them grabbing this thing glorify it and stand right here Among Us that's right and be trying and there will be chains the ones that are alive and remain we're going to be changed in the morning of an eye while they're standing here they're going to get their change first but it's going to be because of the word that's here on the Earth and it's got to be on this Earth not the Earth the ball it's got to be fulfilled in this earth all right so but we got to have patience we gotta have patience to wait for it we and I think you know the Lord lets us go on sometimes and lets us keep we'll win Lord we'll win 77 Lord or 80 or 86 or 1988 or 2000 and people set days but when they do what happens you get discouraged we don't but most people that are I say the mixed multitude they get discouraged because it doesn't happen when they think it's going to happen if it happened when we thought it was going to happen it wouldn't be a secret that's right that's right that's right I mean it wouldn't be a secret because there's one thing for sure if any man says a day specific day or time he's wrong that's right I don't worry about them I don't I don't worry about them people actually that one guy that made a prediction he's already dead so that's right yeah why are you gonna die but um the grades will I mean the taxes will actually be empty correct right so will these people people that have gone on before until they wake up like in their attached it and I know they don't have to break the ground and come out but you know I think really because that's going to be just a travel park uh what she's saying is is are they going to wake up inside their casket no I think they're going to understand that when they get here that they're going to meet that body okay I don't think they have to go down in there and get it but now remember one thing's for sure let's take this by scripture Jesus had to go back to his tomb to get his body now he didn't have to roll that stone away either that was a symbol for us that was for us that stone did not have to be rolled away for him to walk out of that tune that's right he walked right through the wall so them rocks it didn't matter if it was 800 feet thick and weighed 10 billion pounds he'd walk right through it so that so that was a symbol that now there is an empty tomb and man can look into that tomb and see nothing all right but see this one's not gonna let me this one's not gonna happen that way the world can't go out there and say look at all these empty tombs see that wouldn't be a secret catching away that wouldn't be a secret catching they're going to walk out there and look and even brother Brown said people are going to keep going to church and think they're getting saved you see what I'm saying so so this great powerful thing is going to happen to the bride is going to be so secret the neighbors are not even going to know about it right they're just going to think you disappeared okay what a great God we have a program says they even eat but sharks are a lions or pipe or whatever you're still going to come I read that quote Wednesday redneck quote Wednesday night lives they eat you over here and deposit you over there what does that matter yeah we're gonna bring them all back together when did I just die when they die and they get from the bodies when do they go to right now because they don't get a new body well right now no they're waiting in glory they've got a glorified theophany so it's not a glorified body it's not a flesh with us well they know they're in the sixth Dimension oh that's where all you know that's where brother Branham went to the sixth Dimension and he saw all the people that was his Converse he hugged them knew they were women because of the field you know of the form and he had his hair back remember he said he reached a penny so I got my hair back you know and then he uh then they said my precious brother my precious brother well they told him he had to go back of course obviously but they couldn't come back it's not time for them to come back yet but they are in a glorified condition but not a glorified body now remember you glorified body is this body made new and here we go back to the new part again Jesus is in a glorified body he's the only one that the Bible says has reached immortality now immortality means you were once immortal and now you're immoral right okay that's right that's why it's immortality that's why Angels can't be Mortals and Angels can't have the immortality they never was Immortal but Jesus the Bible says became lower than the Angels right came down lower than the angels to become us that's right that he could take us back above the angels right right that's a sterling that's a sermon and not just fresh too I didn't get that that was fresh but when he come down here and get us because we can't go up we couldn't go up because remember like I said we're planted in corruption corruption can't see that other dimension brother randleman's body didn't even travel across into the sixth dimension remember he looked back and his body his human body was laying on the on the bed that body didn't come with him God just let him being a prophet being being in the Supernatural realm that's right God could allow that man to lay there but be in this other dimension but his human body was not in that dimension because what happened there this is what's going to happen I'm 54 years old if I die today I go into the sixth Dimension my body stays here you plant it in the ground that's what was you plant it in corruption but see when that comes out and I don't have enough Faith to change this thing or have enough word change this thing I go into another dimension and wait on somebody that has enough word and faith and revelation because if it changes him right it'll change me because we'll have a body like into his glorious body so Jesus is already immortal he was already raised from the dead he's already been mortal now he's Immortal and he's in the seventh Dimension remember when brother Brown went in the sixth dimension We're not gonna finish patience again today we must have patience oh yeah sure patience sure patience but my brother Ryan went into the sixth Dimension he said where's the Lord he said he's higher you can't see him now now this sixth Dimension was eternal this is eternal thoughts of God but Jesus wasn't there because he already picked up his human body so he was in a human mortal form that was made Immortal these people left their mortal body and took their soul or their theophany into that next Dimension sixth Dimension and they're waiting because remember brother Brown said they said well we don't eat or drink here we're waiting in other words we're waiting to get back into our right to be conditioned you think man that would be a right to be conditioned because remember he didn't want to go back into his body but that's not the right to be conditioned they weren't human beings in that dimension they were Supernatural Souls right Supernatural Spirits amen not humans now they had remember when I said Wednesday night you keep the framework they kept that framework when they went there hope he saw hope knew who she was right so she had went and changed into somebody that looked different he knew who that was and he had a reality that he knew who she was right right but remember she hugged his neck and said my precious brother she didn't acknowledge Him as husband because in that Dimension she wasn't but now remember don't forget this key brother Brown had another dream he had another dream where remember he said that rewards were being given out he said they called my name he said I felt something right on this side and I felt something on this side and he said I looked and I was hoping he said I looked and that was me then he said oh I knew he said neither knew that hope was jealous jealous woman jealous of you know other people but said there was no jealousy and he said we walked straight into eternity there had something come about when you come back and connect with your flesh that spirit that you had here is going to be made new and you're going to realize that you lived here and I realized that my mother was my mother but there'll be no other part of that she'll be my sister over there but we'll realize what happened down here because we're going to be back into a human body the one we lived in but changed new it was so beautiful when you pointed out the picture that God took is not of a swim leader no 1920 repair Sears and whatever and to prove that to me it's the picture God saw of us over there at the end time see that's what he's looking at that's what I want you to see wayne tonight he's not looking at this he can't look we sin every day that's right we're Sinners saved by grace and the most even when we get the godliness the more the most Godly we can be we're still in a fallen condition that's right so don't ever forget that because when we start elevating ourselves to a place then you're right there with the devil you need to realize one thing it's an inward work yeah I think what proves that is that Vision that he had of uh the baby baby daughter that died saw her as a young woman didn't recognize them but that's what that's the picture God took well I'm going to bring that out Wednesday night but I didn't want to confuse the younger ones a little bit more but yeah that's true the one the member remember Sharon Rose was a six-month-old baby when she died but when he had the dream about the wagon and all that you know he said well where's Billy Billy's over there she was talking excuse me beautiful 18 to 20 year old girl well she was in her theophany she was in her condition she should have been in had there not been a thought see that's what we gotta look at we gotta look at not the things that we see here on the Earth but we got to realize that there is a 20 year old man or woman living in these old bodies and it's wanting to get out and only two things is going to release it and that's death and the change one of the two there's no other way around it we're not going to go under it or over it you're either going to die and wait for somebody to change your body but you know what you got to have first you gotta have a new birth that's right that's right you got to have that Genesis 126 man or woman in you when you die because if you don't that's right you don't get it you go to The Fifth Dimension you go to the center day and you have to be raised up and have to give an account of what you did in his body remember the Bible says you were you were in Revelations 21 I think it says they were they were uh uh they were judged by their works right oh man I don't want to be judged by my words I won't be judged by The Works that Jesus did this morning 2000 years ago that's right that's what I won't be judged by I won't be judged by that now if I'm judged by that now I have the new birth then you know I gotta I always say you got a free ticket well you do have a free ticket but the statue of perfect man still um you got to go through that you gotta show that you're a Christian amen not just say that you're a Christian you got to show it it's got to be an outward appearance of an end would work all right same thing with all these virtues you got to show that you you have Godly patient patience just like God because you know what God's waited for an eternity for us to get back to the right to be conviction he's waited for an eternity for us to get back to a right to be commissioned and he's so patient because he knew the plan Gotta Have It remember it was his plan what an hour it was his plan and to be real honest with you you didn't have nothing no way to get you here but God knew what she was going to look like like I said Wednesday night and what a great God that took this one and met this one back in your great great great great great great grandfather grandmother and here you come all the way down that line that's right because God put those genetics together because he saw you here you've got to see poor knowledge if you don't see poor knowledge like somebody was talking about after service if you don't see foreign knowledge then God did take the tube and say this is the way it's going to be and pull you through it no he looked down through time and saw what you would be and what you would look like that's right because he's the one that had you in the mind first amen and he can't change his mind that's right so not to change his mind he bred this one to this one this one to this one this one this one this to get your nature here oh yes and then he molded with that nature that's right because remember we're molded In His Image not right not him holding an iron we were more than a new image before there was Angels he thought of us so he had us already already there but God has an order he created angels cherubim seraphims angels to do this angels to do that an angel to watch over you and absolutely I believe you did get an angel when you were born because God saw you at a certain age and you know what he can't change his mind that's right right but what we got to do is it's not worry about this have patience that that 20 year old body is not going to come to us that 20 year old body is going to Spring forth from us that's right that's right like the flowers like the things you see now those those flowers didn't come from somewhere and were you know they the flowers sprang up from the plant that they came from that's why the springtime is the resurrection time oh yes because it was all dead we were all dead and sin we were dead and trespassing we were dead to the world we were born dead we were born dead yes yes what what'd the scripture say this um a few days in full of trouble all right life joke said life is a bit of April what if you live 80 years I didn't need my blip on the on the timeline of life right but what about all the people you've outlived that God's took on that that many things have happened to him like Aaron was talking about that Wednesday night after the service week that's why I said we got to understand that that it's not exactly has to be this same flesh that I'm standing in exactly sell myself right because what about the people that like to take Noah because he survived the flood and he died but his body has already deteriorated went back to chemicals those chemicals got in the water an animal drink the water it went into an animal's body it already went into the trees then it went up into the vapor so you know don't let's don't try to wind ourselves into that makes people crazy that's right right it makes craziness to keep thinking back just think just know one thing for sure that God's gonna bring whatever he needs you know all they needed was one cell to get you here oh yes that's all we needed he needed one sperm cell to get you here is all he needed that's right so what does he need he only needs one sale to get you back that's right because he's a Creator he puts a sale on sale you didn't I didn't the doctor didn't I saw a calf we I didn't help them but we were down there in case they needed help pulling a calf out of them out of a cow and that little cap just within seconds was breathing looking around moving and within about 10 minutes it was standing up you know what it did he didn't go over there and start sucking on his mama's leg right it's getting you exactly which he had to go to you understand what I'm saying there's a nature you see God and your boy just makes you sometimes want to cry that that even nature shows God that's right amen and that's life but what about the life you give you though he gave you a life insult he gave you a life yes right and that soul to him is more precious than any life that's on this Earth because if you come from God that's what I want to end on Wednesday but I forgot maybe the Lord didn't want me to say it but I'll say it now if you come if you realize you came from God there's only one place you're going to go you don't go back to God if you realize that you came from God right yeah and you're a genetic makeup of the almighty there's only one thing for you to do let's go back that's right Jesus said that see that's what I mean Jesus said the same thing I go to my God and your God my father and your father yeah but then he said I come from God yeah and I go back to God that's right you know why he was God I see we're not God that way he's the Big G with a little jivo the Big T came to get the Little G's that's right because he wanted us to be him made manifest in another form called his children or his bride that's right um call it what you made children bride I don't care I'm calling Daddy and husband at the same time doesn't matter because we're married to it all of us we're all feminists down here in the body of Christ okay but uh let's not talk about patients anymore I want to read I want to read one quote from these other notes I've been trying to get to for three weeks no wonder Paul could stand in the face of death and say oh death where's your sting Greg where's your bakery sure the tribulations he had learned the love of God suffering brings patience Works tribulation to bring patience of course now patience makes love and trust and when that bull got within about six or eight feet I mean he just threw his feet out and stopped and he looked at me look this way in that way you don't understand that's when the bull that's when the bull uh was charging him and love took over you know what he had to have a lot of patience well let's read this last one everybody kind of okay with this well with patience we we kind of went through it but listen this is going into godliness which will be the next thing we talk about perfect tastes godliness you have to add to your faith hang on I'll make it bigger perfect takes godliness you have to add to your faith godliness see you start off down here with virtue then you go to knowledge and go to Temperance go to patients now you're on godliness godliness oh mine time's getting away mine too but you know what godliness men you sing the song to be like Jesus to be like Jesus on Earth how long to be like him all through life Journey Merc the glory only has to be like him that's godliness when he was Smite on one side of the face he turned the other when he was spoken rough two he didn't speak he didn't roll back see Godly always looking for one thing I always do that which pleases the father say yes sir always that's godliness scene after you've done come from here to here to here to here I think he's pointing up for Pyramid now you're coming into the full stature now of a Son of God that you got to have this plus all this you can't even start until you get this and I believe you just pointing at Faith all right don't forget but you got to have this plus all this you can't even start until you get this now remember the black bird with the peacock feathers don't forget him see don't try to add it till you're actually born again because you it won't work and you can't make it work it'll come to this or this here it'll crumble somewhere but when you get down here a genuine boy and Dove then you don't add nothing it adds to you see comes on up all right coming into Perfection now all right so next Sunday Lord willing we'll start talking about godliness thanks for your patience now listen if the crowd is full upstairs then some of you sisters can come down here we're going to turn the live streaming on some of you sisters that are going to help with the food and all you need to actually stay down here and that way you'll know when the service is over and you can start preparing the food so if you want to do that one hook this and brother Bob we're going to uh in that beautiful baby there my sugar but uh he's going to set that up where you can watch down here okay so Lord bless you foreign
