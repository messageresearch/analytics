========================================

we're going to read second peter chapter one then we're going to look at sister shepard's dream today which is in blasphemy's name all right second peter 1 simon peter servant apostle jesus christ to them that have have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ for grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god in jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain to the life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust all right and besides this so besides you you are you get born again besides this born-again experience this is an addition too everybody understand that this is an addition to this is telling us that the newborn you've got to get this is what you got to get the new birth and look at verse 5. and beside this what besides that new birth add to your new birth yes virtue add to you and your birth knowledge temper patience godless brothers now you get everything you need there's a quote you get everything you need at the new birth that's right jonas has everything he needs to drive a car right except for growth development virtual knowledge temperatures in the natural before he's able to drive a car he's got to gain some knowledge he's got to grow up so that's what we have to do as christians and you'll you'll find there's a lot of people in the message that don't agree with this they think you get everything because brother brown does say you get everything for your journey after your birth well a kid gets everything he needs when he's a baby but that baby's not going to stay a baby he's going to grow up in god all right and that says besides this what besides receiving the new birth add to your new birth or what you believe virtue knowledge knowledge temperance temperatures places goddess godless brother kindness and brother kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound overflowing what we're going to look at today they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lacketh these things is blind quit feeding jonas and he's going to be his growth is going to be stunted his nutrition's going to go down he's going to get sick maybe he's even going to die all right but now he's still a human he's still born into the family of canada everybody understand what i'm saying even though you're born into the family of god you can stop your growth development at any time by not eating and then if you eat on the things of the world like brother brown says you get perverted or you get stunted or or your your growth is not what it should be all right so these are requirements but he that lack of these things is blind and cannot see it far off and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence that you make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall right well now sister shepherd was a sister in brother brown's church and on blasphemous names she was worried whether she had the holy ghost or not when she laid down across the beautiful where her husband was reading a paper she's got little ones that i have and they're always making noise and things and so on she fell asleep for 10 minutes or 15 and she dreamed and she never could understand it or get it all together from a year ago almost until this message was taught now what is blasphemous names it's a higher brother brown goes to a higher degree he preaches this right after he preaches the statue of a perfect man if i understand that you get the book blasphemous names he goes right back into the statue of a perfect man and starts talking about faith's virgin knowledge temperatures and that's what he's saying right here and she never could understand it or get it all together from a year ago almost until this message was taught then while i was teaching it it all came back to her now that was when he drew the pyramid and taught on the statue of a perfect man and she dreamed that she was praying she was walking the floor first before she dreamed and ringing her hands and thinking lord have i got the holy ghost okay so now watch what he's doing can you prove to me some say because i shouted or because i spoke in tongues and believing all that but have i really got it i believe in all those things those virtues speaking in tongues shouting all kind of demonstrations i believe in every bit of it but if if it's there without this in other words the new birth if it's there without this there's something wrong see now see you see you've got a shell see that a shell right see what he's saying watch let's analyze this a minute and she was worried about it so she just laid down across the do a photo where her husband was reading she went to sleep and she dreamed she was on a mountain okay and the best i haven't got on paper before me but i think it like this she dreamed that she saw a rock box like a framework sitting right on top of this mountain and her husband was just behind her and she saw a large man standing there with work clothes on sleeves rolled up bailing the most pure water that she ever seen pouring it into the box all right pouring it into the box okay the rock box sitting on top of the mountain and the rock box would not hold the water all right holes in it our experience wasn't rock solid have some holes in it but look we have the rock box she had the rock box she had the confession she had the new birth brother i was going to tell her that and the rock box would not hold the water and it rolled right out of there see just boiled up all the trash and sticks so as the water of the word goes in okay that rock solid box still has some problems humanity poured the water in it boiled all the trash and sticks and everything in there pulled it out and rolled it down the mountain all right and it rolled out over her feet she was standing right in that stuff only it didn't stick to her what the sticks and the stones and all or all that stuff i didn't stick to her and then she asked why the box didn't hold it the man said that is not water that's the holy ghost nothing will hold it then he went back and got another bucket and it was full of honey and poured the honey in there and said now it will hold this now look go ahead this is the box all right everybody said this is the box he's talking about pouring in and the stuff coming out now brother brown i'm in the statue of a perfect man we'll get to it later this is the honey now you got the new she had a new birth because she had a rock solid box it was her confession she had her confession but there was other things that had to come out all right this is the honey because watch what he says he said you get all these things here he'll say you up here and you don't have the holy spirit well you don't have the fullness of the holy ghost you're not a full adult you've got all the parts you've got all the working mechanism you just can't drive the car yet because what you're doing is you're looking at adoption adoption is not when you're a baby adoption is when you come to something jesus even on the river jordan he said this is my beloved son and whom i'm pleased to dwell stopped right there jesus had to go three and a half years before god took him upon a mountain and said this is my beloved son and whom i'm well pleased hear ye him all right that's the adoption part the adoption part is not when you get born again you have the spirit of adoption remember romans eight you have the spirit of adoption you're in the line of adoption in other words you've got in the right family you've got to get in the right family to be adopted all right so now you come here and this is the honey that you're going to see that he pours out and what you're going to do brother brown said the holy spirit seals these virtues in all right so let's keep going it was full of honey and poured the honey in there and said now it will hold this and she thought the box with the rock box was going to burst out and spill the honey but it didn't it finally stuck together and it held it she turned and went down the mountain going down the mountain she stopped at the bottom of the mountain and looked back she saw five streams of pure crystal water not contaminated by the things that it went through still pure clear coming swiftly then it slowed up then almost faded out and she was wondering would it never reach the bottom of the mountain five strings and she woke up right now he's going to give the interpretation now no more than i picked up the letter and opened it i saw the dream now this is a true prophet see the prophet a true prophet sees the dream himself before i read it he sees the dream and then he interprets it right that's what daniel that's what the problem with um with daniel the people in daniel's day was that remember the people walked up to the king and said oh king tell us your dream he said if you're anything you're supposed to tell me the drink well daniel walks up and said here's the dream and the interpretation so brother brown gives the dream and the interpretation which is the way of a true prophet right now no more than i picked up the letter note before it i saw our dream that's the way dreams are interpreted and many viewers come with me with dreams and say things to me about dreams i say wait a minute you never told it all see and go back and pick it up and if you can't tell what you dream how you know the interpretation is right or not see you've got to see the dream a vision has to show the dream and when you see the dream that the person dream that can tell them before they tell you then you know the interpretation well i believe that's in the scripture also daniel one time all right there's daniel a person would start telling brother about him a dream and he'd just stop him and say wait a minute you missed so and so we're so-and-so so and so then they say that's right all right now here's the interpretation of her dream she was bothered about the holy spirit now as much that she'd been she had seen the box on top of the mountain was the rock rock box and rock confession she had a confession say now like jesus said in the scripture said peter who jesus said who does man say out of the son of man lamb one of them says they are the lies of moses and so forth and he said but who do you say he said thou art to christ now some people say the catholic church he goes on and talks about that that's when each church age has had their rock confession now what did the church age have the holy ghost right holy ghost in every age all right now on up to this rock confession of the laodicea and now you cannot make a holy church there's no such thing as a holy church the holy spirit can be preached in it but in there you find good and bad renegades and different and everything else so an organization will not hold you can't say we got it none of the rest has it the holy spirit is poured out on what individuals it's the individual this is her individual dream now i believe it was all of us but it was too hard she had a question god answered a question so therefore the rock this latter-day pentecostal church which has received the holy spirit they did it the first all down through the ages they received the holy spirit but not in the measure that they have it now right they didn't have these virtues working in their life except in the first stage but that was all eat down eroded man's ideas like what we're talking about last night man's ideas has put a lid on it so it can't work now in the end time we're we're required it was a requirement when peter said it back in a.d whatever that was back in 80 60 it was a requirement but nobody could come to that because of what those five streams to me also represents the fivefold ministry because they bring the washing of the word of the word right you can say grace or jesus wherever you want but it's a five-fold ministry you've got to hear it from somebody before you can get it right all right it's got to be fivefold of it not one all right so my brother brown had to go off the scene so a fivefold ministry could take the voice and break it down to the people they received the holy spirit but not in the measure that they have it now it's the same holy ghost but it's not in the same measure all right because it's a restoration of the first and we take the candlesticks alpha and omega how they lit the first candle went higher got dimmer dimmer then they come back again first and last so forth what's he saying the first church age had it now the last church age is supposed to have it all right now but in this church age the message is being poured into the church but the church body itself and all together like this tabernacle will say that's where she comes to church this tabernacle is not a holy ghost tabernacle there's no such a thing individuals that come into this church is holy ghost tabernacle they are tabernacles that contain the holy ghost but not the church in the body a group therefore it runs out but what this man who was pouring the water the messenger to the church that was him but he's not going to tell you it was him he's gonna say it's the messenger to the church because he's not gonna bring any light on himself right a true prophet always points you to christ so he's pouring the message into the church but what was the water doing it was boiling out all the trash that was in it that's what the holy spirit does now you take it to somebody that that believes that you get everything at the new birth down at the bottom and you get all these virtues and you're adopted reading my quote right there where's the trash at i mean if you got the holy ghost and that's all you need and that's all you got where's the trash the trash is in your spirit and in your body yeah actually it's not your body your body just does what your fear tells you today that's right it's actually the spirit guy that's right okay your soul is redeemed your soul just as eternal as god is but god's got to work on boiling out the trash that was in it that's what the holy ghost does it boils it up now now the honey represented brotherly love brotherly kindness which is this age right i just got through telling sea of brotherly kindness the age that we live in now now you might say look i sure don't like brother neville or i sure don't like brother jones i don't like brother so-and-so and something like that just let something happen to him brother your heart is broken nearly kills you see we can obtain obtain he said we had it see that bob he said we obtained it we didn't have it we obtained it right we can obtain brotherly kindness right and feel for one another because let me let me really you know we're all a bunch of legalists when we first get born again it's always do's and don't do this don't do that and this one's not doing this rightness i'm not doing that right and you're not doing this right you're not well that's what we are we just we're under the log right until christ comes but when christ comes it's not a total chopping off we receive the holy ghost but there's still things like daddy's been saying our memory and our reasoning what is that a lot of stuff in the past memory we can't remember something we haven't done so we can't remember the future right god can show us things in the future but that's through the holy ghost but memory reason we reason about what we know right conscious what does our conscience bother us about what's going to happen tomorrow no it bothers us about what happened yesterday imagination now we can imagine something going to happen but what are you imagining it from what happened in the past i wasn't going this way so this this is good though because what daddy said about the past everything in your spirit realm deals even affection how do i know i love somebody the experience i had in the past with them right right so all that memory reason conscious affection imagination those five senses in the spirit realm all is contacting backwards which is contrary to god right he don't want you to look back that's good that's true got it he won't want you to look back he wants you to look forward by the holy ghost that'll teach you things to come now that promise he promised he'd teach us things to come but see what we got to do is look through the eye of faith not through the eyes that mom and daddy gave us look through the eye of faith and forget the eye what mom and dad gave because i mom and daddy gave us to swear you remember something because you saw it or hear it see you taste phil smelling here you remember something's hot because you felt it you've experienced that well god's trying to tell us here he's saying hey you can obtain brotherly kindness and feelings for one another you obtain it you don't just have it okay but to maintain in a group of people why do you care for that brother because you broke bread with him here at the altar as you will tonight you fellowship with him you shook his hand you worship with him he's your brother and he might do something in the flesh that you would disagree with but you just kind of stay which you ought to do but shun him a little don't do but he said you kind of stay in other words he was trying to try and stay he's kind of stay away from him that's right that's what he was saying i'm not trying to put words in his mouth but read that because you just kind of stay what stay away from him and he said no you shouldn't do that but shut him a little but in the bottom of your heart if something happened to that brother neither kill you or that sister i'm an old man i was once young now i'm old i've seen it down through the age do that hear people say i just won't have no more to do with him and something happens to that man that nearly kills him he thinks oh god i let my precious brother go without making friends with him you see see see it's brotherly love all right my computer security is fine leave me alone get that trash out of there where was i oh you see see it's brotherly love it looks like it won't stick but it does stick the honey it sticks now in as much that she came from there down the hill to the bottom of the hill now this glorious water was gushing over hills and five strings now five is the number of grace j-u-s-u-s-f-a-i-p-s g-r-a-c five is the number of grace and like i said about the five-fold ministry that five-fold ministry is what to you g-r-a-c-e that's the grace of god did you even hear the people it's the grace of god that he leads you to a place where you can hear instead of just listening to one person you got a five-fold ministry that can help you all right five streams is pouring from up here at the trough down through here so there must have been listen there must have been some trash in here because this is where the trash come from the box the trash didn't come from out here the brother brown said the trash come from inside the box and then the trash come out and the water washed it down the side of the mountain all right everybody understand am i okay with that never got it yet could all of these things in a worldly sense be the trash that's going on that's your wisdom yeah absolutely see we have we have a lot of there there's people that you want to be around that has like jen's dad he's got worldly virtue about running business and making money but now that virtue is not virtue i want in the degree that i know that it's spiritual what this does it gives you what this does what the bible and what we're teaching and what the powerful ministry does it shows you how to separate the two see most denominational people think if you're if you're um if you're wealthy you must be of god right well it's not true you can be the wealthiest person in the world what jesus said he said it's kind of hard i was reading the other day a commentary and somebody wrote about could you imagine somebody standing around listening to what jesus said that it would be better to pull a camel through the eye of a needle than it would be for a rich man to go to heaven why because he leans to his money and he does all the time they didn't get their money but if you have these virtues what does it do it separates it separates that that's what that was doing what was it doing it was burning the trash out it wasn't burning the virtue out it's burning the trash out because virtue's not trash if it's holy ghost virtue if it's holy ghost knowledge it'll stick but there's a lot of trash in there that's got to come out because that's what that dream says all right look each one of these ages had that rock confession what the holy ghost so she had the rock what brother brown was trying to explain to her is that the holy ghost has got to be poured into the church so it can continue to wash us out each one of these agents had that rock confession the saints were sleeping waiting waiting waiting seeing home till this age but soon the holy ghost being poured out from christ will come and seal up the church all right now that's not down here that's right here he's referring right back to his to his chart where he wrote the holy spirit right here because if you read in the statue of perfect man the holy spirit here is what sealed these virtues in all right each one of these ages had that rock confession the saints sleeping waiting waiting but soon the holy ghost being poured out from christ will come and seal up the church then the church will be raptured it will be a complete unit of god a bride for christ who will be the head of all things you follow me now congregation says amen which i'd doubt now she was wondering now in her dream she was wondering would this little stream with this little stream ever get to the bottom see it was drying up now being that she she herself now here's what i want you to get to now she herself was wondering about her own self did she have the holy ghost now shawn's saying this a few days ago thinking that the church would be spiritual enough to catch it and maybe i put i better turn this tape off right now because i don't want it to get amongst brethren but you could speak with tongues shout dance cast out devils do anything you want and still not have the holy ghost didn't even disciples come back rejoicing because the devils were subject unto them and jesus right among them was judas jesus saying that day you'll cast out devils and i'll say depart from you by your fruits you'll be known now you say brother brown do we should we speak with tongues absolutely that's a gift but those gifts of god without these virtues makes a stumbling block to the unbeliever you see there these gifts of god without these virtues in them in other words the life it's going to go back to the looking at the life that's right remember the brother that he went to and the one brother speak in tongues and he would interpret and man he thought he was with angels and then the lord revealed to him that this guy was living with a woman and had babies by another person just living in total adultery and then god showed him you know the rain falls on it just in the unjust so that's what it is and then brother of animals say power without character is what satanic okay well power because this age joel said i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh he didn't say just the bride he said i promise beard upon all flesh that's why brother brown had to preach in northern ones at ten times so that's what's coming in the end time it could be so close amen amen he's saying amen but these virtues here without this that's what says treaty was saying this virtue without character is satanic a man can use this virtue to make people prostitute their body you see people with charisma and sweat well they got virtue yeah there's some strength that's drawn because listen promise you one thing if there's one of these for god there's one of them for the devil right so power the holy spirit anointing without character is satanic okay you'd be anointed with the holy ghost every day your life remember on your spirit dying on hell and look like these virtues are working in a man's life but look they were all empty look it makes a stumbling block to the unbeliever it's not accepted by god all right this has to be first and when you have faith virtue knowledge temper spaces godless and brotherly love then the holy ghost comes down and seals you as a unit now a lot of people in the message believe that that you have to get all the virtues before you get the holy ghost but he just said read him where he says power without character it's satanic all right the holy ghost comes down and seals you as a unit not as a baby but as a unit the way he makes his bride is the way he makes his individual made out of same material like eve was made out of adam ripped from the side here is the things that you have to have first you can't impersonate them you can't imitate them they've got to be god's sin and god born imitation only causes confusion right seals you as a unity is that adoption yes there was a sentence that he did since the church seals the church age yeah back up back up 136 yeah 136 right there it says those who knows it says u.s unit the same as he says the church okay what's the question well see all the churches were not adopted the only only the only people that adopted is people in the end time okay because the church ages most of them five up six of them actually didn't have all these virtues the the virtues were going out it you know when three when 325 a.d and 606 when they started bringing in uh father son holy ghost uh eternal hell and all the things that we kind of talked about last night it kind of took the birches down and then it was just you just got born again was about it now you just barely squeezed into the body all right and then but now see you come back up what he was saying about alpha and omega whatever was in the beginning has got to come to the end before it can be restored all right so look that's the way he makes his bride is the way he makes his individual made out of same material like he was made out of adam or rib from the side here's the thing that you have to have first you can't impersonate them you can't imitate them you've got to be godsend and god born imitation only causes confusion he talks about the buzzard but it has to come from the inside and it produces christianity god by the power of the holy spirit our sister had her feet wet when she got to the bottom all of us know sister shepard to be charitable her house is open brothers i don't care if it's a bum beggar oh god accepted that her foundation part you hear that feet her foundation part what birth she had the new birth faith right down at the bottom of the pyramid she had that but then all these other things happened all right it says here is what's wrong with the i turn on for this here's what's wrong with the branham tabernacle there's two different kinds of faith there's two different kinds of virtue right two different kinds of knowledge different kinds of temperaments one thinks it's prohibition thank god it ain't that kind of temperance that god is talking about it's that ungodly uncontrollable temper you got and things of that side fast back fuss patience and so forth there's a mockery of it and pretend to be a nature given faith and nature given virtues that's what i mean there's a nature given part of that but you guys see that that's burnt out dead not divorced dead and the biggest part of our faith is mental faith by hearing the word it brings us to a mental recognition of god that's why that like brothers dave was talking about last night the bible says in ezekiel i give you a new spirit well that's not the holy spirit that's just a spirit that makes you religious by bringing it by hearing the word it brings you to a mental recognition of god all right if you stay there that's not good but if you keep going on but if this coming from above oh brother if it ever strikes this there's a godly spiritual faith then what does that faith do that faith recognizes only the word no matter what anything else said don't recognize the word but then the beginning word word has been god where it was god the word is still god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us when the word itself is pouring into our faith you hear that so you don't get it all you got to hear the word the word has it all right you've just got to get in there and let it what discern the thoughts and intents of your heart and the word was made flesh and draw the most when the word itself is poured into our faith our mental faith becomes a spiritual revelation right so let's go upstairs we'll finish this two sundays from now i'll be in new jersey y'all remembering your prayers leaving friday be back sunday afternoon kind of late so keep doing great i won't chew you you know what oh no all right
