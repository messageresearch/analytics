said Lord I still want to see you he said go stand in the Rock and I'll pass by and let you see the back part cuz that was all that could be seen at that time but see we're not in that day we're in the day when we can see the almighty God revealed right good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if You' like turn in your scriptures turn where we've been reading in Psalms 118 and then and we

father author and finisher of our faith Our Redeemer our all in all and Jesus is your name thank you for that name and thank you for revealing that name unto us Lord that we may see you not as a name

manifest as we read your word it doesn't have to be anointed but the ears that hear it must be anointed to understand what is being said guide us now in Jesus name amen amen Psalms 1118 in verse 19 open to me the gates of righteousness I will go into them and I will praise the Lord this gate of the Lord into which the righteous shall enter I will praise thee for thou Hast heard me and art become my salvation the stone which the builders refuses become The Headstone of the corner this is the Lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes this is the day which the Lord hath made we will be we will rejoice and be glad in it say now I beseech thee Oh Lord oh Lord I beseech thee send now Prosperity Blessed Be he that cometh in the name of the Lord we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord now we'll go to Zechariah or we read this morning verse one Zechariah 4:1 and the angel that talked with me came again and wed me as a man that is wakened out of his sleep and he said unto me what seest thou and I said I have looked and behold a Candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps there own and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof the two olive trees and two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof so I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my Lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and I said no my Lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zeruel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayth the Lord of hosts who art thou oh great Mountain before zerubba Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone d RO with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands of zeru will have laid the foundations of this house his hand shall also finish it and thou shalt know the Lord of hosts has sent me unto you for who ha despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubabel with the seven with those seven they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the whole earth you may be seated to the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now I try to read the scriptures related to what I'm speaking about you know and the things and uh you know so I hope you followed me through there with the psalmist as he was speaking of you know the these things and showing them and thank you baby and it come down to speak of the stone and it became down to speak of the Cornerstone you know the things and and it's showing see the Bible is written to reveal God to the people would you follow that line the Bible is God's word that he has given unto us to reveal himself unto us right by the opening of his Worden all right now he not only then just gave us the Written Letter he also gave us someone to interpret that because we chose that we we asked for it you know and that we chose to let God speak not man but there in Moses and then when God gave Moses the Ten Commandments see that was the word of God all right he wrote five books off of that and uh you know but the tables of stone was what we're talking about this morning was in the Ark of the Covenant and that was all which were the Ten Commandments and when they came into the temple that was completed or finished there in the scriptures of the the time in the wilderness and also the time in the it doesn't mention them in the the original ones you know it brings it on over to Ezra and Nehemiah and the Zachariah when it speaks of the tables of stone you know going into the temple but you know God is trying as I said to trying to reveal himself to mankind by his written word the prophet said first it was written in heaven you know and and the and then it was written in the pyramid and then written on letter by man but God is Not only trying to reveal himself to man that's the original plan and part of it you know but he wanted to reveal man you know himself he wanted to show us what we are or what he has made us he's made us a great thing and he's wanting us to see what he has made us you know it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people the Sheep of his Pastor the the psalmist was say but that's what I'm trying to get me and you to see that you know the Lord is trying to not only reveal himself but he's trying to reveal you and I I believe it's page 74 Christ of mystery where that the prophet said the bride is part of the mystery and being part of the mystery you know what she must be revealed right so then i' I'm I'm saying this now for this the the part that I want to get to after a while I told you if you want to see yourself see we were we were taught never to read the book of Revelations because it was in symbolics and we couldn't understand it you know and all like that you know well there's a lot of the symbolics that was in The Book of Revelation that God himself explained right and uh you know so it's no problem but then when the Prophet came we don't have any trouble but to me if you was to take away the entire you you know you going to take the Bible away from me and you said we're going to give you one book out of the Bible and you know you must take that and and live off of it and all you know what I would take I would take the Book of Revelations amen I would take the Book of Revelations go over any book that is in the Bible am because you remember I've tried to get you to see that the book of Revelations is the only book that's dealing personally directly to revealing you amen right it's revealing God in you you show me after service I'll be glad to sit in my office with you and you take the Book of Revelations and you show me Jesus Christ anywhere revealed in the Book of Revelation apart from mankind now you know what I mean by that you get in in Revelations 5 and you'll see one sitting on the throne but then there's a bride around the throne right M all right now you understand what I'm saying all right you'll see this that or the other but you'll always see the bride so to me the the Book of Revelations is the bride's book and that's what we want to title this this afternoon I didn't really know what the title was but I I believe that the coming of the Lord is the revealing of his word taught you that over and over I believe it I believe it started on the day of Pentecost in the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know started his second coming all right now then in doing that see then the title of the message is his coming or coming revealed in the Bible I don't believe God does anything that he doesn't show it in his word right he shows it in his word amen okay because that would be the complete revelation of Jesus Christ you know God on all right so he's coming his coming is being should be revealed to us in the Bible amen all right and you say but now uh we don't understand about we' got the prophet to express what the Bible is saying yet your Prophet himself said you don't have to change it he said you just take it what it says it's self-explanatory to where you know that we should understand now that's just like I said this morning read in Zachariah that Zachariah is shown seven golden candlesticks but he didn't understand H now he's a prophet so he knows God is not just dealing with him now um Joseph ran me off some things about that manora of the nine and the Seven right and uh it's all in my office You' be glad to have it I mean you can have it if you want it don't your computer it doesn't matter it'll come up there is a a nine candlesticks monora and it has a reason for being that in in the doing but then there is a seven golden candlesticks see and we read here in Zechariah that you know of the seven candlesticks and then or lamps you know and then U it took me back and I should have brought the scriptures but I just kind of assume everybody understands so you know I'm sorry that if maybe uh you don't just fully understand when I say candlesticks and I but Moses remember built the uh back in uh Exodus 3 25 31 through about 37 Moses built the seven golden candlesticks and put it into the church so you know it it would come down from there cuz he built it now you have to be careful reading because it sound like he's only building six but then you read down to verse 37 and it says seven you know but uh you know my point is this or what I'm bringing that up for why would Zachariah be the fact that he wouldn't understand if he could see seven golden candlesticks would not that seven golden candlesticks be the same thing that he showed Moses and showed him how to build it maybe Zachariah had seen the seven golden candlesticks there were many times they were destroyed and taken back and made many of them and put them in many places and ET Etc backwards and forth and uh looked like he would have said well I see seven going to candles stick just like Moses built but he didn't he just plainly said I don't understand see and God was going to show him if you missed this morning's message please go back and listen God was showing Zachariah the seven golden candlesticks and what it would be and how that it would be the God revealing himself down through seven Church ages coming down to the end time and showing us the end time of where we live and how that we are here see and showing verse six then is what is this I don't know then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto jerus saying not by power and by might or by my but by my spirit sayth the Lord H it was showing God to be revealing himself in the church ages and that's where we'll go in a little bit when we get to Point I've got something else I wanted you to see but we'll get over to that in a minute and we'll go to Revelations and and pick up this seven golden candlesticks to show it over there now what I want you to see is I'm I keep driving the point the prophet said God would be visible Among Us and raise the dead and we go into Rapture but he said he would not be here in a physical body we would meet that body in the air in the Rapture all right but now see visible Among Us is not visible like you know I'm holding up a bottle of olive oil you know and say well that's the way it's got to be now you know got to be like that be visible no if God is revealing himself to you now which had you rather have the understanding of the seven golden candlesticks verse 1 and two as to what Moses made you know or had youd rather have it as we read in verse 6 and 7 and going down that this would be the word of the Lord this would be God revealing himself which would you rather have after have God revealing himself but now he can't reveal himself contrary to the letter you hear a lot about in the people they take it and do it you know where brother Brown says you read between the lines well just remember that if you're reading between the lines it can't be contrary to what's on the line right but that's what the people of the message is take it they read between the lines and they get any kind of Doctrine they want right bless see I'm reading between the lines not read the line that's right and if the line verifies what you're saying we can talk about being between the lines right but if it don't verify that forget it you know all right now but be invisible Among Us I said it three times this morning and I believe it we've all spoke of and all around the message of the hour for 4 years now we've been talking about the coming of The Headstone all right I believe the coming of The Headstone is the revealing of the word of God I believe it I believe the headstone is the what the prophet said it was back Dar as it went into the temple when they got it completed that it was the Ten Commandments or the seals he said I believe that was the part that was not made known back there even in Jesus's Ministry he preached six seals but he didn't tell nobody that's what he was a preaching he spoke of it all right but then the prophet in the end time came and God revealed the seals I believe the seals are The Headstone to the church because headstone and Cornerstone is the same Stone except for the difference of the position that's doing it was the Cornerstone in the apostles the prophet said but said in the full church it's The Headstone now I believe that headstone to the Bride of Jesus Christ as around the world now not just one individual having it I believe brother random had that headstone don't you I believe that now I believe he was adopted manifested son of God and but now when the Bride of Jesus Christ around the world comes to the position of adoption it's only going and The Headstone unites with the body of Christ then it's not going to be long because it wasn't long when Jesus was shown on the Mount of transfiguration about somewhere close to 6 months from there to Calvary so then don't look for it to be a long time uh the reason that we haven't uh reason we're here 40 years 40 something years later after the prophet has gone is because you and I didn't understand the revealed word oh we had the letter yeah I I purchased a computer in the first ones it was one of the first ones brother Neil hav with his group now brother M had one earlier but I purchased one with brother Neil havin that's been what 30 years almost 30 years ago uh see well you know what that computer had everything brother around said as far as they had entered but you know that dumb thing couldn't tell me a when we got it set up you've heard me tell about it I you know I bought it $3,500 for the computer and the message you know set it up at the house got it all ready brother hav walked to stru doing an an me put it together and we got through and I said boy now we can do something called we get a word search of course it was Dosh but it was all right so I typed in serpent you know what it came up zero I said now here I done pay $ 3500 for this booger and you know how many times brother R used the word Serpent and here I am I can't find one of them and I said look at the spelling I spelled it word wrong was the computer's fault so when I spelled it right the computer there it was all of them quotes hey I was feeling good but understanding what I'm saying the computer had the message but it didn't have the Revelation right intellectually I I have done as much as read six books a day and listened to two tapes and I used to be called an educated Theologian but they kind of left the education off now in the Theologian too and just call me an intellect but that's all right I still love to read and study the prophet's message and if if that's wrong then you know I guess I'm wrong I just I just love to do it but you know because I believe in brother R was a prophet I believe he has the answer to all things I I don't believe me and you has too many He he'll tell you how to raise kids he'll tell you how to fish he'll tell you how to hunt oh you just you get in there hunting you know he said get down wind or stay over here stay over there don't do this you learn how to hunt listen to The Prophet you know cuz he got it all the way around but let me get off of that you know but see I believe that headstone came to the prophet which was those seals right now that didn't mean it was for me and you at that time right come wasn't there that's right brother Hal was there and brother Gary uh was there when the seals was preached but I believe he tell you he didn't understand a whole lot about what that Prophet had to say about it you know all right but you see irregardless the revealed word is The Headstone now here's the statement I made this morning morning I believe that the headstone uniting with the body of Jesus Christ not one individual the entire body of Christ around the world that that will be the closest thing that you'll ever see to the actual presence of almighty God dwelling upon Earth in the end time amen because that is the revealed word right would you not agree that that would be the headstone the Cornerstone was the faith of the fathers and The Headstone is that you know the the word all now here's what I want you to see the prophet said 363 Church age book number one on your notes that with the restoration of Power with the restoration of word comes restoration of power well we've been here 40 something years and we've read the message we read the message we read the message where's the power well I got another one over here a couple of quotes over but hold on before you read that one so let's just get to going the prophet goes on to show you that Romans or the Bible does I like to take the Bible and the prophet put it together and see what it talking about right Romans 1:16 And1 17 Paul said he wasn't ashamed of the Gospel of God because it was P the power of God un salvation right all right you want Power get in the word there's power in the word of a king is that right the meats and purins they couldn't even change it that's why Esther the the king could not take back what he had said about killing them so he wrote a decree they could defend themselves cuz he couldn't change his own word the word of a king cannot be changed or altered all right now but the prophet I gave it to you 117 samon Church age book that power without character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule so if we're wanting the power of God why not deal with the word of God Amen yes but brother Dale I've heard you preach and you preach and yep and every time I preach I get a little higher or God revealed something to me now what is it to you uh it's never failed yet just like I said this morning the Lord showed me something about the two olive trees I'll get back to it later and I've been studying on it for over 40 years to try to get an understanding because it just didn't click in my head I'm sorry it just don't don't click to me it don't click I'm just a dummy but I you know I I like for it to be revealed all right look what your Prophet said if you talk about see people will say but but brother Dale the power of God left when the prophet left well you know like that man quoted all God was he poured into Christ all Christ poured into brother randam he died and took it with him we don't have nothing no I don't agree with that if he's a same yesterday today and forever he ever was a Healer he's still a Healer ever was a savior he's still a savior he ever had power he still has power you're limited him by putting it to the basis of saying that only the prophet had the power of God look what he says on number three of your notes adoption 1962 522 and he's reading the scriptures about the eyes of our understanding being enlightened we may know the hope of the calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saint what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word we they say the power's gone the the the power hasn't even arrived yet amen no I'm sorry you know I mean like Paul said if I become your enemy because I tell you the truth I say have I become your enemy because I found what the prophet said you know I mean that I can't help it and then the one that we gave was quoting this morning the prophets and questions and answers in 54 where he says that after the door of the Gentile church is closed God will anoint a church and you'll see in one year what theologist tried to do in 2000 uh he said wait until the anointing of the church really strikes home to that Faithful Little Remnant all right so if you're looking for the great powers and the things now we're certainly not looking for it to happen as the prophet said people are looking for great things to happen that will be to the W to Witnesses right they'll close Heaven Etc but now we're supposed to have the power of God to take us into Rapture right so don't weaken it you know all right so let's just read a few right here on what we're talking about because I believe in the power of God I believe our problem is this is we doubt him we do not follow his word and you know stay with what he's saying so listen to what he says here on speak to the Mount 1959 11:23 but while we're up on that other he's on the church he said he's doing it now cuz that's what he's been doing he's been anointing the church all the way through the seven Church edges you tell me where he was in anointing see that's all we just got to get this way I it's great Revelation brother de yeah keep reading between the lines you will read right on over in the tribulation so I can't help that I'm sorry watch what what the prophet said I believe that the Church of the Living God is moving into it 1959 11:23 speak to this Mountain Church of the Living God is moving into a sphere now that's going to shake the whole world that's the first time it's been since the days of Jesus of Nazareth to a human being ask anything that you will and it shall be given unto you is that Mark 11 right anything you desire don't you see the words of Jesus Christ being fulfilled oh it's going to come to pass pretty soon I'm looking for it to happen in this meeting I'm waiting for it to happen now think of all the great signs and wonders he had seen and yet he's looking for something now that the anointing will strike the whole Church of the Living God and she'll rise to her feet like a mighty Army the sick will be healed by a word the blind will see the deaf will hear the dead will be raised up and the power of God will shake the world with the Church of the Living God we're in the process of it now I believe it's soon coming to pass I believe it will be just exactly that way I believe it's going to strike the Church of God soon and it's going to start a Revival that'll shake the world I believe it he goes on down telling his heart is under anticipation waiting for those things you say well that was only for him but that's you know that's all right that's your way of think thinking but now listen see when you read things automatically people will uh go to one extreme or the other you know see I can read that and boy everybody geared expecting great things well then here's the other side they don't understand all that was over with the prophet is finished want see that you're not going to satisfy everybody so forget it see I'm not trying to satisfy nobody I'm just trying to preach the gospel I'm not putting off something until this comes I've said it all along I believe God is here healing a sick and doing great things if we would just believe it and confess it yes he can take care of it I believe he's always been heing that because I believe Hebrews 13:8 right now here's what I want I want to show you I believe what the problem is see because we've heard the word by way of the Prophet we think we have the revelation of the word of God you know we think we have the revelation of the word of God you know I know I'm sarcastic arrogant hateful old Couer but you know what I like to do I like to get something that you don't know anything about and just stand up here and say well now who knows anything about it get on up and come on up here you said well why would you want to do that because I want you to think that you don't know everything and you better believe you get up here and ask me a question and I don't know the answer I ain't going to be dumb enough to get up and walk up there I'm going to sit back there too but you see I believe God has given us away but to just know the letter of the message it said my computers got it what if you had a photographic memory you could meor memorize the whole message that's right that wouldn't mean a thing that's right Paul said the let kill us but the spirit give us life but see we don't depend upon God to to bring it the way that he says he'll bring it now this is the point I want you to see you said well you're talking about yourself okay I'm talking about myself so forget it I just grin with you see cuz I don't care it ain't going to give me one more dime in my money and it ain't going to help me no more than anything else I'm just honest I just I preach if ain't nobody here my wife stays with me I'll preach to her you know now listen we've got to depend upon God to reveal his word do you agree now that God that we're depending upon to reveal his word has set certain guidelines that we must follow now you don't have to amen for a while cuz a lot of you ain't going to amen the any anyway you know but just listen try to stay away and do that part of it but I wasn't the one that chose this we as a people when Moses came out to the burning bush he was ready for everybody as I've always tried to teach you the whole Mountain was on fire and there was just a bush for everybody and they could have talked to God but do a scared you know why they done sin 10 times before getting very far and problems had taken place and so they said Moses you go up and get it and bring it back and we'll do it they never would do what he said right but they told him to go get it and bring it back and they do what he said now we chose for a man to speak to us I wasn't back there and you down here we chose for God to speak to us and he sent us away he gave us a prophet right now we can kind of stay right there can't we unless he differs with something we don't like oh my but what about a five-fold ministry that's right you know where it says he gave some Apostles and some proph you know those are gifts that are given to the church there in Ephesians and that's a five-fold Ministry I gave you a couple of quotes just for something for you to think on about I'm trying to get you to see that we've got to have the revealed word are the word revealed unto us brother brownon says on who is who is this mzd 1956 he says the Revelation is Sovereign number six on your note the Revelation is sovereign God's Sovereign in his choosing even the Revelation is Sovereign the re the very Revelation itself is Sovereign in God Amen that's how people Ponder at it and jump at things and hit all things not knowing what they're doing God Sovereign he reveals to who he want wants to that's right well I read every book lord it's your fault I read every book blist never tape and here one man over here just heard one tape and and you done reveal something to him now that's Cain and Abel again so you must be able to figure out somewhere which side you're on right about now on that basis yourself but then he gets down to the message of Grace 1961 827 and he's talking about God has five offices Apostles prophet F his pastors and teach he says they're sovereignly given you can't pray for them now he didn't mean you don't pray for me you don't pray for gifts gifts and callings are without God I mean without repentance right you don't you don't pray for gifts you pray to stir at the gift that is within you right amen you use the gift correctly but now once then in doing that that's what God put out there you got to depend on it and you're Prophet I agree with him he said it's hard for one human to believe another human you I come out here and say God spoke to me I look at the faces and some are grinning and some are frowning and some are asleep some you don't know which one's what I was laughing today thinking about the absenteeism here you know absenteeism is about like the Braves ball team I don't know much about it but I do know they do that but you know they get in the winning streak and they'll they'll win about six or eight games in a row well that's way some of you are you do pretty good for a while but then all at once they get in a slump and they lose about six or eight or all right that's the way people do feel me what kind of bat average do we have but that's up to you you claim the raptures coming and then you want to stay at home well I get it off the internet what if internet clicks well brother Dale you repeat yourself so much till we'll hear at next service that might be true but it might not listen but do you believe in a five-fold Ministry and do you trust it you say well I'm here today that's true but you can be sitting here and not be dependent upon the fivefold ministry right you can be sitting here listening to see if the fivefold ministry is going to agree with you or preach it the way you want it preached okay but now even in the fivefold ministry itself how many of ministers believe in the five-fold ministry how many ministers is it kind of like a man told me one time I said something about tithe paying and he said does a pastor pay tithe I said he's the first one he said well who do he pay it to I said well you can't pay it to yourself so that's a good point but you need to find somewhere you can pay it to you know then I've tried my best to explain a simple matter of what I do is I just you know the money is there and then we just give it to these brothers that come around and preach you know the ti pay and is taking care of it but you see this thing has gotten down until people are dealing with really a oneman Ministry and they're not brother random they're themselves and they're the only one that's got it but that's all right and see then when I come along and then I bring up something it's like we was in a ministers meeting one time and I got up and it was in a subject was on and I asked a question and I thought this man he's he's pretty smart fellow I would call his name but a lot of people wouldn't know it but I had the services over with he said you know what I hate he said I hate a guy that asks a question that he's the only one in the building that's got the answer for it I looked at him I said I wouldn't ask that question if I had wasn't the only one that didn't have it I mean that did have it cuz I figured nobody else didn't I know they got mad at me one time because I said you guys ain't added this is in a big ministers meeting I said you guys ain't added one word to what the Lord revealed to me in 82 when I preached him seals they didn't like it I don't worry and I didn't mean I'd preached everything I explained it some of you were sitting there I explained what I was saying amen what I was saying will God reveal one one God he revealed a seals he revealed a marriage and divorce he revealed marage and divorce you know to us he revealed all those things and everything was in order but now listen let's get on with what I'm trying to get to you we've got to believe in a five-fold Ministry to bring us for they're they are for the perfecting of the Saints and remember Romans 1:15 161 17 that the gospel is the power of God under salvation so the gospel would have to depend upon having a fivefold ministry right okay brother around and said I'm taking these things break them down big nuggets these ministers break it down into small smaller ones see but now follow me let's see if you agree for a little while now as we read in Zechariah of the seven golden candlesticks and what he done he was showing to Zachariah the seven Church ages now brother Rand said there seven Church AG in the Old Testament and seven in the new I cannot place the seven in the old because he never placed them he placed a few of them like marry him uh going through uh dancing in the spirit and things he said that was the Pentecostals well if I can never find them I'll be glad to give them to you but I can't but I believe him I believe there were seven Church ages in the Old Testament I believe there seven in the new the Old Testament would end with the seventh Church age probably because it would end up with John the Baptist to introduce the Messiah and the church ages would end with the Elijah Ministry in the last days to introduce the Messiah so we've got some things we can go by but now have you really thought about it is saying this morning that those Church ages I believe the church ages is God revealing himself right as I said about the Book of Revelations it is a bride's book he is revealing himself in the church right all right now if we can prove that part we should we should be somewhere closer to understanding you know the the things now I'll give you this uh if you look at number eight on your notes patas Vision uh which is church a book page 50 brother randam is explaining uh the two olive trees down to bottom the two trees represent the Old and New Testament and of course the old tifies the Holy Spirit who alone can give the light of God to the people the angel who spoke to Zachariah was as much is saying this what you see means that the church cannot accomplish anything by its own might or power but by the Holy Ghost all right so then what is he saying what is he saying to us not by power not by might look at the number nine and you'll have to find it it's a whole page with the line of it okay and then we got a piece on the back we'll get to it's the message of Grace 1961 827 the prophet is using that scripture of Zechariah and he says there in the part of it he's talking about Zachariah and he said did you see the message will not come by some great mights or Powers but by the spirit of God we're all acquainted with this scripture paragraph 48 that reads the Bible we know that this was during the time of the preparation of the restoration of the temple and zerubabel was a great Prince among the people who had laid the foundation of the building now this is some of this morning you know but come on we holding it together and you I want you to put on your spiritual thinking anointing jacket this morning as we think and this great Prince that had determined to rebuild the house of the Lord and then when he did he had laid the foundation stone and we read on further we find out that God said aable has laid the foundation with his hands he also shall bring forth The Headstone I want you to notice he never said he shall bring forth the Cornerstone he shall bring forth The Headstone we all know that the scripture says that Jesus is the Chief Cornerstone and he's also the headstone now if you will think for a few minutes that the seven Church messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit not by power not by might but by my spirit sayith the Lord not by organizations not by denominations but by the Holy Spirit H Holy Spirit God will bring forth the church in the last days all right now do you see what he saying jerub being in the book of Zechariah is representing the end time messenger that would be on the scene in the end time to bring the word all right and so that's what Zachariah is being shown is the church ages now keep it in mind he's being shown the church ages you say well I agree with that but I want you to hold that point for a few seconds paragraph 51 jeru Prince with Prince with Joshua was a one that that was to bring forth The Headstone he had L laid the foundation he took the people back to the foundation and tip which we all know that these candle sticks and so forth represented both Jewish and church they were Olive branches the Bible said here and the Olive Branch we are we are the wild wild branch that was grafted into the root of the T Olive Tree Gentiles and out of these two branches come sensor pipes going into the seven golden candle sticks to give the light to the seven Church ages now I'm trying to prove to you and I that the coming of the Lord is already taking place not something to look for it's been taking place since Pentecost amen because it's been the revealing of his word now all right you agree let's go over now to Revelations 1 okay you read the whole thing we'll just jump over try to get to a place look at verse 12 of Revelations 1 and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks now the same thing EX Zar we see it right seven golden cap St okay now but remember now Zachariah didn't understand the fullness what would take place in the ages Etc the time he was an Old Testament Prophet looking forward John is taken to patmas not John the Baptist John the Revelator with the baptism of the Holy Ghost is taken to patmas and going to be shown the future Church Ages which is chapter 23 and going through all right but before he does look what he shown to him and I turn to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden Candlestick John do you understand yeah understand and I read Zechariah and I read Moses understand seven go count I know all about seven that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven and then you got the bowl and then you got this and then you got that and you got this thing go here and this I understand it I got the reev now look what he got into trouble with it verse 13 he saw something very unusual right right and the midst of seven golden candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about the pouch with a golden girdle his head and his hes were white like wool white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire feet like undefined brace as they burn in a furnace and the voice as a sound of many water and he had in his right hand Seven Stars out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun that shineth in his strength and when I saw him I fell at his feet watch you and he laid his right hand upon me saying fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am aive forever more amen and have the keys of hell and death if that is a Scofield Bible you're reading that's in red letter signifying that's what the Lord Jesus is speaking shouldn't have any trouble thinking that's what it was anyway but now John being a prophet also God shows him something but does he understand he literally falls down to the feet to worship number 11 on your notes patas Vision brother Rand said that is not a prophet that was God must read letter personally speaking all right what did John see well they saw seven golden candlesticks later on he's given the word to go to each Church age of those seven right but before he goes he's given a vision translation whatever you want to call it and he sees one standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks like unto the son of man he didn't say it was the son of man it was like unto the son of man John what did you see well I really don't know I'm like Zachariah I need an answer now God's going to give you an answer okay because now look at number 10 on your notes and you'll find brother bramon why why we are not a denomination paragraph 180 585 uh excuse me 927 1958 look what he said he saw number 10 on your notes if you notice in Revelation 1 we find Jesus standing in the seven Church ages the seven golden candlesticks when he turned and saw one liken to the son of man like the son of man standing clo with a how was it it was a bride standing in the candlesticks drawn out now remember he's gir about the paps with a golden girdle which is femish you reading your scripture 13th verse gir about the PS with a golden girdle the prophet said that would be femish because the girdle would not be in that position they would have to be breasts and and all it would be femin not over the shoulder of Labor and the different things see all right so he saw that now what what did he see now go back to one the other when you have to pick it up it's no underlining and it's just page one Israel in Egypt 1953 325 now if you turn if had time to get these other scriptures in Revelation the first chapter that when John saw him standing one like unto the son of man standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks which was the seven Church ages and he starts off and I took this and took this and form and what it was look on down on the next one which is 52 of the church age book He's quoting that scripture one like unto the son of man there he stands one like unto the son of man as the is beautified by the beautified by the mounting of the ring so he is glorified in the midst of the churches it is the Lord's day for John sees him standing not as a priest but as the coming judge the gold gir is no longer gir about the waist where the priest must we it as he ministers to God in the holiest place but is now around his shoulders for he is not now the priest but the judge and where's he at in the bride in the bride so what is that John I saw one standing in the mid like unto the son of man he saw the bride he saw the word of God down Through the Ages now over in Chapter 2 he starts writing the message to each Church age all right and each one of those Church ages gets a revelation of the deity of Jesus Christ amen right they get an overcomer position they get all the things because he's already been shown here in Revelations 1 that's why I said go into the chap book The Book of Revelations and show me Jesus Christ anywhere by himself he said well what about the lamb it takes a book where the lamb come from your Prophet said the lamb come from the seven Church ages because the lamb has seven horns and seven eyes amen he he said the lamb comes from the church ages you see why it's been so long is we haven't seen the revelation of what is taking place it's revealing who we are and what's taking here in the last days because each age is the word of God made manifest the son of man is the word of God right you agree that's why Jesus kept saying who the man the son of man am he never declared himself to be the Son of God he declared himself to be the son of man right then he's Son of God down through the seven Church ages then he's to be son of man for just a little while and your Prophet said that the Bride of Jesus Christ would be the son of man made manifest I preached that in 1968 the first sermon I preached in this message that the Bride of Jesus Christ would be the son of man which would be the word made flesh again Theus word when he comes in with a headstone uniting and all like that and just for a moment the world is going to see the son of man all around the world but brother brandom was was no brother randam wasn't the son of man brother randam was a son of man yes that's what your Prophet says about it now come on he was not the son of man but to bride together around the world which is the revealed word will be the son of man that's where she shown standing here turned to see the voice that spoke to him and he did he saw the bride well why can't we read the book of Revelations and see ourselves amen what's wrong you get tied up in the symbol what does that symbol mean go ask the prophet what it means you don't have time to look it up call me I got mine written right on the side the pages L people say I ain't writing in the Bible That's the holy word well it's all right that's your wife say I want to write it down where I keep up with it cuz I wasn't in the days of the computer I was in the days when I had to remember what he said right brother we had to write it down man I I I feel so sorry for those people that try to take off what brother R says and put it in in tape form I mean book book form or write it down try it sometime take you a tape and let brother random preach and you try to write it down I don't care how fast you can write it you even that can type how much 120 words a minute or something some of you type or something you try to type off what he said you better go back and reread you will literally I have went word for word almost on a tape to take me hours to write a paragraph that much one paragraph take me an hour to write you know why because even the best I could listen I wouldn't hear what he said right that's right that's right that's what we had to depend on we had to write our own concordances of course did everybody the two Souls the seventh under virtue the Peruan all of them started putting out their their their uh their books you know you know what I got everyone in I got hold of why'd you get them you didn't agree no but they had a lot of good in their concordance first 15 pages prove where their Doctrine rest of it they settle down you can just read what you wanted so amen Jacob I will I'll use anything I can used to laugh at me they did when he go to Jeffersonville they go up and they give it'd be 700 people they'd be 500 books to give out to 700 people you've heard me tell about it we'd be sitting in the back realizing you know cuz we couldn't get no certain seats we get up front was okay right brother the house if you didn't you sat in the back if you're lucky shoot I would just go I'd get up I'd just go down through there like I looking for a seat I just looking looking like that and the brothers be taking the book and handed them out to the deacons that was passing them out and when they reach down in there I'd say thank you I guess they thought I was one of the deacons just got appointed or something but you know everybody ever went with us got a book oh you see I believe in the word Jacob I'm a Shyer when it comes to the word I'll do what I can to get the word amen I've put up with a lot of people in FKS doctrines to try to understand what they were talking about you said well that's silly brother Dale I'm just well that's all right that's your way that's right but listen can you see yourself in the word that's it the Bible reveals the Bride of Jesus Christ that's right do you understand we went through Zachariah in the Old Testament we've come to the New Testament of seven golden candlesticks showing the word of God living in a people and then people have the audacity to say that Luther and them was wrong sure a lot of their Doctrine was wrong but the word of the just you live by faith was what I stand on today cuz I believe it he may have sat in the pub and drank beer and talk about a Doctrine but there's one thing about it he had the word of God for that day and if you say he didn't then you're in trouble with almighty God so that's your choice listen Church John sees the same thing Zachariah sees John bows down as we were reading there to worship this one and he wouldn't let Him worship Him because he was still in Bride form oh if you'd ever get that down and then you can read the book of Revelation read the book of Revelation Revelation looking for yourself don't read it to try to figure out how many boms fall over here and what this Falls over there that falls over there like I said to you you'll find there one time The Book of Revelation it it states emphatically that there was an earthquake and 7,000 men died what about it needs to take when 300,000 di right well what we got to do then we got to look back through history and see if there's ever been where there was only 7,000 died that's not what I'm getting at the point of what I'm getting at if it was 7,000 was very important how much is 300,000 how much more do we see that we're in the plagues and the vials and the things are being poured out no we're not in the tribulation no cuz that's a wrath of God poured out upon mankind but we're in a pre-tribulation but in that pre-tribulation that's when the sons and God shine Sons and Daughters of God shine like the stars it's time now to stand on our feet as I said Wednesday night and say raise God out of history and talk about how real he is go outside we got to go doctor doctor said I got this well that's what you got cuz the doctor said you got it you believe it well you go the doctor sure do got one pretty quick got to go but you want to go with me and sit down and listen to me talk to them doctors sometime and tell them that God is either you're not that's right when you think you are I'll get up and leave out of this office I don't care how fancy a doctor they are that's right or how many what he's supposed to be I want to see God made manifest we're the big hindrances cuz we're not believing it if nothing else why not believe one thing I tried to make to you in a monsoon season You Don't Pray For Rain right right right right well it's got to get dry before you pray for rain and I don't understand why we hearing it's so dry we here because God is waiting on somebody to call it right somebody to say it and he'll back it up it's happened before stood here one night and I said it won't rain until I call for it it's on record in the takes back there and we went I don't know how long I came out here and I said the Lord just showed me that it's going to start raining now and it'll rain more than it's ever rained the newspaper in Gainesville said for the month of August of that year said they had never they had never been that much rain on record church I'm telling you we serve a living God yes but when we doubt what he's doing among us then we we hinder him from doing it believe that God is with you said I can't do I'm just so sick we having help us you got to be sick before you can get well before God can show the Healer somebody had to be sick but you know where we're missing that we think we got to have super duper faith I said the Lord was dealing with me about something on faith you know that the first man that was healed was not a Christian it probably had to be sure you know Cain or Abel or one of them or something or Adam and Eve who Born Again Christians you know what they believe God and God healed when now your Prophet said I didn't he did said you don't have to have a super duper Faith he said if you can have the same Faith the first person had that was healed God is obligated to heal you the first person that was saved in the Bible was 120 in the upper room of stinking rotten cowards that was draw back up there shaking in their shoe heels as we'd call it wondering what in the world is going to take place but you know how they got saved cuz God promised he'd send the Holy Ghost it wasn't their goodness do you know what it's not our goodness that's going to save us is when we can just get ourselves out of the way and believe God God is showing us right in the word anywhere you read is you anywhere you read it's you you can read that way it changes everything the prophet said what speaks of the groom speaks of the bride all right so now what do we oh we want to get by everything we don't know but no he he was beat and wounded and but brother Dale you don't think we going to have to do that he might choose for us to do that did he choose to allow people to go through the Dark Ages and give their life for the gospel come on he might choose for us to do those things and then what we're going to do GP and complain time to call God on the scene let's stand time to call God on the scene and begin to read the Bible for ourselves get rid of our bad dis glasses you know like I've always said you know all I can read now is about TOS everything I see is two Souls well get rid of them and read something for yourself and listen to the prophet amen that's what I love and I write it right down the side of it on the Bible the prophet said this is what this was talking about this is what that's talking about I listen to Big Man in this message one time and there's a bunch of them holling amen he was preaching about the scapegoats you remember there where they kill one and put the blood on turn the other one loose he said see there said they kill one and turn the other loose he's one they kill with Jesus when that turned loose with the devil he said brother randam said that I oh God I know he didn't say that Lord and I found it brought it up know as arrogant as I am you know brought it up you know what brother Bron said if you say one of them was Jesus and the other one was the devil you know what he said he said you're sacrificing to the devil that's what your Prophet said he said both of them goats was Jesus one died and the other would carried my sins away he said the devil can't carry your sins away you see we got such beautiful oh it just sounds wonderful thank you Jesus but what does the word say come on what does it say what we got found number 15 in the red book number 15 in the red book anybody have a need see I believe he's the same yesterday today and forever but I believe he's the same in every Church age he said no no he was yes he was he was a savior healer Redeemer

to her cuz she's there listening at home on the internet and thank God for the internet system that we can do those things but to think of where that it's going to be something for people one day you have to give an account for and a little old lady stands up and says well how far did you come to church and she said about 5 hours one way you know and it's going to be something that's going to be the thing you out understand front of us and then to somebody to say well well you know you wouldn't in church too often no I was sick so well now we had two people there in the church that you know
