[30:31] scriptures and and then we'll continue
[30:34] on but uh just pray that the Lord would
[30:37] would bless us because I've enjoyed this
[30:40] part of doing the series on the the
[30:43] seven comound names of Jehovah and I
[30:45] hope you have I hope it's been needful
[30:47] and really enjoyed to brother Matthew
[30:49] there last Wednesday and then brother
[30:52] Reed this weekend and I thought they
[30:54] came in and done a good job of boosting
[30:56] us up and fing on you know and to to see
[31:00] the Lord
[31:03] okay Hebrews
[31:06] 8:1 now the thing now of the things
[31:08] which we have spoken this is the psong
[31:12] we have such an high priest who is set
[31:15] on the right hand of the Throne of the
[31:17] Majesty in the
[31:19] heavens now go into
[31:22] Ecclesiastes as I said when Paul is
[31:24] finished they coming down through 7
[31:27] chapters and then he says that this is
[31:29] the PSM now we come down with
[31:31] Ecclesiastes the preacher as it's called
[31:34] as he's coming through delivering his
[31:36] message unto the children of Israel and
[31:38] he gets down to the 12th chapter and the
[31:40] 13th verse and says let us hear the
[31:43] conclusion of the whole
[31:46] matter now what is the conclusion of the
[31:48] whole matter fear God and keep his
[31:51] Commandments for this is the whole duty
[31:54] of man you may be seated The Lord At His
[31:57] listening to the reading of the
[31:59] word now we've been talking about
[32:04] the using this basically because there's
[32:07] I I know there's at least 10 or more uh
[32:10] Redemptive names of Jehovah and some are
[32:15] spelled different in different things
[32:17] you know so uh you know keep that in
[32:19] mind if you're studying along on the
[32:21] line but we've been trying to get a
[32:23] point across because I believe that it's
[32:26] been helpful to me anyway to see that uh
[32:31] you know there are seven compound
[32:34] names and each one of those names is
[32:37] related to an attribute from God and
[32:42] being that then it's displaying that
[32:46] attribute and and the point that I've
[32:48] tried to get us to look at to to keep
[32:51] saying over and
[32:53] over that you know God revealed himself
[32:57] to each one of
[32:59] these for the time of where they
[33:03] were all right so you know he he he does
[33:08] that in showing what he is all right and
[33:12] we covered up through the the the six of
[33:15] them we're up now to Jehovah Ray which
[33:18] is r a a h is where they spell it one of
[33:21] them one of them spelled it R o l so
[33:24] it's still you can turn to Psalms 23
[33:27] if you want to but the main thing I've
[33:31] been trying to get us to
[33:33] see
[33:36] now you can't make one any more value
[33:41] than the
[33:42] other now I I thought maybe somebody
[33:46] would come up with this idea and you
[33:48] know I had already thought about it
[33:51] and you know we we think that we know
[33:54] what we're talking about sometimes and
[33:55] we'll say uh well our brother Dale
[33:58] Jehovah Gyra is the greatest cuz that's
[34:00] the Lord's provided
[34:02] sacrifice well then I figured somebody
[34:05] had come up maybe with a with a quote
[34:07] like you know like a quote from Brother
[34:09] brandham which would be saying you know
[34:12] that uh you uh Divine Healing which is
[34:16] Jehovah
[34:18] RI that that's a that's you know that's
[34:20] not a a front run thing in other words
[34:23] it's it's a secondary thing but you know
[34:28] I was thinking somebody would come up
[34:29] with that and I was waiting but no one
[34:31] has anyway to think on it so maybe
[34:34] you've gotten the point of what I'm
[34:35] trying to
[34:36] make you can't preach him to be Jehovah
[34:40] Gyra right that the Lord's provided
[34:44] sacrifice unless you would preach him to
[34:46] be Jehovah
[34:47] rapi the Lord that Health thee because
[34:51] it would have to be the same you
[34:54] couldn't make one part greater than the
[34:56] other
[34:58] but make it to be what you have need
[35:01] of you know like I said then when he
[35:05] appears to Jehovah Gyra to
[35:10] Abraham he needed a sacrifice all right
[35:14] now he didn't appear to him as Jehovah
[35:19] rapi the Lord had health your diseases
[35:23] because that was not what Abraham was
[35:25] needing remember remember that I kept
[35:27] trying to
[35:29] emphasize God Appears to us as to what
[35:33] we have need of for the time that we're
[35:38] in all right now that will be valuable
[35:41] along about Sunday morning because I
[35:44] made the statement to you that you know
[35:46] and I'll get to it Sunday the Lord
[35:48] willing that
[35:50] uh out of all of these things that we
[35:53] studied we haven't talked about the
[35:56] rapture
[35:58] we haven't put that part in yet because
[36:02] there is a a reason for that now but
[36:08] think of
[36:10] it now if you need him as a
[36:14] savior then he will not be revealing
[36:17] himself to you as a Healer as I
[36:21] said you need him as a
[36:24] Healer he would not reveal himself to to
[36:26] you as a
[36:28] banner or his
[36:33] righteousness he would reveal himself to
[36:35] you for whatever you have need of what
[36:37] whatever it is if you're needing a
[36:38] savior he'll reveal to you that
[36:42] part if you need a Healer he'll reveal
[36:45] to you that that he's a
[36:48] Healer because he's not having to reveal
[36:51] all of them in the
[36:54] same uh point
[36:57] now you'll see what I'm talking about
[37:01] Sunday
[37:02] but he reveals whatever is needed for
[37:06] the
[37:08] time that's the way I believe God
[37:10] reveals himself amen for whatever we
[37:13] have need of that is what he's going to
[37:16] make manifest to you and
[37:19] I you know you're needing him as a
[37:23] savior you wouldn't be saying Lord want
[37:25] you to heal me
[37:28] you're praying for a
[37:30] savior then he would speak to you about
[37:32] that so it's whatever is
[37:35] needful for the
[37:38] time so keep that in your mind now
[37:41] whatever what you have need of is what
[37:44] God is going to be dealing with us about
[37:48] that so we can be right here in the
[37:51] building and he he can be revealing
[37:53] himself
[37:55] tonight and in all of his manifestations
[37:58] right because there's enough people here
[38:01] for him to reveal to individual people
[38:04] that's
[38:05] right what they have need of all right
[38:09] now see that's the kind of God I
[38:12] believe you know I believe he's whatever
[38:15] that we have need
[38:17] of you
[38:19] know we need a savior he's a savior we
[38:22] need a Healer he's a
[38:25] Healer if we need peace in our heart
[38:28] then he's our
[38:32] peace but see it's whatever is needful
[38:35] for the
[38:37] time right
[38:39] so Paul is
[38:42] saying to bring this down to a
[38:47] sum words Su up what I've been
[38:52] saying then here's what it is we have
[38:56] such a great high
[39:00] priest right now in dealing in the high
[39:05] priest
[39:08] realm now I think women a minute on what
[39:11] I'm saying in dealing in the high priest
[39:15] realm the high priest has
[39:18] many many
[39:21] things that is made manifest through the
[39:24] high priest H right all right now now
[39:29] get the point saying see someone comes
[39:33] along and and they need a
[39:36] savior well the high priest will offer a
[39:40] lamb
[39:42] right see because that's what you have
[39:44] need of but if you're
[39:47] sick it may be a turtled
[39:50] of that he would offer
[39:54] right so he has to know what to
[39:57] do so you come up to him and you say you
[40:01] know I I would just like to have the
[40:04] peace of God in my
[40:06] heart he said well all right we'll find
[40:10] out that I told you if you'll go and
[40:12] check these you'll find an offering
[40:14] related to each right there is one
[40:17] called a peace
[40:18] offering
[40:21] righten and see then that offering that
[40:24] high priest would to know what to
[40:27] do so that's what Paul see the point I
[40:30] what I'm getting at Paul says the sum of
[40:35] this we have such a high
[40:37] priest in other words paraphrasing it we
[40:41] have one that knows what we have need of
[40:46] it's not that the scripture that your
[40:48] Lord knows what you have need of before
[40:50] you ever
[40:52] asked so then that's the high priest and
[40:55] we'll get to that l later to bring it
[40:57] back but as I said now watch keep the
[41:00] point
[41:03] see you wouldn't ask for
[41:06] a A Healer if you're not
[41:11] sick you may need something
[41:14] else but God is to each one of
[41:18] us what we have need of what a wonderful
[41:22] God Amen what about a high priest yes
[41:27] a high priest that would keep up and
[41:29] know just what to
[41:32] do cuz this offering here I mean they've
[41:35] got all kind of offerings in the Bible
[41:38] right and you got an offering for this
[41:41] you got an offering for that y uh like a
[41:44] a baby being born they was a special
[41:48] offering then they have had to have like
[41:50] the the little boy when he come to you
[41:53] know 8 days old and circumcising then
[41:56] you have little offerings to take along
[41:58] or something there was something in
[42:01] relationship for what you have need of
[42:04] does everybody understand what I'm
[42:05] trying to get the point whatever we have
[42:07] need of that is what he is
[42:10] amen and see being that
[42:13] then we come down and we we've got to to
[42:17] all of them I said we'd use the the last
[42:19] one which is Jehovah r r a h h r r o
[42:27] HL because they spell it two different
[42:30] ways but it simply means the Lord is Our
[42:33] Shepherd so now let's just go to the to
[42:37] the 23rd
[42:39] psalm and I I gave you this and brother
[42:43] Joe to kind of blow it up and and get it
[42:46] fixed where we can see a little better
[42:52] but see and I've got another paper that
[42:55] uh when I started into this sister Jean
[42:58] Sunday brought a paper that brother
[43:00] Ernie Villa NOA had brought to us I
[43:02] don't know how long ago but it was
[43:05] talking about the seven the 10 10
[43:09] Redemptive names of Jehovah that's
[43:11] counted in the Psalms 23 and if you'd
[43:14] like that I'd be glad to to get you a
[43:16] copy of it but the reason I said what I
[43:19] did that there are seven compound names
[43:22] because all of it is related into that
[43:25] right point so now let's read Psalms
[43:31] 23 and read it
[43:33] as you know as it would be reading
[43:38] it with the name there in other words
[43:41] all
[43:42] right so look what it says now the Lord
[43:46] is my Jehovah Rea r a h a now don't ask
[43:51] me to pronounce some of these correct
[43:52] because you just get it read spell
[43:55] it
[43:56] but what is it the Lord is my
[43:59] shepherd so that's what that word means
[44:01] Jehovah R means the Lord is my shepherd
[44:04] right all right now watch I shall
[44:07] not Jehovah
[44:11] Gyra I shall not
[44:14] want because he's whatever I have need
[44:16] of He's My
[44:20] Sacrifice he maketh me to lie down in
[44:23] Green Pastures in other words he maketh
[44:25] me to lie down in Jehovah
[44:29] Shalom which means he is my peace
[44:33] amen now look what the psalmist David
[44:37] was doing and that's the reason I save
[44:40] this look what the psalmist David was
[44:44] doing to sum
[44:46] up in technically five verses because
[44:50] the LI is a statement about what this
[44:53] will bring to us like surely goodness
[44:55] and mercy shall me that is that's more
[44:57] or less an outward manifestation of what
[45:00] the five verses but look what the
[45:03] psalmist David was saying see he maketh
[45:06] me to lie
[45:07] down in green pasture Jehovah
[45:10] Shalom his
[45:13] peace he leadth me beside the Ste Waters
[45:17] Jehovah Rahab which would be the
[45:19] shepherd He leading you to the to the
[45:21] place
[45:23] amen he restoreth my
[45:26] Soul Jehovah rapi which means a Healer r
[45:30] a p
[45:32] h he leadth me in the paths of
[45:36] righteousness and what is that Jehovah T
[45:41] you cuz he's our
[45:45] righteousness y though I walk to the
[45:47] Valley of the shadow of death I will
[45:49] fear no evil why because he's Jehovah
[45:52] Nasha in I SS I which which means our
[45:57] Banner so you don't have to worry about
[45:59] walking through the valley of the Shadow
[46:01] death why because somebody's with you
[46:04] he's not just with you he's raising up a
[46:07] banner
[46:09] okay for thou art with me Jehova shamama
[46:12] which means present or his presence
[46:18] right thy rod and thy St they comfort me
[46:22] Jehovah Rahab which would be right back
[46:24] to your Shepherd amen
[46:27] verse 5 thou preparest a table before me
[46:30] in the presence of mine enemies there
[46:32] you go right back to the
[46:35] banner a sign a
[46:37] signant thou anointest my head with o
[46:40] Jehovah RI he's the
[46:43] Healer my cup
[46:46] runthe Gyra
[46:49] amen now you just think
[46:52] about how a man could be led
[46:57] you believe the psalmist David was led
[46:58] in the spirit cuz the Bible said that
[47:01] David said in the spirit so you know the
[47:04] writing of the Psalms is you know not
[47:08] just David crying out of this it's
[47:12] actually God speaking to a man amen and
[47:16] what about taking five
[47:18] verses and covering the
[47:23] full part of the Redemption of man right
[47:28] the Healer the Savior the banner the
[47:30] righteousness the
[47:32] peace the
[47:34] presence all in final
[47:41] verses can we do
[47:45] that do we said no we're just looking
[47:47] for this now somebody sent this along
[47:50] and I thought it was good enough and
[47:52] read
[47:54] it so let's read the 23rd psalm again
[47:57] over in this way the Lord is my
[48:00] shepherd that's
[48:03] relationship I shall not want that's
[48:07] Supply he maketh me to lie down in Green
[48:10] Pastures that's
[48:11] rest he leadth me beside the Still
[48:14] Waters that's
[48:16] refreshment he restoreth my soul that's
[48:19] healing he leadth me in the path of
[48:22] righteousness that's guidance for his
[48:24] name's sake
[48:26] that's
[48:28] purpose yay though I walk through the
[48:31] valley of the shadow of death that's
[48:34] testing and will fear no evil that's
[48:38] protection for thou art with me that's
[48:42] faithfulness thy rod and thy staff they
[48:44] comfort me that's
[48:48] discipline now prepare as the table
[48:50] before me in the presence of my enemies
[48:53] that's
[48:54] hope thou anointest my head with oil
[48:58] that's consec consecration
[49:02] you my cup runneth over that's
[49:06] abundance surely goodness and mercy
[49:08] shall follow me all the days of my life
[49:11] that's
[49:12] blessings and I will dwell in the house
[49:15] of the Lord
[49:16] forever that's security that's
[49:21] eternity all within the 23rd
[49:24] psalm
[49:26] that we teach our children to
[49:31] memorize that's
[49:33] wonderful you know you know to get a
[49:36] star in a lot of places you got to be
[49:37] able
[49:39] to quote the 23rd
[49:42] PSAL but do we read it to really get the
[49:47] depth out of
[49:48] it cuz everything David
[49:53] needed was covered in the 23rd psalm
[49:58] right he needed a savior he needed a
[50:02] Healer he needed a banner he needed
[50:07] righteousness he needed peace he needed
[50:10] his
[50:12] presence all the
[50:15] things it might make us think a little
[50:18] bit of difference about and what I done
[50:21] I just went through
[50:23] mine and I marked it down and wrote like
[50:27] where it says the Lord is my shepherd I
[50:29] put Jehovah rayon there you know and
[50:34] then I put the other one to keep up with
[50:38] it but think about how
[50:41] perfect the word of God Amen so you
[50:45] would think you would have to read the
[50:46] entire Bible to find all the Redemptive
[50:50] names to find all the attributes of
[50:53] almighty God that you would have to
[50:56] write a book you
[50:59] know you'd have to have a a great
[51:02] discourse to
[51:04] cover but the psalmist David y could put
[51:07] it all there in just
[51:10] a a few verses
[51:14] amen can we sum up our Christian
[51:18] experience in the 23rd psalm right can
[51:22] we look at it you know to find ourselves
[51:29] can we find our peace in the word of
[51:33] God right amen can we find our Salvation
[51:37] in the word of
[51:39] God can we find a Healer in the
[51:44] word maybe it is because that we don't
[51:47] value all the
[51:50] same and we try to make one thing
[51:52] greater than the other
[51:59] but how can you do that when you're
[52:00] dealing with the revealing of an eternal
[52:07] God the smallest amount of anything that
[52:11] God could reveal to
[52:15] mankind would be more Superior than
[52:18] anything you and I could ever comprehend
[52:22] to
[52:24] be
[52:26] like we talk about a a spoonful of water
[52:29] out of the
[52:32] ocean the only difference is in
[52:37] volume but that's what I've been trying
[52:39] to get us to
[52:43] see is he greater because of being a
[52:47] savior to
[52:52] Abraham would that be greater than to be
[52:56] a a
[52:59] banner you know for who was it that we
[53:03] covered it
[53:06] huh where run off all of them the got to
[53:09] Gideon
[53:12] Gideon what is the difference see it's
[53:14] the point of what God reveals himself to
[53:19] you and I
[53:24] right
[53:26] he may not ever reveal to you that
[53:30] you're
[53:35] healed because we may cut off the
[53:38] channel it keeps him from being able to
[53:40] reveal it to
[53:42] us looking for it in a certain way or a
[53:45] certain thing but does that mean he's
[53:48] not the
[53:52] Healer well brother D he's never done
[53:54] this for me me or done that he's never
[53:56] raised up a banner when I was in trouble
[53:59] and things but you're still
[54:02] alive that's right
[54:05] amen remember I told you about the man
[54:07] there at work one day and
[54:08] he he said talking about something about
[54:11] the Catholics I was and he said how many
[54:14] are there I said well at the time I
[54:15] think there's about 500 million he said
[54:18] you mean there's 500 million of them
[54:20] wrong and you're right I said I didn't
[54:22] say that I said the word's right if I'm
[54:25] with the word then I'm right
[54:29] right he said well if that be that way
[54:31] about doing it why are you
[54:34] sick if you're thinking that much about
[54:36] the
[54:38] word I thought for a minute and didn't
[54:40] want to answer him sarcastically I
[54:42] wanted to answer him in love and I
[54:44] finally looked at him I said well I'm
[54:46] not
[54:48] dead you know I mean I didn't want to be
[54:51] sarcastic I just said I'm not dead and
[54:53] he apologized you know you know for
[54:56] making a sarcastic
[54:59] remark but you understand what I've been
[55:01] trying to get at right now Sunday we're
[55:03] going to bring all of this around into
[55:07] and tie it together to look at the
[55:12] Rapture because as I said all of these
[55:14] Redemptive names
[55:17] here are dealing with where we
[55:21] are
[55:24] life right Abraham didn't need a
[55:29] Rapture
[55:31] right
[55:32] right he needed a savior he needed a
[55:36] sacrifice right you
[55:39] know and God gave him what he had need
[55:44] of but what about the psalmist David
[55:47] coming to a position that God could take
[55:50] five verses and cover all of these
[55:53] things right
[55:57] amen he's a wonderful savior
[56:00] am he's a great God he's a great Eternal
[56:03] in him amen but you
[56:06] see David could see and
[56:09] realize that the Lord was present with
[56:12] him
[56:14] right so he can go back through all the
[56:17] Psalms and remember the
[56:19] things like the time he said you
[56:23] know could remember Me Maybe reading job
[56:27] where job said if I make my bed in
[56:30] hell said you're with
[56:33] me now job wasn't going to hell and that
[56:37] wasn't the point what was the point the
[56:40] point was showing how s how sure are the
[56:44] promises of God that he'll always be
[56:46] with
[56:47] us that it would be possible to cast me
[56:51] into hell that God would be there amen
[56:54] but it's not not possible to be able to
[56:56] do that why because he saved
[57:00] me so that's what job was
[57:04] saying he wouldn't say one of these days
[57:06] I'm going to die and go to hell the Lord
[57:07] you'll be there no no no no he's saying
[57:11] if
[57:12] necessary for it to take
[57:15] place you understand what I'm trying to
[57:17] say all the attributes of
[57:20] God are shown right there in Psalms 23
[57:23] amen
[57:25] find some other attribute that would not
[57:27] be related to what we just
[57:31] read cuz all the other ones are like
[57:34] Jehovah
[57:35] Manasseh that was when uh the boys were
[57:39] born to
[57:41] Jacob Isaac was
[57:45] it get it right Joseph Joseph two sons
[57:49] and when it comes to Jehovah Manasses he
[57:52] said that was what was written there in
[57:54] the script scures and that's what he
[57:56] titled cuz he named his son
[58:00] Manasses you've heard brother Brown talk
[58:03] about when those babies was were born
[58:06] that even in the birth and the naming of
[58:10] the
[58:11] child that it would literally Place
[58:14] those
[58:15] people he said I can show
[58:18] you that they're exactly where God said
[58:21] that they would be right now I wish he
[58:25] had to put that out where we could see
[58:28] it I remember talking about one time
[58:30] about the the vine that went over the
[58:33] wall he said that was the ones that come
[58:34] to the United
[58:37] States see he could have went through
[58:39] there and told us all the thing but it's
[58:41] not necessary it would just be nice
[58:46] knowing but if God is our savior now
[58:51] here's the point I want to drive to make
[58:53] you make sure you don't miss Mis
[58:55] understand
[58:56] meaning he can be our
[59:02] healer and not be our
[59:06] savior right
[59:08] right he can be your healer and not be
[59:11] your
[59:13] savior so I don't want to be the fact
[59:16] that you think that I would be putting
[59:18] it all in if you get one you get it
[59:22] all I'm not been con considering
[59:26] that I'm saying if you get Christ you
[59:29] got all amen that's
[59:32] right if you get Christ you got all the
[59:35] Redemptive
[59:40] names but you see then he can be
[59:43] something to someone and not be that to
[59:46] another person
[59:48] right but he'll be what you ask him
[59:53] about
[59:58] see then he reveals
[59:59] himself to each one of these in the Old
[1:00:04] Testament for whatever is
[1:00:09] needed at the time
[1:00:11] right
[1:00:14] okay see then by being what is
[1:00:22] needed then
[1:00:25] that would make it manifest in the body
[1:00:28] of
[1:00:29] Christ that we would all together as one
[1:00:33] body we would be making him
[1:00:41] manifest I mean the man that we were the
[1:00:44] prayer request that's going to be
[1:00:46] executed because he taught the
[1:00:49] Christian to convert the Muslim to
[1:00:52] Christianity now
[1:00:55] he he needs a
[1:00:57] savior right he he don't need a
[1:01:01] Healer he needs a
[1:01:03] savior so the desperation for what you
[1:01:07] have need of are you listening will
[1:01:10] bring upon the
[1:01:14] scene would you have
[1:01:16] need have you ever been to a place that
[1:01:19] you
[1:01:20] were just so burdened
[1:01:25] that you really didn't even
[1:01:32] understand you know you ever been out
[1:01:34] way you ever been dis burdened about
[1:01:37] something see then when you're doing
[1:01:39] that you need
[1:01:41] peace that's
[1:01:43] right you need his presence to come to
[1:01:46] you yeah but you need peace
[1:01:53] yes what do we pray
[1:01:58] for well I really I just I just pray in
[1:02:01] a lump s yeah that's why we don't get
[1:02:04] what we're asking for we pray in a lump
[1:02:08] s well God knows what I
[1:02:12] need that's
[1:02:15] true he says he knows what you need
[1:02:17] before you pray but did he tell you not
[1:02:20] to pray right no he told you to
[1:02:26] pray he was the lord of the Harvest and
[1:02:30] standing there and say pray that the
[1:02:31] lord of the Harvest would send labor
[1:02:34] into the
[1:02:36] field why because he wanted us to have
[1:02:38] something to do
[1:02:41] with has he ever been personal to
[1:02:47] you I mean have you have you ever just
[1:02:51] like I said have you ever been just
[1:02:52] burdened about something in and all at
[1:02:55] once peace just
[1:02:59] come you ever done
[1:03:03] that you ever need
[1:03:07] healing and then just all at
[1:03:10] once a peace comes upon you and says
[1:03:13] right I Stripes I'm
[1:03:18] Healed he's manifesting
[1:03:22] himself but when we get it to the point
[1:03:24] that we try to to make is I keep
[1:03:26] emphasizing make one greater than the
[1:03:29] other one we're limiting God Amen
[1:03:34] right I I want to magnify his attributes
[1:03:37] amen instead of trying to limit
[1:03:40] them you
[1:03:45] know brother R says God wants to heal
[1:03:48] you more than you want to be
[1:03:53] healed right
[1:03:55] right now how many of you sick or been
[1:03:59] sick and wanted to be healed amen see
[1:04:03] God wanted you heal more than you want
[1:04:04] to be
[1:04:06] healed cuz he's
[1:04:09] not he's he can't get Glory out of a
[1:04:11] body that's
[1:04:15] sick he can use things to bring us to a
[1:04:17] place yeah but he wants us healed amen
[1:04:22] he wants us delivered
[1:04:28] but our problem is like that we want
[1:04:30] peace we want his
[1:04:32] presence he said I'm with
[1:04:36] you I'm with you
[1:04:39] always but yet we pray for him to come
[1:04:42] to
[1:04:44] us my brother R said you don't need
[1:04:50] Faith what' he say he said you already
[1:04:53] have it
[1:04:57] so if you got the new
[1:04:59] birth you've got
[1:05:02] faith but yet we pray for Faith now that
[1:05:06] don't mean we don't pray for revelation
[1:05:08] of God's word come on now
[1:05:11] don't but get what I'm trying to
[1:05:16] say he comes for whatever we have need
[1:05:23] of
[1:05:24] that's the kind of God that I believe
[1:05:30] in he's on the
[1:05:34] scene you ever got into a a discussion
[1:05:38] Etc maybe with
[1:05:39] somebody and you can see that they're
[1:05:42] not you know they're not getting what
[1:05:44] you're talking about and you you are
[1:05:47] struggling for trying to find something
[1:05:49] to
[1:05:52] say well see that's the worst thing
[1:05:54] thing to do because they struggling
[1:05:55] you'll automatically cut yourself off
[1:05:57] just
[1:06:01] relax just relax a
[1:06:03] little the first thing you know it'll
[1:06:06] come but if you ever notice too that
[1:06:10] when you leave talking with someone and
[1:06:11] you start down the street or somewhere
[1:06:13] and you're walking along you say well I
[1:06:15] should have said this and brother R said
[1:06:18] God didn't want you to say that he said
[1:06:20] because if he had he brought it to your
[1:06:23] attention
[1:06:27] what I'm trying to say is why can't we
[1:06:30] realize
[1:06:32] folks that God is in command of
[1:06:36] everything it's not me and
[1:06:41] you it's
[1:06:44] him he is our peace he is our joy he's
[1:06:47] our all in all he's my savior he's my
[1:06:50] healer he's my banner he's my
[1:06:53] righteousness
[1:06:56] and he's a very present help in a time
[1:06:58] of
[1:06:59] trouble right amen but when we get in
[1:07:05] trouble we have a tendency to try to
[1:07:07] call on God
[1:07:10] right but how do we try to do
[1:07:15] it do we try to bargain with
[1:07:20] it that won't do no
[1:07:22] good
[1:07:24] let thing do just stand
[1:07:26] there what was brother Brown said about
[1:07:28] Billy Graham when he went overseas he
[1:07:30] wasn't making fun of
[1:07:32] him those people challenged him right he
[1:07:36] said he should have just stood there Yen
[1:07:39] y I don't believe God would let the man
[1:07:44] down he said well I don't agree with
[1:07:46] anywh that's all right you don't do what
[1:07:48] you want to I'm trying to get a point
[1:07:50] God wouldn't have let the man down if he
[1:07:52] just stood there
[1:07:57] right but I'm kind of like the children
[1:07:59] the three the three Hebrew
[1:08:01] children that made a good point by
[1:08:04] saying
[1:08:05] what we believe that God's going to
[1:08:07] deliver us but them the lot
[1:08:11] nonetheless we're not going to bow
[1:08:16] down be positive and make the statement
[1:08:20] and then watch him come on the scene to
[1:08:22] the statement right
[1:08:28] have you ever had it to where that you
[1:08:30] say this is the way it's going to be you
[1:08:35] ever had that I don't mean a thought or
[1:08:38] a you know a
[1:08:41] good thought in your mind of what it
[1:08:43] ought to be I'm talking about this is
[1:08:46] the way it's going to
[1:08:47] be you ever had that to
[1:08:52] happen well is isn't he trying to get us
[1:08:55] get us to realize he's
[1:08:57] personal
[1:08:59] present
[1:09:02] je but are you understanding my whole
[1:09:05] point now this is what I want to get
[1:09:09] David was capable of summing
[1:09:13] up in five
[1:09:17] verses the complete Redemptive plan and
[1:09:22] presence of all Mighty God and what God
[1:09:25] would
[1:09:26] do how he would reveal
[1:09:31] himself in all in a few
[1:09:36] verses didn't take him a week didn't
[1:09:38] have to write 100
[1:09:40] chapters he wrote five
[1:09:43] verses y Brother Gary summed up
[1:09:46] everything we have need
[1:09:48] of that's right
[1:09:51] what the Lord is my shepherd
[1:09:57] you don't belong to nobody
[1:10:03] else come on read it for
[1:10:06] yourself if you ever just what i' invite
[1:10:09] you let's see what is
[1:10:12] it Psalms 22
[1:10:18] is Psalms 22 if you ever want to read it
[1:10:21] to find out about the things that
[1:10:23] happened to Calvary read Psalms 22 where
[1:10:26] they pierce my hands and my feet and all
[1:10:27] the different things but if you ever
[1:10:32] read psalms
[1:10:37] 21 to really read
[1:10:41] it let's read that it'll get you to the
[1:10:44] point of what I'm trying to
[1:10:46] say let's read psalms
[1:10:50] 21 let's read it like
[1:10:52] this
[1:10:59] and this is literally the way I have it
[1:11:01] written in my
[1:11:02] Bible I'll read to you what I got
[1:11:04] written
[1:11:07] here he says the king I wrote
[1:11:11] people so the people shall re shall joy
[1:11:15] in thy strength oh Lord and thy
[1:11:20] salvation how greatly we
[1:11:24] Rejoice now you read it there and you'll
[1:11:26] see he and all like that but this is the
[1:11:30] way I got it
[1:11:32] written because become personal to me
[1:11:35] verse
[1:11:36] two thou Hast given
[1:11:41] us our heart's
[1:11:47] desire and has not
[1:11:49] withholden the
[1:11:52] request
[1:11:54] of our
[1:11:55] lips for us
[1:11:59] CE for thou preventest
[1:12:02] us with the
[1:12:04] blessings of the goodness thou set us
[1:12:08] the
[1:12:09] crown of pure gold on our head now he's
[1:12:13] talking about the king the king is he
[1:12:15] you know he's talking about his own self
[1:12:18] right David's talking about
[1:12:22] hisself okay I'm talking about
[1:12:30] me we asked Life Of Thee and thou gave
[1:12:35] us gave it us even Length of days
[1:12:39] forever and ever amen our glory is great
[1:12:42] in thy
[1:12:44] salvation honor and Majesty H has thou
[1:12:46] laid upon
[1:12:49] us for thou H has made us Most Blessed
[1:12:52] forever
[1:12:54] thou H has made us exceeding great with
[1:12:57] thy
[1:13:01] countenance for the people trusteth in
[1:13:04] the Lord and through the mercy of the
[1:13:06] most high We Shall Not Be
[1:13:11] Moved thine hand shall find out all thy
[1:13:16] enemies and that's I left that thy right
[1:13:19] hand shall find out those that hate thee
[1:13:25] because that's
[1:13:27] us Thou shalt make them a fiery oven in
[1:13:31] the time of thine anger look what he's
[1:13:33] promising to do and the Lord shall
[1:13:35] swallow them up in his wrath and the
[1:13:38] fire shall devire them that's the
[1:13:40] enemies enemies enemies enemies
[1:13:43] enemies their fruit the enemy's fruit
[1:13:47] shallal thou destroy from the earth and
[1:13:50] their seed from among the children of
[1:13:52] men y
[1:13:54] the enemy's
[1:13:56] seat for thou intended evil against thee
[1:14:00] for they intended evil against it they
[1:14:03] imagine the mischievous device which
[1:14:06] they are not able to
[1:14:09] perform therefore shalt thou make them
[1:14:12] turn their back when thou shalt Make
[1:14:15] Ready thine arrows upon thy strings
[1:14:18] against the face of
[1:14:20] them be thou exalted Lord in Thine Own
[1:14:25] Strength for so we
[1:14:28] sing and praise not
[1:14:35] power something happened that day when I
[1:14:37] wrote
[1:14:39] that that brought the presence from
[1:14:43] talking about David and the
[1:14:50] King until I saw it was me
[1:14:55] can you read the Bible out
[1:14:58] way we look through the Bible to find
[1:15:01] all the things it talks about uh like
[1:15:03] Psalms 23 my God my God why has thou
[1:15:05] forsaken me where did that happen on
[1:15:09] Calvary David So entered the spirit
[1:15:12] Psalms 22
[1:15:14] verse1 read that whole chapter there he
[1:15:17] so entered the spirit until he was
[1:15:19] speaking into the first
[1:15:22] person well why can't we do
[1:15:28] that like white said I'm reading about
[1:15:30] Abraham but it ain't Abraham I'm talking
[1:15:34] about it's me
[1:15:38] amen this is my
[1:15:42] Bible this is written about
[1:15:45] me you must believe
[1:15:49] that and then when you need help turn in
[1:15:52] there and read what it is you ever get
[1:15:55] down and out read
[1:15:59] psalms and look what a man without the
[1:16:02] Holy Ghost yeah could be led to
[1:16:07] say that's why I chose to bring this one
[1:16:09] this one message of the 23rd psalm amen
[1:16:14] that in five
[1:16:15] verses the psalmist David could cover
[1:16:18] all the Redemptive names of Jehovah God
[1:16:25] bring it out of where it we can
[1:16:32] understand and put it
[1:16:34] there that he's my
[1:16:37] shepherd I want I'm no problem wanting
[1:16:41] because he's already provided the
[1:16:43] sacrifice he maketh me to lie down he
[1:16:46] bring
[1:16:47] peace to me he leadth me beside the
[1:16:50] still wat as a Good Shepherd that's
[1:16:52] where he he
[1:16:54] lead he restoreth my soul in other words
[1:16:57] he Health
[1:16:58] me I am the Lord that Health all of thy
[1:17:01] diseases he leadth me in the paths of
[1:17:04] righteousness Jo this can you he's our
[1:17:09] righteousness what is he he prepared a
[1:17:12] table for me in the presence of my
[1:17:14] enemies he's my banner he's my
[1:17:18] peace and he's ever
[1:17:22] present
[1:17:24] the psalmist David would sit there and
[1:17:26] cry in the
[1:17:27] spirit and these wonderful
[1:17:30] words would be transmitted from his
[1:17:36] heart because he
[1:17:39] understood what God was trying to
[1:17:44] say and you never pay close attention to
[1:17:48] the writers of the
[1:17:52] Bible
[1:17:53] that you're talking about
[1:17:59] yourself
[1:18:02] right wouldn't Moses talking about
[1:18:04] himself wouldn't Joshua talking about
[1:18:07] himself wouldn't David talking about
[1:18:10] himself wasn't it written about
[1:18:17] him the Bible was written about you and
[1:18:21] I
[1:18:24] see there's where the
[1:18:26] Rapture has to tie
[1:18:32] together because it's only the
[1:18:35] Redemptive names will deal with this
[1:18:38] journey of
[1:18:42] life but something must take place to
[1:18:45] bring a Rapture
[1:18:50] right cuz there's no Rapture just
[1:18:53] because you're saved now you will
[1:18:55] automatically go in it but you go by the
[1:18:56] grave
[1:18:58] right cuz you're healed is not Rapture
[1:19:05] right even his presence that we just got
[1:19:08] to speaking about of the second coming
[1:19:10] of Jesus
[1:19:13] Christ and being his coming being
[1:19:17] here and his presence being right
[1:19:21] here that's still not to
[1:19:27] Rapture I leave that for you to think
[1:19:30] about
[1:19:32] you we could be like David and going
[1:19:36] through all of these
[1:19:39] things but David wasn't raptured
[1:19:44] right he's depending on somebody
[1:19:49] else so all we used in the Redemptive
[1:19:53] names were all Old
[1:19:57] Testament
[1:20:03] revealings now we've got to enter the
[1:20:05] New
[1:20:10] Testament to find a
[1:20:14] Rapture to be able to go
[1:20:17] away what do you mean he's my healer
[1:20:20] he's my savior right
[1:20:26] but there's Millions down through
[1:20:28] time that are still
[1:20:31] waiting on you and I according to
[1:20:33] Hebrews
[1:20:35] 11:40 that they without us cannot be
[1:20:37] made
[1:20:43] perfect you and I must find our
[1:20:47] place in the word of God
[1:20:50] right as to what is to be be revealed in
[1:20:53] our
[1:20:58] day not what was revealed to
[1:21:01] David oh that's part of it yeah come on
[1:21:07] folks but you got to be something
[1:21:09] personal to me and
[1:21:12] you somebody's going to stand right here
[1:21:15] just like we do with healing and say by
[1:21:17] Stripes I'm Healed when the
[1:21:20] manifestation has not come into reality
[1:21:22] yet
[1:21:24] right somebody's going to have to stand
[1:21:26] here and say I'm already
[1:21:29] raptured well you know what they'll do
[1:21:31] they get a straight jacket for you even
[1:21:34] the Believers will right because they
[1:21:37] won't know what you're talking
[1:21:42] about but somebody's got to come to a
[1:21:46] place that they can understand our day
[1:21:50] and its
[1:21:51] message
[1:21:54] but if we don't read the Bible for
[1:21:56] ourselves about
[1:22:00] ourselves
[1:22:02] right then we'll never come to the place
[1:22:05] to walk off this
[1:22:08] Earth but if the psalmist David could
[1:22:10] conclude in five
[1:22:13] verses the entire Redemptive plan of
[1:22:17] mankind you
[1:22:19] know of the things while we're here on
[1:22:21] Earth
[1:22:25] why can't we take the entire
[1:22:28] Bible and come to a
[1:22:31] place to walk off this
[1:22:37] Earth maybe it's what I said when I
[1:22:40] tried to preach from talking about you
[1:22:43] know
[1:22:44] that all of these are cannot be
[1:22:49] separated but we cannot make one of more
[1:22:51] equal value you than the
[1:22:54] other cuz when we do we're limiting God
[1:22:58] because I'll give you the key it will
[1:23:01] take all of his seven Redemptive names
[1:23:04] revealed to put us in a position to walk
[1:23:07] off the earth in a Rapture amen you're
[1:23:09] not going off the Earth without a
[1:23:14] Healer you think you're going to be
[1:23:15] changed the moment twinkle eye and go to
[1:23:17] meet the Lord in the A and you're going
[1:23:19] up with one leg missing or limping or 70
[1:23:22] years old in her whole
[1:23:25] body now something wrong
[1:23:28] there but just
[1:23:31] remember the
[1:23:33] key it will have to transpire
[1:23:37] here that's right it won't be when we
[1:23:41] get
[1:23:44] dark that's simple that's a good old
[1:23:47] Baptist Doctrine bless God I don't want
[1:23:49] to worry about this smoking CU going get
[1:23:52] me a new
[1:23:54] body I'm not making a joke out of it or
[1:23:56] throwing off on they were saying what
[1:23:59] they
[1:24:02] believe you haven't never noticed one
[1:24:06] thing I mean have you really ever
[1:24:10] noticed that brother randam and he was
[1:24:13] explaining it I was thinking about this
[1:24:14] the other
[1:24:18] day you know in the days of John Wesley
[1:24:22] under
[1:24:24] sanctification you know there was a lot
[1:24:26] of songs that we still sing and thank
[1:24:29] God for them now don't
[1:24:33] misunderstand
[1:24:35] but a lot of those songs was about the
[1:24:41] blood
[1:24:44] right cuz you know what they believed in
[1:24:46] that
[1:24:48] day they believed you were
[1:24:51] sanctified they believed you were born
[1:24:55] again John Wesley didn't just teach say
[1:24:57] sanctification only he Tau
[1:24:59] sanctification as the baptism of the
[1:25:02] Holy Ghost right I've got his writings
[1:25:04] if you'd like to
[1:25:06] read he taught sanctification as the
[1:25:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost Martin Luther
[1:25:13] taught
[1:25:15] justification as the baptism of the Holy
[1:25:17] Ghost and that was
[1:25:20] right for their day
[1:25:25] but the songs they sang were about the
[1:25:31] blood you ever noticed that the people
[1:25:34] of this message are writing new
[1:25:38] songs you ever notice you change uh uh
[1:25:43] from one dispensation to another and
[1:25:46] you'll find songs being written
[1:25:48] about the dispensation you're in sure
[1:25:53] go to Jamaica W can verify go to Jamaica
[1:25:57] and preach a message that
[1:25:59] morning and somebody will write a song
[1:26:03] or have already done it but they'll
[1:26:04] write one if they ain't got it they'll
[1:26:06] write one for the evening sure about
[1:26:10] what you're talking
[1:26:13] about I remember I went over one time
[1:26:16] and I was preaching my heart about and
[1:26:17] they were just shouting all over the
[1:26:19] place and I was preaching on about
[1:26:20] Michael being chry
[1:26:24] when it got through I thought my Lord
[1:26:26] they must have wrote the song while I
[1:26:28] sing cuz I didn't know that was a song
[1:26:30] like that they got up there singing
[1:26:32] Michael on your side you
[1:26:36] know get what I'm
[1:26:41] saying get the point
[1:26:45] listen Abraham needed a
[1:26:48] revelation about a sacrifice yeah
[1:26:53] to be given in the place of his son he
[1:26:57] had to sacrifice he was going to
[1:27:00] sacrifice
[1:27:04] it he fully intended right to kill his
[1:27:09] son
