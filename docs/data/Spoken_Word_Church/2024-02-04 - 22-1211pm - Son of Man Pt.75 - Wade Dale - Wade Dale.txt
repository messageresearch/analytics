WhatsApp brother Russ duner's uh nurse uh that takes care of his um special needs child I had a head on collision this morning and um I don't want to read the whole thing it's really long but uh in essence the husband said thank you for the prayers uh they thought there was three breaks in her pelvis there's only two uh the brain bleeds has pretty much stopped and and stabilized but it was a head-on collision they said it was pretty pretty uh pretty intense so we need to keep them in prayer because um brother Russ has been um showing her the message and and her husband the message and they've pretty much accepted it I say pretty much they're still you know working on some things but but he was real uh really struck by what uh you guys had put on WhatsApp because brother Russ had sent him the link to it and that you had prayed and that things were working toward the good not working toward the bad all right so everybody got that I got to read something too I forgot to bring my phone I'm sorry about that we get connected to these things so much just Master Richard button oh that's from Anderson Master Richard button we've got a Richard button back there somebody MH a Richard button real quick all right here we go this is from Janet she didn't want to come up here and do this so I'm going to do it for her she did a good job this morning all the other ones too amen all

all are willing to participate and be a team player have a huge thank you to everyone that helped with the costumes and props those were pretty neat that I may not have already had and helped get the children dressed Rachel Monica Julie Anna Amy Jeffrey and Boyd if I leave somebody out she did I didn't Boyd he always does Boyd always does almost anything I ask him to do I'm reading I'm reading I'm reading exactly what she sent me and he's always there for me willing to build any prop that I need he is there for late night no sleep nights you know why am I reading that he's there when I'm stressed out and overwhelmed well she loves Boyd so do we so she appreciates him very much so do we I also want to just say a huge thank you to Rachel Canada she is always there for me as as well she's creative she knows what I'm thinking that's scary and willing to put in the extra I'm just reading what you said put him the extra hours it may not even seem like it but even a small production like this Rachel none probably put in 20 plus hours preparing along with Boyd and Joseph Janet's got the same syndrome my wife does it would have took me three sentences to do this and it takes her three pages so yeah when Jim tells the story you have to okay all right okay so the shirt was blue tell me what happened the four of us spent off and on two hours contributing we know they worked a long time right Rachel's always willing to do things with me and even if it's the last minute she helps me she has helped me almost every big event in my life for the past 18 years wow my kids wedding and reception Zach's wedding and other weddings yeah they y'all really did a good job at Zach's wedding everybody did pitching in helping uh other weddings my kids graduation showers she's been there for all kinds of events over the years even work for me when I had my shopping gainful for 10 years I didn't know that she was my right-hand woman she does what I what needs to be done and picks up the slack oh just give her a crown I just I just missed a couple of sentences I just wanted to make sure everyone here knows that I recognize their contribution and always also how much I appreciate their participation and help it takes a t and that's exactly correct even Esther Smallwood playing the piano and Tony coming and sitting patiently while we practice I'm just reading I'm just reading I'm just reading what she wrote and joy filling in at the last minute I figured she was probably a last minute fill in there brother and sister Dale were not just allowing us to do this but encouraging us to do this and I sure appreciate that amen we appreciate Sister Janet so now that the sermon is over we can go home we appreciate everybody's help it's a team effort we're all we're a team we've always done this for years and years and years and years um I don't get nervous when it comes around events like this I know somebody's going to pitch in I know somebody's going to do something so I don't uh I don't see where we've ever been without and I think we've done as much as we can with what we have I I I wish we had a stage three times this size to get everybody in it but we don't and but you know what with this limited space they do a wonderful job in this in this small uh facility all right so remember brother Aaron's preaching Wednesday night uh this coming Sunday brother Bob's going to be in Ohio so pray for him he'll be flying up the weekend Louisa be at brother Jean Williams next weekend and then I think brother Aaron's going to be gone too so I'll be here by myself me and Daddy December the 28th keeps December the yeah December 25th we'll have no church service and then Remember December the 30th and 31st brother Wayne Lawson to be here I want to congratulate um Esther black and Micah Curtis when they come we'll we'll really put bring them up here and pray for them pray with them because they are now engaged all right sister Esther black and brother Micah Curtis they're engaged to be married don't know the time yet but we sure appreciate them we've watched them grow up I was looking at some pictures back there on the archives man little Zach black he's married now he's got facial hair not in that order but but and it's good to have sister Lily with us and she's just a real beautiful part of the part of the group and we appreciate her is Dad here father oh he's in the back in the okay all right okay we appreciate po we need to keep praying for him that that old coffin will get out of the way cuz you know how it is when you cough and then when you cough uncontrollable it's even worse so we want to pray that the Lord will bless him in that so I know we all have needs this is a trying time of the year everybody's got things to do like I said next weekend let's pray for our brothers being out um on the field preaching the gospel and then also remember families getting together people going to be traveling the L the Lord just be with us all satan hate he'd love to make us have a head on collision but we're going to pray for each and every one of us that we're not going to have any issues and we'll continue this year into January and have a wonderful time in the Lord amen so let's go to the Lord in prayer dear Lord thank you Lord for the people here without the brothers and sisters in this church it would be just four walls a ceiling and a floor there would be nothing here but Lord they bring you here in their bodies and their their soul lord they they worship you Lord they worship you in song and and putting these plays together and and and working together and bringing food together and everybody pitching in and doing what they're supposed to do Lord I pray that you would continue that throughout the coming years until you come Lord and take us home and then we won't have to do this anymore we won't have to do we'll go to a banquet supper that's already fixed for us we'll go to a house that's already fixed for us and we'll be there for an eternity be able to eat and drink Lord and enjoy each other's company father I pray that you'd be with the ones that are sick be brother Dale there in the back Lord that you'd raise him up Lord and take that old cough away from him and all the ones Lord sister Fred and different ones that are not here that are sick Lord I pray that you touch their bodies you're still the Healer and Lord as the Bible says as a word Goes Forth that you sent your word and healed the people and deliver them from from destruction so I pray Lord that you be with us the further the service in Jesus name we pray amen the Bible says in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth Luke 6: 19 the whole multitude sought to touch him for there went virtue out of him and he healed them all and here's what I want to get to this afternoon I was um sting yesterday and or day before yesterday and just kind of chilling out and I thought Lord there's got to be you know there's layers to this message there's layers to the Bible it's like someone says an onion peel the layers are there they're the same layers but they're real thin but you to peel them back and it's the same Lim it's the same orange I mean onion so I said Lord there's got to be something that connects this to the seals so we're going to try with the help of the Lord cuz I believe he showed me some things uh day before yesterday to uh to help us put these in the seals cuz we're I want to call us from now we're seal people not seals but seal people we we have come the Seven Seals are open brother Dale I believe has preached the word to us opened up the seals to us the prophet brought us the opening of it and I believe brother Dale even way back in the 80s he brought it like no one before and no one after and I'm uh you can hate me if you want to but listen to those 60-something sermons if you'll listen to those 60-something sermons it'll change your life brother boy you got your hand up me me too it'll make you see the word in a way different than than you just say well it's horses riding off and it's red colors and black colors and no there's something behind that and brother Brown said it was a book of redemption amen all right so let's read Revelation 6 ver1 and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of Thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see now what Beast was that it was the lion l i o n is everybody with me so keep that in the back your head so we can get through into the into the service and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was what Crown something was given to him a crown was given to him and he went forth what conquering and to conquer you may be seing the Lord as his Blessing to the reading of the word but just to get to that I want to read here as we did this morning and the layout to see in church age I know there's some new ones here some that that that have never heard these terminologies before and we uh appreciate new people coming in and we we want to not so much go all the way back but if you've got the Holy Ghost I'll promise you if you'll open your heart up to God he will fill it with the truth he will catch you up he will he will not leave you behind he will bring you to where you need to be if you'll just open yourself up and say God I don't understand what that man's saying could you please either send somebody or tell me what to read tell me what to study and I promise you if you'll make yourself available God will give you the answer to what you need so we know that brother random came for a special reason he came for two reasons number one is as we said before as Jude said he came brother Brown came to take those mystery those truths that were in the first church age second third Church Age and what did he do he brought them what current to take care of all the denominational ideas to take care of all the man's ideas to take care of father son Holy Ghost and tell what the truth of that is amen the truth of marriage and divorce the truth of of all these different things the truth of of water baptism the truth of no eternal hell what bringing the loose ends together so that so that not so that we can not that we can be smarter than somebody else don't ever try to use this message to know something somebody else don't know that's the wrong attitude to have the right attitude is to say Lord it couldn't have been me it could not have been me that's right right I could be like that person over there but you don't want to stand up like those Pharisees did and said oh you know that guy's over there confessing his sins and he's got his hands up and he's crying out to God I never did those things remember what did Jesus say which one went home forgiven not this guy that guy did amen so the best thing for us to do is just get the Slate cleared out know that we're in the right message of the hour know that we've got the truth and that we're listening to the truth not so much as say me but all of the whole thing the whole fivefold Ministry the whole every time you put on a tape every time you watch somebody Maybe on YouTube brother Donnie Reagan different ones listen to them it's like brother Dell's always said he said even in error he's found Truth Listen to that even in error he's found truth because you listen to somebody and it makes you study it makes you dig more it makes you you hear this little something and maybe the Bell goes off something may right about that well you know what it makes you do it makes you go find some quotes it makes you go find some Bible it makes you go pray Lord is this it or is this it all right so it's a constant unfolding of God and that's what I believe the message of the hour is a constant unfolding of God it's not just one drop on top of you and just you know no you couldn't stand that we have to develop as we're talking about now we have to develop from what babies to adults so so and I told you that Lord many couple years ago said you know tell the people don't worry he said I'm going to leave anybody behind that wants to be caught up now if you don't want to be caught up then God God can't help you anyway but there messenger of Malachi 4 in Revelations 10:7 is to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he'll turn the hearts of the children to the fathers what the children the Pentecostal babies that had their Doctrine wrong that had their speaking in tongues wrong that had their gifts wrong that had their idea that if you spoke in tongues you got the Holy Ghost and it didn't matter how you lived afterwards that's Pentecostal babies but he was trying to bring them back to the faith of what of the mature fathers when Peter James and John when they were the gate beautiful when Peter when Paul was writing the most of the um New Testament they were mature Christians they weren't noves they weren't somebody that just come in the message in other words everybody with me okay so number one according to Malachi 4 he'll turn the hearts of the children of the fathers and if you'll if you'll read a few times if you'll look up the word uh years of preparation brother Bown talks about it several times he said it's not in the years of preparation in other words his full message was not just the years of preparation not just bringing these truths back it was what it was then like we were saying there it was to open the seals to show us the full Plan of Redemption not part of redemption the full Plan of Redemption so everybody all right with that we'll just kind of easing along here just for a little bit maybe for a couple weeks so everybody can and listen I catch up all of us we we all have a catching up time we like they've been many times Brother D preach sermons and two or three months later I'm like but I said God there's got to be something in there got to be something in there that that may not been for me that day but give me something for me and then the Lord will put it all together for you if you'll make yourself available now if you just say well I'm just live this I've heard this 25 times well one day you going to hear it for the last time amen so number two so he has a two-part that he's going to do so so brother Brown says not in the years of preparation the healing campaigns you know I I enjoy it but not as much as I used to I enjoy that you know they made a tape one time of all just prayer lines that's okay but that's not for growth that's for Faith got to have faith first but then there's got to be a growth what brother Bram say he said that was just what the bait on the hook right you catch the fish with the hook you just throw bait out there and they're not going to catch a thing but you got to put what hide the hook in the bait and once you throw it out there but what was he hiding these mystery truths is what was hiding in the message of the hour that people were trying to get up to and you know what a lot of times they'd take the bait they wouldn't get the hook they they dwelt on what the minor the prayer lines and all the that's okay to a degree but that's not going to mature you if brother R says every time you come up to the pool pit and get prayed for you get weaker that doesn't mean you get stronger everybody with me all right now well we you know we pray for the sick we pray for anybody wants to be prayed for but there's got to come a time when you may not can get to the people that you need to try to get to and you have to do it for yourself and you know what if you're not used to it you ought to practice some for once in a while practice talking to God for yourself amen okay guy asked me this morning um we sell so much honey do we have to buy U from a guy that lives in mazille and he we met him this morning I did at 15 minutes till 8 we got to talking and I looked down at my watch he said oh do you have to go to mass this morning sure I said no I said we don't believe that I said we believe in going to chur Church hello somebody I mean if somebody can can put that a Catholic you know they go to church every day devout ones go to church they do Mass all the time and where's sister Anna right sisterna I mean they go they go to mass that's that's their thing that's their salvation that's their Holy Ghost is they get that wafer and and get the blessing from the PO from the from the not the pope but from the priest and I thought that's kind of funny well really cuz every time he we pick up from him we I got to go cuz we're going to go to church so he always wants to meet on Sunday so um I said no we're not Catholic I said I should have told him the original Catholic but I didn't have time to explain that either I needed to leave and get to church so I cut it off and I said NOP not Catholic but see you later all right so number two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven Thunders which is the Seven Seals now what is the thunder the Thunder is a voice of God not some mysterious boom boom boom it's the voice of God when the SE SE breaks to you there's something happens you you hear this you hear something you've never heard before amen if if the Seal's ever break to you you will hear something that you've never heard before and that's the Thunder or the voice of God speaking to you so in Revelations 10 brother Brown see if he was just Malachi 4 then we need a 107 to come cuz we need the maturity part we've already down through the church ages from church age 1 to church age s they've got the Holy Ghost they just had a problem with some of the denominational ideas God winked at that ignorance but he in the end time he said no I'm going to send you a prophet according to Malachi 4 and that same Prophet according to Revelations 10 verse 1-7 everybody with me on that so Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals contained in them so the Thunder when the thunder sounds that's the Revelation that's inside the seal it will be these divinely revealed not just halfhazard divinely revealed m hisory truth that what literally turned the hearts of the children to the Pentecost the fathers to me that's the Capstone everybody with me on that the the the seals uh don't get me wrong but you don't need the seals for this because Paul had this and he didn't know what a seal was he never heard about a seal anybody with me Peter James John they all had this right here working in their life but what happened was is The Headstone once he went to heaven there in Acts one he went and took and that the head left and and to be real honest men became heads of the church Satan became the head of the church now this is Anointed ones at the end time he's trying to be the head of the church now so and him being wanting to be the head of the church God sent the headstone back Revelations 10:1 that Mighty angel that came down from heaven that's Christ that's the son of man that's God moving into John come on somebody that's God moving into John I didn't didn't think about doing this but let's just continue for a minute but Revelations 101 was the mighty Angel who'd he come down to he came down to John and John tyed the bride he came down and he was standing on Earth in a man called William Bram not that he was the son of man no way the requirement of the son of man was is he had to be virgin born brother brandham was not virgin born so he was not the son of man he identified himself as a son of man revealing the son of man all right so that's the where the mystery truths come in but but people you know Satan Satan wants to be so close till he'll put it in their mind oh he was God right God didn't say that God didn't tell people brother Ram was God Satan did Satan's a what brother ram calls him one time a Trier uper he's somebody wants to what get your mind off of the real and get you about that far off all right brother brandham was the greatest man that ever walked on the face of this Earth outside of Jesus Christ but he was not Jesus Christ cuz God said and declared I will not share my glory with no one I am a jealous God I won't share my glory cuz I didn't create me I always was I created everything else amen so these divinely reveal what mystery truths are going to turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers true Pentecost not Pentecost 1906 so let's read just a few minutes on Truth John 17:17 says sanctify them through thy truth the only way we're going to come to real true sanctification I don't have my chart I took it off of my notes for a minute but you know that we came to sanctification where the unclean Spirit goes out right everybody with me all right don't get quiet on me all right that unclean Spirit leaves that's coming out of your soul all right all right say now that we got it filled with the Holy Ghost justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost comes in and what SEALs that thing can't get out I mean in God can't get out you're a sealed unit but we got to go as we were talking about this morning you got to go to that second man the spirit man of memory reason conscious affection imagination and you've got to see that in there it's like s sister Shepherd's dream there was a box and when that water what water the word word was poured into that box what happened Sticks came out trash came out brother Brown said after she was born again so that's what we're dealing with now we're not dealing we're not dealing with sometimes truth we're not dealing with sanctifying your soul again okay cuz I believe in once Born Again always Born Again everybody with me I don't believe like I don't believe like the Baptist do once saved always saved and you go out and do the way you wanted to and you did the same as you did before nope don't believe that there is a change in your life because somebody else has moved into the house and the devil's out but you know what he still wants to get back in he can't understand why he can't get back in and make you curse as I was talking about this morning make you do the things you used to do he has no clue you know why cuz he can't get born again he's always been the way he was he was perfect but iniquity was found in his heart sanctify them through thy Tru truth Thy word is true so the sanctification that we're talking about now is is taking these bits of demons virtue knowledge Temperance Pati is driving out those other little guys those little demons that bother us all the time as the cartoon has you know got one on your shoulder one on the other well I got about 16 or 17 18 20 on this side and one on this side but this one listen if you're born again this one wins amen this one wins if you're born again if you're not then you're in trouble anyway sanctify them us through thy truth Thy word is truth and I believe we have the truth so you got to believe as even brother Bob was talking about this morning you cannot believe that scripture he read about forsake the S you can just not believe that but that doesn't make it wrong that doesn't make it that doesn't negate it or do away with it no that means you just what you don't believe in truth right right you don't believe that you're supposed to do what the Bible says do so if you'll get it off on one you'll get off on another one all right listen every day of our life we don't live 100% of the Bible because we're born in sin shap and iniquity we have a carnal mind but having the mind of Christ as supposed to what the Bible says what transform us into His Image that's what this statue of perfect man is transforming it's letting that inside guy work outside let it out one way or the other and thou has sent me into the world even so now I send them into the world so he's sending us out in the world he's not going to put a hedge around us not like job he's not going to put a hedge around us he's going to let Satan do all he can because you know what he told job Satan said you got a hedge around him said if you'll take that hedge down said I'll make him deny you and the Lord said okay the Hedge is down but you can't touch his life I'm the only one that can do that that's why the trials we go through and the tribulations we go through we think where is God he's right there if you're a son and daughter of God and you believe that you are every trial every test is for your good and your benefit and you'll see at the end of it you'll go that's exactly why I should it that happen right let your what the what's this the song say let your trial become a blessing amen right and it's hard listen it's hard it is hard on our flesh and on our spirit realm but that Soul inside of you loves to come to church loves to read the Bible loves to study the message of the hour loves to be good to people but that memories and conscious affection imagination that's attached to that that's keeping that thing like this you know like you know when Lazarus was was taken out of the and giv his life back you know he still had to be loosed right even though he had life even though he had life even though you've got eternal life and Satan is has still got his hands around you but God said Lazarus come forth he called your name and said come forth and your soul then what was what resurrected and walk in the newness of life you still are bound by those grave clothes cuz Jesus even had to say had to say he said hey loose him that's what we're talking about now we're trying to get the loosing part loose us loose those things and let us go he was still bound hand and foot with grave clo so he couldn't do nothing I mean he was totally alive but he was like this but once he got out of that thing man he wasn't sleeping I promise you that amen for their sake I sanctify myself that they all o might be Sanctified through the truth God of this evil age he talks about the Inside Man now I do we all understand there's there's five senses to the outside memories and conscious effects imagination on the inside five C Phil smelling here that's just the contact this world it can they can be fooled every one of them can be fooled memory reason conscious affection imagination that's where God is and that's where Satan plays but if your soul is born again today it is God it is no more God and there no less God but he wants to be more God in your spirit realm he wants to be more then sometimes we even want him to be so I'm not going to read this again because the very B of man is what free moral agency free will we were talking about this morning that inside guy because thy spirit is of a worldly nature as we were speaking of this morning cuz it was not given from God but it was permitted by God all right now you got to understand that you say well where did it come from it did come from from God but it wasn't Eternal it was perfect your soul the Breath of God breathed into your kid when you a baby and you became a living soul but you didn't become a newborn creature in Christ you were still born in sin still saing in iniquity still espouse from your mother's womb a liar doomed and on your way to hell so look so that person inside is a centner to begin with so the five inl inlets is what we memories and conscious that's what we're going to talk about from now on then it talks about your body and as I've always said and some people look at you all crosseyed they say my flesh made me do this no your flesh did not make you do that your flesh never made you do anything that your spirit inside of you didn't want it to do I cannot move my hand without thinking that my hand's going to move everybody with me all right so you're motivated by what your flesh no you're motivated by by the spirit is inside of you all right so there's no faculty or mental faculty even in your brain the Bible says as a man think it in his heart not as a man think it's in his brain now you got to process it through there like this computer you got to process the information through there right but remember the old saying garbage in garbage out good in good out all right garbage in garbage out good in good out this guy is just along for the ride that's right but it's cursed and it's dying it's getting gray-headed I was looking I want brother Joe and some of them to to do this and I know y'all probably don't want it done but I think I'll keep it a secret never mind boy doesn't ain't that good so now from now till the end of the service you're not going to think about nothing but what I'm going to do amen no I was looking I was looking back to 2013 if you ever look back in our on our website we've got the Valentine's banquet coming up up in in uh February go back to 2013 and look at y'all then and look at you now uhhuh okay then we may just display that during the next Valentine's pqu you know the 2013 2014 2015 it just keeps getting worse and worse now to the last man which is the soul there's only one sense I was looking at um Esther just looked over Tony and I I looked at their wedding picture the other day wow next quote some people they were married 29 years and that's wonderful that's a good that's great you know we we look I was talking to somebody the other day about weddings and we just got from Lily and Zach and looks like we may have another one coming up so give us a break somebody else if you don't mind but you look at all the all the time effort and money and and message Believers though we live under a whole different a whole different um um attitude but the world 50% of people within five years are divorced five out of 10 so when they walk up there to the aisle and they're not they're just people of the world anything can take them apart but brother Brown said what God joined together you take two Holy Ghost filled people they'll learn to love each other they'll learn to stay together through thick and thin now it's just nothing like well well you burnt to Macaroni I'm out of here I'll get on whatever that is and tender or whatever and I'll find me another one real quick right right I just got it from you you said it one time to Me Tender Is like something you burn like kindling or something like that you know Bob Bob said it okay Bob Bob did you say Tinder okay so Tinder is a dating app for anybody doesn't know that you swipe left if you like them and right if you don't so it kind of weed but you see that's what the world's that's what the world I saw it online I read it I read it online um but no that's what the world lives under and you spent 25 and $30,000 for weddings now can you imagine 5 years later they're gone from each other what in the world but see I don't Lily and Zach I there's nothing in their mind that I know nothing in our minds it says well about 5 years from now we ain't going to see one of them no no it's real it's for us and that's why you get two Holy Ghost filled people together and they going to figh and fuss Lily's already hit him look at his hand he said he done something with it so at some a bachelor the bachelor party but anyway we W talk about that either but I believe it was more like frying pan yeah frying pan that's all right just don't come in next next week with another one like that you'll learn shut up and stand up it's two different words but you see we we can even our Sweetheart's banquetting we can we can we can negotiate life if you'll just let God in your life if he'll let if you'll let God in your life there sometimes you do think that hey this is it I'm I'm done but then God will bring one preacher or he'll bring one sister call you or one brother will call you say hey I hear you having trouble I want to pray for you man talk about a bombing Gilead talk about something that'll smooth something over talk about what assurity and that faith that we have that two people can come together and we can live together in harmony and we can live together as Mom and Dad has for 60 four years five years amen a lot longer than a lot of us been born that's for sure alive right and and I know and listen when you say this in a congregation and I don't want to make anybody mad or think about old things but we just have life a lot of times we make bad decisions right Donny you know I mean you make bad decisions but you've come to the truth you've come to the truth let's go forward from that don't worry about that what happened in the past let's go forward from that that's why I believe brother brandham gave us a provision when he gave us marriage in divorce he said go on as you are in other words don't go back go forward continue on as you are and don't ever do that again our problem is is a lot of people do that again well see that you took yourself right out from under grace boy I ain't going to preach on marriage and divorce y'all stay right where you at we'll be fine what were we talking about oh having weddings but really think about it if you'll sit down sometime and just write down the pro and cons of being in the message of what we don't have to deal with that the world deals with every day yeah you better consider yourself a blessed group of people I mean a blessed group of people and I know we have anxiety I know we have fear I know we have stress I know we have Strife I know we have Wayward kids and we have problems at work and we have problems here and problems there but listen we know how to handle them if you'll just go by the Bible and that Holy Ghost Inside of You will lead you and guide you into all truth and that means how to handle your boss how to handle the girl in the Drive-Thru that hates your guts and she don't even know you I say a girl some guys too but I just appreciate God giving me an opportunity to at least try to get inside that building called the message of the hour which is tied in completely with the word of God it is the word of God Amen so let's skip this right here we done seen all this remember obeying the truth that's why I love what brother Bob was bringing out this morning we got to obey the truth if you obey the truth then you get the promises and you get the power behind the truth right everybody with me on that you get the power behind the truth but listen God does not have to honor nontruth he actually hates it right we're going to read it maybe if we get down to it ni niik lth in spirit conquering cuz that word yeah we're going to get to if we get down to it where that says to conquer and to conquer it said Nico is the is to conquer brother says conquer the Ley that's what Satan's done he's conquered the leoty and then he's got the preachers too right but it was obeying what God Said to do it's what brought the power what brought the virtue is obedience to the word of God and for those of you Lily and Zach that's marri been married if you'll put God first the center of your life the center of everything you do put God first I'll promise you your life will be a lot easier than the life lived out in the world Amen listen we are not a set aart group of people that we set apart we're a set aart group of people that God set apart the whole world Listen the whole world can have this today the whole world but they don't want it no because Satan is what he's the king of this world he's the God of this evil age he wants this place to be destroyed he wants you to be destroyed you know the quote misery loves company it really does there's some people I've met that if they weren't miserable they'd be miserable how sound but have you ever met somebody like that if God healed them of everything they had they they'd be like whyne why because that's the program that's the program the world gives you a program to always be this and always be that negativism brother says we're not building an organization that's what we got to this morning he's not building an organization look what he sent me to build individuals to the stature of Jesus Christ that they might be the what the PowerHouse and Dwelling Place of the Spirit by his word by his word build up the individual to that place not build an organization listen there's people out there in organization that are absolute super good people that that like Dr Bennett that Mom and him goes to we've all been all of our life almost you go there too boy you know some yeah okay well Dr Bennett is just if he was if he was a believer I'm talking about a message believer with all the with every all the truth he'd be standing right here he's just a good Christian as good as he can stand a Christian but God's not building an organization he's putting all his he's putting all of his his strength on an organization a Baptist to take him across or a methodus to take them across we're not we're depending on God to take us across amen but build the individual to Sons and Daughters of God that's the idea add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge well now you're coming to a place now we're going to talk about virtue just for a minute and then we'll get down to what we were talking about a few minutes ago the whole multitude sought to touch him for there went virtue out of him now that there's not science has proven that that there's something with contact remember brother even in brother Browns when they had limited X-ray and different things that they proved that mayo or whoever it was Pro that if you reach and touch something there's a charge goes between you and that person so it's contact that's why brother Brandon would sometimes he would take the sisters by the shoulder or take them by the hand right and sometimes he wouldn't sometimes he' just point his finger at them so it really is not to the to the fleshly contact he contacted their spirit and when he contacted their Spirit the holy spirit that was there did whatever healed them saved them whatever it was but there had to be God there for that to go out of right like I said before if you're having trouble in your marriage don't go see somebody's been divorc seven times that's like like I told you I think before Hannah Hannah's you know working at the battery plant she's making good money and uh she's trying to get her debt straightened out she's had some had some debt problems I know we she's not the only one but she started we I took her to the bank and we started talking to the banker and she started saying some things and I'm like where'd that come from like you know how to consolidate your loan well just make the minimum payment I said no who told you that her credit score was like 550 I said who' you hear that from somebody's credit score was 550 no I said you need to talk to some somebody's credit scores 800 right that's why you are with the word of God and the things of Life why do we need to go somewhere else when we got the answer here we've got the answer in the word of God we've got a credit score of 800 why you want to listen to somebody else take that as a life lesson my brother but risk I mean that's but that's the mentality of the world they'll migrate to that every time birds of a feather you know all the 550 credit scores get together and say boy is a way to do it what's your score 550 what's your 550 this a way to do it not anyway that's why I say that's why brother Brown said a novice did not write the Bible novices God did not use novices to write the Bible he used mature people to write the Bible why would you go to a novice that's never had any experience with God or never had like like I said about a marriage counselor you go to marriage counselor and he's got all these degrees and then he then you ask him about his wife and he said well number four she's doing okay I head I go out the door amen that's why we enjoy having the truth we enjoy dealing with somebody that's at least tried their life to live their life good we've all had mistakes but still we tried to make sure that the ship stayed up right and we can depend on each other not give totally false information wherever that came from you it's free well if you credit it's not bad it's free you'll get that in a minute and a woman having an issue blood 12 years spent all of her life her earnings upon Physicians neither could be healed of any of them came behind him and touched the border of His Garment immediately her issue of blood stamped and Jesus said who touched me because what happened was he didn't feel the material move cuz his robe was moving the whole time it was moving bumping up against people cuz Peter says well look Peter say of course old Peter jumped up he said why are you talking about Lord everybody's touching you he said Peter in other words you don't understand what I'm telling you right here he says Peter somebody touched me because virtue or strength that he had built up inside of him a part that had left him and had went and what healed that lady with a blood issue and when the woman saw that she was not hid she came trembling and falling down before him she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately she wasn't she wasn't afraid to testify and he said unto her daughter be of good Comfort thy faith has made the hole go in peace now that word Virtue right there means the same thing as the Holy Ghost because it's dunamus it's power Mighty work strength strength power ability inherent power so that in other words brother Bri said though we'll read it here in just a few minutes where brother Bri said you got to have it to give it out and you can't go buy it you got to have it inside of you so you can give it out that's what Jesus had he didn't have to go get it and I love Peter in that in that situation where Peter and and I believe it was Peter and John that was in the gate beautiful they didn't have to go call the State preser they didn't have to go call the other disciples Peter Peter Peter said look on us look right here I want you to focus on this I don't want you to focus don't focus on my ugly face I want you to focus on me focus on what I'm fixing to tell you that I have silver and gold I can't buy you a ticket to the physician but such as I do have I'm fixing to display it amen right and I believe the man in his heart said I want what they want and he got what he wanted now brother B says look here's what we do what's the first thing have faith and be born again we talked about that several several months ago but after we lay the foundation secondly you add to your faith first you have faith then you add virtue to your faith that is the next colum first pour your foundation then to your faith at virtue now right there knocks a lot of us down wow boy that's only the first virtue and brother Brown said that knocks a lot of us down right there knocks a lot of us down yes sir and virt add virtue to your faith that doesn't just mean living a virgin life everybody with me let's wake up it's getting a little hot in here and I know it's hard to stay awake but just try to try to stay awake a little while longer that doesn't just mean living a virgin life you know know like a woman or a man and so forth that look that doesn't have nothing to do with that it didn't matter to that woman that Jesus was a virgin it didn't matter to the man that g beautiful what Peter's background was amen he was focused on what that man he had what he'd either heard or seen though that they had something different than the rest of the they probably that man went to the Pharisees Sadducees he went to the herodians he went to the Physicians he went like the woman 12 years looking for a doctor and that man when he was sitting at that gate he looked up and he said I want what you got I'm going to try you I've tried everything else they know what the woman said she said I've tried everything else but I'm just want to touch His Garment brother B said being a virgin has nothing to do with it I'm going to skip to this a little bit further virtue before you can let it out you got to have it first you haven't got it it won't come out there's nothing for it to come out of what if someone T tried to draw virtue out of us and the check would return insufficient funds see no no none of there none none there to draw from check bounds somebody looking at you as a Christian and tomorrow see you out carrying on like a sinner now there's not lot of virtue in that not much virtue can be drawn from that see virtue must be in us now what what is virtue it's power inherent power from having the holy ghost you have Holy Ghost virtue inside of you you just got to be able to use it all right then when you get true virtue you can add it to your faith that's the next foundation wall now first you must have faith faith alone won't do it all right faith alone will not do it Peter said then add virtue to your faith you must have virtue in order to add it to your faith and then it might be the reason you don't have it is because many churches of today teach you don't have to have it I say something in the message teach you don't have to they don't even worry about the statute of perfect man come on somebody some of you preachers I know some of you that's that's been around that hardly anybody preaches on the statute of perfect man I said hardly there are some but it's not prevalent it's not trying they're just trying to get to people uh anyway in prayer line maybe they teach you you don't have to have it or the days of it is passed they don't have to have it the only thing you have to do is just join Church yeah they has passed virtue anyone knows what the word virtue means see we must have it if virtue went from him to heal the woman that was sick he's expecting the same virtue in his church let me read that one more time if virtue went from him to heal the woman that was sick he's expecting the same virtue in his church cuz he's our example and if he had virtue to give to the people he expects us amen expects us us to have virtue to give to the people and what is virtue virtue is strength and power we're going to get into that in just a minute because remember all those seals we see that power was given there was a power permitted but there is an inherent power of God that caused those seals to open it caused the W horse rider to ride off CU he was comfortable where he was at down through the church ages because of false Doctrine because of false teaching and different things but when brother brandham comes up and he stands there and that seal breaks and he said here stands a lamb with a book in his hand and there goes a white horse rider Satan had to leave Satan had to get away from him but what' he do though he took a power with him he took a virtue with him listen that's your perfect man brother BR says look Peter said ADV virtue now Peter's talking about building the house of God the temple of God fixing to a place fix it to a place and after you have virtue you must have after you have faith he said you must have virtue with it having virtue for the whole world that'll make you silent virtue for the whole world I preached a sermon about 20 years ago on Reverend Mr Lily Lily the pastor took it from the text where Jesus said consider the Lily how they neither toil or spin yet I say to you Solomon and all whose glory is not AR raid like one like this one look at the Lily it comes from way down in the muck every minute of the day it has to be drawing from the earth and what does it do with this virtue that it draws it gives it out listen you can't today sit here and say I have virtue and keep it all to yourself virtue has to be forwarded to someone else that's right that's why Paul had to go see Adas come on somebody that's right to get that dunamus or That Power from anas to Paul CU after ananas prayed for Paul his scales fell off his eyes he receive the holy ghost ghost of Life comes through the body every minute of the day it has to be drawn from the earth and what does it do with this virtue that it draws it gives it out it makes a beautiful sight for the admirer it opens up itself for honey for the bee to come and get his part don't complain it's just got it to give out what if the bee come in there in sufficient funds no honey that little bee would scratch his head and say what kind of Lily is that what kind of Christian is that that don't have no strength to give nothing out to people just a weak weak Christian well if you're a weak Christian that means you've not done you've not paid your tithe come to church read your Bible study that's the only thing we can that's the only standard we can put it up against is the word of God can't put it up on what this one said and that one said but if we put it up on what the word of God says and we decide that's what we're going to listen to come on now don't get quiet don't start snoring either I said then the first thing you know there's somebody loves to smell the odor he ain't selfish a pastor brother Dale different ones they give their life they're not selfish amen selfish people can't be pastors I I me me no you can't be selfish he's got odor before he can give out odor he has to have it before he can give out Beauty he has to have it before he can give out virtue you have to have it so add to your faith virtue amen understand all right look and I put this in here this is what brother Brown said she touched not the physical person of Jesus in other words I'm paraphrasing here but she pulled out what she needed she needed to be healed of a blood issue that was her that was her whole problem in life and so what did she do she touched him spiritually she did physically touch His Garment but that didn't heal her the Garment part these these don't heal us but the what the power or virtue behind it is what does the healing you can take cloth off off of anybody and just hand them out but are they going to do any good no this has power behind it not nothing to do with this though nothing to do with this it's what's inside it's what what it's the approach right now Jesus talk about the Centurion this is where the power to me to me this scenario shows one thing for sure that Centurion was not a Christian he wasn't even a Jew so he didn't go to the synagogue he didn't believe in Moses's Doctrine right that he was just a ranked sinner he was just a a heathen a Roman a dog that the Jews would consider but the Centurion had to have some sense about him that he watched Jesus and every time Jesus walked by things happen walk by and reach and grab somebody and they stand up boom Lazarus come forth boom they see all these people that are blind he may have been around that day when when um blind barus received his sight you don't know he had to be somewhere because he answered and said Lord I'm not worthy that thou should come under my roof but speak the word only speak the word only look and he never said maybe my servant will be healed he said and my servant shall be healed for I am a man of authority having soldiers under me I say to this man go you know what he was was saying he said Lord I know what you do you say to that devil go and it goes come and he cometh to my servant do this and he doeth it when Jesus heard it he said I have not found so great faith know not in Israel and I say unto you that many shall come from the East and West and sit down with Abraham Isaac Jacob and the kingdom of God but the children of the Kingdom shall be cast out and outer Darkness I'll be weeping and ashing of teeth and Jesus said unto the Centurion go thy way as thou Hast believed so be it done unto thee and his servant was healed in the self-same hour the Centurion didn't have any virtue but he knew where to go get it at he knew where to go how many times have you in your life being a Christian have just some random somebody or you say hey buddy can I pray for you or or or somebody come up to you and say something to you and it's kind of like how'd you know that well you're different I've been watching you across the room you're different I've got a problem what is it it's a draw they need virtue and we've got it now listen to this real quick and I'll get to the seal part in just a minute I can imagine them Apostles never acted like us this is a prophet they went around probably men of few words till they got in the pull pit they walked in they done what they were supposed to do and walked out H yes sir they had power they had virtue they had no arguments with men they knew where they stood that's all they know who they believed they kept on walking in the spirit just as I said the other night one little nod that's all God had to do then nothing's going to stop them they didn't question and study and hum hul and worry like we do whether they should do this or not this is like this is brother brandom saying that we do that he's talking about himself just one little nod from God that done it just as soon why how could they know it was a nod from God they had all these virtues in here all these qualification so they knew by what their virtues that God was saying go ahead and the first little nod of God compared with every bit of this and with his word they know it was a word of God and they went didn't have to worry about nothing else when God spoke they went now here's one at the gate beautiful Peter and John went together into the temple at The Hour of Prayer being the ninth hour and a certain man laying from his mother's womb was carried whom they laid daily at the Gate of the temple which was called Beautiful to ask arms of them that entered into the Temple look who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple ask an arms and Peter fastened his eyes upon him with John and said look on us and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of them expecting to receive something of them expecting to receive something when you walk through that door expecting to receive something when you press play expecting to receive something when you open a book and read a book or read the Bible expecting we we should not read this like a newspaper and I know we do sometimes well I got to read my daily devotion you know whatever it is are you expecting to receive something wow then Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have not that I got to go get or go buy or talk to Jesus again come on somebody Jesus had already left and he said what power I got I'm giving to y'all and you use that power the same way I did such as I have give I Thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk and he took him by the hand and and lifting him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength wow what a miracle and he leaped up stood walked and entered into the temple walking leaping and praising God and all the people saw him walking and praising God and they knew it was he that sat in arms so the other people are seen him the whole time they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened to him and as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John all the people ran together unto them in a porch is called Solomon greatly wondering and when Peter saw it look he answered unto the people ye men of Israel why Marvel you at this or why look you so earnestly on us as though by our own power our Holiness we had made this man to walk the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob the god of our fathers has glorified his son Jesus he's preaching them a little sermon that here whom you delivered up and denied him in the presence of pilate when he was determined to let him go but you denied the Holy One and the just and desired a murderer to be granted unto you he rebuked every one of them standing there the whole Temple full of priests probably full Kus was there and Sadducees and a whole bunch he said y'all Bunch what' you do you denied the very one that you're saying that you worship let's look at this real quick and then we'll close and then we'll back up maybe next Sunday preach a little more on this Revelation 6 verse1 so now let's shake yourself for just a minute and let's see if we can put these together and the second one and the third one and all down through here and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of Thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see now which one was it it was lion the lion which was the power the powerful one all right and I saw and behold a white horse and he that said on him had a boat White Horse not a dirty one white horse seemed to be righteous seem to have power and he that sat on him had a bow we know that he didn't have any errors he was a bluff but it kind of looks good the way this is put in the Bible right kind of looks good kind of looks good because brother Brown even was deceived come on somebody he preached a mighty conqueror in 1957 1959 and said that was the Holy Ghost but remember he had to progress once so seals open he knew that white horse rider was the Antichrist not Jesus Christ all right and I beheld a white horse and he that said on him had a bow well if you don't believe if you don't believe me go to the first seal brother R said if I i' have made a horrible mistake if the Lord hadn't to come into the room what he was going to preach that that was a white horse rider was the Holy Ghost what he said I'm just telling you what he said don't don't throw stones at me and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sent on him had a bow look and a crown was given a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer now that word brilliant that white horse brilliant brilliant from whiteness spoken of the garments of angels of those exalted to the Splendor of the Heavenly State shining or white garments worn on festive or state occasions look used of white garments as the sign of innocence and purity of Soul that's how Satan presented himself he presented him in the first church age as that a white righteous church that God was right there he used white uh look white my that means Purity that was the worst mistake that people made by pointing to that and saying that's God cuz it wasn't God none of this whole 612 is not God 62 is not God that's Satan but we give him as Brother Gary Atkins always said we give him the power we draw virtue the world draws virtue off of that daily the whole world Listen the whole world is deceived except for the bride read your Bible revelations of whatever it is 17 or somewhere another he deceived the whole world except those whose names were written in the lamb Book of Life for the foundation World deceive them all Revelations 138 because it correlates with Hebrews 13:8 used to used white garments as a sign of innocence and Purity then that word conquer means niik or nio or nican Spirit look overcome conquer Prevail get the victory to conquer to carry off the victory come off Victorious now of Christ that's Victorious over all his foes of Christians that hold flash their faith even unto death against the power of their foes and Temptation and persecution when one is arraigned or goes to law to win the case maintain one's cause and I wrote myself a note that was all of false power in Revelation 6:2 but the world one more time the world on that scripture draws virtue saying that that's God when it's the devil but on the flip side like I said before when the seal opened it meant that Jesus was revealed first that there is a white righteous church that there is something what conquer and to conquer what what's this statue of perfect man who you conquering I'm Conquering the devil no you're not you're conquering yourself you're conquering yourself and you can be white there was a white righteous Church in the first church age but Satan was right there mirroring the whole thing all the way down through there listen the first church first two or three Church agents they did conquer they conquered Satan by their power that was given to that virtue that was given of the true word of God and then what happened Satan turns around and gets on another horse and he starts deceiving them again right and listen he de Lees them this time with a little bit of knowledge that's the next one coming up the second seal is what he comes in as a red horse right and he rides through a couple of church ages false power the whole time but it was knowledge when they went to nah it was knowledge of man that created these false doctrines right not God God does not ever formulate a false Doctrine but Satan gets on his white horse in the first church age and he deceives them enough to take the power away from the church and for the church to put all their strength and virtue or false power on that what Beast system that's why Nicol leoan conquer the leoty if they conquer the Ley they got everything else so that false power is what come up in the first few Church ages that's why that we had to have a faith that went back to that first church age brought the true word of God the true virtue and brought it into this church age by a prophet that what preached listen there's not a man like I said beside Jesus Christ that had as much virtue as that man did that you could pull from him and he could call 50 people on a prayer line and get to about number 10 and he's staggering he's had so much strength pulled out of him by the congregation and by the people but you know what it had to be there first it had to be there that's why to me he's a Vindicated prophet and if you turn him down that white horse has got you right that false power has got you so The Virtue now watch let's talk about just for a minute let's talk about the church being a woman everybody understand everybody with me I know about half y'all are asleep but I'm going to preach right on somebody listen Ruth 3:1 says look and now my daughter now this is this is Boaz and and Ruth right Ruth being the top of the church or top of you and me CU we need a Redemption and now my daughter fear not I will do to thee all that thou requirest for all the city of my people does know that thou art a virtuous woman how they know that how' they know that by the way she acted Amen in the city not just in the church in the city in her everyday life going into Naomi coming out from Naomi going into Boaz and going to doing the things same way with me and you to me that's the virtue and the strength that God wants is for each one of us like I said before when that first seal opened it opened and it exposed the Antichrist but to me it revealed Jesus Christ and where he was or where he is he's in me and you he was in that first three Church ages there was truth in those Church ages wasn't just completely wiped out no but Satan tried his best to put the light out cuz remember in the fourth Church age he almost got everybody he killed 68 million Christians Born Again Believers because of what what they believe but for all the city of my people to know that thou are a virtuous woman woman Proverbs 12:4 the Bible says a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband bride bridegroom a virtuous Bride is a crown to the bridegroom that's what God's looking for now people he's looking for that in me and you listen he wasn't looking for it in the fourth Church age they could barely just say they were Christians in the fourth Church age and they died they didn't have much of a life right but now you and I look we live flowy bed of ease almost amen we drive cars that cost more than most houses did when we were growing up right Proverbs 12:4 say ver a virtuous woman is what a crown to her husband now remember a crown was given in that first seal a crown was given was it a real crown no it was a false Crown there was a false Crown given so he could look good Satan wants to look good he wants everybody to look good that's why he wants you to paint your face up and he wants you to put you on tight clothes he wants you to do this and have all the glamour of the world but the most beautiful people in the world is the Bride of Jesus Christ don't have to put on don't have to take off some of these people you see out there in the world and they're like I'd hate to see that with all let off of her paint what I'm talking about a virtuous woman is a crown to a husband my question to you is can you do that can you do that can Lord Jesus look at you and say that's my virtuous wife spotless sinless really let me read you a quote here but now she that maketh ashamed is rottenness in his bones righteous and just listen to this and we'll read something in just a second then we'll close The Virtuous person exhibits The Joint Excellence of reason and character a virtuous person not only knows what the good thing to do is he or she is always all also emotionally attached to it think about that run that around in your head a virtuous person not only knows what the good thing to do is he or she is emotionally attached to him Jesus was emotionally attached to Lazarus he was emotionally attached to that Centurion cuz he looked at that Centurion he said I can't find no greater faith in Israel everybody in Israel says I'm a devil the ones that don't say I'm a devil say I'm this and say I'm that but that Centurion just saw him live his life right can the Centurion in your life do the same thing question can the people in the world see that you're different that you've got virtue about you that the world can't touch that's my question to you and then if when you got it do you know what to do with it you're emotionally attached to it in other words I want the virtue of Jesus Christ I don't want that virtue of the white horse rider I don't want to be given a crown right don't worry you'll get a crown but it'll be because the virtue of Jesus Christ not because the virtue of somebody giving you that like the devil let's listen to this quote and then we'll close but I like that you not only know what to do but you're emotionally attached to it that's our problem we're not emotionally attached to the word I'm not talking about crying and I'm talking about emotion I'm talking about not having a gape I mean filo love but agape love for the word of God agape love virtue not the other one listen to this inv visible Union the bride of Christ musicians come on he the bridegroom took away your shame and put it in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water of the word and the blood of life that's what the Bible said your first husband that you were married to the world the anointed bridegroom which for ordained you has washed you by the washing of the Water by the church congregation says no that don't sound right does it you might find that in the Alman night but you're not going to find that in God's Bible by the washing of the Water by the word in the word see by the you are standing completely Justified let's stand as though you never did it at the beginning this is my message to the church this was on actually this was on Thanksgiving Day I believe it was and this was his Thanksgiving message kind of a weird message to the world that he didn't talk about pilgrims and turkeys he talked about your standing completely Justified as though you never did it at the beginning that's virtue folks this is my message to the church now as we go off the air just in a moment just in a minute you are standing if you're standing on God's word and with God's word every amen every jot every tit where you standing question mark I'm trying to tell you pull away from them Shucks and get out here in the wheat where you can get right before the sun I hear the coming of the combine you're standing complete Justified like you never did it in the first place Hallelujah talk about a Thanksgiving I feel real good I'm more thankful for that than anything I know of listen to this you the bride this virtuous woman I'm talking about you are the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though you never sined at the first place can we not draw virtue off of that can we not draw strength that's where our strength should come that God said that about us God said it in the word about a virtuous woman and then he sent us a a prophet to reiterate that and say it's you though you never send it the first place you are perfect by the blood of Jesus Christ amen You Are by virtue of God not the devil because there's two Powers working we know that and this power over here and this power over here there's not a lot of difference in it as far as what we see because it's deceiving 99% of the world it's deceiving them they're deceived I'm sorry the Bible says they're deceived they're deceived and only 1% of maybe 1% in this whole world believes that they are the Bride of Jesus Christ and the Bible will back it up right the Bible's got to back up what I said the Bible had to back up what brother Brown said it wasn't it brother R said it and I believe it and that's it well you know he can his son can say that or whoever can say that but uhuh I believe that we live by every word of God Amen and if brother Brown speaks the word of God that's God talking to us and I believe that but when you say that that means you ain't got to study it's just I he said it and I believe it you got it study the Bible says to show yourself approved a Workman needeth not be ashamed what rightly dividing what you hear on those books and tape rightly dividing what you hear from this pull pit rightly divid dividing not wrongly dividing rightly dividing the word of Truth amen because you know what there's one one quote I'm bringing where brother Brown said let's stand up today and address the third person of the Trinity well he never believed in no third person of the Trinity right people misunderstood him I mean you know we talk about other stuff you know brother Brown preached 1977 was going to end the world he didn't say that though they said he said that but he preached It Anyway why'd he preach it confus people we're still here aren't we it proved one thing for sure that there was some people in this world that knew what he was talking about and didn't turn their books in in 1977 like brother Dale different ones that didn't quit the message because they thought that's what he said and why did he preach that why did he preach marriage and divorce you to confuse a lot of people listen brother Brown say God God would have one brother say something to another brother to see how they'll react God not the devil God will have one brother say something about another one to see how they react God knowing from the foundation of the world how you'd react to begin with but you didn't know how you'd react and if you know how to react and build on it thank God that's virtue that's strength that's power that we need not the power that's out there in the world not the power that comes from from Satan that's permitted power you and I don't have a permitted power God's not a permitted power he permits power but he's not a permitted power he is power and if you and I connect to that that makes us what The Virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ I'm telling you what the Bible said about us and then we need to draw strength off of that draw virtue off of that well I ain't nothing I ain't nothing you ain't nothing that may be true but one day you going have to stand on your own two feet and you G have to face the devil oh no not me I I'll let you do that no you ain't going to let me do that brother Brown said he's building individuals you're an individual he's building individuals to what stand when the time comes to stand he's building you he's built us now for 60 years or 50 years since the prophet's been gone Plus in this church trying to get us to see that we're what we can stand what a victory it is that you can stand on your own two feet Amen in this world where they don't care what you do they don't care where you go as long as you just go as the flow I guess you might say or go as the normal that's why we're not normal I want the world to know like Martin Luther Martin Luther the world hates you pretty much is what he said and what' Martin Luther say he said I want the whole world to know I don't like them either that's that's the way I want to look I want the devil to know I don't like him you don't so you just sit there quiet he's beat us too much he's beat on us and beat on us and beat on us it's time for us to look and say hey buddy your power is permitted mine is eternal yours is going to end one day mine's not you say well what if he jumps on me it'll be for your good God will not allow that unless he knows you're going to take it amen so let's start what let's start exerting some virtue let's start letting it out be the virtue of sinless Bride of Jesus Christ let's sing a song greater than all my sin greater than
