hope you had a good little holiday break and good little time with your family and and all of those things I'm going to just speak to you a little uh I guess uh a little Christmas message after Christmas and uh just take a little topic from Luke Chapter 2 so if you want to turn there Luke chap 2: 1 to 20 and uh just just take a topic the message of an Angel to Shepherds and um of course um remember brother Lis is down there at airport trying to pick up brother Eric I we just saw the message that he's um brother Eric got held over in Miami and he's missed his flight and he's trying to make his way over to Atlanta so remember them um remember that situation and of course brother Wade's up in Illinois and just pray that he'll be blessed blessed and um and I think brother Ryan already mentioned just reminder to everybody bring your snacks and desserts and things for Saturday night and and on watch night so um those are the things to remember let's bow our heads and and go to the Lord in prayer Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather together tonight Lord while all these all the our precious Believers Lord Jesus that are gathered together with their all their little looks of fire gathering together here in one place according to your word and Lord we're just maybe just almost on the cusp of another year Lord and I pray God that as we prepare Lord to step over into the other year into this next year Lord that Lord you'll just set our hearts right Lord Jesus Lord I I want this coming year Lord to be more consecrated and more dedicated to you than ever Lord to just lay myself down on the altar of sacrifice Lord just give everything I can to you Lord God and I pray Lord I S A believer's Heart here tonight Lord Jesus to give give themselves more to you to be more consecrated to you to more be more dedicated to you Lord and I pray Lord that you'll just Lord just change us a little bit more Lord that we'll be just lay lay under the Fountain of your word a little bit more next year Lord and you'll just make it mean so much more to us Lord we ask this blessing now in your word now Luke chap 2 verse1 says it's kind of a long reading we'll read the first 20 verses and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed and this taxing was first made when cenius was governor of Syria and all went to be taxed everyone into his own City and Joseph also went up From Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea into the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of David and if you want to go listen to another good sermon that why little Bethlehem would be a good sermon to listen to to find out why I had to be Bethlehem to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife being great with child and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a Manger because there was no room for them in the end and they were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone round about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall shall be to all people uh aren't you glad for that promise tonight anybody can have access for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you ye shall find the baby wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the Heavenly hosts praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace Good Will toward men and it came to pass as the Angels were gone away from them into heaven the Shepherds said one to another let us now go even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the Lord hath made known unto us and they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph and the Babe lying in a manger and when they had seen it they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were Wonder them by which were told them by the Shepherds but Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart and the Shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen as it was told unto them you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now what a what an interesting story that is that um thank God that it was laid out for us in such detail that we can read all these things about how that the um that God was well think about that that the god that created the world that created that spoke to Moses and manifested in the pillar of five and and uh led the children of Israel out of out of Egypt out of bondage and all those things all the all all of that was bundled up in a little baby there laying in the major all of the things that that unknowable God that they could just kind of probe at that here and there they' get a little glimpse of that Joshua would see a man with a sword drawn in his hand and Moses would get a glimpse of uh uh uh the the backside of a man as he passed by but now he was all bundled up packaged up in that little baby that essence of of of the fullness of God there in that little baby in behind behind skin where you could go and you could hold him and he'd cry and you could touch him and the the fullness of God dwell in that little baby and there out in the field there was there was a bunch of little little Shepherds youd say a bunch of nobodies and isn't it strange that God would bypass all of the you know all the great all the Pharisees and the ones that had been trained up to know uh to be able to recognize that that that the pah was coming to be looking for him and God would bypass all of that and go straight to just a little a little Umble little Shepherd a little group of shepherds out there in the field with um we us say getting dirty uh all the Shepherds with all the all the the sheep with all the dirt and maybe maybe there was a sheep that had to be maybe had a baby that had to be a little lamb had to be delivered that night and they maybe got a little bit messy and things cuz that's how shepherds are shepherds are lowly Shepherds is just the meekest and isn't it strange now brother Brown's typing Shepherds Shepherds with with ministers here and isn't it strange sometimes how the world will hate a shepherd and is't it strange sometimes how how people just they they don't like Shepherds so much I it makes me wonder sometimes what is going on how that just in your natural ability your just human your Humanity you just something greats on people sometimes where I just don't like that well well you know what that's what the Pharisees the the world system they might have looked down at the Shepherds too and been like why why look at those Shepherds they're so dirty and so nasty and nobody would ever pay any any mind to them but God did and God came down and and an Angel that's why I'm titling it the message of an Angel to Shepherds those Shepherds were preaching what the angel told them now isn't that the same thing that's happening in this day the the Shepherds have got a vision that an angel come and told them straight from Heaven an angel a messenger an angel that's what a messenger is a messenger is an angel or an angel is a messenger and they they got uh they got wind they got told by that angel where that they could find God wrapped up and veiled up and bundled up in flesh where they could actually go and see him and look at him and and all they wanted to do they once they heard that once they heard the angel singing and the Angel's message oh they were just consumed with a great desire I got to go see this for myself and they ran and Went to went to Bethlehem and and they searched and found out where that that little baby was and they found it and they saw him and they saw they saw that the thing that had been prophesied all down Through the Ages that now it was laying there and they could see it with their own eyes Now isn't that how the gospel is when you can see it for your own eyes maybe one day you heard about it from a little Street Corner a little little Mission somewhere maybe you heard about it from somebody some little humble Shepherd that the world wouldn't even give nothing to and you heard it preach for yourself and you said I I got to go find out whether this is really true or not something grabbed a hold of your heart and pulled you drew you to himself and you had to go see whether this thing was really true or not and when you saw that it was true you had to go tell somebody else now that's what these Shepherds did they had to go find they had to go into the City and tell everybody I know where the Messiah is oh wasn't that isn't that your confession tonight when you first heard about the message of the hour when you first heard that these things were true that God could actually heal that God could do these things that signs and wonders were being done that the blinded eyes were open that the Mysteries that have been sealed up for ages now were be were revealed and accessible to us and all that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the Shepherds a bunch of lowly a little group of lowly nobody nobody that that an angel from heaven came and told them where that they could find that little baby laying in a manger and brother B will say why was this great event revealed to Shepherds why was it revealed to Shepherds and not to the theologians of that day they were the one who trained to hear it and why did it come and bypass the rich and come to the poor why did it bypass the learned and wise and come to the humble and unlearned to unlearned untrained uncultured the poorest of all look like the most unfit person for such a task Now isn't that what God does is he'll it's so strange that he'll bypass people that been trained their whole life train their whole life to study study out the Bible and study out all these things but he'll bypass all of that and reveal it to you a little nobody you'll reveal it to somebody that don't know nothing about nothing all they know is the world all you maybe knew about was how to drink a good Coors or drink a Bud Light or something that's all you knew all you knew how to do was smoke a vape or smoke a cigarette or something or go to some beer beer Pub you didn't know nothing about nothing maybe you grew up in the message but you still didn't know nothing about nothing you grew up in a in a message church or grew up around message people but you didn't want it you didn't want it until God called you and pulled of your heart and something began to move and stir and and it wasn't a man that did it it was God begin to draw you just like those Shepherds heard straight from a from Heaven those Shepherds heard from God themselves why was it revealed to Shepherds and not to the theologians of that day they were the one were trained to hear it and brother br will say isn't it strange that it's the lonely The Humble the poor that will receive it before the heady and high-m minded isn't that strange that God wants a little sheep to hear it that God wants to grab get get a somebody that just ain't nothing he said a humble heart God loves if you don't know your ABCs that don't make any difference just a humble heart God dwells in a humble heart not in education it's not in schools not in theology seminaries not in all these other different places not in big words or Not In classical places God dwells in hum in human hearts and the lower you can break yourself down the more simple you can become greater in the sight of God now that seems that seems contrary to the way that we think sometimes we think maybe maybe the devil's got you convinced that you got to be a real smart real good intellect somebody that knows all that's got a PhD and the and the things of this world to be able to understand this message but all God needs is just a humble heart somebody that'll just open themselves up to this word somebody that will turn off the TV and turn off Facebook and turn off the social media and just get and lay in the word and let God have his way with you that's all God needs God is just looking for somebody that he can get a hold of that somebody just humble themselves to the word and you know what real humility is I think we get tripped up with what real humility is sometimes humility is just knowing knowing your strengths and knowing your weaknesses and not being overly lifted up and not being not oh see so many times we get lifted up with let this false humility well I I don't know if I'm a really good singer or not oh come on now I don't know I don't know see God don't want none of that false humility I don't know if I'm really called to preach oh if you're called to preach he wants you to be confident in it lack of confidence is not humility God wants you to know if if you're called to if you're called to sing if God has put you with a gift where you can bring the presence of the Lord because you can sing and you got a real gift then you might as well own it and say that's what I'm put here on Earth for if you're called to preach you might as well be confident in it and know that God God put you on this Earth to be a bless blingg to other people and God give you a gift to be able to speak his word you might as well be confident in God don't want somebody that'll draw back and some that sissified he wants somebody to be bold and preach it if it's got to be preached and sing it so somebody can receive a blessing that's false humility when you say well I I don't know I don't know I don't God wants somebody to sure if they're born again or not not just go around and say well I don't know if I don't know I might be he wants you to know to know whether you're a adopted or not to know whether you're born again to know whether you got it cuz you're going to have to know whether you got it if you're going to take a body change God ain't going to have a bride that don't know whether she's this or whether she's that that's going to step over into eternity he's not going to have somebody with some false humility but he's going to have somebody confident in what they are and who they are and what kind of a word they've heard and what it's done in their life Matthew Chapter 5 he said Jesus said blessed are the PO poor in spirit the poor in spirit that's real humility to be able to receive something like a real little sheep to be able to sit down and listen to what somebody else has got to say blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted blessed are the meek this this are the things these are the attributes of the kind of person that God can do something with blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for for they shall be filled and I got news for you my brothers and sisters tonight I'm still hungering and thirsting for righteousness after all these years I want to keep getting filled that's my that's my prayer and my desire as we step over into the other year I still want more of God I want more I want all I can get I want more and more the more I can get I believe the more that God will fill us up with it blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven and blessed are ye and Men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake now this this is the cream of the crop somebody that's poor and meek and ain't got nothing but all they they need they they know that they if they can just get a hold of God that's all they want that's the kind of person that God can do something with so this afternoon I I just want to encourage you that if you're poor and you're unlearned and the devil's got you all beat down and your body's all beaten up by life and you're weary and you're mourning have I got good news for you that this is the type you're the type that this gospel was sent for that's the kind of person that God can do something with there somebody that's poor and meek and lonely that like a little sheep God give tell me where the green grass is and I'll eat it up Lead Me lead me to the water and I'll drink it up tell me where I can get it and I'll go get it aren't you glad that the true gospel me it wasn't wasn't meant to just make you feel stupid or to put you down or make you feel feel bad for just taking God at his word but it was said to an humble open heart that is what God is looking for somebody that just receive him like sheep like a sheep just a little sheep you can like like Monica tell us when they were growing up they' they'd kill little lambs to eat you know and the little sheep they wouldn't cry out cuz it's it's not their nature to cry out it's not their nature to complain it's just their nature to just eat and keep pushing out that wool it's not their nature to be anything else but gentle just a gentle sociable sociable creature and that's why sheep get they got to you got to come together bringing your little elix of fire together sheep got to be you got to be with other sheep oh I so terrible to see what the devil will do will just isolate people and get that little sheep off to the self and here comes a wolf to go put something weird in their mind put some s thought in their mind as soon as that little sheep goes off to itself it it it starts thinking well everybody hates me and I can't trust in those Shepherds and nobody nobody really lives the right way and nobody really does this and that oh you got to get together sheep are meant to be together you start getting together and things begin to change you're meant to be together you're dependent you're depend sheep are dependent they got to have that Shepherd that's why when you see that Shepherd that sheep begin to go away from the flock a real true Shepherd will go running after that sheep and say come on back come on back to church don't don't you miss fellowshipping with the other believers don't you miss being around with other saints of God don't you miss CU a sheep a sheep's got to follow leadership a sheep's got to be led and and what's the point of this message that brother Brandon was laying out there and why it had to be Shepherds as we're being led by the Holy Ghost amen we're being led by the Holy Ghost ghost now what a strange isn't that strange that God will put men to lead a a group of people but it's actually not men if they really will yield themselves and and yield themselves so that God can speak a word to them of encouragement and something that'll help it won't it won't put complexes on people if it's really God it won't put you into a place into B where it's binding you up but it'll actually liberate you if it's really the Holy Ghost speaking through through the men but it what a strange thing that it's he puts men but it's not men men preaching a word but it's not men sheep what else are sheep going to be vulnerable they won't be competitive they won't be competing with everybody why cuz they're just trusting in the shepherd trusting in the shepherd to lead him where that grass is they're not going to be pushing one another out of the way this spot of grass is mine there's plenty there's plenty for all they don't have to I don't have to compete compete with the next person over who got the nicest car or who's got the nicest this but we're just trusting in Our Shepherd now I think that's real what real faith is real faith is when you trust in your Shepherd not the man that's standing behind the pulpit but we're trusting in God trusting in God to lead us from pasture to pasture lead us from grassy spot to grassy spot lead us cuz we've got a promise that the spirit of truth will lead and guide us into all truth so we're not following a man we're following the Holy Ghost that's moving through men that's that's preaching to us a word that came not from man but Straight from Heaven straight from an angel's message an angel that come to us to deliver us a message straight from the Throne of God that will change our hearts and change our lives and change our thinking to be just like him why did the Angels go to Shepherds to bring the message brother B said if the Messiah was born in the shadow of the cathedral why do they have to go Plum back up into the mountains to a bunch of unlearned untrained Shepherds to bring the great message the first message and commission Shepherds not the wise and trained but Shepherds it's a strange thing isn't it look like the most unfit people for such a task to reveal the message and send them out to bring the message he would be more able to get his message to a unlearned group so that that than he would be to a mixed up group that was so set in their ways that nothing could turn them not even the word of God now that's why it's got to be Shepherds shepherds are like sheep Shepherds brother Brown will say Shepherds smell you got to smell a real true Shepherd is going to smell like sheep CU he gets in amongst the sheep and really really if you this is kind of a hard thing to imagine in your head but a Shepherd is really a sheep too a sheep they're all sheep and a sheep God God as Ates certain men to to kind of to be leaders of the others and the reason that he can get a hold of these men and anybody that fits under that that uh the umbrella of being a sheep is because they're willing to learn willing to learn he would be more able to get his message to unlearned group than he would be to a mixed up group that was so set in their ways oh Lord I don't ever want to be set so set in my ways that I can't I can't be moved by the Holy Spirit moving in the congregation the Holy Spirit moving people get so hard-hearted and so set well I I know this is right and nobody's going to tell me different I know the way that I see it is right and you're not going to tell me nothing else that's the kind of person that God can't do nothing with always be will that's true humility always be willing to just sit and listen to what the other person says cuz even when somebody's wrong sometimes you can get just a little glimmer of some truth or maybe they can reflect back to you an aspect of yourself that you haven't seen before always be willing to be humble and listen to what somebody else says the Messiah was here and there must be somebody to recognize it and brother rown will say the shepherd was the most illiterate of anybody he didn't need to know nothing but just about his sheep he didn't need to know mathematics he didn't need to know how to split an Adam he didn't need no scholarship he just had to know his sheep that's all he needed to know oh no get tangled up here again all right he just had to know his sheep Shepherd that's all he had to know is just his sheep he didn't know need to know how smart anybody was or all the things of science all he needed to know was about his sheep now what would a Shepherd need to know about sheep well first of all he need to know how to call sheep cuz the Sheep now a real true gospel sheep isn't this interesting now a real true gospel sheep is going to be able to recognize the voice of a Shepherd a sheep my sheep know my voice is what Jesus said so they're going to be able to know the rec recognize when God is calling them now that's how you call sheep as you preach the real true unadulterated word of God and the Sheep are going to respond a Shepherd's going to know what's going to help the Sheep they're going to be able to know well if I if I take them to this green grass over there then that's going to be a help to them but if I just lead them leave them alone then they're going to get here comes a wolf a sheep Shepherd is going to know what's best and what sheep eat and where the Sheep need to be led and what's the enemy of the sheep and the best way to protect them and how are sheep born CU a sheep Shepherd is going to know that sheep are born by the word of God and brother Brown would saying God the great wisdom and the fountain and resource of all wisdom would choose such a person as that he say persons persons rather as that and bypassed all the well- trained Scholars that's trained to know that the highest Heavens hastened to honor Earth's most humble and unlearned the highest of Heaven came down to make himself known to the lowest of the earth bypassing all between to make himself known to Common herdsmen coming to give these common herdmen the greatest message of all all times now what's the greatest message of all times I I believe tonight that we've heard a message Straight from Heaven straight from an Ang the angel of our age has come to give us a message and what's the message to know where Christ is to reveal Christ to you and what an honor I I believe this afternoon it is to know where Christ is what an honor to be able to carry this message carry whether whether you're sitting in the Pew or standing up behind the pulpit you're carrying the message you're carrying it in your heart to be able to know beyond the shadow of a doubt where Christ is today that God made himself as lonely as those he would receive he come down in that in that little manger as to associate with himself with those little Shepherds the lowliest of the earth just just covered in the in the in the things of the of the outdoors and all of those things and so many were bypassed because they couldn't receive it but God came to your doorstep oh we got so many things to be thankful for as we as we close out this year that God that God would come to your doorstep and bring the greatest message to ever be brought to know in this day when after after seven Church ages when people probed and wondered at this and wondered at that but in this day you can know where God is where God is in Matthew chapter 24 he says behold I told you before wherefore they shall say behold he is in the desert oh he's over there in the desert go not forth' behold he is in the secret Chambers believe it not for as the lightning cometh out of the East and shineth even under the West so shall also the coming of the son of man be for wheresoever the carcass is there will the Eagles be gathered together so where is God where is he at he's where the word is and you've heard the word and you've eaten the word and as you hear the word you become the word thank God that we can know by oh Jesus is telling us when they tell you he's a well he's over here come on now listen he's over he's over in Jeffersonville he's up he's up well I know he's in a specific geographic location he's at this specific spot don't believe it because you know where Jesus is you know where Christ is and what a blessing to know where he is I'm talking about by Revelation now you know real Revelation real a real revelation will give you overcoming power and I'm not talking tonight about just kind of an intellectual understanding where we have enough that we can we can kind of go to battle with somebody on a YouTube channel or something or we can go to battle with people on Facebook and we can tell everybody else how much we know and how much how much we've understand but real revelation will give you power over the de I'm talking about power to live a life power to know to know we overcoming power is to be able to recognize the devil in his tricks when he comes to you and tells you something that's contrary to what you know what you know and that's that's why you must know you must have confidence because when the Devil comes to tell you some lie that's contrary to what you know then you can recognize that that's a trap of the devil and say get get the behind me Satan like Jesus told Peter when because he told Jesus something contrary to what he knew that he had to go to the cross and die and Peter said something contrary to that anything contrary to the word of God is the Antichrist anything contr to the word of God and that's why you must know you must have a personal revelation not just head knowledge not just head knowledge that's been packed up but a real packed into your head and packed into your understanding but a real revelation of who Jesus Christ is and that's when you know you know where that that where the where the where God is revealed in flesh brother R will say here he comes with the greatest of all the messages and what was the message what was the message brother R will say Messiah is here now oh you think about a message that everybody out in the world they don't realize that they're put it off they put it off way in the future one day Jesus is going to come back one day he's coming back but to think that he's here now right here on the Wednesday night service right here as as you know the eyes begin to droop and people were wondering if how long is brother Bob going to go and thinking about maybe the thing that you're going to eat when you get home and maybe maybe you might be in that stage of your spiritual journey where you really wishing wishing that you could be watching some some movie or something instead of being at church but even despite all that God is here now and you can know where he is see to brother BR said to make that known to make that known where Messiah is where God is he bypassed all the train to make it known to humble Shepherds somebody that could receive a message what a strange message go to Bethlehem and you'll find a baby in a Manger what you'd think that that would be in this big Cathedral over here you'd think that I'd have to go to the to the high priest down in Jerusalem you'd think I'd have to go anybody but a little manger in Bethlehem but it bypassed all the Nobles and was revealed to the nobodies aren't you glad tonight aren't you glad to be a nobody notice brother rown said where the message was and the most unlikely place that anyone would expect it to come and I wonder tonight if we were looking for the true message of the Lord Jesus I wonder if it would be an unlikely group I wonder if that wouldn't be where we'd find him the most unlikely place and to the most unlikely speakers the most unlikely place a little off the road little place in the middle of a small town in Lula where we don't have smoke machines and glass pulpits and coffee shops down in in the bottom of the building where people can come and and and talk and and and network with all of their friends and people and get a good get past business cards out and network with other people and and it's not not in some Lodge not in some big building and to the most qualified speakers that people that weren't trained up in seminaries people that don't know that don't know how to speak that they just they were working their own job and doing their their normal thing trying to have a family and then God C grabbed a hold of their life and said I want you to speak for me I want you to share the gospel to other people and that's the kind of people that God can use that God can grab a hold of somebody's life your life and my life and and begin to change them by the word and use them for his purpose so the things maybe that they thought that they were going to do when they were young and the things that they thought that would make them happy God molded them by the word and changed them so all that they left behind and and all that they laid down and they didn't want it no more and they just gave everything to God that's the kind of people that God can use somebody that he can somebody that will lble themselves to the word and just let God make him a prisoner of his and say no matter what I do with you like Paul if you got to go to Rome and have your head chopped off or like Bartholomew and be skinned alive or like Andrew that was crucified in an ex I'm going to do with you what I want to do with you and they would say God thy will be done Shepherds that know nothing about speaking only calling sheep oh you think about those early disciples that they didn't know nothing about nothing Peter couldn't even write his own name but they knew how to call sheep Peter sitting there in that fishing boat and Jesus said follow me and I'll make you a fisherman and that man that didn't know anything more than just had a pull on that rope he got out of that boat and he followed Jesus and God began to mold his life so that he could do something with him the great Shepherd was calling we're not following men but we're following the great Shepherd the one that's drawing us the one that's pulling all of us God is the one that's calling John chapter 10 he said Jesus he said Jesus speaking he said Jesus answered them I told you and you believe not The Works that I do in my father's name they bear witness of me but ye believe not because you are not of my sheep as I said unto you my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me oh thank God that sheep can recognize when it's God calling them sheep can recognize sheep can recognize good grass sheep can recognize when it's the Deep calling they know their Shepherd they know they know when it's that thing that they've been looking for their whole life and they hear it calling out to them and they respond cuz sheep know their Shepherd the shepherd's call what is the shepherd's call he's here oh think about all those people in brother Ram's campaign they come there and they they see the prayer line start and they begin to recognize that God is here that this is different than just a normal little church service and when you hear the real preaching of the Gospel preached across the pool and something begins to Echo in your heart and something begins to draw you and pull you you recognize that it ain't just some man talking to you that it's God drawing you and you begin to respond it's a deep calling to the Deep it's a deep pulling you it's something more it's something more than just something natural it's something Supernatural happening Brother would say the infinite wisdom of almighty God did it to make known to them the greatest message ever was that the Messiah is now on Earth Earth he is here he is here is the confession of every believer that's what John said in 1 John chapter 4 hereby know ye the spirit of God every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God now think about that that's the confession of every believer that Jesus Christ is come In the Flesh that's the confession a present tense confession that Jesus Christ has come and to know where he is to know that he's in your flesh to know that he's been born in the manger of your heart oh what a blessing that is at this time of year to know now I'm preaching as though you know but if you don't know let's don't go into another year not knowing if you don't don't know that Christ is born in your heart if you don't know that it's time it's time to get serious oh this weekend we're going to be we're going to going to be gathering here for the watch Night Service to all to gather together to step over into another year but let's don't step over into another year without getting real serious before God no matter where you are at your stage of your journey let's just just set it in your mind yes that I want God I want more of God and I'm not going to rest until I get him and I'm not going to rest until I see the promises the promises that are laying here in the Bible that are manifest in my life because if you look if you look for him if you come looking for him and expecting him to come on the scene then you watch and see if God doesn't manifest himself to you man is always praising God brother R said religious man for what he done and always pointing people to what he he's doing and then ignoring to what he's going to do and then ignoring what he's doing but can you see what God is doing now I I wonder if we could ask that question can you see what God is doing now like when we come to a church on Wednesday night I I I don't ever want to get to where it just becomes boring to me if we get bored by the by the word if you're if you get bored by the word let's set it in our mind that next year I want like pray like David did restore unto me the joy of by salvation if if you maybe you didn't lose your salvation if you really are got your salvation you ain't going to lose it but maybe you lost the joy of it and you just kind of begin to you you spent too much time on social media and you've spent too much time watching movies and things that you you know you shouldn't be giving all your time to that and you just you maybe you hadn't felt the presence of the Lord for a while because you just forsaken you've forsaken your prayer life and you just got away you it's been a long time since you read the Bible as as we step over into the new year let's let's lay all that stuff to the side let's lay all that to the side and just get real serious about being a real Christian I I I was reading a sermon the other day about just how brother R was saying that you like a woman is only got 20 years to have children and he was saying that how he was making the point that we we've only got so many so many years in our life that we can really make an impact to the family that we have to other people only so many years of life before you know your mind begins to deteriorate your body begins to give out and then you go down if if things go on you'll go down into the grave so let's maximize the time redeem the time give everything that we can to God I I was reading where brother Brown said he said I I've I've won a million souls to God but why not two million is what he said why not two million there he was laying there when he when he went beyond the curtain of time laying there and he was thinking before he passed up before he had that that uh experience thinking about how much he more he could have done for God and you think about a man like that that would have that kind of a confession think about I wish i' had done so much more for God when he had given everything in his life and just where where people were wondering brother randam how can you stand he he'd stand up behind the poop and say I faint I almost fainted 10 times while I was answering these questions and he all he gave everything and yet we can barely give anything we can barely give any time to read or pray or study we hardly know what the message is about because we can't get into the message and find out for ourselves but oh let's don't go into another year like that but let's really give everything that we've got cuz God wants a nobody a nothing that he can do something with somebody that he can get a hold of he wants somebody like Gideon that thought they couldn't do it somebody like Ruth that had a b bad background somebody like Elijah that just come out of nowhere somebody like like John that come out of the wild wilderness cuz God takes the nothings he takes the nothings to do the something with and as long as we think we're something then we can't be used in the hand of God we must forsake all we ever knew or learned to go after Jesus look to the word if all else is contrary that's what the Magi were doing they were looking they knew some one of these days A promise is coming but we're not looking for one of these days anymore are we oh that's what the message is that Christ is here brother Brown would say When God says he'll do a thing he did it regardless of what anybody else thinks about it what anybody says when he said behold a virgin shall conceive that might have been hard to imagine that a little virgin was going to conceive and bear a child but it came to pass when he said For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given that seemed hard to imagine that one day that would be fulfilled but then God brought it to pass and when God told Daniel when in Daniel chapter N9 know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the Commandment to restore and build Jerusalem shall be seven weeks and three score and two weeks it would be hard to imagine that one of these days one day that would be fulfilled and the Messiah would be standing there think about all those things that were laying there for the Pharisees and the Jews to read that God actually gave them the timeline when the Messiah would be standing there still they couldn't see him and he's given so many people in the world a timeline of what exactly what to look for and yet they couldn't see it but yet the Messiah the the Magi the Magi were looking never stop expecting for God to fulfill his word don't ever stop expecting to see God fulfill his word oh we come to church day after or week after week Sunday Wednesday after year and and it and it might oh it might kind of get boring to you it might kind of get wearisome to you but don't ever now I'm I'm don't draw back on me now please don't draw back I'm telling you something real tonight don't ever stop expecting for God to fulfill his word or if you need some I was reading one one place where brother R said when we have a need in our life it seems like the first place we go is to the doctor the first place we go is to somebody else but if you when you got a real need when something happens maybe you break your arm or something go goes wrong in your body run to Jesus because why cuz never stop expecting to see a miracle never stop expecting to see God do something and that's what the mag I were doing night after night they look up in the sky look up this up in the sky continuously basing their faith on what they had heard Daniel say when Daniel was down in the Middle East years and years and years before that but yet they kept looking cuz they knew that the Messiah was coming why cuz it said in Daniel 9:24 it actually laid it out the timeline said the Messiah the prince shall be seven weeks and three score and two weeks and after that time period after that he's coming so the Magi were looking these wise men know that there would be a star of Jacob rise and they were looking for it and the star LED them straight up to Jerusalem where you'd think everybody would know what they were looking for up and down the streets where is he this born King of the Jews we saw saw his star in the east and after two years two years of those Shepherds preaching a message we know where he is we know where you can find him that great religious Capital still didn't have the answer or know nothing about it I think about that after all these years of the greatest message to be ever preached has been preached around the world and all these denominational systems don't know nothing about where you can find Christ where are you going to find the son of man but Shepherds had the answer Shepherds that a lot of people and I'll be closing in just a minute I'm not going to go long tonight Shepherds that most of the world just look down on Shepherds that maybe maybe people in the church think well they just don't even like me every time they preach all they got to do is they got to meddle in people's business and and preach on stuff that I wish they wouldn't preach on but Shepherds had the answer it was Shepherd what a strange things that God was set it up his patterns so you'd come to church all the sheep that want to be sociable would come to church and hear a Shepherd a little lonely person that that has no background no credentials why cuz Shepherds Shepherds were happy they were at ease with where Christ was born in that manger bride amongst all of the bleeding of the Lambs and all the the cows and the mooing and all the uh the the dirty thing they were fine they were comfortable shepherds are comfortable God knows where to send his messag God knows who's going to be comfortable with it what an honor how fitting it is to a Shepherd to receive a message of a newborn sheep it could come to nothing else but a Shepherd the Shepherds heard that the Messi that the Messiah was on Earth and came into his presence right in their own environment and found the message to be true was Vindicated there how that must have made those men feel to find that God had done this great thing for them now that's the confession of any real sheep to how great it is to recognize what God has done for you that he bypassed all the religious world he bypassed all these great religious writers you could think about this that you could go in the bookstore and pull off the book off the shelves all these all these great books that great theologians have written but God bypassed them to give it to you cuz you would receive it he' give it to you some of them her hers might not might not have even been able to sign their own name but he called them and give it to them poor humble Shepherds that had no education with a message what was their message I can prove it to you that this is the baby this is the messenger now that's crowd of statement in it and that is why this is not just kind of an intellectual Affair a real Revelation comes with power I'm talking about power to demonstrate the gospel power to make this word live and that is what the shepherd's message was power to talk about a living a living God they didn't go to that down to Bethlehem to see just a little a little dead baby laying in the manger or or just like a book laying in the manger but they went to see a living Christ a living baby that would open his mouth and cry a living baby that did baby things a living baby that's what this message is a Living Word it's got to be alive it's got to be alive in you and I I I was reading I was going back and reading all these quotes for brother R said the evidence of the new birth is not just knowing things it's that's part of it but it's got to be alive in you you have got to see something change in your life you've got to see something something happen in you and when it happens in you then you then you've got something that you can share with the world that's what those Shepherds were testifying of that Jesus Christ is not dead he's alive he's here today Shepherds praising God going around telling everybody that God is alive that he's still he's still a present tense god brother R said it's so simple that's how the wise overlooks it it's so simple it confounds them they look for a god way out there when he's right here when he's right here right here in this building tonight right here where we Overlook they're looking for something way Yonder when it's right here with them now Christ risen from the dead the same yesterday today and forever thank God that we know what to do with the word brother said they were the only kind that would accept him they knowed how to take care of it and so is it today when we get the Lamb's message and we'll close we'll close on this we're going to close a little bit earlier tonight that thank God that we know what to do what do we do with it as the musicians come forward receive it believe it respond and praise God about it you know when that's why those angels were singing because there's always singing at a birth there's always singing When God well I'm talking about praise when God does something for you you might be in your shower you might be in your beside your bed at night but when God does something for you you ain't going to be able to help but respond right God wants somebody to just receive him and believe his word you love the Lord tonight let's stand let's stand and and and sing and Worship the Lord for a little bit [Music] Hallelujah is here amen he is here holy holy I will bless his name again he is he closely hear him calling out your name he is here you can touch him you will never be the same he is here hallelujah he is here I believe that that he is here now if he is here whatever you have need of why don't you just go ahead and claim it if you need that Wayward loved one that little Lost Child Whatever It Is God can still reach out and move and begin to woo and draw that heart whatever you have need of just look to him and receive him and believe him you can touch him you will never be the same amen he's still here drawing thank God that it's not by man but we have a God that's drawing us and calling us to him brother Ram said he just wants to get somebody that he can mold them into where he can do something with them now what a thing that God can take somebody that is contrary to him and draw him to himself and make them to where he can do something with them make them to where he can use them to preach the gospel or witness to somebody at work or give a word of encouragement you know there's Paul told us that there's a lot of gifts in the body there's Gifts of helps there's Gifts of Ministries there's Gifts of all kinds of things maybe in the parking lot there's a gift somebody walk up to you and tell you something encouraging and that's what God is doing to our lives as he grabs a hold of us and begins to change us to be like him how could we doubt that he is here he's here in us behind Badger skins amen he's here in US you love him tonight Church let's just go to the Lord in prayer and then we just be dismissed Lord God we're so grateful to you Lord God for the word that you've given to us I pray Lord that you'll be with all the different saints that couldn't be here tonight Lord be with brother Louise and brother Eric Lord as he's trying to come to Atlanta and God I pray you'll move on the scene for that situation Lord and Grant it Lord that you'll guide our brother to a flight to get him Lord where he won't have to spend the night in the airport Lord I pray you'll be with brother way Lord Lord Jesus I pray you'll bless him Lord Jesus with a with a deer whatever he's looking for up there Lord Jesus that you'll guide him Lord be with all of us Lord as we go our separate ways Lord that you'll guide us and keep us on the road Lord Jesus Lord as we lord as we coming up to the threshold of another year Lord I pray Lord that you'll just let everyone be so consecrated to you in the new year Lord lay down all these weights that so easily beset us Lord Jesus Lord get rid of all these little foxes Lord that so that spoil the vine and help us Lord to be so dedicated to you Lord cuz that's what it's going to take to step over from the natural to the supernatural Lord I pray that you'll just be with us all Lord be with your Saints now as they go their ways Lord we ask in your name amen God bless [Music] you [Music] hallelu
