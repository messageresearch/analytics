[15:56] body
[15:57] they had tried to find skin to do skin
[15:59] grafts but he was just burnt so bad i
[16:01] think the only place they could find
[16:02] skin that wasn't burnt was under his
[16:04] belt and maybe in the bottoms of his
[16:06] shoes and his feet he was severely
[16:08] burned
[16:10] and
[16:11] can't be sad for him
[16:13] when you think about it that's rough but
[16:15] but you still think about it man where
[16:16] he's at now rejoicing in a new body no
[16:18] pain no hurting amen but
[16:21] certainly want to be praying for his
[16:22] family that's for sure amen sister
[16:24] daughter reached out to me and said they
[16:26] were they were hurting really bad the
[16:27] family was really hurt and bad so
[16:29] amen god's able
[16:31] god certainly able amen
[16:33] all right let's just bow our heads one
[16:35] more time before we get started here

[16:40] you for
[16:42] lord jesus just this his chance one more
[16:44] time lord to get together

[16:48] and there's coming a time lord we know
[16:50] that there'll be a time soon lord jesus
[16:52] when we won't be able to do this lord
[16:54] when the last church service will have
[16:56] been
[16:58] done lord the last song will be sung
[17:00] here lord
[17:02] god we know that time is soon coming
[17:05] lord jesus we just want to
[17:07] look faithfully forward dear god to that
[17:09] time lord because we know what's in
[17:11] store for us we know the joy this
[17:14] waiting just be on the way
[17:16] the lord we just pray help us lord to be
[17:18] faithful here this afternoon and going
[17:20] forward lord jesus take these words lord
[17:23] that you've given us these words of life
[17:24] lord and
[17:25] dear god just let them live inside of us
[17:27] give us a faith dear god that will
[17:29] surpass anything lord this world has
[17:32] here below
[17:34] the lord bless us now we ask in jesus
[17:36] name amen
[17:38] amen daniel chapter 10
[17:41] again same as this morning but i'm going
[17:43] to read
[17:44] i'm just gonna read one verse verse one
[17:46] later on we we may make it i don't know
[17:48] i won't promise but we may make it a
[17:50] little bit further down but i'm gonna
[17:51] just read verse one for right now
[17:53] and the scripture says of course in the
[17:54] third year of cyrus king of persia a
[17:57] thing
[17:58] was revealed unto daniel and i'm going
[18:00] to stop right there god bless you you
[18:01] may be seated amen
[18:04] all righty i'm
[18:07] actually just trying to get myself back
[18:09] to where i
[18:11] i left off this morning i think i was
[18:13] talking about jesus cursing the the fig
[18:16] tree
[18:17] and uh no men eat from the
[18:19] from henceforth forever i mean done that
[18:22] tree is done for right it's gone and uh
[18:26] and then i hit on the on our theophanies
[18:28] and thought of our theophanies and it
[18:30] was done as far as i was going up here
[18:32] amen i was completely out there's no way
[18:34] to get back to the thought and the notes
[18:36] here so
[18:37] it happens that way sometimes amen it
[18:39] certainly does and there's nothing wrong
[18:40] with that but uh brother branham said if
[18:42] the bullet ever gets off target you've
[18:43] got the only way you can fix it if you
[18:45] bring it back and start all over again
[18:47] don't worry i'm not going back all the
[18:49] way to the beginning and try to preach
[18:50] that over again amen but i do i'm going
[18:53] to try to get back with where we're at
[18:54] and and go from there
[18:56] so we were we were talking about faith
[18:59] of course only belief right only belief
[19:02] believe the thing that that was revealed
[19:05] to you that's what we had come to there
[19:07] don't doubt don't doubt it you know
[19:10] sometimes you don't see as we were
[19:12] talking about with jesus sometimes you
[19:13] don't see the results perhaps but if
[19:15] it's a true revelation
[19:17] it's going to bring forth amen
[19:19] god will bring it from the roots up
[19:20] he'll build it right he'll put a
[19:22] foundation in amen and that's that's
[19:24] just settled it's established it's going
[19:26] to be and we say praise the lord for
[19:28] that
[19:29] don't doubt it
[19:30] don't say that again don't doubt it
[19:32] right
[19:33] don't doubt the word of faith because
[19:34] that's what it is it's a word of faith
[19:36] that's god to give you and you've got
[19:37] once you once you have that once god has
[19:39] given you that spot for whatever it is
[19:41] here whether you're you're young and
[19:42] it's a word of salvation or something
[19:44] you're looking for maybe something a
[19:46] calling that god's put in your life or
[19:48] you know there's any myriad of things
[19:50] that it can be that how god reveals
[19:52] himself to you but once that
[19:54] that that personal faith is settled down
[19:56] there don't doubt it
[19:58] don't doubt it hold on to it and listen
[20:01] if you got a doubt
[20:03] sometimes he's like i just can't help it
[20:05] i can't help doubting you some some
[20:07] people are like that some folks are like
[20:09] that
[20:10] well if you're going to doubt if you got
[20:11] a doubt if you just got to doubt well
[20:13] then doubt your doubts
[20:17] and his sister years ago she would
[20:18] always say my brother what if and
[20:20] brother what if she was worried to death
[20:21] she was always worried and upset and
[20:23] everything never settled brother what if
[20:25] what if and i said but what if not
[20:28] i mean my what if not is just as is
[20:30] liable to happen is your what if
[20:33] you know you don't know to doubt your
[20:35] doubts if you have to doubt and that
[20:36] devil's going to bring that stuff there
[20:37] but just doubt your doubt on the thing
[20:39] faith has a much better track record
[20:42] than doubts do
[20:44] faith works 100 of the time right amen
[20:47] faith works every time that it's used so
[20:50] amen and doubt fails every time that
[20:52] it's used
[20:53] amen so if you got it out just doubt the
[20:55] right thing doubt your doubts have faith
[20:56] in your faith
[20:58] have faith in your faith i like that
[21:00] amen so praise the lord through faith
[21:02] genuine faith there must be revelation
[21:03] straight from god that so anyways so
[21:05] this is the thing we were talking about
[21:07] daniel and i'm trying my best to get to
[21:08] daniel here but this is the the thing
[21:10] that was revealed to daniel it was a a
[21:13] revelation
[21:15] and you go back and you begin looking
[21:16] and i like looking at words sometimes
[21:18] and and this word thing here uh we think
[21:21] what thing was revealed unto daniel i
[21:24] just love the way that was phrased there
[21:25] it sounds like something somebody from
[21:27] plainville would say uh that thing that
[21:28] was revealed
[21:30] that word thing there actually i love it
[21:32] it's it's not like we would think a
[21:34] thing would be well you know this pencil
[21:36] could be a thing um
[21:38] this this this mic here could be a thing
[21:41] uh my my bible physically speaking could
[21:44] be a thing it's an object it's a noun
[21:46] but
[21:47] actually in the hebrew words when we go
[21:48] back and we look at this word it's not a
[21:50] noun
[21:52] and it's not it's not an object it's not
[21:54] even an object when you go back and you
[21:55] begin looking at this word here this
[21:57] word thing here it it means actually
[22:01] speech
[22:03] and words
[22:05] and and even more speaking so it's an
[22:07] active and more than a it's not a it's
[22:09] not a noun it's actually a verb it's
[22:11] it's the action or the speaking the
[22:14] speech that is spoken the words that are
[22:17] spoken
[22:18] in message terms you know in modern day
[22:21] message terms we would call this thing
[22:23] the spoken word
[22:25] praise the lord a thing was revealed
[22:27] unto daniel here it was a spoken word
[22:29] that was revealed to daniel here amen
[22:32] right remember faith we're talking about
[22:34] faith now
[22:35] without faith that is imp impossible to
[22:38] please god
[22:39] without this thing
[22:42] it is impossible to please god what
[22:44] pleases god
[22:46] his word pleases god amen that's why he
[22:50] said it that way without faith without a
[22:52] true revelation it is impossible
[22:54] to please him amen
[22:56] but with faith all things are possible
[22:59] all things are possible amen praise the
[23:01] lord so so here only believe
[23:04] again you say lord
[23:05] i believe i believe i feel i might feel
[23:08] terrible but lord i believe right i
[23:10] might have all kind of circumstances
[23:12] around me but lord i believe i believe
[23:14] there's a thing that has been revealed
[23:16] to me and that thing that was revealed
[23:18] to daniel is this spoken word and the
[23:21] spoken word is the original seed right
[23:25] it's what god saw in the very beginning
[23:27] what he had in his mind he began to
[23:29] speak that in that word it was a living
[23:32] word it was speech god put it to speech
[23:34] and and we know that in the beginning
[23:36] god dwelt along with his thoughts there
[23:38] and those thoughts of course were
[23:39] eternal thoughts because god is eternal
[23:42] right brother branham said they were
[23:43] perfect thoughts they were not they were
[23:45] not thoughts that had to be fleshed out
[23:47] or worked or changed or taken back or
[23:50] anything but they were perfect right
[23:51] from the start they were eternal
[23:53] thoughts
[23:55] that blows my mind
[23:58] i have thoughts and my thoughts begin
[24:00] somewhere and then they kind of get lost
[24:02] along the way but god's thoughts are
[24:03] eternal they have no beginning and no
[24:06] ending
[24:08] i took a journal one time and said
[24:09] because my thoughts get so disjointed
[24:11] and i have a hard time reining them in
[24:13] and that's i'm going to try to journal
[24:14] i'm going to try to put it down in a
[24:15] book and and where i can kind of keep
[24:17] order you know try to order my thoughts
[24:19] i made it one page that was it i said
[24:22] there's no way
[24:23] i put it down six months later i pick it
[24:25] back up let's try this again forget it
[24:27] it don't work my thoughts are just they
[24:29] just don't line up like that but god's
[24:31] thoughts are not such as that god's
[24:33] thoughts were perfect from the very
[24:34] beginning
[24:37] but you know what they lacked
[24:40] he said how can god's thoughts lack
[24:42] anything
[24:43] they lack express expression
[24:46] right
[24:47] so you could have all the thoughts in
[24:48] the world i can think a lot of things
[24:50] but
[24:51] what does it do
[24:52] right
[24:53] the brothers we were talking about gps
[24:56] and we're talking about the gps system
[24:58] out there you know after after church
[25:00] this morning and
[25:01] there's a survey or we we utilize all
[25:03] sorts of things the satellites and such
[25:05] as that but
[25:06] uh there was a time like i got out of
[25:08] surveying for a while about 2003 and
[25:10] there was your gps was starting to come
[25:12] out
[25:13] but uh but we did a lot of
[25:15] we did a lot of uh subdivision work and
[25:18] road work and we'd have to go in and
[25:19] we'd you know the surveyors had to put
[25:21] the you know 100 stakes on your back and
[25:23] a hammer and you'd go trodden out
[25:25] through there you know it's plodding
[25:26] through the hot sun you'd be pounding
[25:28] these steaks in to lay out a center line
[25:30] and lay out the lines for the lots and
[25:32] all these things
[25:33] and and i and i i got out of it for a
[25:36] while and as i was out me and my wife
[25:37] were going down the road one day and we
[25:39] and going down the interstate and i see
[25:40] this this this truck this transfer go by
[25:42] and it it was a a caterpillar
[25:45] you know like heavy equipment
[25:47] caterpillar company truck going by and
[25:48] had a big picture of a bulldozer on it
[25:50] and it goes by and i just had this this
[25:53] duh
[25:54] you know you know those thoughts that
[25:55] you get sometimes it's just like man
[25:58] that's it you know
[25:59] and and it was a thought of putting i
[26:01] said if i could take a gps
[26:04] and i could put it on that bulldozer
[26:06] that gps would know where it's at and it
[26:09] would be able you know that gps would be
[26:10] able to tell that dozer and the blade
[26:12] where it's at the the elevation needs to
[26:14] be and it'd be able to go through there
[26:16] and be putting a lot of the surveyors
[26:18] out of work but man i could make a
[26:19] million bucks on this thing
[26:21] and immediately i got on my phone while
[26:23] we were going got on my cell phone i got
[26:24] on my phone and i called my buddy who
[26:26] was still in the surveying who i'm
[26:27] partners with now and i called him i
[26:29] said buddy i got a million dollar idea
[26:31] and he said what
[26:34] and i said i told him what i was
[26:35] thinking he's a dutch
[26:37] you're about two years too late
[26:41] and i said what
[26:42] he said yeah they've already done it
[26:44] they've done it and you're right it
[26:46] works just that way and i was like oh
[26:48] man that's just the way things work with
[26:50] me i'm always a little slow on that so i
[26:52] have these thoughts but unless you can
[26:54] take that thought and you can you can
[26:56] express it you can put it out there then
[26:58] it's just a thought it really doesn't do
[27:00] anything right
[27:02] so you see what god's trying to do with
[27:04] you right
[27:05] you see why he said without faith it's
[27:06] impossible without this spoken word
[27:09] without this revelation it's impossible
[27:10] to please god because his whole purpose
[27:12] is to express these thoughts that he had
[27:15] in his mind
[27:17] i mean you were such an intricate part
[27:19] of the word of god you don't even
[27:20] realize that we think of a lot of times
[27:22] just a nominal type of way of thinking
[27:24] that god so loved the world before for
[27:26] god to love the world that he sent his
[27:27] only begotten son that that whosoever
[27:29] will and you know all these and when we
[27:31] have this and it's almost like god's
[27:32] reaching down and and taking pity on
[27:34] some lost puppy dog
[27:37] and he's he's trying to he's he saved
[27:38] you somehow and he picks you up and he
[27:40] he you're a rescue dog or a rescue mutt
[27:43] or whatever and god loves you and that's
[27:45] fine and he might take you in his house
[27:46] and you can be like a lap dog to him or
[27:48] something and that would all be
[27:49] wonderful you know like that but don't
[27:51] you realize you are so much more
[27:54] than that
[27:56] you are a son of god you are a daughter
[27:59] of god you are a part of the word that
[28:02] he had in his mind before the foundation
[28:04] of the world and he has done everything
[28:07] even so much as going and dying on the
[28:09] cross so that you could come back to him
[28:14] that's awesome
[28:16] that's awesome
[28:19] and that's the thing
[28:22] that he's trying to get across
[28:24] right from genesis to revelation that is
[28:26] the theme
[28:28] of the whole bible it speaks redemption
[28:32] all the way through cycle after cycle
[28:34] after cycle god just knocking at your
[28:37] heart and saying see what i'm trying to
[28:39] do
[28:40] see that how much i love you see how
[28:42] much i want you see how much i desire to
[28:45] to to bring you back to that place of
[28:47] fellowship look at who you are church
[28:53] so god spoke
[28:56] words or thoughts thoughts
[28:58] but then god spoke
[29:01] and the thoughts began to exp to be
[29:03] expressed praise the lord now of course
[29:05] how do you express thoughts you put them
[29:07] into words and the words the words are
[29:10] the origin there so so in this case the
[29:12] the eternal thought of god that was
[29:14] expressed was in the beginning the very
[29:16] beginning we call it what the logos all
[29:18] right and and the logos which is the
[29:20] spoken word of god
[29:22] which is jesus christ
[29:24] which is michael which is the pillar of
[29:26] fire you can look at all these things
[29:28] here but this thing that that was
[29:30] revealed to daniel this spoken word that
[29:32] was to be manifested it was manifesting
[29:35] redemption cycle this very thing that
[29:37] was in the in the mind of god from the
[29:39] beginning
[29:41] and the spoken word was manifest to to
[29:44] create things
[29:46] that god had in his great mind before
[29:49] there was anything in creation these
[29:50] these eternal things these these godly
[29:53] things
[29:58] and he spoke
[30:00] and it was it just was
[30:04] glory
[30:06] hallelujah
[30:07] it just was it was it came into
[30:09] existence and
[30:11] and it wasn't hindered now we know that
[30:13] when god spoke he the bible says that he
[30:15] had to believe his own words right
[30:17] brother branham said he said god when
[30:18] god spoke he literally he had to have
[30:20] faith again it's impossible to please
[30:23] god without faith
[30:24] he had to have faith in his own words so
[30:27] even to god god had a revelation
[30:30] he had a revelation
[30:32] on his own
[30:34] words that's awesome
[30:37] praise the lord
[30:39] that he had actually had to have faith
[30:40] in his own words and he he believed his
[30:43] words and it wasn't hindered his faith
[30:46] wasn't hindered he had no doubt when god
[30:48] spoke let there be light he had no doubt
[30:50] that it was going to be light
[30:53] right there's no doubt in god
[30:55] it wasn't hindered
[30:58] ever how long it took it to come into
[31:00] coming to come to pass it wasn't
[31:02] hindered
[31:03] brother branham made this statement one
[31:04] time he talked about things you know
[31:06] things that we look and he said well
[31:08] science and and
[31:09] and faith don't really line up a lot of
[31:11] times and they were talking about
[31:12] dinosaurs and they were talking about
[31:14] this and that and everything else and
[31:16] they said the timeline don't work and
[31:18] brother branham said listen he said god
[31:19] said you know in the beginning right
[31:22] he began to speak it was there and he
[31:23] said but and then the world was without
[31:25] forming
[31:26] and and void
[31:28] he said but a lot of things happened
[31:30] between that time that's period but
[31:32] there's a lot of things that space could
[31:33] happen between that time
[31:35] but you know one thing that didn't
[31:36] happen in between that that period
[31:38] between when god said and there was form
[31:40] there was chaos ruled forgive me my
[31:42] words are going completely out of my
[31:43] mind
[31:44] the chaos ruled and all these things and
[31:46] and and then he comes down and god began
[31:48] to create he said there's that space of
[31:49] time there but one thing that did not
[31:51] exist in that time
[31:53] was doubt
[31:56] that time regardless of how much chaos
[31:58] was there regardless of how much was
[32:01] there one time brother brown would talk
[32:02] about a pre-adamic state
[32:05] he talked about the dinosaurs that might
[32:06] have been something that we just don't
[32:07] need to know about it was before this
[32:09] and that and everything else he says
[32:11] that
[32:12] but all that chaos and everything was
[32:14] there it did nothing to hinder the faith
[32:16] of god
[32:19] saints you got a lot of chaos in your
[32:20] life
[32:23] did i hit that right
[32:25] i do
[32:26] i do amen i've already got today i
[32:29] already got people calling i'm not gonna
[32:30] be able to be there tomorrow we can't do
[32:31] this then and this one's coming in there
[32:33] and then i'm like just forget it this is
[32:34] sunday i am not thinking about that
[32:37] this is a day for faith right
[32:39] not for scrambling trying to get things
[32:41] done but you look at all the things that
[32:42] we have going on in our life all the
[32:44] things are there one thing that we have
[32:46] to realize is that above all through all
[32:49] overall we have faith right and that
[32:52] faith is unhindered
[32:54] that faith is unhindered
[32:56] it just is because god spoke that's what
[32:59] it is this is the thing that's being
[33:00] revealed god spoke
[33:02] he spoke speech words speaking
[33:06] he spoke this thing so now so here's a
[33:08] principle it's a very simple principle
[33:10] this is not something you don't know
[33:11] here but here's a principle a scriptural
[33:13] principle that that god has to speak
[33:18] there's a thought
[33:20] but before that thought can really take
[33:21] place in your life he has to speak it to
[33:23] you you can take the word these are the
[33:26] thoughts of god right
[33:28] this is the word of god we say this is
[33:29] the word of god but you know we can look
[33:31] down here and we can see this these
[33:32] words but as long as these words are
[33:34] just right here in our head
[33:36] no matter how true that is it's not
[33:38] really reality to us yet
[33:41] it's not really real yet right it's not
[33:43] a revelation it's just something we've
[33:44] read here but these are the thoughts of
[33:46] god
[33:47] you don't know what god thinks about you
[33:49] read your bible
[33:51] i look at a man tell me one time he said
[33:53] we we can't know us this little
[33:55] finite creatures we cannot know the mind
[33:57] of god i said yes we can
[33:59] he said no we can't know the mind of god
[34:01] we're too little we're to this we're too
[34:03] sinful we're all these things i said we
[34:05] can know and we better know the mind of
[34:07] god in our lives and the way that we
[34:09] know it this is what he thinks
[34:12] this is the word of god from cover to
[34:14] cover this is the word of god this is
[34:16] the revelation the complete revelation
[34:18] of jesus christ who is god right
[34:21] this is it right here you want to know
[34:22] what god's thinking this is it
[34:24] but before this can be i'm forgive me if
[34:27] i sound like i'm repeating myself i'm
[34:28] just trying to nail the
[34:30] beat the nailed home i guess but but
[34:32] before you if you want to have the
[34:33] thoughts right here before these
[34:34] thoughts can be expressed god's got to
[34:36] speak it somewhere
[34:40] he's got to speak it to you
[34:43] so before it can be
[34:46] god has to speak
[34:48] and we read in the book of daniel and
[34:49] god spoke to daniel and then he said
[34:52] there the thing was revealed to him
[34:56] now hebrew word for the word thing there
[34:59] is dhaba
[35:00] and it quite literally means again
[35:02] speech
[35:03] word
[35:04] speaking
[35:06] saying utterance
[35:09] so you can see this is this is not just
[35:10] an inanimate kind of thing
[35:13] if you want just a pew sitting church
[35:15] going experience
[35:17] that's not what this message is supposed
[35:18] to be
[35:20] that is not what this thing is this is
[35:22] supposed to be quite literally it is a
[35:24] it's utterance it's not inanimate it's
[35:26] an action thing
[35:28] right
[35:30] that's why i like seeing your head amen
[35:32] that's why you're a preacher like seeing
[35:33] a man and the head's nodding and people
[35:35] engaging and everything else because
[35:36] listen it's not just the preacher the
[35:38] preacher is just he just gets up here
[35:39] and and whatever he wants to be the lord
[35:41] take him and use him whichever but you
[35:43] know you're the one that's actually
[35:44] participating
[35:46] it's not you're not to be inanimate
[35:47] objects sitting there no matter how
[35:49] tired you are or whatever you're not
[35:50] supposed to just be sitting there and be
[35:52] an inanimate object we're supposed to be
[35:54] we're supposed to be a a relationship
[35:56] back and forth with god something that's
[35:57] living a living love that's there
[36:01] dabba it quite literally again it means
[36:03] speech word speaking utterance
[36:07] it's not something that is described as
[36:09] a noun
[36:11] but it's living
[36:13] it is action
[36:15] it's that which has living breath behind
[36:18] it
[36:19] oh my
[36:22] and this word dabba actually originates
[36:25] from a word it comes from the root word
[36:28] dobber
[36:29] same thing but has an r on the end of it
[36:32] which means in my my playable language
[36:34] is butchered that i know but it means
[36:36] not just to speak now now we're not just
[36:38] speaking
[36:40] we're not just babblers
[36:42] but it literally it means to declare
[36:46] and it's not like a declaration that's
[36:48] being made but it's not declare it's the
[36:50] action
[36:51] of declaring right so so this speaker
[36:54] god is literally when he when he begins
[36:56] to speak these words when these words
[36:58] these thoughts are put into words he's
[37:00] actually declaring right then he's
[37:01] making a declaration it's so
[37:06] by my stripes you are
[37:08] healed
[37:09] right
[37:11] you know i i he he bled he died for you
[37:14] you you are saved you are a part of god
[37:17] you're a part of me
[37:19] i know the thoughts that i had of you
[37:22] right
[37:23] good thoughts thoughts to bring you to a
[37:24] perfect end
[37:26] praise the lord
[37:28] he has these thoughts it's to declare
[37:31] and to converse as in a
[37:34] relationship again a conversation
[37:36] converse
[37:37] but to command and also to promise
[37:41] and then there's
[37:43] connotations of to warn
[37:46] threaten
[37:48] but then to sing i don't know why they
[37:50] didn't put sing over with the other part
[37:52] there while they put it after the threat
[37:53] and the warn but but then also to sing
[37:55] amen but regardless this is not just
[37:58] these are not just idle words being
[38:00] spoken this this thing that's revealed
[38:02] to daniel these are not just idle words
[38:04] that are spoken by some babbler or or or
[38:07] some meaningless words they're they're
[38:09] breathed out by a madman have you ever
[38:11] been around people and sometimes i have
[38:13] that problem but have you ever heard the
[38:14] term word salad
[38:18] you've never heard the word the term
[38:19] word salad
[38:21] my wife has because i use it sometimes
[38:24] word salad is when when when when
[38:26] sometimes people get to talking and
[38:28] they're just filling the space the quiet
[38:31] they don't know how to appreciate the
[38:32] quiet
[38:35] and they'll start talking
[38:37] but the words it's really nothing it's
[38:39] just words it's just meaningless it's
[38:41] just babel
[38:42] and you're sitting there in your head
[38:44] the guy that's listening and sitting
[38:45] here saying what is he saying
[38:48] what does this mean and then you realize
[38:50] it don't mean nothing
[38:53] it literally don't mean nothing he's
[38:54] just he's just filling the space
[38:59] praise the lord that's not our god
[39:02] when god says something
[39:04] i knew one time i can't remember now but
[39:06] i knew one time how many words are in
[39:08] the king james bible 16 11 version bible
[39:10] how many actual words are in there it's
[39:12] a lot
[39:14] and there's not one of them that is
[39:16] meaningless
[39:18] it's even more than that you can read
[39:20] between the lines
[39:21] and not a bit of that is meaningless it
[39:23] has a purpose to it right
[39:25] praise the lord
[39:27] praise the lord saints amen they have
[39:29] these words they they have meaning and
[39:31] they have purpose
[39:32] and they also they have direction god
[39:35] knows his thoughts because he's bringing
[39:37] and then he's bringing you to that
[39:38] promised end that that perfect end there
[39:41] right he's bringing you someplace so
[39:43] these words they have they have purpose
[39:45] and they also have a direction to them
[39:49] it's the words of god it's amazing here
[39:51] god don't again you know people the
[39:52] different denominations the different
[39:54] the nominal christians they'll take a
[39:55] promise here this is my favorite bible
[39:57] quote
[39:58] and that's fine and we all got that
[40:00] right but this is my favorite part and
[40:02] and all this over here is this and this
[40:03] and there's no connection between them
[40:05] really it's just it's just something
[40:06] that you pick out randomly through there
[40:08] but god's really not do that all these
[40:10] the words tied together brother branham
[40:12] said you can take any part of the
[40:13] scripture and it can tie the rest of the
[40:16] bible together
[40:17] and he says and you can look through
[40:19] here and you can find jesus christ in
[40:21] every verse of this bible he said if you
[40:23] don't see him in every verse go back and
[40:25] read it again because you missed
[40:27] something
[40:28] well that something that people miss is
[40:30] they miss the purpose and the direction
[40:33] of god
[40:35] they miss the perf the purpose of god
[40:37] god has a purpose his purpose is to
[40:39] bring you back to himself
[40:42] and
[40:42] and to bring you into that perfect image
[40:45] that he saw before the foundation of the
[40:47] world
[40:48] and there's a direction to that praise
[40:50] the lord
[40:51] there's a direction to that what did he
[40:53] say the footsteps of the righteous are
[40:56] ordered
[40:57] of the lord
[40:59] you know what happens when you order
[41:01] footsteps
[41:02] you go somewhere right you're not
[41:04] stumbling around and everything else you
[41:06] look like this and you know you take a
[41:08] drunk man and he's stumbling around and
[41:09] everything else and you look at his feet
[41:11] footprints and your brother brandon
[41:12] talked about the young boy that was
[41:13] trying to follow in the footsteps of his
[41:15] dad and his dad through the snow and
[41:17] he's going out there and his dad looks
[41:18] back and his son's trying to you know do
[41:19] this and everything else it's because
[41:21] the dad was drunk and he was leaving
[41:23] drunken footsteps through the snow
[41:25] and he said he got convicted over that
[41:27] oh look my son's trying to follow me and
[41:29] what am i what example am i leaving him
[41:31] right
[41:33] but the order of god is he he carries
[41:35] you somewhere it's got a direction he's
[41:36] got a purpose to it and we can look at
[41:38] his footsteps through the bible and we
[41:40] can walk in those footsteps amen and we
[41:42] bring forth an image the image that he
[41:44] had in his mind before the foundation of
[41:46] the world
[41:48] praise the lord
[41:50] your footsteps are ordered of the lord
[41:54] they are manifested words that are
[41:56] spoken words of god and they are alive
[41:58] with the predestinated purpose of god
[42:04] aren't you glad god has a purpose for
[42:05] you
[42:10] and god has a purpose
[42:12] for every bit of revelation he has
[42:14] poured in your life right
[42:18] just have faith saints have faith
[42:21] so this thing
[42:23] this thing that daniel's talking about i
[42:26] believe it's still being revealed today
[42:28] i believe it's still going forth today
[42:30] it's an eternal word
[42:33] this thing that was in god's mind and in
[42:35] his heart and then was expressed in
[42:37] words
[42:39] and then these words that are very
[42:40] purposeful and they have a
[42:42] a definite direction to them and these
[42:44] these thoughts and then they're made
[42:46] words and then they're made real in
[42:48] creation and there's a pattern here
[42:50] that god follows through scripture we
[42:52] can begin to see a pattern there's a
[42:54] pattern here
[42:55] in the message who is this melchizedek
[42:57] brother branham
[42:58] lays out i didn't give the brothers that
[43:00] quote and i'm not going to read i'll
[43:01] just paraphrase it here but in the in
[43:03] the in the message who is this
[43:05] melchizedek brother branham lays out how
[43:07] god manifests himself again he said you
[43:09] know a threefold manner he's a thought
[43:11] word flesh
[43:13] i know you're very familiar with that
[43:14] this is nothing new to you i know but
[43:16] but so so god has has his thoughts he
[43:19] has these thoughts and then those
[43:21] thoughts are expressed in word form and
[43:22] then god believes his own word
[43:25] which he was
[43:27] and the word becomes flesh
[43:29] and blood creation
[43:31] now the principle here for our lives
[43:35] and i'm not just talking in theological
[43:37] terms in message we have our own
[43:39] theological terms we do
[43:41] and we can talk amongst ourselves and
[43:43] somebody on the outside of the message
[43:44] or whatever they look at you like what
[43:45] are you talking about you know
[43:48] i believe a message will say what
[43:50] message
[43:52] they have no clue what we're talking
[43:53] about right we've got our own terms and
[43:55] everything else with this and but but
[43:57] there's message theology but that's not
[43:58] what i'm doing here
[44:00] i'm talking about this thing that's in
[44:02] our lives today you see faith has no
[44:05] hindrances and this thing called faith
[44:08] in our lives
[44:10] it must be unhindered
[44:12] and the scriptural principle here is
[44:14] that before any thought of god can come
[44:16] to fruition in your life first god must
[44:19] speak if you want it unhindered
[44:21] god must speak
[44:26] that need that thing you've prayed for
[44:28] that thing you've longed for that
[44:30] whatever it might be that purpose you
[44:32] say well lord i see this in your word
[44:34] and you pray and you cry out to god i
[44:35] can see it there it's a thought of god
[44:37] but then you begin to cry out and and
[44:39] god begins to speak once he speaks to
[44:42] your heart
[44:45] once he speaks that word thought
[44:49] word right
[44:50] the thought
[44:52] word
[44:53] once that comes and it hits that heart
[44:55] there now
[44:57] we are at the thing
[45:00] now we're at the unhindered part
[45:03] now we're now we've that word has become
[45:05] anchored down in your soul
[45:07] and it just is
[45:09] it just is there's no other way to put
[45:11] it it just is that word is there i don't
[45:13] care what you say it just is
[45:18] faith has no hindrances
[45:24] all things are possible
[45:26] to me this brings a little bit of a
[45:28] different maybe a
[45:30] deeper understanding of only believe
[45:34] just only believe all things are
[45:36] possible to them that believe we take
[45:37] that scripture i'm sitting here there's
[45:39] a phone book they only believe some book
[45:40] here right and we say only believe and
[45:43] we think okay i need this and i go and i
[45:45] believe it lord i believe it i believe
[45:47] it i believe it i believe it i believe
[45:49] you you i believe it do you believe it i
[45:50] believe it
[45:51] but still until god speaks it
[45:55] you really are not believing yet right
[45:58] i'm really not believing it's just
[46:00] practical to all i'm doing here this
[46:02] afternoon
[46:05] so what do you do before it gets to that
[46:06] spot
[46:08] you cry out and you knock
[46:10] lord let this be a revelation in my
[46:12] heart
[46:13] too many times we pray and miss brother
[46:14] branham says we'll pray lord i i need
[46:16] healing
[46:18] i need healing to god i need my i need a
[46:20] touch i feel terrible i've got this i've
[46:22] got that and brother brandon that's the
[46:23] question and this is the strangest
[46:25] question for me for a long time
[46:28] he said why do you want to be healed
[46:34] well
[46:36] gee golly brother brother dale i want to
[46:38] be better i want to feel better
[46:41] right
[46:42] i i i want my back to stop hurting i
[46:45] want my i want my strength back in my
[46:46] legs i i want
[46:48] i want all i want i want to feel better
[46:50] i want to be back like i was before
[46:52] brother branham said that don't do it
[46:55] but lord you're a healer
[46:57] but you've got to believe well i believe
[46:59] you're a healer but now how do you
[47:00] believe has it been spoken to you yet
[47:02] right
[47:05] and brother branham said
[47:07] why do you want your healing is it just
[47:09] so that i'm again i'm paraphrasing here
[47:11] but is it just because you do you want
[47:12] to feel better
[47:14] or is it to manifest the word of god is
[47:16] it for his glory
[47:19] is it for his glory so you see where
[47:21] faith you see where i'm driving at it's
[47:22] very simple but you see what real faith
[47:24] gets down to real faith gets down to the
[47:26] purpose and the meaning and the
[47:28] direction of the word of god it comes to
[47:30] a place to where really everything that
[47:31] i'm doing i'm sick and i want to be
[47:33] better but i want to be better for the
[47:34] glory of god i want that word to be
[47:36] manifest
[47:39] but what if lord's wanting to manifest
[47:41] endurance and your steadfastness or
[47:44] endurance or something like that in your
[47:45] body abraham had to wait 25 years
[47:50] god could have given it just like that
[47:51] he was waiting on a body change why in
[47:53] the world did he have to wait 25 years
[47:55] on a body change and you think that's
[47:57] something job had to wait 3 500 years
[48:01] more or less
[48:03] he said i know that in you that my
[48:06] redeemer liveth
[48:08] in the last days he shall stand and i
[48:10] shall see him with my eyes not another
[48:14] one but with my eyes i'll see him and he
[48:16] was talking about the resurrection and
[48:18] then job got old and died and went to
[48:21] the grave his flesh rotted and his bones
[48:24] actually turned back to dust he was
[48:26] nothing but dust laying in a tomb but
[48:29] that word of god that he had confessed
[48:31] that he believed it was a revelation to
[48:34] him it was a seed laying there in that
[48:37] tomb and when jesus came back again job
[48:40] raised up and he could say i see him
[48:45] i see him there he is he saw him with
[48:47] his own eyes why because that word of
[48:49] god was a seed it was that thing
[48:53] that was revealed to him
[48:55] it was that word
[48:57] that was revealed to him oh saints
[49:00] praise the lord for the hour that you're
[49:02] living in
[49:03] that there has been a thing revealed to
[49:06] this last day
[49:07] the thing of jesus christ the same
[49:09] yesterday today and forever the
[49:11] revelation of jesus christ the same
[49:13] yesterday today and forever not just in
[49:15] the church ages not just in the nominal
[49:17] beliefs not in just all these things but
[49:18] in a real true presence and person of of
[49:21] god himself
[49:23] the word being manifested in lives in
[49:26] your lives you say oh if i could only
[49:28] have lived in the days of brother
[49:29] branham listen you're living in the days
[49:31] of the bride
[49:34] brother branham only spoke about your
[49:36] days
[49:37] you're living in the days that brother
[49:39] branham wanted to see
[49:42] he said i'm only laying the groundworks
[49:45] i'm only laying the groundwork here he
[49:47] said but there'll be another one come
[49:49] i'm sorry i'd if
[49:51] i don't i hope i'm not stepping on any
[49:53] toes here but i don't think there's an
[49:54] eighth one to come
[49:56] i'm not looking for another prophet to
[49:58] come
[49:59] they're prophets and gifts of prophecies
[50:01] and things like that but there's only
[50:03] one word prophet for this generation
[50:05] amen and he's come
[50:07] and he was speaking of you little bride
[50:10] he was speaking of your day he was
[50:12] speaking of the word of god that was
[50:13] being manifested in your life and here
[50:16] we are in a message church
[50:20] sitting under a message pastor
[50:23] that teaches a a a revealed word a
[50:25] message for this last day
[50:28] prophet long to see this day
[50:32] and people say oh for the days of a
[50:33] prophet
[50:36] i say oh for the days of the bride
[50:40] amen
[50:41] [Applause]
[50:47] so daniel daniel here we read daniel
[50:49] shows us this this very scriptural
[50:51] principle
[50:55] this principle that the prophet of god
[50:56] emphasized over and over throughout the
[50:58] message there again
[51:00] thoughts words
[51:02] flesh
[51:05] brother branham refers also to paul paul
[51:07] speaking to the romans here paul said in
[51:09] romans chapter 10 verse 17 he says so
[51:12] then faith cometh by hearing
[51:15] and hearing by the word of god
[51:19] and he he hid it you know brother
[51:21] branham hits it in this the quote we
[51:22] read this morning talking about the
[51:23] young mother and and the young mother
[51:25] there and said and she heard she heard
[51:27] that jesus healed epilepsy
[51:30] now faith cometh by hearing
[51:33] so she she'd heard
[51:36] words had to be spoken for her to be to
[51:39] have been able to hear these things
[51:42] she heard that but but now brother
[51:44] branham if you remember again he said
[51:46] that she so she tried to she wanted to
[51:48] get to jesus because she wanted to hear
[51:50] those words basically for herself
[51:54] she wanted it was one thing she'd heard
[51:56] she'd heard through testimony that god
[51:57] had healed epilepsy before
[52:00] perhaps it was the man that met him on
[52:01] the on the way down from when they came
[52:03] back from the mount transfiguration i
[52:04] don't know the timeline there but maybe
[52:06] it was the man that that had the son and
[52:07] brought his son to the disciples coming
[52:09] down from from from mount
[52:10] transfiguration and and while while
[52:12] jesus and james and john peter are up on
[52:14] the top of the mount here comes you know
[52:16] the man brings his son there and he's
[52:18] got epilepsy and the disciples are
[52:19] trying to cast them out but they could
[52:21] not right
[52:22] and then jesus comes down there and just
[52:23] gives us oh you have little faith right
[52:25] and he gives he gives the word there and
[52:27] he asks the man he said lord he said do
[52:28] you believe the man said i believe lord
[52:30] help mine unbelief that's an honest man
[52:32] right there
[52:34] help mine unbelief
[52:36] and jesus cast the devil out epilepsy
[52:38] maybe this woman maybe she'd heard that
[52:40] i don't know
[52:42] but she heard that jesus had healed
[52:44] epilepsy
[52:46] so what did she do she said oh i got to
[52:47] get to this man myself
[52:49] i got to go see jesus that's a good
[52:51] thing ain't it i need to go see jesus
[52:53] that's the problem today is that people
[52:54] don't want to go see jesus
[52:58] hello it's the truth
[53:00] they want to they want to read you can
[53:01] read your bible you do all kinds of
[53:03] things but do you sit down there and
[53:04] sign cry for the abominations it's done
[53:05] in the city in here lord help me
[53:09] help me
[53:12] so she goes she's heard that he heals
[53:14] epilepsy so she goes because she's
[53:16] looking for a a personal she's looking
[53:18] for a personal revelation now she wants
[53:20] to go hear him say that her daughter
[53:22] that her daughter has been healed now
[53:26] you see the word she she she saw the
[53:29] thoughts of god
[53:31] god's able to do it
[53:33] but now she's got to hear the word of
[53:34] god
[53:37] i had a neighbor that was dying of brain
[53:39] cancer
[53:41] he's a good man he was a good man
[53:43] baptist good baptist man but he was a
[53:44] good man
[53:46] and he's dying of brain cancer and and i
[53:48] was trying to
[53:49] to
[53:50] go up and i'd help him every day they he
[53:52] wanted to be outside so we'd have to
[53:54] he couldn't walk or anything we'd put a
[53:55] a wench in there and we'd winch him up
[53:57] and we'd sling him over and sit him down
[53:58] in a wheelchair we'd roll him outside he
[54:01] had a lazy boy chair set up on his
[54:02] garage where he could see outside and be
[54:04] on the outside there and we'd winch him
[54:06] up and we'd swing him over and sit him
[54:07] in his chair and he'd stay there all day
[54:10] long
[54:11] afternoon late afternoon towards evening
[54:13] you know he'd be tired just just tired
[54:15] and we'd go up there and we'd winch him
[54:17] back up put him in the chair and carry
[54:18] him back down back into his bedroom and
[54:20] we'd lay him back down winch him back up
[54:22] put him in his bed
[54:24] and i told him i said don
[54:28] jesus is a healer
[54:31] god can heal you
[54:33] you know what his words were and i had
[54:35] my own parents tell me the same thing
[54:36] they both died with cancer
[54:38] they both told me the same thing pretty
[54:39] much
[54:41] god can heal you
[54:44] and they all said
[54:46] i know
[54:47] that god can heal me
[54:50] if
[54:52] there's that bit of doubt in it
[54:55] if
[54:56] he wants to
[54:59] i told him
[55:05] he wants to
[55:06] he wants to heal you
[55:09] right he wants to bless you
[55:11] he wants to show his glory in you that's
[55:13] his desire today that's his desire to
[55:16] show his lord the manifest glory in you
[55:18] that's what he's longing to do he said
[55:20] if he wants to he can do it but you know
[55:22] i i don't know
[55:24] and then he made this statement dawn
[55:26] made the statement he said and i'm okay
[55:31] you see even fighting brain cancer he
[55:34] was in he really didn't have an
[55:36] understanding of his need
[55:39] and perhaps it was just
[55:41] it was his time to go and god was just
[55:43] carrying him out you know sometimes it
[55:45] is time to go
[55:48] but i just thought this church
[55:50] age
[55:51] has robbed the people
[55:54] of their true potential it's robbed them
[55:57] of faith they don't know how to have
[55:59] faith they don't know what faith is they
[56:01] don't know how to to look for the thing
[56:04] they're not seeking the thing they're
[56:06] seeking they can read the thoughts they
[56:08] can put things together and everything
[56:09] else but they don't know the thing the
[56:11] the thing of faith that revelation has
[56:13] not really been revealed to them that
[56:15] you may they may have the thoughts but
[56:16] it's not even made it down to word yet
[56:18] the principle is thought word god has to
[56:21] speak it
[56:22] to your heart
[56:26] it has to become real
[56:32] words have to be spoken
[56:37] and what were those words
[56:40] to that lady when jesus spoke
[56:43] they were the expression of the thoughts
[56:44] that god had for her circumstance for
[56:47] her daughter's condition
[56:49] did it die it just died it died i served
[56:51] too long
[56:55] it's all
[56:56] right why i don't wear one of those
[56:58] things at home
[57:00] we got
[57:01] we got two more batteries
[57:03] no we ain't doing that i don't know
[57:05] ain't that long
[57:07] thank you brother
[57:09] i saw that look i knew something was up
[57:11] as soon as i saw brother aaron get up
[57:13] and the sister turned around i'm like oh
[57:15] something happened
[57:17] i did it now oh i really did it now i
[57:19] just throw the cliff off of it
[57:21] okay i'm sticking in my pocket now
[57:28] you okay
[57:31] we can quit if y'all just want to give
[57:32] in to the devil
[57:34] [Laughter]
[57:39] all right
[57:42] that thing that was spoke
[57:46] in all seriousness i am so thankful
[57:48] for the thing that god's spoken this day
[57:55] amen
[57:56] amen
[57:59] [Applause]
[58:01] can you imagine what that must have been
[58:02] to that mother
[58:04] when that when that real word not just
[58:06] the thoughts but when that real word hit
[58:08] that your daughter can be made whole
[58:10] or is made whole
[58:12] you can have what you ask for
[58:15] i mean that that thing could you imagine
[58:17] such a thing such a thing
[58:20] when all the medical community said no
[58:22] there's no cure for epilepsy
[58:26] yet the seed of god planted in that
[58:27] little lady's heart
[58:29] it said yes
[58:32] thoughts
[58:33] made living
[58:34] words declarations
[58:37] promises
[58:39] commandments even
[58:41] this thing
[58:43] god reveals to his own
[58:45] those ones who are to bring forth his
[58:48] his word and continue down that path
[58:49] that thing
[58:51] that was revealed to daniel was god's
[58:52] word for his hour and his need and also
[58:55] for the ages to come
[58:57] god knew
[58:59] god knows
[59:01] god knew that we would need to look back
[59:03] and and hear
[59:04] that word spoke through daniel to
[59:06] believe in our day he he knew what we'd
[59:07] have to have
[59:10] the thing revealed to that little mother
[59:11] was the the thing that
[59:13] in god's mind for her need in her hour
[59:17] now what about our hour
[59:21] what about our need
[59:24] i need a new body
[59:26] i'll just be honest with you i need a
[59:28] new body
[59:31] i need to meet jesus in the air
[59:33] that's my need right
[59:35] that's my promise for today that's a
[59:37] promise for the day
[59:38] you rise we're sitting here brother
[59:39] branham said the generation that sees
[59:41] the fig tree put forth this bud
[59:43] it shall not pass until all things be
[59:46] fulfilled
[59:48] my goodness we're a long ways worth 74
[59:50] years or something like that since or
[59:52] passed now
[59:55] but that generation is still going
[59:57] amen
[59:59] that generation is still going
[1:00:02] we must have faith this undefeatable
[1:00:05] type of faith this unhindered type of
[1:00:07] faith faith that is unconscious easy
[1:00:10] faith that is doesn't have without
[1:00:12] anyone or anything making it difficult
[1:00:14] to do something or for something to
[1:00:16] happen it's not difficult it's not
[1:00:18] slowed down it's not blocked or
[1:00:21] interfered with without that spoken word
[1:00:23] delivered straight to your heart there
[1:00:26] can be none of that though
[1:00:28] because this is hindered
[1:00:31] the word can be read the word can be
[1:00:32] sympathized with the word can be
[1:00:34] understood with the with the intellect
[1:00:36] and all these things but without the
[1:00:37] word being spoken to your heart there
[1:00:39] can be no true faith oh thank god for
[1:00:42] faith
[1:00:44] thank god for a faith that anchored down
[1:00:46] in your heart and told you that you were
[1:00:47] a child of god right
[1:00:50] thank god for a faith that spoke down
[1:00:51] your heart and said man this message is
[1:00:54] true and i've got a new body waiting on
[1:00:55] me
[1:00:56] praise the lord
[1:00:58] you realize that the the the nominal
[1:01:00] churches out there they're not looking
[1:01:02] for for a new body so much now they
[1:01:04] they're many that believe in the rapture
[1:01:05] and all the different things like that
[1:01:07] but but you know they're just looking
[1:01:08] for a grave somewhere
[1:01:10] and if it be
[1:01:14] i was talking to a man once a a we were
[1:01:17] doing a job for a man and he was a
[1:01:18] member of some some new church there in
[1:01:20] our areas a big church had drawn a big
[1:01:23] crowd and everything else and and they
[1:01:24] were kind of charismatic and and we were
[1:01:27] to be honest with you i was having a
[1:01:28] good time with the dude yeah we were
[1:01:29] sitting out there talking we were
[1:01:30] talking about jesus we were talking
[1:01:32] about the blessings we were talking
[1:01:33] about his presence and singing and this
[1:01:35] we were having a good time and i was
[1:01:36] getting paid for it
[1:01:38] and and it was i mean well i was having
[1:01:40] a good time out there with this guy and
[1:01:41] then we kept on and on i finally i said
[1:01:43] and man and jesus is coming soon i can't
[1:01:45] wait for that new body that rapture is
[1:01:47] in here and he literally stopped in his
[1:01:49] place and looked at me and he said i
[1:01:51] could care less if jesus comes today or
[1:01:53] within 10 000 years from now
[1:01:57] and he wasn't saying that in a good way
[1:02:00] and i said what
[1:02:02] he said i'm just having a good time down
[1:02:04] here and everything else he said i don't
[1:02:06] really think that he's coming like right
[1:02:08] now right
[1:02:10] and i thought huh
[1:02:12] that's kind of enlightening
[1:02:14] and i guarantee you it's because there
[1:02:16] were things of this world he was
[1:02:17] enjoying more than really even the
[1:02:19] blessings of god right i could care less
[1:02:21] if it comes just leave me alone for a
[1:02:22] while
[1:02:24] because you see the thing had not been
[1:02:26] revealed to him
[1:02:28] but man you can get happy about a body
[1:02:29] change
[1:02:32] you'd be crazy not to right
[1:02:36] you young kids you might not be able to
[1:02:37] be you know as excited as those old
[1:02:39] folks are yet but let me tell you it's
[1:02:40] coming
[1:02:41] right it's coming
[1:02:43] time lasts you you understand one of
[1:02:45] these days
[1:02:46] amen come quickly lord jesus i hope it
[1:02:48] does not get to that point i'm ready to
[1:02:50] go home
[1:02:51] amen praise the lord but you see what i
[1:02:54] mean it's a it's a very scriptural thing
[1:02:56] here
[1:02:59] the scripture says also that talking
[1:03:02] about a breathing word a living word
[1:03:04] that the scripture says that that god
[1:03:06] breathed
[1:03:07] into adam
[1:03:09] the breath of life
[1:03:11] and he became a living soul
[1:03:14] i guess that's as in
[1:03:16] as compared to a dead soul
[1:03:19] but he became a living soul
[1:03:23] so so without that word that that word
[1:03:25] was spoke it was literally it was
[1:03:27] breathed into adam if you go back and
[1:03:29] you look in and that word breath there
[1:03:30] that breath of life was put into adam
[1:03:32] that word life i should say is the same
[1:03:34] word that is used for the tree of life
[1:03:36] it was the same thing god breathed
[1:03:38] that's he he put that same life that was
[1:03:40] literally in the tree of life it was in
[1:03:43] adam
[1:03:45] it was an ad it's the same life it
[1:03:46] wasn't a different life
[1:03:48] it was the same life
[1:03:50] and in fact adam brother branham said
[1:03:52] that adam was literally he was god on
[1:03:54] earth right he was a little messiah
[1:03:57] he was little m god or little sorry
[1:03:59] little g god he was a little in messiah
[1:04:02] he had control he could speak in in the
[1:04:04] natural world would obey him and all
[1:04:06] these things because he had that life on
[1:04:08] the inside of him god breathed that
[1:04:10] inside of him oh when god breathes his
[1:04:13] word inside of a believer it has to it
[1:04:17] has to bring things into subjection to
[1:04:19] it
[1:04:20] because it's not that believer it's god
[1:04:22] that's doing it through you
[1:04:26] adam or god sorry god breathed into adam
[1:04:31] god in jesus breathed upon his disciples
[1:04:33] he said receive ye the holy ghost
[1:04:37] what is the holy ghost
[1:04:40] it's the breath of god
[1:04:42] it's the spirit of god
[1:04:44] it's the life of god
[1:04:45] it's the force of god it's the
[1:04:47] quickening power upon the word
[1:04:49] hallelujah he breathed upon his
[1:04:52] disciples
[1:04:53] ye the holy ghost what does he do to you
[1:04:56] when you what is it he does to you when
[1:04:57] you read this word of god when you
[1:04:59] recognize that neither something comes
[1:05:00] up and there's just something begins to
[1:05:02] move and you say that's it amen i
[1:05:05] believe that there's just something
[1:05:06] moving there you know what he's doing
[1:05:07] god's breathing
[1:05:09] upon you
[1:05:12] brother brandon made the statement he
[1:05:14] said we we we have a baptism in the holy
[1:05:16] ghost he said it's baptism upon baptism
[1:05:19] upon baptism upon baptism right
[1:05:21] it's not a one-time deal he said
[1:05:24] praise the lord
[1:05:25] what is that that's god breathing
[1:05:28] upon this word
[1:05:29] he's breathing upon that thought he's
[1:05:32] breathing and breathing and breathing
[1:05:34] he's breathing life into his word to
[1:05:36] bring it to pass in your life
[1:05:39] oh i'm so thankful to be a son of god
[1:05:44] so you see what i mean
[1:05:47] god speaks in the third year of cyrus
[1:05:49] king of persia a thing was revealed unto
[1:05:50] daniel his name was called built a
[1:05:52] stager and the thing was true but the
[1:05:54] time was of
[1:05:55] sorry the time appointed was long it was
[1:05:58] going to be a long way out there
[1:06:00] but still he understood the thing and he
[1:06:02] had an understanding of the vision there
[1:06:04] and he said in those days i daniel was
[1:06:06] morning three four weeks i ain't no
[1:06:08] pleasant bread nor neither came flesh
[1:06:10] nor wine in my mouth neither did i
[1:06:12] anoint myself at all till three whole
[1:06:14] weeks were fulfilled this man had a need
[1:06:18] he was doing some serious crying wasn't
[1:06:20] he
[1:06:22] and here's the part that again i think i
[1:06:25] believe brother branham was talking
[1:06:26] about in the quote we read this morning
[1:06:28] to people has a lot of hindrances
[1:06:30] he was mourning three
[1:06:32] whole weeks
[1:06:36] he was he was fighting it for three
[1:06:38] whole weeks in his flesh
[1:06:41] you think well that looks like a
[1:06:42] hindrance don't it yes flesh-wise
[1:06:45] but the promise of god had to be
[1:06:49] the promise of god had to be the angel
[1:06:50] when he came to him the angel gabriel
[1:06:52] said he said i was i was i was hindered
[1:06:54] or i was was delayed
[1:06:56] by the prince of persia right
[1:06:59] who was the prince of persia at this
[1:07:00] time the babylon had already had already
[1:07:02] gone to the persians
[1:07:04] so persia the medo-persians were in or
[1:07:06] in power now
[1:07:08] so the prince of persia is the spirit
[1:07:10] the prince of the power of the air that
[1:07:11] was over that land brother branham said
[1:07:13] every nation has a spirit to it our
[1:07:15] nation has a spirit to it right
[1:07:17] it's not necessarily a good thing right
[1:07:19] so here the prince of persia daniel had
[1:07:22] been in babylon and into into persia now
[1:07:25] for 68 years he'd been living here under
[1:07:27] this spirit for all this time and the
[1:07:29] prince of persia was was was hindering
[1:07:32] him
[1:07:35] but it wasn't hindering faith
[1:07:38] well praise the lord
[1:07:39] how are you buddy
[1:07:41] god bless you brother wade
[1:07:43] see he lives
[1:07:45] praise the lord amen
[1:07:47] [Applause]
[1:07:50] from the prince of persia
[1:07:52] you shouldn't have put that new battery
[1:07:54] in there that prince of persia
[1:07:58] that prince of persia was withstanding
[1:08:00] him
[1:08:02] that prince of the power of the air he
[1:08:03] had to get through the atmosphere to get
[1:08:05] to a place to where he could get to that
[1:08:07] faith you see faith has no hindrances
[1:08:10] but but this thing out here has
[1:08:11] hindrances but when daniel could break
[1:08:13] through
[1:08:14] after three weeks of mourning of crying
[1:08:17] of fasting and and all these things
[1:08:19] after three weeks he was able to break
[1:08:21] through and get to that place of true
[1:08:23] faith
[1:08:25] and when true faith was when he when he
[1:08:26] hit that spot that spot of faith i love
[1:08:29] to say it like that that spot of faith
[1:08:31] when he gets down there to that place
[1:08:33] there then the angel shows up the angel
[1:08:35] gabriel he says oh god heard you from
[1:08:37] the very first time you set your heart
[1:08:40] to pray when you just turned your heart
[1:08:42] to god he heard you the very first time
[1:08:45] well what was he waiting for you had to
[1:08:47] come to the spot
[1:08:50] you had to come to the spot
[1:08:53] don't give up
[1:08:54] don't give in
[1:08:56] don't stop
[1:08:58] don't just say a prayer and lay your
[1:08:59] head upon your pillow
[1:09:01] don't just say a prayer and say oh well
[1:09:03] but you push until you get to that spot
[1:09:06] you say wait a minute i thought faith
[1:09:08] was was was unconscious it is when you
[1:09:10] get to that spot
[1:09:12] you see if i've been going fast enough
[1:09:14] i'd get all this this morning
[1:09:16] but it been but it is when you get to
[1:09:18] that spot it's unconscious when you get
[1:09:20] to that spot because that's the word of
[1:09:22] god that's been spoken now it's it's got
[1:09:24] to come to pass
[1:09:27] you say oh if i could just have faith
[1:09:28] you do got you do have faith you've just
[1:09:31] got to come to that place of faith
[1:09:37] brother brahms the people has lots of
[1:09:38] hindrances
[1:09:41] minds have lots of hindrances
[1:09:44] oh man how we know that
[1:09:47] it's a mind battle in it
[1:09:49] it's the greatest battle that's ever
[1:09:51] been fought
[1:09:54] i think that's a very this is a very
[1:09:56] common ailment to humanity here brother
[1:09:58] branham said people
[1:10:00] that means humanity all of it people
[1:10:02] have lots of
[1:10:04] hindrances here
[1:10:06] and those hindrances they they originate
[1:10:07] right here in our minds
[1:10:10] you can be ever so mean to me but your
[1:10:12] your meanness or rottenness or whatever
[1:10:14] it's really not what hinders me it's my
[1:10:16] attitude here towards you
[1:10:17] if i can love you even while you hate me
[1:10:19] amen it does not bother me one bit
[1:10:21] i say so many times people hold grudges
[1:10:23] and everything else they don't forgive
[1:10:25] they don't know the power forgiveness
[1:10:27] and all these things and it causes so
[1:10:29] many problems and and somebody could do
[1:10:31] you wrong and go on it your your grudge
[1:10:33] is not hurting them a bit
[1:10:36] it's not changed them a bit it's not
[1:10:38] doing anything to them all it's doing is
[1:10:40] holding you back
[1:10:42] right
[1:10:43] holding me back that's all it is we
[1:10:44] fight in our minds we wrestle on our
[1:10:46] minds we try to get past these flesh and
[1:10:48] blood bodies and all these things and
[1:10:49] what are we doing we're trying to reach
[1:10:51] that spot where true faith resides
[1:10:55] but the enemy does not want you to reach
[1:10:57] out and get a hold or find that spot
[1:11:00] because he knows
[1:11:02] the true faith
[1:11:04] knows no defeat
[1:11:06] it is truly unhindered
[1:11:09] no obstacle can stop it
[1:11:12] it can't even slow it down
[1:11:15] he's well man abraham abraham had 25
[1:11:18] years
[1:11:19] yeah but i tell you what
[1:11:21] when isaac came he came right on time
[1:11:24] he came right on time praise the lord
[1:11:29] it's always in god's appointed time
[1:11:31] god's never late
[1:11:34] he's never late
[1:11:35] they sent for jesus and said your friend
[1:11:37] lazarus lazarus is sick
[1:11:41] right
[1:11:42] so jesus what does he do he turns and
[1:11:44] goes two days further away because you
[1:11:46] see it wasn't time yet in god's timing
[1:11:48] it wasn't time yet
[1:11:51] and when they finally get there he said
[1:11:52] your friend lazarus you know he died
[1:11:54] he's sleeping he said he tells the
[1:11:55] disciples they think he means well he's
[1:11:57] just sleeping if he sleeps he's doing
[1:11:58] well right and jesus says no he's dead
[1:12:01] i love that he just nap he's he's dead
[1:12:04] you need to get that through your mind
[1:12:05] he's dead and they're like
[1:12:07] he said but for your sakes
[1:12:11] not for his
[1:12:12] but for your sakes i'm glad
[1:12:15] now let's go awaken
[1:12:17] oh my
[1:12:19] they want no fight they want no struggle
[1:12:21] there wasn't no they're just sitting
[1:12:23] there trying to fight no no jesus knew
[1:12:25] exactly what he's doing why because he
[1:12:27] was the son of god he knew exactly he
[1:12:29] was in that spot he was never out of
[1:12:31] that spot
[1:12:34] but when you can reach that spot too you
[1:12:36] can be just as sure of your faith being
[1:12:39] moving god as jesus did all the things
[1:12:42] that he did
[1:12:45] god's word cannot lie
[1:12:48] jesus does not show up late
[1:12:51] he's always right on time
[1:12:53] and the instant you touch the hem of the
[1:12:55] garment of jesus at that point of
[1:12:57] contact
[1:12:59] that spark of faith is there that moment
[1:13:02] you find that spot of faith
[1:13:05] satan is defeated
[1:13:09] satan is defeated this afternoon
[1:13:12] you can say it's over
[1:13:14] hallelujah it's over
[1:13:16] the battle's over the fight is over the
[1:13:19] struggle is over how many believe the
[1:13:21] war has already won
[1:13:23] hallelujah
[1:13:24] praise the lord the war has already won
[1:13:30] i was going to say but the battle's
[1:13:32] still going
[1:13:34] but the battles the battles in this
[1:13:36] right here it's not in that spot of
[1:13:38] faith and in that spot of faith he is
[1:13:40] defeated it is over and how
[1:13:43] encouraging that should be to all of us
[1:13:46] and make us strive that much harder to
[1:13:48] reach that spot
[1:13:51] hallelujah
[1:13:56] i'm cutting just as much out of this as
[1:13:58] i can guess you drop down this quote
[1:13:59] here i want a couple quotes i want to
[1:14:01] get to here brother branham said looking
[1:14:02] at the unseen i'm going to close right
[1:14:03] here in a minute
[1:14:05] he said oh
[1:14:07] this is looking at the unseen 1958 he
[1:14:10] said oh if the church of this day could
[1:14:12] ever pray
[1:14:13] until they till they pass the sin
[1:14:15] barrier and the unbelief barrier
[1:14:18] they can shout the victory of a living
[1:14:20] god when they once passed that barrier
[1:14:22] by looking to the unseen and letting the
[1:14:24] world vibrate and do what it wants to do
[1:14:27] oh just just let the world do what it
[1:14:29] wants to do
[1:14:33] but i'm in that spot with god
[1:14:35] shut in with god
[1:14:37] in that secret place
[1:14:39] there's a place of perfect rest behind
[1:14:42] that interval
[1:14:44] and that place is called faith
[1:14:46] true faith is unhindered
[1:14:48] he said oh she
[1:14:51] she had many hindrances
[1:14:54] it's a little bit further down the same
[1:14:55] message perseverance he said she had
[1:14:57] many hindrances she did herself
[1:14:59] but her faith didn't have any hindrances
[1:15:01] no faith don't have any hindrance faith
[1:15:03] just believes it i don't have a
[1:15:05] hindrance at all you're already past the
[1:15:08] sound barrier as the lady was talking
[1:15:10] over there faith don't have a hindrance
[1:15:13] you might have it but your faith doesn't
[1:15:16] have it your faith has no hindrances at
[1:15:19] all
[1:15:21] so in the midst of the struggle don't
[1:15:23] label that struggle as your faith don't
[1:15:24] say i don't have enough faith i don't
[1:15:26] have enough faith oh i've heard that so
[1:15:28] many times i've told myself that so many
[1:15:30] times i just don't have enough faith no

[1:15:34] you just push on to it
[1:15:38] brother wade you're healed right
[1:15:41] right
[1:15:42] brother dale you're healed why the faith
[1:15:45] is there it's not like we're waiting on
[1:15:47] god to come down and bring enough power
[1:15:49] to heal us it's already here oh people
[1:15:52] say oh if i could just get under if i
[1:15:54] could get to the blessings of god if i
[1:15:55] could if god would just bless me that's
[1:15:56] it if god would just bless me i want a
[1:15:58] blessing i want a blessing listen the
[1:16:00] only way you can find a blessing is to
[1:16:02] get into the presence of god because god
[1:16:04] is a he is the blessing it's always
[1:16:06] blessing where god is
[1:16:08] the problem is that people don't want to
[1:16:10] go to where god is
[1:16:11] i want to go where he's at i want the
[1:16:13] blessing i want that healing i want that
[1:16:15] faith in the get to that spot

[1:16:48] daniel said he lifted up his eyes and
[1:16:52] he saw
[1:16:54] all the saints down through the ages and
[1:16:56] through the bible stuff they
[1:16:58] they lifted up their eyes and they
[1:17:00] looked and they saw
[1:17:02] abraham lifted up his eyes and he saw
[1:17:07] isaac lifted up his eyes and he saw he
[1:17:09] saw that promise he saw rebecca coming
[1:17:13] jacob lifted up his eyes and he saw
[1:17:15] he saw the angels ascending and
[1:17:17] descending upon the ladder there
[1:17:21] daniel said in verse 5 of that same
[1:17:23] chapter we're reading verse 10 he said i
[1:17:25] lifted up my eyes and i looked
[1:17:27] what do you reckon he what eyes do you
[1:17:29] reckon he was looking with
[1:17:32] brother branham on the river there he he
[1:17:34] he saw he looked he lifted his eyes he
[1:17:36] saw the pillar of fire coming down
[1:17:40] some said they saw it others said they
[1:17:41] didn't see it
[1:17:44] some heard the voice speaking some
[1:17:45] didn't hear the voice speaking
[1:17:48] jesus cried out one time and said father
[1:17:50] glorify thy name and the voice came out
[1:17:53] of heaven and said i have i have both
[1:17:55] glorified it and i will glorify it again
[1:17:58] and some that were there said it
[1:17:59] thundered right
[1:18:04] you know what that why you know why that
[1:18:05] is that people say look the bible paul
[1:18:07] paul in describing his damascus road
[1:18:09] experience in one place he said that
[1:18:11] that the people that are with him heard
[1:18:12] it and saw another place that he said
[1:18:13] they didn't and people said see the
[1:18:15] bible contradicts itself it's just it's
[1:18:17] not right and brother branham said this
[1:18:19] here and that and everything else there
[1:18:21] you know what the difference is there
[1:18:22] were those there that had eyes that
[1:18:24] could see they were looking again i'm
[1:18:25] not going to get there but they were
[1:18:26] looking on through their eyes of their
[1:18:28] theophany and they could see
[1:18:30] they were seeing what he was seeing amen
[1:18:33] that's why some sitting in the in the in
[1:18:34] the in the roads there and they would
[1:18:36] brother branham would say oh you see
[1:18:37] that pillar of fire most didn't see it
[1:18:39] but some saw it
[1:18:41] why because they were looking through
[1:18:43] different sets of eyes some were looking
[1:18:45] through their carnal eyes trying to see
[1:18:47] it people say oh if i could just hear
[1:18:49] god speak god don't speak anymore i said
[1:18:51] god speaks all the time you're just not
[1:18:53] listening with the right ears
[1:18:56] god speaks continuously oh i can't hear
[1:18:58] them it's because you're trying to hear
[1:18:59] them through these natural things right
[1:19:01] here they're deaf dumb and no good amen
[1:19:04] but you start speaking or listen through
[1:19:06] the heart the ears are of the heart the
[1:19:08] heart the ears of your theophany
[1:19:10] you start listening through there and oh
[1:19:12] i guarantee you you hear god speaking
[1:19:15] and singing all the time the presence of
[1:19:17] god is always there
[1:19:19] he's here right now amen i can feel him
[1:19:22] hallelujah not just with this right here
[1:19:24] but there's eagle eyes there's eagle
[1:19:26] ears there's a presence that's there god
[1:19:28] is continuously that's the blessing of
[1:19:30] god
[1:19:33] he speaks what eyes do you think daniel
[1:19:35] saw through
[1:19:37] what eyes did abraham see through
[1:19:39] what eyes do you see through
[1:19:41] i lifted up my eyes and i looked
[1:19:44] lift up your eyes this afternoon church
[1:19:47] i don't know what your needs are but i
[1:19:49] know you got them
[1:19:51] i don't know what you're fighting with
[1:19:52] but i know that you're fighting
[1:19:54] if you're not fighting
[1:19:56] we probably need to carry you on to the
[1:19:58] corner
[1:20:00] you need to be down in the funeral home
[1:20:02] somewhere
[1:20:03] because if you're above the ground and
[1:20:04] you're still breathing you've got
[1:20:06] problems
[1:20:08] right you've got problems
[1:20:09] but the answer to every one of your
[1:20:11] problems
[1:20:12] it lays in jesus yes
[1:20:15] just get to where he's at
[1:20:17] faith knows no hindrance stand with me
[1:20:18] if you would this afternoon
[1:20:22] oh my
[1:20:26] i remember when brother jackie benton
[1:20:28] used to come through
[1:20:31] and then the service he would start
[1:20:32] singing that old thing faith in god will
[1:20:35] move a mighty mountain
[1:20:37] now i can't sing i'm not brother jackie
[1:20:39] brother jackie could really sing
[1:20:43] i love brother jackie i'll tell you what
[1:20:45] he would come and he would sing the same
[1:20:47] the beginning of the service he would
[1:20:48] sing the same verse the same song just
[1:20:50] over and over and over and over and the
[1:20:52] little kids are there like how many
[1:20:54] times are you going to sing that
[1:20:57] and i'd say he's going to sing it to the
[1:20:59] spirit of the lord comes down
[1:21:01] he's going to sing it until you can feel
[1:21:03] it
[1:21:04] right right
[1:21:05] why because he knew that if the presence
[1:21:07] of god at the presence of god if the
[1:21:09] people would get in a spot to where the
[1:21:10] presence of god could be be shed i think
[1:21:12] oh it was going to be a good time
[1:21:15] yeah i believe that same thing is true
[1:21:17] today amen right
[1:21:20] can you sing that faith in god and move
[1:21:21] to mighty mountain who's singing tonight

[1:23:04] i gotta tell you i experienced exactly
[1:23:06] what he
[1:23:07] said this past week i'm gonna try to
[1:23:10] condense it and you're gonna know every
[1:23:11] spot i hit on
[1:23:13] um
[1:23:14] i've been going
[1:23:16] for past four years i've had a rash
[1:23:18] on my body very itchy
[1:23:21] i've been to three dermatologists
[1:23:23] offices
[1:23:24] and it always came back bug bites i shut
[1:23:27] it down carnally
[1:23:29] because i'm like people live with me and
[1:23:31] i'm the only one getting bit by this bug
[1:23:34] shut it down brother dutch
[1:23:36] okay
[1:23:38] um
[1:23:39] i went to a skin cancer dermatologist on
[1:23:41] friday
[1:23:43] now i'm not sharing this testimony
[1:23:45] because i'm not going to give you all
[1:23:46] resolve
[1:23:48] that hallelujah resolve
[1:23:50] but the doctor said
[1:23:52] she read the reports because i brought
[1:23:53] the three all three of them said bug
[1:23:56] bites
[1:23:57] shut it down it didn't make sense
[1:24:00] so i went to the skin doctor cancer
[1:24:02] doctor
[1:24:03] she said has no one treated this and i
[1:24:07] said no
[1:24:08] and you know why brother dutch
[1:24:10] because i shut it down right i had to go
[1:24:13] to brother bob
[1:24:15] went
[1:24:16] boldly before the throne on thursday
[1:24:19] night
[1:24:20] and i said lord
[1:24:23] i gotta have an answer because i was
[1:24:25] getting close to the edge i'm gonna be
[1:24:26] real with y'all i was getting closer to
[1:24:27] the edge who itches 24 7 all day every
[1:24:31] day
[1:24:31] drawing blood
[1:24:33] and i went boldly bob on my knees on
[1:24:36] thursday night and i said lord
[1:24:39] i need an answer tomorrow
[1:24:40] i need an answer amen and don't you know
[1:24:43] i went to the skin clinic she made me
[1:24:45] feel good she rubbed my back she said
[1:24:46] we're gonna get you some relief
[1:24:48] okay so i went home brother done amen
[1:24:52] and the lord led me
[1:24:54] to those three reports that i never read
[1:24:57] and it uses the terminology and throb
[1:24:59] anthra was an animal it was bug bites
[1:25:02] but the doctor's delivery all three of
[1:25:04] them said bug bites that's why i shut it
[1:25:06] down i read for myself
[1:25:09] what it meant and he brought me back to
[1:25:12] the time
[1:25:14] and in the end and the question was why
[1:25:16] isn't anyone else getting bit by this
[1:25:18] bug
[1:25:20] it wasn't i wasn't the only one bit by
[1:25:22] the bug there was four other people
[1:25:26] but i'm the only one that's highly
[1:25:28] allergic to the flea
[1:25:31] i went boldly
[1:25:33] bob brother judge thank you my heart is
[1:25:36] about to have a heart attack he probably
[1:25:38] brought me from the heart that i sat
[1:25:39] there the whole time i'm like brother
[1:25:41] dutch you got to let me come up here i

[1:26:06] right he told me three times the same
[1:26:09] message
[1:26:11] that still small voice
[1:26:13] told me and i ignored it because i was
[1:26:15] carnal in my mind
[1:26:17] bug bites bug bites bug bites three
[1:26:19] times the lord told me and i shut it
[1:26:22] down until i went boldly
