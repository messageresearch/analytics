before we go to the to the scripture let's just carry the lord in prayer and remember all the ones that are gone this morning brother louise at brother burley's and brother dale and nanny and all the different ones that are sick and needy well god we're so grateful lord this morning for your word lord and we're so grateful that you sent a comforter lord god that you came yourself lord jesus to

as we look into your word this morning i pray god that you will help us to but just open up our hearts lord jesus that you anyone here lord has not fully opened their heart to receive your word that you would prick them lord god and keep after them lord god until they yield to you that's all of our desires this morning lord jesus is to not have not one left out with god but we might all be one great body working together to see your kingdom fulfill lord here in earth here in our earth we pray god that you'll minister to all the sick and the needy this morning and be with all the ones that need need a special touch from you this morning be with brother luis this morning as he ministers and brother dale and sister nanny sister peggy lord god is there going to the doctor this morning we pray ask these things in the name of the lord jesus christ amen so this morning i'm going to take kind of a strange little topic the proof that you took the vaccine that's kind of a strange topic in these and these times what what's the proof that you took the vaccine and and uh you know lately i've i've been taking a a message that brother brown preached and just really kind of meditating very deeply on every little jot and tittle that brother branham said so this morning i want to really kind of break down the message he cares do you care and just really see what brother branham was trying to convey in that message and one of the things one of the main points in that message is he kind of gets as he kind of gets into the the topic he begins to talk about taking the vaccine and how do you know if you actually took it or not and those kind of things so let's meditate on those things this morning as we read first peter chapter five verses one to eight and it's really interesting that peter is is talking in this scripture he's talking to the elders he said the elders which are among you i exhort who am also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of christ and also a peter a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed feed the flock of god which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly not for filthy lucr but of a reading mind neither is being lords over god's heritage but being in samples to the flock but to live a life in front of people so that you can influence them and when the chief shepherd shall appear ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away likewise younger submit yourselves unto the elder yea all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for god resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble now i got that in bold there because i think that is such a critical scripture because it's so easy to begin to get lifted up within yourself ministers laity people begin to get so puffed up within themselves and they until they re won't listen to correction god resisted the proud and giveth grace to the humble humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time because we want him to do the exalting not ourselves not for ourselves to be to put ourselves at the chief placed at the feast but to be invited to come and sit at the chief place now here's the here's the main point of this morning's message casting all your care upon him for he careth for you you may be seated the lord adds a blessing to the reading of the word now i want to kind of start this message this morning on with a with a very strange quote we're going to talk about martin luther king because brother branham started this message he cares do you care with with talking about why he believed that martin luther king was approaching things the wrong way and he said if we pull up that first quote he said no i was just talking about martin luther king on this great disaster that they're having in the south with the colored people i said if those people were slaves i'd take my church and go south to help them people out of slavery in other words he he does he wanted he would want to help people out of slavery now now just kind of set in your mind as i read these quotes the point that i'm trying to make is that the gospel is the power of salvation to change lives the gospel is the power of salvation to change lives and brother branham was looking at this situation of all of this conflict being stirred up and people rioting and things kind of similar to what's going on today and and he said he said it's inspired of the wrong thing you see they them people and that's the reason i say that not that there is any prophecy concerning it i have nothing on it from the lord and see this is that that that that sermon where he says it's just my opinion that he's going to lead them into a slaughter and all that kind of thing and if i say anything from the lord like that to tell you it's always i'm speaking now but when he speaks i say it's not me it's thus saith the lord and i can't say it until he tells me i could be altogether wrong in my thought about martin luther king i don't know i can say that's just my opinion anything that rises up trouble that's what's supposed to be in the last days now let me stop right here on that on that on what he just said about that's just my opinion because i was talking to somebody the other day and they were talking about how that a lot of things that brother branham says is his opinion well you know you got to be careful about that because you can think that he's saying something of himself and you'll you'll just kind of run off with you will ignore something that could help you something that's actually part of the word part of the word that he's trying to manifest through the preaching of the word so you have to wait you have to trust him to tell you whether or not he's his opinion or not if you just if you just cherry pick and say well i think that's his opinion you could be headed down the wrong path you've got to be very careful about that now now we believe that god sent a prophet and so we're relying on the the prophet's words i i was listening to that sermon that andrew glover preached here the last last night and and he was talking about how when he started preaching he thought that everybody if you just quote the prophet that everybody would agree with you and say yes and now they're head but it turns out that that's not true because a lot of people have trouble just opening up their heart they have a problem recognizing what's taking place in this day that this was not just a message from that a man came up with or or something like that this is this was a message straight from the throne of god straight to your heart straight from the deep the deep calling to the deep from god's soul to your soul if you could just recognize it that that when unless brother branham says that it's his opinion take it at face value and just hang on to it and meditate on it until god reveals to you the true nature of the thing he said i don't know i can't say that's just my opinion anything that rises up trouble that's what's supposed to be in the last days and it's all inspired of satan to break up our commonwealth and whatever we have anything that rises up like that so i'm for those people down there don't you never think that i'm not let me read that again i'm for those people down there don't you never think i'm not i'm for freedom and for everything but the people doesn't have that situation under now now now all of these kind of quotes and things that can be very confusing to somebody that's that's meditating and thinking about aligning themselves with the political arena of the day and and and just the the way that people in the world want you to think but but align your the reason why he called these things out is to align yourselves with the gospel and in the message the third exodus i had it on my phone but i guess i left it in my office so i wrote down also here so hopefully lord willing i could read my handwriting he said them people if they got a hard uh a hard heart he's talking about the people in the south yes i'm struggling reading my hand right they're all laughing if they got a hard heart and don't know these things you can't drive into a people's spiritual things what is beat in there with political powers they've got to accept it be born again then they'll see these things so the point that he's trying to make amongst all these comments is that you can't change the world by forcing people you can't change the world by by trying to beat them into letting you come into their schools into their programs you can't change the world but what you can do the the thing that will change the world is the gospel of jesus christ that born-again experience now now that's the thing that i i perceive that that many people let me be bold and say even here in this church struggle to understand the importance of being born again because being born again will actually change your heart it can change your heart to where a black man and a white man will love one another and can sit at the table and fellowship with one another it can change the heart to wear an old pharisee and a sadducee you can sit down with with somebody and one another and sit together in harmony and love it can change it can change your heart and see we're not trying to change our hearts by being good people we're not we're not trying to come to church to just be good and good citizens and everything but we're trying we're trying to we're trying to be born again because when the holy ghost comes and quickens the word that you've held it will change your life you see laodiceans are more concerned about their rights being infringed laodiceans are more concerned about their feelings being hurt or or what is in the constitution do you realize how many times the cost of the constitution has been amended uh been rewritten things taken out and put back in called amendments the constitution has been constantly changing since the founding fathers wrote it but i tell you one thing that hasn't changed is the word of god the word of god is eternal it's been it's been the same it's been unchanging it never changes nothing will ever be added nothing will ever be removed because it is consistent it is reliable if you can just let go and accept the word of god then you too can be part of that unchanging word but you see that's that's our problem brother brown said he said and now listen to this quote he said this united states he began to talk about how the government had was trying to make him make him pay all those overdue taxes and things that they said he owed he said this government now tells me that i can't even sign a check that's given to me personally see that's constitutional rights taken from me but what can i do about it just go ahead that's all now i wonder sitting here today let's meditate on this and and examine yourself how many of our lives and our thoughts is this quote contrary to because we think many times that we should get all riled up about somebody violating our constitutional rights or somebody forcing us to do something that we don't think we should be we should be able to do but he said just go ahead that's all see and it has to go through another system before i as a citizen of the united states can cash a check has to come through this church i can't cash it see and that's not right that's unconstitutional but what can i do about it there's nothing this tax collector down here is the one told me i couldn't do it so well there it is if it is whatever so just let it go now he's not saying something that they're trying to force him to do something contrary to the word you see but he's talking about the little little things like paying paying overdue taxes taking paying taxes that they want him to do forcing him to do things like that he's saying just let it go you see what real christian love real christian love is not riling up and getting all a temper tantrum and telling somebody well i've gotta you can't talk to me like that but real christian love is is wanting peace and wanting wanting to be in one accord with one another and and standing for something that's real and true not something that's fake you see the reason why brother brown kept hitting on the things that martin luther king was doing was because he was trying to rile up people for something through political force force something into being instead of trusting in the power of the gospel of the spoken word because the power the power there is power in the gospel there is power in the gospel but you got to believe it so as brother branham began to begin to talk about in this sermon he cares do you care he he began to talk about you know how much we are needy people and how you know even this morning sitting in this church there's many people that are needing different things everybody has a special need and some are needing salvation some are needing the new birth many realize that they need a new birth many don't realize they needed a new birth maybe this morning i couldn't maybe the veil from your eyes can be lifted up to realize to cause you if you don't realize that you need to be born again to open your eyes to the understanding that there's something wrong in your life and that you need god maybe this morning there's many people seeking healing and their their trouble in deflation i i know there are many people seeking healing a brother i was texting with a brother last night and he began to tell me all the ones that are suffering from from sickness from coronavirus all around and some are in the hospital and different kind of things and you see people are needy and god made us that way so that we would rely on god and not upon our own selves and so as brother branham was ministering this message he's trying to get a point across that god cares because you see you get so close to your sickness and to your job troubles into all these things and you begin to forget that you begin to think that god wants you to be uncomfortable and the message uh we were listening to in the car this morning i forget the title but it was one of these about god care he began to he began to preach about how that god does not want you to be uncomfortable and he began to relate how if a if a mother is is ministering to her a little sick child and rubbing his head and everything in the middle of the night she might be doing that sick herself and and that's how god is he's he's he's he doesn't want you to be sick he doesn't want you to be uncomfortable he wants you to be able to live a prosperous life so that you're so that you're whole in your body so that you can serve him with all of your faculties and many times we begin to realize we begin to get in our head that god wants me to be sick he wants me to suffer he wants me to go all these things suffering can can cause you to can build character and and suffering can can can help you as part of your journey but god doesn't want you to stay in a state of suffering many times suffering suffering the point of it is to bring you closer to god so that you realize that you need him but god doesn't want you to suffer and he doesn't want you to be sick so so don't wonder this morning if god still cares about you because he does care listen he cares for the old old people he cares for young people he cares for the young people that might be living in an old broken home where the mama's over here and daddy's over there and you don't know who your real daddy is or whatever but he still cares for you brother brown said he he cares if if you despite all of your failures and all the times that you've tried and failed he still cares for you you think about a god like that that despite all of your failings and all of your shortcomings and all the times that you messed up and all the times that you made a mistake but yet god is still on the scene and he still cares for you he still ca and you know what he's he sent his holy spirit into the church to prove that he cares that's why he's here this morning that's why the angels are lining the wall to show to you that he still cares that he wants you to just give in and open the door of your heart so that he can come in he said now brother branham when he was preaching this message he was preaching it in preparation for a prayer line so the people were already in expectation to come forward and go through the prayer line and receive what they were seeking now this morning in this church we're not we're not in preparation for a prayer line but yet you can still receive whatever you have need of if you will just follow the recipe that brother branham outlined as he was preaching this message you don't have to you can be like cornelius and just say lord just just speak the word you don't have to go through a prayer line you don't have to have somebody lay hands on you you can just well let me stay on track i was about to go off track here listen brother braham said you if you do not have faith then there's no need of even coming to be prayed for because it's going to take your faith and my faith together my faith to believe him your faith to believe him amen now now let's think about that now if god cares and you care that's lining up the word together that's lining up something in harmony if i believe and you believe i believe the word that i'm preaching and you believe the word that i'm preaching i believe it and i can back it up by scripture i believe and i'm showing you what the gospel says and you sit there and you believe and you we're now we're in harmony now something has got to happen if two or three agree concerning anything it's got to happen that is the scripture that is the word if i believe and you believe then something's got to happen if you get two people together and they believe on the word something's got to happen if you if you're but you've got to believe you've got to have faith how can you expect anything to happen without faith and so we're going to examine it in this message this morning what goes into having faith there's a recipe that brother branham outlines exactly what you need to do to have to so that your heart can soften up exactly your approach to the what to the gospel your approach to the word so that you can look at it with the right frame of mind so that something will spark and something will happen he said so we don't forget this now as uh go along we've got to have something evidently with evidence i mean that we can base our faith upon what we're trying to do because if a man approaches anything that he wants to do without sufficient faith he's bound to be a failure but if he can approach it with sufficient faith then he's bound to succeed if it is according to god's will and purpose to do it now think about a promise like that that if you come with faith it is bound to succeed you are bound to succeed you are bound to succeed just like that little woman that said if i can but touch the hem of his garment that i will be made whole and she came with the right approach the right sincerity the the right the right everything and she believed the word because matthew chapter 9 verse 20 says and behold a woman which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years came behind him and touched the hem of his garment for she said within herself if i may but touch his garment i may i shall behold now she doesn't come with books and books of theology and all this kind of stuff she didn't come with a minister drag behind her but she came with her own pure simple faith believing that if she could just reach out and touch the hem of his garment she will be made whole you know that's how you approach god for every promise of god written in his word whether it's the holy ghost whether it's healing whether it's the salvation of your children you approach god with that same simple faith that that little woman reached out and touched the hem of his garment if i can just touch the hem of his garment that's all she said she didn't say if i can have a big long conversation with him if i can get all worked in a motion but if i can just touch the hem of his garment so you see that's our problem we begin to say it's not for me it won't work it won't work it's not effective me and zach were talking about one of his friends in the message the other day about how that's exactly the words that he would relate i've tried it and it won't work i keep trying to be delivered and it won't work i go back and it's like i go around in circles but i wonder i want to ask you this morning if you're going around and around in circles and it doesn't seem to be effective have you accepted it the way that brother branham said to accept it have you received the prescription have you taken the vaccination the way that it's supposed to be taken have you believed it with all of your heart have you received it with a with the open door you see this mess this medicine is not to be haphazardly chugged with a glass of water like some some appeal that you got in your cabinet this medicine is to be taken with sincerity with an honest and a contrite heart coming into church not laughing and joking all those kind of things but this medicine has got to be received the right way first you've got to believe that he cares listen brother branham he began to expound all these different these different stories of how that to show that god cares now see see right now right now i'm preaching about how much god cares and if you're asleep in this church i wonder how much you care i wonder if your eyes are beginning to slumber i i wonder if the gospel could wake you up right now to the revelation that god cares for you that god cares whether or not you care or not god still cares for you even if you don't care god still cares god cares enough to die for you on the cross even if you're slumbering even if you're asleep even if you look with half eyes that you don't care right now god still cares for you brother brown said he he said he was talking about this this minister a leader that had been bound by a complex and he said he went there and seen this handsome young man sitting there just in the peak of his life a leader of young men sitting there and sitting bound him he said he never noticed but i took my hand to shake hands with his hand to see if some disease had plagued him but there was no sign of vibration coming right out of the room from praying and fasting and waiting upon the lord the anointing of the holy spirit was there and that's why i let us see and then seeing the shadow of darkness over him i never said what i was doing but in less than a couple of moments time it was all gone the coldness of his hands left he was shouting and praising god a few minutes to find himself and here they sit here right this morning sitting sitting in the audience see how satan was trying to upset that young man by referring to him of some complex to be built back which the holy spirit knew but god cared for that man god cared for that young boy do you real i wonder how many of us sitting here in this audience this morning would care for a minister that had been backslidden would care for somebody that's supposed to be a leader that had gotten way late and uh tossed to the side and the devil had got all trapped up but you see even when we don't care for somebody god still cares that's how much god still loves us even when we're unlovable god still loves us brother brown began to talk about this sister that had been searching for deliverance for nine years and then when she finally met somebody that could tell her the truth she realized that god still cared for her and she said brother bran i'm just a word with you standing there a vision broke over this fine looking young woman and see that her heart was burdened and she was trying to work to make a living and a great thing happened way back in the time of her parents that had caused this great thing to happen to her and the lord jesus revealed it and showed what it was and there in a moment's time took it from the woman she went around rejoicing and now sitting here in the audience with us now rejoicing with tears as she's wiping her eyes now knowing that the truth of the thing was made known do you realize why she was delivered she began to get a an understanding that god cared about her that life was not some meaningless existence that you walk through and just go from your birth to your death and there's no purpose in life but god has a purpose for you god wants you to be happy god wants you to be comfortable god wants you to be healthy and wealthy and what well maybe not wealthy but god wants you to be god wants you to be what he his plan for you is you see when he was when he was on earth he cared for the people so much to until he healed their sick he comforted their hearts he told them about a place where he would go and prepare for them and would come again to receive them unto him himself and when he left he said i'll not leave you comfortless but i will send the holy spirit and he shall continue my care for you until he returns i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you he said his body brother brahms he explained it like this he said his body as a high priest and a mediatorial work that he's doing now that body must be in the presence of god at all times for intercession that god cannot see the sinner's sin he sees only the blood of his own son when you recognize that when you accept that you are taking the vaccine and the vaccination gives you a comfort to know that god is not looking at your mistakes when you come to god and ask for forgiveness and confess your sins god no more sees your mistakes and your problems in your iniquity but it's under the into the sea of god's forgiveless it's under the blood and he's looking at your mistakes and your sins through that shed blood i what what kind of a comfort that should give to the church this morning to know that god is not looking at your mistakes in your faults and failures but he's looking at you through the sacrifice the atoning blood that he already made he's looking at you through what he's already done and not what you are doing you see he cared on earth as he healed people and all those things but he sent his spirit back into the church to continue that care he was to continue to care for the people his people here on earth in the same manner that he cared for them when he was here because john 15 says when the comforter has come who i will send unto you from the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me and brother brown said in other words he will do the same thing he did the holy spirit working through a tabernacle that he had sanctified would do the same thing he did you talk about a comfort now now this should elevate our faith because if he healed the sick when he was on earth at that same comforter as in you you can trust that same comforter for that same healing that he gave back then if you need the holy ghost that same comforter is here right now to give it to you if you you don't have to wait it's not some far-off thing that we push we push way off in the future it's here ready right now for you to receive it in the building waiting on you standing by now what that ought to do for us then we know that right among us today we have the same comforting lord jesus in the form of the holy ghost another office that god himself was working in he was a comforter when they could look up and see the pillar of fire and hear the prophets speak the words that was true and vindicated do you know what vindicate means it means when the words are spoken and god brings it to pass when when god said when moses said we're going out god proved it that they by part of the red sea when when god told moses what i'm going to provide for you he proved it he vindicated it by providing for them he gave them water from the rock he gave them food he gave them man in the wilderness he took care of them he pre-vindicated it by proving that he was with him and he's proving that he's with you in this hour right now he's proving that he's here by the holy ghost he was a comforter when he's here on earth as a man god made flesh you promise the works that i do shall you do also and i am going to the father and going to send back the holy spirit which will be in me in spirit form and i'll be with you and dwell in you and the very same things that i've done here the holy spirit will do again in my name when he comes and that's why i believe that signs and wonders will follow them that believe because the comforter is still here he hasn't left us high and dry he still cares for us he still cares for his church brother brown said how would you know because we see god manifested in flesh how do you know that you've took the vaccination how do you know that you've accepted the word for your day how do you know that you're in a church a holy ghost field church that has accepted the vast vaccination because you can see god manifested in flesh brother brown said he would do it in the same way he would do it in the same way so that we would know so that we would know whether it was a comfort from some earthly standpoint is the comfort you have because somebody some somebody gave you some some sweet tea and invited you over for some biscuits in the morning or whatever invited you over for some steak in the evening or whatever is it that could that's not the kind of comfort that we have now listen i'm saying the same words i'm actually reading the quote from brother branham so don't get all tired and half-eyed on me now these are the these are the words of the prophet i wish i could run around and ride a unicycle or something if it will keep your keep you awake do some juggling or something you know just you know brother brown said that christians are entertained by the word we want we want some many times we want to come to church to see the minister entertain us and run around and do tricks and everything but a real christian is entertained by the word i i told you i wasn't going to do that brother by the way but i did it hey brother brown said he would do it in the same way so that we would know so that we would have confidence whether it was a comfort from some earthly standpoint whether we know it was a comfort from some elderly person how about that some elderly person who could put their arms around us and hug us a little and make us feel good or some theological term of a denomination that would say now you belong to us and we got it i don't belong to the rest of them because they haven't he made this directly sure see he will speak in my name the works that i do will you do also when he's upon you he would comfort in the same way by forgiving all of our sins by healing all of our sickness and speaking to us of a comfort of a kingdom that is to come in first timothy 3 16 it's written this way know about god without controversy we realize that great is the mystery of godliness for god was manifested in the flesh we saw god in flesh we see we are seeing god in flesh that was god's comfort to know that he comes so much he cared for us until he became one of us god manifested in the flesh not just another person but god himself now brother branham said in in all the different sermons that i've i've listened to along this line he said now he you know you think brother brown's not preaching from notes but he followed the same pattern and these sermons that's a comfort to me because you know a lot of times people say why are you preaching from notes bro well brother brown brother branham followed this pattern as he was preaching these things and he said now everybody doesn't have this comforter and he said so the reason they don't have it is because they don't accept it it's for them but they don't accept do you realize when you get a correct understanding of predestination that god is not pushing you through a tube that's that's the way so many of us used to believe back in the day and may i hope i hope you don't believe that now that it hinders our ability to witness when you say well if they're going to come to it they're just going to come to it somewhere along the line some something's going to happen it hinders your ability to respond correctly to the gospel if you don't understand predestination correctly god predestinates you by for knowledge no he's looking right now at your choice he looked before the foundation of the world what your choice would be how you would respond whether you would accept it or not and so he had it waiting for you if he knew that you would accept it do you real we were talking about that the other day in our home do you realize that the the the grace that god has given that he looked down from from eons eons back and knew that you would accept it and therefore could bring this one to the and this one together all the way down this one mayor and this and we're we were talking about zach has romanian ancestors and you think about all those wars and things vlad sheppas the the military leader that inspired count dracula everything that would put people on stakes and all those you could look across the hillside and see people just on skewered on stakes because of when he won a war everybody got skewered hundreds of thousands of people and think about all those wars that god brought a line right through because he knew that one day zach would be sitting in this church and i'm not just speaking on zach because he's my on my son i'm speaking on everybody everybody here that would believe the gospel god knew before the foundation of the world that you would accept it and he made a way for you to accept it because he knew that you would accept it he knew you would receive it you talk about grace you talk about a comfort to be able to recognize how much god cared for you that he died on the cross for you and made a way for you and sent a prophet for you and vindicated it and showed the sign in heaven all these things so that you would you would have you would be confident and you would know that god cared for you brother braham said if you don't accept god's comforter you have to find some other comforter because you can't live without something to live for man one message brother brown was talking about you see the problem is that you got a little spot in your heart that's got to be filled right and it was filled in in the garden of eden it was filled by god and then aft when sin entered the picture from from abel on down to john the baptist it was empty because they were looking and waiting for something they were waiting for something to feel that thing and you see down through the ages if you don't feel that thing with god you'll have to feel it with something and brother branham said i wrote down some things that he said that people feel it with he said people will think that their their children they'll they'll think that they want their children to go to a nice ballet program or something they'll because the parents want their kids to be in ballet or something or baseball or whatever it might be get them in some kind of program and that detract takes them away from the word of god and get them in the ballet or something that that gets he said what it is is putting strict nine in them strict nine in them to fill that thing that spot in their heart with something else he said there was this lady in the service one of his services that she said talking about recognizing that god cares he said she was sitting back there and and her baby began to cry and she wasn't even a believer but he she took that baby out of the out of the congregation and and he said he said after the service he was walking by and she said i wish i could have heard the rest of that service i wish i could have heard it and he said he said well hey this is the providence of god and began to talk to her about the lord and before long she was crying and weeping and he said he said you realize what what took place was that woman cared she wanted somebody else to be able to listen to that service and she didn't want to hinder the service by that baby crying and she cared enough to take that baby out and because she cared god cared for her you see if you if you don't if you don't feel that spot up something else will feel it but you see there is a present tense thirst quencher now brother brown said now we find out that the churches too are they're always promising something always looking for something far off he said like like television and so forth and i believe what he's saying there is he's a lot of these television programs well like the news a lot of times this we're going to be we're going to be talking about something in this news program and they keep putting it off and putting it off until you've done watched a whole hour waiting for this little five minute thing that they're gonna be showing they keep putting something off putting something off and he said that they never get to the thing that they promised as i often said an old quotation man is always praising god for what he did praising god for what he will do looking forward to what he will do and then ignore what he's doing and that's the way they become history after a while the polluted sea because they fail to recognize now you can talk of the comfort christ give once and say that a comfort he get will give in the ages to come but refuse the comfort that he's got here for you now he's got it for you here now now let's pull up this next quote um that starts with even to our confessions because this is this is a i think this is a very special quote this is a quote that brother branham while he was preaching said listen to this quote now that's a very strange thing to say while you're preaching now let's read it he said even to our confessions now i want you people that are coming or on the tape i want you to listen close now for a moment to this quotation i'm saying it real slow so they can pull it up in the back it should be paragraph 61. that's not it that's not it either thank you even to our confessions now i want you people that are coming or here and hold or on the tape i want you to listen close now for a moment to this quotation but all right there we go excellent now listen listen close because he's going to tell you the recipe he's going to outline it for you and then we're going to go through this quote with painstaking deliberation he said unless you are deeply sincere and you cannot be sincere until you're positive understand if you're presuming or guessing or hoping so then there cannot be a depth of sincerity that god requires it faith is not a hope so or it could be right it's got to be absolutely amen it's your ultimate it's your absolute it's the thing that you're tied to see you have come to your ultimate that it is the truth and there's it's nothing but the truth and it must be thus and then when you realize that in your mind then you've got to approach it with your whole life soul body all that's in you just completely sell out everything to it jesus so graciously taught us in the in the um in the man buying pearls and he found the one of great price and he sold all his others to get to it all the truths and everything that he had thought they were good pearls this one meant all to him and when you find god's ultimate his word a promise upon a certain thing you must know first that it is god's word that the thing that you're seeing being done is god there's no maybe so it could be it looks like it might be it is god then when you get to that spot then that's the pearl of great price you must get away from anything that anybody else tells you contrary to it you must not look to what man has achieved you must look to what god has said and what he promised and see him to do it then that's your ultimate right there and then everything that you are everything that you was everything that you hope to be must be placed upon this just as though it was death and life to you at that moment now let's go to the next slide excuse me now now think about this what he's saying is that god cares but the question is do you care and he's telling you how to recognize whether or not you care or not do you care because until you care the word cannot become activated in your life it can cannot become manifested in your life and you know i i wonder today today this is the hour when we should be caring more than ever you can look around and see the things that have come upon the earth and this is the hour when we should be getting really serious so brother adam said unless you are deeply sincere now sincerity brother brahm said that's what the angel told me in praying said if you'll be sincere and will get the people to believe you and nothing shall stand before your prayer sincerity is what at each stage of his ministry as he was advancing on and going higher and higher the angel would come to him and tell him be more sincere and the message paradox just then the serpent turned to me when i said and looked at me again and a voice came for me when he saw that vision of the serpent and said you've been given power to bind him the worst or any and i said well god what must i do he said there's one thing you must do you must be more sincere you must be more sincere so if we must be more sincere we've got to find out how to be sincere what is sincerity sincerity is free from pretense or deceit proceeding from genuine feelings sincerity is just being honest with yourself and and expressing that in a genuine way you're there's nothing there's nothing you're expressing the true what you truly are what you are is what you should be like i've always said just be if you're a sinner just be a genuine sinner and then when god fills you with the holy ghost then you'll there will be a genuine transformation sincerity is being sober understanding comprehending faith really coming to it with with a sober mind understanding that it's not something to just laugh about and and we're not coming just just just making fun and we're coming with sincerity because you know really the house of god is a place to die and that's a like a funeral home is a very sincere place because somebody's laying in the casket and what happens in church is people are coming to die to themselves die out to the things of this world and become near receive the newness of life in christ and brother said what if i said now i'm going to confess it that i done wrong if if he did something wrong with his wife or whatever he said i said good lord o friend of mine you know that i know you real well praise god hallelujah i think you're a good old fellow if he was to come to god like that would that be sincerity would that be an honest confession out of a sincere heart that's not sincerity and he said i think one of the things that keeps our people from being healed is the lack of confession is the lack of sincere confession the lack of sincere confession to confess where you are that god i'm wrong i've done things wrong and to confess with a sincere heart what you believe the word the promise of god to be to come sincerely god knows what kind of a person you are and what your problems are and those kind of things just come to him sincerely and meet him sincerely and something will happen and the next thing is to recognize that he cares if we could just recognize that god is on the scene right now that he's mindful of you and your situation that he wants to fill you with the holy ghost brother brahm said he wants to give you the holy ghost more than you want it he wants to give you the holy ghost so might be but he can't override your free moral agency and he's waiting on you to accept it he's waiting on you to be sincere to receive it with a sincere heart he wants you to be healed how about that we've been thinking about the holy ghost and and and kind of looking around maybe at others but what about your healing if there's something wrong in your body something in your body that needs to be healed god is standing by to give you that healing if you can just accept it with a sincere heart he doesn't want you to suffer he wants the best for you and brother brown said you have to approach it with all that's in you and i think that is the definition of caring if you look about around at others and see somebody like david said in psalms chapter 69 for the zeal of thine house that house hath eaten me up you see somebody that's zealous for the lord that they've given everything for the lord that that's somebody that really cares about the things of god in matthew chapter 11 it says from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and the violence take it by force you know if you want something from god sometimes you have to take it by force you have to get serious with god you have to become zealous and a zealous caring person is not going to be sitting at home when the doors are open they're going to care about the word of god because their appetite has changed when when when you really begin to care about god you know from where your help comes from and so you will you will seek that come what may you'll be like jacob we're ready to just just almost be a little shyster to get to get a blessing from god ready to do whatever it takes in mark chapter 12 verse 29 to 30 and jesus answered him the first of all the commandments is hear o israel the lord our god is one lord and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment now it doesn't say to love the lord thy god without with part of your heart a part of your soul a part of your mind but to give yourself completely over to god completely to him that means that means not being a good christian at church when the doors are open and going home and going back into the filth of this world and doing things in secret but that means giving yourself holy over to god and if you're not doing those things if you haven't given yourself completely over to god then it's time to come with sincerity with a sincere heart and make an honest confession to god and see what happens see what happens if you'll follow this prescription and i i don't mean to tire you and bore you with these things this is the prescription that god gave us to follow if we'll just follow this prescription that we have a promise that god will prove to us that we have taken the vaccine do you have the proof that you've taken the vaccine he said know that the ultimate is god's word in galatians chapter 1 verse 6 to 11 i marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of god of christ unto another gospel he said but thou we though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed in other words to know to know that the gospel is your ultimate in other words to say it another way our own ideas are not the authority what your friend says to you is not the authority well what different preachers in the message say is not the authority if it deviates from the word the word of god is the ultimate authority and if you follow the word of god and receive it with sincerity with an honest and a contrite heart it will manifest what it says it will prove to you it will be the interpretation of the word it will be the proof that you have taken the vaccine he said look to what god has said and he has promised and that is your ultimate in revelation chapter 22 it says if any man shall add unto these things god shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book why because the word of god is our ultimate and then brother branham goes on to say know that what you're seeing being done is god if you can recognize god's presence if you can recognize that when a minister is up behind the pulpit and and saying what agrees with the word and recognize god's pro god's presence something will happen in luke chapter 24 verse 30 they were they were they were on the road to emmaus they went behind the closed door and they hadn't recognized him until he did something in their midst and it says and then their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight when your eyes become open to the presence of god something's bound to happen now i remember years ago i was in a little meeting it was just a little small country church and and the service seemed so dry and maybe like well it just seemed you know a lot of people were real sleepy that was i think there was somebody on the front row that had fallen asleep and and just looking around my this is uh this seems like an old tired church but right in the midst of that service a little a young man in the back of the church his eyes became open to the presence of god that god cared and even right there in the midst of that what seemed like an old tired assembly that young man i i watched i i remember being astounded at how god can move a god if god can touch your heart it don't matter if the whole rest of the assembly is falling asleep or whatever that young man came up to the altar and he began to cry out to god right in the middle of the service because his eyes came open and he began to realize that god cared for him and so he responded by caring for god you see it doesn't matter what we look so many times everybody else in the circumstances everything but if god can just touch your heart if you'll respond and be receptive to his calling something will happen remember the the story in the first kings of elijah sitting there and he heard all the earthquake and all the fire and all those kind of things but but what got him what caused him to recognize the presence of god was that still small voice speaking to his heart if you'll just hear that still small voice listen people might be running and jumping around you or they might not be people might be sitting there with half eyes and falling asleep but if you'll just recognize that that's that still small voice speaking to you god can move to you and god can do something to you and then brother branham said confess everything that they have did if you'll confess everything that you've done now listen he's preparing he's preparing the people to receive what they have need of before they come into the prayer line he's giving them a recipe to receive what they have need of so that they can receive healing of the baptism of the holy ghost and he said i believe that a man or woman coming to be prayed for should first confess everything that they have did and make everything right because you see you notice lots of times on the platform you notice watch how far away that thus saith the lord is let's pause and meditate on that quote for a second how far away thus saith the lord is now he said people's faith can bring a vision if they come through the prayer line and the vision will show them what their street number is the vision will show them what where they were born or what their name is the vision will show them all those kind of things but he says look how far away thus saith the lord is now you think as many people would walk through the prayer line go back and listen how many times he would tell them thus saith the lord you are healed thus saith the lord you have received now many times they would come through and he said go on your way believing and you'll receive what you ask go on your way but how many times did he say thus saith lord how far away is that thus saith the lord now brother branham's not here with us now but yet you can still have the confidence of a revelation that jesus christ gives to you personally where you know despite what the doctor tells you despite what people with all the naysayers around the world despite what anybody tells you you can have that same confidence in your heart today that somebody going through that prayer line god one brother abraham said thus saith the lord i believe you could still have that same confidence and how do you get that same confidence wake up for a little bit it's by following the recipe follow the recipe confess everything that you've done come sincerity with an honest and a contrite heart come believing accepting recognizing that that's that's not just a man behind the pulpit but when he reads the quotes from the prophet when he when he says what brother brahma said when he says what the bible says recognize that god is in the house god is in the midst and that he cares for you and then you will respond with caring yourself if you you see the problem is your heart it's not your head and your head you can receive all this knowledge but if your heart begins to respond with caring when you begin to care back something will happen but abraham said unless the world repents it's got to percy and confession is what the world needs today is honest confession i remember and now i'm not trying to be mean or anything but one time i i was preaching on repentance and i just got to preaching on repentance a lot and after a service somebody came up to me and said you preach on repentance too much i wish you would preach on something else but you know what i believe that's what the church needs i believe the church needs to repent i believe the church needs to confess i believe maybe that's what we need more than ever is to get serious serious enough with god to where we find out whether we have taken the vaccine or not because i believe i perceive that many have not taken the vaccine that's been prescribed to us we've read what's on the bottle we've read the bible we've got the letter on the page but we haven't received it the way that it's been prescribed to us and then he said get away from anything anybody tells you contrary get away from anything anybody tells you contrary in amos chapter 3 it says can two walk together he said they be agreed blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly not listening to all your all your negative friends all your unbelieving friends that tell you the all the all the many things that they think are wrong with the message that they think are wrong with the bible get away from all that negativity and get yourself centered get your head stuck in the holy of holies get so far into the holy of holies until all you can hear is the cherubim's wings all you can hear is the beating of the wings of god as he ministers to you and proves his word to you get so far away from all the commotion of the world until you're not you're not afraid of the coronavirus you're not afraid of the things that are falling on the earth get so far in there until you know whether whether or not you have taken the vaccine or not like that like that eagle in the barnyard story brother brown told you know how the eagle began to recognize that he wasn't a chicken when you recognize that you're not a chicken you don't want to be with the chickens anymore you don't want to be with the chickens you want to be with the eagles and that's why he got he hopped up on the fence post and began to listen to that voice screaming down from from up on high because he realized there was something different about himself there was something you know what what was different was that god knew from before that foundation of the world that that eagle would care when that mama eagle went over that chicken barnyard that eagle that mama eagle was caring for that little eagle down in the barnyard the eagle in the barnyard cared he cared enough to listen he cared enough to get out of that chicken yard and then brother brown said and then everything that you are everything that you was everything that you hope to be everything about yourself must be placed upon this just as though it was death and life to you at that moment because it is you know many times we talked about how we don't hang one and hang people over the hell fire like like some denominations and that kind of thing but i wonder if it's time to get a little bit serious you know brother brown said in one place he said if the if you could look if the door at the door at the floor just were to open up and you could gaze down into hell you would see the people in hell climbing over one another trying to get another chance to hear the gospel trying to get another chance to receive the gospel and you are still alive there's breath in your body and you still have a chance to receive this gospel don't be don't give up this chance that you've got because they wish that they could have another chance they wish that they could have one more opportunity to sit in a service like you do i wonder maybe if we could just just just kind of express to you the danger that so many souls are in in this a this hour to not realize how much god cares for you to turn that down my see he cares but do you care do you care enough to follow the prescription to the letter do you care enough to take the medicine yeah you see i realize i believe that this message he cares do you care is really a doctor examination where brother brown it's like you come into the doctor's office and you're listening to the sermon and you're you're laying on the table or sitting there on the table with the paper on it and you're letting the doctor look at you and and and and examine you and the doctor says the doctor's looking at you and you say well i still got pain i still got pain in my leg i still got i still got all these symptoms of sin and the doctor will look at you dr brother branham as you're listening to the message the doctor is looking at you and saying well did you take the medicine did you take the medicine because if you took the medicine there's a promise with the medicine that if you take the medicine that it will be manifested in your life if you take the medicine you will get the holy ghost if you take it in the right way you will get the holy ghost and it's not something like we were talking about these young people that will say well who knows how long it's going to take me to get the new birth it might be five years from now who knew i i think it's time to get serious about getting the new birth because you don't know what tomorrow holds talking saying things about well i don't even know the the the rapture might not come until until where all all my parents are dead and gone why would you even say something like that do you know the scripture says that they would say he delayeth his coming he's putting it off but his coming his coming is right now his coming is right now because it's coming as the revealing of his word if his coming is the revealing of his word i wonder if you could be missing his coming right now i wonder if you could be missing the rapture right now and not realize it so as we examine you get up on the doctor's table we examine you and look you over have you taken the doctor's medicine have you taken the medicine brother brown said but and then how we say but we took it but we took it we we've been to church we read the label and we think that's taken and he said and if you say you took it and the patience shows no results he didn't take it in this message he said he that heareth my word for instance he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has eternal life or king james puts it but everlasting which is eternal has eternal life because he's believed many people say they believe now that is true the scripture is correct i'm reading the prescription i'm reading what the prescription is and the antidote for my sin but can i take it can i believe i might say i believe but do i believe that's the next thing just read it and know the directions doesn't cure the disease the trouble is that in our case we won't take what the remedy says do we got the remedy but we won't take it we say we do because we can read it but to really take it we don't do it i i hope this is really sinking in and it's not putting anybody to sleep wake up just for a little bit longer we're almost we're almost over see the gospel is the same way a medicine in this case if the patient and the remedy has been proven to cure the patient and the patient reads all about the discovery of this drug and they know every ounce of medicine that's in it they know all the scientists name that found this certain drug like the saw do you realize what he's saying there's a mess we know there's a message we know that god sent a prophet we know all these people that preach before we know all the big names we know all these things if we know all the word about it but refuse to take it it won't help us so as we examine ourselves this morning let's see what the proof is that you have taken the vaccine has your appetite changed when you take this vaccine you will not be hungry and thirsting for the things of this world you your appetite will be for the word of god like that dream that zach had where he was sitting at the table and all he just kept eating and eating and eating and eating and he never got full because he was hungry he was hungry for the word and that's what that's the effect of taking the vaccine when you're like when you begin to get ambivalent and uncaring about coming to church well i just don't care i don't care about if you say i don't care about listening to the sermons if you say i don't care about getting into my bible i wonder if you have taken the vaccine i wonder if you care enough about getting in the word i wonder if you care enough that jesus cares have your desires changed has god changed your desires from the things of this world can you look back through your life and see that once you were like this but now you're like this once you were maybe desire to smoke cigarettes and desire to do all those things all the things of the flesh i know what what we believe about the flesh and all that kind of thing listen have your desires changed examine yourself to see if you're in a different spot now than you were years ago has something has a change been wrought in you because if you've taken the vaccine you're not going to be in the same place that you were years ago and the main thing have your eyes been open when you come to church and you don't understand the things that are being preached you don't you read your bible and you don't understand have you taken the vaccine have you received it according to the prescription have you received the vaccine have your eyes been open have your eyes been opened to understanding is your character changing all these tempers and impatience and all that that kind of stuff should be falling away as the word is being revealed in you after a while you shouldn't see a temper anymore after a while you should see that temper that impatience beginning to fade away after a while you should see the love of god being manifested in your life and not being all angry because you know if you care if you really care about god you'll care about your brothers you care about your sisters the real love of god being made manifest in you i'm trying to wind up here bc you got to be born again you must be born again and to be born again you've got to care you've got to if you come to church and you're uh well that preacher's just going to preach another tired so you know you know the reason it's a tired old tired old sermon a lot of times it's because you don't care it's because you know somebody that comes like that that story i was telling you a little a little brother in the back of that it seemed like an old tired church but he cared and that church service was not old dried up to him it didn't matter if people were running all the aisles or not but that church service meant something to him because he was dying out to his old self and something was something is being quickened in him if you'll if you'll begin to care it won't be old dried up service anymore brother brown says it and he cares do you care he said you take a person says that they are i am a believer i believe let the gospel light strike them brother they'll take it right now if you say you're a believer when the word is preached you'll take it you'll receive it and they'll show results that's the proof that you've taken the vaccine is when you see results signs and wonders will follow them that believe they shall cast out devils in my name that they shall take up deadly serpents they shall dream deadly things they shall do all these things why because they've taken the vaccine they've been vaccinated against the things of this world i believe in a vaccine this morning and brother braham called it a toxin he said i believe a toxic if you've got this toxin the vaccination in you it will it will protect you from all of the elements of the world all of the things that the devil throws you and and the more of this toxin this vaccination that you receive the more protected you are the more protected you know i heard a preacher years ago and i really like this he said the reason that this toxin has people ministers have diluted this toxin down until it's not effective anymore they've watered it down by not sharing with them what brother branham preached they've watered it down to try to get popularity to try to get people to like them but my if we can get to a place where we don't care about whether we're popular or not and share the toxin in his power there is power in this toxination and this vaccination to protect you and to show that god cares about you to show that he he he he's a comfort to you i know we're getting wrong on around now i i see i know i know after about 45 minutes people begin to kind of your mind stops working and ticking in the way that it used to and my there's so many things that i wanted to get to this morning about how the brother brown said that there's two churches this morning and how the one church is reasoning against the word of god and the things that brother wade's been preaching and about how it's really a heart condition not a mind condition where you don't look at it intellectually see that's the whole the whole problem was we look at it all intellectually with our mind instead of letting our heart get into condition to just receive god's word to just receive his word so let's i'm going to stop right there if the musicians want to go ahead and come brother brown was talking about the condition of this age and and and just proving that god cares in this age that he cared for rahab an outsider a harlot he cared for elijah you think about rahab sitting on that wall but he cared and when she cared he cared for her he cared for elijah when he and he alone cared for god he cared for the hebrew children when they wouldn't bow down he cared he demonstrated his care but but now the point of the whole message is he cared but you've got to care if you come to church uncaring and unmoved and well i'm not going to listen i i don't really care then god can't do anything for you you got to quench quench that thirsty soul so many thirsty souls if you'll just let god satisfy that soul let's stand to our feet and just praise him and worship him [Music] he's given us all the equipment we need to be more like him and give me [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] just lift your hands and worship him this that your desire to be more like jesus [Music] and make [Music] he cares for you do you care [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and make me [Music] make me more like jesus [Music] and give me more likely me more like me [Music] amen you love him this morning so many things that god has done to show that he cares for us there should be no doubt in our mind that he cares for us you know brother brown was running through all the scenarios he said god god to the children of israel he gave them a prophet with a vindicated word he gave him a pillar of fire he gave him all those things and you know he's given us the same things in this day there should be no doubt to us that he cares for us and wants the best for us in this idea let's sing another one jesus i'll never forget what you've done for me jesus i'll never forget how you set me free amen [Music] jesus [Applause] oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] jesus is [Applause] [Music] amen anything else you want to say before i dismiss all right services at two o'clock let's just go to the lord in prayer lord god we thank you for your spirit this afternoon lord we know that you're present here with us lord god proving once again that you care for us lord jesus i pray god that you'll be with us lord as we go to our meals lord jesus and and and and that you'll just bring lord as we return this afternoon at two o'clock lord that you'll just be with us and minister through brother dale oh god help us lord to be attentive lord jesus and to come expecting lord god to see see you do something great in our lives lord we thank you lord god for your word lord jesus thank you lord god for manifesting your word in our lives for all of the grace that you've given unto us proving lord god to us that you care that you're with us lord jesus that you haven't forgotten us that you you haven't left us alone lord god that you're still moving among your people we thank you lord god and we give you all the praise and all the honor and glory amen you're dismissed what you've done for me [Music]
