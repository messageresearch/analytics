[0:01] well you're
[0:03] own all
[0:07] right let's take our Bibles and turn
[0:09] over to the book of Hebrews chapter
[0:16] 9 you want to look at uh verse
[0:28] 19 got it say Amen
[0:33] amen for when Moses had spoken every
[0:36] precept to all the people according to
[0:38] the law he took the blood of calves and
[0:40] of goats with water and Scarlet wool and
[0:43] hissop and sprinkled both the book and
[0:45] all the people saying this is the blood
[0:48] of the new testament which God hath
[0:49] enjoined unto you moreover he sprinkled
[0:52] with blood both the Tabernacle and all
[0:54] the vessels of the ministry and almost
[0:57] all things are by the law purged with
[0:59] blood and with without shedding of blood
[1:01] is no
[1:02] remission let's have a word of
[1:05] prayer Our Father Lord we just come to
[1:08] you this morning Lord with such grateful
[1:10] hearts Lord thanking you father for
[1:13] another wonderful day that you've made
[1:16] Lord we're here to praise you to glorify
[1:18] you and to honor you and Lord I I'm I'm
[1:22] humble Lord I I'm not worthy Lord to be
[1:26] in this position but father as you
[1:29] blessed us Lord Lord we just thank our
[1:31] brother Lord for the opportunity to
[1:33] stand for you and we just ask you to
[1:35] take total and complete control of every
[1:37] word we say every thought Lord may you
[1:40] bless your people and help them is our
[1:43] prayer and our desire bless the words
[1:45] that we've read father we know they are
[1:48] already anointed in Jesus name amen
[1:54] amen so we're looking at at this we know
[1:57] it's the
[1:58] Tabernacle
[2:00] that was in the wilderness and as we
[2:03] look at the
[2:05] Tabernacle
[2:10] um I'm the
[2:15] easel as you look at the
[2:18] Tabernacle God had Moses to build every
[2:21] bit of this according to God's pattern
[2:23] the pattern that God showed Moses and he
[2:26] told Moses don't you deviate one bit bu
[2:30] it exactly the way I said to all right
[2:33] and then Moses came back and told the
[2:35] people but then what did God do God took
[2:38] two men and he placed within those men
[2:42] the knowledge of how to do these things
[2:45] and so it was not until God chose those
[2:49] two men and placed with them the the
[2:51] knowledge of how to do it that it was
[2:53] actually done all right so then the
[2:55] Tabernacle the tent everything there was
[2:58] built exactly according to to the
[3:00] pattern that God showed Moses in the
[3:02] mountain now when when that was all
[3:05] complete the Tabernacle was complete
[3:07] everything looked just the way God had
[3:10] showed
[3:11] Moses then it had to be
[3:13] Sanctified right and it was Sanctified
[3:16] by that blood that was sprinkled upon it
[3:21] but it still wasn't complete because God
[3:24] still wasn't there right that's right it
[3:27] wasn't until that pillar come down and
[3:31] rested on that Mercy Seat that God was
[3:34] actually there that's right so when we
[3:37] look at that that actually represents
[3:40] you and I right you come in here you
[3:43] make a sacrifice what do you sacrifice
[3:45] your life is a Living Sacrifice you make
[3:48] the sacrifice and then you're washed
[3:52] washed in the water of the word
[3:55] Sanctified set aside for service
[3:57] justification sanctification you go into
[4:00] the holy Place baptism of the Holy Ghost
[4:03] but then you still don't have God
[4:05] dwelling in you you've got to get back
[4:08] into the holiest of holies and that's
[4:10] where you and him have perfect communion
[4:13] until then you can go in and out up and
[4:16] down left and right have all kinds of of
[4:19] things going on but when you once pass
[4:22] through that Veil and he closes the door
[4:26] behind you then you and him are sealed
[4:29] in together
[4:30] you're sealed in Satan's sealed out as a
[4:32] prophet of God said Satan can't come to
[4:34] you but you can you can go to him and
[4:38] what what we do often times is we step
[4:40] so to speak out of that Holy place what
[4:43] are we talking about brother Tim you and
[4:45] I were all born the wrong way that's
[4:49] right and that nature is always trying
[4:53] to take control of your vessel now the
[4:56] vessel itself is not the nature it's
[4:59] just the house just like the house you
[5:01] live in at home that's right that house
[5:06] doesn't so to speak have a spirit of its
[5:08] own right but when you come into it you
[5:11] bring the life into the house that's
[5:14] right but you and I are just a little
[5:17] different cuz we have our own Natural
[5:20] Spirit and until the Holy Ghost himself
[5:24] comes in and takes up his Abode right
[5:28] the wrong Spirits always in control
[5:30] right amen and so as we look at those
[5:33] things it's the very pattern back there
[5:37] was a tie because they never did Moses
[5:41] never had the Holy Ghost dwelling inside
[5:44] him like you and I have that's right
[5:46] amen now he had a seed down inside right
[5:49] right but he could not have that seed
[5:52] take total control of his vessel because
[5:55] Christ himself had not yet died so the
[5:58] Holy Ghost could not dwell in Moses
[6:02] Moses could not be the perfect type of
[6:04] Christ right because he couldn't have
[6:07] the Holy Ghost taking total control but
[6:10] yet Joseph got so
[6:12] close so close right but yet there was
[6:16] always something y okay brother you you
[6:20] you can go back to being brother
[6:23] W good job good but as as you look at
[6:26] that
[6:28] pattern
[6:30] that's like an an eternal pattern
[6:33] because it just keeps repeating all down
[6:35] through the scriptures over and over and
[6:38] over it didn't stop at the Tabernacle in
[6:42] the wilderness the moving Tabernacle no
[6:45] it became Solomon's Tabernacle and then
[6:49] from Solomon's Tabernacle it became the
[6:51] one that Herod built and now well it was
[6:54] actually the the one that zerubabel
[6:56] built and then the one that Herod built
[6:58] and now now they're waiting to build
[7:01] another One
[7:03] MH but in between those last two comes
[7:07] the true Tabernacle amen right yes
[7:10] sir anybody know what that true
[7:12] Tabernacle
[7:14] isus
[7:15] Jus us us
[7:19] right
[7:21] yep because we're the body right that he
[7:25] dwells in we're the Tabernacle no you
[7:27] not you are the Tabernacle that's right
[7:31] of the Holy Ghost the temple amen so
[7:34] we're that Temple and as we look at
[7:37] those
[7:39] things we step back and we look at the
[7:41] message of the
[7:45] hour if your spirit that's in you is
[7:49] reckoned dead and you're are anointed
[7:51] with a life that was in Christ is upon
[7:53] you that's Romans 8:11 now this is it is
[7:57] the rising of the sun paragraph 8 uh
[7:59] 69 if the spirit that raised Christ from
[8:02] the dead dwells in you it also quickens
[8:05] your mortal body
[8:07] amen that same
[8:10] life them same
[8:14] Powers them same
[8:17] beneficiaries that he had here on Earth
[8:19] from God he redeemed you a seed that was
[8:22] for on by God Amen whose names was put
[8:25] on the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[8:26] foundation of the world that's right and
[8:29] the Gospel Light of the Resurrection the
[8:32] confirmation of the word that's it how
[8:35] did we know he was the Christ because he
[8:38] proved what he talked about amen How
[8:41] will I know the message of the hour God
[8:44] proves what he promised and he talks
[8:47] about it that is the identification that
[8:50] we are beneficiaries with him in the
[8:53] resurrection he proves what he has
[8:55] talked about
[8:57] so we we have
[9:01] today the proof mhm of the Resurrection
[9:05] yes sir if that same Spirit dwells in
[9:09] you
[9:12] right and so often
[9:15] we do not allow that
[9:19] Spirit to really control our life we
[9:23] That's right The Human Side takes
[9:25] control and that's when we stumble and
[9:27] fall that's when when we have doubts
[9:30] when we have fears because in him there
[9:33] is no fear sir he is love perfect love
[9:36] and perfect love casteth out all fear
[9:39] all doubt that's right and when we step
[9:43] out of that holiest of holies and we
[9:45] step into that Holy place that's when
[9:47] the doubts and the fears and all those
[9:49] things take control that's right
[9:52] and we you and I should seek to dwell in
[9:58] that holiest of
[10:00] to never come out of that holiest of Hol
[10:04] Satan's job is to draw you out amen
[10:08] that's his task that's what he is put
[10:11] here to do because God has chosen him to
[10:16] be so to speak our Perfection because
[10:20] the trials and the tribulations of your
[10:23] faith brings about your Perfection and
[10:27] it's always trying to pull you out of
[10:30] that perfect
[10:32] position the scripture tells us that by
[10:34] our words we shall be justified or we
[10:37] shall be condemned so the power of life
[10:40] and death It also says lays in the
[10:44] tongue so the power of life is in the
[10:48] tongue you know brother Brown makes the
[10:50] statement that the lips are the sex
[10:54] glands yeah now that staggers so many
[10:57] people until you go back and look at
[11:00] what the Original Seed is exactly the
[11:03] Original Seed is the spoken
[11:07] word so the spiritual sexual Affair that
[11:13] Eve had with a serpent was her yeah yeah
[11:17] was what he told her right he drew her
[11:20] out with that spiritual sexual Affair by
[11:23] the tale that he told her and he drew
[11:27] her out and once he Drew her out of that
[11:31] holiest place she no longer had
[11:35] protection so now he woed her and he got
[11:38] her to come out to him and it was over
[11:41] with boom because then the flesh
[11:43] followed the spirit and the same thing
[11:47] happens every day in this
[11:50] world by people all over the world
[11:53] that's right now one of the things that
[11:55] we often forget is that sinners are not
[11:59] condemned for sinning that's right
[12:01] they're not condemned for drinking
[12:02] smoking cussing carrying on adultery all
[12:04] those things that's right right the
[12:06] prophet said they're condemned on a
[12:08] higher level right and that higher level
[12:11] is they have
[12:13] rejected the sacrifice right right now
[12:16] he said only Christians can sin that's
[12:19] right I TR that's such a staggering
[12:23] thing it's so far from the
[12:25] denominational ideah that people in the
[12:28] world
[12:29] can't believe it but it's been given to
[12:32] you and I so we can understand our daily
[12:35] walk our daily Journey that's it because
[12:38] when Jesus brought them in to the upper
[12:43] or the not the upper room but the Last
[12:45] Supper MH and he instituted foot washing
[12:49] and communion
[12:52] M what did he tell
[12:54] Peter he told Peter if I don't wash you
[12:58] you have no heart in me that's right and
[13:00] then Peter turns right around and says
[13:01] well wash me all over head hands he said
[13:04] you don't need to be washed all
[13:07] over just your feet y the hands and the
[13:13] feet is what was
[13:15] washed in that picture right there if
[13:18] you look at that that
[13:21] labor you will
[13:23] see and you go back into Exodus there
[13:26] and you find out what God told those
[13:29] those priests to do was to wash their
[13:31] hands and their
[13:34] feet what was the representation it's
[13:37] the representation of you and I
[13:41] having foot washing washing when I wash
[13:46] your feet it's my hands that's getting
[13:50] washed and then you in turn wash my feet
[13:53] my feet get washed your hands get washed
[13:55] that's right and what is that doing it's
[13:58] washing away away the daily quote
[14:01] sins that we get caught up in because we
[14:05] walk in the world yes you can't help the
[14:08] filth that surround you you you you have
[14:11] to walk in it God put us here for that
[14:14] purpose that we can be lights in a dark
[14:18] and sinful World we're put here for that
[14:21] purpose we're not put here to be monks
[14:23] set aside in some place to never
[14:25] interact with the people we're put here
[14:27] to be a bright and Shining Light we're
[14:30] not supposed to be a a candle put under
[14:32] a bushel right we're supposed to be out
[14:35] here walking among the people so that
[14:38] somebody can see your light and they can
[14:41] hunger and thirst after righteousness
[14:44] and be filled just like you are AB so
[14:47] that's the whole purpose of it and the
[14:49] Lord when he instituted that foot
[14:51] washing it was already pictured way back
[14:54] there in the very beginning it was
[14:57] coming and it's that foot washing that
[14:59] had to take place right you had to be
[15:02] cleansed you first had the sacrifice
[15:04] then you were cleansed and then once
[15:07] they were cleansed then they could go
[15:09] into the holy
[15:11] place to perform the service unto the
[15:13] Lord right so
[15:15] sanctification cleans you and sets you
[15:18] aside but it doesn't put you in service
[15:20] the prophet of God said the baptism of
[15:22] the Holy Ghost puts you in service so
[15:24] you go into that Holy place and then you
[15:27] can be in service to the Lord maybe you
[15:30] are praying for somebody else just like
[15:34] the altar of incense right there that's
[15:36] right the the in the Book of Revelations
[15:38] we're told that that incense is the
[15:40] prayers of the Saints so when you take
[15:43] that and look at it see it's pictur all
[15:45] the way back in the beginning what
[15:47] started you end with what you start with
[15:50] it has to be the same picture at the end
[15:52] am and whenever you look at that you and
[15:56] I walk into that hole holy place as an
[15:59] intercessor for someone else offering up
[16:02] prayers for their needs that's why you
[16:06] had the the prayer requests that were
[16:08] given here earlier that's what we do
[16:11] because we are Kings and Priests that's
[16:15] right and in that Priestly office we
[16:17] offer up those prayers into the Saints
[16:20] we also take the natural
[16:23] Candlestick and see to it that that
[16:25] light continues to burn that's right
[16:27] what the church Church yes right this
[16:30] church is a light into this un this
[16:32] little neighborhood so you keep the
[16:35] church in good working order you pay for
[16:38] it you take care of it you come you
[16:40] service to the Lord play music
[16:44] somebody's got to clean the floor
[16:46] somebody's got to do this somebody's
[16:47] going to do that it's all part of the
[16:50] service unto the Lord and it's just
[16:54] showing from way back
[16:57] there and today it's the same picture it
[17:01] did not change the type and now we're
[17:04] the antitype we are actually doing the
[17:07] service unto the Lord but then it goes
[17:10] beyond
[17:11] service and into the fullness of
[17:14] communion right so you had to First be
[17:18] justified with a sacrifice Sanctified
[17:22] with the cleansing at the labor then
[17:24] baptized with the Holy Ghost to bring
[17:27] you into that Holy place because if you
[17:29] never get into the holy place you can't
[17:31] get into the holiest of holies that's
[17:34] right but there's no
[17:37] door from the holy Place into the
[17:40] holiest why there's no door on the
[17:43] outside why because it's picturing you
[17:46] and
[17:47] I there's no door handle on your heart
[17:51] and on my heart it's that free moral
[17:55] agency it's that your own self-will you
[17:58] choose to open that door unto the Holy
[18:02] Ghost if you don't open it then the only
[18:05] thing that God can do with you is
[18:07] baptize you with the Holy Ghost to the
[18:08] spirit level and use whatever gift he's
[18:11] put in your life for his purpose amen
[18:14] amen and that's why the prophet of God
[18:16] could say you can be baptized with the
[18:19] Holy Ghost every day of your life and
[18:21] die and go straight to hell that's right
[18:23] because that place of communion was
[18:27] never opened up
[18:29] unto the Holy Ghost so he himself could
[18:32] take possession of that vessel and
[18:35] that's the reason that you and I today
[18:39] must have that token life of Jesus
[18:43] Christ dwelling in us because it is what
[18:48] gives us the right to take the Rapture
[18:51] right amen it's that token life on
[18:54] display that will bring about the
[18:57] rapture it will literally take you into
[19:00] the Rapture you can't miss the Rapture
[19:03] if you've got that token life it's
[19:05] impossible for you to miss the Rapture
[19:07] that's right amen because it's what's
[19:08] going to cause the Rapture that's right
[19:12] and even
[19:14] now we're already in the Rapture because
[19:19] we have as a as a prophet has told us
[19:22] throughout the message that we already
[19:25] have begun that because we have already
[19:28] changed from somebody who love to drink
[19:30] smoke carry on do all those things to a
[19:33] person that loves to serve the Lord to
[19:36] read the word to do the things with the
[19:40] Fellowship of The Brothers and Sisters
[19:42] in Christ that before you wouldn't have
[19:44] anything to do with that's right thank
[19:46] you know I can remember a time when I
[19:49] told my natural
[19:50] Dad don't even talk to me about God
[19:53] anymore I don't even want to hear it m
[19:56] see I want nothing to do with it why
[20:00] because I was following my own way
[20:04] that's right I
[20:07] thought but I was actually following
[20:09] Satan's way that's right because there's
[20:11] only two ways there's God's way and
[20:14] there's Satan's way and you will serve
[20:17] one of those two masters there's no
[20:19] other Spirits out there although people
[20:23] try to make it out that there is a third
[20:26] way there is a gray area
[20:28] but there's no such thing it's either
[20:31] right or it's wrong it's either God
[20:34] doing it or it's Satan amen so you and I
[20:37] walk in a world today that they have
[20:40] made it so great there's no such thing
[20:42] as God or the devil yeah oh yeah they're
[20:44] the same thing yeah right that's right
[20:48] but you and I know the truth amen sir
[20:50] and the truth not only will set us free
[20:54] but we can in turn impart that same
[20:56] freedom to others if they will take the
[21:00] time to lend their ear and listen to
[21:02] what we have to say right that's right
[21:04] so as we look at
[21:10] this in the invisible Union of the
[21:14] Bride the prophet of God says and so
[21:17] were you sons of God and Daughters of
[21:19] God before there even was a moon stars
[21:22] or a molecule you are Sons and Daughters
[21:25] of God for you are the you are only the
[21:28] physical manifestation of the attributes
[21:31] that was in God at the beginning that's
[21:33] right for there's only one form of
[21:35] eternal
[21:37] life and that was God right that ain't
[21:40] what he said
[21:41] no and that was you that's right
[21:46] before you don't know nothing about it
[21:49] neither did you know when you was in
[21:50] your Earthly father right but you are
[21:52] manifested too In His Image in the image
[21:56] of God you are made and you were
[21:58] manifested for the glory and The
[22:00] Fellowship Of God y now if we go back to
[22:03] that
[22:05] Tabernacle like I said in the very
[22:08] beginning it was all fine and good and
[22:11] done perfectly and everything was there
[22:13] that was supposed to
[22:15] be even after the blood had been
[22:18] sprinkled on it everything was now
[22:20] Sanctified and
[22:21] ready yep but it took that
[22:26] atmosphere of God
[22:28] himself coming
[22:31] down and when he settled down over that
[22:34] Mercy
[22:35] Seat then that Tabernacle was complete
[22:38] right because the purpose that it had
[22:40] been made for it was now doing right
[22:44] right and you and I were made to be Sons
[22:48] and Daughters of God from the very
[22:50] beginning and just like that Mercy Seat
[22:53] housed the word down inside of it it was
[22:57] under that Mercy SE it was down on the
[22:59] inside yes you and I come to this Earth
[23:03] with the word buried within us but it
[23:07] takes that atmosphere of the Holy Ghost
[23:10] to strike that word dwelling within you
[23:14] and when that Holy Spirit anoints that
[23:18] word life comes from the sea that it was
[23:21] dwelling within it from the very
[23:22] beginning that's right because in the
[23:24] Book of Genesis it says that God put the
[23:28] seeds out there and the life was within
[23:32] the seed right it's there but it takes
[23:36] something to strike it to bring it to
[23:38] life how many times have we heard the
[23:41] prophet of God say on tape how that that
[23:45] baby would come into the Earth the water
[23:49] would come the blood would come and the
[23:52] baby comes forth he said and then
[23:54] something would have to strike it right
[23:57] a shock a little
[23:59] spank and then the life comes it takes
[24:03] that right atmosphere and it's the
[24:05] atmosphere of the Holy Ghost
[24:07] himself that drops in and brings to life
[24:11] what's within the sea exactly now it
[24:14] also does it for the wrong s because
[24:16] just as it brought forth Jesus Christ it
[24:19] brought forth Judas is
[24:21] car just as it brought forth Peter it
[24:24] brought forth cesis so all these things
[24:27] that we see
[24:28] whatever life is in the seed that's what
[24:31] the holy spirit's going to bring
[24:32] forth yes I have a question does that
[24:36] does that make God a respector of person
[24:39] if he if he decided to choose his seed
[24:42] in some people and the wrong seed in
[24:45] other
[24:46] people before they were does it make him
[24:49] a respect of person it does not because
[24:54] of who he is because of his great for
[24:58] knowledge he knew the end before there
[25:00] ever was a beginning so he knew what
[25:04] Esau was going to do God knew Esau was
[25:07] going to sell to Jacob his
[25:11] Birthright God knew Esau despised the
[25:16] birthright before Esau was ever born
[25:18] right and he knows what choice you will
[25:20] make what choice I will make he knew
[25:23] what choice William Brandon would make
[25:26] he knew Jeremiah what Choice he would
[25:28] make he told Jeremiah I knew you before
[25:31] you were ever conceived I knew you and
[25:34] made you a prophet into the Nations so
[25:37] it's because of his great forn knowledge
[25:39] that he knows therefore he can
[25:42] predestinate that's right the for
[25:44] knowledge is the key but if he did not
[25:46] know then that would make him a
[25:48] respector person that's right but
[25:50] because he knows what choice we'll make
[25:52] before we ever make it then that makes
[25:55] him just and righteous
[25:58] so if you have the desire in your heart
[26:00] to serve God you're on the right path
[26:03] even if you keep failing um I'm asking
[26:07] this for my sister I'm sure even if you
[26:09] keep failing and you're trying yes you
[26:13] know God still with you take care of it
[26:15] amen let let me put it this way there is
[26:18] a
[26:19] thirst all right right but before you
[26:23] can have a
[26:24] thirst there has to be something to
[26:26] satisfy The Thirst
[26:30] first so the satisfier is here first so
[26:33] if you have a thirst to serve God God is
[26:37] here right to satisfy that thirst so if
[26:42] you continue to walk the scripture says
[26:44] they that hunger and thirst after
[26:46] righteousness shall be filled that's
[26:49] right so just keep walking keep walking
[26:52] and God will open up unto you what's
[26:55] necessary for you to have that
[26:57] righteousness yes and going into that
[27:00] Tabernacle when you were in that outer
[27:02] Court there was no covering so when it
[27:03] rained you got wet right when the Sun
[27:06] was shining you had good days so you
[27:07] have good days and bad days in that
[27:09] outer Court of the Walk of justification
[27:11] but as you go into that inner Court
[27:14] that's right it was veiled it had a
[27:15] shield over it it shielded you from all
[27:17] the outside stuff so walking in
[27:20] justification man you going
[27:22] have lots of ups and downs and ins and
[27:25] outs doubts fears
[27:28] all those things brother BR said the
[27:29] only way you know that you're a child of
[27:31] God is you get up and go again right and
[27:33] not quit and not quit it don't matter
[27:36] how many times you fall it really
[27:38] doesn't it just matter how many times
[27:40] you get up absolutely absolutely you say
[27:44] 25 after yeah that's close we need we
[27:47] got a big crowd thank you brother
[27:52] Tim
