[0:00] now last Sunday we kind of we didn't get
[0:02] off the track but we kind of got off the
[0:06] track a little but still it all makes
[0:08] sense when you're talking
[0:12] about the seals right because the seals
[0:16] is what it's a revelation of Jesus
[0:17] Christ it's a revelation that was hidden
[0:20] from man that nobody knew no one knew
[0:23] this except the son of
[0:25] man that's why the son of man had to
[0:28] come
[0:28] back to start revealing himself through
[0:31] a Prophet this time right because he
[0:35] can't come back in flesh and do it
[0:36] himself so he had to go he had to come
[0:38] through a flesh called William Brown to
[0:41] bring us
[0:43] the uh opening of the Seven Seals but
[0:48] but watch Jesus preached them while he
[0:50] was
[0:51] here no one knew that there was no
[0:54] commentator ever God himself had to
[0:57] reveal to William Bram that Matthew 2
[0:59] four was the seals
[1:02] because now without a revelation to read
[1:05] that all Jesus is doing is he's telling
[1:08] them they ask him what what did they ask
[1:10] him let's go right
[1:12] here tell us when shall these things be
[1:15] what he said one stone won't be on
[1:17] another right the temple he's talking
[1:18] about the temple and they said look at
[1:20] this great glorious Temple he said won't
[1:22] be a stone on top of another one well
[1:25] when will this be and what shall be the
[1:27] sign of thy coming and and of the end of
[1:30] the world so there three things that
[1:32] they asked
[1:34] him and Jesus answered and said unto
[1:36] them take heed that no man deceive you
[1:38] for many shall come in my name saying I
[1:40] am Christ and shall deceive many well
[1:41] there's your first seal the first seal
[1:43] opened right there in its let let me let
[1:46] me tell you this way it opened in its
[1:48] letter
[1:49] form everybody understand what I'm
[1:51] saying it opened in its letter form it
[1:53] did not open in a full Revelation right
[1:56] everybody got that it was in now he knew
[1:59] it
[2:00] now the son of man knew at this time of
[2:03] his ministry he he knew we're going to
[2:06] talk about that this afternoon about how
[2:08] that that the Bible says that Jesus grew
[2:11] in Grace and
[2:12] knowledge and being made perfect right
[2:15] when now we know his his body is what
[2:17] they're talking about it's not talking
[2:19] about his soul or his Spirit but there
[2:21] is a connection there that Jesus didn't
[2:24] know all things while he was
[2:26] here right now who was and I was looking
[2:30] yesterday or tonight or last night and
[2:33] today how in the world can you read
[2:36] Matthew 17 where Jesus goes up the
[2:38] mountain talks to Moses and
[2:40] Elijah the cloud comes down and says
[2:43] what this is my beloved Son whom I
[2:45] please dwell here you him that's all
[2:47] there's no other
[2:49] commentary and then you see brother
[2:50] randam he says well they were talking to
[2:52] anybody's
[2:54] coming right how do you get that out of
[2:56] that you see what I'm saying you you
[2:58] look at some things and you think how'd
[2:59] that come well it had to come from God
[3:01] that had to be what happened uh and and
[3:04] we're going to do some things couple
[3:06] more Sundays and bring in the
[3:09] dimensions and I I was kind of chuckling
[3:12] to myself
[3:13] yesterday you remember the preacher that
[3:15] came here and preached and used
[3:17] circumstantial evidence okay well you
[3:21] can use circumstantial evidence if it
[3:23] goes to True evidence but you can't use
[3:25] circumstantial evidence and it stays
[3:27] circumstantial evidence and it be wrong
[3:30] right it can be circumstantial until
[3:32] it's proven cuz you have to lead up when
[3:35] you do when a when a lawyer goes up and
[3:36] gives his dissertation to the jury he
[3:39] brings things to light that maybe
[3:42] there's not an exact
[3:44] verbatim
[3:46] quote there's not a Verbatim quote in
[3:48] the in the Bible nowhere that Moses and
[3:51] Elijah spoke to Jesus about coming
[3:55] nowhere but obviously brother random
[4:00] with the mind of God which we should
[4:02] have the same with the mind of God God
[4:05] told him they were talking about his
[4:08] second coming mhm right so you see what
[4:11] I'm saying to us it's circumstantial
[4:13] evidence cuz we have nothing to go on
[4:16] but with God's truth there is no
[4:18] circumstantial evidence because it start
[4:20] you know it has no beginning or end but
[4:22] when you you take you get a revelation
[4:25] it keeps progressing and going it
[4:28] doesn't fall off and say well that must
[4:30] not be right that was just
[4:32] circumstantial in false Doctrine that's
[4:35] true but in the truth of God's word it
[4:39] never will have that that's Eternal
[4:42] right that's Eternal the Eternal Word of
[4:44] God can't be circumstantial evidence so
[4:46] we can use some evidences that we see
[4:50] that are not written cuz what brother R
[4:52] say where the where the where the part
[4:54] that God talks to us is what between the
[4:57] lines okay there's nothing written there
[5:02] seventh seal silence in heaven nothing
[5:04] said why it's already been done it's
[5:07] already been said it's already been
[5:09] finished what he say the seventh seal
[5:11] was the end right so watch so you see
[5:13] right here what I'm leading up to
[5:14] brother the seven seal the end of all
[5:16] things now Jesus preached six Seals All
[5:19] right but he gives him a
[5:21] key this is the this is the typing of
[5:24] the second seal he says but the end is
[5:26] not yet then Paul picks it remember and
[5:30] he goes
[5:30] over and remember the two brothers that
[5:33] were preaching Paul's message they were
[5:37] using that's kind of funny I just
[5:39] thought of that they were using Paul's
[5:43] quotebook remember I told you Sunday
[5:45] afternoon this message without a
[5:47] revelation will kill you because
[5:49] remember a prophet comes and he brings
[5:52] what he brings Revelation condemnation
[5:56] and
[5:57] restoration right his message restored
[6:00] the woman at the widow woman right but
[6:03] it destroyed Jezebel the Elijah the
[6:05] Elijah message that come in right so
[6:07] that's the same way with here if we if
[6:09] we take just a letter of it we'll talk a
[6:12] little bit about it this afternoon but
[6:13] not so much because we got to get up
[6:16] through Jesus's life to where he starts
[6:18] talking with the Pharisees and the
[6:19] Sadducees when John brings it out first
[6:22] John the Baptist calling them Snakes in
[6:24] the Grass
[6:25] vipers you know and then like brother
[6:27] Jean was talking about last night you
[6:29] know you you got to be real re you got
[6:31] to have a lot of resolve to walk up to
[6:33] the religious world the religious
[6:35] leaders of the world and tell them that
[6:37] their daddy is the devil
[6:40] right because they they built their
[6:42] whole life on what they were doing what
[6:44] on the word of
[6:46] Moses
[6:48] right Paul said the letter
[6:52] kth but the spirit of the letter and I'm
[6:56] not interjecting I know that's what he
[6:58] was saying the spirit of the letter is
[6:59] what giveth
[7:03] life cuz I'll I'll read to you this
[7:06] afternoon brother Brown he was talking
[7:08] about the word we say the word was made
[7:10] flesh the word was made
[7:14] dirt the word was made dust because when
[7:18] you go back to Genesis 1 or Genesis 3
[7:21] God cursed what the ground the dirt the
[7:25] curse was on the dirt not on Adam on the
[7:27] dirt Christ had to come back and become
[7:30] dirt what he cursed he became that to
[7:34] take us back up to get us out of this
[7:36] thing right but the seals are too also
[7:39] for
[7:42] that I will this afternoon okay but look
[7:45] you shall hear wars and rumors of wars
[7:47] now that's happened forever right
[7:49] there's been Wars since Canan Abel that
[7:53] was a war it was a two-man War but it
[7:55] was a war all right but he said You
[7:58] shall hear Wars rumors War now remember
[8:01] the second seal what we talking about
[8:03] red right all right let's before I read
[8:06] that let's let's do one let me let me
[8:07] get one one item out of the way because
[8:10] look let me go back I've been trying to
[8:12] stay away from my notes but I got to get
[8:14] back to them
[8:17] um the first
[8:20] seal shows justification right now what
[8:23] is justification it's a purging of your
[8:28] sins okay
[8:29] yes truly the justification part is kind
[8:34] of it's kind of when you're baptized
[8:36] you're re you're real baptis you know
[8:37] the baptism in the water right we know
[8:40] that's just a a good conscious but
[8:42] something has struck your heart that you
[8:44] need to be clean you need to do what
[8:45] God's telling you to do okay so it's
[8:47] purging and it does justification purged
[8:50] your past sins I don't care what you did
[8:52] back here just if you're truly Justified
[8:55] then you're as white as this
[8:57] board when you ask ask God to forgive
[8:59] you right but now what happens in
[9:02] justification you start sinning again CU
[9:06] that old root of evil that same strand
[9:08] that made you do it is still there it's
[9:11] just that God don't see these right here
[9:13] well what a cleansing what a purging and
[9:15] to me that's what the first seal shows
[9:17] it shows one true and living God because
[9:19] look if you got two Gods you can't you
[9:22] you can't you're not purged
[9:25] right if the devil's in there saying
[9:27] he's God he is your god until God's your
[9:31] God Amen the God of this evil world has
[9:35] blinded your eyes right we were all born
[9:38] 10 folks of the devil but once we're
[9:41] purged our old sins are chopped off
[9:44] that's what the first seal should show
[9:45] you that you're as righteous as God is
[9:48] but you still have more to do all right
[9:50] and then the second seal tells you how
[9:53] to do it because see one's got to build
[9:56] on the other one it's like like Dad said
[9:58] about the the stairs you know you build
[10:00] stairs you don't start here youall know
[10:03] what he's talking about cuz right here
[10:05] is your ground when you start here this
[10:07] is your first step but you let that
[10:09] board stick out a little bit further CU
[10:10] your second board's going to sit right
[10:12] down on the first one right M so the end
[10:14] of the first one is the beginning of the
[10:16] second one the ending of the second one
[10:19] is the beginning of the third one
[10:20] everybody you get that yes all right
[10:23] just give you a little visual so that's
[10:24] what the that's what the
[10:26] seals are to do is to what show us
[10:30] let me put it this way a true revelation
[10:32] of seal seals is to show you that it's
[10:34] already
[10:36] done we've got to back up and see that
[10:39] it's already done but we when Jesus
[10:41] preaches this he's telling them it's
[10:43] already done cuz look there was wars and
[10:45] rumors were see that you be not
[10:48] troubled hold on don't be troubled for
[10:52] all these things must come to pass but
[10:55] the end is not yet what all these things
[10:58] but there's more to come
[11:00] right so he was telling them just like
[11:01] Paul there was two people preaching in
[11:03] Paul's day using Paul's quote book they
[11:06] said Paul said the resurrection is over
[11:08] cuz remember Paul says resurrected sit
[11:10] in Heavenly places they were teaching
[11:13] teaching to Soul seven Thunder whatever
[11:17] you want to say this in the message Paul
[11:18] had a message right and there was a
[11:21] false that came out of that message well
[11:23] those two preachers were
[11:25] preaching Paul says Resurrection over
[11:28] mhm Paul said I ain't talking about that
[11:30] he said I'm talking about an out
[11:30] Resurrection remember he goes and
[11:32] explains he's talking about this you
[11:33] know this Resurrection not a physical
[11:35] Resurrection cuz remember Paul
[11:37] says it's not coming in this time
[11:39] remember brother R said he tried to
[11:40] explain to the people that the
[11:42] resurrection is not coming right now
[11:45] Paul could see through a glass Darkly
[11:47] and I'll guarantee you Paul could
[11:49] see The
[11:51] Headstone cuz I'm going to tell you
[11:53] something and we'll read it in a couple
[11:56] Sundays from
[11:57] now what is the right right hand of
[12:04] power what's your right hand of
[12:07] power getting a little ahead of myself
[12:09] but I want to show you when it comes in
[12:10] here excuse me what's the U what's the
[12:13] right hand of power step when Steven
[12:16] well actually we're going to read it
[12:18] Jesus said the son of
[12:20] man when he's risen is going to sit on
[12:24] the right hand of God mhm now when
[12:26] Steven is stoned he said said the heaven
[12:29] open now there's not there wasn't some
[12:32] no he had a vision into another
[12:35] dimension he said I see Jesus S standing
[12:38] on the right hand of God with
[12:41] power now what is that Son of God or son
[12:44] of man that's the son of man so the son
[12:48] of man is the one that sits on the right
[12:50] hand of power why Jesus never said all
[12:53] power and Heaven and Earth been given
[12:55] unto me until his death burial
[12:57] Resurrection
[12:59] Ascension yes now remember he went up
[13:02] then he come back don't touch me I'm not
[13:04] yet ascended then he really went
[13:07] up and what' you do the right hand of
[13:11] power God's always wanted to be in human
[13:16] flesh yes
[13:18] always and Adam and Eve were supposed to
[13:21] produce the body that he lived
[13:24] in
[13:26] hello I got the quotes y brother Bri
[13:29] said eventually Eve would have come to a
[13:31] place to where Jesus Christ's body would
[13:33] have come through
[13:34] Eve he
[13:36] so Eve we're second Eve right right yes
[13:40] so where's Jesus's body supposed to come
[13:43] through but now it's a Min membered body
[13:45] that's right and God's always wanted to
[13:47] have flesh that's why when he was
[13:49] sitting on the right hand of power and
[13:50] he said all power in heaven and earth
[13:52] been given unto me he said it in a flesh
[13:54] body that could eat drink but could had
[13:56] no limitations mhm
[13:59] there's the right hand of power
[14:01] everybody's w't know you know sit here
[14:03] till till you know Heaven is my throne
[14:05] and Earth is my foot still why is he
[14:08] connected to
[14:12] Earth Heaven is my Throne Earth is my
[14:14] foot St
[14:16] that's you not the round
[14:19] ball you always think when we everybody
[14:22] says Earth you go earth right no Earth
[14:27] no but cuz
[14:30] remember without this Earth being
[14:32] changed first this Earth doesn't have a
[14:35] chance cuz this Earth fell first yes
[14:38] that's why the son of man had to come be
[14:40] human flesh to be made
[14:43] dirt to cleanse that dirt that's like I
[14:46] said last Sunday if you remember he
[14:47] didn't come to clean the womb per se cuz
[14:50] she had seven or eight kids after that
[14:52] you understand you know physically y all
[14:54] understand what I'm saying so it wasn't
[14:56] that he cleaned the womb he approved of
[14:59] what was going on he brought his the
[15:01] beginning of the creation through the
[15:03] womb of
[15:04] Mary but now that the man's grown up and
[15:07] gone it's not the womb of your flesh
[15:09] it's the womb of your heart all
[15:13] right cuz really you know you to be real
[15:16] honest with you you can be a prostitute
[15:17] and then get and get born again well
[15:19] then your wound's clean not your
[15:21] physical one yeah but your spiritual
[15:23] wound all
[15:26] right so you see how this is going to
[15:28] prog rest this is not just this is not
[15:31] just baby form justification baby form
[15:34] sanctification this tells you that
[15:35] you're cleansed this tells you
[15:38] how right this tells you how first seal
[15:42] tells you what the first seal is so
[15:44] important it's what makes you aware
[15:46] where God is and where you are to me
[15:50] that's and then that's true
[15:51] justification those who is Justified
[15:53] he's already glorified
[15:55] right then we come to sanctification
[15:58] where we're talking about a Sanctified
[15:59] body that the blood of Jesus Christ the
[16:02] physical blood doesn't do anything for
[16:04] you it was the Life In The Blood
[16:06] remember the physical blood I'm sure
[16:08] they just dumped water on the cross and
[16:10] the physical blood just ran out on the
[16:12] ground and and and U um dehydrated and
[16:17] you know just went away but the life
[16:19] that was in that blood knowing that he
[16:21] shed that blood for us that's what did
[16:24] it but look take this seal go back to
[16:27] here go to hear you shall hear wars and
[16:30] rumors of wars never been a war fault
[16:33] with that
[16:35] Bloodshed right right even in the
[16:37] spiritual part cuz remember Jesus had to
[16:39] come down here in the flesh though to
[16:41] take away our spiritual warfare
[16:44] yes yes amen so you got to remember that
[16:48] it was the
[16:50] blood that did
[16:52] it the life that was in the blood it did
[16:54] it but the blood is always a
[16:56] representation all right so so this
[16:58] second seal is a representation that
[17:01] that red horse rider went out he went
[17:03] out to do his job and he did it during
[17:06] the Dark Ages right
[17:09] here there was natural war and spiritual
[17:12] war going on cuz brother brand says
[17:15] millon 68 million Christians were killed
[17:17] during the Dark
[17:19] Ages you know that's a third of the
[17:21] population of the United
[17:24] [Music]
[17:27] States that's probably California
[17:30] Florida New York City totally wiped off
[17:32] the mouth not a person in them all dead
[17:35] so you think wars and rumors of wars
[17:37] happened and then brother Brown said
[17:38] Untold billions spiritually dead because
[17:42] of the spiritual warfare cuz you know
[17:44] what it started here and it never
[17:48] stopped it never really stops until the
[17:51] Battle of dog and
[17:55] meog cuz remember the AR the battle of
[17:57] Armageddon is a natural battle the
[18:00] battle of go and Magog is a spiritual
[18:02] battle demons is not going to die in the
[18:05] battle of Armageddon they just going to
[18:06] be put in a place where they can't do
[18:08] anything then they're going to be be
[18:10] released but the spiritual battle the
[18:13] battle of go and Magog God's going to
[18:15] kill those Spirits cuz he's the only one
[18:16] that can kill them he's the one that
[18:17] made them he's the one that can kill
[18:18] them
[18:19] right but you'll hear wars and rumors of
[18:22] War see that you be not trouble and
[18:24] truly to me remember what I said about
[18:26] sanctification being a a horrible a
[18:29] wonderful place to be but a horrible
[18:30] place to be why you're Waring you don't
[18:33] have the Holy Ghost yet now this is way
[18:34] back down you you don't have the Holy
[18:36] Ghost yet but you're Sanctified God's
[18:38] cleaning you up you're going to church
[18:39] you're doing things your desires are
[18:41] different than you've ever had before
[18:42] and you got these thoughts in your mind
[18:43] of of God and about what he's done for
[18:46] you right
[18:49] right did you not have
[18:51] wars I mean we still have wars now but I
[18:54] mean to me that was really a war because
[18:57] Satan comes in on this horse and he says
[19:00] don't worry everything's fine you got it
[19:03] don't worry everything's fine I didn't
[19:05] turn
[19:07] something everything's fine don't worry
[19:09] about
[19:10] it you're okay don't you feel
[19:15] religious yes don't you feel good now
[19:18] you feel like you been for a while
[19:20] ecclesiastical rabbit that's right yeah
[19:23] yeah something here and there what
[19:25] brother Brown said that's right but now
[19:28] now watch though remember the scripture
[19:29] in Matthew the unclean Spirit goes out
[19:31] of a
[19:32] man walks in dry places excuse me
[19:36] seeketh rest findeth none comes back cu
[19:40] the Cup's not full yet I was talking
[19:42] about last Sunday the Cup's not full yet
[19:44] and it's not sealed cups got to be full
[19:47] and
[19:48] sealed grieve not the holy spirit of God
[19:50] whereby you are what sealed until the
[19:53] day of your Redemption all right cuz if
[19:55] you don't seal it guess what will happen
[19:57] if that cup tips over all that just
[20:00] spild right
[20:02] out brother the way but that ceiling
[20:04] takes place down at Faith that's correct
[20:07] that sealing takes place at the new
[20:08] birth that's grieve not the holy spirit
[20:11] of God whereby you are sealed
[20:14] unto the day of your
[20:18] Redemption that's why I said last Sunday
[20:20] remember hold that word Redemption cuz
[20:22] everything everything God did was to
[20:25] redeem us
[20:27] back
[20:28] and I believe I I believe what brother
[20:30] Jean said there was a there was a place
[20:33] I'm sorry Lord but this is the mind of
[20:36] God that's where we all were we were in
[20:38] the Supernatural Mind Of
[20:40] God right and he wanted children so he
[20:44] brought Adam and Eve to do the job well
[20:47] they you know what happened to that so
[20:49] he came
[20:51] himself with me and you in that mind of
[20:55] that man called Jesus
[20:59] and he was there sure sure he said I
[21:02] come to my own but the Bible said he
[21:05] went to his own his own receive him
[21:07] not so he turned to the Gentiles but he
[21:10] never forgot Israel he's going to still
[21:11] get 144,000 he's still going to redeem a
[21:13] lot you know the first first church age
[21:16] was mostly Jews
[21:18] anyway 120 Upper Room were all Jews the
[21:21] 3,000 downstairs were mixed a little bit
[21:24] but it was mostly a Jewish uh Paul oh
[21:28] all led him so he was a Jew right right
[21:31] so he led them now these that come up a
[21:33] little bit more you're getting more
[21:35] Gentiles cuz you really don't see any
[21:36] more
[21:37] Jewish you see Jewish roots but when the
[21:41] tree tree grew up it was Gentile
[21:43] because it's a nation so CU see the next
[21:46] seal we're going to see Nation shall
[21:47] rise against Nation Kingdom against
[21:49] Kingdom which is a natural and then we
[21:52] got to look at the spiritual part just
[21:53] like
[21:54] this you shall hear wars and rumors of
[21:57] War see that you be not trouble you're
[21:59] going to have them this Jesus is really
[22:01] telling them said look this is what's
[22:02] going to happen but don't worry about it
[22:05] don't worry about it be not troubled for
[22:07] all these things must come to pass must
[22:10] come to pass all right so they're coming
[22:13] they're already here but then they're
[22:15] like he said they're already here but
[22:16] they're coming you think all this is
[22:18] going on now he said Jesus did he said
[22:20] this is nothing the end is not yet you
[22:24] going to it's going to get
[22:25] worse right now Nation again you know
[22:28] wars and rumors of wars can be a small
[22:30] battle but nations against Nations
[22:33] you're talking bigger Kingdom against
[22:35] Kingdom famines pestilence earthqu and D
[22:38] place so to to be in this Sanctified
[22:41] condition is a good condition to be in
[22:45] but it's a horrible condition you say
[22:46] well what about now that we're talking
[22:48] about the second seal this
[22:51] is as we were talking before last Sunday
[22:55] L had a question so we're going to we
[22:57] we're going to show and I think I
[22:59] preached it a long time ago and I may
[23:00] have to go back over again but we're
[23:03] going to use justification
[23:04] sanctification and the Holy Ghost
[23:06] everybody okay with that cuz that's what
[23:08] puts you in the body right here at Faith
[23:11] right according to the prophet's message
[23:13] and according to the Bible Paul Peter
[23:18] says add to your faith virtue and it
[23:23] says having the divine nature add to
[23:26] your fa okay there's only one divine
[23:28] nature and it ain't the guy that's on
[23:29] that horse right there no no it's the
[23:32] Holy Ghost all right you get the Holy
[23:34] Ghost you start here at Faith as a
[23:37] baby
[23:38] right
[23:40] baby but then you go to truly go through
[23:43] the statute of perfect man you got to do
[23:45] it
[23:46] again cuz remember right here what does
[23:48] that say holy
[23:54] ghost
[23:56] right then now we're talking about the
[23:58] seals we're up here to where we do it
[24:04] again three Perfection right
[24:07] justification sanctification baptism the
[24:08] Holy Ghost but three stages of
[24:10] justification three stages of
[24:12] sanctification three stages of the
[24:13] baptism the Holy Ghost this is the baby
[24:16] this is my beloved Son whom I pleased to
[24:17] dwell we'll talk about that this
[24:19] afternoon Jesus went through everything
[24:21] just like we go through it he didn't
[24:23] need it but he did it for me and you all
[24:26] right then he cuz
[24:29] remember you got to you got to see
[24:33] this this is the body of Jesus right
[24:36] just right
[24:39] okay that's what came on the day of
[24:43] Pentecost the holy ghost in the
[24:46] Believers right yes to put them at Faith
[24:51] the
[24:52] 3,000 but the others that had it they
[24:55] had already been tutored by the word
[24:56] himself to come to this place the 120
[25:00] okay but this is building the body on
[25:03] this rock I'll build my church now what
[25:06] is the church the church is not the
[25:11] head the church is the body yes but
[25:15] brother Brandon we it took a
[25:19] messenger it took a messenger to come to
[25:22] show us that the head and body must
[25:26] unite cuz all during the church ages
[25:29] they never talked about
[25:35] that headstone was what
[25:39] rejected but you know what Jesus it's
[25:41] not over
[25:43] here it's right
[25:47] here he become the chief of the
[25:49] Cornerstone Chief Cornerstone that
[25:51] everything built up to that comes up to
[25:55] what that the head and the body will
[25:57] Unite well it brings
[26:00] back what the
[26:04] intelligence brother
[26:06] brandham said many times he said I had
[26:09] to go back and listen to the tape he
[26:10] said somebody said I said something and
[26:12] I didn't know I said it why did he not
[26:14] know he said it God was talking that's
[26:16] right yes amen God was talking and
[26:20] that's what we got to come to the son of
[26:22] man Ministry was God
[26:25] talking now the Son of God Ministry
[26:27] let's just be real honest a lot of it
[26:30] was man
[26:33] talking God didn't tell him to baptizing
[26:35] name father son Holy Ghost right that
[26:39] horse rider did the one that rode right
[26:43] here right here
[26:46] right cuz that's when it developed
[26:49] during that long Church age right there
[26:50] is when the doctrines of the Roman
[26:54] Catholic church and the others Baptist
[26:56] Methodist what see they've got their
[26:59] Foundation but their Foundation wasn't
[27:01] built on Apostles and Prophets Jesus
[27:03] Christ being Chief Cornerstone their
[27:04] their Foundation was built on man's
[27:07] ideas and then what they do they built
[27:09] up a church to where now it's going to
[27:12] be so
[27:14] close Judas and Jesus set at the same
[27:18] table all 11 disciples were
[27:23] deceived Jesus and Judas were the only
[27:25] two people that knew who they were
[27:30] mhm Judas didn't come in he wasn't the
[27:32] number 13 Outsider right he was number
[27:37] well I don't even know say number 12 he
[27:39] always list him last in the Bible I
[27:41] guess cuz it says Judas Carri Judas is
[27:43] car who de who you know sold the Lord
[27:46] out did you say there are also three
[27:49] stages in The Headstone absolutely sure
[27:51] there are what are they I mean
[27:53] justification sanctification baptism
[27:55] Holy Ghost yeah absolutely
[27:58] we taugh that brother taught that for
[27:59] years and years and years years and
[28:01] years that that's the Redemption to it
[28:04] is that right that's
[28:05] it cuz this that here is body hey look
[28:09] your Soul's already redeemed Soul's
[28:11] redeemed right
[28:13] here right you've just got so much you
[28:17] got to learn just like Jesus did Jesus
[28:19] was God Almighty in human flesh and
[28:21] until he was we're going to talk about
[28:23] it
[28:24] today you see him at 13 and you don't
[28:26] see him no more till 13
[28:28] there's things he had to go through that
[28:30] we're going to assume or or use
[28:32] circumstantial evidence to show that he
[28:35] was learning how to live in a human body
[28:37] God had never learned to live in a human
[28:38] body
[28:39] before not alone he tried to get into
[28:43] body he's in the body now but he had to
[28:46] come himself they listen there was
[28:48] nobody else in there but
[28:51] him listen I'm telling you there's
[28:53] things that that we have to realize that
[28:56] that God had to did what he did and he
[28:59] had to work through a human natural
[29:02] setting that's why we won't get to it
[29:05] this Sunday but maybe in a couple more
[29:07] Sundays that's why he lived so close to
[29:09] human life that they didn't believe he
[29:10] was
[29:11] God they watched
[29:14] him he ate corn in the
[29:17] field but everything he did was not
[29:21] contrary to the word it was contrary to
[29:24] their
[29:25] idea right and that's the thing now we
[29:28] do a lot of things that's contrary to
[29:30] God but we think right that's why it
[29:33] takes these seals to separate bring the
[29:36] headstone back into
[29:39] power to where that this
[29:43] justification we got to
[29:46] know that we didn't do
[29:49] it brother Brown come to a place he said
[29:51] the real you didn't do it Jesus came to
[29:54] a place to where when he said
[29:57] I must be about my father's business at
[29:59] 13 years old he separated
[30:03] himself from the
[30:06] family cuz remember after that you know
[30:09] they could say well your sisters and
[30:10] your brothers are here he said who are
[30:12] my sisters and my brothers who is my
[30:14] mother you ye are my brothers and my
[30:16] sisters brother Brown comes up to the
[30:18] communion 1965 he said found I wasn't a
[30:21] son of Charles NE
[30:24] Brown same thing he came to a place not
[30:29] denying who he was Jesus knew he came
[30:32] through the womb of
[30:34] Mary of course but he was about his
[30:37] father's business from that point
[30:39] forward cuz he didn't go back and start
[30:41] building doors we'll read it cuz I got
[30:42] quotes where brother Brown said he
[30:44] didn't go back and start building doors
[30:45] and
[30:47] windows cuz if he' have been about his
[30:49] father's business natural he went back
[30:52] with Joseph but the Bible does say he
[30:54] went back and was subject to him from
[30:55] then on so see there was a human body
[30:59] that was God Almighty and he was subject
[31:00] to to
[31:02] human why he had to be the example child
[31:05] he couldn't been a A rstout or or a
[31:08] rebel he no he was subject to his
[31:09] parents we we get into this half minute
[31:12] that's right but you shall hear War's
[31:14] rumor listen this son of man is not what
[31:16] everybody thinks it is everybody in this
[31:18] message think you get to right hearing
[31:20] buddy you can't do no wrong you ain't
[31:22] got no evil thought when when you look
[31:25] in the bank account if you got $2 all
[31:27] all of a sudden it's
[31:28] 20,000 or if you got you
[31:31] know God can do that if he wants to but
[31:34] sorry H
[31:36] that but you understand what I'm saying
[31:38] everybody's looking at as we go up it's
[31:41] more of sinless perfection that people
[31:44] talk about but remember when Jesus came
[31:47] off that
[31:49] mountain fully knowing everything that
[31:51] he needed to do on
[31:53] Earth from six that brother Brown said 6
[31:56] months later he was dead and that was
[31:58] the worst 6 months because he would go
[32:00] in that Temple they threw him out they
[32:02] didn't like him anymore they didn't want
[32:04] anything to do with him right um there's
[32:07] not a lot of healings after that see
[32:09] we'll get into that there that Healing
[32:11] Ministry you can take brother Brown's
[32:12] Ministry just like this you got Jesus he
[32:15] healed thousands probably Millions he
[32:18] healed and all of a sudden you don't see
[32:20] him doing that much anymore
[32:22] right he lays into them Pharisees he
[32:24] lays into them Sadducees you see brother
[32:27] brandom he comes in he starts preaching
[32:28] the word a little bit but he's Healing
[32:30] The Sick casting out Devils raising the
[32:32] dead but when he comes to that 3 and 1/2
[32:34] year Min
[32:35] stream 20 people in a trailer well see
[32:38] brother rman I think I I can't think I
[32:40] kept that quote he said Jesus would
[32:43] speak to 5 and 6,000 he said he got down
[32:47] to 170 he said he got down to 40 it got
[32:51] down to 12 and it got down to three and
[32:54] then when he went to Calvary it was one
[32:57] he knew what he's supposed to do Calvary
[33:00] is not a place where you have a lot of
[33:02] joy and peace
[33:04] and you understand what I'm
[33:07] saying same thing with
[33:09] us it's not going to look so to the
[33:12] world that cuz remember if the son of
[33:14] man Ministry let me say one more time if
[33:16] the son of man Ministry is here like it
[33:17] was then they're going to look at you
[33:20] and say if you be
[33:22] God if you be God do this if you be God
[33:27] do
[33:29] that come down come out of that
[33:31] tribulation it's what they were saying
[33:33] to Jesus on the cross if if you who you
[33:35] say you do come down off the cross come
[33:37] down that from that tribulation come
[33:38] down from what's been but we know that
[33:40] he see now we don't have to get on a
[33:42] cross anymore he's already been there we
[33:44] don't have to go but we will have
[33:46] tribulations cuz we'll hear wars and
[33:47] rumors of
[33:48] wars but the true justification and
[33:51] sanctification in The
[33:53] Headstone is no
[33:55] more this has got a lot of man's ideas
[33:58] in it I'm sorry it does it has leaven
[34:01] yes it has leaven in it it has something
[34:06] added got it even the first Pentecostal
[34:09] that came up right here the first
[34:10] Pentecostal that came up in the in the U
[34:13] Lan Church age
[34:17] trinitarian got it so God winked at that
[34:20] he's not winking right here this is the
[34:22] full manifestation of Jesus Christ on
[34:25] the earth just like it was th000 years
[34:28] ago same sign same wonders same
[34:31] manifestation and what is manifestation
[34:33] making known the same thing he said I do
[34:36] nothing except the father shows me so
[34:40] you see that Holy Ghost right there is a
[34:42] body change to
[34:44] me brother BR said there'll come such a
[34:47] baptism that will fill every fi of our
[34:48] being and take us inter rapor well we
[34:50] only have the Holy Ghost in our
[34:53] soul but now what's working on is our
[34:55] spirit going up to the statue of perfect
[34:57] man right and then the same thing
[35:00] here but what's going to happen is is
[35:03] you got to remember we're not going to
[35:05] this is not just exactly like this
[35:08] because remember
[35:11] Jesus had to have a body change right
[35:14] yes so we are going to we're not going
[35:15] to what I'm saying is Under The
[35:18] Headstone we're not going to our Feet's
[35:21] not going to get glorified first then
[35:23] our body I mean then our waist and then
[35:26] you see I'm talking about it's going to
[35:28] be an instant
[35:30] thing we're going to be changed in the
[35:32] moment twinkling of an eye brother BR
[35:33] said this thing right here will be saky
[35:34] till the day of the change the day of
[35:37] the change but boy when you get changed
[35:40] I'll guarantee you you can say just like
[35:42] Jesus all power and Heaven and Earth
[35:43] been given unto me cuz that's what God's
[35:44] always wanted he's not always wanted the
[35:47] power
[35:51] MH God not
[35:53] selfish remember he said Adam first
[35:55] first man he made
[35:57] hey he said Earth's
[36:01] yours you control the Earth I'll control
[36:04] Heaven what he been he's want to get
[36:06] same thing with you and I speak my word
[36:09] he's not going to come down here and
[36:10] physically speak it he's going to come
[36:12] down here and physically speak it
[36:13] through
[36:14] you all of us we need to go by the way
[36:17] yes that but that justification
[36:19] sanctification Holy Ghost and that
[36:21] headstone is that after um Mount
[36:25] Transfiguration that is correct this is
[36:29] you cannot you cannot see this without
[36:31] being
[36:32] adopted no
[36:34] way you're you're still down here you're
[36:37] still here and what I'm saying is you're
[36:39] in a
[36:40] position adoption is not down here
[36:42] adopting is why brother bradam and Lord
[36:44] Jesus are only two people that I know
[36:46] were adopted even Paul wasn't adopted
[36:48] cuz there was things that he didn't see
[36:50] but when you come up to here when
[36:52] brother Ram went out to Arizona he said
[36:54] he said God will take you what go to on
[36:56] the back out of a desert visit you with
[36:57] an angel give you something for the
[36:59] people well that's exactly what happened
[37:01] in Arizona God took him up a mountain
[37:04] Vis him with seven angels give him a
[37:07] message and said here ye him and he put
[37:08] that sign in the sky the one with the
[37:11] with the cloud at the
[37:13] confirmation cuz Jesus told him them two
[37:15] angels said hey you see the son of man
[37:18] leaving he said in the cloud he said
[37:20] he's coming back in the same way right
[37:23] and Matthew he says he said why you
[37:25] looking up he said that same Jesus who
[37:28] just went up you going to see him right
[37:29] back down here on Earth again but he's
[37:30] going to be hidden his people the world
[37:32] will see me no more but you'll see me
[37:34] cuz I'll be with you even in until the
[37:35] end the world get out of
[37:37] here
