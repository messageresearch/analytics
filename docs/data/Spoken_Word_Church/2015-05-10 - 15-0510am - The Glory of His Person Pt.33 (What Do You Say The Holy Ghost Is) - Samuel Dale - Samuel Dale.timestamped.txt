[22:46] 1 and then we'll go to
[22:50] Ephesians and I turn to see the voice
[22:53] that spake with me in being turned I saw
[22:54] seven golden candlesticks in the midst
[22:57] of the seven candlesticks one like unto
[22:59] the son of man clothed with a garment
[23:01] down to the foot and G about the PPS
[23:03] with a golden girdle his head and his
[23:05] hairs were white like wool as white as
[23:08] snow and his eyes were as a flame as of
[23:12] were as a flame of fire and his feet
[23:15] like undefined brce as if they burned in
[23:18] a furnace and his voice as the sound of
[23:21] many Waters now let's go over to
[23:24] Ephesians to just use this scripture
[23:26] today in what we're thinking on we'll
[23:29] read uh
[23:32] 1-4 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by
[23:35] the will of God to the Saints which are
[23:36] at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ
[23:39] Jesus now remember this is to the Saints
[23:41] in Ephesus but it means to the Saints
[23:44] the bride of Christ all the way through
[23:46] right so this is speaking to us Grace be
[23:49] to you and be to you and peace from God
[23:52] our Father and from the Lord Jesus
[23:56] Christ blessed be the God and Father
[23:58] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha
[24:00] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[24:02] in Heavenly places in Christ according
[24:06] as he has chosen Us in him before the
[24:08] foundation of the world that we should
[24:10] be ho and Without Blame before him in
[24:12] love having predestinated us unto the
[24:15] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[24:18] himself according to the good pleasure
[24:20] of his will to the praise of the glory
[24:23] of his grace wherein he hath made us
[24:25] accepted in the Beloved in whom we have
[24:28] Redemption through his blood the
[24:30] Forgiveness of sins according to the
[24:32] riches of his grace wherein he hath B
[24:35] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[24:38] Prudence Prudence having made known unto
[24:41] us the mystery of his will according to
[24:44] his good pleasure which he have purpose
[24:46] in himself that in the dispensation of
[24:48] the fullness of times he might gather
[24:50] together in one all things in Christ
[24:53] both which are in heaven and which are
[24:56] on earth even in him
[24:58] in whom also we have obtained an
[25:01] inheritance being predestinated
[25:03] according to the purpose of him who
[25:05] worketh all things after the counsel of
[25:08] his own will that we should be to the
[25:10] praise of his glory who first trusted in
[25:13] Christ in whom ye also trusted after
[25:16] that you heard the word of Truth The
[25:19] Gospel of your salvation in whom also
[25:22] after that you believed you were sealed
[25:26] with that Holy Spirit of of promise now
[25:29] notice what it said you were sealed with
[25:32] that it this doesn't say see we quote it
[25:35] a lot of times sealed with the Holy
[25:36] Spirit but look at the emphasis we
[25:39] sealed with that I put a big circle
[25:42] around mine a long time ago and wrote
[25:44] New Birth okay and uh uh the Holy Spirit
[25:48] of Promise which is the earnest of our
[25:49] inheritance until the Redemption of The
[25:52] purchas Possession unto the praise of
[25:54] his glory you may be seated the Lord had
[25:57] his Blessing to the reading of the word
[26:00] now one more scripture to as we hope
[26:04] we'll get to
[26:05] it as Ephesians
[26:08] 4:30 says grieve not the Holy Spirit
[26:11] whereby you're sealed unto the day of
[26:14] your
[26:15] Redemption all right now we have been
[26:19] speaking for quite a while on the new
[26:23] birth and I want to continue on this and
[26:27] if it gets kind of boring take you a
[26:29] vacation come back in a couple of weeks
[26:31] and pick up and we'll go on you know
[26:34] whatever is
[26:35] doing it's not a joke you know I'm just
[26:40] saying that we will still be on this for
[26:42] quite a while because I want to make
[26:44] sure you understand what I'm saying
[26:49] whether you believe it or not that's
[26:51] between you and God I cannot reveal
[26:54] anything all right and and even Jesus
[26:57] said my own life didn't reveal it so
[27:00] then we're going to have to depend on
[27:01] the holy spirit so if you don't have the
[27:03] Holy
[27:04] Spirit as the new birth then you don't
[27:07] have an inside teacher and if you don't
[27:09] have the inside teacher how can you know
[27:12] anything because we'll get to that
[27:14] eventually in the message today I hope
[27:17] that there's no way you can understand
[27:19] Jesus being the Christ except it be by
[27:22] the New Birth by the Born Again
[27:25] experience you're just saying what
[27:27] somebody else says all right but now
[27:31] what have we been dealing
[27:32] with now we've been talking about the
[27:36] New
[27:37] Birth all
[27:41] right and we've been dealing with the
[27:43] one thing that I believe and
[27:45] wholeheartedly have for you know ever
[27:47] since I saw it in the message and we
[27:49] came in message quite a while
[27:53] ago and uh I believe that the new birth
[27:56] is the birth of the word
[27:59] amen all right now but I say to you
[28:03] because I know what our thinking is in
[28:06] our minds when you say New Birth born
[28:10] again um whatever the terminologies
[28:13] you're going to be used on that and you
[28:16] ask the people cuz I originally put the
[28:19] title uh like this but I changed it but
[28:22] I put the title what do you call the New
[28:25] Birth what do you think about the new
[28:27] birth
[28:28] all right what is the new
[28:31] birth see and you ask people say what is
[28:34] the new birth and they'll automatically
[28:35] tell you something they
[28:38] done right I mean it it'll come as an
[28:42] automatic process this what do you
[28:44] believe the new birth is and it'll just
[28:47] be I shouted I spoke in tongues I cried
[28:49] I
[28:50] done that is not the new birth am if you
[28:54] don't get nothing out of the message
[28:56] please get that into your mind and
[28:59] thinking that's like a
[29:01] baby it don't you can't hear the baby
[29:04] cry until it comes from the mother's
[29:06] wound and life comes within the
[29:09] body the baby coming is supposed to be
[29:12] the
[29:13] birth all right and so we're looking at
[29:16] the things that we call the
[29:19] attributes crying shouting speaking I
[29:22] believe in every bit of
[29:23] that see that's where when you start
[29:25] laying down hard on something people are
[29:28] he don't believe in
[29:30] that well all right I can't determine
[29:33] what you believe I can just keep saying
[29:35] I believe it I believe in all kind of
[29:39] signs and wonders and manifestations of
[29:41] the Holy Spirit and I I do not believe
[29:44] that and I'm going to say it the way
[29:46] that I mean it I believe every person in
[29:48] the world that has had the New Birth has
[29:51] had the same new birth right am now I
[29:54] want you to show me where that would be
[29:56] wrong right
[29:59] see now don't jump back in Luther them
[30:01] because we'll get to it this evening and
[30:02] something but don't jump back there and
[30:03] start trying to make them have a little
[30:05] bit and that's a whole
[30:09] lot that justification was the new birth
[30:13] right of their day are they're not in
[30:15] the body of Christ so now you're the one
[30:17] taking them out it's not me in in trying
[30:20] to express it to you but
[30:23] see every person because every baby
[30:26] that's born natural L now now we're in
[30:29] the day of you know the cians of this
[30:33] you know and all but every baby that is
[30:36] natural born baby is born the same way
[30:40] may be in a pink decorated hospital as
[30:42] the prophet said or maybe on a you know
[30:46] a lot of times now babies are born on
[30:48] airplanes they're born on trains or
[30:50] they're born on in you know ships and
[30:53] and everything all kind of things as
[30:55] places as it's been but yet it's still
[30:58] the same
[31:00] birth it's still what water
[31:03] breaks blood comes the baby
[31:07] comes you know I mean they tried to
[31:10] scientifically make everything to be so
[31:12] great but you just can't bypass none of
[31:15] them things
[31:16] right because they're going to be there
[31:19] right so then why don't you think about
[31:21] everybody that ever received a new birth
[31:24] is like everybody that received a
[31:26] natural birth normal natural
[31:30] birth they're born the same right right
[31:34] all right see then that way you can get
[31:37] down to something that would should make
[31:40] it easier for you to understand because
[31:43] you're not dealing with
[31:45] 969 plus 2,000 in the message of
[31:48] different ideas about what the new birth
[31:50] is remember we took that a few weeks
[31:55] ago how can the New Birth be according
[31:57] to
[31:58] to thousands of
[32:02] interpretations
[32:05] no see that's where it's messed up at
[32:09] right that's where the people don't
[32:11] believe it correctly according to the
[32:12] Bible they don't believe it's the birth
[32:14] of the
[32:17] word well if it's not the birth of the
[32:19] word what is
[32:22] it well I shouted I cried
[32:26] see but you put the things of of what
[32:31] the baby does when it gets
[32:33] here no just get the baby
[32:37] here you know then whatever it is then
[32:41] you can say well the day I receive the
[32:42] Holy Ghost I shout it well I'll agree
[32:45] with you then you said the day I
[32:47] received the new birth I I just cried I
[32:51] I I I just had this weeping feeling or I
[32:54] just sat there with a sweetness about me
[32:56] and I'll agree with every one one of
[32:58] them as being outward
[33:02] manifestations of something that has
[33:05] taken place inside of
[33:08] you then we'll go along and we all have
[33:11] the new birth in the right order what is
[33:13] this so much trouble about the new birth
[33:15] I don't understand that I never have I
[33:17] don't I don't get
[33:19] it well you're just too stubborn to
[33:22] agree with this about well that may be
[33:24] true just pray for me all right but you
[33:29] come and show me anything
[33:32] different than it being the birth of the
[33:35] word because I thought we read the other
[33:38] day we talking about where Jesus said in
[33:40] the parable what so went forth to S and
[33:43] etc etc and he
[33:45] said he SED the seed and he said and in
[33:49] the bible let think where was it in Luke
[33:51] 6 and 11 you know where we were at the
[33:54] other day and it says the the seed is
[33:57] the word of
[33:59] God well I didn't know of God having
[34:01] anything other than a word the seed
[34:03] being his word amen now if you got
[34:06] anything else on that I'd like to know
[34:07] about it but I I can't find that
[34:09] anywhere because that way it would keep
[34:11] everything
[34:12] straight all
[34:14] right but you see what did the prophet
[34:16] say that we gave we'll get to it in a
[34:18] minute what did he say he said they deny
[34:20] the birth of the word
[34:22] right well when you deny the birth of
[34:25] the word you're going to go through your
[34:26] own ideas
[34:28] so all right listen when I say new birth
[34:32] I
[34:33] cried well all right but that's the
[34:38] after
[34:39] effects that's not the
[34:41] birth that's the after effect see we
[34:44] spent all of those times now Pentecostal
[34:46] people did especially cuz us old Baptist
[34:48] and things we didn't think much about it
[34:50] but some of you Pentecostal and things
[34:52] you know you know how long it took to
[34:54] get out of you what the prophet had to
[34:55] bring that we every body wanted to read
[34:58] the Bible there in the book of Acts and
[35:00] and they had everybody speaking in
[35:04] tongues until your Prophet made the
[35:07] statement I didn't he said if you say
[35:10] you receive the Holy Ghost speaking in
[35:12] tongues he said you're contrary to the
[35:15] word
[35:17] right that's
[35:20] right I didn't say that are you offended
[35:22] at me because that the prophet said it
[35:28] see I thought we believe the prophet was
[35:31] the one to tell us what these
[35:34] were and I thought the first doctrine of
[35:37] the Lord Jesus
[35:39] Christ was what you must be born
[35:43] again I thought then when it come to The
[35:48] Parables you remember where we read it
[35:49] the other day if you don't understand
[35:51] the parable of the sewing of the seed
[35:54] you can't understand the rest of the
[35:55] Parables amen
[35:58] why because the parable of showing in
[35:59] the seed is the new
[36:01] birth so if you can't understand being
[36:03] born again you can't understand the rest
[36:05] of the parables in the Bible oh but
[36:08] brother Dale I can read them that don't
[36:10] Mount to a hell of beans that's
[36:13] right that don't mean a thing
[36:17] right if you're going to make it on a
[36:19] basis you can read it what are you going
[36:20] to do with somebody that can't
[36:24] read I'm sorry I put those things in a
[36:27] lot of times they try to get us away
[36:29] from thinking our old natural
[36:32] ways but it's true isn't it like my wife
[36:35] was talking to my my brother-in-law
[36:37] about it and he believes in tongues of
[36:38] evidence she said what about the person
[36:40] that can't
[36:41] speak right well you know he hadn't said
[36:44] another word to her since then about
[36:46] it but did it change him and did he come
[36:49] to the truth I'm not saying he won't I'm
[36:52] saying he didn't change a thing well
[36:55] because he still believes it you know
[36:57] why cuz his church teaches it
[37:01] right right
[37:04] right you see church we don't realize
[37:06] what we're holding on to in our our our
[37:10] ideas and ways from a childhood up no
[37:12] wonder the Catholic Church will say give
[37:14] me a child until it's like five or seven
[37:16] years old so you can have it the rest of
[37:17] your life and you'll never convert it I
[37:19] don't agree with them I do
[37:22] 99.9% of the that is the
[37:25] truth but I don't agree with them about
[37:27] the New Birth it will take care of that
[37:31] and the others is just a switching over
[37:33] from one doctor to another one right I
[37:35] mean you come out and be a Baptist and
[37:37] you still got the father Son and Holy
[37:38] Ghost what have you what have you
[37:40] changed you know right all right but
[37:43] look see see I ask you what is the new
[37:51] birth but you'll automatically say I
[37:54] done this or I done that that's not the
[37:57] birth
[37:57] right amen that's the after effects of
[38:00] the birth amen all right now listen see
[38:04] what the
[38:05] point if I ask you what is the new birth
[38:09] and you first thing you pull up is
[38:11] something you
[38:15] done all right
[38:18] yeah
[38:23] now I thought the new
[38:26] birth was not what we
[38:30] done I thought it was what God
[38:33] done all right now if it's your shouting
[38:36] crying etc etc if that is your new
[38:39] birth then what did God do now you're
[38:42] out of the scriptures see well what do
[38:45] you mean brother Dale uh Abraham
[38:48] believed God it was imputed unto his
[38:50] righteousness
[38:51] amen but what did God
[38:54] do God gave Abraham the sign of circum
[38:57] cision as a type of the baptism of the
[39:00] Holy Ghost
[39:03] right see now you see you're not you're
[39:06] not staying in the
[39:08] word all right see if the natural birth
[39:12] is a type of the spiritual birth then in
[39:15] the natural birth the seed was
[39:17] planted into the
[39:20] wound and then it came forth the
[39:23] processes of doing and and all through
[39:26] the the nine months
[39:28] and then the the the water
[39:31] breaks the the blood comes and then the
[39:35] baby comes into the world and the baby
[39:38] comes
[39:40] alive all
[39:41] right see then the natural
[39:45] birth it consists of water blood and
[39:48] life all right so the spiritual
[39:53] birth consists of those things
[39:56] justification
[39:58] sanctification and the baptism of the
[40:00] Holy Ghost amen that's right all right
[40:03] see all
[40:04] right see then it is the birth of the
[40:07] word or seed that was planted into your
[40:12] soul that the spirit of God can give
[40:15] life to the word that was shown in
[40:20] you all right
[40:23] now remember this point
[40:27] I've got it in every message and I got
[40:29] it colored run across there to make sure
[40:32] if you'll see them light ones that means
[40:34] I can skip them because they're not as
[40:37] important but when it's got the oranger
[40:39] looking that's one I got to express
[40:44] okay now watch you are not born again in
[40:47] your body that's right amen you are not
[40:50] born again in your
[40:53] spirit all
[40:55] right the new birth takes place in the
[41:00] soul all
[41:02] right so then it's
[41:05] justification
[41:07] sanctification and the baptism of the
[41:09] Holy Ghost our new
[41:11] birth as being in your soul
[41:16] right because you're not born again in
[41:18] your body you're not born again in your
[41:19] spirit
[41:21] right that only displays outwardly what
[41:26] has taken place in inwardly now watch in
[41:28] a minute where we get to that quote
[41:29] where the Prophet said he said see
[41:31] there's not too many new BS then that's
[41:34] right I didn't make the statement he was
[41:36] the one that done
[41:37] it but
[41:40] listen brother randam we gave it there
[41:42] the other
[41:43] day paragraph 44 of souls in prison we
[41:47] won't pull that up you know but he says
[41:50] it like this he said that soul is what
[41:53] God is working on right amen
[41:58] now as I went through it with a drawing
[42:01] so you would not have nothing to be able
[42:03] to argue about sure you're listening to
[42:07] what someone
[42:08] says and Faith cometh by hearing hearing
[42:11] by the word all right now so that has to
[42:14] come through the outward senses see tast
[42:17] fi smell here see all right then there's
[42:21] a memory reason conscience affections
[42:24] Etc as to the spirit part of man and
[42:27] that God has to deal through those
[42:29] things amen because that's the way he's
[42:32] contacting
[42:34] us but he's not giving birth to your old
[42:37] caste field smell and here he's not
[42:40] giving birth to your memory reason
[42:42] conscious affections that's the things
[42:44] that have got to be cleaned
[42:46] out he's giving birth to the
[42:49] word amen that you
[42:52] heard and like I said now where you
[42:55] won't run it all but I didn't hear
[42:57] nobody I was I was just sitting out
[42:59] under a tree and the Holy Ghost fell on
[43:01] praise the
[43:02] Lord but remember you heard it from
[43:04] somebody if you read the Bible you heard
[43:06] it from somebody so don't go with that
[43:09] junk all right I I'm sorry I'm I I try
[43:14] not to be too
[43:16] arrogant but you know I I like what
[43:19] brother brandham said one day too he
[43:22] said if you make it soft he said they'll
[43:24] think you're trying to pull something
[43:26] over on them
[43:29] all right so at least you know I'm not
[43:31] trying to pull anything over on you you
[43:33] know I'm just trying my best to express
[43:37] what I see right amen all right and then
[43:40] it's up to you between you and God for
[43:43] to see what that is because we'll get to
[43:46] it the Lord willing this afternoon see
[43:47] you got to have your own personal
[43:49] experience
[43:52] amen my wife wonderful we're we're a
[43:55] husband wife but she can't her
[43:57] experience is not my
[44:01] experience she could have a genuine
[44:03] experience and me not have a genuine
[44:07] one see it's not only because you're
[44:09] born kin folks or
[44:11] somebody now watch this this afternoon
[44:14] when we pick up something as a little
[44:17] deeper
[44:18] thought but we will bring it out this
[44:21] morning and just stop and then this
[44:23] afternoon we'll carry it a little bit
[44:25] further
[44:27] see then
[44:29] justification see we believe in
[44:31] justification sanctification the baptism
[44:33] of the Holy Ghost as to be the new birth
[44:35] Amen in the days of Martin Luther now I
[44:38] want to express this where you'll think
[44:40] about it the days of Martin Luther they
[44:42] taught the just shall live by faith but
[44:44] was that all he
[44:48] [Music]
[44:51] knowed was was that
[44:54] all no but it was a birth right and what
[44:58] was the birth
[45:02] of the new birth to Luther was a just
[45:05] shall live by faith you agree with that
[45:07] all
[45:09] right but now we got a little bit this
[45:11] afternoon we want to
[45:13] cover because remember Martin Luther was
[45:15] a Believer
[45:20] before he received
[45:24] justification John Wesley was a believer
[45:27] of Luther's
[45:30] message before he received the message
[45:33] of
[45:34] sanctification so we're not just playing
[45:37] with
[45:39] words we're trying to express something
[45:42] see in justification we read from the
[45:44] future home it chops off your past sins
[45:48] says it does nothing to your nature does
[45:50] nothing to you except what forgive your
[45:54] sins all right
[45:58] then
[46:01] sanctification is the driving out of the
[46:03] unclean
[46:07] Spirit cleansing The
[46:11] Vessel sanctifying it setting it aside
[46:15] in order to be used cleansing
[46:21] it it's the cleansing of the nature of
[46:26] your soul
[46:30] right sanctification is a cleansing of
[46:33] the nature of your soul right it's not a
[46:35] white wash in of the
[46:36] soul I still don't believe and I'm going
[46:38] to get on it more and more to to where
[46:41] we we'll we'll Hammer until we get it or
[46:43] you'll you'll quit coming or do
[46:45] something cuz I'm going to hammer it
[46:46] about the soul until you see it and this
[46:48] is 40 something years I've been doing it
[46:50] so it don't matter about me to take 40
[46:52] more if I'm alive that
[46:55] long because I don't believe that most
[46:59] people know what a soul
[47:00] is Right amen I got it written in here
[47:04] in a minute and I'll get
[47:06] it if you think the soul is just the
[47:08] nature of the
[47:13] spirit you just trapped yourself you
[47:16] said that's what the prophet said
[47:18] amen but he knowed what he's talking
[47:21] about but if you say the soul is just
[47:24] the nature of the spirit there is no
[47:26] quote for it first to say the soul is
[47:28] just the nature of the spirit it's the
[47:30] soul is the nature of the spirit you
[47:32] added the word just to it the two Soul
[47:34] people did years ago and it's become a
[47:36] Doctrine all
[47:39] right but I want you to think about this
[47:42] if you think it's just the nature of
[47:44] something that that's what your soul is
[47:46] then what's the nature
[47:49] of
[47:52] uhoh we just made another step
[47:55] somewhere do do you understand what I
[47:58] mean if you say it's just the nature
[48:01] then what is it the nature
[48:09] of meaning whatever it is is more real
[48:12] than just the
[48:13] nature you
[48:16] agree think of that we'll drop back in a
[48:18] minute on
[48:20] it
[48:22] see so
[48:24] sanctification is a cleansing of the the
[48:26] nature of the
[48:29] Soul now remember how we tried to
[48:31] express and we'll say this a little bit
[48:32] about it when you started is a
[48:36] baby just a baby in the Cradle first
[48:39] thing you do the eyes you don't even
[48:41] know about it and all like that but it's
[48:42] still all in all that mechanical parts
[48:45] we call brains and things and uh the
[48:48] poor little baby starts out and the
[48:49] nurse is cussing and the doctor's
[48:51] cussing and they're rip snorting and
[48:53] running all over the place and all kind
[48:55] of things going on poor little thing
[48:57] starts off that way
[49:00] right and all of his
[49:03] life that little fell is being a nature
[49:06] is being
[49:07] molded within the in that little
[49:12] baby and that nature is what your soul
[49:17] is all of its life that little nature is
[49:20] molding within it why can't you see that
[49:23] as being the soul
[49:28] [Music]
[49:30] then in the
[49:34] sanctification see all of your life
[49:36] you've been raised and trained and done
[49:40] and taught and you go to school and and
[49:43] you get into the schools and what are
[49:45] they teaching now Heaven helped the poor
[49:47] kids you know what's being taught even
[49:50] by the
[49:51] schools of the systems and things you
[49:55] know and then even you say well well
[49:57] that's why I homeschool well you still
[50:00] take the material you got to take the
[50:02] material for somebody to give you cuz
[50:03] you ain't going to get
[50:05] credit you ain't going to get credit to
[50:07] say just take it up when they get up to
[50:09] whatever age they get up to the top and
[50:11] they say I homeschool my kids well what
[50:14] program did you I use my own and they
[50:17] say you need to go back and start over
[50:20] right no am I
[50:23] true you do the best you can choosing
[50:25] them but they're still going to have
[50:27] their slant and their
[50:31] idea until the child has no
[50:35] hopes we see sanctification then doesn't
[50:38] drive the soul
[50:43] out it drives out the nature of the Soul
[50:47] if the soul went out remember we gave
[50:48] the quotes the prophet said you're a tri
[50:50] being and he said without any of these
[50:53] you're not a being right right do you
[50:57] remember
[50:59] that see you say well my old soul went
[51:02] out go back and check the tapes and the
[51:05] things check the quote from your prophet
[51:07] and watch him being referring to the
[51:09] second realm which is the spirit
[51:12] real all
[51:15] right see the nature of the
[51:19] soul the prophet says on page 36 souls
[51:22] in
[51:25] prison he says the the nature of
[51:28] your soul is
[51:30] God if you're born
[51:34] again look at the very expression now
[51:37] bring it back down to where we just read
[51:39] the whole
[51:41] thing this is paragraph
[51:43] 36 souls in prison now the soul of man
[51:47] is not the body of man it's the souls
[51:49] and the soul is something that's the the
[51:51] nature of the spirit amen that's right
[51:54] because it displays from inside out
[51:56] whether you're saved or lost it's coming
[51:59] from the inside out okay now
[52:03] what the nature and then when the nature
[52:06] of man when he said we are dead the
[52:09] scripture plainly tells us we are dead
[52:11] and our lives are HID in God through
[52:13] Christ sealed are by the Holy
[52:16] Spirit now it wasn't your body died it
[52:20] wasn't your spirit
[52:22] died you talking about the new birth
[52:25] right it was the nature of your spirit
[52:27] died see the nature which is the
[52:32] soul now did the soul
[52:37] die he just explained that the body
[52:40] didn't die he's just explained that the
[52:42] spirit didn't
[52:45] die well is is the soul that
[52:48] dies well it looks like it is well then
[52:51] you got a lot of problems with other
[52:53] things
[52:57] so you're not seeing the real you of
[52:59] what it
[53:02] is the nature of your soul is God if
[53:05] you're born
[53:07] again if
[53:08] not it's of the
[53:11] world all
[53:13] right so now it's not the body that dies
[53:17] it's not the spirit that dies it's not
[53:19] the soul that
[53:20] dies it's the
[53:23] nature of that soul
[53:27] that must
[53:28] die in the new
[53:31] birth and to be made alive with the
[53:34] nature of
[53:38] Christ
[53:40] okay all right
[53:43] then see now what is a
[53:47] soul we gave it when you must be born
[53:50] again you are a
[53:52] soul the part that's inside of you
[53:56] your
[54:01] soul now remember I go through it a lot
[54:03] I keep saying it it doesn't say the body
[54:05] that sinth and the spirit that sinth it
[54:07] says the soul that sinth it shall die so
[54:09] then the Soul is more real than any of
[54:11] other yet we like to look at the body we
[54:12] even talk about the spirit but we even
[54:15] consider the soul fact of being more
[54:17] real than the rest of us you know as far
[54:20] as Body Spirit
[54:27] and remember it's the soul that's made
[54:28] in the image of God not the body and
[54:34] spirit all right what do we be We
[54:37] Believe
[54:39] then see it was the
[54:42] nature of your spirit that
[54:47] died whatever was motivating that in the
[54:51] directions that was
[54:53] going that part has to
[54:56] die all right whatever is motivating the
[55:00] soul and may I go back to the quote I
[55:03] said a moment ago if you think that the
[55:05] soul is just the nature of the spirit
[55:09] then all right that means the spirit's
[55:11] more real than the
[55:12] soul so now you trapped your own self
[55:15] because something else has got to be
[55:17] motivating it for it to have a nature
[55:20] right so we better get down to the
[55:22] center part of us and start from there
[55:25] in the new birth right and then we don't
[55:29] have to worry about the
[55:30] anointings we don't have to worry about
[55:32] all of the I cried I die you'll find out
[55:35] what the New Birth really
[55:37] is all
[55:42] right and here's that one I got the
[55:44] question I wrote a
[55:47] question see we think the soul is just
[55:49] the nature of
[55:51] something all right then what is the
[55:53] something that has the nature
[55:57] say that again see we think that the
[55:59] soul is just the nature of something
[56:02] it's the nature of the spirit it's just
[56:04] well all right what is the something
[56:06] that is the
[56:09] nature what's causing the soul to be
[56:13] what it is that's
[56:15] right
[56:17] right see you trap your own self by
[56:21] trying to think out
[56:23] things instead of listening to the
[56:25] prophet
[56:27] the nature of your soul is God if you're
[56:30] born again if not it's of the world that
[56:33] solves a problem we there either one or
[56:35] the other there's not a gray area in
[56:38] this new birth that's right all right so
[56:41] either one or the other it's either what
[56:42] did he say faith or doubt he said it's
[56:46] either God or the devil right all right
[56:51] so now the
[56:53] soul see truly it does have enough
[57:00] nature because that's what I was talking
[57:03] about the soul of that baby when it was
[57:06] born into the world the nature started
[57:09] being
[57:10] molded into what it is
[57:12] today and whatever you let it be molded
[57:15] in them just
[57:17] remember well I I can't do nothing with
[57:19] my kids because you know they they're
[57:22] they're they want their own nature well
[57:24] until they get up so far then mine
[57:26] always wanted my
[57:30] nature and it had a little Hickory on
[57:33] the end of
[57:35] it that made sure they got the idea
[57:39] correctly of what the nature was wanted
[57:42] don't you want your kids to do
[57:44] right does that solve the problems of
[57:47] what we are but yet we say let them go
[57:49] let them go no you don't let a child go
[57:52] uh-uh now you can think all you want to
[57:54] you can say brother Dale's wrong there
[57:57] I don't have to argue no point with it
[57:59] cuz you're going to find out when the
[58:00] nature of that child comes out down the
[58:02] road and pulls a gun on you and say I'm
[58:05] going to blow your head off if you don't
[58:06] give me some
[58:09] money you're right then going to think
[58:11] boy I wish I'd have whipped you when you
[58:12] was
[58:16] little
[58:18] right and don't believe in in you know
[58:22] child abuse no way no way I do believe
[58:26] what the Bible says the Bible says beat
[58:29] a child it won't
[58:31] die Spire the rod spoil the
[58:38] child I never have understood how that
[58:42] little Hickory down on that bottom made
[58:44] that head think different but it
[58:47] did it might not have converted the
[58:49] child but the child didn't act like that
[58:52] around
[58:53] you right right
[58:56] you got the attention all right now but
[59:00] watch
[59:01] now see then we used them last week
[59:05] we've used them a couple of times where
[59:07] brother randam said it like this on you
[59:10] must be born again paragraph 129
[59:13] 61231 false prophets brings what false
[59:19] birth true prophets bring
[59:26] the word the birth of the
[59:29] word
[59:33] Christ now I believe brother random
[59:35] tried to bring us the birth of the word
[59:37] don't you now you ain't got to the point
[59:41] yet what I'm getting at but that's all
[59:43] right we just move along a little
[59:45] bit and we'll get it one of these days
[59:48] and then you'll say wait a minute that's
[59:49] what he's been talking about all right
[59:52] we went to the spoken words Original
[59:54] Seed paragraph 151 he said the birth of
[59:57] the word is
[1:00:01] Christ all
[1:00:03] right paragraph 76 and 77 of birth pains
[1:00:09] they have that one you can pull it up is
[1:00:10] number four because we got a number that
[1:00:14] goes with it but he says that's why
[1:00:17] there's not too
[1:00:19] many rather genuine new
[1:00:24] births let's read that we know the old
[1:00:27] seed is must before the new seed can
[1:00:31] come out of the old seed it must rot
[1:00:34] absolutely not die only but rot after
[1:00:38] it's dead we know that to be
[1:00:41] true that's the same thing in the New
[1:00:45] Birth we never go back but we go forward
[1:00:49] when you're born again and that's why I
[1:00:51] think today we have so many now watch
[1:00:54] him not so many rather genuine new
[1:01:02] births why is because the seed is
[1:01:06] maybe will sympathize with the
[1:01:11] word or the
[1:01:13] person but they don't ride away from the
[1:01:16] old system that they were in they don't
[1:01:19] want to come out of it they want to stay
[1:01:22] in the old system watch and claim the
[1:01:24] new birth are the message of the
[1:01:27] age and we'll get back to that little
[1:01:29] quote in a deeper meaning uh we found
[1:01:32] that under Luther west of Pentecost and
[1:01:35] all the other ages they still try to
[1:01:37] hold on to the old system and claim this
[1:01:40] but the old system age must die right in
[1:01:43] order to bring forth the new one they
[1:01:46] still want to cllean right all
[1:01:51] right what did he go on as we were given
[1:01:53] last Sunday as a seed's not air with a
[1:01:55] shu paragraph 144 they deny the birth of
[1:02:00] the
[1:02:02] word now truly we can see that the
[1:02:07] denominations want their
[1:02:09] part and the things to hold to their
[1:02:11] doctrines and their ideas and their
[1:02:13] situations and
[1:02:16] whatever but they're going to hold on to
[1:02:19] that
[1:02:20] idea and they won't rot away to their
[1:02:23] own ideas
[1:02:26] and thereby they're not getting the
[1:02:28] birth of the word well are you saying
[1:02:30] them people's not saved I don't say
[1:02:32] nobody's not saved that's right I've
[1:02:35] never said that I don't even say the
[1:02:36] pope of Rome's not saved that's between
[1:02:38] him and
[1:02:39] God he wouldn't do no good for me to say
[1:02:42] he wasn't saved or he
[1:02:45] was either way it wouldn't change him
[1:02:48] right so then don't get that idea amen
[1:02:52] well you think you're the only one got
[1:02:53] the new birth I'm the only one that I
[1:02:54] know's got it right right that's right
[1:02:56] now you better deal with yourself that's
[1:02:58] right because if not you're saying what
[1:03:00] somebody else says right come on you can
[1:03:02] say brother brandham had it I agree with
[1:03:04] you I believe that but that don't save
[1:03:07] me right that's right that's saying what
[1:03:11] somebody else says and that won't save
[1:03:12] you that's right you got to have your
[1:03:14] own
[1:03:15] experience all
[1:03:16] right see then If you deny the
[1:03:22] word any part of the word how can you
[1:03:25] how the birth of the
[1:03:27] word that a simple
[1:03:31] question well brother de agree with
[1:03:33] everything in the word except one
[1:03:37] thing well no God can't give you a new
[1:03:40] birth right now if you change that
[1:03:43] around in a way of saying you mean we
[1:03:45] got to have know all about the word I
[1:03:47] didn't say
[1:03:49] that I said if you say I agree with all
[1:03:52] the word except one thing you said it I
[1:03:55] didn't
[1:03:57] if you say I don't understand all of the
[1:04:00] word God can give you the birth of
[1:04:04] what you do understand right in the days
[1:04:08] of Martin Luther we talk about it
[1:04:11] trinitarian sitting in a pub drinking
[1:04:14] beer smoking a pipe well God gave him
[1:04:17] the new birth right
[1:04:19] amen you know what his new birth was not
[1:04:22] the seals not the plagues the vials of
[1:04:24] trumpets right what was the new birth to
[1:04:26] Luther the just shall live by faith
[1:04:29] amen right
[1:04:32] yes all
[1:04:34] right see there's something wrong with
[1:04:37] the planting of the
[1:04:40] seed is where the trouble's at that was
[1:04:43] the
[1:04:44] parable even if planted correctly in The
[1:04:49] Parables you would come out with the
[1:04:51] people deciding that you know the cares
[1:04:54] of Life the this out of the other not
[1:04:57] understanding or doing a thing something
[1:04:59] took them away from the real
[1:05:01] understanding that is even the genuine
[1:05:03] planning of the word of God don't you
[1:05:05] believe the disciples that God planted
[1:05:07] the word in them pure and
[1:05:09] unadulterated come on that's right we'll
[1:05:12] get to it in a minute where he's seen a
[1:05:14] 500 Brethren but only 120 of them got it
[1:05:17] in the upper room right amen all right y
[1:05:22] see that's
[1:05:23] Bible all right but look Luke 8 11 says
[1:05:29] the seed is the word of God
[1:05:33] right all
[1:05:36] right now see if the seed is not planted
[1:05:42] correctly pure and
[1:05:44] [Music]
[1:05:46] unadulterated by your own doings of
[1:05:49] rejecting
[1:05:51] it and saying I don't believe that
[1:05:56] now are you listening I'm putting that
[1:05:57] the way that I'm saying it you say I
[1:06:00] don't believe that then how can you say
[1:06:03] you got the new birth
[1:06:06] right well you're trying to tell me I
[1:06:08] ain't born again hey I'm glad you
[1:06:11] finally called home what I'm talking
[1:06:16] about remember my way of saying
[1:06:20] things if I knew all I had to do was
[1:06:23] just to say one thing wait and he'd
[1:06:26] leave well you know what if I knew he's
[1:06:30] going to leave I just might as well say
[1:06:31] it to him now and let him get up walk
[1:06:34] out that's right I'm not going to back
[1:06:36] up on what I
[1:06:38] say I'm just going to leave it that way
[1:06:41] amen and say what I
[1:06:43] believe because that way then you can
[1:06:45] differ whatever you want to do with it
[1:06:48] it's up to
[1:06:49] you but see get what I'm saying how can
[1:06:52] you deny the word and it be the birth of
[1:06:55] the word that you claim you
[1:06:58] got now may I go through spoken word is
[1:07:00] Original Seed in a Flash which took
[1:07:03] Prophet 6 hours to preach it but can I
[1:07:05] sum it up in one little word or
[1:07:08] two that's why them
[1:07:11] denominations cannot accept all of the
[1:07:19] word is that summing up the spoken word
[1:07:23] original now let me bring bring it on
[1:07:26] down then the from the N the 990 of them
[1:07:30] or 69 or something how about the 2000 in
[1:07:33] the
[1:07:36] message that claimed the prophet's
[1:07:41] message now Heaven helped now for me to
[1:07:44] ever get in the pull pit and claim
[1:07:45] brother random was a prophet and I
[1:07:47] plainly can read where he says that you
[1:07:51] don't get a New
[1:07:53] Soul well let me say it correctly where
[1:07:55] to go you
[1:07:58] you how dare me
[1:08:01] say that I have the birth of the
[1:08:05] word and deny the
[1:08:08] word especially this prophet's
[1:08:14] words just like one man says after all
[1:08:17] brother around and said it's not
[1:08:19] replacement so you drop this book pick
[1:08:21] up another
[1:08:24] book but he plainly teaches and a very
[1:08:27] popular man among the message that you
[1:08:30] got to get a new
[1:08:36] body and quot spread around him more
[1:08:38] than I
[1:08:43] do now you know I don't understand
[1:08:47] that I don't understand the people of
[1:08:50] the message today that can say that
[1:08:52] Jesus wasn't God until the River Jordan
[1:08:54] and he just a man then he become God and
[1:08:56] then God left him he died a man
[1:08:59] and I don't understand that
[1:09:03] right but yet quoting brother
[1:09:10] brandham
[1:09:13] right see if the seed is not
[1:09:17] planted
[1:09:19] correctly how can you expect the Holy
[1:09:23] Spirit to do anything other than anoint
[1:09:27] the spirit of the
[1:09:31] individual that's
[1:09:33] right we agree with that don't we that
[1:09:35] it can come down and anoint your spirit
[1:09:37] and you're still lost well how come you
[1:09:41] lost come
[1:09:44] on how come the Bible said Jesus was
[1:09:46] seen of over 500
[1:09:48] Brethren after the
[1:09:51] resurrection but yet he's only 120 my
[1:09:54] death for room well went on vacation
[1:09:56] that's a good time to take
[1:09:59] one that's pretty well like me I said
[1:10:01] okay now next Sunday I'm going to
[1:10:03] explain something and I want everybody
[1:10:05] to be Brother D I ain't going to get to
[1:10:06] make it well I wouldn't care if the
[1:10:08] world shut down
[1:10:13] right you
[1:10:15] know I wouldn't care if the world shut
[1:10:17] down and you tell me I need to be here I
[1:10:21] I'll be
[1:10:22] here you say no
[1:10:26] I know you're going to get upset when I
[1:10:28] say it but go ahead Let the dead bury
[1:10:30] the dead
[1:10:33] right I didn't say
[1:10:38] that you say you believe all the Bible I
[1:10:42] didn't say that the Bible did amen yes
[1:10:48] sir and you as a matter of fact it was
[1:10:51] the one of the god of the Bible that
[1:10:53] said it you know and says now lay down
[1:10:55] all them things let the dead bury the
[1:10:57] dead and come follow me now you know
[1:11:00] brother Dale now you you talk all you
[1:11:02] want to you do all you want to but you
[1:11:04] know one thing in the in finality where
[1:11:06] I stand I'm not saying for you not to go
[1:11:08] to funerals and go to Mamas and go to
[1:11:10] this and go to that no that's your
[1:11:12] business I'm just asking you which is
[1:11:14] the most
[1:11:21] important that's all I'm asking
[1:11:25] make you upset at me because I just ask
[1:11:27] you that question which is the most
[1:11:32] important
[1:11:40] okay see the seed is the word of God
[1:11:44] Amen if the natural seed is not planted
[1:11:49] correctly into a woman what
[1:11:53] happens you heard what you call the tube
[1:11:58] pregnancies right that can happen right
[1:12:02] the seed can actually go into the tube
[1:12:04] and actually um be fertilized and can
[1:12:08] actually start growing but it won't
[1:12:11] bring forth cuz it's not in the
[1:12:15] wound all
[1:12:16] right so in the
[1:12:19] spiritual see it must be planted
[1:12:22] correctly that's the parable now don't
[1:12:25] go into your Parable and try to
[1:12:26] straighten it all out just because it
[1:12:28] says some bring 20 some bring 40 some
[1:12:32] bring
[1:12:34] 100% or something like that you know cuz
[1:12:36] that's in the parable or don't think
[1:12:39] that that 20 is just a little part
[1:12:42] this and this no no it's not explaining
[1:12:45] the
[1:12:48] parts it's Untold you the
[1:12:52] seed because some of it according our
[1:12:55] word can only produce 20 but what word
[1:12:58] we know that's what I'm talking about of
[1:13:00] Martin
[1:13:01] Luther only he could bring forth which
[1:13:03] just shall live by
[1:13:05] faith comparing him to the day of the
[1:13:08] amount of work he'd be 20 this day would
[1:13:11] be 100 right don't get into them things
[1:13:15] and think you're so super
[1:13:19] religious you're destroying the word of
[1:13:22] God but even though the word is
[1:13:29] planted what does it
[1:13:31] take to bring forth the
[1:13:34] seed now as I say don't you
[1:13:37] believe don't you believe brother Randon
[1:13:39] planted the word here and un adulterated
[1:13:42] from all Creed right now if you don't
[1:13:44] believe it go in the spoken word read no
[1:13:46] seed and you'll find
[1:13:47] out wait a minute Brother D he didn't
[1:13:50] understand the shs then nobody didn't
[1:13:53] understand them and nobody wouldn't
[1:13:54] responsible for for so don't go garbage
[1:13:57] can with your brains to let it
[1:14:01] run he said on spoken word is original
[1:14:03] see the pure and unadulterated word had
[1:14:07] been shown which we know it was his
[1:14:10] message
[1:14:13] right and yet at that time the man
[1:14:15] believed that the white horse
[1:14:18] rider was the Holy
[1:14:22] Ghost amen that's right
[1:14:26] come
[1:14:28] on you don't
[1:14:31] think but see he was the world nobody
[1:14:34] was responsible for knowing that at that
[1:14:37] time
[1:14:40] amen just because Clarence Lin even
[1:14:43] before brother brandham said that that
[1:14:45] didn't bring it to brother brandham
[1:14:47] because God had to bring it to brother
[1:14:48] brandham it wasn't nobody else that
[1:14:51] brought it
[1:14:56] you see where we do with our own ways
[1:14:58] and
[1:14:59] thinking but even if the word is planted
[1:15:02] pure and
[1:15:05] unadulterated why does not God Quicken
[1:15:09] that in everybody's
[1:15:12] heart that heard that on the
[1:15:15] tape or was sitting there when he
[1:15:17] preached it or was there the whole
[1:15:20] Ministry of the prophet and then all at
[1:15:24] once in these life days is turning
[1:15:26] against him until they're saying he was
[1:15:29] wrong here and wrong
[1:15:30] there now you tell me the word was
[1:15:32] planted pure and unadulterated in a
[1:15:34] man's heart and he said brother brand
[1:15:35] was wrong then I I'm just going to tell
[1:15:37] you I don't believe
[1:15:38] that I mean if you do that's all right
[1:15:40] that's your business but I'm going to
[1:15:41] tell you I don't believe that that's
[1:15:43] just like taking John 3:16 say I don't
[1:15:45] believe that or take acts 238 Matthew
[1:15:48] 28:19 well I don't know which one of
[1:15:49] them's
[1:15:51] right both of them's right amen that's
[1:15:54] right that's where we was
[1:15:59] wrong but
[1:16:02] listen I'll have to continue this
[1:16:04] message this evening I know for sure but
[1:16:07] watch now see then if the natural seed
[1:16:11] is like the spiritual
[1:16:13] seed that it must be planted into the
[1:16:17] ground correctly and brother brandom
[1:16:20] emphasizes what that in the natural you
[1:16:23] get the ground ready
[1:16:27] right you don't walk out with your corn
[1:16:29] and there it is you walk out in the yard
[1:16:31] and say I'm going to have a garden right
[1:16:33] there where well I'm all them weeds I
[1:16:36] just throw the corn I throw the
[1:16:39] beans you might get
[1:16:42] some
[1:16:44] right but what did he call it I believe
[1:16:47] the word was pre-prepared ground I
[1:16:51] believe that the
[1:16:52] wording pre-prepared ground
[1:16:56] you see why it's so important to hear
[1:16:57] the word of
[1:17:02] God now you can argue all you want to
[1:17:04] but the Bible still says it how can they
[1:17:06] hear without a preacher how can he
[1:17:07] preach unless he be sent then you say I
[1:17:09] don't need no preacher to tell me what
[1:17:11] the word
[1:17:14] says then you tell me you got the new
[1:17:16] bird now you know where I'm going to
[1:17:17] back up right there that's between you
[1:17:19] and God that's right that's right but
[1:17:21] that ain't according to the Bible may I
[1:17:24] be what the Prophet
[1:17:27] said he said I'm not going to tell you
[1:17:29] you women preachers you're not called to
[1:17:31] preach right right what did he say he
[1:17:34] said but it's not according to the
[1:17:40] word see it's leaving it up to you and
[1:17:44] God but irregardless of the planning of
[1:17:46] the word irregardless of the doing it
[1:17:50] takes the
[1:17:52] moisture to Quicken the seed right mhm
[1:17:55] we planted on I think it was Good Friday
[1:17:57] I'm not certain right along in there we
[1:18:00] planted the garden we planted some
[1:18:03] squash and cucumbers and green beans
[1:18:07] and and we got one squash and no
[1:18:09] cucumbers and probably half a dozen
[1:18:11] green beans and it had plenty of
[1:18:14] moisture cuz that's what the problem
[1:18:19] was but then we hit it just right
[1:18:22] planted it boy got pretty garden growing
[1:18:24] now just all them just
[1:18:26] growing and what I done with the beans
[1:18:28] instead of digging them up cuz I know
[1:18:30] and realize sometimes that can come on
[1:18:31] up so I went over just a little bit and
[1:18:33] just dug a hole little row and I put it
[1:18:35] green beans in there well over here
[1:18:37] where I done that lice and dug a little
[1:18:38] rad and put it in there it's this
[1:18:40] beautiful row of green beans you ever
[1:18:41] seen over on the other side the half
[1:18:42] dozen stalk see I was goofing up in what
[1:18:46] I was
[1:18:48] doing and you said what are you talking
[1:18:51] about I'm talking about
[1:18:54] how can you do it now may I quote an
[1:18:58] emphasis or emphasize a point that
[1:19:00] happened a brother one time told me he
[1:19:04] denied it later but before he died he
[1:19:06] came back and said I was
[1:19:07] right
[1:19:10] but he said I took my wife down to a
[1:19:13] Pentecostal
[1:19:15] Church to get her free in the Lord where
[1:19:18] she could get the Holy Ghost
[1:19:25] I said now brother I I'm going to tell
[1:19:26] you one
[1:19:27] thing you tell me that a
[1:19:32] Pentecostal can get the Holy Ghost on
[1:19:34] you
[1:19:36] better than somebody in the word of
[1:19:40] God that knows what the new birth
[1:19:44] is boy did he get upset with me and
[1:19:48] later he called me everything in the
[1:19:49] book and denied that he ever said it I
[1:19:51] said that's all right that's between you
[1:19:52] and the Lord you can say all you want to
[1:19:56] you told
[1:19:58] me well before he died he come back and
[1:20:00] told me he said you're was
[1:20:04] right now do you understand what I mean
[1:20:07] what was he trying to get his wife to do
[1:20:10] uh sister Gail can I use you she went
[1:20:13] one time to a place for healing and got
[1:20:16] in the line for healing and some way
[1:20:18] somehow she wound up over in the other
[1:20:21] line and she was going through for the
[1:20:24] Holy Ghost line
[1:20:26] you know all right well that's fine
[1:20:29] that's all right no
[1:20:32] problem
[1:20:34] but it just don't fit when you analyze
[1:20:38] everything correctly it doesn't match
[1:20:41] up I will even tell you an incident in
[1:20:44] the Bible that
[1:20:46] happened there's an incident in is it in
[1:20:49] the book of Acts yeah I'm sure but they
[1:20:52] had tried to get the Holy Ghost to come
[1:20:53] on those people right you
[1:20:56] remember and the Holy Ghost wouldn't
[1:20:58] come on
[1:21:02] them now in the
[1:21:04] Bible they called for who was it James
[1:21:07] and John if I get those wrong you put
[1:21:09] the one in there supposed to be but they
[1:21:11] called for the other disciples to come
[1:21:13] down and they came down and you know it
[1:21:15] doesn't say they said a whole lot and
[1:21:17] done a whole lot but all at once the
[1:21:20] Holy Ghost came on them
[1:21:22] people well you know what they must have
[1:21:24] been something wrong
[1:21:26] somewhere and that was even the
[1:21:28] disciples in doing
[1:21:38] that would you see Church irregardless
[1:21:41] of the best that can be done by any
[1:21:44] Minister brother brandham the Lord Jesus
[1:21:48] anyone
[1:21:50] else all you can do is plant the seed
[1:21:57] amen right there is no way Jesus said my
[1:22:00] own life didn't reveal that
[1:22:05] right now here's the one you don't
[1:22:07] people don't want to hear and we'll get
[1:22:09] to it this evening but I've used it
[1:22:11] before to you brother brandham
[1:22:13] said you can't be saved without a
[1:22:22] revelation now you see why I asked the
[1:22:24] question I turned it to a later that
[1:22:25] I'll use this evening so we'll go ahead
[1:22:27] and use that this morning brother Joe
[1:22:29] who's there other one go ahead and use
[1:22:32] the
[1:22:33] title you know because we'll use the
[1:22:36] other title this evening so this title
[1:22:39] will be what do you call the new birth
[1:22:43] and then we'll get on the title this
[1:22:45] afternoon all
[1:22:48] right but now irregardless of what you
[1:22:51] do you've got to have the anointing ing
[1:22:54] of the spirit of God to Quicken the word
[1:22:58] right in the natural you've got to have
[1:23:01] that's why that seed laid in the tombs
[1:23:03] over there in Egypt for thousands of
[1:23:07] years it looked like there had been
[1:23:09] enough moisture to done but evidently
[1:23:11] it's so sealed up there wasn't nothing
[1:23:12] because that's the only way I can
[1:23:14] express it because it looked like there
[1:23:15] had been enough dness but there wasn't
[1:23:17] but they took that seed took it out put
[1:23:18] it in the ground where the dness was you
[1:23:19] know what it brought seed for wheat
[1:23:22] right
[1:23:27] and see irregardless of the best way you
[1:23:29] can do of sewing the
[1:23:31] seed it's going to take the Holy Spirit
[1:23:35] to Quicken that seed that's
[1:23:39] right it's going to take the natural
[1:23:41] moisture to Quicken the seed for it to
[1:23:43] come alive it's going to take the
[1:23:45] spiritual Holy Ghost word of I mean God
[1:23:48] to come upon the word to make it alive
[1:23:51] that's
[1:23:52] righten to the best we can can do to
[1:23:55] plant the
[1:23:57] word you see I can stand here and say it
[1:23:59] to you and without backing up a a word
[1:24:02] off of it I've tried for 40 something
[1:24:04] years to explain this to
[1:24:14] you maybe it's me that ain't got it
[1:24:16] planted just right but I've
[1:24:19] tried I've done the best I could do that
[1:24:22] way I've tried I've cried I've prayed
[1:24:24] and done a lot of things to try to get
[1:24:26] to the right place to say it and I know
[1:24:29] and realize it I
[1:24:31] don't but yet I keep saying it until one
[1:24:34] of these days it'll
[1:24:36] click because I've always since I heard
[1:24:38] the prophet and saw what he's talking
[1:24:39] about that's reason I told you when when
[1:24:42] I heard him I knew I didn't have the new
[1:24:44] birth I ain't all of these people that
[1:24:47] come into the message and said that I
[1:24:49] come in the message so I know I had the
[1:24:50] Holy Ghost I spoke in tongues back in
[1:24:52] Pentecost and I thought that was it but
[1:24:55] now I know for
[1:24:56] sure cuz I believe the
[1:25:02] message but I still don't agree with
[1:25:04] brother random here I think he's wrong
[1:25:05] over here I think he's
[1:25:08] wrong now don't tell me you got the new
[1:25:10] birth I'm sorry forget
[1:25:14] it I tried to explain something one time
[1:25:17] to a brother and he left here because he
[1:25:19] said you saying I'm not born again I
[1:25:21] never said he wasn't born again I said
[1:25:24] if if you act like
[1:25:27] that and do those
[1:25:30] things don't tell me you're born
[1:25:34] again right right right I mean you want
[1:25:37] to go down to The Honky Tonks today and
[1:25:39] you got the strip teas who gets up and
[1:25:42] does a strip teas act in front of all
[1:25:44] the men and then sits down and talks to
[1:25:46] them about the Lord Jesus and trying to
[1:25:48] get them saved now I'm sorry I'm too old
[1:25:53] that's right and I didn't believe that
[1:25:55] when I was
[1:26:00] 20 all right so you got to have the
[1:26:06] moisture to have the spiritual birth
[1:26:09] you've got to have the
[1:26:13] moisture no matter how great it was
[1:26:17] planted right cuz you got to agree the
[1:26:20] disciples for three and a half years the
[1:26:21] word was planted in them right right
[1:26:24] you got to agree they went through
[1:26:26] justification of believing on Jesus
[1:26:28] Christ and who he
[1:26:29] was you got to agree that they went
[1:26:31] through sanctification St John
[1:26:35] 17 sanctify them through thy truth Thy
[1:26:37] word is true they went through those
[1:26:40] things
[1:26:43] right but they never received the new
[1:26:45] birth until Christ finished the
[1:26:48] process so what did they
[1:26:51] need well all they needed was the
[1:26:53] promise of God okay we'll drop back over
[1:26:55] I believe it's in John where it said
[1:26:57] Jesus looked at him and said receive ye
[1:26:59] the Holy Ghost and breathed on
[1:27:03] them that was always confusing right
[1:27:08] until the prophet explained it that's
[1:27:11] right but all it took was a simple
[1:27:14] explanation he said they didn't get the
[1:27:16] Holy Ghost right then cuz Jesus Christ
[1:27:18] hadn't died he said but they got the
[1:27:21] promise right of the Holy Ghost ghost
[1:27:27] y even his death and their resurrection
[1:27:30] and them seeing him never Quicken none
[1:27:33] of that no that's
[1:27:38] right even in the book of Acts two I'm
[1:27:41] sure it's two times I know it is with
[1:27:43] the with the two going on the road to
[1:27:45] EMAs and I'm sure it is with the
[1:27:46] disciples it says and he opened their
[1:27:50] understanding of the scriptures
[1:27:54] right that's it
[1:27:57] right that looks like a pretty good
[1:28:02] birth but according to the Bible it
[1:28:05] didn't
[1:28:06] work and to show you that it didn't work
[1:28:10] over in Acts one after the resurrection
[1:28:12] they see me fixing into sin they said
[1:28:14] you're going to restore the kingdom to
[1:28:15] Israel at this
[1:28:17] time they still never had their eyes on
[1:28:20] the right or understanding but why did
[1:28:22] those disciples need of three and a half
[1:28:24] years of hearing the pure unadulterated
[1:28:28] word I think we've been around 40 years
[1:28:31] long enough don't you don't you think
[1:28:33] most of us has been around about 40
[1:28:35] years in the message I'm looking at a
[1:28:37] few that would raise their hand and say
[1:28:39] it's over 40 years
[1:28:42] amen well I think it's about time maybe
[1:28:44] the moisture ought to be hitting
[1:28:46] somewhere
[1:28:48] amen
[1:28:52] right so will ended up by saying
[1:28:56] what then when the word is planted in
[1:28:59] you the
[1:29:01] gospel
[1:29:03] then Faith cometh by
[1:29:07] hearing and hearing by the word that's
[1:29:11] right so if you get anything I want you
[1:29:14] to show me if anywhere I want you to
[1:29:16] show me anywhere in the
[1:29:17] Bible or give me a quote from Brother
[1:29:19] brandham of anywhere that the holy ghost
[1:29:22] ever come on anybody
[1:29:25] that didn't hear the word
[1:29:27] first
[1:29:29] right
[1:29:33] amen they heard the word first there's
[1:29:35] no need talking about
[1:29:37] moisture that would be the dumbest idea
[1:29:39] you could think of excuse me but that'd
[1:29:42] be like me saying boy I got a beautiful
[1:29:44] garden planted well where's you seat
[1:29:46] they're still sitting in the house God I
[1:29:47] didn't put them in the ground I just dug
[1:29:49] the holes and put the fertilizer and
[1:29:51] covered them back up
[1:29:54] boy that's smart ain't
[1:29:59] it what do you think about the new bir I
[1:30:02] shouted I CED I spoke in
[1:30:09] Tong what about the moisture
[1:30:15] right God don't you ever get no idea in
[1:30:17] your mind that brother Dale don't
[1:30:19] believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:30:24] I sat and watched the video from the
[1:30:26] evening service and I cried I said God
[1:30:29] don't let them people ever get that
[1:30:33] idea that I would think that the Holy
[1:30:35] Ghost didn't come in as a
[1:30:39] birth but because I try to explain the
[1:30:42] mechanical part or the doings of what it
[1:30:45] is then you'll say brother Dale don't
[1:30:47] believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:30:49] I just don't believe in your idea of the
[1:30:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't
[1:30:53] believe my old idea of the baptism of
[1:30:56] the Holy
[1:30:57] Ghost see for one time in life I can
[1:31:00] bring down and at least think about the
[1:31:02] things where the brother Brown said it's
[1:31:03] God and you together and there as
[1:31:06] persons now you can't explain that I
[1:31:09] would like for you to do
[1:31:12] it well there two
[1:31:18] people that's
[1:31:20] right we will get to it this afternoon
[1:31:24] we've left the
[1:31:26] scriptures and gone to our own
[1:31:33] ideas the Holy Spirit I
[1:31:38] thought was the
[1:31:44] seal that sealed you
[1:31:47] in and him
[1:31:51] out I believe that
[1:31:55] well does it have to go in there to push
[1:31:58] it out why don't you just let it do what
[1:32:00] the scripture says you're dead and your
[1:32:03] life is hid in
[1:32:04] Christ
[1:32:06] sealed by the Holy
[1:32:10] Ghost then you can really see what the
[1:32:13] birth is and you're not denying
[1:32:21] anything let's stand come on brothers
[1:32:25] think on these things what do you
[1:32:29] think well we've done heard this y
[1:32:31] you're going to hear it some more so
[1:32:32] that's all right if you don't stay out
[1:32:34] for a couple two or three weeks you do
[1:32:35] that be okay okay cuz that's what I'll
[1:32:37] be on for the next two or three months
[1:32:39] maybe and I don't mean that wrong and
[1:32:41] sarcastic I just mean we're going to
[1:32:42] hatch this thing out enough to where
[1:32:44] that we're going to see it or we're
[1:32:45] going to forget it
[1:32:52] one now that Prophet would say the
[1:32:58] soul the real you that's who you
[1:33:05] are you mean there somebody standing
[1:33:08] inside of this
[1:33:09] body you don't deal with those things
[1:33:13] until it's necessary to
[1:33:15] move cuz I'm a
[1:33:18] unit but if death comes there is a being
[1:33:22] in this body that will step out of this
[1:33:25] body and be in a body that looks like
[1:33:28] this
[1:33:30] body younger yeah
[1:33:33] okay but it'll be a
[1:33:37] body but yet we don't believe that to be
[1:33:40] that
[1:33:45] real we don't believe that we're real
[1:33:47] that we're a
[1:33:49] supernatural element yeah that's right
[1:33:53] dwelling in a natural
[1:33:56] situation even a
[1:33:59] sinner is a supernatural
[1:34:03] element dwelling within a natural body
[1:34:09] right that's more real than we are go
[1:34:11] ahead what we got number 47 47 inpire
[1:34:15] book number 47 inpire book anybody have
[1:34:17] a need the alar open I know not why God
[1:34:23] want
[1:34:24] Grace to
[1:34:29] me do you know what the New Birth really
[1:34:32] why
[1:34:34] unworthy Christ in love redeem me before
[1:34:40] his
[1:34:42] own I
[1:34:45] know I
[1:34:47] believe and am
[1:34:50] persuaded that he is able
[1:34:54] to keep that which I've
[1:34:59] committed unto him we send this PR agree
[1:35:04] with him that you'll work out what is is
[1:35:07] needful he's come to yield himself to it
[1:35:11] then you just do the work you let your
[1:35:13] love and manifestation be there and
[1:35:16] guide him in Jesus name or how
[1:35:20] beling in his word what about it anybody
[1:35:24] else within my
[1:35:28] heart but
[1:35:30] know I have
[1:35:33] beli and am
[1:35:36] persuaded that he is
[1:35:39] able to keep that which I've
[1:35:45] committed unto him against that
[1:35:51] day I know not how the spirit moves
[1:35:58] convincing men of
[1:36:02] sin Lord Jesus our brother needs an
[1:36:05] opening of his understanding that's the
[1:36:07] best way to say
[1:36:09] it that Lord you just come down and show
[1:36:12] him you show him and he'll take care of
[1:36:15] the rest of it he's coming yielding
[1:36:17] himself to that point that he wants to
[1:36:20] walk in what you say but we believe you
[1:36:23] Lord we thank you in Jesus
[1:36:27] [Music]
[1:36:36] name
[1:36:38] all how much longer could we quote from
[1:36:41] the
[1:36:42] [Music]
[1:36:44] prophet the word that he would talk
[1:36:47] about people that's got to have some
[1:36:49] certain feelings or they don't believe
[1:36:51] they're right
[1:36:56] what are you going to do if they take a
[1:36:57] gun stick of your head and say
[1:37:00] deny that Jesus
[1:37:03] Christ and you know what they done in
[1:37:05] the dark ages a lot of them denied
[1:37:08] [Music]
[1:37:10] it but you know what a lot of them
[1:37:12] stayed with
[1:37:13] [Music]
[1:37:15] it and said we ain't got nowh else to go
[1:37:20] I know not are we at least to that place
[1:37:25] [Music]
[1:37:28] say Lord I don't know how nowh else to
[1:37:31] go been this way a long time I just
[1:37:33] going to stay with
[1:37:34] [Music]
[1:37:38] it to believe that what you are trying
[1:37:41] to do is reveal
[1:37:42] [Music]
[1:37:48] yourself that he
[1:37:51] chur to keep
[1:37:54] I said it years ago and I still believe
[1:37:56] it every doctor that I've ever heard I
[1:38:00] don't try to figured out with quotes and
[1:38:02] scriptures because you can get all tied
[1:38:05] up I go back to my new
[1:38:08] birth and say
[1:38:11] Lord that don't
[1:38:13] fit to my new
[1:38:17] birth boy bless God you putting a whole
[1:38:19] lot I'm putting everything I got on
[1:38:23] right that my soul agrees with what this
[1:38:26] word
[1:38:27] says if you think it don't come show
[1:38:33] me I believe what this word
[1:38:38] says that's all that's been ever held me
[1:38:40] for all these years to do is to believe
[1:38:42] that
[1:38:43] word and say thank you
[1:38:46] Lord that everything now come just you
[1:38:49] you take care of it and he'll do it
[1:38:54] I don't have to question it I've seen it
[1:38:56] see that but that ain't nothing to you
[1:38:59] that's to
[1:39:02] me but what about preaching 40 something
[1:39:04] years about a new birth and it ain't
[1:39:07] stopped climbing
[1:39:11] yet it ain't stopped getting greater
[1:39:18] yet what's the difference in the new
[1:39:21] birth at the bottom of the pyramid
[1:39:25] and then New Birth at the
[1:39:27] top it's all going to be a birth of the
[1:39:31] word each one of those virtues is a
[1:39:33] birth of the
[1:39:35] word all of it a birth of the
[1:39:39] word we walk out of here we can say I
[1:39:41] got the new
[1:39:43] birth CU it's the birth of the
[1:39:46] word Lord
[1:39:49] Jesus we just commit everything into
[1:39:51] your hands Believe In You Lord and
[1:39:52] believe in that you've led us and guided
[1:39:55] us to where with what we try to bring
[1:39:57] and we try to hold true to
[1:39:59] that that way we don't have to deny
[1:40:01] anything the prophet has to say about
[1:40:03] these things we can follow it don't
[1:40:07] understand it no don't claim to
[1:40:11] Lord but I claim to believe it I believe
[1:40:14] you we love you and we thank you got us
[1:40:17] now as we go eat natural meals and then
[1:40:19] bring us back together this evening that
[1:40:21] we may walk in you in Jesus name
[1:40:23] amen you just missed
[1:40:36] him after all this life
[1:40:41] over and our
[1:40:44] burdens have been
[1:40:47] lifted and we stand upon the mountain
[1:40:52] tops of
[1:40:53] [Music]
[1:40:58] looking over in that
[1:41:02] City that the savior is
[1:41:07] preparing it gives me fa that I can make
[1:41:12] it after all
