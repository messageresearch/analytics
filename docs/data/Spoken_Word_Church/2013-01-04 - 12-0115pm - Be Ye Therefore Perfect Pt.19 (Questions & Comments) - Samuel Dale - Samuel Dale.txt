announcement here uh I want you to uh um the people that have given me names of the families remember the ones that we were doing that we're praying for every day Joe's put them in alphabetical order and uh he's going to put them downstairs next Sunday uh so if you have any to add uh there's 80 people on this list of just family members in this congregation that need salvation 80 people that I pray for every day I talked brother Joe and he was also I don't know if he was going to do it or not but he was talking about getting a picture face he's going to Facebook and getting all the pictures he can if anybody else knows of any of the pictures these people that we can put aside of them because a picture to a name means a lot but but here's 80 people and I know some of you hadn't even hadn't put your children on here yet and some of you had requested to be put on here yourself so uh let's get this thing done um it's a wonderful thing that you I said every morning before I start my day I said every morning I pray over these names right here lay my hands on them call most of them 90% of them a lot of times I don't call all of them cuz we don't have time but you know what it's something for us to be praying about yes all right if you don't want your children saved then I doubt you even Sav yourself that's right I got one amen that was about it thank you if you don't want your kids saved then I doubt you're saved yourself all right so if you don't have any names up here let's get them on here and let brother Joe get them out he's got them an alphabetic order and they will be put downstairs and there's not one of these that I don't that I don't pray for every day you just have to keep them on your heart and on your mind and for another thing I want to u to uh tell you about thing that we're going to do starting February the 23rd in at Keller Williams realy in Gainesville uh junor N I know somebody you know that we went through the financial piece university uh classes with Dave Ramy last year and U it's been you know I've been kind of dwelling on it myself and you say well we're we're bride and we're getting out of here I was telling the kids downstairs in the Sunday school class that you know brother brandom said if you knew God was coming tomorrow and you were going to plant potatoes what' he say stop no he said plan if you were going to get married he said get married he said if you're going to build a house he said if you knew God was coming tomorrow build a house all right so on February the 23rd at the Kelly Williams build building we'll have it downstairs for you to to look over we will be doing a u a class at uh at Kell Williams every Thursday night starting March the 1st for 13 weeks to um help us you say well I don't need any help I can do it myself well if you hadn't done it already you know the Lord the holy spirit's in all of us but he also give us pastors and deacons and masas and daddies if we knew how to do it we're sheep people we need to be led all right and this is not a get rich quck scheme this is taking the money that you make now and do and doing better with it it's a faith-based uh it was mentioned to do it here at church but I don't want to do it in the sanctuary CU there'll be a lot of talking and you do have to do videos and there's nothing wrong with uh with what he brings out um I just give you a little testimony June and I we started when February janary January of last year and we took the 13we course and in that 13we course we we paid off $6,500 in credit card debt and other debts that we had just in that 13 weeks and we didn't do anything special except Sterling was happy enough to pay me $1,500 for my four-wheeler so that kind of helps but it's taking the money and resources that you already have not trying to get it from somewhere else all right so if you're interested in joining February the 23rd at 7:00 we're going to have a preview it'll be a preview for about 30 minutes and then March the 1st we'll start classes at 7:00 to 9:00 at carer Williams rail game brother Joe will be putting it on the on the website for us to to look at if anybody else has any um anybody else that you think that you might want to attend um there's no charge for the preview and there's no charge for one U class the kit is $93 uh plus shipping and handling is $951 so we always say it's the best $100 you'll ever spend because out of that $100 Jun and not save $6,500 in 13 weeks and we did not do anything special we didn't go borrow money from anybody we we did it with what we had but um it'll help us all I think that that we all feel better if we have a little money uh I know we're not building the kingdom for down here but you know what it always feels good to know you know that God give us the ability to be good stewards not just of the land but be good stewards of his money because I told him downstairs you know God God does more with 10% and we can do a 90% he doesn't go look at the stop report every week he doesn't get up every morning and look at Wall Street he takes the 10% that he gets and he just he he just rules his whole Kingdom with that 10% but um you'll understand let me give you one little thing brother uh uh Dave Ramy said that he said only 3% of Evangelical Christians tithe 3% and I know that 90% of you do but only 3% look at these great big buildings they built God's blessing somebody just out of that 3% but you're robbing yourself of a blessing if you're not tithing and and the tithe don't go to brother Dale the tithe goes to God so you're not robbing brother Dale of the money you're robbing god of the money and God don't need your money but you know what we're sheep we have to be led we're told that we are to give 10% and in this class you will see how that you can take the money that you already are making and you can do more with it and have more uh I told him downstairs there's not a I'm not 100% behind Dave Ramsey's philosophy but at least 90% And if I'm 90% right most of the time that's not too bad so being 90% is better than than what we were doing it really made um June and I were really you know had had a good time at the class and we got to meet some new people there but U if you're interested like I said we'll post posters downstairs but February the 23rd at 7:00 we we will have a preview and of the class and then we will begin the classes on March the 1st so just think about it I know we all uh I told him downstairs it's interesting that uh even when I wasn't serving the lord I still thought I should watch my money cuz I knew God give it to me I me I wasn't a Christian but I knew and I know Ryan said he he came to me today and said he's got a testimony of taking the a part of the class on in uh on CDs and uh that it will really bless you and it will because you know spiritual or not we got to live every day we got to get up every morning we got to go to work there's a thing comes in every month called a bill lights gas whether you have a fin whether you have a a house bill or not you've got water bill and light bills and bills bells and that's right and you got uh kids that give you bells and amen hallelujah to that I know that but uh this will help I think it will but on March the 1st it will be open to everybody so but it will be a Christian based faith-based uh totally from the Bible scriptural class if anybody wants to attend so now you can call Sor let's stand and change the order of service she Open the Eyes of My Heart comes heart Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you I want to see you Open the Eyes my heart Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you I want to see how do you want to see you to see you high and lifted up shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love and we sing Holy Holy Holy I live shining in the light of your glory pour out to power and sing Holy Holy Holy Love holy holy holy holy holy Ho Holy Holy ho I amen and amen amen and amen enjoy the children amen that are working with them and helping them and get them to singing and doing and taking the services and everything we really appreciate that because you know that is really a a time and an hour that our kids need to be involved that's right do you know in the work of the Lord start training them up early and then they won't have no trouble later on right amen so remember that if you'd like turn in your scripture turn to Matthew 5 and first Peter we read this morning and then we'll get into the questions and comments and things and I hope you've enjoyed this series and we'll do that and like I said we'll be probably taking a few topics of things that are doctrines in the m message around the the thing the message of the hour and you know speaking upon those things to try to show why we don't believe this or why we don't believe that or why we do believe this or whatever and try to put it into the Bible and things so if you have one write it down and say you know would you speak on this so we'll put everything together and get it all you know related to uh the Bible and things and just have a good time I encourage enourage you to uh sign up with way and them about the things they he asked me about it I said sure go ahead and announce it because you know I encourage you to do that and your financial matters and things it's helped them so you know just uh go and see if it'll help you and uh if you know that would be be wonderful uh as a matter of fact if you want to I will pay for anybody that will take it is that a deal I'll pay for anybody that will go take it amen because that will be the helps and the doing so just remember that anybody that wants to go I'll be glad to play for it okay amen and just you know do it and try to help you all right Matthew 5 let's pray before we do and remember those that that we requested prayer for this morning remember uh you know brother David's wife and these others that are sick and different ones Brother Dean preaching this weekend so remember that remember brother Aaron will be preaching the Lord withing Wednesday that's right we'll be in Alabama but if nothing don't hinder us we will be live watching you right you know so we'll get Timbo to kind of turn it around on Wednesday you know and show us that where you're all here or not that should be a good way of doing it but we can maybe do okay let's pray father we thank you Lord for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for the day and we thank you Lord that you are present with us and guiding us thank you for being with the children bless them Lord and we thank you your love to each one we pray and Lord just have your way now as we talk about your word and we come down to the end of the series and we kind of have little questions and answers and comments and things we just ask you to be with us and bless us and guide us cuz you're the only one that can answer the question of on any heart because of the way we are as human beings and Mortals but yet you know how to deal with each one of us forgive our sins lead us by thy Grace and guide us in jesus' name amen Matthew 5 we'll go to 43 through 48 ye have heard that it hath been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you and do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven in other words that you may have the nature the character of your father which is in heaven all right for he maketh the son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have you do not even the publicans the same and if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the publicans so be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect now the last we read this morning verse 13 of First Peter wherefore gir up the loins of your mind be sober in hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word you give that yeah now we're giving out a copy of report that brother Joe we asked him to kind of run up a report to you know how we were doing on the internet system and things and uh you know looking at it and uh we really appreciate the fact that we can say that there is a lot of people listening you got one yes I and uh you know we really we really appreciate the Lord allowing us to do this because it's you see that's the your money you're putting in and all is paying for the things to be able to get the message out and it is getting out you will see when you get the paper that it's getting out pretty heavily at least there is a uh you know somebody's clicking on and doing something and to the internet system people out there that are watching live and those that will watch on other times we appreciate you we we thank God that you have count us worthy to listen to us a little bit and you know and we hope that we have been a help to you to uh be able to uh speak a few things that maybe you were interesting in at least uh if not if not more than what Paul said that even if you Pi by contention or arguments you know he said he gloried in it so if we are nothing more than uh that part maybe the Gospel of Jesus Christ be placed out and get to the right person we're looking for that final seed and the final seed may be sitting in the seats a lot of people are out there you know going and I believe in it and sending missionaries or people around the world to foreign countries to do those things have been on those places and done a little of it ourselves and thank God for the opportunity but getting down into the old age stage you you're not traveling very much and things but you know maybe we can can get it by internet and you know the systems and people can can hear and and be able to do this we appreciate these brothers that are doing it and you know getting everything done cuz I just simply go in and ask them to bring up something and they they get everything for me and you know they do it and I really appreciate it we kind of gave them a day off today on the quotes and things of putting up and you know just kind of this morning run through a a little thought about the end time because I believe that there is a Grace right and that Grace is the fact that God will not impute sin to someone right that's Grace you just think about it then we found out who that was right that it was a person that was dead to their themselves right and letting Jesus Christ come and live in their hearts and that there would be no sin there to be accounted for all right but see just looking at the uh the report brother Joe gave and uh you know as you got it there and he's putting it on the internet system where they can can do it um for the whole year here as far as the internet system uh we've had and when it's called unique visitors that kind of means like a one per one time click you know somebody coming on new or something and this past year we had 74,2 48 of those but look at the number of visits to our website now these may not be that they do to a whole service and it may be that they just look at pictures but still they do connect on it was 74,000 240 excuse excuse me 133,134 96,6 51 but for hits look at that there been over 5 million there's been 5,927 357 hits that means somebody did at least click somebody did turn on well then you can kind of tell whether they stay with you by how much is used and look what was used 7,459 almost 7,46 gigabytes now I can't even count what a gigabyte is I know you know coming down we we used to have the 286 in you know the the 386 and it went to the 486 and none of that was a gig that wasn't even it wasn't even started and that is a lot of information that has been captured out there all right then you look down at the live video since we've been doing it since May yep and you can see that mainly the the looking at it that there has been uh 6,000 uh 180 hits they've been visits to it of of 1,39 they've already used up 16147 gab just on live live right just on live so that means somebody is at least listening amen and if they're listening I pray that they would forgive us of all of our problems and troubles and you know if they're looking for a perfect Church to connect on the video you might as well cut it off you know cuz we're not that but we're trying to be perfect in Jesus Christ cuz he's our Perfection and we're just trying to get the message of the hour out on the basis because that was a desire of my heart years go was to be able to go and to speak and you have heard me say it and you know I mean it that like in 82 83 and all in there when I was preaching the SE and 74 with the Daniel 70 weeks and all and I'm willing today to do it put your name to it send it to the world and let you get all the glory out of it cuz Jesus Christ is going to get the glory in the end time going be finished but you know I I really appreciate it and I always wanted to and I thought well maybe Wade will be able to go and he's able to go a whole lot more than I was and I'm not against anybody that doesn't want me to come and preach cuz I'm just I know I'm blunt and people are afraid of me they afraid I might be blunt in their Church you know this is I'm blunt here that's really a scared of it I guess but that's all right you know no problems so but anyhow so I was praying and said Lord will some way get the message out to not what I preach but what the prophet of God has brought us right and the fivefold ministry has been used to be able to put it together to help us and you know to do and and he told me one day he said well you got your request because of the internet system that's going around the world you know so I appreciate that that's I really do amen and I'm not the final Authority in this message we will as I said probably next week begin a few services on doctrines because we have a lot of new ones here you know not heard maybe or maybe heard something out there and maybe a lot of times people have heard things out there they thought they agreed with right we were riding down the road talking to certain people one day and U I said something and the sister turned around to her husband and said is that what we believe he said nope that ain't what we believe we was wrong you know but that's all right that was you know and you know it's it's no problem being to be wrong is problem in staying wrong but truth we were talking last night in the Bible study about it you know that you could actually have made fun of somebody or done something like that and and and it not be that God count that as blaspheming right because of the honest of your heart right look at Paul causing people to blaspheme that's right but yet I don't believe he was he was sincere he thought he was right and you know what what he was up to where he was y right because the law was the law he was with it he would stand with it but then see he I don't believe he ever made light the wrong way right he just done things wrong and God forgave him from doing that and he was even killing the Christians and things so then it's all into God you know and we were talking about that last night all right but what we want to do this afternoon is just take a few uh questions and comments and just talk a little about the what we've been saying and then to lay it down to where that someone could out there listen and say well okay after after 18 sermons I finally know what he said cuz I'd rather do it that way you know and that was kind of the last two or three messages we've had because of company and different things that we we changed a little way of just you know bringing things out and I I like to do it that way I don't like to just be because there's no need of it just put out what you believe and put it out in a heart of love and Let It Go all right right and and and follow on in the Lord but I hope you've been following me what I've been saying about there's no one can be perfect right but yet the prophet of God said ever born again Christian I gave you that quote ever born again Christian right is perfectly totally sinless in the sight of God right now that's a wonderful position can we realize our Perfection doesn't come through ourselves it doesn't come upon what you know uh how much we know of the message that's right it comes upon how much of the message has been revealed personally to us right see there's where our Perfection lies is in Jesus Christ see in the eyes of man nobody can be perfect but in God eyes if we can see that we are in Jesus Christ Jesus Christ was perfect all right see then we don't have to kind of figure out that you you don't do this and you don't do that and you don't uh you know practice sin well we know that a true Christian is not supposed to practice sin that's that's the point we know that for certainty because you can't credit sin to God himself all right if God is in us living in the soul right amen now I've tried to make that you know blunt and plain living in our soul our soul then by the new birth is perfect all right not complete even the prophet would say he said because you only have the earnest of your new birth and things it's just an Earnest but the new birth you receive all right the pyramid shows us that cuz then we grow in Grace and knowledge up through and coming out to the right place to see you know Christ Living in US Amen in his name nature and and in doing that then we realize that we have problem out here in the body and spirit right a true born again Christian I've tried to tell you cannot Sin from their soul right all right it's not the soul that sins right it's the body and spirit amen all right it is the one that is caught in the problems of life and doing wrong and never things see then you might say well now how can you sin with your body and spirit without it being your soul right well as I said to you I surely hope that you're not going to say to me that you Sin from your soul if you're a born again Christian right now that would put us in a bad category and that surely would make salvation a lost thing right but I tried to explain that to you over and over that we're under the blood of Jesus Christ and if under the blood of bulls and goats sin would be covered there in the Old Testament how much more under the blood of Jesus Christ which would not only just be the blood it's over the whole world right amen the whole world is covered by the bumper blood of Jesus Christ that's right and sin is not being you know setting up there I get no no he don't have to wait around and do things like that he has a record that he can do and keep up with yes right and we must keep that record clean all right and I believe as a Christian and taught you that that the prophet said we sin a sin as a Christian we'll reap a tub for that's right am and he said Christians are the only ones who have sins plal a sinner is condemned on a higher level he's just a sinner it doesn't matter all right you don't have to stand up there and say did you do so and so yeah did you do so and so yeah did well well I guess it's enough against you to kill you no he won't have to do that no right it won't be on that basis but around said you'll just turn your head walk away that's right thank you J about that see but yet the Bible says that there are religious people that have come up and say have not I cast out devils and done Mighty Merit things in thy name and he said depart from me I never knew you he never had a personal experience of Salvation they never were born again but they were anointed ones Christian is what we would call anointed realm yep good people and the world is full of those people and God will deal with those people later right but we as the body of Jesus Christ already have eternal life in the soul and working upon this body and spirit to bring it under subjection right you know to the one we were kind of discussing some of this last night really had a wonderful time in enjoying it and talking about if somebody goes out and does something wrong and you commit them you know or you do whatever you got to do and and all the things you would have to do and how you would pray for a person up to a certain point and then you would stop praying for them you said well brother D there's no way I could ever stop praying for my children that might be what's wrong that's right exactly right amen now we explain that last night it most tell you wouldn't there we explained that the best we could if a child or somebody if I committed wait over to the to the Lord because he was doing wrong it wouldn't straighten up right then I'm not going to pray for him anymore n I'm commanded not to brother R said I don't want to pray for somebody that I don't know he said because if I pray and cast that off he said I will get in trouble with the Lord amen now that's his words he said I want to know if it's there for a reason see if know like I said if I committed way we did we go through the channels you pray for him up to the point that we say you got 30 days after 30 days you don't straighten up you quit praying for it yeah but that's just that's mean mean to what I'm want to save him right that's it if I keep glorying in him that's what Paul said about the man in the Corinthians right he said you're sit here glory in other words you're you're not arguing with you're not condemning the man because he's living with his father's wife yeah you know he said you're not doing that he said well when you get together and do something about it that's right well you know what they got together and done something about it brother Brown said second Corinthians a man wound up being a good deacon now that's his words but where would he have been if it kept home and hadn't got together and committed to the Lord that's right now we know that we don't commit people to the devil no that's what we used to think that's what people think you know we're just turn him over to the devil you can't do that no you brother around explained that right yep he said you commit them to God yep he he will commit him to the devil right but like I said what if we here at the church and we're praying for Wade you know and he's out doing wrong and and we're here and we're praying Lord we just turn him loose to the devil send the devil after him and he's over there praying and saying God forgive me and you're in trouble y but if we commit we're here and we commit him to God God's on the other end don't worry about it just right now right but that's just thing we discussed it might interest some of you to come and we just have common questions and answers what I call it is whatever comes off the floor right but see I hope you understand what I'm trying to get at under the blood of Jesus Christ This World out here God is Not Looking Down with envious hateful eyes he knows that's right and he's waiting yes but you know what when the bride goes up in the Rapture yes sir the blood leaves right there is no blood Covenant when the bride leaves in the Rapture that's right so then your people are not going to be that you think that you're praying so much for them now and don't want to commit them to the Lord there's not going to be any blood then no that's right what kind of a situation you want them in that's right the Bible says that the animals leap right off of your body while you're standing here right said you'll cry for the rocks to fall on you and hide you you can't even die amen now that' be horrible wouldn't it yes see we're trying to save people not it sound like see when you first hear about us and then you you you wonder what what kind of people we are and then somebody comes along and says oh them people down just believe just believe in committing people to the to the devil see you tell them no that's wrong we believe in committing them to God right amen you know and then we could let let God take care of that's right right but see then getting back to the story where we get on see then that bumper blood is covering but one day that bumper of blood will be gone right now God is keeping records yes that's right because there are records we explain that that as I said the prophet said you sin a sin as a Christian you're going to rip a t full from it am yeah but youve told us that we couldn't sin you can't Sin from the soul right right that soul that is born again now not just because you're anointed not because you go to church not because you believe the message if you are truly Born Again amen that Soul can never sin again right you sin with your body spirit and soul if you're lost right because you're a product of sin when you're born again your soul can't sin all right got a question cut on the line of that but get to point that you can't sin is it that Soul can't sin why cuz John said his seed remained you the seed of God can't sin amen because the seed of God is a revealed word that's right so he can't account sin to God that's right so God living in us that's how we're perfect that's right right I mean we we went over that over that over and you said well I've heard it so many times well did you finally get it right at least you know what I believe right all right but now let's just get down cuz I'm cover most time I speak for quite a while and then I have comments and all but I've got one here that that I hope that the person that turned it in don't mind us just reading the comments you know the whole thing we'll get to that in a minute but we got a couple of comment questions that I want to cover first all right because then we'll take comments and things and then when we finish we'll try to to read some things all right this is kind of like a question that I know that Paul said I Die daily and brother rown said you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live okay now those are correct right right amen the prophet said it the Bible says it now I like this part but do we ever reach a point before our body change where we can say that we truly are dead to ourselves and not have to Die daily all right now I stay with the prophet of what he said and now listen to the point I believe we're going to be a sticker because we're going to be human right until the change of the body all right we're going to have problems as human life yes that's a normal thing and it it will be with us all of our life yes I never taught you that that you'll come to a place that you just won't never do wrong right I don't believe brother Ram ever taught that I don't believe the Bible teaches right no or Paul would said I Die daily right all right but I do believe that the longer we are in Christ it might not be that we overcome to the point to not have problems because that would have to that would take a whole sermon in itself to define the thing right it's not wrong to be tempted Jesus was tempted that's right the Bible said in all points as we are yet without sin amen all right so what was the what's the difference in him you know what was it he didn't entertain that right it wasn't that it didn't come through right I mean he was out there 40 days and you can't live like that there's no such thing in the Bible as a 40-day fast all right people say oh this that no brother R tells you to no such thing he said he never fasted over 3 days in his life I know that's most people B the message will just about beat you to death about that well that's what he said all right now you believe him but now he might not ate nothing but one meal a day for months or years that he was fasting yeah but as far as a fast he said never over 3 days all right now if if it's true then I believe the closer we get to God through the revealed word the more truth we know amen all right like I said there the other night about it you don't have dreams you don't have wrong thoughts m right we do what do you think well what about a dream I bring that out because of our our connections and our Realms and things and you say well is that my soul well if it's born again it can't be wrong now if it's not then it's just everything else right well see then we got to learn the difference between what is sin right right all right and what is unbelief right well now I got to quote where brother R said all sin is unbelief amen I agree with you I've been through that I believe that right but I got the quotes where the Prophet said I sin every day so now you going to argue quotes yeah or you going to just sit down long enough to listen yes right no you won't do it you going do what you want to do anyway cuz you're not going to change you know it takes God to change people's ideas said right here hear it said every day and still not believe it right that's right y cuz you know what you know I'm up here talking you out there trying to figure out what we're going to have for supper where we going when to get through I didn't like what he say and you know what it just totally annihilates everything it said right and really you don't hear right right right right so then we ought to listen amen that's why I encourage you right why we have the tastes right you don't understand something I say like I've always said get the tape that person come to me one time said Brother D you said so to I no I didn't yes you did I heard you solve the problem we'll get the T we'll play the T if if I said it I'll be glad to apologize right but I know I didn't say it right so let's go get to take solve the problem they didn't want to get to take face it because they knew if I was were willing to put it on the line and I figured I must not have done it right all right but listen Church sin sure it's to disbelieve God's word right all right right and you say well really what we do is we disbelieve God's word it it's not that we disbelieve God's word it's not to happen right it it's not to say we disbelieve did Jesus disbelieve when he was tempted no did brother brandham disbelieve when he was tempted so it's not dis believing to be tempted have thoughts and to do wrong right it's sin when we try to justify that right amen you agree right when we try to justify we try to say that I really didn't do it or this that or the other about then we make it into sin like I told you about the children of Israel 10 times from crossing the you know coming out of Egypt right to Cades Baria they sinned 10 times and God was still taking them to the promised land but when they refused to believe what Joshua and Caleb said about the promised land amen they went to the Wilderness and never went to the promised land amen it became unbelief the other was Natural Things life sin we're hungry we're thirsty he brought us out here to kill us you know yeah but when they got to the point that they said we don't believe we can go into the promised land that was unbelief amen I tried to explain to you you know where the Bible said that lust when is conceived brings forth Sin Sin when it's finished brings death amen that's right see lust right it's not wrong to have a wrong thought right a wrong desire but if we entertain that yeah until it becomes a part of us that's it right see where it would be with me one thing might be brother Mark another way brother Donnie another way it's never the same with all of us and something that that I would tell you that bothers me you would life like everything but you know what you tell me that bothered you i' life right right because we're all different that's true and we're dealt with different amen but then that establish tried to through the series of sin and what it was if it finally comes down that we disbelieve this message we disbel something brother around say it or we know it's right and won't do it now that's iniquity right and that's that's iniquity iniquity is to know to do good and won't do it am that is sin that is disbelieving God's word right to see something and refuse to do it because of some reason it would cost me too much it would mean this it would mean that yeah if I if I took my stand upon that word well you can get out into unbelief right there right so I hope you can understand that part of it to where that I can make this statement about it about the questioning enough will it ever come to worth we we won't be yield into the body I believe through the opening of the word we find out I hope through the series that I've been in that at least some of you have found out y right that what you thought was sinning right y you know wrong and we're not talking about going out and do it wrong we're talking about just life and condemnation of life you know cuz see lot of people preaching against man and wife being husband and wife yep you know what I mean by they preach against it that's sin that's part of the garden that's not sin I just wonder what they think amen if you say okay let's erase it back to where your Mother and Daddy brought you yeah you get what I'm saying let's take it back to Where Your Mother and Daddy lustfully brought you see people don't want to talk like that to me right but you see yeah I believe the closer we get in the word it'll be revealed to us the more of life that is normal thing right amen amen that's right normal things that's right I've heard people preach if you wore two tones you shoes is going to hell heard people preach that it was a sin to K send your kids to school and to get an education cuz education was of the devil yeah and they took their kids out of school all right sure did see that's why people don't like me cuz I can't help it my memory works and that's just like doctrines I want you to understand some things and just think about them you know that brother randam told Billy Paul when that boom was going to go off and he didn't know what it was he had the dream and all he said ain't no human could stand it he said get Joseph and put him in make sure he gets an education yeah and you know that none of their kids they quit school would you mind explaining some of those things right amen all right M you know that Billy Paul after brother Brandon was out on the field been on it a long time Billy and as much as he said about going to college y Billy Paul went to a Christian Bible College that's right GRE that's where he met brother PR green was and you know that they told a story that that they was fixing to say something about brother Bill Paul PR did and the phone rain they was fixing to say something in some way the phone rain and brother randam was on the other end want to speak to the professor orever who it was in just a few minutes everything got changed see you can't you say but but it's wrong that see like I said I've heard it that's right I've heard it preached that the women I mean read quoted stated that women will be saved and childbearing well what if a woman can't have a child yeah that's what I asked one brother right they would preaching it yep I said what if you can't have a child see what I'm saying is I'm trying to answer the question and the point of what I'm getting down the more we come to God the closer we come we're still going to be stickers right the prophet said it until we changed amen but I believe that the stickers is going to get less right right now don't don't tell me you running around with men or women and then you no we ain't talking about that class forget it we're not we're not garbage in if you got that problem then you're lost right period blunt right man I'm going to go ahead and say something I said last night I've been able to for a long time anyway you know a lot of people knows a whole lot more about what goes on in this church than I do that's right you know why cuz I don't get out and meddle in everybody's business right that's right I only hear what you tell me right I don't mail you know I'm not on the phone do you hear right you he right yeah no amen I don't do it I always told you stay on the phone over 5 minutes you're gossiping amen okay people don't like K I don't care how long it take you to tell you hey what I doing we we leaving in the morning okay 4 hours later we still leave it in the morning now Ain got something no you can't do that okay but get it right here's my point if you know something in this church and this is to everybody that goes to this church whether you're here today you're at later or what if you know something's going on in this church is wrong and you don't come to me or one of the deacons and let them come to me right then the sin is on you right I've been able to say that a long time because I know I know a lot of people around here that are gossiping brother they just don't know what's going on I don't know what's going on cuz ain't gossiping right you claiming you spiritual cuz you know yeah no you running your mouth right BL that's right amen the sin is on you that will become sin if you don't come and tell me right Amen to where I can deal with it right okay right now is that clear enough you know something going on in the church it's the wrong the sin is on you not the person that's doing it the person that's doing it is a problem right right but you're a bigger problem because you're see concealing the thing right come to me and tell me about it and we'll deal with it no matter me if it's my kids right grandkids my wife or myself that's right we'll try to get it straight cuz that's what I believe in amen you find out you get a lot less yak and Yak I'm being straight okay right see that can become the wrong thing all right get down to it do you believe brother Dale it will ever be worth I believe that the more we learn about the word of God right right the less his flesh will control us right that's right there was a time I know a lot of you were Christians they were smoking right they used to be in church you know going somewhere I talk about the messaging or something talk about you're smoking well you know that was a bad problem for you but you know I never had a problem with it and what I mean I didn't problem with that you doing it here well you're sure a strange preacher no I believe in Salvation I don't believe in disgrace I believe in Deliverance Sister Hazel F bush used to play the piano she played the piano when she was smoking and I have no problem with it well I just beat her to death she ain't been on my pull pit bless God you know okay but you know one day it just gone right you quit how many of you have at that way but you was out there and you were smoking cigarettes and you know what before you come around the message you maybe didn't know that was wrong right cuz everybody in the church where you was at was doing it well the opening of the word see the the coming into contact with the word right brought an opening that you could deal with your life right yep little things that we think in our lives the the opening of the word can bring that to a situation to where it can be dealt with right amen that's right right right to where we can get rid of it that's right that way it's not brother Dale preaching on the ever service show me where that's ever saved anybody now I'm I'm open that's right said we bless God ain't nobody in our church that's smoking we you might all check around sniff a little bit you might find out there's some wrong but you see you getting the point what I'm saying yes the closer we get to God I believe we will learn that we as human beings are Mortals that's right right and we'll do wrong amen and we'll be tempted amen right but we'll find find out how to control that right amen you know find out how to deal with it amen right right right we won't we won't put it to the basis that that we're willingly ignorant right you know we'll put it to the basis and we'll try to deal with it right that's the way brother Dale I believe in Deliverance amen yes sir if you quit smoking because brother Dale says it's right wrong to smoke you got a problem with a demon that's going to really torment you to death right right that's right like brother R said to that who was the name Bill or something like that and he he was out there and he was hunting and he said he went out you know he went off tied the horses up and he smoke and he come back and and when he come back around brother R called his name you know like Bill he said yeah he said when did you quit smoking he said just now he said just now now well was that which was the worst to beat him to death you had never heard him talking about hunting with a lizard eyed looking guy Bert Y and you know all of brother brandom's gifts never converted Bert no now you know while they was out there together that God dealt with brother brandom and you know he talked about the Lord sure right but you know that mother deer that had that nature brought birth to his knees not different amen you understand what I'm saying I believe the more we get into the word right the more the word is going to take away the things sure we'll still be stickers you'll never punch me that I won't say ouch but it might be that I learn a lot by it you know to get worded I don't ouch as much he used to work with a guy and he you know that people would punch him and he hit the guy next to you and one day somebody punched him he hit me and I waited while where's that and I said now Mitchell I want you to know that I'm not as dumb as you think I am you hting these people not all that bad jerking you do I can't help it I said yes you can now you can help it now M cuz you're not that bad you're not that kind of person well it wouldn't long somebody come up behind him and punched him he drove back like that he he's fixing to hit me when he did he went I said see there you can help so this no food around me see we're human that's right but learning about a human that's what caught me with brother brand brother BR was so honest and so straight he wanted to smoke he wanted to drink right but God kept him from it and he wasn't a Christian right he was protecting the gift right amen of the man right yet he would tell it yeah and then I read the Bible about Abraham and I knew how the Jews were run around one day come along look at said do you think them stun Jews would write that about Abraham right no they W know that in their record he said but God made him right right he see we will be stickers right until it comes to the basis that we can just keep walking away from our stick right until it gets where it won't hurt right but we'll be human until the change come amen that's right and when that change comes the brother R said something about you know your jobs won't be important then but did he say you'll quit your jobs they didn't say that right he said if you knew what you had in your pocket you would take it out in the street and burn it he never did burn the money he had in his pocket right right but he told us what it was right it's the dirtiest things see Don them gloves on Ain that something gloves on count money just give to me I'll take care of it all the dirty stuff me I'll give it to the teller she can put blood on but see we'll be human until the change right amen that's right maybe in that 30 40 days when we see the dead among us we might be a whole lot more sensitive about our lives and things right because we're supposed to be here that long you know right right but until then it will be stickers the new birth never took away from Brother ROM the love to hunt right right right you may love to be model cars the new birth is not going to take that away from you right no aild in model cars right we were all life in cuz ter and them still got the old uh what was that record player thing the big old thing that we bought when we first got men the wife when way come along about 1960 we bought this thing and to get to buy it we was allowed to get $25 worth of toys Well w was one or two years about a little over a year old and so of course Wade wanted a a train a car set you know that's what he wanted because I was the one that told him what he wanted so I went in and got the car and I took it home and I put it together and I said get him out of here he's turn up the car that's right just human anything wrong with being human no a lot of said about brother random in his ways but that's one thing it caught me was a man that would tell y that when he asked his wife kind of like tell them that I'm not here you know he wouldn't he went out the back door the income tax case and God condemned him and you know he went down to pray for a baby and God wouldn't hear it that's right he went back and straightened up he went back and straightened up he went back said give me the baby now right see right around was a human yes brother called me the other day apologized to me for something he preached here I said brother I think more of you than I ever have I said because you'd be honest enough to say you was wrong right that's right see because that should be the Life of Christ in all of us amen that's right not beating and hammering on people I'm just getting down to that I ain't no com but that was the point say we truly can we become dead to ourselves brother right said you can live so close to God Satan don't know what to do with you now somebody's going to have to do that right but you know what if you find out that the things you are doing as a human being is not sin Satan is losing his hold that's right see people preaches sin to eat too much well is a sin not to eat enough right right I mean if I way you go count I like brother Mo's idea of it was you can only fill up a 55 gon drum or a 50 or a 3/4 in water pipe it's going to run out that's what it's doing it's running out on all of us maybe that's part of the stickiness we need to get rid of but you understand what I'm saying right the best answer I can say is right you know one day the closer we find more than way we find out that things are not wrong of our natural life right that's right then we can become free in God said You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free that's right but you say Well it don't bother me all of the things I do now I didn't say that do amen I said the things of natural life right you know the things we condemned ourselves with or maybe condemn others you know and uh I remember there was a lady used to come to church here and they had these kids you know and they they uh they kind of text you by colors you know the little kids anonym could tell you all about it you know and then school you can tell a lot about how kids do and they coloring and their doings and you know the picking of colors and if you pick black all the time then they got it you know their their thought is that you got a problem right you know you got troubles because you always picking black see then they start running all this psychological things you know and they find out a lot of times it's true you know something wrong but this lady was telling about this one kid you know and it said how come you they took it in to talk to us so we just want to know that how come it is that you always picking black you know the little kid said well that's the only color left that got to me one that's L of that okay let's get all right here are some comments another one and then we'll we open up kind of we know in Ezekiel 18:20 it says the soul that sinth it shall die and that's true right the soul that sinth shall die all right now that doesn't matter whether you are who you are or what you are the soul that sinth shall die right right all right now but then the point that goes on to say so sin is with the soul okay the spirit and the flesh displace sin's attributes said am I correct since we say sin is the unbelief of the Soul all right now I tried to explain it to the series of one point if you're born again you are a sinner by soul body and spirit until the day you become born again right amen all right the day you're born again your soul is not sinning anymore it's Eternal so you can't say God is sinning he said what your soul is your being yeah that's that's true that's why I love the prophet's message that when you're born again your soul is your theopen the Eternal God so you can't credit sin to him so then before you're born again Body Spirit and soul is sin right so the soul that sinth it shall die all right now soul that does not get corrected or goes on you know doesn't get born again one day will be annihilated true it will die right cuz only God can kill a soul there's nothing no way to to for Satan he can't do it and all right so then if I'm born again my soul becomes Eternal amen my body and my spirit is still in the the sinful condition of life so I'm not sinning from my soul right I'm out in my life living in my spirit and my body and my body it was used to doing things and my spirit was used to doing things right and just because you're born again see it don't take out all of that as we think amen that's right you said the day I got born again people told me you know the day I got born again I I didn't smoke no more we come find out about 6 months later when they got to that point you know but see the soul that sinth it shall die right and I taught you that what to be able to be born again your soul must die right let's put it more into the prophet's words the nature of your soul go not as your soul dies like dead you know like BL you're dead you're going to the Undertaker no no it's the nature or ways of that Soul amen is dead so the soul that sin us shall die right then you sin a sin is a Christian you're having to be sin with your body and your spirit amen that's right you can't be with your soul if you're born again God has done died right amen so the scriptures right the soul that sinth shall die amen so every soul has to die I see if I get that right how is it uh if you're lost you you die twice right if you're lost I hope I'm getting this in the right way you you di the natural death right all right then you would die the spiritual as you would call it or whatever at the judgment and be cut off and die that's that's a person that is not born again but you know a Christian only dies once that's right right and that's dying out to yourself right Amen to where you be born again he said yeah but they going to die go no Christians don't die right Sinners die you say yeah but we put him in the grave but he ain't dead he's still alive amen he ain't dead so if you're a sinner you die twice you're Christian you have to die one time amen that's right die to yourself so the Bible still right the soul that sinth it shall die and if it is my soul today that is sinning I'm dead I'm lost right when if my soul is sealed by the Eternal Word and born again right then the mistakes of life is in my body and my spirit amen and that's what we were talking about to start with we got to deal with that right we got bring that under subjection to the one that's within us and let him H away right and say Lord what Would You Do you ever done that upon a situation somebody upset with you or somebody something happening you having a problem uh anything you know working on a car building on something Have you ever stopped long enough to just say Lord if you was doing this what would you do right you know you'll find out all them pieces just go together you know like looking at a puzzle and to me Richard down there the other day he's got one on the table I guess he's got to finish I don't know but he had one out there and he he was doing them things and I I tried to put pieces together I said I'll take care of that I just got my pocket knife you know I don't fit them pieces that's not exactly the story where it's supposed to be but you know that's life right so everybody understand what I'm saying right if you're lost you sin when your body spirit and soul right amen if you're a Christian born again sealed by the Holy Spirit not just confessing Christianity because the nature of your soul is not dead and justification and it's really not totally dead at sanctification it takes a baptism of the Holy Ghost to burn out that old nature ways to kill it and that's how it dies amen so then my body as a body spirit and soul as a sinner you know before is converted all sin y from my soul but when I'm born again my body and my spirit is in a realm out here of life right that exist Y and there's not sin accounted to the soul blessed is the man to whom God will not impute sin why because he can't impute it no because you're born again amen then we took a couple of messages discussing the body and the spirit and even we're covered by the blood so God is not imputing but a record is kept as a Christian that we're going to give an the account of the Deeds Done in the body right and let me ask you a question seriously is it that God has to write these things down we said no it's his memory can do but is it really that or is it me and you right right I'm serious I'm H just asking you a question sister Gil is it that God is not liking what we do or is it that we don't like what we do right right but the god that's within us is saying that ain't right right it's not the god of Heaven having to come down and tell us it's the god in our lives he says that's not right right I didn't want to think that that's my brother that's my sister right amen and in that way I'm not looking down on everybody then and say oh they're not a Christian what does it matter they're human being right right human being my goodness well a little bit late getting started so okay I say my Lord is 24 but who's got any comments questions off the floor I gave you this from their sister that that you can take home read if we have time we'll do it but anybody got any comments questions from the floor and you got the microphone who will be first something about what I've been preaching wait got it over here need turn yours off turn it off and raise this up okay okay anybody anybody got any comments ments about it any questions about what I said these were the two that I received written in so that was that was the question I got Ry okay anybody you mean I preached it that well that you think you know at least you understand what I'm talking about I hope what about it questions comments or anything cuz you know how I am I don't care you tell me right on the floor I don't agree with you just give me a change okay um I never used to understand how sin is unbelief and sin is not drinking smoking and all that um that Ezekiel 18 saying the soul that sinth it shall die it doesn't say the body and spirit that sinth no correct so sin is uh linked with the soul and that's why sin is unbelief I could now clearly see that cuz the soul will either believe or not believe so sinning is not drinking smoking it's really unbelievable if if we could establish one thing that sin is not drinking gambling smoking running around etc etc that's not sin let's get that established all right then the life we live is not sin right you're in a different category of the life that we're living of human beings and and doings you know right cuz the prophet didn't say that uh you know he didn't say that to have a wrong thought was sin amen because that's that's not it it's Satan tempt him see he had the ability to even tempt the Lord Jesus now the only way I can explain that is you say that's impossible well let the Bible said it happened but the only way I can express that is that God had to some way allow that to move into a place that it could actually be Temptation that's right because you say well he was Body Spirit and soul God and his body and his his spirit and his soul was eternal but his body wasn't when a body without the spirit is dead so that's nothing so then some way Satan was able to enter a real and temp the Lord Jesus well how much can he do to you and I amen and the main thing he's doing today is trying to condemn us that's right amen about our thinking about our living that's right right that's right about our doings a natural life that's right when those are natural life that's right cuz he can't get you on one thing he get you on another one right I mean it's always been that way that's right but brother said if he can't get you to drink or anything like that he said he'll just get you to smoking and he said he'll hold you with that then what is life like you're saying it does say that exactly the soul that's sin it doesn't say the body and spirit that sin exactly right doesn't say that but if you're born if you're not born again it's easy to understand your soul is the unbelieving part and your body and spirit is displaying that's right right but then when you become a Christian your soul is eternal and cannot do wrong that's right that's right so the desires the things are not dealing with the inner part of you that's right cuz see if you go back to what the prophet said the inner part of you the soul he said it's either Faith or doubt that's right now there's no gray areas it's either Faith or doubt it's either born again or not born again right that's why I even covered the point that even at justification sanctification that that soul is still in a sinful condition right but when the baptism of the Holy Ghost comes it burns out all of that that's within there so then you don't how you you have no more conscience of sin that's right now you're getting into the bases that you don't practice because you're not conscious of it right so then the word practice can be used if it's used in the correct order but not used to just say well I can do a little bit but I just don't practice it a whole lot I've been through all the years those words have been used yeah you know some of you have but just not using it to prop up anything using it to be straight amen the soul that sinth shall die amen so if that Soul dies and gets a new birth or the nature of it so when you say die people think that you're saying that you actually died no When Jesus turned around there and he said Peter he looked at him and he said Satan you get behind me now was he calling Peter Satan right now he wasn't calling Peter that was he what was being said by Peter right what was being said by Peter brought that on that the Lord Jesus said get behind me he was talking to the devil that's right that's right right so then if the devil's not in there there's no sin that's right if you're born again right amen now we're dealing with this part out here body and spirit and see that's the end times the the Revelation to be revealed at the you know the grace the grace that was trying to say this morning that is brought at the Revelation in other words is God unfail unveiling his word to you and I that's right I I get Plum tickled at people people preach that extend to feed like to quote the prophet but you know what it's developed though it's developed that you're driving down the road now let's see how many agrees with it you're driving down the road you're running 55 mph you understand you're going 55 M hour and a bird flies up in front of you what's the first thing to do 90% of the time you don't put the brakes on you look at the speedometer to see if you're speeding and check it and see if I ain't right well because you think if I'm running 55 and the bird is his problem if I'm running 56 I'm sinning you it is wrong to speed that's right but has it become that it's wrong to speed or or is it that we thinking about the bird slap on the brakes to try to keep the bird getting killed or the dog or the cat or something and you run over the dog and you say well I I wasn't speeding that's the first thing we say right we go down the road and run over a dog first thing you say I wouldn't speak when you say the first first thing I didn't get them a break since time you know right but that's life life anything else there somebody else somebody back there okay sister try um referring to Matthew 5:46 to 47 um could you shed a little bit light because here when I'm reading when you sayate the publicans um it refers to uh public officials of the Jewish nationality but how are we to put that in our own language or you got it in a you got in a different translation or a different wording from your country no no no just for here it says you know um public officials of the Jewish nationality that's what we call the publicans just the general public we talking about here or like non-Christian people yeah now see the the publicans was a group of people like you say all all right then you you say Publican that that just signifies a group of people it doesn't necessarily mean a public official it can be that if it's a public official that does those things and to me Jesus was emphasizing that the Ley doesn't have much trouble a lot of time but the religious people are the ones that will cond demn you for being something wrong you know the religious preachers and the things called publicans in that way he would just putting it to be you know and he would say publicans and then other times he'd say publicans and sinners you know he would put them together but a lot of times he just say Publican meaning a group of people like the Pharisees and the big rulers you know because that would be he he'd say you you Pharisees you Hypocrites he's not necessar talking about all of the groups it's just the the nature of the people theu publicans would just be a like you're saying a group of people yeah but it's more or less the religious people is one he was after you don't see the Lord Jesus condemning the Sinners he was forgiven them but the religious people he would always against there's your publicans the your your group of people that think that they're right and he was saying that even if you do this you didn't don't even the publicans do this cuz they did they they give and they done and they worked and they kept the law to the letter and you know and better than maybe that we call it ly people that were common ones would do so he was always just picking on the religious and signifying to people is that what you're talking about okay anybody else brother Donnie my wife wanted to asked you this question and I just want to say before I ask that I've enjoyed this series you've done more than any this has been the best for me because filled in so many blank spots and it's brought a lot of things a lot brighter okay and I thank you for it I thank God for letting me be here and hear it and you here to bring it uh what I wanted to ask you was keeping the Commandments Works yes and no because it's yes in the bases that the Commandments are there right to be kept don't do this and don't do that but see then when you get in to say as it works no it was the right thing to do in that day that's right to keep it it's a right thing to do to keep the Commandments today right that that's where people think since we come into the New Testament we don't have no Commandments and we got the whole Bible and then to find out the 10 commandments brother round said was the same as the seals now that's something man right that he can say the Ten Commandments is the same as the seals but see then it's not works unless we try to make it something works is what we do because of what he done for us and in those days theirs were based on Works they done it or didn't do it that's right right because that's what they thought made them righteous Paul thought that and he said I the thing that I found to be you know I thought was right he said I found to be death see it become works with him instead of the revelation of Jesus Christ you say how can the seals be the Commandments and the The Ten Commandments was a revelation of Jesus Christ right amen oh and I first saw that I thought no what a prophet could understand that those Ten Commandments you read them Thou shalt not Thou shalt not but see you reading it wrong my brother Gary Atkins I said cramp this morning but Gary Atkins said one time you know if we read it different we read it th shalt not kill Thou shalt not steal see like a mean something if you read a little different say I shall not steal changes the whole thing though made it from a bunch of works that we thought was saving and that's what they thought they thought keeping the Commandments that's what people think if they pave the parking lot they going to heaven that's putting it over here today see if they give this or help this or do that then that's the works that they've come up with but Ain nothing wrong with P the par I mean somebody don't go to church where you might do it but we make the word of God works instead of making it a revelation right read that thou shalt not steal and then say well you know since God came in my heart I don't desire to steal no more you know that we are the only people that can keep the 10 commandments right I tried to explain that one time a born again Christian is the only one that can really keep the Commandments but it's not because we have to is we do it because we want to that's right then we understand yes you know and that's where Jesus would get into trouble went down to there one day and this this the disciples was going along plucking corn you know they rub it with their hand and just eating it you a't never done that corn that was pretty good you know I like it better baked or bowed or something but and they got on to him said you're you're disciples are do it he said well is it not even written that David went in and ate the shoe bread and was blameless why because he was hungry and hunger goes over the brother but now David didn't go behind the veil get that straight he didn't go behind the veil and get the the Mana that was in there don't get those two together the shoe bread you study it the shoe bread was out here on the outside and the Mana was in behind the veil David never went behind the veil got it he went in here and got the shoe bread that was for the priest to eat but you see the scripture says if you're going down through you walk through a field of cor you can pull the corn off and eat it but one stipulation you can't take none with you you can sit down and eat your belly full but you don't take a stock of corn or a grain of corn with you that was and Jesus said that's what he was getting to the Pharisees you know that you're out here talking about them when the Bible says they can do it the Bible was right it's wonderful the law was right it was spiritual Paul said that's right but ual man trying to interpret it made it works this message that I said one this morning when I started did I've heard people preaching going to hell for two Stone shoes you know or something like that what's that got to do with it it matter about us whether it's two tone or not we was lucky even have that's right you we would rais up like a l you that know was you was doing you had all you needed I mean uh we got a pair of shoes and the fall and they had to last to Spring of the year for some time then you didn't need them until the fall came you get with one a year you know brother Brandon when I first heard him said who's next he like I first heard him say that I like cuz I've stun it he said when he running down to they go into that swimming pool with with his buddies you know said all he had to do was pull a nail he just had one of his guses across and had a nail sticking in see you're you most you Ain know nothing to know about that or you was wealthy enough to stay away from I mean when the button fell off what was you going to do you got your nail slid it through the sucker and K it you know anybody um when it says for if you love them which love you what reward have you do not even the publicans the same I'm assuming that was the best example Jesus could give during that time they probably were it was the best example they were the people who always wanted uh to be rewarded I think in public and all that that was the best example do all the time they were doing their religion you know and doing it you know even the publicans you say it's good to do this even the publicans do that cuz the natural guy he looked at the publicans and I'm astonished uh you know the normal people in the congregation look at the pastor so they were looking back there at to fical leaders and you see a fical leader that didn't live right you didn't want be a part of it so everybody might lie of the F of the publicans or something because they were Hypocrites most of the time you that was just like brother Danny there last night a man he prayed and and the manide of him said did you pray he he said yes he said well I didn't hear you like way told him he order told him man said well I wasn't talking to you talking to the lord well you know maybe the guy wasn't trying to be sarcastic that's his business but if he was a religious sarcastic person see then he was condemn him because he walked in the place you know like used to when they you know you always watching preachers when they'd go in the door back in the old days you know they didn't say I I I want a nonsmoking sex they walk in me W up gang one night they come walking it got come in I said he's a preacher I want not smoking he want everybody in the building know he's preacher well he's got his reward I know the quotes from brother brandom and the quotes from Billy Paul not all of them but Billy Paul said his daddy told him one day he said Billy did that God hear you you he come in late from getting L you know he just about his head and said his Blessing he said God hear you I didn't hear you well I don't think brother Brandon meant that Billy was supposed to get the microphone and say it over again do you right maybe Billy wasn't sincere when he said right with those words you know we condemn each other on everything anybody else before we go it's already 4:00 I'm sorry if you will take the the the one home that says some comments you know take it home and read it I thoroughly enjoyed it I've read it over two or three times you know and I I fully agree as far as I understand what the person was trying to say in the things because that's what I was trying to say you know said the comments about what it is in other words the comment was the Lord Jesus Christ was manifested short of word of the devil whose job is to discredit the word to the word to PRT us seeing it or prevent you us seeing it revealed that's a good point read them all whosoever is born of God does not sin does not commit sin the word is revealed to him so he cannot disbelieve it's good point right down the line I don't I don't find anything in here that would be in any form that's what I was going to just read all of them and and have it a Christian does Christian who goes out and does wrong has sin imputed to his body and spirit not his soul see I like that that what I was trying to explain you so go read them you know and then you know appreciate let stand together what you come anybody has a need s to be a little ly but it won't be get that out of the way really wanted to read that but then you get into talking and preaching and doing and know we certainly do appreciate the kids these kids they do a wonderful job leading singing and singing and having a good time and you know and their learning so then we appreciate it come on B unless you don't if you don't want to we don't all right what do we got to S page 35 Love Lifted Me Love sing and worship appreciate these kids get them in trained and and get them right get them to go goad anybody have a need the altar is open anybody have a need let Saving Grace be revealed to us at the revelation of Jesus Christ not disgrace Grace curious TR father my brother B while we go hunting things we good time his the master sing the me in me all ever his might the and so true there is my soul brother weal we don't have to that anybody else the he he say just think about it what God has done for you and I that's right made us his children that's the most wonderful thing you could ever think of but in this age to send us the message of the that's right that would be the truth that shall set us free we learn what these things are what life is and do it just by simply believe in God's word what about it he's mindful of all of the things I like what brother Theo rasman said about that scripture he said see there said his mind is just full of us that's a good point that he's mindful of us he can't forget us because he agreed to look on these things remember us this week just pray that the Lord would bless us and we' have a good time amen fell shipping together we look forward to it remember eron as it be bringing the the message Wednesday pray one for another that the Lord May bless us all in him
