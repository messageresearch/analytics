[0:04] this is here for a reason
[0:13] yes I think I accidentally put that
[0:16] there
[0:22] all right so
[0:29] um
[0:32] so I've got another
[0:34] picture up here
[0:36] symbolize the communion because that's
[0:38] the topic this is the fourth and and
[0:40] maybe today we'll kind of have a
[0:42] different idea of or communion will mean
[0:45] a lot more to us when we take it this
[0:46] afternoon because you know comedian is
[0:49] not just the Lord's suppress it's being
[0:51] able to commune with God and think his
[0:53] thoughts and being able to talk to him
[0:55] and understand one another and that's
[0:57] what God is doing as he as he builds us
[1:00] Brick by Brick precept comb precept here
[1:03] a little there little by his word so
[1:05] that we can we can enter into full
[1:06] communion with it
[1:08] um so I want to turn to John chapter 14.
[1:11] and well I've got it right here so you
[1:13] don't you don't necessarily have to turn
[1:15] but but this is this scripture is kind
[1:18] of talking about the direction that I'm
[1:21] going to go in this class
[1:22] so uh before we read it let's go to the
[1:25] Lord in prayer real quick Lord Jesus we
[1:27] thank you God for your grace to us today
[1:29] Lord God I pray that you'll open our
[1:30] hearts to know more about you and to see
[1:32] you more with Jesus God I pray you to
[1:35] bless the service this morning with
[1:36] brother where you Lord that you'll bless
[1:38] him Lord and cause him Lord Jesus to
[1:40] speak exactly what you'd have until Lord
[1:42] granted Lord that he will help us Lord
[1:44] Jesus to understand you more and bless
[1:47] the ones that couldn't be here today
[1:48] Lord the ones that are sick and
[1:49] Afflicted Lord and just be with us all
[1:51] we pray
[1:52] in the name of all Jesus Christ amen now
[1:56] John 14 1-3 says let not your heart be
[2:00] troubled
[2:01] ye believe in God believe also in me
[2:05] in my father's house are many mansions
[2:07] if it were not so
[2:09] I would have told you I go to prepare a
[2:13] place for you now when brother Brown was
[2:15] breaking this down he begins to talk
[2:16] about how the God Was preparing it's
[2:18] like uh he talked about then when you
[2:21] when you got the new birth it wasn't as
[2:23] though all of a sudden God started
[2:25] thinking about you but he was thinking
[2:26] about you all alone he's like hey and he
[2:28] compared it to when you have a child
[2:30] when when a mother's pregnant and then
[2:33] she gives birth you don't wait until the
[2:35] baby's born to start preparing but you
[2:38] start getting everything ready you get
[2:39] the crib and all the diapers and
[2:41] everything all ready and laid out way
[2:44] before the child was born you start
[2:45] cleaning and that's exactly how God
[2:47] thinks of us he's he's from the from the
[2:50] day you were born before you were born
[2:53] he he already knew that that he would
[2:57] have wanted he knew all about you he
[2:58] knew everything and because he's the
[3:01] same yesterday today and forever he can
[3:03] never have a new thought and that's what
[3:04] kind of stumbles people about
[3:06] predestination you kind of almost think
[3:08] that that he's got somewhere somewhere
[3:11] back there he had he all of a sudden
[3:12] thought about you but no he he never has
[3:15] any thought it's it's uh because he's
[3:18] he's the unchanging God so he always
[3:20] knew that she was one and that's how he
[3:23] he had everything laid out for you so
[3:26] that uh
[3:27] one day that special moment when you
[3:30] heard the word and something just came
[3:33] alive and and it was it was like
[3:35] everything was just laid out one day you
[3:37] hear this minister of preach this
[3:39] particular thing and you would be in a
[3:41] particular place when you heard it and
[3:43] even look at brother Graham's life how
[3:45] everything all through the Old Testament
[3:47] all the all the people in the Old
[3:48] Testament their lives were it was like
[3:50] it was just uh all planned out all the
[3:52] dates and times and numbers and
[3:54] everything is just perfectly uh in in
[3:56] sync well that's how much God thinks of
[3:59] us
[3:59] so I go to prepare a place for you and
[4:02] if I go and prepare a place for you I
[4:04] will come again and receive you unto
[4:06] myself that where I am a very he may be
[4:09] also because God wants fellowship with
[4:11] us
[4:12] he wants to commune with us he wants us
[4:15] to be where he is and and that's what
[4:18] where where is he now he's one one day
[4:21] that New Jerusalem is going to come down
[4:24] we're not we're not so much going to to
[4:28] another place but that New Jerusalem is
[4:30] going to come because it said it came
[4:32] from God out of heaven in Revelations it
[4:34] came down to earth and that's what the
[4:36] coming of the Lord is the coming of the
[4:38] Lord is God Bringing Down to Earth
[4:39] himself
[4:41] and uh
[4:44] I got I got a lot of material to cover
[4:47] so let me try I'm gonna try to move fast
[4:48] here but let's just start reading
[4:50] through some quotes what's what's God
[4:52] doing he says over the other one is
[4:54] called my father's house I'll go and
[4:55] prepare a place for you take you out of
[4:57] this pest house and deliver you into my
[4:59] father's house so there you are take you
[5:01] out of this old Earthly pest house he's
[5:03] gone to prepare a perfect place
[5:05] for no evil exists no sickness exists no
[5:08] old age exist no death exists it's a
[5:11] perfect place calling you to that
[5:13] Perfection and you have to be perfect to
[5:15] get there and we know what whether
[5:18] Perfection is when you get the bad when
[5:21] you when you're born again
[5:23] when you're born again uh you know you
[5:25] can enter into that and enter into the
[5:27] joys that that's prepared and and all
[5:29] those things but what we're striving for
[5:32] is something that nobody else has ever
[5:34] done in the history of the Earth or you
[5:36] know except for you know Enoch and and
[5:38] Elijah but that's to take a body change
[5:40] for our bodies to be changed and to take
[5:43] a Rapture and so that's what
[5:47] oh
[5:49] let me finish reading this quote so how
[5:51] can you do it through anything else but
[5:53] the perfect word of God which is the
[5:54] Waters of Separation that washes us from
[5:56] our sins amen that's right the blood of
[5:58] Jesus Christ think of it the dripping
[6:01] bloody word the blood the word of God
[6:03] bleeding blood to wash the bride in you
[6:06] can't do it through anything else
[6:07] besides the word of God and I've been
[6:09] reading through the adoption here he
[6:10] said he keeps stressing over and over
[6:12] how you got to stay with the word don't
[6:14] try to get your own idea or anything
[6:16] because it's that's what Nimrod did
[6:19] that's what kush did and that and threw
[6:21] everything off and and God's gonna have
[6:22] to come and destroy everything that they
[6:25] have to bring in a new kingdom to bring
[6:28] us back into perfect communion with him
[6:30] to bring everything back into perfect
[6:31] communion that the the world system the
[6:34] uh the bride the the whole Cosmos okay
[6:41] it's not by knowledge God isn't known by
[6:43] theology or education
[6:46] knowledge takes a man away from God
[6:48] faith it brings him to God that's what
[6:50] separated him from God In the Garden of
[6:52] Eden he went into the tree of knowledge
[6:56] and the pillar of fire he says but God's
[6:58] not known by education God's known by
[7:00] faith God's not known by knowledge man
[7:03] left the Tree of Life to eat the tree of
[7:05] knowledge and he's separating himself
[7:07] from God and ever since then by
[7:09] knowledge he's drove himself away from
[7:11] God God is not known by knowledge he's
[7:13] known by faith
[7:15] and it because because knowledge takes
[7:17] us out of communion with God you try to
[7:20] follow your what you think and it just
[7:22] takes you further away from what God the
[7:24] the message that God's really trying to
[7:26] bring right and and you know people have
[7:28] taken that and said well the education
[7:30] is bad education is bad if you use that
[7:33] to take it up take it off to take you
[7:35] you know to to try to figure out God's
[7:37] God's word but you know when we're down
[7:40] here it's you pretty much just to
[7:43] survive you've got to have education you
[7:45] gotta you gotta you know you gotta even
[7:48] if you're a mechanic somebody's got to
[7:49] show you how to fix a car or whatever
[7:50] that's that's education so we're don't
[7:53] go too far off the off the track you
[7:55] know
[7:57] the Feast of the trumpets in 1964 he
[8:00] said but the bride can walk with the
[8:01] word which is Christ remember last time
[8:03] we were talking about how real communion
[8:05] is being able to walk like Abraham God
[8:07] said walk before me and be thou perfect
[8:09] and
[8:10] and God came down and told Brother
[8:12] random walk with me down the mountain
[8:14] After the Storm was calm well and he
[8:15] said that'd be the greatest desire that
[8:17] I have that'd be the greatest honor to
[8:19] walk with you the bride can walk with
[8:21] the word which is Christ it must be an
[8:22] agreement not the ecclesiastical system
[8:25] but the word
[8:26] in agreement now doesn't mean not in
[8:29] your head anybody could I can go out to
[8:30] a homeless person and say do you agree
[8:31] with what brown said in these books and
[8:33] they I'm sure I agree but being in
[8:35] agreement is having that life live
[8:37] inside of you having have it in manifest
[8:40] and not just not in your head because
[8:41] anybody can sit in church and say I
[8:43] agree with what the preacher's saying
[8:45] and I have a clue what they're talking
[8:46] about right but agreement is when when
[8:48] it's revealed to you when it's when
[8:50] spirit and Truth come together and then
[8:52] you can agree right and that's one
[8:56] that's well let me just stop there
[9:00] I'm gonna get on something
[9:02] communion
[9:04] now see
[9:07] when we're getting these communion
[9:09] messages the brother Brown just said
[9:10] some some just wonderful things well
[9:13] that's what many times that we do in the
[9:14] spiritual realm you see each day we've
[9:16] got to commune with Christ we've got to
[9:18] talk to him each day and we've got to
[9:20] settle with it settle it with him each
[9:22] day Paul said I die each day each day I
[9:25] die yet I live not me but Christ lives
[9:27] in me so if your physical body needs
[9:29] food each day and drink each day to
[9:31] survive your spiritual body needs
[9:33] spiritual food and communion with the
[9:34] Lord each day to survive all right
[9:37] how can you how can you say you're
[9:38] communing with God and never read your
[9:40] Bible and never pray you said that's
[9:41] what the program said that uh a real
[9:43] Christian reasons the Bible and prays
[9:44] every day because that's how you grow
[9:45] that's how you grow up the stature
[9:47] perfect man that's how you become more
[9:48] closer to God and More in communion with
[9:50] them and comedian uh that same sermon he
[9:53] appeared to Eve as an angel of Light so
[9:55] for sure the Lord said this the Lord
[9:57] said this but he disagreed with God
[9:58] right at the end and that's the way
[10:00] false comedian does today when people
[10:02] think they're praying to God
[10:04] I won't obey the word as a false
[10:07] comedian and that was his definition of
[10:09] the Antichrist the Antichrist says yeah
[10:11] I'm sure I agree with the word but won't
[10:12] obey the word if you come to church and
[10:14] Nod your head and say yeah yeah I agree
[10:17] but won't obey won't line up whatever
[10:19] word then something's wrong something
[10:21] that that's not real convenient
[10:24] and identified Masterpiece of God it's
[10:27] God to agree with the word if your
[10:29] spirit and you won't punctuate every one
[10:31] of God's promises with amen
[10:33] there is something wrong
[10:38] and communion this is this is the last
[10:40] month that he preached um
[10:44] now we find out today that this great
[10:46] thing that we're feasible to do tonight
[10:47] in commemoration of his death in his
[10:49] body that we believe that we eat daily
[10:51] or just got through eating as our
[10:53] brother preached to us taking the word
[10:55] of God we believe it with all our heart
[10:57] we believe it
[10:58] when it comes to take a meeting you
[11:00] believe it and
[11:02] we see it manifesting we see it given to
[11:06] us we see God's God's life being
[11:08] manifested into it that's why I was
[11:10] stressing last time that it's the life
[11:11] of God you say well I agree with it but
[11:13] the life of God's not made manifest in
[11:15] me uh double check are you really in
[11:17] communion with God because uh
[11:20] we kind of stress so much the word the
[11:23] word but the word is a person and we
[11:25] don't want to just leave the word on the
[11:26] page we want to take it up and let it
[11:28] make it be manifest in our lives that's
[11:30] the whole point of the Gospel that that
[11:32] the truth will be anointed by the spirit
[11:34] and it will be it would come alive and
[11:37] and and getting us get into some good
[11:39] things right there we see it manifest we
[11:42] see it given to us we see and Vindicated
[11:44] we feel it in our lives and that's real
[11:48] comedian
[11:49] for that same message uh let's come down
[11:51] here what we need is some Thoroughbred
[11:53] Christians born under the blood of the
[11:54] Lord Jesus they'll live not off of
[11:56] church theology but off of the word of
[11:58] God the communion with Christ
[12:01] look at this this sounds like something
[12:03] the word coming into the believer his
[12:06] spiritual body is built up that's right
[12:09] yeah does that sound like the statue of
[12:12] perfect
[12:17] communion what we need is God's
[12:20] inoculation by the word of the Lord God
[12:22] to do what to give us immunity from the
[12:25] devil right man shall live daily by that
[12:28] kind of a food to build his soul into
[12:29] inoculation from spiritual diseases
[12:30] that's floating up around the country
[12:32] now build up get ready for the
[12:33] inoculation now we live by this our
[12:35] bodies must have this and and let me
[12:38] just jump down you can't have life only
[12:40] through Christ and now what does his
[12:41] word do
[12:43] it builds up our spiritual body strong
[12:46] as we commune with him that's right to
[12:49] resist the devil that's right you say
[12:51] brother Brandon what's that you say
[12:53] communing in his word yes he is the word
[12:55] in the beginning was the word and the
[12:56] words with God and the Word was God and
[12:58] the world made flesh and dwelt among us
[13:00] and we are to eat his body then his body
[13:03] is his word because he is the word and
[13:06] he said in John 15 if you abide in me
[13:09] and my communion my word abides in you
[13:11] then you can ask what you will and he'll
[13:12] be done for you there you are that's
[13:14] true see ask what you will
[13:16] you know real Community even in a family
[13:19] life if a husband and a wife I think the
[13:21] real evidence of a real comedian is when
[13:23] they share the checkbook now that's
[13:25] what's happening right here you know
[13:27] brother man always use that time that
[13:28] type yeah I have a neighbor that that
[13:30] one time he came home after he'd been
[13:33] traveling for a long time and his wife
[13:34] left him and and took all his money and
[13:37] and just took everything because they
[13:39] weren't inconvenient you share the
[13:42] checkbook you share that account and
[13:43] you're not a communion now I'm not
[13:45] trying to meddle here I'm just trying to
[13:46] you know brother Brandon always talked
[13:47] about he told uh up when you get into
[13:50] adoption where you can write the check
[13:53] and you put your own name on it because
[13:55] that's real communion when God can trust
[13:58] you with the checkbook you see if ye
[14:01] abide in me in my communion my word
[14:03] abides in you because you're speaking
[14:04] the same language you know what he wants
[14:06] and he can trust you with the bank
[14:08] account then you can ask what you will
[14:10] and it'll be done for you there you are
[14:13] that's true see ask what you will
[14:16] what it is it's got to be a fellowship
[14:18] and not a fellowship of some Creed or
[14:20] even to the written words got to be
[14:22] quickened by the Holy Spirit not much no
[14:23] matter how much theology you've got it's
[14:25] laying there did I could have a handful
[14:26] of weed until he gets into the process
[14:28] to where it can be quicker and the work
[14:30] the weak will never live and he's
[14:32] talking about how this the spirit has to
[14:33] Quicken the word that you've heard
[14:35] there's got to be the spirit and the
[14:37] truth coming together to make it alive
[14:39] and that's something I'm going to get
[14:42] into maybe a little bit long uh further
[14:44] along but Paul being well trained in a
[14:46] new description by the word but you see
[14:48] the scriptures as much as Paul knew all
[14:50] Scriptures it hadn't been quickened to
[14:51] him no matter how well you know them if
[14:54] the spirit doesn't Quicken and then the
[14:55] letter kill him because that that brings
[14:57] us into communion when the spirit comes
[14:59] down it makes the world alive together
[15:01] you begin to see what it's talking about
[15:02] that's why you're not you're not
[15:04] supposed to take my brother Wade
[15:05] mentioned that in one of his his lessons
[15:07] you don't take communion before you got
[15:09] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new
[15:10] birth because you're not you're not in
[15:12] sync with what God wants
[15:31] we are his body right and if I had time
[15:35] I was gonna I was gonna read that
[15:36] scripture but but we'll see how much
[15:38] time we have left
[15:40] God keeps his word I tell you the reason
[15:43] I love to hear Brother Neville speak not
[15:44] mainly because he's a good preacher
[15:46] but because I know that it is right
[15:53] I thought I had another one oh there it
[15:55] is communion this is where in comedian
[15:58] 1963 he says you know uh and remember we
[16:02] want to be constantly be in prayer and
[16:03] above all things watch your life
[16:05] if your life don't tell you what God's
[16:07] holding us then go back and start
[16:09] praying again
[16:10] there's something wrong see we must live
[16:12] in that kind of a state that the fruits
[16:13] of the spirit will make itself known
[16:14] through us that's what we want to live
[16:17] and I'm not talking about a kind of
[16:19] priest that kind of thing where you just
[16:20] say like these days they're like well
[16:22] we'll just let homosexuality and
[16:24] whatever in the church or whatever and
[16:25] just just love everybody that's not the
[16:27] love of God we're talking about these
[16:29] the the life of God being made manifest
[16:31] out of something that the world can't
[16:32] imitate because it's God and flesh
[16:34] there's something wrong see we must live
[16:36] in that kind of a state that the fruits
[16:38] of the spirit will make itself known to
[16:39] us that's what we want to live you know
[16:41] sometimes we hear great preachers who
[16:43] can preach mighty
[16:45] but
[16:47] we'd rather see a sermon lived then we
[16:50] would heard one priest see because
[16:52] that's the evidence that God is on the
[16:55] inside that's right amen that's what I
[16:57] was talking about last time he said it
[16:59] he said
[17:03] the rejected King there's something
[17:05] about men and women that they long to be
[17:07] like one another and that's that's kind
[17:09] of what I'm getting at with Nimrod here
[17:11] he comes up and he he messes up the
[17:14] communion between between man and God
[17:17] whenever you see a minister or somebody
[17:19] trying to get in the middle and make
[17:21] everybody look at them instead see if if
[17:24] you look at me then I'm still growing up
[17:26] a stack your man and that will
[17:28] hinder your growth but the example is
[17:31] Christ that's what we all look at right
[17:34] that's the model when God and his
[17:36] brother around preached that message the
[17:38] Masterpiece he was his model for
[17:40] creating the Masterpiece is himself
[17:43] he's molding us into his image molding
[17:46] us and and chipping off by the word By
[17:49] The Sword of the word all the stuff
[17:50] that's not supposed to be there until
[17:52] it's there's something there that that
[17:54] he can look at and say this is my
[17:56] masterpiece there's only been one man
[17:58] ever lived on Earth that was our example
[18:00] and that was the one that died for us
[18:01] all our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he
[18:04] was the perfect example of what we
[18:06] should be always about the father's
[18:08] business and doing that which is right
[18:10] always obeying the word if somebody if
[18:13] somebody shows you the word and it's
[18:15] revealed to you and you see it then you
[18:18] better line up with it
[18:21] now
[18:22] let's go back to where we were last time
[18:24] and I'm gonna have got 10 minutes God
[18:28] bless Noah and his sons instead of and
[18:30] be fruitful and multiply and replace the
[18:32] earth does that sound similar for me
[18:33] that's that's what he told Adam and Eve
[18:35] that's what he that was his Great
[18:36] Commission going into all the world and
[18:39] preach the gospel to Every Nation
[18:41] spread it around
[18:43] be fruitful and multiply and replace the
[18:45] Earth and when you get to akusha Nimrod
[18:47] they they did not want to spread the
[18:50] gospel this the truth around there if
[18:52] they want what they ended up doing was
[18:53] was uh taking uh staying in one place
[18:57] and building the city and building a
[19:00] tower around their knowledge around what
[19:01] they thought God wanted to do and and
[19:04] Chris being The Interpreter of the Gods
[19:06] of what he was known as he he started
[19:08] this this Doctrine first first It came
[19:11] it comes at his little Antichrist
[19:14] spirit I think I think this is gonna
[19:15] this is the way we should go and then he
[19:17] he started the saying where Nimrod was
[19:20] crowned uh Nimrod with candy King and
[19:23] and he began to be a mighty one of the
[19:24] earth and Genesis 10 8. so and Genesis
[19:28] 10 verses 10 through 11 it says the
[19:30] beginning of his kingdom was Babel
[19:32] that's where everything started at
[19:33] Nimrod and Eric and Acadia County and
[19:36] the land of shine are out of that land
[19:38] went for actually building Nineveh and
[19:40] the city we hop up in color now if you
[19:43] look in the history of two battle ones
[19:44] and in this in the church age book it
[19:46] says that this is actually a
[19:47] mistranslation that Asher doesn't isn't
[19:49] somebody it means that he got he started
[19:52] his little thing going on at around
[19:54] Babylon he got strong once he
[19:56] strengthened himself he went out and and
[19:58] uh built nilva and all his other cities
[20:01] so this is how Alexander Hislop says
[20:04] that all that Landing went for him being
[20:05] made strong uh when he had been made
[20:07] strong Asher and building enema
[20:11] built this big tower now there he is
[20:13] they're supposed to be in nimrod
[20:16] and what is what's he doing he's going
[20:18] around making people fall prostate
[20:20] before him
[20:21] see that look at me instead of looking
[20:25] at God and moving around seeing what
[20:27] they what they do is they'll they'll uh
[20:29] see this continued all the way down
[20:31] through through Modern Age where the
[20:34] papal Rome instead of letting the the
[20:37] Spirit-filled spirit-led church people
[20:40] put in pastors uh voting somebody that
[20:42] they believe is is a man of God
[20:46] or or run the church by the spirit then
[20:49] this this this uh papal organization
[20:53] they'll they put in like uh somebody I
[20:56] was talking to a church at work that's a
[20:58] that's a Catholic he was saying that
[20:59] every couple of years they'll put in a
[21:01] new priests it's their own Catholic
[21:03] hierarchy they'll they'll figure out who
[21:05] needs to go where who needs to because
[21:07] they've taken out the leading of the
[21:08] spirit and they've just put in theology
[21:10] they they have a little bit of Truth
[21:13] maybe but it's not quickened by the
[21:14] spirits know what to do right
[21:18] now in Jeremiah over 50 where we were we
[21:20] were reading earlier all this has got to
[21:22] be torn down
[21:23] all this has got to be is it's got to be
[21:25] it's got to be destroyed and that's what
[21:27] that stone that came out of the mountain
[21:29] does it it takes this this system that
[21:32] went down from from that head of gold to
[21:35] the the uh feed of iron and Clay it's
[21:37] all got to be destroyed to make way for
[21:39] for God's kingdom to come into being and
[21:43] that's what I'm what I'm com I'm going
[21:45] to be comparing in a few moments is is
[21:47] the goal of nimrod had he had three big
[21:49] goals and the goal that Christ had
[21:51] because he has three big goals they got
[21:54] that really talked about in Christ The
[21:55] Mystery of God are real and and they're
[21:57] they're uh there's very similar goals
[22:00] and very interesting so um
[22:04] foreign
[22:06] this is this is the story of the Tower
[22:09] of Babel and this is
[22:11] uh this is this is nimrod's three big
[22:13] girls a whole earth was of one language
[22:15] and a one speak everybody's in agreement
[22:16] as much as they can be and his three
[22:18] goals were built to build a city and a
[22:20] tower
[22:21] whose top May Return To Heaven
[22:24] he wanted to and let us make a name he
[22:26] wanted to make a name for himself he
[22:27] wanted to set up a kingdom and he wanted
[22:30] to start a religion
[22:33] not based upon God's word but and and
[22:36] these are all things brother Brandon
[22:37] said I'll show you the quote in a second
[22:38] he want to set up build a city and Tower
[22:40] who's taught me reach into heaven and
[22:42] let us make a name unless we be
[22:43] scattered abroad upon the face of the
[22:45] whole Earth but God told me to multiply
[22:47] go go around spread the gospel and
[22:49] that's exactly what the opposite of what
[22:50] you want to do because he's claiming
[22:52] that he's interpreting the word I'll
[22:54] tell you what God wants you to do
[22:56] and just go on it totally against see
[22:59] how important it is to stay perfectly
[23:01] with God's word all through this the
[23:03] road around the sermons he just
[23:04] reiterates that over and over just do
[23:06] what God tells you stay with his word
[23:08] and to really stay with his word he got
[23:10] to be inconvenience amen you've got to
[23:12] be inconvenient to know what his word is
[23:13] all about
[23:15] and the Lord came down to see the city
[23:17] of the tower which the children have
[23:18] been building and the Lord said behold
[23:20] the people was one and they all have one
[23:21] language and this they begin to do
[23:23] they're they're building a tower not
[23:25] based upon his God God's word but upon
[23:27] knowledge
[23:28] go let us let us go down there confound
[23:30] their language they might may not
[23:32] understand one another speech so the
[23:33] Lord scattered them abroad from this
[23:35] poem the face of all the Earth which is
[23:37] exactly according to his original plan
[23:39] in Genesis 9.
[23:41] and they left off to build a city
[23:43] therefore is it is the name of it called
[23:45] battles because the Lord didn't confound
[23:48] the language of all the Earth
[23:50] so I'm just I have some quotes about
[23:53] this in the original you know in the
[23:55] early ages of mankind they everybody
[23:57] believed in one soul and omnip indeed
[23:59] and you created all things
[24:02] and bail was known as that um founder
[24:05] now now remember what that scripture in
[24:08] Jeremiah 50 that we just read Jeremiah
[24:10] 52 that says Baal will be confounded Now
[24:13] isn't it interesting that that compound
[24:14] or the one that takes God's word and
[24:16] messes it all up with his with his with
[24:19] his hammer with his with his Club
[24:21] because he had the club was the symbol
[24:23] of bell he is the one that in the end
[24:25] God's Gonna Come found him
[24:27] God's gonna take everything that he did
[24:30] and just and and destroy the same way
[24:32] that he thought he thought he was going
[24:34] to take God's word and set up something
[24:35] else something something greater so Baal
[24:38] is known as a confounder the Bell or
[24:40] Kush the father of nimrod originally was
[24:42] the Ringling to lay the people away from
[24:43] the true God encourage the people as The
[24:45] Interpreter of the Gods to take another
[24:47] form of religion
[24:49] uh he's known as the god of confusion
[24:52] that's where chaos can be all these
[24:53] Greek gods and things of Mars and all
[24:56] that stuff they all came from from Kush
[24:58] and Nimrod uh he's known as Marduk
[25:02] Nimrod and and that's where the the
[25:04] planet Mars comes from the god Mars all
[25:07] this stuff comes from Kiss Kush and
[25:09] Nimrod because they set up that all of
[25:11] the Pagan religions started back there
[25:13] with with uh Kush and Nimrod setting up
[25:16] this thing that was contrary to God's
[25:17] word and his symbol is a clue remember
[25:19] that scripture that I told you to
[25:21] remember the hammer okay he took his
[25:23] club and and destroyed God's word with
[25:25] him and now God's gonna take in the at
[25:28] the end time this what he's doing now
[25:30] his whole process is a destroy the works
[25:33] of the devil that through through this
[25:35] system that that came down that started
[25:37] back then the the confounder that symbol
[25:40] is a club and the name of a club account
[25:41] he comes from the very word which
[25:43] signifies to break in pieces or scatter
[25:45] abroad
[25:46] and he reserved he did teach everything
[25:48] he reserved stuff that's you know but I
[25:52] I strongly believe in just just telling
[25:54] everybody just if you got it just tell
[25:56] it you know because that's the opposite
[25:58] of what um and I'm going a little bit
[26:00] fast that's the opposite of what Nimrod
[26:02] did and there the the the the what they
[26:05] believe the Babylonian symbol of their
[26:06] Pagan symbol of God was this equilateral
[26:09] triangle it's so close to the truth
[26:12] so close
[26:15] I'm running out of town
[26:19] somebody told me somebody told me the
[26:22] funnest the funnest thing about watching
[26:23] my sentence collectors when I start to
[26:25] run out of time
[26:40] they take this and and and and use that
[26:43] to say it represents the Trinity three
[26:45] gods and one but it's really uh and and
[26:49] this see this is the lat or the Greek
[26:51] for um I am that I am so yeah it's so
[26:54] close
[26:57] uh not we
[27:13] yeah I might have to uh
[27:17] Let's see we got we got one more minute
[27:19] let me see if I can uh he he tried to
[27:21] force it down everybody's throat he
[27:22] tried to he tried to cram it down there
[27:24] for him and
[27:27] um
[27:34] there's the image Daniel's now here's
[27:37] what I'm getting to I'm gonna I'm gonna
[27:38] hurry right through this
[27:40] Rome exists to the end because it went
[27:42] to the end of the toes and he seen bud
[27:43] and clay and as people what we're made
[27:45] out of and iron the strength of Rome
[27:46] running every one of those Nations
[27:48] that's that
[27:49] that's that girl and all these all these
[27:52] uh world powers that came down Through
[27:54] the Ages until you get to the bottom
[27:55] that's today is these 10 these 10 uh the
[27:59] Roman system is just extended all
[28:01] throughout the world
[28:03] and God's Gonna there's a stone that
[28:05] came out of the mountain to destroy it
[28:07] and I'm I'm going fast
[28:12] you know what I'm not gonna hurt through
[28:14] this we're just doing next time yeah I
[28:17] think that would be a better option
