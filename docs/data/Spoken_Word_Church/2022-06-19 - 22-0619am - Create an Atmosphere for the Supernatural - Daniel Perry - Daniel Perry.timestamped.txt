[21:55] and the bible says the hand of the lord
[21:57] was upon me and carried me out into this
[22:01] carried me out in the spirit of the lord
[22:03] and set me down in the midst of the
[22:05] valley
[22:06] which was full of bones
[22:09] and caused me to pass
[22:11] by them
[22:13] round about and behold there were
[22:16] very many in the open valley and lo they
[22:19] were very dry
[22:21] and he said unto me son of man son of
[22:24] man unto you be ashamed
[22:27] and confound oh wait i'm sorry son of
[22:29] man can these bones live
[22:32] and i answered o lord god thou knowest
[22:36] again he said unto me prophesy upon
[22:38] these bones and say unto them o ye dry
[22:42] bones
[22:43] hear the word of the lord
[22:45] thus saith the lord unto these bones
[22:47] behold i will cause breath to enter unto
[22:50] you
[22:51] and ye shall live
[22:53] and i will lay
[22:55] sueth
[22:56] upon you and will bring
[22:58] a flesh upon you
[23:01] and cover you with skin
[23:03] and put breath in you
[23:05] and ye shall live
[23:07] and ye shall know that i am the lord
[23:10] so i prophesied as i was commanded
[23:13] and i prophesied there was a noise and
[23:16] behold a shaking
[23:18] and the bones came together
[23:21] bone to his bone
[23:23] and when i beheld low the soups and the
[23:26] flesh came upon them and the skin
[23:29] covered them above
[23:31] there was no breath in them
[23:34] then he said unto me prophesy unto the
[23:36] wind prophesy son of man
[23:39] and say to the wind
[23:41] thus saith the lord god come from the
[23:43] four winds o breath
[23:45] and breathe upon these slain
[23:48] and they may live so i prophesied as he
[23:51] commanded me
[23:53] and the breath came upon them and they
[23:55] lived and stood up upon their feet an
[23:59] exceeding great army
[24:02] then he said unto me son of man these
[24:05] bones are the whole house of israel
[24:08] behold they say our bones are dried
[24:11] and our hope is lost
[24:13] we are cut off from part from our parts
[24:17] therefore prophesy and say unto them
[24:20] thus saith the lord
[24:22] behold o my people
[24:24] i will open your graves
[24:26] and cause you to come up out of your
[24:28] graves
[24:30] and bring you upon the land of israel
[24:32] and ye shall know that i am the lord
[24:36] when i have opened your graves o my
[24:38] people
[24:39] and brought you up out of your graves
[24:42] and ye shall and shall put my spirit in
[24:46] you
[24:47] and ye shall live
[24:49] and i shall place you in your own land
[24:52] then shall ye know that i i the lord
[24:55] have spoken it and performed it saith
[24:58] the lord
[25:00] amen
[25:03] and we're gonna jump over to
[25:06] first kings 18
[25:09] read a few scriptures here i apologize
[25:11] for the long scripture reading but
[25:14] i just want to lay a foundation before i
[25:16] get started
[25:22] first kings 18.
[25:28] we're gonna start at verse 29
[25:30] and we'll go on down
[25:39] you gotta say man
[25:43] and he answered
[25:46] i'm sorry
[25:47] 18 verse 29
[25:49] and it came to pass
[25:52] when midday was passed
[25:54] and they prophesied until the time
[25:57] of the offering of the evening sacrifice
[26:00] that there was neither voice nor any
[26:04] to answer
[26:05] nor any that regarded
[26:08] and elijah said unto all the people come
[26:10] near unto me
[26:12] and all the people came near unto him
[26:14] and he repaired the altar of the lord
[26:17] that was broken down
[26:19] and elijah took 12 stones
[26:22] according to the number of the tribes of
[26:24] the sons of jacob
[26:25] and unto the word of the lord came
[26:28] saying israel
[26:30] shall be thy name
[26:32] and with the stones he built an altar in
[26:35] the name of the lord
[26:37] and he made a trench about the altar was
[26:40] great which contained two
[26:43] measures of seed
[26:46] and he put the wood
[26:48] in order and cut the bullock in pieces
[26:51] and laid
[26:52] him
[26:53] on wood and said fill four barrels with
[26:56] water
[26:57] and pour it on the burnt sacrifice and
[27:00] on the wood
[27:01] and he said do it the second time and
[27:04] they did it the second time and he said
[27:07] do it the third time and they did it the
[27:10] third time
[27:12] and the water ran upon about the altar
[27:15] and he filled the trench
[27:17] also with water
[27:19] and it came to pass at the time of the
[27:21] offering of the evening sacrifice
[27:23] elijah the prophet
[27:25] came near and said lord god of abraham
[27:28] isaac and of israel let it be known this
[27:31] day
[27:32] that thou art that thou
[27:35] art god in israel and i am thy servant
[27:38] that i have done
[27:40] all these things at thy word
[27:43] hear me o lord hear me that these people
[27:46] may know that they'll thou art the lord
[27:48] god and that thou has turned their
[27:51] hearts back again
[27:53] then the fire of the lord fell and
[27:55] consumed the burnt sacrifice
[27:57] and the wood
[27:59] and the stone in the dust and licked up
[28:02] the water that was in the trench
[28:05] and when all the people saw
[28:07] they fell on their faces and they said
[28:09] lord god
[28:10] the lord he is the god and the lord he
[28:13] is the god amen this time we bow our
[28:16] heads
[28:17] lord jesus lord we just thank you lord
[28:18] for the lord just this opportunity lord
[28:21] once again
[28:22] lord to just lift up the name of jesus
[28:24] lord to give you praise lord and create
[28:27] an atmosphere lord of worship now lord
[28:30] we've read your word we pray that you
[28:32] quicken it lord move me out of the way
[28:34] oh god lord lord you speak to your
[28:37] people oh god lord you be the preacher
[28:39] this morning lord and you also be the
[28:40] hearer oh god in the name of jesus amen
[28:46] hey man you may be seated
[28:52] this morning i
[28:53] won't be before you long
[28:56] but this morning i want to preach on
[28:59] create an atmosphere for the
[29:00] supernatural
[29:02] and if i had to put a sub-topic to it
[29:05] it would be it's manifesting time
[29:09] and we see in the scriptures here in
[29:11] ezekiel
[29:12] that the lord asked ezekiel son of man
[29:15] can these bones live
[29:17] and
[29:19] we want to focus on the atmospheres this
[29:21] morning
[29:22] why did god ask ezekiel can these bones
[29:25] live
[29:27] if we if we want to know the answer to
[29:29] that we have to look
[29:31] at the atmosphere that was created
[29:34] before god ever spoke and asked that
[29:36] question to him
[29:38] and if we look at elijah we're gonna
[29:40] look at the same things this morning but
[29:42] god knew to ask ezekiel could these
[29:45] bones live
[29:46] why because he knew that whatever he put
[29:49] on the inside of him when that word came
[29:52] to him
[29:53] when the word came to his doorstep how
[29:56] he would respond to it
[29:58] same with same with elijah
[30:01] they they questioned god
[30:04] they asked you know they they they had
[30:07] their own image of the lord and they
[30:09] wanted to just forget about god
[30:12] so
[30:14] god elijah had faith in who his god was
[30:18] just like this day we should have faith
[30:20] in who god is
[30:22] [Applause]
[30:23] we look at the things that happened in
[30:25] brother branham's ministry
[30:27] and i don't know why but it seems like
[30:30] this day we don't think it could happen
[30:32] this day
[30:34] what brother branham spoke that though
[30:36] in the bible says that these very same
[30:38] works what happened
[30:41] that's what's going to have to take
[30:42] place this morning
[30:45] we're creating an atmosphere for the
[30:46] supernatural so elijah he had faith
[30:50] in who god was and he knew
[30:52] because he had a testimony because god
[30:55] had already shown him
[30:57] many times before that he was a god that
[31:00] would provide his every need
[31:03] that he was a god that would show up
[31:07] to prove his word
[31:10] god's word cannot fail
[31:12] the scripture says my word have i sent
[31:15] out and it shall not return to me void
[31:19] so elijah knew
[31:22] elijah knew that when he said
[31:25] that god was going to show up god had to
[31:28] do it
[31:30] god had to show up to perform his word
[31:34] so the scripture says that elijah began
[31:36] to
[31:37] prepare
[31:38] the to repair the altar
[31:41] so we know that this is an altar up here
[31:44] what do we do up here
[31:46] we worship
[31:48] we praise
[31:49] we create an atmosphere for god to move
[31:53] that's what we do
[31:55] so that same altar he began
[31:58] to repair it he began to it and you
[32:01] notice the scripture he did many
[32:04] impossible things
[32:07] fire
[32:08] can he he began to pour water not one
[32:11] not two but three times upon the altar
[32:16] because he knew that the fire of the
[32:17] lord was gonna come down
[32:20] but we know as humans
[32:22] that where there is that where something
[32:24] is in water
[32:25] fire cannot dwell upon it
[32:28] if you dread something and you try to
[32:30] set it on fire
[32:31] it won't catch on fire
[32:34] why
[32:35] because the two materials are not
[32:37] compatible
[32:40] so god loves to work in the impossible
[32:45] oh i'm trying not to get ahead of myself
[32:47] but god loves to work at the impossible
[32:49] he lets the situation in your life get
[32:52] so bad
[32:53] to where it seems like there's no hope
[32:56] when you don't know where that last
[32:58] dime's coming from or when you don't
[33:00] know where your meal is coming from
[33:02] then he shows up
[33:05] just to prove himself
[33:07] [Applause]
[33:19] so elijah created this impossible
[33:21] scenario
[33:23] and it wasn't just
[33:25] it wasn't just for elijah but it was the
[33:28] people
[33:29] who had strayed away from god
[33:32] and created an atmosphere of doubt
[33:34] surrounding what god would do
[33:37] when they seen time and time and time
[33:39] again how god had shown up to prove
[33:42] himself
[33:44] even at the red sea he showed up to
[33:47] prove himself
[33:50] he showed up to prove himself time and
[33:52] time again
[33:53] but still they got weary in their faith
[33:57] why
[33:59] they got weary in their faith
[34:03] so he begins to create this impossible
[34:05] scenario
[34:06] and god begin to move
[34:08] but notice
[34:10] a scripture says that elijah
[34:12] began basically to give worship to the
[34:15] lord
[34:16] in the midst of that he had already sent
[34:19] out a word he had already said what his
[34:20] god was going to do
[34:23] he wouldn't he didn't have to do nothing
[34:25] else
[34:26] but he created an atmosphere
[34:29] this morning today we need to create an
[34:32] atmosphere for the supernatural this
[34:34] morning the supernatural works aren't
[34:37] just in the scriptures supernatural
[34:39] works not just in brother branham they
[34:41] should happen right now
[34:43] brother branham said when the bride gets
[34:45] into position
[34:49] when the bride gets into position
[34:52] divine healings will take place
[34:55] the sick can be healed the dead will be
[34:57] raised
[34:58] we look all all through brother
[35:00] branham's ministry where people would
[35:02] come up in the prayer line and they
[35:04] would say
[35:05] well my loved one he's out in the world
[35:07] and i want them to be in church
[35:10] and what would happen
[35:12] as soon as they finish saying the prayer
[35:15] that loved one that they were praying
[35:16] for will walk through the door
[35:20] that would happen now
[35:22] that can happen now
[35:24] it's manifesting time
[35:26] it's time not to be playing church
[35:29] we should become
[35:30] what brother branham said we should be
[35:32] what the scriptures have told you what
[35:34] you are
[35:36] the scripture says now we are the sons
[35:38] of god
[35:41] and the scripture also says the works
[35:43] that i do you shall do also
[35:46] if any man believe on me
[35:49] the works that i do you shall do also
[35:57] it's manifest in time
[35:59] it's not time to be playing with the
[36:01] word the word have said what you are
[36:04] they have told you what you are but
[36:05] satan loves to make you doubt what you
[36:09] are
[36:10] he loves in the in the atmosphere of
[36:13] faith this morning there's an atmosphere
[36:15] of faith but in the in this myth
[36:19] there's an atmosphere of doubt also
[36:24] in this this morning in this presence
[36:27] there's an atmosphere of doubt
[36:30] why
[36:31] you ain't seen it in a while
[36:34] you ain't seen the move of god
[36:36] many people have walked away why
[36:38] because they were looking for the power
[36:44] everything
[36:45] that has happened this day people that
[36:48] have walked away from this word it
[36:50] happened in scripture
[36:52] when jesus began to talk to the people
[36:55] and tell them what was required of them
[36:57] they began to walk away why
[37:00] because they couldn't receive the word
[37:03] they couldn't understand it
[37:06] when he began to tell him that you can't
[37:08] you don't have no part with me if you
[37:10] don't eat my flesh and drink my blood
[37:12] but he began to talk to him they
[37:14] couldn't take the word but when he was
[37:17] performing miracles it was a great crowd
[37:22] when it was a great crowd when he began
[37:24] to heal the sick raise the dead
[37:28] but when it came to the word
[37:31] they couldn't handle it
[37:36] i'm gonna take a few examples we're
[37:38] gonna we're gonna we're gonna go through
[37:39] the bible this morning can y'all get can
[37:41] y'all preach with me this morning
[37:45] i'm gonna go off i'm not even gon i'm
[37:47] not even gonna bother with this this
[37:48] morning
[37:50] i'ma just follow the leadership of the
[37:51] lord
[37:52] [Music]
[37:54] but let's let's let's let's take some
[37:56] scriptures in the bible
[37:57] let's look at zacharias this morning how
[38:00] many know the story of zechariah
[38:02] how many know he was john the baptist's
[38:04] father amen
[38:07] brother branham said
[38:09] that the eighth the bible says that the
[38:11] angel of the lord came
[38:13] to zachariah and it began to give him a
[38:16] word
[38:17] now brother branham said that why would
[38:20] zechariah doubt that word
[38:22] when he had examples
[38:24] he had examples of the word he had
[38:27] hannah
[38:28] he had sarah
[38:30] him being a prophet he knew the word
[38:34] he knew
[38:36] what had been taking place so he knew
[38:38] that it wasn't impossible for that thing
[38:41] to happen or for god to perform it
[38:44] but then you then months later you got
[38:48] married the same angel came to her with
[38:50] the same word
[38:53] but let's look at the atmospheres this
[38:55] morning
[38:56] zachariah had an atmosphere of doubt
[38:59] when it had been proven
[39:01] when it had been proven what god could
[39:03] do
[39:04] but mary had an atmosphere of faith in
[39:06] believing in something that would that
[39:09] never happened before
[39:12] it was impossible
[39:15] but
[39:16] notice they both asked the same exact
[39:20] question
[39:22] how can this thing be
[39:26] but the atmosphere
[39:28] see god knew who to come to
[39:32] he knew how to prove his word there was
[39:35] many virgins
[39:36] many virgins that he could have came to
[39:38] but you know that god always before they
[39:41] were ever before god ever moves on
[39:43] something he already knows the
[39:45] pre-context
[39:47] of the situation
[39:50] he knew
[39:51] that he knew mary's heart
[39:54] he knew he also knew zechariah would
[39:56] doubt the word
[39:59] he also knew he would doubt the word
[40:02] that's why he came back with the same
[40:04] scenario just to give us an example
[40:08] that
[40:09] that example is you can sit in the same
[40:11] church hear the same word
[40:14] and come out with two different outcomes
[40:20] but brother branham said here this
[40:21] little woman had to believe something
[40:23] that had never happened
[40:25] she probably searched the scriptures
[40:28] just to see
[40:30] is it possible
[40:32] but it was she wasn't searching with a
[40:34] doubt in her heart
[40:36] she believed the word even though she
[40:39] had no proof
[40:41] the scripture says
[40:47] faith
[40:50] you believing in something you cannot
[40:53] see
[40:54] she had no proof that it happened but
[40:57] yet she believed and it fulfilled god's
[41:00] word had to be proven at that moment
[41:03] because her faith began to believe in
[41:05] the supernatural
[41:08] that atmosphere was created
[41:13] the atmosphere was created in order for
[41:16] god to move
[41:17] this morning this day let's create an
[41:21] atmosphere for god to move this morning
[41:24] [Applause]
[41:29] the scripture says you speak to the
[41:31] mountain
[41:36] lord help me what did god tell him you
[41:38] got the power this gift i've given to
[41:41] you
[41:42] you got to operate it
[41:48] we've gotten too
[41:49] too weak
[41:51] we've gotten too
[41:53] i don't know what's going to relax
[41:57] we've gotten too relaxed with the word
[41:59] and lackadaisical
[42:01] and we
[42:04] the scripture says faith without works
[42:05] is dead
[42:07] god got to do everything for us now
[42:11] we can't believe him for a headache we
[42:13] can't believe him for nothing no more
[42:17] i don't know about y'all
[42:19] god has proven his word to me time and
[42:21] time and time and time and time again
[42:27] so i don't need nobody to preach me up
[42:30] i don't need nobody to try to sang me up
[42:33] his word has already been proven to me
[42:36] it's been quickened in my heart
[42:39] the word my word have i quickened in you
[42:43] that you would manifest this oh my god
[42:49] the problem is
[42:53] we can't believe
[42:56] because
[42:57] to us
[42:58] this is a god of history
[43:03] it's a god of history to us
[43:07] it can't happen no more
[43:10] we hear stories they're good stories
[43:14] good stories good to tell
[43:17] good to go along with your sermon
[43:21] but
[43:22] the faith
[43:24] that was once delivered to the saints is
[43:26] rare now
[43:29] that faith and that believing in the
[43:31] word
[43:32] even though they couldn't see it
[43:35] it's not here no more
[43:37] it's rare
[43:40] it's rare
[43:41] i don't know
[43:42] i don't know what's wrong
[43:45] brother branham said that we would
[43:46] manifest these things at the end time
[43:51] we we listen to the very same tapes
[43:55] but it's just tapes
[43:58] you are the word
[44:01] you are the word the bible says in the
[44:03] beginning was the word the word was with
[44:05] god and the word was god and the word
[44:07] became flesh and dwelt among us
[44:12] but remember jesus said remember that i
[44:15] am in the father the father in me
[44:18] i in you
[44:21] and whatever you ask in my name
[44:24] that will i do
[44:31] that will he do
[44:33] in the
[44:34] midst we listened to all the stories of
[44:37] the bible listen to what happened in
[44:39] brother branham's ministry
[44:42] what about now
[44:45] what about now
[44:48] raising from the dead
[44:50] sick being healed
[44:53] y'all looking at a modern day lazarus
[44:58] i was dead but now i live
[45:02] 2019. in the operating room for a simple
[45:05] procedure
[45:08] dead
[45:12] i don't know how long i was gone
[45:14] but i was dead
[45:16] went in on a tuesday morning brother
[45:18] wait i ain't wake up until friday
[45:20] afternoon
[45:25] dead
[45:27] but god raised me from the dead
[45:31] many testimonies i got a friend
[45:34] that i hadn't seen in a long time but
[45:36] his heart just completely gave out dead
[45:39] for 30 minutes
[45:41] i don't know if we got any nurses or
[45:43] doctors in here but the brain cannot
[45:45] take cannot
[45:47] go without oxygen for a certain amount
[45:49] of time correct
[45:51] how long is that
[45:53] ten minutes
[45:55] eight minutes
[45:57] the brain cannot go without oxygen for
[46:00] eight minutes
[46:02] he was dead for 30 minutes
[46:05] 30
[46:08] made it to the hospital
[46:10] brought back no brain damage
[46:15] he was there to tell the testimony of
[46:17] what god did for him
[46:19] that can happen right now
[46:23] we're not serving the god of history the
[46:26] same works god will do today
[46:30] he will and can't perform it but you got
[46:33] to move into position and know who you
[46:36] are this morning
[46:39] [Music]
[46:41] the problem is we don't know who we are
[46:44] it's father's day our heavenly father
[46:47] the scripture said now we are the sons
[46:49] of god we are the sons and daughters of
[46:51] god at this morning
[46:53] [Applause]
[46:59] that word lives on the inside of you so
[47:01] whatever you say
[47:04] whatever you speak
[47:06] it has to move
[47:08] it has to operate
[47:16] psalms 82 says
[47:18] and i have told you
[47:21] ye are
[47:23] gods
[47:25] and then jesus reminded us
[47:28] he said does not the law say ye are gods
[47:38] the scriptures told you who you are
[47:42] but where's the manifestation of who you
[47:44] are
[47:46] huh
[47:48] where's the speaking
[47:50] speaking the world and living on it
[47:55] where is that at
[47:57] where is the
[47:59] where is the changing of an atmosphere
[48:01] just when you walk in the room
[48:05] where's that
[48:06] [Music]
[48:08] the atmosphere
[48:10] if you want god to do something for you
[48:12] you create an atmosphere for him to move
[48:21] but
[48:22] it ain't about how much you read the
[48:23] message
[48:25] it ain't about how much you read about
[48:26] it ain't even about how much you pray
[48:30] you know what it's about
[48:32] it's your belief it's your faith
[48:35] we look at these stories and brother
[48:36] branham
[48:38] he had the gift of divine healing but if
[48:41] y'all read the message anybody read it
[48:45] what would brother branham say do you
[48:48] believe
[48:50] do you have faith
[48:53] that's what he would ask him
[48:55] so god moved based off of the faith
[49:00] he proved himself off of your faith
[49:04] it wasn't about the prophet
[49:07] it was more so him trying to increase
[49:10] your faith
[49:14] if no faith is present
[49:17] god can still move and i'ma tell you
[49:19] later on he can still move
[49:24] but
[49:25] these supernatural things that we're
[49:27] that we come to church to be an
[49:30] expectation of
[49:32] it's not about
[49:33] who behind the pulpit preaching
[49:36] or who behind the pulpit singing
[49:40] it's about the atmosphere you bring
[49:45] it's about the liquor fire you bring
[49:48] it
[49:52] many times in the scripture let's take
[49:55] the children of israel because
[49:57] because i love using them
[49:59] the children of israel
[50:01] god had done many things for them
[50:04] time and time and time and time and time
[50:06] and time and time and time again
[50:10] every time he did something they still
[50:12] had doubt in their heart
[50:15] at the red sea
[50:17] doubt in their heart
[50:19] when god had performed many
[50:22] many works in egypt
[50:26] still doubting their heart
[50:28] the pill of fire
[50:30] doubt in their heart
[50:32] open up the red sea doubt in their heart
[50:36] god still moving in the midst of doubt
[50:42] doubt don't stop god from moving
[50:45] you think because
[50:46] you think because you think you know
[50:49] more
[50:50] and it's it's oh well that ain't that's
[50:52] not logical
[50:54] god ain't logical at all
[50:58] ain't logical at all
[51:03] it ain't logical for that to happen
[51:06] if you if you read your bible
[51:10] there's many unlogical things i don't
[51:12] even know if that's a word unlogical
[51:14] things
[51:16] that happen
[51:18] a man ripped the jaws of a lion
[51:22] a little boy killed a bear and a lion
[51:26] a little boy slayed a giant
[51:29] who hands was bigger than him
[51:34] i don't know who used that example but
[51:36] he
[51:37] had 14 inch fingers he'll slap you and
[51:40] then come around the other side and
[51:46] unlogical
[51:50] but in the midst of that unlogical
[51:53] happening
[51:55] god moved
[51:58] even though the prophet hit god's
[52:00] prophet doubted the word
[52:03] god still moved
[52:06] just to
[52:07] just to shake the faith of the believer
[52:14] children of israel had known what god
[52:17] had done for him
[52:19] knew what god would do for them
[52:22] but still with doubt in the heart he
[52:25] still operated in his attributes
[52:32] they get down let's get let's take david
[52:35] and i preached this last sunday good
[52:37] lord just gave it to me
[52:40] take david
[52:42] david had conquered so many things god
[52:46] used him
[52:47] so many times
[52:50] and they're at zig lag
[52:53] and the enemy had completely overtaken
[52:56] took everything nobody died
[52:59] but they took everything
[53:02] and the scripture says
[53:04] that the people were sore
[53:07] they began to weep
[53:09] till they couldn't weep no more
[53:12] they begin to cry so they couldn't cry
[53:14] no more
[53:16] even david began to cry
[53:18] but then it says david encouraged
[53:21] himself
[53:22] in the lord
[53:25] he encouraged himself even though he
[53:28] lost
[53:29] two wives and children
[53:36] and in that atmosphere he asked
[53:39] lord
[53:41] shall i overtake and recover
[53:44] and the lord said surely you shall
[53:46] overtake and recover all
[53:49] he said you go back and reclaim what's
[53:52] yours and you ain't gonna lose nothing
[53:54] amen
[53:58] that scripture is to us
[54:00] whatever we've lost
[54:03] recover it and you won't lose it
[54:11] loved ones out in the world recovering
[54:14] them they're yours
[54:16] this morning they are yours
[54:20] let's make the word live this morning
[54:23] let's make the word live today
[54:30] so he went back and recovered all
[54:37] in the midst
[54:38] just to prove god to prove himself again
[54:42] and later on down the road he still had
[54:44] to prove himself to david again
[54:47] because david had to write
[54:50] i'll lift up mine eyes into the heels
[54:52] from which cometh my health
[54:56] when god
[54:57] when god had proven himself to david
[55:00] time and god used him to prove his word
[55:04] and he still doubted
[55:12] let's take john ryan

[55:19] wasn't divine healing faith
[55:22] he went to brother branham
[55:24] i can't see

[55:46] john ryan i can see
[55:48] i can see
[55:49] i can see

[55:54] and the atmosphere of doubt came at him
[55:59] you still can't see john
[56:02] you confessing what you confess and you
[56:04] can't see
[56:06] so he went back he that that doubt
[56:09] overtaking him
[56:10] and he went back
[56:13] brother branham
[56:15] i thought you said i could see
[56:17] i thought you said i was healed
[56:21] what did brother branham say
[56:24] what did he say
[56:25] i thought you believed
[56:30] spoken word do you believe this morning
[56:32] [Applause]
[56:36] he said i do i do believe
[56:39] he said well go confessing your healing
[56:45] so he went on again
[56:47] i can see
[56:48] i can see
[56:50] i can see
[56:51] i can see and he ended up going to a
[56:53] barbershop
[56:55] god took him to the lion's den
[57:02] where you had the doubting lions it
[57:04] wasn't courageous lions it was doubting
[57:06] lions
[57:09] i can see i can see i can see i can see
[57:13] i can see
[57:15] john you still saying you can see
[57:18] and you can't see yet
[57:20] you've been talking about this
[57:22] and you still ain't
[57:25] if god ain't done it for you yet he
[57:27] ain't gonna do it for you
[57:29] you might as well just stop you making a
[57:31] fool of yourself
[57:34] i can see i can see i can see all that
[57:37] doubt surrounding him he's still
[57:39] confessing the word that came to his
[57:41] door i can see i can see i can see i can
[57:45] see till his eyes popped up and he ran
[57:52] the word had to be proven in the midst
[57:54] of doubt
[57:55] [Applause]
[57:59] god don't just make his word happen he
[58:01] make the situation look like it ain't
[58:03] gonna happen
[58:04] then it happens
[58:11] i can see i can see in the midst of
[58:14] doubt
[58:15] good friends of john
[58:17] it can't happen
[58:19] it can't happen
[58:20] john you've been blind almost all your
[58:22] life
[58:25] you confessing this now you are old man
[58:28] what you need your vision for
[58:31] you too old
[58:33] like my old pastor say you got one foot
[58:35] in the grave and one foot on earth
[58:37] we're waiting on you to die
[58:43] in that atmosphere
[58:46] in the atmosphere zechariah created
[58:49] god shut his mouth
[58:52] a prophet he said i'ma shut your mouth
[58:55] until the word that i have spoken to you
[58:58] is fulfilled
[59:04] and if we look at that if we if we
[59:06] continue to look
[59:08] god created
[59:10] god made the situation
[59:12] worse
[59:15] elizabeth did get pregnant but john was
[59:18] dead
[59:20] hadn't moved in months
[59:24] but when the word came
[59:26] the word began to come
[59:30] and john met the word
[59:33] and the word was made flesh
[59:38] and the word came to elizabeth
[59:41] who's had an atmosphere
[59:43] of hurt and doubt
[59:45] because she did get pregnant
[59:47] but the baby had not moved
[59:52] imma take it a little deeper it didn't
[59:54] have a heartbeat
[59:57] he wasn't shouting yet
[1:00:04] another atmosphere
[1:00:08] elizabeth
[1:00:09] she knew
[1:00:11] that this was a child's truly sent from
[1:00:14] god
[1:00:18] and for the situation of
[1:00:20] the one child that i have
[1:00:24] that the lord finally bestowed upon me
[1:00:26] is dead
[1:00:29] that atmosphere surrounded her
[1:00:32] but the word came to her door
[1:00:34] and quickened
[1:00:36] quicken itself
[1:00:39] amen amen
[1:00:41] thy word have i quickened in you
[1:00:44] that same spirit that raised christ from
[1:00:46] the dead dwelling you it will quicken
[1:00:49] your mortal body
[1:00:54] the word was quicken in john
[1:00:57] he received the holy ghost
[1:01:00] right then and there
[1:01:06] let me tell y'all something
[1:01:10] those same things have happened in my
[1:01:14] life
[1:01:15] i got a friend right now
[1:01:17] say he was driving home
[1:01:19] late at night from wherever
[1:01:23] and he said he ran out of gas and he
[1:01:25] only got one car for his family
[1:01:28] ran out of gas
[1:01:31] and he just
[1:01:32] in the atmosphere
[1:01:35] something came to him
[1:01:37] and said jesus turned water into wine
[1:01:41] and something said you got two water
[1:01:43] jugs in the back of your car
[1:01:47] so he said
[1:01:48] he took those two water jugs
[1:01:52] and the words
[1:01:54] had to be proven at that moment
[1:01:59] and he said lord
[1:02:01] you turn water into wine
[1:02:03] now i need you to turn this water in the
[1:02:05] gas
[1:02:10] and he said he put it in his car
[1:02:14] and drove all the way home
[1:02:20] and his car's still working the way it's
[1:02:23] supposed to
[1:02:25] [Music]
[1:02:28] i took that testimony
[1:02:30] last monday
[1:02:32] brother wade yes
[1:02:34] i had some money in my pocket but i
[1:02:36] needed to cash it first and i had to go
[1:02:38] to work and and go to i go to work at
[1:02:41] six o'clock in the morning
[1:02:43] banks don't open till nine
[1:02:46] brother wade i'm i'm i'm halfway between
[1:02:50] a quarter of a tank and e
[1:02:54] something said
[1:02:56] you preached
[1:02:57] last night
[1:02:59] about creating an atmosphere for the
[1:03:01] supernatural
[1:03:03] prove it
[1:03:06] amen
[1:03:08] so i said lord
[1:03:10] if you gave joshua the power
[1:03:14] to make the sun stand still
[1:03:17] you give me the power and to speak to
[1:03:20] this needle and tell it not to move
[1:03:22] until i put gas in it
[1:03:28] brother wade i drove all the way i lived
[1:03:32] 30 miles from my house
[1:03:34] drove all the way to work
[1:03:37] i had to drive five exits to get to the
[1:03:40] bank
[1:03:42] drove all the way to work to the bank
[1:03:45] back to work still ain't put gas in it
[1:03:48] needle still didn't move

[1:04:02] the bank called me sir
[1:04:03] we shorted you on your stay
[1:04:07] drove all the way to the bank
[1:04:09] then finally
[1:04:11] drove to the gas station the needle was
[1:04:14] where i told it to stay
[1:04:15] [Applause]
[1:04:22] the atmosphere in believing the word
[1:04:27] let me tell you something the prophet
[1:04:28] said
[1:04:42] this is what he said
[1:04:48] he says what we need is the holy ghost
[1:04:51] it's a holy ghost
[1:04:53] an atmosphere where the power of god
[1:04:56] moving on one accord one place gathered
[1:05:00] together under the atmosphere of
[1:05:02] expecting god to do something
[1:05:08] god to move and do signs and wonders
[1:05:11] amen
[1:05:12] let's move ourselves
[1:05:15] into that bracket
[1:05:18] step up on faith
[1:05:20] move out of these three dimensions
[1:05:22] into the next one
[1:05:26] god called you to be supernatural
[1:05:29] [Music]
[1:05:31] but satan loves to bring an atmosphere
[1:05:34] in the midst of you because he knows if
[1:05:37] you just
[1:05:38] if you just get into position
[1:05:40] if you just get to know who you are
[1:05:44] he's already defeated
[1:05:48] if the bride can just recognize who she
[1:05:50] is
[1:05:52] if she can recognize the power in the
[1:05:54] host of angels that's surrounding her
[1:06:02] you are the pride of jesus christ
[1:06:05] an invincible army
[1:06:07] misses jesus
[1:06:11] you got a legions of angels surrounding
[1:06:13] you
[1:06:14] at your disposal
[1:06:18] your husband don't play about you
[1:06:22] your husband i'm sorry
[1:06:25] your husband
[1:06:28] will not let nothing happen to you i'm
[1:06:31] sorry for that slang saying y'all
[1:06:33] your husband don't play about you
[1:06:41] your husband got your back
[1:06:45] the same
[1:06:46] omnipotent power that god holds
[1:06:50] is at your disposal
[1:06:54] operating through the power of the holy
[1:06:56] ghost
[1:06:58] if god is with us where be his miracles
[1:07:02] you
[1:07:03] have the mind of christ
[1:07:06] if you are fulfilling scripture anybody
[1:07:09] fulfilling scripture this morning
[1:07:11] if you are fulfilling scripture and you
[1:07:13] are the word the word says let this mind
[1:07:16] be in you
[1:07:17] which was in christ jesus
[1:07:22] who thought it not robbery
[1:07:26] who thought it not robbery
[1:07:29] to be equal with god
[1:07:35] what's wrong with us today
[1:07:40] it's like the scripture saying
[1:07:43] we got a form of godliness
[1:07:46] but denying the power thereof
[1:07:49] there's power in the name of jesus
[1:07:53] and you carry that name so there's power
[1:07:57] in you
[1:08:02] if you believe in the supernatural
[1:08:05] you got the power
[1:08:08] you hold
[1:08:09] brother brandon said we have the title
[1:08:11] to our inheritance
[1:08:17] and if you believe the word
[1:08:20] i know my about i don't know about y'all
[1:08:22] bible you know y'all might hire y'all
[1:08:23] might have a new world version
[1:08:25] where they gender friendly and
[1:08:27] they don't want to hurt nobody feelings
[1:08:30] [Applause]
[1:08:31] i don't know about y'all
[1:08:33] but my bible says
[1:08:37] let me get dignified for this one
[1:08:40] [Applause]
[1:08:43] my bible says
[1:08:50] that
[1:08:58] my bible says
[1:09:01] that the word
[1:09:03] was made manifest
[1:09:08] so

[1:09:12] but i can speak
[1:09:15] to the mountain
[1:09:17] and tell it to be cast into the sea and
[1:09:20] it can happen
[1:09:21] [Music]
[1:09:23] i don't know about y'all
[1:09:29] i can speak to limbs
[1:09:32] and they'll grow back
[1:09:34] i can speak to the dead
[1:09:37] they'll be raised
[1:09:39] my bible says
[1:09:42] that he was wounded for my
[1:09:43] transgressions
[1:09:44] bruised for my iniquities and the
[1:09:47] chastisement of my peace was upon him
[1:09:51] and by his stripes
[1:09:54] i was healed
[1:09:56] ain't no ears
[1:09:58] ain't no aim
[1:10:00] was you know what that means
[1:10:03] it's already done
[1:10:06] [Music]
[1:10:07] [Applause]
[1:10:12] i don't have to wait for it no more it's
[1:10:14] right now
[1:10:16] it's manifested in me

[1:10:26] need of it's right now

[1:12:04] satan just don't want you to get into
[1:12:06] position
[1:12:09] because when you do
[1:12:12] he knows he can't do nothing with you
[1:12:16] he that's why he tried to make you doubt
[1:12:18] whether you
[1:12:19] i don't know why you come i beat it i

[1:12:43] and you call yourself a son of god
[1:12:47] he loves to whisper in your ear cause he
[1:12:50] knows he can't holler at you
[1:12:54] he know he can't yell at you
[1:12:57] so he'll come and whisper in your ear
[1:13:00] now you know what you was doing last
[1:13:01] night you shouldn't have been doing that
[1:13:06] you know what you was doing last night
[1:13:08] now you remember what how you remember
[1:13:10] how you used to be
[1:13:13] you remember what you used to be
[1:13:15] and you thank god love you
[1:13:21] you thank god love you
[1:13:25] you was a sinner
[1:13:28] god called you a sinner that's what he
[1:13:30] called you
[1:13:32] said you came into the world speaking
[1:13:34] lies
[1:13:36] and you think that god loves you
[1:13:43] you think that god love you
[1:13:46] when he do that
[1:13:49] he know
[1:13:51] that you got the power to destroy him at
[1:13:54] that moment
[1:13:56] but he makes you doubt what you have
[1:14:01] because he's already been defeated
[1:14:04] god already defeated him
[1:14:07] but he if he can get you to take your
[1:14:10] eyes
[1:14:11] off of what's on the inside of you
[1:14:14] he got you
[1:14:19] he knows god don't play about you
[1:14:22] that's why he don't come to him about
[1:14:23] you
[1:14:27] he knows how much confidence god has in
[1:14:30] you
[1:14:31] because if he didn't he would have never
[1:14:32] went to god about job
[1:14:37] god remember when you go through trials
[1:14:40] god has confidence in who you are
[1:14:44] he has confidence in the life that he's
[1:14:47] put on the inside of you
[1:14:55] he has confidence in you
[1:14:57] as a believer
[1:14:59] there's nothing impossible
[1:15:02] for you
[1:15:03] [Music]
[1:15:04] do y'all we read the same bible right
[1:15:07] doesn't the scripture say with god
[1:15:10] all things are possible
[1:15:13] and it also says that there's nothing
[1:15:15] impossible
[1:15:17] for god
[1:15:19] and then he told me
[1:15:22] that he lived on the inside of me
[1:15:26] so that means there's nothing
[1:15:28] impossible
[1:15:30] for me
[1:15:33] there's nothing impossible for you
[1:15:36] so you can speak a world and live on it
[1:15:39] amen
[1:15:41] you can speak to a sickness and it'll
[1:15:43] leave
[1:15:45] you can speak to demons and they will
[1:15:48] leave
[1:15:51] you can speak in whatever you speak you
[1:15:54] have
[1:15:55] [Music]
[1:15:58] god you put that power in my hands i
[1:16:00] don't know what to ask for
[1:16:04] god knew not to come and tell me ask
[1:16:06] what you will
[1:16:09] i said give me three billion right nine
[1:16:13] and give me ten later
[1:16:15] that'll be me
[1:16:17] but god knew the hearts
[1:16:20] of everybody
[1:16:22] we say we want that had it right
[1:16:24] experience
[1:16:26] oh it's just god didn't devastate it
[1:16:28] right if he would have did that for me
[1:16:30] he ain't gonna do it for you
[1:16:34] thank you sister not with that
[1:16:35] atmosphere
[1:16:37] not with the character that you have
[1:16:40] he knew
[1:16:42] he knew to do that for her
[1:16:44] because he knew her desire he knew her
[1:16:47] heart
[1:16:48] he already knew what she would ask for
[1:16:53] so when it came
[1:16:55] and the word came to her door
[1:16:57] and it wasn't a deep word
[1:17:01] the word ain't got to be deep for you to
[1:17:02] believe
[1:17:06] it ain't got to be the seals laid out
[1:17:08] before you
[1:17:10] the seventh thunders
[1:17:12] do you hear his voice it ain't got to be
[1:17:14] all that
[1:17:17] the word that came to her door
[1:17:20] was a story about squirrels
[1:17:24] can somebody say squirrels
[1:17:28] squirrels
[1:17:33] that simple word
[1:17:36] and she said ain't nothing but the truth
[1:17:41] that word brought the atmosphere of
[1:17:44] asking whatever you will
[1:17:50] brother brandon said something came up
[1:17:52] and said
[1:17:53] ask what you will
[1:17:57] whatever you want if you want a million
[1:17:59] dollars
[1:18:00] right now
[1:18:02] that's what i would ask for
[1:18:04] but god knew her heart
[1:18:08] he knew he works on both ends of the
[1:18:10] spectrum
[1:18:13] i read a quote with brother branham said
[1:18:17] yo you can't even believe without first
[1:18:20] god allowing it
[1:18:22] without first him working your faith
[1:18:26] you can't even believe without god
[1:18:28] working your faith
[1:18:32] she believed that little story
[1:18:35] in the presence of god came down
[1:18:38] ask what you will
[1:18:41] this morning i'ma say ask what you will
[1:18:44] ask what you will
[1:18:46] this morning

[1:27:35] clapping praise again god bless you
[1:27:37] brother good job
[1:27:42] you sound kind of like a veteran
[1:27:51] god can do a lot
[1:27:54] in a very quick period of time
[1:27:56] and that's what we need we need young
[1:27:57] people
[1:27:58] they can go down that aisle about 25
[1:28:00] times
[1:28:03] and still be able to go down that aisle
[1:28:05] 25 more times
[1:28:08] but thank god because it's an
[1:28:09] inspiration it's it's i was thinking the
[1:28:11] other day it is it's a supernatural
[1:28:13] thing that brother brown talks about the
[1:28:14] supernatural element of a mystery well
[1:28:16] we're the mystery amen so we have a
[1:28:19] supernatural element that the world
[1:28:20] can't they can't if you if we were all
[1:28:22] to get together and start talking about
[1:28:24] the word of god
[1:28:25] in this hour that we know
[1:28:28] and a stranger walks up
[1:28:31] what are you talking about
[1:28:33] why because you're in another atmosphere
[1:28:36] now if that guy in fact whoever that is
[1:28:38] if they go what was that again
[1:28:40] what you talking about this would you
[1:28:42] get that out yeah well then you're good
[1:28:44] but now they some people go whoa
[1:28:47] i don't want any of that
[1:28:49] well it's not for them not for everybody
[1:28:52] but that's okay it's for us
[1:28:54] it's for us just claimed it
[1:28:56] it's precious to us we don't everyone
[1:28:58] get rid of it we want to stun around we
[1:29:00] want to talk about it we want to we want
[1:29:02] to praise his name and that's what we
[1:29:04] come to do today and our brother he oh i
[1:29:06] believe that faith
[1:29:08] and he don't know it but i was talking
[1:29:10] to brother bob and we've been talking on
[1:29:12] faith but we're going to do some more on
[1:29:13] faith because i believe faith brother
[1:29:15] brown said faith is the key
[1:29:18] right faith is the key to unlock the
[1:29:19] door we got some doors that need to be
[1:29:21] unlocked
[1:29:22] so we need to have the key and that down
[1:29:24] at the bottom of the pyramid that's a
[1:29:25] big wive down there it says faith
[1:29:27] so we need to have faith faith for the
[1:29:29] time the prophet of god said i think we
[1:29:31] need faith for the time john wesley
[1:29:32] didn't need faith we get we then
[1:29:36] martin luther didn't need the faith we
[1:29:37] did they weren't they weren't having
[1:29:38] faith for a rapture that's right you and
[1:29:40] i are gonna have to have faith for a
[1:29:42] rapture
[1:29:43] we're gonna have to have faith for a
[1:29:44] body change we're gonna have to have
[1:29:45] faith for a resurrection faith and then
[1:29:48] brother branham now let me tell you
[1:29:50] something real quick brother brown said
[1:29:51] jesus walked in the world of perfect
[1:29:52] faith right yes
[1:29:54] read his life
[1:29:57] he said oh if i had perfect faith the
[1:29:59] bills would quit coming
[1:30:01] the car would stay full of gas
[1:30:04] i wouldn't have no worries at all
[1:30:05] brother branham said jesus walked in a
[1:30:07] world of perfect faith and look what
[1:30:10] happened to him for three and a half
[1:30:11] years
[1:30:12] they hated him they wanted to stone him
[1:30:15] they wanted to throw him off a cliff
[1:30:17] they called him a devil
[1:30:19] he probably was cast out of many
[1:30:21] different places he cried
[1:30:23] he wept over jerusalem
[1:30:26] it wasn't a fine party that he was in
[1:30:28] but brother brown said he walked in the
[1:30:30] world
[1:30:31] so i think that's what we're we're we're
[1:30:33] trying to get that perfect faith to
[1:30:35] where nothing
[1:30:36] you know nothing's going to harm us and
[1:30:38] we have no
[1:30:39] no
[1:30:41] jesus hung on a cross with perfect faith
[1:30:45] with nail holes in his hand and looked
[1:30:47] like a piece of hamburger meat but
[1:30:48] brother brown said he walked in the
[1:30:49] world of perfect faith
[1:30:51] what you know what he did he knew who he
[1:30:52] was as you were saying today we got to
[1:30:54] know who we are
[1:30:56] and stay focused on that who we are we
[1:30:59] are the son of man we are the word made
[1:31:01] flesh i've been reading that scripture
[1:31:02] well read it at y'all's church
[1:31:04] that we have made the word made flesh
[1:31:07] and the perfect faith then can be in us
[1:31:10] not that our bills are going to get paid
[1:31:11] not that all these things
[1:31:13] no
[1:31:14] but you know what you know who you are
[1:31:16] when you get up in the morning you know
[1:31:17] who you are when you go to bed you know
[1:31:18] who you are even when you go through a
[1:31:20] trial there you go you know who you are
[1:31:22] and you don't lose that
[1:31:24] i don't i don't have bad days and i'm
[1:31:26] not a dale
[1:31:27] i don't have good days and i'm and i'm
[1:31:29] not a dad no i'm a dad all the time
[1:31:30] because i was born in the family so
[1:31:32] you're a christian you're born into the
[1:31:33] family of god you're going to have
[1:31:34] trials and tribulation
[1:31:36] but you know what you're going to make
[1:31:37] it through
[1:31:38] we read the book
[1:31:40] the book says we win
[1:31:41] and i keep reading that book and i keep
[1:31:43] reading that book it's kind of like the
[1:31:45] tortoise and the hair
[1:31:47] right who wins the race
[1:31:49] the turtle always wins read the book 20
[1:31:52] times or 100 times turtle always wins
[1:31:56] so the bride's always going to win
