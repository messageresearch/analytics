even in you to the end of the world so we thank God for his grace this morning I don't say I appreciate uh Thomas Smith and Brother Sam brother and better Wade and Brother Don and different ones and a little Mart right here and we had a good time and then we didn't kill nothing but it still was rewarding everybody I didn't know Richard worked in a sawmill until I slept with him in there Brazil and I I told my God I thought brother away when I woke up that morning and I thought I wonder I'm not gonna be able to get out of the room lost gonna be all in front of my door so that was the most exciting thing about the trip we had a real good time and I appreciate everything I I just appreciate uh your friendship and and coming down here and share the word Lord with you at this church here and by God grace I just thank the Lord this morning I like that little song uh I'll be right there somewhere listening from my name that was that was kind of where I was going this morning so that was the right song to be saying I'll be somewhere listening for my name and that's what we all are looking for to hear our name called uh this morning I'm going to go right to the word of God I'm gonna be reading from the book of Saint Matthew the seventh chapter 21 down to 23 in Revelation the sixth chapter and the verse 8. praise God this the book of Saint Matthew the seventh chapter and the 21 verse praise God I'm gonna use that a little bit too because that thing got some big lettuce I'm going to try to read it right here but when I really just thought I might have to use that up there amen so it says not everyone that says unto me Lord Lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven but he that does the will of My Father which is in heaven for many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have not we prophesied in thy name and in thy name cast out devils and then thy name done many wonderful words and then will I profess unto them I never knew you'd depart from me either working iniquity and revelation 6. Revelation 6 and I want to read verse 8. and they said and I look and behold a Pale Horse and his name that said on him was called Death and Hell Followed With Him and powers given unto him over the forefoot of the of the earth to kill with the sword and with hunger and with death and with the Beast of the earth as prayer father God help me one more time to you my body my mind my spirit my soul God Lord help me to get myself out of the way God now father God take over the service God in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you this morning you may be seated thank the Lord for the reading of the word of God this morning I took from the scripture this morning by God grace I'm going to try to save a little bit of energy for this evening so you know about God grace so if I don't I got a backup plan yeah I got a backup plan Maybe amen so thank the Lord so what do you want to say about God great I looked at the scripture this morning and it says right here not everyone that says unto me Lord Lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven but he that does the will of My Father which is in heaven Hallelujah another word it is said well many will come to me that day and then where they using the name of the Lord and they're casting out devils and they heal in the sick and they prophesy and Jesus is saying I never knew you right and his name that said to him was called Death how do you know the words United took was titled this either this morning falling from the position of power and uh yeah I began to realize and I was thinking when I started studying this message falling from the position of power and I began to think because everybody want Power everybody wanna a a position or a a some type of authority to feel like I'm in control how did so we begin to live but I'm talking about falling from the position of power and I looked in here and I began to study this out here a bit because he said your many will come to me in that day using the name of the Lord people you do not have to have the Holy Ghost to get the name of the Lord to work if you any demon any drug or any prostitute could use the name of Jesus and somebody could have faith and a miracle take place how do you showed that that was a day we got the world full of people that could use his name without living his life Hallelujah we begin to realize here so you know you say well they know the anointing there I knew there was something to play that was anointed when the Beatles played right how did Peter thousands of people got healed when the Beatles was playing but that was not done in the name of the Lord that was not done in the light that he had it was under the inspiration and people come out of the wheelchairs honey so we just don't want to it's not depend on that we want to know here Jesus said he that does the will of My Father which is in heaven how does it shall begin to relax but we want to talk about falling from the power of position as I look at this what was the first fall from Power with position yeah the first time did it ever been recorded or something falling that had power and I began to set it and I began to think and then when I looked in the word of God the first being I seen that had power and position Hallelujah and had had a had a at a position in heaven and that was luciferable so the first fall is started in heaven and started with a B called Lucifer and what gave him his position was his name right I want you to notice here that Lucifer name had Authority behind it had name right there had positioned and would lose the boy was in heaven he was a name looking but he walked under the among the codes of fire he shied the Revelation he was over the choir he was the oldest he had a power position so when he and I want you to notice this have you ever thought about this when losing will fail from Heaven his name means uh his name means a bright uh Morning Star has also has named me a bright light so he in other words so he's fallen if you notice when he fell from heaven Hallelujah he was falling and he let any as he and he began to try to force the another will in heaven instead of the will of God I'll just I want you to know that when he fell from heaven what did God do if you notice in the scripture where losable fail God took his name from him Hallelujah when he failed God no longer called him Lucifer anyway if you know him his name would change and when he entered into the garden God changed his body all right Hey listen we begin to look here we find her he lost his position now I want you to know sure but I once started this war well with the war it was the power wheel it was the power wheel right if you notice there it was the power of the wheels Elizabeth wanted his will over the will of God so if I begin if I looked in the scripture and I would read from the book of Isaiah 14 we're going to see this battle start he wanted to change the will of God to his will Isaiah 14 I'm gonna read a few verses here he telling Lucy he's speaking here there's a battle going on and he's telling him he's a hard up falling Isaiah the 14th chapter verse 12 he said how'd I'm falling from heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how to cut down to the ground what did weak in the nation for thou has said in the heart of what I will I want you to notice here he was it was a power a will I will either I will Ascend into heaven I will I will set up on the mountain of the congregation in the size of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the god I will be like the most high he is forcing a will in heaven the anointing said here yea thy shall be brought down to Hell to the size of the pit honey and then what he's losing the power position he been stripped down how did his name have been took away from him and I'm going to give you another name I'm gonna give him a name he gave him a name that he could never in any circumstance ever be saved again Hallelujah we begin to realize you and I want you to notice this if you never noticed this before have you ever noticed that the Book of Revelation talk about name he started with he it was constantly he was dealing with names Hollywood because in other words now we realize here that God we realize this is how this is the day that we're living in that the word of God must call you Hallelujah number call you by name you must see yourself in the scripture now and it shall begin to look here if you notice you're like think about like Revelation like Revelation 2 and verse 17 he's I'll give you a new name how did Revelation 17 in other words of Revelation 13. he had we find out that they had a name of black female Hallelujah Revelation 17 and verse 5 he's not called your name Shall be Called mystery Bible the great everything was identified by name I want you to notice this here Jesus began to deal with his church by name if you notice here it's Satan say Luke say Luke 10 verse 20 he says he said now we're standing he's a Rejoice not because the spirits accepted unto you he never rejoice because your name is written in heaven Hallelujah your name is written in heaven honey don't you rejoice because you see Power don't you rejoice because you see Devil's leave but Rejoice because your name is written in heaven but the problem was at that time they didn't know it right right it was a revelation Hallelujah if you ever find yourself here you my let bro self say here this message is my Revelation you cannot read your way into the Kingdom of Heaven you cannot study your way into the kingdom you must be called by the revolution of the word must call you by name and catch you and you catch a revelation with his Lord not because they have power uh Spirits which everybody would want to see this kind of move of God but here he is Jesus tells me here he was here he's a moral Rejoice because your name is written in heaven a name that cannot be removed under any circumstance how do God got a bride in the back of his mind and the devil cannot take her I cannot take her from the mind of God I don't care what the devil try to do God have called you before you even know who you are how did Jacob I have loved amen happy boy any boy had done any good evil I knew God could look in the back part of his mind I like Brother Sam said he can look through foreign so you remember him I'm just wondering if you notice your when brother Brady Pizza seals it was a name he began to deal with if you notice here I like the way it was in the in the book about Saint John 10 it was said to him the the poor to open the door and the sheep hear his voice so now he's here he's not only opened the door but he's calling his sheep Hallelujah in other words and and he uh called his own Sheep by name and lead them out I'll destroy realize here he not only called you but he called his sheep and I call him by name and I'm leading them out of here I got a bride here I'm not gonna let the world get her I'm gonna call her her Revelation is going to hear my voice Brandon goes here and he uses a quote in the in the first seal I'm using I'm reading from the wholesale book how did it so the numbers will be a little different and they wrote it over but the old Shield book he says in 122. he said the members of his bride their name was put in the Lamb's Book of life before the foundation of the world it has been sealed up now you've been revealed whose name was in there all about it so he said they was already enough God put it in the loud Book of Life how do before the foundation of the world and if God said I'm going to have a people they will overcome the Antichrist Spirit how do they will overcome the power of this system right and then he says and he stays back there and I dropped on down and John's hears everything in heaven every day underneath has said amen and blessed and honored anyone he the judge saw his name Hallelujah did he go down here now he must stay back there he must stay on his intercession Paul until that last Soul come in and he have called it by name Hallelujah I don't know where it may be and it might be somebody that need the Holy Ghost this morning might either last Soul come in and then he'd call you by name you will recognize this message and he says here same but man the same silver page 126. and he says here definitely as long as that was one name has never yet been declared in Earth Christ had the stator and intercession to make in to take care of that name as soon as that final name has been sliced into the Clorox or Bleach then his intercession day were over in other words as soon as that person recognized this message I didn't recognize that calling God I didn't interception there for that individual is over and his name had been declared in heaven we're talking about a revelation now we're talking about it so we talk about here we talk about it uh falling from the power position now I want you to know here we preach all the time I know there's a lot of them you know and especially in the message we deal with thoughts on you know he's calling my name yeah all the seven still call your name Hollywood does but the point of it is we must know what he called our name right how did y'all begin to realize here I mean I want you to notice here I read like Isaiah so I want you to know that's the name that was given unto Satan when Lutherville fell he changed his name and brought him down according to a revelation a revelation 12 verse 7 through uh 12 verse 7 due to 12th chapter verse 7 through verse 12 he said he said that was the war in heaven and his angels fought against the dragon and and the dragon fault and his angels and Prevail not neither would that place found any more in hell what did something that took place and it's not playing so that was a power in heaven have an anointed in heaven called Lucifer and the Bible said he was created perfect until that means a time that means it will be a path that he would show his color because God could not give him eternal life and if God would have gave the devil eternal life then God couldn't have never Discord him right but Lucifer was created perfect yeah until now something was in him right right something was found in him until what was found himself will have self-esteem he wanted to be more than God how did he would create a perfect until he wanted to be worship like God he wanted to be looked up as God and then sir would you came to mystery of a dignity was found in here how did he would create prayer in other words so now here he is dealing with him he said there was no faith found in heaven right anymore and the dragon was cast out now what you didn't notice here the dragon the dragon was cast out that old serpent right called the devil and Satan and say to which deceived the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his Angel would cast out with him and I heard a voice saying in heaven now is conservation is great end up king of our God and the power of His of his Christ for the accused of my brother is cast down and killed them before God night and day Hallelujah and they overcame and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of the of the testimony and they love and assure you if you notice you're like Brother Sam said if you know it he was because he was cast down and he came up the serpent he came down to the devil but you know that that mystery was they didn't never say Beast right exactly that was a mystery right there now God damn what he said there was a mystery laying there how did all this was spiritual forms he moved he was moving her but he had to Incarnate himself how do you had to become a beast how he could not interject himself into the human race in a spirit form but when he became a beast come on didn't God change his body you know the bees got the first body chain how do you change them from an upright creature to a serpent until he crawled on those ground like a snake how do you show you another word so we begin to realize here so we fighting him falling he had a name and he had a name that he could he had a name of death was in him and I want you to let you know today that what God is trying to show God he didn't if you own the Lamb of the life how do you will find your name in the word how did God you must find your name in the scripture I looked at this here and he said brother Joy I'm talking about names for a second how do you the power is your name hardly the power is behind you Hallelujah you know the word Shall We Begin to look at I want you to notice just real quick as we begin to go in other words Shall We Begin to look I'm talking about calling your name and then we're looking for a fail he moved from his position and the Bible says anyway he he said you are falling from Heaven and the word Greek means uh falling means they forsaken or being removed Hallelujah you all been falling from Heaven and the way you have been you have forsaken Lucifer and you have been removed amen hallelujah in other words so something type play I'm gonna tie this scripture with today we're here he would say whether people start falling from how did where do they fall today how do they have to have some plan in the scripture they fall from I want you to tell me you said when I've been in message a long time but some people have been around for Europe and they have been falling at least something took place he said father I want you to look at them two words falling Forsaken and been removed it got to be scripture that tied to that right because remember brother I said everything he does it always has scripture to tied to it because he preached the Bible he said when the sins was open the Bible became a new book Hallelujah if you can't find yourself in the scripture Hallelujah and the way you cannot find yourself in the Bible how there's something is wrong with your Revelation he said if you read the Bible and do not see Jesus Christ from Jesus the Revelation he said read it over because you have missed your name right I knew that would have happened let's take a look so let me get into looking I'm gonna stop there for a minute and begin to look at just Forsaken and falling Forsaken and removed a name that's been removed a name that's been Fallen Elizabeth has fallen Hallelujah been finally got when he fell from Christ God removed his name Hallelujah you say brother let us look at it and let us look at this look of a scripture to fit that right there and then I did I found it in Hebrews and look at Hebrews 10. Hebrews 10 and let us look at the word forsaken and removed so now I want you to notice here Hebrews 10 Hebrews 10 and they begin to read in verse 25. Hebrews 10 verse 25 it says these were not for what not forsaken Hallelujah in other words because now he's in a way you would have found your position in the word not forsaken to the symbolize self together as a matter of some some who if that name would have been in the book they would have been in The Fellowship of the word you could not make the Rapture without a preacher right honey because God got to have skin on him now Hallelujah I know where we got we got a lot of mechanical advices but that still is not God provided way how did that if you ain't got nothing but a tape recorder and that's all you could use God order that but if you've got a man of God that preaching the word of God and they're trying to get you ready for Rapture you need to be here and be cool I'm a fresh an ordinary sir here's another sickness as a matter of son but exalting one another so much and more as we see today approaching for if we should sin willfully if you know that he takes the type of Luther and he said what happened in the day of Wesley and Luther he said uh in the lutherans refused to go on and become father impregnated with the word of God and God moved himself and left the Luther name when you come here you refuse and you refuse to come to the word I refuse to come and be washed under the word of the hour because we all get spirits on us yeah but some people leave and they never get rid of the spirit amen we get sweaty we have to take a bath that's just the bottom line and if you don't think about the people's in church gonna be talking about you ain't nobody gonna be one to hug you I mean that's just the way it is and you know they know where they won't have nothing personally against you but smell yeah refusing to come in under the atmosphere of a god-sent man and be washed into words something is wrong the knowledge of the truth that remain no more sacrifice for sin he said God give the knowledge is a prophet and when we got God knowledge so we refuse the ministry catches the same mind that was in the prophet and he takes that word he said no he ministers we're breaking down like the other night here Brad said a lot of things Sam goes back take those nuggets he brought under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and begin to break down service so you can see your position how do God anyways preacher yeah my brother man left a job for the bride to do we're a man with the Holy Ghost had been sent to get a bride already he got the ability to go in the word of God and break it down Hallelujah sir brother he got ability to break the word down not just a man that would just say it a man just got it it is God is fine I'm gonna go out and do it but Amanda got a call good gift and we'll come up under the same anointed on the prophetic insight and we'll be able to break the message Hallelujah it was the same women that receive the knowledge of the truth that remaining no more sacrifice for sin somebody can be removed so he goes on here and says him but hey certain field for looking of the judgment and of our Indian Nation we shall divide the adversary he that despises Moses now he's putting the word behind the skin of the prophet he that despise his Moses out he told all this now go there and let you know it was under the influence of a prophet that their name is going to be removed how did he that despises Moses uh Moses low died without Mercy death under two or three Witnesses so we gotta realize him so now we come into the conclusion how to work God name is how they said we begin to realize here so I want to uh maybe drop back for a few minutes the Bible teaches us here and brother man tell us he said the seventh seal called our name how do you call your name I believe you recognize your position in the word right do you recognize that I'm a part of God and once you recognize where you come from you know where you're going all right I mean if you come from God you must go back to God I need so once you recognize you come from God and it gives you a peace of mind I'm going back to God but the problem made today people just up and down on this Merry-Go-Round back trying to find out who they are right right and just take it here I'm gonna deal with a few minutes I'm calling your name for just a few minutes How will I know and recognize my name is in heaven because your name cannot be removed right you ever thought about that your name cannot be removed and you but you got to recognize how do who I am Hallelujah and how you gonna recognize who you because you're gonna recognize in your heart that's a desire for God I don't care what it takes I got a design for God how did I might be I might not be what I want to be but I know one thing I'm not whatever used to be and God's still working on me Hallelujah but the point of a deal we must find here on God call your name I'm gonna look in the scripture and see can we find that real quick I looked in the scripture here let us go to Saint John 6. Saint John 6. sixth chapter of Saint John let me find that real quick and I'm not going to read all this I'm gonna deal with I'm gonna deal with uh this group that's coming out we didn't go in so a group to come out but didn't go in so Redemption two-part come out go in here they were they're coming out they said uh Saint John 6 I want to read I'm going to jump down a few script I'm going to start over there Saint John 6 chapter in verse 31 here goes the testimony of these guys that come out there's a Our Father Diddy Manor in the desert and it is written he gave them bread from Heaven to eat then Jesus said unto him unto them Burly verily I said to you Moses Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father gave you the true bread from heaven now I'm gonna drop down the same time here so Jesus began to deal with it here they was craving the name of a prophet Moses David said I'm identify myself under Moses the part of it was they never crossed over Jordan no come on they never went over into the promised land because if they would have they would have been sent Joshua and the one that put us in our place how to position replace the people today we got a group of people that run the message all they can say wait when brother Brandon come back I waited no it ain't brother it gonna be the anointing of Joshua the Holy Ghost I'm on your pastor and he gonna take the word and he's gonna positionally place you in the word hallelujah amen so Jesus began to deal with him and he says here Saint John still six I'm gonna begin I'm gonna read a few personalities because I want you to see them and Jesus said I am the I am the bread of life he did not didn't know how to fight they did your father didn't matter in the wilderness and now what right dead a name that's eternally separated with God anyway he giving them a name he'll father did do this but they are dead the name that's on them is death he would say they are eternally separated from God why because they did not go all the way with the words and he says him he said this is the bread which came down from heaven that it that a man may eat of and die and not die I am the living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat up this of this bread he shall live for what and the bread what that I get will give is my flesh which I would give for the life of the world so Jesus is dealing with her now he did he he's telling him this year he's trying he's contacting him and he's calling him by name if you notice right here he's taking the scripture and he's going to call that name and he says here and the Jews don't among themselves saying who can who can just who can this man give us his flesh to eat and Jesus said unto unto them forever I say unto you except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink and drink his blood you have no life in you honey so he's I'm not going to explain this to you I didn't because if it's Revelation it will catch your attention how these people here did you count on mine they trying to figure this thing out drinking my blood has eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my pleasure to meet indeed and my blood is drinking either eating my flesh and drinking my blood dwelling in me and I am Hallelujah he's going on here he's he's telling him this tell him dropping on that girl since the same time now the verse 59 he said these days he he said in the in the synagogue as he kind of Capone it many of his disciples when they heard this this is a hard saying who can hear it now he's dealing with the ability to put him there because in other words they are testifying and they can hear the word or if they cannot hear the word they're going to tell you where you come from Hallelujah we say Open the Eyes of My Heart that mean to understand it how do you do another word your eyes that you see where don't let you know God how do they saw Jesus that they came out of the two Mary stood there and she was married but but the leader I think went down to the Tomb of Jesus looked at him with a natural eye he was a young man she could not identify who he was so our eyes in the Physical Realm could not open or reveal to what we want but when he called up our name Hallelujah when he called him my name she knew who he was amen that personal Revolution she was able to hear his voice and he says here so they said we can hear it and when Jesus knew in himself that the disciples moment he said unto them just offend you see that what the people did that's what's wrong today you try to preach the Revelation until you're trying to preach Christ and the people get offended oh man I ain't gonna do I ain't gonna put up with that who you getting offended with yeah if if something if the word of God could offend you and run you off is something wrong with your call well I want to tell you Jesus Jesus those things that didn't offend people yeah oh that's right now there go your name right okay okay huh I've done something wrong okay okay okay okay okay okay because okay so you know so you know what I'm trying to say here is that you know when Jesus was saying that he defend Jesus love said they to throw peoples off what you think Jeter would do it when he was dealing with this woman whose name was on the Lamb of the life and she could not be thrown out or be offended when Jesus turned around in that day and said the bread is for the children not your dog to call somebody that time adult was a disgrace oh yeah right it ain't like it is today that come on that's a modern word what's up dog hey what's up dog I mean I'm not a dog Bobby tell me to be one dogs I'm the only kind of dog I got is hot dogs I don't deal with nothing else begin to realize here or you know people don't mind you calling my dog if you call him a big dog yeah was right to decide to say get rid of her yeah they would want this Gentile woman to get out of the way she was Lord an adult before they were concerned and he called her adult hoping that she would just go on and leave but representation she knew a place in the scripture she knew that she was coming to get something from God she said Lord that's right right if you want to call me a dog you will but I'm not leaving I'm not going to leave till I get the clowns that fall for the master table her faith was perseverance that did not come by home will but they came by the will of God that was in her amen but he said does this offend you and if yay shall see the son of man a sinner what he was before then he go to the end of the spirit that quicker right right now he let him know you ain't gonna get this by looking at me you won't have to get this by revelation you want to deal with this Revelation through the spirit realm going fishing with me don't give you a revelation how they're going hunting with me didn't give you this Revelation one of Jesus belt buckle didn't help you Hallelujah that's all right but that ain't what y'all to me he said this is the thing that's spiritually deserved how do you say it is the spirit and quicker to flesh Prophet nothing and that when people still trying to get the flesh ready and ought to be they ought to be trying to get the soul ready and the Soul get ready by the hearing the preaching of the word over and over and over hey he's at the flood Prophet nothing but the words of us because you there are Spirit left in our life now Jesus I want you to notice here he's calling so now he's going to identify he's telling them there's some of you that name is going to be removed today he knew there was going to be some names removed today he said but there are some of you that believe not Jesus was not deceived the word is not deceived he said there's some of you they've been going to church with me I gave power to do this but yet still you don't believe me right he said there's some of you that believe not and Jesus knew from the what who they were that believe not and who shall betray him so he was not deceived by the by the one that was going to betray him the word has spiritually discerned the enemy and then we're here the one they deceived him he hadn't called his name yet I want you to know that the one that we could deceive them he stayed right with them they could not identify it was Judas that was going to betray him how did Jesus never told him that even when he said this they did not even know who he was even when the angels went up to worship before God Satan showed up Jesus was the only one that knew who he was he was so religious that even the angels didn't know we were right he said say what you going man what you doing I need anywhere so we that way take the baptism of the Holy Ghost how did they deal with religious power that we fight against today I mean it ain't the point of it is it ain't the it ain't the man down there drinking and smoking ain't gonna deal with you it's going to be the oldest setting your own ring that come Anointed with this message and turn around to be trainers the truth and Jesus said right here he says here he knew from that he knew he was going to do this job trying to find my place 64. okay yeah I'm 64. he said now some of you he said uh some of you of you that believe nothing you knew from the beginning of who they were that believe not and who should betray him and he said therefore I say unto you that no man can come unto me except it was given unto him of my father so there was only choices of time there was only children's of time they had a period of time that they were going to manifest what was on the inside of them Hallelujah he said from that time many of his disciples went back and won't know more with him Saint John 6 6 6. he removed their name from The Book of Life how did anyone he took that name off then he goes on and says here and he done this turned to me Invasion the 67 brother and Jesus said unto the 12th well yeah also go yeah right yeah this is representation Peter might not know it but his name was there how did Peter might not know his name was there how do you say and then Simon Peter as a lord to whom shall we go yeah to have the words of eternal life Hallelujah I want to tell you that they find me a place right that preached Jesus Christ the same yesterday who shall we go I don't understand that but I know that you are the Christ Hallelujah in other words and Weaver and we believe it we are sure that God of Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus as it is hell not our chosen right clever you and then when I told trouble you but one of you is eternally separated had I chosen travel you and one of you is a a name that cannot be redeemed right he didn't call him he called he that way if you notice he immediately identified how to one of you in the incarnated devil why did Jesus know that Judas would not be saved because judah's name said the sign of prediction right but he had to run his course he knew what he went all the way up to the end of it but he could not go to Pentecost his job was if Judy would have made it to Pentagon the devil would have got to say he would have got to say but God knew he was gonna go to Pentagon and before Pentacles come that was a place in Judah that the devil could come down and become the incarnated Beast man exactly Hallelujah he's old brother yes sir so we began to go here he called that name and he called their name you said brother someone I'm trying to say your name is what position replace you Hallelujah now we begin to go and look at him for a few more minutes we find him the problem with Dylan and he was showing her in other words those names in the how important names is in the church that book on page a 266 he said he said we will also show that there is a group of people whose name have been placed on the record before the foundation of the world cannot under any circumstance have those names removed amen he said well I can do what I want to do that's a good sign that you're not there hell if you want to go out and do the things of the world and then and then where the job was seen like Brother Sam we were talking about that too many people got predestination mixed up they got to preach if I'm predestinated it don't matter if I drink smoke or go out and come in a Dodger Hallelujah I'm predestinated to be there no you're not predestinated how did they go out drink and smoke and run around you are predestinated for one purpose to be conformed into the image of the Living God your life must become Christ don't know how those days removed but we will also show that there's another group of names who's on the on that record book before the foundation of the world will have their names removed something went wrong somewhere show you this they're gonna be two vines in the same one coming out the same holiday I intermingle together but one name cannot be removed under any circumstance and there's another name that can be removed and you said brother that is real confusing oh yes it is if you don't have a revelation right see Judas not only did Judas I want you to understand here 272 in the church here but man says here that Judas did and like Judas they did not all he he did not all the way he did not know the way so how Judas was chosen of God he was instructed in truth he shared the knowledge of the mystery and people said all I got to do is know the Mysteries that's good that's just the first six seals of it right right but the seven sealed of Christ himself I didn't know in the mystery and knowing Christ that's what Paul was saying no you can understand all mystery and not have the person Hallelujah so that people take the mystery for the new birth how did the new bird brings you to the life of Jesus Christ Living on this side of you it must become the mystery must become flesh amen he says right here and he said right here I'm not gonna be all day he shared the knowledge of the mystery he had a Ministry of power granted under him he he healed the sick and cast out devils in Jesus name how there was no other name demon could leave here he had enough uh no doubt he had an intellectual faith if I used his name Demon's going to leave how do you show you that but when The Showdown came he he sold out his he sold out for gold and politic power he did not go up to Pentecost to receive the Holy Ghost he showed that his name could be removed what about all those other people that was with Jesus what happened to that whole group why they was not in Pinnacle but a whole 120. you're right all right all right exactly something went wrong maybe the pressure must have shut them off the word fell into the heart didn't say come to ease here come the evil one and started out at heart because if the world would have stayed in their heart they would have been in Upper Room maybe maybe 5 000 should have went there right all the people that see need Miracles that Jesus did they ought to be in the upper room but what happened the wedding been stolen on that heart right oh Hallelujah so we begin to go and look at this here let us look here I'm talking about names for a second a name that cannot be removed I look it up because you study this here I'm standing this right here Abraham this is just maybe on the scope of Abraham Abraham could have been you know like Abraham himself if you read Abraham commentary and read about the Old Testament about Abraham you will find out that Abraham has some issues Abraham has the missions right the man has some issues I mean you know he he had a little light he didn't even if impression come down he he told little while yeah you know I mean he did I mean and we know the story how Abraham took Hagar and took this woman out of wedlock impregnated with a child that produces Ishmael or illegitimate child hallelu in other words Abraham did not if Abraham if Abram would have been in church today if we would have somebody would told us that he was the father of the faith we would have went right back to his past life he'd known to my father foreign got to be kidding oh man I didn't want to be around that man he told me the father of Fate man I got that little wild boy right there playing rock and roll music even though it was Wild by Nature so you know we begin to go and look at this Earth so we look at all these things Abraham did and only they did he did in other words but the part of it was God called Abraham out of a place of a a place of adultery he caught about a place of paganism how to call Abraham his uh his father household how to come to a land that I'll show you how do there was something that was predestinated something that was for knowledge about God say Abraham leave your home right all that mess in other words he'll go ahead and come out following God halfway believing brother McCann peoples alone he should have been by himself because I got to get your way in the word you got to separate from every day how did your Revelation separate you from everything I did a lot of time me we let people talk with that or be uh people talk outside of it Hallelujah it doesn't want to solve it if my mama don't go on him to me if my daddy don't go to him to me I'd have made up my mind I'm going all the way with God how do you got to make up your run and it ain't about you or your husband it's about you and God hallelujah I believe that we ought to do our best to live together and peace but when they come down to Jesus Christ then when we draw the line here we've got the hell somewhere to draw the line yes sir it goes and says right here so we get we begin to look so God gives him a promise tell him he gonna have a child but he already had a child oh Ishmael and according to the law the firstborn was entitled to the birthright Hallelujah so ain't gonna have to be something that's gonna have to be done because now he's caught in a predicamentally the firstborn Ishmael is the son that was entitled to the birthright but God had a plan how did God had a plan he wanted to show the Heart of Jesus Christ got it at least so God does something different to Abraham he turned around not called him Abram but changed his name now what's his name would change his body could change his past life was done away with him so now with Paul get the mind of God he sees Abraham he said Abraham stopping out at the promise giving God glory and giving God prey when his body was dead said Wu was dead her name was changed God put the H in his books of himself in them he put and through this Abraham body was able to have a body check now I want you to notice here well God looked at Abraham he never saw Abrams he never saw Abraham because Abram was done away with that name was done away with it when he looked at Abra he saw Abraham honey he saw him under another Covenant how do you say Abraham now I'm gonna get a boat right to the right side I'm not even mentioned Israel but all by either you're only well that's all right I thank God to your only son but what about him he would not even count it he might have been counted under Abram under your first Union under the devil might have this on your life and you might have done it but when God save you he gave you a new name and if God don't see your own book the point of it is we can't get rid of it we still digging up a dick oh I've done so many of us if you've got a true Revelation you got a name change Hallelujah tell me we're going to look at him there's another I'm gonna put my parachute on now so hold on another one got to preach at two o'clock listen I my boy's getting to feel a little scratchy amen amen but here we are we're looking God deal with people here's what God dealing with it here he was dealing with Jacob how did what did it mean the name means to planner a little deceiver and Jacob did all these things he deceived Esau he deceited he deceived and follow he had a bad a title behind his name and he could not be coming in power position with God under the name of Jacob so God Rising with him and changed his name from Jacob to Israel oppressed with God and it didn't begin to Prevail right Peter did not have a good testimony you read about Peter his testimony was not really that good not invite Peter had a little issue Jesus knew he had a little issues you know Jesus deal when one time come down into the lake down in naked swimming yeah I don't know what his problem was Hallelujah Peter walk around with an attitude anything go down you don't have to worry about me I got your back yeah yeah that's the way his attitude was and Jesus knew this dude you know you know what you know what Gina wouldn't he didn't judge him he just knew that he needed to go to Pentacles to get the Holy Ghost you know he won them kind of guys you know hey I got your back let something go down yeah and he proved that man cut a man girl Jesus said what you doing boy you're gonna get everybody killed you didn't find out you've done that said you didn't put it up by going he didn't leave a scar come shoot at me and try to show what happened back in the man had something wrong I mean you you got your ear put back on there ain't no scar you talking about a man because you are man you need a vacation honey but in the words of Jesus knew that Peter Jesus but also Jesus knew that Peter loved him that was the thing it was Jesus knew that Peter had a love for God hallelujah even though his body wouldn't acting like it yeah that was a representation by fortnightly he loved God and did Jesus asked him a word or two do you love me being a young Lord feed my lamb Peter Do It Do You Love Me fever she beat it you look wait a minute don't you ask me that again if you ain't ready yet in his heart Peter knew I'm not uh Peter knew God knew that Peter loved him so much that Peter would have got in the way yeah oh it would have been a problem because Peter had attitude I'm not banging down yeah so Jesus said man you're gonna mess this playing up I hate to do you this way buddy but I don't have to prophesy with you you know in other words you know it they're going to play and work it out just right and you got Peter there with a bad attitude ready to go over these guys Hallelujah I can go to Calvary by myself if not me and you both gonna be hanging right right now we're getting ready to happen so Jesus said Peter before the Concord three times just said the Lord where's what he was saying because it had to come to pass right if Gina would have spoken and Peter would have never denied him it would have been something wrong with the prophecy but the word cannot be broken so Jesus had to take the word of Prophecy and thus said the Lord Peter Hallelujah before the conquer you'll deny me right Peter thinking what's wrong with him but he did it right he might not realize why he done it he done it he didn't have no judgment to do it right but Judah denied him by choice he had a choice to accept Jesus he denied him by choice he's pee so that but Peter didn't have a choice he had prophecy so dude don't get don't get it mixed up it ain't that Peter this didn't he not I hear people say he's a renegade he denied Jesus he should have denied Jesus prophesied over you to do it that same thing you gonna do right Hallelujah it ain't nothing else you can do so but the point of it is I want you to understand something but I want you to know all the things that Peter did what you doing oh his attitude everything when Jesus asking one question who the man said it to him and he said he died of Christ are you doing some call you this man some call your job I didn't begin to go he could hold it yeah I did not use second hand revelation Peter says now to Christ the son of the Living God and when Peter said this Jesus looked at him and said Peter change his name saying the name to a name they cannot be separated from God under any circumstance and Peter now he's up on this name up on this rock which is that little name the name Peter mean a little Stone up under this little skull about the disc Revelation right here I will build my church Hallelujah and I will build my church and the Gates of Hell will fight it all away but I'm gonna let you know under this name right here the Gates of Hell shall not be able to overcome I mean Peter had it and I'm going to give you the keys to my house and if you don't make it I ain't gonna be able to get in right now come once Jesus give me something he don't take it back how did Jesus don't give you something one day and say I want it back to next day I'm giving you hell the keys to the kingdom of heaven before this boy even had the Holy Ghost based up on his Revelation that came from God how did his Revelation came from God he gave him the key based up on Revelation that came from God up on this run after it was not what Peter was doing in the flesh but his Revelation how did that cave of God but hold him all the way to the end of the world and then I went to your word and we know the story here Peter goes here he goes here and he rejected Christ no doubt falls under the depression sure could you reject God you're going to be on some depression I'm sure that devil probably trying to talk him into committing suicide like Judas boy you don't mess up buddy you know messed up I'll say how you gonna make it now but when Jesus come out conquered them grave in hell I want you to notice he beginning to take he he was he told us that go tell my disciples that I have risen right then he stops he said I want to make this a personal right and Peter right so when Peter heard him that and Peter that was enough to let him know how to I Believe by the grace of God he know I'm going to be there he did something for Peter that he never did but Judith he prayed for Peter he didn't pray that his flesh wouldn't get weak he prayed that his faith wouldn't fail and if God pray for your Revelation I don't care how many Devils go I don't care what cup you would never separate yourself from revelation my last one I'm closing you remember him Professor a name that couldn't be removed under any circumstance circumstances totally had removed Paul yeah from the book if we would look at it in that way he said brother no sir oh yes sir because Paul blasphemed against the word the Bible Paul said he did right and he Deport Paul said I bless him but if service death could have removed Paul Paul should not have made it because he come against a scripture that had told anybody to touch not my anointed and do my prophets no harm right and Paul killed Stephen if you notice Paul killed Steve a man full of the Holy Ghost how did the Bible say full of the Holy Ghost anointed of God Paul should have been scratched off the book right but I want to let you know Hallelujah and he would have been scratched off the book but his name was changed probably his name was changed what Saul done he had to do away with it and then so with the spirit of the Lord called him he did not call himself I call you Paul Paul never killed Stephenson it was solid kills demons but when God called him he changes man the same way God call you he changed your name amen said here he says I don't no longer call you Church because I call your brother you know he brought him out of Pentecost now they was in the courtship they became bright courtship is is the good that's no doubt that's some of the best times of you know before life set in is the courtship because that's when the girls getting all the cookies he come to the house with the flowers she she don't eat much yeah yeah it's a type of romance either she living on these dumb love letters you hear what he's saying wow look at my dad that's the only thing my girls walked around for months with lettuce I would look at them and they'd be walking through the house I sneaked in there and read one of them letters kitty smell right I'm thinking once you all worked up about this little I don't see nothing but she saw between the lines she saw something between the line how much is a secret I can see it I'm thinking man this guy he got a long way to go you got eyes like the seven to see you you got wings like a eagle oh man all these beautiful sands and all that did it and under this courtship stage stay so called up yeah yeah they forget about things it's the dumb as your daughter probably I'm a kid that's when they don't think what they put anything I just come home in the night ice cream in this microwave and I'm thinking what in the world is going on with my daughters I walk in the room I say who put the ice cream in the microwave I don't know what you mean you don't know I don't know how I got there when somebody put it there it was not me yeah this dumb stuff was happening that was under that courtship abroad his bride to be she called Brian and none of that of course you know it just stays like that was happening in my house because one of my girls got both my girls one of them got married and they shouldn't got married so I had two dumb daughters at one time well I'm so glad boy I said man I told my wife they're gonna have to get out but anyway so it went on there but under that courtship stage I'm gonna let you know this I would let when that boy would come to his house he would come to my house man it was a real good cat you know he'll come and pick her up and they will go out under that courtship and my daughter was losing weight like crazy yeah it's my baby girl she was already little and she probably lost 30 pounds I'm thinking you're gonna vanish before you get married and uh but anyway she was not even eating because under the courtship stage it's the best day the guy he carry you out to eat and you get to maybe Burger King and he said that he said I'm gonna buy it I'm gonna buy me a uh whatever Big Mac now that's a McDonald a waffle is that what you do you want one she'll say now so you don't just say no I just eat some of yours and he thinking in his mind man this is gonna be easy and man she's not expensive at all and it's gonna be all right hey yeah you got a lot to learn buddy here you go down and she'll sit there and she'll take a cup of french fries you want some mom nah that's all I want he oh man I got all this to myself but that changes what's that word I do what's that word I pronounce you man and wife right then God put elected term in her mouth do you know I didn't know she like that that design thing changes but I want to let you know that was under the bride that's under the courtship right right in other words people's death what happened in this day they don't stayed under the courtship so long under the gifts so long that they didn't go all the way into the next room so when the boy would come to my house my son-in-law would date my daughters they I gave him permission they could come to my house they're not going to do I walked to the door and he and I remember to engage but only he was allowed that go in my living room and my kitchen under bride that's all the underground and then she's been his bride to be they was only allowed he could come in my living room sit there and laugh and talk it was no problem I invite him to the kitchen and then he said in the kitchen we can laugh and talk but then Robert said this message is a three-room house under the under the anointing of bride he could not go no further but once the veil would lifted and he kissed his bride right did he could come to my house now he can stay all night and he can sleep in the bedroom but he could not do that how did it and it went so when I'm trying to save people as long as you are the brine you might have all again but he said here in Revelation 10 he do not Revelation 19 and verse 7 and I don't know I don't know but call you Brian I don't no longer call you bro I I call you wife the wife have made himself ready because now you are pregnant if you got pregnant before you well before the veteran something was wrong you could not be called wife and musicians come back stands in Christ and Mr God revealed he said the wound is closed if the wound is cold that means that you're a wife hallelujah we're behind the veil now you know you're big right Hallie you are pregnant in church with the revelation of Jesus Christ may God bless you this morning I'm going to stop you I just trust God like that song named son maybe they can play that again Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord let me look in here and find myself what do I stand in the message of this day all right you stand in the revelation of God's word Glory you might not be what you want to be what's keeping you all to yours the trials you had the failures you had the tests you had and you begin to realize it was gone all the time when you look back through when you look back through life and you see the path you went down you think I wouldn't want nobody to go down that path but somewhere you was able to get down that path and you're still hanging on to Jesus Christ that is amazing grace that's amazing grace the things we don't went through and we love God more today you don't want them longer you live with your wife when you first get married the first few years is just infatuation yeah you don't learn to love until you go to the trials and y'all work them trials out and you go through another trial you said well my wife ain't never gave me no trouble she must be dead if your wife I got the perfect wife you better go down and see it and you get I mean but you know I got the perfect husband here you're gonna have to work these things out how do you got to fight through it but the point of it is but my wife been together for 34 to almost 35 years now probably the last 20 years we started
