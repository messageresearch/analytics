[3:26] blessing upon the reading of the word
[3:28] now open it to us Lord Jesus we pray in
[3:30] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[3:35] so again I'm gonna be kind of going
[3:39] through the seven feasts but I'm reading
[3:41] from Daniel and Haggai which seems kind
[3:43] of strange
[3:44] let's read Daniel chapter 2 verse 1 and
[3:47] it says and the first year of Darius the
[3:49] son of a higher heiress of the get my
[3:54] notes here so I can read it of the seed
[3:57] of the Medes which was made king over
[3:59] the realm of the Chaldeans and the first
[4:02] year of his reign I Daniel understood by
[4:05] books the number of the years aware of
[4:07] the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah
[4:09] the Prophet that he would accomplish
[4:11] seventy years and the desolations of
[4:14] Jerusalem and I set my face under the
[4:19] Lord God to seek by prayer and
[4:20] supplications with fasting and sackcloth
[4:22] and ashes I'm just gonna skip down to
[4:25] save a little bit of time down to verse
[4:27] 17 where he says now therefore O our God
[4:30] as he's finishing up his prayer he says
[4:32] hear the prayer of thy servant and his
[4:34] supplications and caused thy face to
[4:37] shine upon thy sanctuary that is
[4:39] desolate for the lord's sake now let's
[4:42] go over to Haggai chapter 2 verse 1
[4:45] through 7 in the seventh month and the
[4:51] one and twentieth day of the month came
[4:53] the word of the lord by the prophet
[4:55] haggai i say and i highlighted the
[4:58] things i want you to pay a special
[4:59] attention to tonight because this is in
[5:01] the seventh month something something
[5:03] very interested in mysterious is taking
[5:05] place in the seventh month and the
[5:08] seventh month and the one and twentieth
[5:10] day of the month came the word of the
[5:11] lord by the prophet a guy saying
[5:13] speaking out as aruba bull the son of
[5:15] shealtiel governor
[5:17] juda and to joshua the son of josedech
[5:19] the high priest and to the residue of
[5:21] the people saying who was left among you
[5:23] that saw this house in our first glory
[5:25] and how do you see it now is it come on
[5:30] brother why is it not in your eyes in
[5:35] comparison of it as nothing think about
[5:38] that who who has seen this house and her
[5:40] first glory think about that in the
[5:43] context of what I'm speaking on the
[5:44] return of the glory yet now be strong
[5:47] those aruba Bowl saith the Lord
[5:51] and be strong or Joshua son of josedech
[5:55] the high priest and be strong all you
[5:58] people of the land saith the Lord and
[6:00] work for I am with you saith the Lord of
[6:02] Hosts according to the word that I
[6:06] Covenant is with you when you came out
[6:08] of Egypt see y'all y'all know I get
[6:14] leaky just bear with me a second so my
[6:19] spirit remaineth among you fear you not
[6:21] for thus saith the Lord of hosts yet
[6:24] once it is a little while and I will
[6:26] shake the heavens and the earth and the
[6:28] sea and the dry land and look what he's
[6:31] doing here now and that's in kind of a
[6:33] three-fold way he's doing three things
[6:34] here so pay attention
[6:35] I highlight of them there so you can you
[6:37] get something good and I will shake the
[6:43] heavens in the earth and the sea and the
[6:45] dry land and I will shake all nations so
[6:49] he's going to shake all nations and then
[6:52] what's he gonna do and the desire of all
[6:54] nations shall come nigh tree shaking all
[6:57] nations then the desire is gonna come
[6:59] and then what's gonna happen then I will
[7:03] fill this house with glory saith the
[7:06] Lord of Hosts the silver is mine and the
[7:08] gold is mine saith the Lord of Hosts the
[7:11] glory of this latter house shall be
[7:13] greater than of the former saith the
[7:14] Lord of Hosts and in this place will I
[7:16] give peace saith the Lord of Hosts you
[7:19] may be seated the Lord is blessing to
[7:21] the reading of the work
[7:25] now y'all back there in the back just
[7:28] kind of have your finger on that your
[7:30] trigger finger on that Mouse so you can
[7:31] pull those scriptures back up again cuz
[7:33] I'm gonna refer to them just for a
[7:34] little bit while we well we kind of get
[7:36] started here but I want to keep your
[7:39] kind of keep in the end in your mind
[7:41] what we're talking about is in Haggai he
[7:44] says in the seventh month in the seventh
[7:46] month because if you look in the feast
[7:48] days they're kind of they kind of go
[7:50] that and I'm gonna be kind of real high
[7:53] level tonight uh you know it's Wednesday
[7:56] night and I'm not gonna dive down into
[7:57] every little aspect and detail all the
[7:59] different feasts I'm just gonna kind of
[8:01] lay out the big plan of redemption in
[8:04] the feast because you know as a brother
[8:07] brother Wade and brother Dowley bringing
[8:09] out the seals and and and all the
[8:11] different things everything just kind of
[8:13] ties together and you know you kind of
[8:15] get to a place where you think well you
[8:18] know why do we need to understand Daniel
[8:20] 70 weeks why do we need to understand
[8:21] the feast why do we need to understand
[8:23] all these things that maybe a lot of
[8:25] preachers have made real complicated in
[8:27] things but but there's something in here
[8:31] that IIIi believe I believe God called
[8:35] me to kind of help identify the bride
[8:37] honestly if you and I believe there's
[8:39] something in here some of the mystery in
[8:42] here that that identifies who you are
[8:44] that that when you see it then you begin
[8:47] to realize the day in the hour that
[8:48] you're living in your plan and purpose
[8:50] that you have in your life what you're
[8:52] here for and what God is doing and have
[8:55] begun begins to unfold to you into a
[8:57] living reality where you can see that
[9:00] like like Daniel did when he looked and
[9:02] he saw he looked back into what Jeremiah
[9:04] had written and about what even what
[9:06] Zechariah are not Zakaria but all the
[9:09] prophets that had gone before he knew
[9:11] something was taking place and he knew
[9:13] if Jeremiah had said that they would be
[9:15] in bondage for seven decades and that
[9:18] they were toward the end of that second
[9:20] seven decades then something's got to be
[9:22] taking place and so he got he got down
[9:25] on his knees and I began to pray and
[9:27] fast and call upon God and God help me
[9:30] to help me to be right is there anything
[9:32] in my life that's not right and began to
[9:34] call and and at the end of that prayer
[9:36] you begun to call out that God
[9:38] cause thy face to shine upon thy
[9:40] sanctuary that is desolate because when
[9:43] they had gone into bondage the
[9:44] Babylonians had taken out all the
[9:46] ornaments and all the different things
[9:48] all that they've taken the Ark of the
[9:49] Covenant out of there and the ark had
[9:51] become lost when that as they went into
[9:53] Babylonian bondage so he's calling out
[9:55] to God that God would bring glory back
[9:57] to that sanctuary that now had become
[10:00] desolate and I believe it's time for us
[10:03] to realize the day that were and the
[10:04] hour that we're living in if you could
[10:06] look into these seven feasts these seven
[10:08] feasts and realize how close we've got
[10:10] to be to seeing to seeing the body
[10:13] change not I believe we're seeing right
[10:16] now they're coming of the Lord it's not
[10:18] something that we can put off it but yet
[10:20] for years people have put it off of some
[10:22] kind of future event but but it the
[10:24] shout is now the voice is now the only
[10:28] the only thing remaining is right there
[10:30] trump the last trump does our body
[10:31] change to take place and we're right on
[10:34] the cusp of that so now it's time for us
[10:37] to get serious and get back into the
[10:39] word and figure out what it takes for
[10:41] the glory to come back into the
[10:42] sanctuary so that we can see the glory
[10:45] return to be something greater than that
[10:48] initial glory because let's see what I'm
[10:51] talking about in there in the first
[10:52] church age the the initial glory that
[10:56] fell on the day of Pentecost that was
[10:57] glorious that was a wonderful thing but
[11:00] this glory this glory will be something
[11:03] in early clue that hidden manna them
[11:05] boses put aside and said only the high
[11:07] priest can go in and eat of that it'll
[11:09] include something special that was
[11:11] reserved that was set aside where when
[11:13] that white that capstone was opened up
[11:16] in there and the dream that the person
[11:18] had and and and next and that the
[11:21] individual said look on this I think it
[11:23] was brother Branham I'm kind of shooting
[11:25] from the hip here a little bit when you
[11:31] begin to think about with that kind of
[11:33] glory this will be far more glorious
[11:35] than that initial glory but what does it
[11:38] take to have that kind of glory to see
[11:40] that kind of glory made manifest in this
[11:41] church and I'm not talking about just
[11:43] feel good or anything I'm not talking
[11:45] about just you know running up and down
[11:47] the aisles but I'm talking about a glory
[11:49] that so takes over the believer so it
[11:53] conquers the believer conquers
[11:55] everything in the believers life until
[11:57] it conquers their flesh and their flesh
[11:59] is changed that's the kind of glory
[12:02] that's gonna as you see that kind of
[12:04] glory will not come until the seventh
[12:08] month if we're looking in the feast days
[12:09] and into the feast so let's just kind of
[12:13] let's just kind of back up here a little
[12:15] bit and kind of run through the feasts
[12:16] so you got it in the beginning you got
[12:18] the Passover unleavened bread
[12:20] firstfruits Pentecost that's the first
[12:23] four right and what that just to kind of
[12:25] simplify it for you a little bit Jesus
[12:27] died he he was buried and then he rose
[12:30] again and then on the day of Pentecost
[12:32] 50 days later fifty days after the after
[12:34] the resurrection then then the Holy
[12:37] Ghost fell the Holy Spirit fell and
[12:38] quickened the word that they had heard
[12:40] and now you've got something in-between
[12:42] you got this this gap they see there's a
[12:44] lot a lot of mysterious gaps and a lot
[12:46] of people don't realize don't understand
[12:48] you've got this gap between the feast of
[12:51] Pentecost which we're in now because the
[12:52] bride is still fulfilling this Feast of
[12:54] Pentecost
[12:55] we're in the feast of Pentecost but then
[12:57] one day there's going to come oh we say
[13:01] one day but let's keep it let's keep it
[13:02] present tense
[13:03] because right now Israel is back in
[13:06] their homeland the Feast of Trumpets is
[13:08] supposed to drive Israel back to their
[13:10] homeland the Day of Atonement is
[13:12] supposed to Israel is supposed to
[13:14] realize what they had done that realized
[13:16] that they had killed the one that killed
[13:18] a very Messiah the realized that that
[13:20] that the price had been paid with the
[13:23] scapegoat and all different things you
[13:25] realize what's going on and then the
[13:27] last Trump that the sounding of the last
[13:29] truck the kingdoms of our Lord I've
[13:30] become the kingdoms of his Christ and
[13:32] all those things in other words he just
[13:35] takes takes over he completely takes
[13:36] over when you see the revelation of what
[13:41] happens in those lasts in that last
[13:44] seventh month and that seventh months
[13:47] has been hidden from the world the first
[13:50] four feasts were hidden from the Jews
[13:52] they had no idea what took place in
[13:54] those first four feasts the feast of
[13:56] Pentecost the Feast of the firstfruits
[13:57] all those different things but the last
[14:00] three feasts have been hidden for mayor
[14:01] her body and everybody's grasping at
[14:03] straws trying to understand what those
[14:05] piece of mean and so you see even maybe
[14:08] maybe not to be too critical but maybe
[14:10] even message believers well they're
[14:12] they'll see things we're brother Brown
[14:13] said that the the feast of the trumpets
[14:15] was for the Jews only which it was the
[14:18] Feast of the trumpets was we're not
[14:20] going back to the land of Israel but yet
[14:22] you can look at those things and realize
[14:24] that there's something taking place
[14:25] through the bride there's something
[14:28] taking place in parallel like Naomi
[14:29] Andrews and marching back into the
[14:31] marching back into the homeland together
[14:33] they're marching back Ruth is marching
[14:35] back into a spiritual homeland while
[14:37] naming a name naomi is marching back to
[14:40] her natural homeland at the same time
[14:43] and so you can begin to see something
[14:44] taking place but but kind of keeping
[14:47] your mind I hope I hope you're following
[14:49] well I would have kind of you know
[14:51] simplify Fisher Price it down like like
[14:54] we say I say sometimes Fisher Price it
[14:56] down so it's just real easy to
[14:58] understand hopefully I believe God's it
[15:01] the fivefold ministry to to break down
[15:03] these big old nuggets so that they're
[15:04] easily not to digest that there is so
[15:07] you know I believe the gift of the
[15:09] fivefold ministry is you just lay it out
[15:10] so playing that you just about have to
[15:12] stumble over it to get around it you
[15:13] just it's just so so right there in
[15:16] front of you that oh my goodness I can't
[15:18] help but see it and so that's my intent
[15:20] tonight let's pull up a quote number one
[15:26] a because brother Branham I just maybe
[15:28] want to start on this well brother Brown
[15:31] maybe not so much about the feast but
[15:33] he's talking to the he's kind of
[15:34] expounding on the message in Revelation
[15:37] to the ephesian church age where where
[15:40] God is telling them to remember how what
[15:44] you have fallen from remember your first
[15:46] love to look back and remember and that
[15:50] God can restore the glory to you and he
[15:53] says God tells them to remember
[15:54] evidently something had left their minds
[15:57] they had forgotten something
[15:59] oh you can't you just apply that to this
[16:01] day that something simple something got
[16:04] forgot down through these seven churches
[16:06] now he's talking to the Ephesian Church
[16:09] hey don't get confused here he's talking
[16:11] to the Ephesian Church age that they had
[16:12] for
[16:13] and how they started off on the day of
[16:14] Pentecost but now we're supposed to be
[16:17] an Ephesian Church we're not supposed to
[16:18] be in a little Corinthian baby church
[16:20] we're supposed to be a mature place
[16:22] Church coming to adoption
[16:24] we're supposed to be applied church that
[16:26] is well grounded in the word and we're
[16:28] supposed to be able to look back to see
[16:30] what we came from look back and have an
[16:33] understanding of what's taking place
[16:36] they had forgotten something he told
[16:38] them to turn back in their to in their
[16:40] minds to their point of origin
[16:42] the origin of the first age was
[16:44] Pentecost they had fallen from it they
[16:46] had forgotten the glory and wonder of it
[16:48] they had forgotten the glory
[16:50] oh my we're not supposed to be a
[16:52] defeated church tossed about every which
[16:55] way it was time to go back in mind and
[16:59] then a reality back to when they could
[17:01] say for me to live as Christ back to
[17:03] purity and in it when Ananias and
[17:05] Sapphira dealt with back to the gate
[17:07] beautiful
[17:08] oh what a reproach it is to drift from
[17:10] God and countenance those acts to defile
[17:13] his name let those who name his name
[17:15] depart from sin and keep their vessels
[17:17] pure for God look at what you once were
[17:19] in your heart and mind and in your life
[17:21] then go back to it and what is the way
[17:24] back the way is the way of repentance if
[17:26] a sinner has to come to God by way of
[17:29] repentance then the lukewarm a
[17:30] backslider will have to repent that much
[17:32] more repent
[17:33] bring forth fruits meet for repentance
[17:35] prove it by your life if you do not
[17:38] repent said God I will remove your
[17:40] lampstand certainly a church in that
[17:42] condition can't give like to the world
[17:44] as light as turned to darkness God will
[17:47] then take away it's a faithful messenger
[17:48] and his faithful Shepherds and leave
[17:50] them to themselves and they will go on
[17:51] talking about Christianity but be bereft
[17:54] of it he said repent and he keeps going
[17:58] on but there at the end he said but it
[18:00] must be quickly it must be a true heart
[18:02] to cry to God and sorrow and then God
[18:05] will restore the glory shall come again
[18:09] the glory shall come again and maybe
[18:11] tonight if there any of you have kind of
[18:13] in a backslidden condition where it's
[18:15] been a long time since you've felt the
[18:17] presence of the Lord it's been a long
[18:19] time since you've been consecrated to
[18:20] God it's been a long time since since
[18:23] you've been in a place where but you
[18:24] come down and locks one another's feet a
[18:26] communion that you
[18:27] feel the presence of the Lord come down
[18:28] then maybe you need to get down on your
[18:30] knees and repent and call out to God and
[18:32] make sure that everything's right with
[18:33] you because God is able to destroy the
[18:36] glory he's able to bring it back to you
[18:38] back to the way it was if you look back
[18:40] and remember how it was when you first
[18:42] met God when you first got down on your
[18:44] knees back in the back side of the
[18:46] desert or wherever it was do you
[18:48] remember
[18:48] I want to bring to your remembers
[18:50] tonight how it was the first time the
[18:52] first time that you met the Lord and
[18:54] remember that he is able to restore
[18:56] there is a balm in Gilead to take to
[18:59] take over to take the thing the things
[19:01] over your eyes that are hindering you
[19:02] from being it'll see the glory of God
[19:04] God is able to bring us back to the way
[19:07] that it was God is able to bring us back
[19:10] in this day to the way that it was at
[19:12] the day of Pentecost but even more so
[19:14] because he's given us more in this days
[19:17] and then they had their he's given us a
[19:19] capstone revelation he's gonna given us
[19:22] a revelation for a body change and all
[19:25] that unfolds in the seventh the seventh
[19:27] month let me get my bearings
[19:33] so think Daniel they came out of bondage
[19:38] that came out of captivity and the glory
[19:41] of the Lord was not there they began to
[19:44] build as a rouble and went as Zechariah
[19:46] and Haggai began to prophesy on the
[19:48] rebuilding of the temple they began to
[19:51] rebuild the temple they began to get
[19:52] everything back put back the way it was
[19:54] but then yet the glory of the Lord could
[19:57] not come into that temple because there
[19:58] was some requirements that we're missing
[20:00] and so you know we talked about
[20:02] repentance and saying how can you repent
[20:04] unless you hear the word how can you how
[20:06] can you how do you know to come to God
[20:07] unless the word be preached and that's
[20:09] why the preaching of the word is so
[20:11] important how could you make one move
[20:12] toward God except the word and so when
[20:14] you get the word back when you get the
[20:16] word back then the glory will come what
[20:19] what was missing was that the Ark of the
[20:21] Covenant had gone missing when the Bible
[20:22] during the Babylonian captivity and so
[20:25] after they got it all built they didn't
[20:27] have the Ark of the Covenant with the
[20:28] tables of stone they didn't have that to
[20:29] be able to put back into the temple and
[20:31] so work how can the glory come
[20:34] and when the glory did come when Jesus
[20:36] himself finally walked into the temple
[20:38] they didn't recognize it they failed to
[20:40] recognize it to you in a second they
[20:42] failed to recognize when the glory did
[20:44] come and I wondered today if we fail to
[20:46] recognize when the glory is among us
[20:48] when the glorious sitting on the pews in
[20:50] the church veiled in human flesh its
[20:53] veiled but it's unveiled it's revealed
[20:55] but it's still hidden
[20:57] it's a mystery that's that's sitting in
[20:59] the pews in our churches
[21:00] that's preaching behind our purpose
[21:02] that's walking through through the
[21:04] offices and on the streets and all
[21:06] around it's walking on two feet it's
[21:08] walking in your your feet it's eh using
[21:11] your eyes and using your lips
[21:13] he's veiled in your flesh and that's
[21:15] where the glory is hidden this glow is
[21:17] glory is hidden in you and I Oh Daniel
[21:24] Daniel long to see that glory be
[21:26] returned to the sanctuary and when it
[21:29] finally was listen let's go back to
[21:32] first Kings chapter eight and let's see
[21:34] how that glory first came into the
[21:36] temple then I oh goodness that clock is
[21:44] moving so fast oh my that's it that's
[21:48] the preachers enemy of the clock right
[21:49] there first Kings chapter eight says
[21:55] then Solomon assemble the elders of
[21:58] Israel Israel now do you see there's a
[22:01] mystery hidden in the scriptures here of
[22:03] what's taking place in this seventh
[22:05] month in the seventh month the first
[22:07] thing to happen that has to happen is
[22:08] there has to be an assembly do you see
[22:10] what the mystery of the Feast of the
[22:12] trumpets is the Feast of the trumpets
[22:13] has to gather Israel they they can't
[22:16] understand what's going on till they get
[22:17] gathered back to the promised land
[22:19] so first thirty first four therefore the
[22:21] glory to fall there's got to be a
[22:22] gathering and so we assemble the elders
[22:25] of Israel and all the heads of the
[22:26] tribes the chief of the fathers of the
[22:28] children of Israel under King Solomon
[22:30] and Israel that they might bring up the
[22:32] Ark of the Covenant of the Lord out of
[22:33] the City of David which is design oh my
[22:36] god they're putting the Ark of the
[22:37] Covenant you put that word into the
[22:39] temple you put that word into your
[22:41] tabernacle and the glory is bound to
[22:44] fall the
[22:45] the Gloria you want to know how to get
[22:46] the new birth tonight you want to know
[22:48] how to get adoption tonight that is you
[22:50] put the word in there and the glory is
[22:52] gonna fall and all I see and all the men
[22:59] of Israel assemble themselves and the
[23:01] King Solomon at a feast in the month
[23:02] asanam which is what month the seventh
[23:06] month and all the Israel's elders of
[23:09] Israel came and the priests took up the
[23:10] ark and they brought up the Ark of the
[23:12] Lord and the tabernacle of the
[23:13] congregation and all the holy vessels
[23:15] that were in the tabernacle even those
[23:17] that the priests and the Levites a'lamin
[23:20] and all the congregation of Israel that
[23:22] were assembled on him were with him
[23:23] before they are sacrificing sheep and
[23:25] oxen that cannot be told nor number for
[23:27] multitude and the priests brought in the
[23:29] Ark of the Covenant of the Lord unto his
[23:31] place into the Oracle of the house to
[23:33] the most holy place even under the wings
[23:35] of the cherubims do you know in the New
[23:37] Testament that it says for you to speak
[23:40] as of the Oracles of God a minister is
[23:42] supposed to speak a church member a
[23:45] member of the bride is supposed to speak
[23:47] as of the Oracles of God because the
[23:49] Oracle is where the word is and so when
[23:51] they put that word into the tabernacle
[23:52] it was put it into the into the Oracle
[23:55] into the Holy of Holies where the word
[23:56] is and so when you have the word inside
[23:59] now you can distribute it out to others
[24:02] out of your belly will become
[24:03] Wellsprings I believe every everlasting
[24:05] life your wealth spring of flowing water
[24:08] and that is the glory of God the glory
[24:10] of God flowing out from you like that
[24:12] river of life it will flow out of New
[24:14] Jerusalem and others can come to you and
[24:16] drink freely of the waters of life
[24:17] because you got it flowing within you
[24:19] because you are the or you are the
[24:21] living Oracle of God you have to live it
[24:24] you are able to speak when when when you
[24:27] have the word you speak it's God
[24:30] speaking that is what the Oracle is to
[24:35] see people people try to fake it or you
[24:37] know out and the witch doctors and
[24:39] things they try to have somebody tossing
[24:41] bones and everything and people come to
[24:43] them but yet they won't come to a
[24:45] Christian like to find out what what's
[24:48] really going in the day and the day and
[24:50] the hour that we're living in let me
[24:54] stay focused here I'm trying not to run
[24:58] down in the rabbit tree
[25:00] for the chair broom spread forth their
[25:02] two wings over the place of the Ark and
[25:03] the cherubims cover the ark and the
[25:05] staves thereof above and they drew out
[25:07] the stage that the ends of the stage
[25:09] were seen out and their holy place
[25:10] before they all crawl and they were not
[25:11] seen without and there they are under
[25:13] this day there was nothing in the ark
[25:16] saying the two tables of stone in other
[25:18] words there was nothing in that Ark
[25:20] except for the revelation of Jesus
[25:21] Christ there was nothing in that Ark
[25:23] except for the seven seals because the
[25:26] seven seals are there a complete
[25:27] revelation of Jesus Christ the complete
[25:29] revelation of what how he's going to
[25:31] redeem you the earth how he's going to
[25:33] manifest himself in you how he's going
[25:35] to take everything back to himself the
[25:37] complete redemption plan everything is
[25:39] in that and that was that was the two
[25:41] tables of stone they thought it was a
[25:44] book of rules but it was the revelation
[25:46] of who he was and they put that into the
[25:48] tabernacle which Jesus put there
[25:52] adorable when the Lord made a covenant
[25:54] with the children of Israel when they
[25:55] came out of the land of Egypt and it
[25:57] came to pass when the priests were
[25:58] coming out of the holy place that the
[26:00] cloud filled the house of the Lord so
[26:03] that the priests could not stand a
[26:04] minister because of the cloud for the
[26:06] glory of the Lord and filled the house
[26:08] of the Lord and says do you see how the
[26:10] glory of the Lord has made manifest the
[26:12] glory of the Lord was made manifest then
[26:14] in a cloud what will it look like in
[26:17] this day when he comes forth from the
[26:18] Day of Atonement front with that plant
[26:20] with that cloud the smokiness from
[26:22] within the holy of holies when he comes
[26:25] forth to make himself manifest this son
[26:27] of man what would it look like when he
[26:29] comes forth to make himself manifest in
[26:34] a cloud oh but when he came when he came
[26:41] veiled in his flesh when he came to that
[26:44] temple that zerubu had built they didn't
[26:47] recognize him see we think the coming of
[26:50] the Lord we got to get rid of all these
[26:52] traditions that denominations had put in
[26:54] our minds that the coming of the Lord is
[26:56] this this great thing that the whole
[26:58] world is gonna stop although all the cop
[27:00] cars and all the planes and jets are
[27:02] gonna stop because of the coming of the
[27:03] Lord what it's going to be is so
[27:05] mysterious so secret that it'll be like
[27:08] this this this secret trip that Jesus
[27:11] made to the temple that I'm
[27:12] read for you in John chapter 7 a secret
[27:15] that nobody realized he told him he
[27:17] wasn't gonna go but then he secretly
[27:18] went let's read let's go over to John
[27:20] chapter three number three the quote
[27:24] number three where he said after these
[27:26] things I see now now I'm getting worried
[27:29] about the clock
[27:29] come on now here we go I'm trying to be
[27:34] mindful seriously it's Wednesday night
[27:36] and everything after these things Jesus
[27:40] walked in Galilee for he would not walk
[27:42] in Jewry because the Jews sought to kill
[27:44] him this is John chapter three it should
[27:46] be quote number three now the Jews Feast
[27:50] of Tabernacles was at hand and if you
[27:53] remember the Feast of Tabernacles was
[27:56] the last feast in the seventh month so
[27:58] you got the Feast of Trumpets the Day of
[28:00] Atonement or the feast of atonement and
[28:02] then the Feast of Tabernacles so this is
[28:09] at the feast of tabernacles his brother
[28:11] and therefore said an EM depart thence
[28:13] Hynson go into Judea that I disciples
[28:16] also may see the works that outdo us for
[28:18] there is no man that do with anything in
[28:20] secret and he himself seeks seeketh to
[28:22] be known openly if thou do these things
[28:24] show thyself to the world in other words
[28:26] show up why don't you show off to
[28:28] everybody why don't you demonstrate all
[28:29] the things that you can do but this is
[28:31] not something that can be shown off this
[28:33] is something secret this is something
[28:35] that happens in your in your private
[28:37] prayer closet this acceptin that happens
[28:39] in your private chamber alone with God
[28:42] this is something that when you're
[28:43] walking to work the world won't see it
[28:45] something that's happened in secret
[28:47] that's why all of a sudden in Matthew 24
[28:50] he said one will be in the bed and one
[28:52] will be taking two will be in the bed
[28:53] and one will be taking one will be left
[28:54] two will be in the field one will be
[28:55] taken one will be left it'll be
[28:57] something so secret then all of a sudden
[28:58] it happens that they're catching away
[29:01] and that's what happens at the Feast of
[29:03] Tabernacles because you realize the
[29:04] Feast of Tabernacles as a body change
[29:06] right the Feast of Tabernacles is
[29:08] changing location changing changing your
[29:10] tabernacle and it'll be secret
[29:20] for neither did his brethren believe it
[29:22] in verse 5 then jesus said unto them my
[29:25] time has not yet come for your time is
[29:27] always ready you can go to the feast
[29:28] anytime you want to but I have a set
[29:30] time that this seventh month can take
[29:33] place I have a set time do you realize
[29:36] if there was not a set time the rapture
[29:38] would have happened way back here but he
[29:41] had to wait for all of us their whole
[29:43] whole rest of the attributes of God to
[29:46] be made manifest down through the seven
[29:47] churches he had to wait for all of us to
[29:50] hear the Gospel message to be breached
[29:52] he had to it took time for all these
[29:55] things to happen but when the fullness
[29:56] of time comes then watch out and he said
[30:02] let's read verse eight go you up into
[30:04] this feast I go not up yet under this
[30:07] feast for my time is not yet full come
[30:09] when he had said these words under them
[30:12] he had bowed still in Galilee but when
[30:14] his brethren were going up then when he
[30:16] also up under the feast not openly but
[30:19] as it were in secret cause it's a secret
[30:23] he doesn't do it in front of everybody
[30:25] he goes to the Feast of Tabernacles the
[30:29] body changed secretly so nobody else
[30:33] will know except for this very special
[30:35] group of people who were in tune with
[30:38] the revelation of the hour who were in
[30:40] tune with what the message is saying in
[30:42] that hour you were in tune with what
[30:45] their purpose is in this hour then the
[30:49] Jews saw the method feast and said where
[30:51] is he
[30:51] and that what what stake about how
[30:54] where's the glory what's what's I don't
[30:56] see anything happening and there was
[30:58] much murmuring among the people
[31:00] concerning him for some said he's a good
[31:02] man others said nay but he deceiveth the
[31:04] people how beget no man spoke speak
[31:06] openly of him for fear of the Jews now
[31:09] about the midst of the feast and I've
[31:11] got these words feasts highlighted
[31:13] because when we get to the seventh
[31:15] occurrence of the word feast in this
[31:17] chapter there'll be something happened
[31:19] that Jesus does that typifies the glory
[31:22] that comes to the Feast of Tabernacles
[31:24] because that's that's the glory that
[31:26] we're looking for right we're not
[31:28] looking for a shiver up our spine or an
[31:30] ice cube drop
[31:31] on our back or something like that we're
[31:33] looking for the glory that will
[31:35] transform our bodies and the Jews
[31:41] marvels verse 15 how knoweth this man
[31:43] letters having never learned
[31:46] Jesus sends for them and said my
[31:48] doctrine is not mine but his that sent
[31:51] me if any man will do his will he shall
[31:53] know of the doctrine whether it be of
[31:56] God or whether I speak of myself he
[31:59] shall know of the doctrine and so
[32:01] there's a fantastic combat to this idea
[32:04] that's floating around this there in the
[32:05] message today that they y-you don't even
[32:08] have to know anything you don't have to
[32:10] know the doctrine you can just come and
[32:12] sit in your church and as long as we
[32:14] know that God sent a prophet as long as
[32:16] we know that we're in the message then
[32:18] then that's all good but he said if you
[32:20] want to do the will of my father if you
[32:22] want to do his will you'll know the
[32:24] doctrine and I believe now we're coming
[32:26] because this is the out let's be honest
[32:28] this is the hour of adoption time this
[32:31] is the hour of knowing what you're doing
[32:33] here this is the hour of understanding
[32:35] your place in the message and I want to
[32:37] keep stressing it I want to kind of keep
[32:39] beating that this is adoption time
[32:41] because that kind of makes people
[32:42] nervous
[32:43] it don't make people nervous to say it's
[32:45] it's time to get the new birth
[32:46] everybody's fine with getting the new
[32:48] birth but when you start talking about
[32:50] taking an adoption get an adoption
[32:52] that's the thing that we're coming
[32:54] that's the thing that we're supposed to
[32:56] be coming to in this hour
[32:57] oh no nobody better be coming to that do
[32:59] you think you're something special
[33:01] that's what comes into people's mind do
[33:02] you think you're getting adopted I
[33:04] thought we were supposed to the
[33:06] believers of the message we're supposed
[33:07] to be coming to a place where we know
[33:09] what's taking place in this hour we're
[33:11] supposed to be receiving a capstone
[33:13] message and what other affect can
[33:15] receive in a capsule message half are
[33:17] there to adopt you of course now if you
[33:20] say you're adopted then you're not
[33:21] adopted that's the cash if you say look
[33:24] at me I'm adopted that that won't work
[33:26] because it's a secret it's a secret
[33:30] revelation that only you will have it's
[33:32] something that only only you and God
[33:34] know something that sums up there's got
[33:38] to be a personal relationship and others
[33:40] around you you might hear them saying I
[33:42] I don't think there's anything going in
[33:44] the message but you know there's
[33:45] something going on in the message you
[33:48] know that God is restoring his glory
[33:50] he's restoring he's taking it back to
[33:52] the original Pentecost the original
[33:54] faith of Pentecost he's bringing us back
[33:57] to a capstone message is what he's doing
[33:59] back to the what kind of capstone the
[34:01] capstone the same capstone that walked
[34:03] into the temple this man this son of man
[34:06] that revealed himself hidden he was
[34:08] veiled but unveiled in the temple he was
[34:11] there preaching in the temple and they
[34:13] didn't know who he was back to that son
[34:17] of man back to that kind of faith
[34:19] oh goodness where was I
[34:23] let's skip down to verse 23 or verse 22
[34:27] he said Moses therefore gave unto you
[34:29] circumcision not because it is a Moses
[34:32] but of the father's and ye on the
[34:33] Sabbath day circumcise a man if a man on
[34:36] the Sabbath day receives circumcision
[34:38] that's the law nothing now remember he's
[34:40] saying this on the on the Feast of
[34:42] Tabernacles which is a body change right
[34:45] if a man on the Sabbath day receives
[34:48] circumcision
[34:49] that's your new birth was of the day of
[34:52] Pentecost on the Sabbath you receive you
[34:55] you receive your circumcision on a
[34:58] little personal Sabbath to you because
[35:01] on that Sabbath you entered into your
[35:03] rest and see now he's talking about two
[35:05] different things he's talking about your
[35:07] circumcision your birth and then he's
[35:10] talking about made every with whole
[35:12] every whit whole this is a glorified
[35:15] person that's been made every wit whole
[35:18] if a man on the Sabbath day receives
[35:21] circumcision that the law of Moses
[35:23] should not be broken are you angry at me
[35:25] because I have made a man every whit
[35:28] hole on the Sabbath day every whit hole
[35:31] are you mad at me because I get somebody
[35:33] the holy Burt holy ghost he's saying are
[35:35] you gonna be mad at me
[35:36] because I've given given brought my
[35:40] glory into somebody now on this on the
[35:43] Feast of Tabernacles the judge not
[35:46] according to the appearance but Judge
[35:47] righteous judgment then said some of
[35:50] them of Jerusalem is not this he whom
[35:52] they seek to kill but
[35:54] lower he speaketh boldly and they say
[35:55] nothing unto Him do the rulers know
[35:58] indeed that this is the very Christ how
[36:01] big it we know this man whence he is but
[36:02] when Christ cometh no man knoweth whence
[36:05] he is then can see they didn't know who
[36:07] he was he was he was veiled to them then
[36:10] cried Jesus in the temple as he saw
[36:12] talks saying you both know me and you
[36:14] know whence I am and I am not come of
[36:16] myself but he that sent me is true whom
[36:18] you know not but I know him for I am
[36:22] from him and he hath sent me do you see
[36:25] not what us what I son of man revelation
[36:27] is if you have this kind of revelation
[36:30] then you know where you came from you
[36:33] know who you are and you know where
[36:35] you're going that's the kind of
[36:36] revelation that the Son of Man ministry
[36:39] has brought in this day then they sought
[36:44] to take him but no man laid hold on it
[36:46] laid hands on him but because his hour
[36:48] was not yet come and many of the people
[36:50] believed on him and said when Christ
[36:52] cometh will he do more miracles than
[36:54] these which this man has done the
[36:56] Pharisees heard that the people murmured
[36:58] such things concerning him and the
[36:59] Pharisees and the chief priests sent
[37:01] officers to take him then said Jesus
[37:03] unto them you had a little while am i
[37:04] with you and then I go and AM that sent
[37:06] me ye shall seek me and shall not find
[37:09] me and where I am thither you cannot
[37:12] come then said the Jews among themselves
[37:15] whither will he go that we shall not
[37:17] find him will he go under the dispersed
[37:20] among the Gentiles and teach the
[37:22] Gentiles what manner of saying is this
[37:25] that he said ye shall seek me and shall
[37:26] not find me and where I am theater ye
[37:28] cannot come and the last day that great
[37:30] day of the feast Jesus stood and cried
[37:33] saying if any man thirst so this is he's
[37:37] saying this at the seventh occurrence of
[37:39] the word feast in this in this chapter
[37:41] about the Feast of the Tabernacles
[37:43] he said if any man thirst let him come
[37:46] unto me and drink he that believeth on
[37:50] me as the scripture has said out of his
[37:53] belly shall flow rivers of living water
[37:56] in other words out of his belly will
[37:59] flow my glory why because the ark has
[38:02] been put in there the king the tablets
[38:05] of stone have been put in the
[38:06] the revelation of Jesus Christ has been
[38:08] put in there and so he's put his glory
[38:10] in there and out of that out of his
[38:12] belly will flow that glory you see and
[38:15] but but see that we're asking him what
[38:18] do you mean that we shall not find you
[38:21] because Jesus is apparently about to go
[38:23] after his death burial and resurrection
[38:25] he would be about to go off the scene
[38:28] and disappear until what was going to
[38:30] take place in this seventh month he
[38:33] would be off the scene doing the work
[38:35] the mediatorial work of the high priests
[38:38] right I hope I'm not overloading you I
[38:46] don't hear any explosions I know this is
[38:53] a lot of thinking for Wednesday night
[38:54] hang on hang on with me listen let's
[39:00] read in Acts chapter 1 verse 6 to 11 I
[39:03] like to take things back to the Bible
[39:05] we're doing a lot of scripture reading
[39:06] at night because when let's see how come
[39:09] it's important to see as these first
[39:12] four feasts are ending and he left he
[39:15] left the scene I believe it was 10 days
[39:18] before the feast of Pentecost or
[39:20] something like that right there close to
[39:22] the date of the feast of Pentecost and
[39:24] so just as those first four feasts were
[39:27] ending which marked the end of his of
[39:29] the work that he came to do then he goes
[39:33] off the scene and he does something down
[39:35] through the seven churches until finally
[39:37] he comes back on the scene again in that
[39:40] seventh month how does he come back on
[39:43] the scene what is the way that he comes
[39:45] back what brings him back on the scene
[39:47] that what brings him back on the scene
[39:49] is the same thing it follows the same
[39:52] pattern as what brought him on the scene
[39:54] when we were reading about how the glory
[39:56] field that Solomon's Temple that all the
[40:00] Israelites gathered together then the
[40:04] glory they put the word in there
[40:06] they assemble together put the word in
[40:10] there and then the glory filled the
[40:12] temple
[40:12] do you see really how simple the last
[40:16] three feasts are you assemble together
[40:20] a message goes forth they reveal what
[40:23] stick it's revealed to them wants to
[40:25] tell my Ezreal now it's revealed who
[40:28] they crucified who what's going on now
[40:30] that God has paid the price for them and
[40:32] then the feast of tabernacles
[40:36] but what about us so let's just read
[40:40] Acts chapter 1 verse 6 to 11 when they
[40:43] therefore were coming together they
[40:44] asked of him saying Lord wilt thou at
[40:46] this time restore again the kingdom to
[40:47] Israel and he said unto them it is not
[40:50] for you to know the times or the seasons
[40:51] which the father had put in his power
[40:53] but ye shall receive power after that
[40:56] the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you
[40:57] shall be witnesses unto me both in
[40:59] Jerusalem and in all Judea and in
[41:01] Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of
[41:02] the earth and when he had spoken these
[41:04] things while they beheld he was taken up
[41:06] and a cloud received him out of their
[41:08] sight a cloud received him out of their
[41:09] sight so if he went up in a cloud he's
[41:12] gonna come back in a cloud right he's
[41:15] gonna and when does he come back he's
[41:17] revealed on the Day of Atonement because
[41:19] the high priest comes forth on the day
[41:20] of atonement I'm jumping ahead a little
[41:27] bit but hang on and when he had spoken
[41:30] these things while they beheld he was
[41:32] taken up and a cloud received him out of
[41:34] their sight and while they looked
[41:35] steadfastly toward heaven as he went up
[41:36] behold two men stood by them in white
[41:39] apparel which also said you men of
[41:41] Galilee why stand ye gazing up into
[41:43] heaven this same Jesus which is taken up
[41:46] from you into heaven shall so come in
[41:49] like manner as ye have seen him go into
[41:51] heaven but what's he doing now while
[41:55] he's in heaven Paul told us what he was
[41:57] doing he's doing the work of the high
[41:59] priest he's doing the mediatorial work
[42:02] of a high priest when you when you plead
[42:04] for mercy o God plead it based upon the
[42:06] word and he intercedes for you on your
[42:08] behalf a high priestess touched by the
[42:10] feelings of your infirmities that's able
[42:12] to be touched through the trials and the
[42:14] things that you go through in life
[42:16] through all these things but he's our
[42:18] high priest and that's why brother
[42:19] Branham preached the sermon who is this
[42:21] Melchizedek because when he came back on
[42:23] the scene he's a high priest after the
[42:26] order of Melchizedek and he preached him
[42:28] present tense because that high priest
[42:30] is present now
[42:32] priest he declared through that
[42:33] preaching of the word and he preached
[42:35] the words so that so that that high
[42:37] priest could come back not not in a he
[42:42] would come back in in a spiritual
[42:45] seventh month to you and I at the end of
[42:48] all of this thing at the end of all this
[42:50] process because it all started in the
[42:52] first month and it ends and the seventh
[42:55] month will say seventh because this
[42:58] reveals takes us on into the eighth
[42:59] because remember our seven feasts right
[43:02] but then at the end there's there's a
[43:04] holy convocation that takes you on into
[43:05] the eighth and so let's read let's just
[43:18] read some of these scriptures that Paul
[43:20] brought about about the high priest at
[43:21] Hebrews chapter 4 Hebrews chapter 4
[43:24] verse 14 he said seeing them that we
[43:26] have a great high priest that is passed
[43:29] into the heavens Jesus the Son of God
[43:31] let us hold fast our profession because
[43:35] what he's our high priest of our
[43:37] confession you see how important it is
[43:39] to have a confession not just upon some
[43:42] vague think that's why brother Graham
[43:43] said when you pray don't just let your
[43:45] mind go blank you've gotta have you
[43:47] gotta confess something and that thing
[43:48] that you confess is the Word of God and
[43:51] so the for the glory to come into your
[43:52] temple into your tabernacle you hear the
[43:54] word and then you confess that you speak
[43:56] it you go forward just like David did
[43:58] when he met Goliath he said I'm gonna
[44:00] cut your head off and all that all the
[44:01] different declarations he made for we
[44:03] have not an High Priest which cannot be
[44:05] touched with the feeling of our
[44:06] infirmities but was in all points
[44:08] tempted like as we are yet without
[44:10] seeing let us therefore come boldly into
[44:13] the throne of grace that we may obtain
[44:15] mercy and find grace to help in time of
[44:17] need and in Hebrews chapter 9 he said
[44:21] but Christ being coming high priest of
[44:23] good things to come by a greater and
[44:25] more perfect Tabernacle not made with
[44:28] hands that is to say not of this
[44:30] building neither by the blood of goats
[44:32] and calves but by his own blood he
[44:34] entered in once into the holy place
[44:36] having obtained eternal redemption for a
[44:39] seat there there's the answer
[44:41] where did he
[44:42] oh he entered in once into the holy
[44:44] place entered into the holy place to not
[44:47] not as though he's sitting up there just
[44:49] kind of relaxing somewhere or whatever
[44:51] but he's doing something he's pretty
[44:53] he's performing a mediatorial work for
[44:55] you until he comes back on the scene in
[44:57] this day that's why I believe that the
[45:00] fivefold ministry will assent to
[45:02] identify the day in the hour that we're
[45:04] living in what God is doing he identify
[45:07] the bride and I want to identify the
[45:09] night that this is the day that the high
[45:11] priest is being made manifested this is
[45:13] the day that Melchizedek is back on the
[45:15] scene he's come forth in the cloud of
[45:17] glory with clothed with a rainbow with
[45:20] his feet of brass and all that
[45:21] everything with a book at his hand a
[45:23] book that you can take and read and open
[45:25] up and see your place in the mystery and
[45:28] identify yourself with the mystery do
[45:31] you see how the bride the bride is
[45:33] because she is the voice in this day she
[45:36] is the final voice under her messenger
[45:38] she is able to identify who she is
[45:41] she is able to identify who the bride is
[45:43] and connect all the dots and see the
[45:46] whole picture if you see and this is in
[45:49] this day and this hour they say it's
[45:51] like the preaching of the gospel becomes
[45:53] greater than it ever has that's why the
[45:55] preaching of the gospel is the highest
[45:56] form of worship because the preaching of
[45:58] the gospel identifies what's taking
[46:00] place this got smells so good and
[46:08] they're good oh how could you fall
[46:12] asleep with something like this come on
[46:13] now neither by the blood of goats and
[46:16] cows let's see forth the blood of bulls
[46:18] and of goats and the ashes of a heifer
[46:20] sprinkling the unclean sanctifies to the
[46:23] purifying of the flesh how much more
[46:25] shall the blood of Christ who through
[46:28] tonight seat now he's talking about the
[46:29] day of atonement when you recognize that
[46:32] his blood has paid the price for you and
[46:35] made you entire taking you to a higher
[46:38] realm of justification taking you to a
[46:41] higher realm where all is all passed
[46:44] away do you see how much more shall the
[46:48] blood of Christ who through the Eternal
[46:49] Spirit offered himself without spot to
[46:51] God
[46:53] urge your conscience from dead works to
[46:55] serve the Living God and for this cause
[46:57] he is the mediator of the New Testament
[46:59] that by means of death for the
[47:01] redemption of the transgressions that
[47:03] were under the first Testament they
[47:05] which are called might receive the
[47:07] promise of eternal inheritance now see
[47:11] you see we're following a process
[47:14] because it takes a process to get to the
[47:17] return of the glory to get to a place
[47:19] where the glory returns is just like it
[47:22] was when Jesus himself I'm talking about
[47:24] that son of man glory when the Son of
[47:26] man went into the tabernacle veiled it
[47:29] was that glory was veiled behind him his
[47:31] flesh that's the glory I'm talking about
[47:33] the glory where he's taking us back to
[47:36] that same kind of glory the son of man
[47:38] walking and talking in this age but it
[47:43] takes a process remember the last time I
[47:46] was preaching about how Joseph went
[47:48] through a process and went through where
[47:50] they threw him into him after he got
[47:51] that robe of righteousness after you got
[47:53] that robe of the new birth from the
[47:55] father then he went through this process
[47:57] where he got thrown in a pit then he
[47:59] come out then he got tempted then he got
[48:01] thrown into prison there was a thief on
[48:03] the right and a thief on the left just
[48:04] like Jesus one on the right one on the
[48:07] left one that died went went to hell
[48:09] when they went to figuratively speaking
[48:11] one two went to heaven then he got
[48:13] pulled out of prison and there he was
[48:15] calling he got the the the signet on his
[48:20] finger and he got put on the throne and
[48:22] then he called a Gentile bride and and
[48:24] he and then he then he began to gather
[48:27] his brethren back to him that's the
[48:29] Feast of the trumpets and then they
[48:31] recognized who he was that's the Day of
[48:33] Atonement and then they relived and
[48:35] reigned in the Millennium then they're
[48:37] in and what became Goshen there and
[48:39] that's the Feast of Tabernacles and all
[48:42] of these things were played out and the
[48:43] life of Joseph and you could see it's a
[48:45] process it's a process just like when
[48:47] Eliezer went to call went to call
[48:49] Rebecca he went in and he went searching
[48:51] for where is she
[48:52] brother Branham preaching in all these
[48:53] different churches there might be just
[48:55] one in this church and he went preaching
[48:57] here and preaching there and till
[48:58] finally a little people began to the big
[49:01] fish the big rainbow trout began to buy
[49:03] it by to the hook and they be
[49:05] to follow after the message then I begin
[49:07] to see something was taking place and
[49:09] finally Rebecca she got on the camels
[49:12] and she began to come back and then then
[49:14] she went into Isaac's tent and and and
[49:16] that and see it's all a process to get
[49:18] from from glory under glory but see this
[49:21] process that I'm talking about
[49:24] one two three four feet then the Sherpa
[49:28] seven church aid has happened but in
[49:30] this seventh month and the seventh month
[49:33] it's time for the glory to return how
[49:35] does the glory return like I'm trying to
[49:39] figure out how to wind down here to say
[49:45] how does the glory return
[49:48] now if the Feast of Trumpets is to call
[49:51] Israel back and like brother Bremen said
[49:54] between the sixth and the seventh
[49:56] trumpet there's got to be a bride that
[49:59] comes something mysterious happen
[50:01] something's happening see it just says
[50:03] the Feast of the trumpets is calling
[50:05] Israel back to their homeland parallel
[50:07] to that there's also something that's
[50:09] corresponds to that happening with the
[50:12] bride and what's taking place is that
[50:14] God is sinning he sent a message to call
[50:16] us out he sent us out because see that's
[50:19] the parallel to these last three things
[50:21] it's first Thessalonians with it says
[50:23] that the Lord Himself will descend with
[50:26] a shout a message to gather the people
[50:29] back together a message to gather them
[50:32] back to the word and then avoid the
[50:35] voice of the Archangel si see how that
[50:38] parallel it parallels the day of
[50:40] atonement because the voice is when the
[50:42] people that heard the shout begin to
[50:44] recognize what that message is for they
[50:47] begin to recognize why God sent a
[50:50] prophet they begin to recognize who they
[50:52] are and they begin to realize what the
[50:56] day and the hour that they're living in
[50:57] is and then because they have heard the
[50:59] shout then they become the voice that
[51:03] will call the dead from the ground I
[51:05] hope I'm not blowing anybody's mind here
[51:08] and see when they when they become the
[51:11] voice when they become the voice then
[51:13] that pave is a way there is no inhibitor
[51:16] when the with
[51:18] force of the Archangel will cause the
[51:21] dead to rise from the ground because the
[51:23] word comes to the word and then the only
[51:26] thing left to happen is the Feast of
[51:28] Tabernacles which is the change of your
[51:30] dwelling place but you see you've got to
[51:32] get this all in order for the first
[51:34] there has to be a gathering together
[51:36] then you've got to put the ark into the
[51:38] tabernacle and then the glory can come
[51:41] so first that's why we had to hear a
[51:43] message that's why we had to hear a
[51:45] message that that gathered us together
[51:47] and it's gathering us together even
[51:49] though we're scattered all around the
[51:51] world there may be one or two in
[51:53] different churches scattered all all
[51:55] over the place
[51:58] let's read let's read Ruth chapter 1 you
[52:05] see you begin to see why brother Graham
[52:08] said when the seals open up you can take
[52:11] each seal and run it all the way through
[52:14] the Bible because this process is
[52:16] repeated in mystery form through all of
[52:20] these stories that you read this story
[52:22] of Esther the story of Esther is a story
[52:25] about how this little woman came into
[52:29] Authority and to into a touch she went
[52:31] into the King's it into the King and God
[52:33] authority to deliver the children of
[52:35] Israel the story of Ruth is a story of
[52:38] Naomi and Ruth being redeemed taking a
[52:40] bit taken back and you Ruth you know
[52:43] let's read it
[52:44] I'm gonna go down a rabbit trail Ruth
[52:48] chapter 1 verse 1 now it came to pass it
[52:52] came to pass in the days when the judges
[52:53] ruled it was a famine in the land just
[52:58] like today there's a family for the
[52:59] hearing of the word oh you better
[53:02] believe it
[53:04] that's what we tell our kids we one day
[53:07] you'll be able to choose your church and
[53:09] you better you better take careful
[53:12] consideration of what you do where were
[53:15] you where you set up shop and a certain
[53:18] man of Bethlehem Judah went to sojourn
[53:20] in the country of Moab he and his wife
[53:22] and his two sons and the name of the man
[53:24] was a limb Lac and the name of his wife
[53:26] Naomi and the name of his two sons Malin
[53:29] and Chile on better effort ice of
[53:31] Bethlehem
[53:31] Judith Marlin means sickness and chilly
[53:35] on means something like that so they
[53:37] right off the bat they they were having
[53:40] problems and they came into the country
[53:42] of Moab and continued there and
[53:43] eliminating Naomi's husband died and she
[53:45] was left and her two sons and they took
[53:48] them wives of the women of Moab the name
[53:50] of the one was or purring the name of
[53:51] the other Ruth and they dwell there
[53:52] about ten years and Marlon and Chilian
[53:55] died also both of them and the woman was
[53:56] left of her two sons and her husband and
[53:58] see see they they went out into the land
[54:01] of Moab and and and Elimelech and both
[54:03] sons died but that didn't get him moving
[54:06] back to the homeland look and see what
[54:08] I'm talking about is being gathered back
[54:10] to the word what got them moving was not
[54:14] these three people dying they still sit
[54:16] there but what got a moving let's read
[54:18] the next verse then she arose with her
[54:20] daughters-in-law that she might return
[54:22] from the country of Moab for she had
[54:24] heard and the country of Moab how that
[54:27] the Lord had visited his people and
[54:29] giving them bread and giving them and
[54:33] that's that's why all of us are gathered
[54:35] here today all of us are gathered here
[54:36] because we've been attracted to this
[54:39] location because of the message of the
[54:41] hours being preached from all over the
[54:43] earth we're being attracted to the word
[54:45] we're being gathered to the word and the
[54:47] word is what gathered us together let me
[54:51] see let me see if I can kind of skip
[54:53] over some of this here because see
[54:55] brother Branham when he began to preach
[54:57] he was preaching together he was
[54:59] gathering the bride up into a bride for
[55:01] him because back in 1962 I love this
[55:04] quote where he said in the endtime seed
[55:06] sign he said this was when he was
[55:09] sharing that five stars had lined up and
[55:11] really really what it was if you look at
[55:13] look back in the history it was the five
[55:15] planets plus the Sun and the moon which
[55:19] made seven stars had all lined up and he
[55:21] said that was a sign in the heaven that
[55:24] showed that something was taking place
[55:25] an infant bride was being formed what
[55:28] was she being formed around she was
[55:30] being formed around the word that she
[55:31] was eating in preparation for that glory
[55:34] to fall upon her he said an infant
[55:37] Church a bride emphysema the power of
[55:40] God had began to fall on her she's
[55:41] taking for him a bride for this
[55:43] bridegroom that three star
[55:45] his perfection of the heavenly father's
[55:47] of the Trinity becoming one on earth
[55:49] among us God's officers becoming one
[55:52] office what happened now it's the Church
[55:54] of the Living God coming together under
[55:56] the Word of God and the astronomic
[55:58] heaven is announcing her approach a man
[56:00] might not believe that but it's the word
[56:02] just the same though the bride was being
[56:05] formed around that she was gathered
[56:07] together coming into a realization just
[56:11] as the just as Israel was being gathered
[56:14] back into their homeland and you know
[56:16] you start to wonder Oh what what are the
[56:18] seven trumpets well you go and and you
[56:21] know we don't have time to take an
[56:23] in-depth study or anything or look at
[56:24] the examples of things but there's I
[56:26] believe it was the fifth trumpet that
[56:28] the earth and the the grass and all the
[56:30] different things were scorched that all
[56:32] the different things of the earth were
[56:34] scorched and I remember brother I think
[56:36] it was brother Brown I'm talking about
[56:37] how that he knew somebody that fought in
[56:39] war with one or one of the one of the
[56:41] world wars and they said I looked
[56:43] everywhere and I could see and and the
[56:45] grass was scorched it looked like the
[56:46] sky was scorched there was no bark on
[56:48] the trees everything was scorched and
[56:50] and see what were those things done for
[56:52] to drive the Israelites that all the
[56:55] persecution of Hitler and and and and
[56:58] Mussolini and all that stuff going on to
[57:01] get them back into their homeland so you
[57:04] see what day and our living in Israel is
[57:06] back in their homeland and the bride is
[57:09] back in their homeland
[57:11] - what's the bride's homeland the
[57:12] bride's Promised Land is the word of the
[57:15] hour that's why just just like any
[57:18] Israelite that is out of their homeland
[57:20] is out of the blessing of God just like
[57:22] any any member of the bride any church
[57:24] member that's out of the promises of God
[57:26] out of the Holy Ghost in power is
[57:28] outside of the will of God and then we
[57:32] come to the day of Tommen which to the
[57:38] Jews I'm closing down here a little bit
[57:41] don't get nervous on me which of the
[57:45] Jews is when they recognize when they
[57:48] recognize that the sacrifice has already
[57:50] been paid what you think about and I'm
[57:52] just kind of getting to steal here a
[57:53] little bit what the day of
[57:54] was the Day of Atonement is when the
[57:56] high priest goes into the sanctuary and
[57:59] and sprinkles on the altar the seven
[58:01] seven times that the the blood of the
[58:04] sacrifice that he's made
[58:05] you've got the scapegoat remember the
[58:07] scapegoat that that was released into
[58:09] the wilderness and took took our sins
[58:11] far far away and that's the type of they
[58:14] realized that the atonement has already
[58:16] been made for what do you what do you
[58:19] realize that if you're looking at the
[58:21] atonement when when the high priest is
[58:24] comes forth from the sanctuary the high
[58:27] priests coming forth as the Son of Man
[58:29] coming forth with his feet of brass with
[58:32] the book in his hand with with his feet
[58:33] one foot on the land and one foot on the
[58:35] sea having complete power and Dominion
[58:37] over civil and ecclesiastical powers
[58:39] having power over all these thing and he
[58:41] says there in Revelations yeah
[58:43] Revelation chapter 10 verse 8 he says
[58:46] John take the little book the angel said
[58:48] take the book he's got the book in his
[58:50] hand and he comes and he says take the
[58:52] book take the book so that you can see
[58:57] you can look and see that you're
[58:59] identified with him do you realize that
[59:01] remember when brother Branham was
[59:02] preaching birth pains and his pages got
[59:04] stuck together he's playing out a little
[59:06] symphony he's playing out and their acts
[59:09] of a play when his pages got stuck
[59:11] together and he was wondering what's
[59:12] going on here and and a priest came up
[59:15] to and said and handed him his Bible and
[59:17] said here just relax everything is done
[59:21] according to the word of the Lord
[59:22] everything that has done according to a
[59:25] purpose because he's acting out
[59:27] something he's acting out taking that
[59:29] book from the high priest he's acting it
[59:31] out and it's unfolding to see was you
[59:40] see all the things that go part of that
[59:43] Day of Atonement the high priest was the
[59:45] only one that could have access to that
[59:47] hidden manna but he's made us kings and
[59:50] priests he's made it he's given us the
[59:52] right and the authority to go into the
[59:54] interval and eat of that hidden manna
[59:57] that was only reserved for the high
[59:59] priest and nobody else could go at they
[1:00:03] the manor that was outside in the outer
[1:00:05] core they would gather that manner but
[1:00:06] the high priest had access to that
[1:00:09] hidden manna and now we've got access to
[1:00:12] the hidden manna that even-even down
[1:00:14] through the seven churches they didn't
[1:00:16] have access to they didn't know who is
[1:00:18] this Melchizedek they didn't know Christ
[1:00:20] is the mystery of God revealed they
[1:00:22] didn't know the future home of the
[1:00:24] heavenly bride and the earthly the
[1:00:26] future home of the heavenly Oh however
[1:00:29] that is the future home that it they
[1:00:33] didn't know all all of these things that
[1:00:36] have been preached to us because what
[1:00:38] did the message do the message declared
[1:00:40] that the Messiah is here that the son of
[1:00:43] man is here and he's here because he's
[1:00:46] stepped forth from the sanctuary they
[1:00:49] look for him back back there in this
[1:00:51] first church age at the beginning at
[1:00:52] very beginning when he went up and he
[1:00:54] was received into the cloud they look
[1:00:56] for him and they wondered where he went
[1:00:58] they wondered what was happened we not
[1:01:01] see him they could have seen him because
[1:01:03] he was he went behind the veil of the
[1:01:05] inner sanctuary but now he's come forth
[1:01:08] and he's been revealed to the bride many
[1:01:11] don't see him just like they didn't see
[1:01:13] back there in st. John because he was
[1:01:15] veiled to them even though he walked
[1:01:17] among I mean he talked among them but
[1:01:19] now he's veiled he's unveiled to us and
[1:01:22] the only thing left is for the Feast of
[1:01:24] Tabernacles
[1:01:30] I'll see I'm debating whether to get
[1:01:32] into the Golden Jubilee or not let me
[1:01:35] just touch on that real quick because in
[1:01:37] Leviticus it says that after seven seven
[1:01:41] seven seven times seven is forty-nine
[1:01:43] then you got I'm a backup Rundell here
[1:01:49] hey you don't need him backing up but
[1:01:51] I'm doing Leviticus 25 verse eight says
[1:01:55] in doubt number seven thousands of years
[1:01:58] under these seven times seven years and
[1:02:00] the space of the seven seven seven years
[1:02:02] shall be under the forty and nine years
[1:02:04] right here seven times seven is
[1:02:07] forty-nine but see that's when that day
[1:02:09] of atonement when the high priest comes
[1:02:11] out he comes out on the day of a
[1:02:13] homer and makes make a declaration what
[1:02:17] they that you everything can go free
[1:02:19] what's everything your soul and your
[1:02:22] spirit and your body and and the earth
[1:02:26] everything is going free nothing is
[1:02:29] gonna be held back then shout that calls
[1:02:31] the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on
[1:02:33] the tenth day of the seventh month and
[1:02:34] the day of atonement shall you make the
[1:02:37] trumpet sound throughout all your land
[1:02:38] and ye shall hallow the fiftieth year
[1:02:41] and proclaim Liberty throughout all the
[1:02:43] land unto all the inhabitants thereof it
[1:02:45] shall be a jubilee under you and you
[1:02:47] shall return every man unto his
[1:02:49] possession
[1:02:49] what's your possession back to the
[1:02:52] Father that he may be all and all back
[1:02:54] to him
[1:02:54] everything will be he will consume
[1:02:57] everything back to you back to your
[1:02:59] inheritance back to back to the dominion
[1:03:02] over the earth back to what was yours
[1:03:03] before Adam lost the right to it back to
[1:03:06] everything and that's what the golden
[1:03:08] jubilee is when that when the when the
[1:03:10] high priest steps out in that golden
[1:03:13] jubilee he declares that everything can
[1:03:16] go free I'm gonna read one more thing
[1:03:23] because now oh goodness y'all cuz now we
[1:03:31] come to the Feast of Tabernacles which
[1:03:34] also is in the seventh month
[1:03:37] let's read Nehemiah chapter 8 see this
[1:03:44] seventh month the things that happen in
[1:03:46] this seventh month the feasts the Feast
[1:03:48] of Trumpets the Day of Atonement Feast
[1:03:51] of Atonement and the Feast of
[1:03:53] Tabernacles are all very mysterious
[1:03:55] things because they're secret things
[1:03:58] secret
[1:04:03] let's read Nehemiah chapter 8 verses 1
[1:04:06] through 15 and then we'll be done and
[1:04:10] all the people gathered themselves
[1:04:11] here's another gathering all the people
[1:04:13] gathered themselves together is one man
[1:04:15] into the street that was before the
[1:04:17] water gate and they spake unto Ezra the
[1:04:20] scribe to bring the book of the law of
[1:04:23] Moses which the Lord had commanded to
[1:04:25] Israel so you've got a gathering
[1:04:27] together you've got the book in other
[1:04:31] words the Ten Commandments the
[1:04:33] revelation you've got the gathering
[1:04:36] you've got the book and the people are
[1:04:38] going to look in the book and then let's
[1:04:42] keep reading
[1:04:43] and Ezra the priest brought the law
[1:04:46] before the congregation both of men and
[1:04:48] women and all that could hear with
[1:04:50] understanding upon the first day of the
[1:04:53] seventh month the seventh month and he
[1:04:56] read therein before the street that was
[1:04:58] before the water gate from the morning
[1:05:00] until midday before the men and the
[1:05:01] women and those that could understand
[1:05:03] that the ears of all the people were
[1:05:06] attentive unto the book of the law see
[1:05:08] they were attentive back then there was
[1:05:10] so attendant they could sit through half
[1:05:12] of the day they didn't complain about
[1:05:13] you know 30 or 45 minute the church
[1:05:16] today you know we need to have this real
[1:05:18] short church services or anything that
[1:05:20] were ready to hear that book and Ezra
[1:05:23] the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood
[1:05:25] which they had made for the purpose and
[1:05:27] beside him stood mat Athiya and she my
[1:05:30] and I'm not gonna read all these names
[1:05:31] verse five and Ezra opened the book and
[1:05:34] the sight of all the people he opened up
[1:05:37] the book for he was above all the people
[1:05:40] and when he opened it all the people
[1:05:42] stood up and Ezra blessed the Lord the
[1:05:45] Great God and all the people answered
[1:05:46] amen amen with lifting up their hands
[1:05:48] and they bow their hands heads and
[1:05:50] worship the Lord with their faces to the
[1:05:51] ground and and a lot of more names and
[1:05:55] the Levites calls the people to
[1:05:57] understand the law and that people stood
[1:05:59] in their place oh my there's a lot we
[1:06:02] could say about the fivefold ministry
[1:06:03] here they cause the people to understand
[1:06:05] the law so they read in the book and the
[1:06:07] law of God distinctly and gave the sins
[1:06:10] and calls them to understand the reading
[1:06:13] it calls them to understand
[1:06:15] what they were reading just like I'm
[1:06:18] doing right now look how simple these
[1:06:21] seven feasts are to understand they show
[1:06:23] the day and the hour that we're living
[1:06:25] in and this is what was happening here
[1:06:27] in this chapter they began to realize
[1:06:29] the day and the hour that they were
[1:06:31] living in and they began as we read
[1:06:33] along I'm just gonna distill it real
[1:06:35] quick for you they begin to realize that
[1:06:37] they had never they had not cept
[1:06:39] celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles in a
[1:06:42] long time that it had not been
[1:06:44] celebrated and for such a sister
[1:06:46] duration and so let's keep reading in
[1:06:49] verse 9 he said in Nehemiah which is the
[1:06:51] true Shafa the governor and Ezra the
[1:06:53] priest described in the Levi's taught
[1:06:55] that taught the people and all the
[1:06:56] people this day is holy under the Lord
[1:06:59] your God more not nor weep for all the
[1:07:04] people wept when they heard the words of
[1:07:06] the law then he said unto them go your
[1:07:09] way eat the fat and drink the sweet and
[1:07:12] send Portia's unto them for whom nothing
[1:07:13] is prepared for this day is holy unto
[1:07:16] our Lord and neither be sorry for the
[1:07:18] joy of the Lord is your strength
[1:07:19] so the Levites stilled all the people
[1:07:22] saying hold your peace for the day is
[1:07:24] holy neither be aggrieved and all their
[1:07:26] people went their way to eat at the
[1:07:28] drink and to send portions and portions
[1:07:30] and then make great great mirth because
[1:07:33] they had understood the words that were
[1:07:35] declared under them do you see what
[1:07:38] brings is a revival it's not just having
[1:07:41] the spirit in the church but it's having
[1:07:44] the words and having an understanding of
[1:07:46] what's taking place that's what and we
[1:07:49] we have the recipe for a revival today a
[1:07:53] word revival a bride the bride is having
[1:07:56] a word revival now and on the second day
[1:08:00] we're gathered together the chief of the
[1:08:02] fathers of all the people the priests
[1:08:04] and the Levites unto Ezra the scribe
[1:08:05] even to understand the words of the law
[1:08:08] and they found written in the law which
[1:08:10] the Lord had commanded my Moses that the
[1:08:13] children of Israel should dwell in
[1:08:15] booths and the feasts of the seventh
[1:08:16] month in other words they looked into
[1:08:19] the law they recognized and they began
[1:08:22] to understand what was taking place and
[1:08:24] they realized that the Bible said that
[1:08:27] there was going to be a body change the
[1:08:29] Bible said
[1:08:30] in first corinthians chapter 15 where it
[1:08:32] says behold I show you a mystery we
[1:08:34] shall not all sleep but we shall all be
[1:08:37] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[1:08:39] an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet
[1:08:42] shall sound and the dead shall be raised
[1:08:45] incorruptible and we shall be changed
[1:08:47] they looked into the book and realized
[1:08:50] that there was a mystery of a body
[1:08:52] changed like Paul preached to the
[1:08:54] Thessalonians for the Lord himself shall
[1:08:56] descend from heaven verse 15 first that
[1:09:01] we would see alive and remain unto the
[1:09:03] coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[1:09:04] them which are asleep for the Lord
[1:09:07] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:09:09] shout with the voice of the Archangel
[1:09:12] and with the Trump of God and the dead
[1:09:14] in Christ shall rise first then we which
[1:09:17] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[1:09:19] together with them in the clouds to meet
[1:09:21] the lord in the air and so shall we ever
[1:09:23] be with the Lord and as the musicians
[1:09:25] come I'm just wrapping this up here if
[1:09:27] you see they caught the revelation of
[1:09:30] the day in the hour that they were
[1:09:31] living in and then they they began to
[1:09:33] build booths for themselves they began
[1:09:35] to go they took that revelation and they
[1:09:37] began to do something with it they began
[1:09:39] to exercise their faith but do you see
[1:09:41] how the shout and the voice and the
[1:09:44] Trump parallels what's happening here in
[1:09:47] these last three feasts the shout and
[1:09:49] the voice in that shout the voice in the
[1:09:51] Trump was given for you just as these
[1:09:54] three feasts were given to Israel to
[1:09:56] gather you back together to reveal to
[1:09:59] you who you are to call the dead from
[1:10:01] the graves and then to change your
[1:10:04] mortal body amen if you can stand now
[1:10:09] and we'll just I'm gonna I'm gonna end
[1:10:12] right there
[1:10:12] I know I come to a screeching halt
[1:10:14] sometime God is good at any Amen coming
[1:10:26] down on the Word of God
