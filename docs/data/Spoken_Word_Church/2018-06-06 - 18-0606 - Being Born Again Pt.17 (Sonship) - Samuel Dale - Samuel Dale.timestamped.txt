[4:20] tonight by thy grace and let your light
[4:22] shine to each and every one of us in
[4:25] Jesus name Amen
[4:27] [Music]
[4:29] we went from or we've been reading we'll
[4:33] go to verse 22 and 23 a first Peter
[4:39] seeing you have purified your souls and
[4:42] obeying the truth through the spirit
[4:43] unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see
[4:46] that you love one another that you love
[4:49] one another with a pure heart fervently
[4:51] being born again something's taking
[4:54] place it's in a changing period of
[4:57] things not not off corruptible seed now
[5:01] what's the point being born again not of
[5:04] corruptible it's not something that's
[5:05] corruptible
[5:06] its incorruptible it's the Word of God
[5:11] alright now that's what the scripture
[5:13] says so then we know what the new birth
[5:15] is what the birth of the word right
[5:19] because it's the only thing that's
[5:21] incorruptible now the alive word is what
[5:23] you're talking about
[5:24] you know I talking about dead letter
[5:26] dead letters on the page is corruptible
[5:28] just like anything else you know like
[5:31] that but but revealed word is where
[5:33] we're at which liveth and abideth
[5:34] forever okay now let's go over to if we
[5:37] can get to it tonight and pick up our
[5:39] thought from Galatians 4 what we're
[5:46] going to try to do tonight is as much as
[5:49] possible try to tie together I mentioned
[5:52] it coming through in the series that
[5:54] we've been on but I want you to think
[5:57] about Peter in second Peter talking
[6:03] about the virtues the divine nature of
[6:05] God the things like that explaining that
[6:10] that was what we need to grow into Paul
[6:14] takes it from the adoption of situation
[6:17] are the explaining it from a child being
[6:21] born and growing up all right but both
[6:24] of them are explaining the same thing
[6:27] which is the growth development of a
[6:30] Christian all right now that's that's
[6:33] our thought so get that in your mind and
[6:36] then you can read the Bible and see you
[6:39] can read Peter and say hey I can see
[6:42] that that's that's a growth development
[6:44] then you turn over and Paul and go into
[6:48] wages in Romans you can see it through
[6:50] the eye you see it through all specialty
[6:52] relations and Ephesians that you can see
[6:56] the growth growth development of a
[6:58] Christian and that's what we're talking
[7:00] about right all right now so look what
[7:03] he says verse 1 now I say that the heir
[7:08] as long he isn't as he is a child
[7:11] differeth nothing from a servant though
[7:15] he be Lord of all know what he's under
[7:18] tutors and governors until the time
[7:22] appointed of the Father even so we now
[7:27] he's this is the natural story as we'll
[7:30] get to it in a minute what a child when
[7:32] it's born into the family it's just as
[7:34] much as house it'll ever be he doesn't
[7:37] become a
[7:39] adoption is not your birth adoption is
[7:43] your placing in your birth all right so
[7:47] then that's what he's saying now he
[7:49] comes from the natural story and he said
[7:53] even so we when we were children in
[7:56] bondage under the elements of the world
[7:58] he's not talking about the natural I'll
[8:00] go back through this to me he's not
[8:02] talking about the natural life he's
[8:04] talking about the spiritual right but
[8:07] when the fullness of the time was come
[8:09] God sent forth his son made of a woman
[8:11] made under the law what far why or what
[8:16] far to redeem them that were under the
[8:19] law that we might receive the adoption
[8:22] of sons and because your sons God has
[8:26] sent forth the spirit of his son into
[8:27] your hearts crying Abba Father wherefore
[8:31] there are no more a servant you're not
[8:34] just a servant now but a son and if a
[8:38] son then an heir of God through Christ
[8:41] Jesus amen you may be seated the Lord
[8:45] that is blessing to the reading of the
[8:48] word okay father's day sheets sign up
[8:55] downstairs on the refrigerator if you're
[8:58] going to the Father's Day outing let us
[9:01] know where we can have ever nothing and
[9:03] make sure we get enough food and etc and
[9:06] all looking forward to a good time to
[9:09] where it would be more of of inward it
[9:13] won't be having to fight the bugs and
[9:14] the snakes and the and the what do you
[9:20] the thing that they were hunting that
[9:23] the things they were hunting up there
[9:26] you remember Bigfoot it was no joke we
[9:32] came back you thought was telling a joke
[9:34] but I mean they had people from all over
[9:36] the United States looking for Bigfoot
[9:43] we tried our best to tell them he was
[9:45] with us and Aaron was there with us but
[9:49] they were an Anderson and you know he
[9:52] fit in that category that we had Bigfoot
[9:55] but they wouldn't that wouldn't exactly
[9:58] what now I'm talking right now see you
[10:02] life at these things we did but I mean
[10:04] when you see cars drive by this Michigan
[10:06] New York Washington and come to find out
[10:10] there was a group of above us that was
[10:12] in an area that they had rented to where
[10:16] they could camp and research these
[10:19] things all right now listen
[10:21] it cost us twelve dollars and nine
[10:23] that's what we pay for a not at that
[10:26] camping area all right that's one
[10:28] campsite there's twelve dollars they
[10:31] were paying $400 per campsite and I know
[10:40] they had five or six up her but they
[10:43] were playing four hundred dollars
[10:45] because the government would not allow
[10:47] them to come in and look for Bigfoot
[10:49] without paying the big prize they they
[10:53] the Bigfoot okay buddy I might we'll
[10:56] find out we don't get no Bigfoot up
[10:57] there and we'll be sitting inside of
[11:01] teepees you know in having a good time
[11:04] okay now so I thought tonight we want to
[11:08] get into it we've been covering the
[11:12] statue of a perfect man from second
[11:15] Peter all right and we've covered that
[11:18] up to the bases and if you'll if you've
[11:20] noticed it we got just to the new birth
[11:23] and we stopped we mentioned the virtue
[11:27] and you know but now we've dropped over
[11:30] from taking the point of the statue of a
[11:34] perfect man from Peter now we're going
[11:37] to Paul and his account of the Christian
[11:42] development and he's going to approach
[11:45] it from the adoption or situation
[11:48] alright so then all of your your
[11:51] router's Peter Peter and Paul is a basic
[11:54] Paul we know wrote most of them but
[11:55] Peter put it in our telling us about the
[11:59] things of Christianity and how to become
[12:02] to the
[12:02] place of a statue of a perfect man all
[12:05] right now and what he was doing he was
[12:08] telling it as what was our point what
[12:14] has been the point through the statue of
[12:15] perfect man the statue of a perfect man
[12:18] that the second Peter is not written to
[12:21] the world it's written to those that are
[12:24] in Christ Jesus I tried to get you to
[12:27] see then really the entire Bible is
[12:30] written to the Christian the sinner he
[12:33] can only realize he's a sinner from that
[12:37] word of God being brought and talk to
[12:39] him about it
[12:40] it's written to those that are in Christ
[12:42] Jesus and then the Bible says no man can
[12:44] call Jesus the Christ right and said
[12:48] except it be by the baptism of the Holy
[12:50] Ghost the new birth all right so then
[12:54] the Bible is written to Christians and
[12:56] Peter was telling them how to become
[12:59] partakers of the divine nature remember
[13:03] that in Peter the divine nature which is
[13:06] the nature of Almighty God we're going
[13:08] to get to this is--we're maybe Sunday
[13:10] but see those virtues are a protector of
[13:13] his nature
[13:15] that's why we wrote about him he'll talk
[13:17] about virtues he doesn't just use one
[13:20] virtue and Express a point he calls all
[13:24] of those things knowledge temperance now
[13:27] he calls them virtues he calls them the
[13:30] qualities of God all right so then
[13:34] that's what we are to develop in the
[13:36] Christian life and remember as we ended
[13:39] up the message there the other day we
[13:42] ended up talking about where the Prophet
[13:45] was covering from the stature of a
[13:47] perfect man how that these seven virtues
[13:53] relating with the ages the brains the
[13:57] ages up you know all right
[13:59] then he brings the individual up and he
[14:02] says the ages and the individual come
[14:05] the same all right it's one on the other
[14:07] one only other one owner don't try to
[14:09] run up and get up way up above just let
[14:12] it go and let God bring it to you cause
[14:15] we're
[14:16] now brother branham say it I emphasize
[14:19] this over and over he says these things
[14:21] once you are born again now you remember
[14:26] these once you're born again you born
[14:29] yet in fact he said then these are the
[14:30] things that God expects us to add right
[14:35] now and he said don't worry about it the
[14:41] come on see I'm trying to bring up a
[14:45] wedge that's so hard until I don't want
[14:49] you to lean in too much backward but I
[14:52] don't want us to fall over this way too
[14:54] far
[14:55] all right see looking at those virtues
[14:59] the Prophet said don't worry about it
[15:02] they'll be automatically added no that's
[15:07] his words you read the book at least
[15:10] you're supposed to or listen to the tape
[15:12] all right anything yes we got down to
[15:15] the last of it paragraph 354 and on down
[15:18] through there a statue of a perfect man
[15:20] where he says now these ages brings up
[15:24] the church you know all right you come
[15:27] up the church emphasis somewhere in the
[15:29] Ferguson law they do see it all right
[15:31] he said that brings the church to the
[15:34] position of a rapture to be able to be
[15:38] made manifest all right now then he says
[15:42] and then this is the church see the
[15:46] individuals then come up through the
[15:51] ages you know the individuals come up
[15:56] through the ages to come forth to her
[15:59] that will be manifesting to in this age
[16:03] somebody will of a rapture to the church
[16:07] and it's these these things that brings
[16:11] us to that right circles we've got to
[16:13] come to the faith of the fathers you
[16:16] don't hear that taught in the message
[16:18] anymore when around us 1970 you kind of
[16:21] wish people were talking a little about
[16:23] faith the father's but now you hear no
[16:25] no where is such a great revelation
[16:27] deal where you know well that's all
[16:30] right but listen Church the Prophet is
[16:35] one that said it
[16:36] the Bible is the one it declared it you
[16:40] understand what I'm making the point
[16:41] hard and strong the Prophet declared
[16:44] melikhaya for to be the point of turning
[16:49] the hearts of the children back to the
[16:52] faith of the father
[16:53] all right and it be these divinely
[16:56] revealed mystery truths of the seven
[16:59] thunders he said 327 Church age book
[17:02] this messenger Malachi 4 luke 1730
[17:05] revelation 10 7 in other words it's
[17:07] gonna do two things turn the hearts of
[17:09] the children back to the face of the
[17:10] father he said and reveal the thunders
[17:12] which is revelations containing the
[17:14] seven seals and instead it be these
[17:16] divinely revealed mystery truths that
[17:18] literally turn us back alright so then
[17:21] if we ever expect to receive those
[17:23] virtues see then we must rely upon the
[17:28] prophets message of the studying of the
[17:32] message of the hour to let that message
[17:36] captivate us and because that will
[17:39] listen now what I'm saying that will let
[17:43] the Holy Spirit have something to make
[17:47] us grow thereby are you following me see
[17:54] then that way the Holy Spirit has
[17:55] something for you and I to grow by what
[17:57] the growth of the word God sent a
[18:00] prophet to make sure that would work he
[18:04] brought his message and delivered it now
[18:06] it's up to you and I because he said
[18:09] that that this ages this people the
[18:13] church ages and they would go in a
[18:14] rapture then he says the individuals by
[18:20] having these virtues will go into a
[18:22] rapture alright now we know that ever
[18:25] born-again believer goes in rapture but
[18:28] ever born again to believer won't stand
[18:30] there with the faith of the father's but
[18:32] yet they will be a group that does have
[18:34] the faith of the father's and that'll be
[18:37] what we're waiting on are crying out for
[18:39] for
[18:40] deliverance because of the message of
[18:43] the hour has the deliverance why
[18:46] wouldn't we want anything else
[18:48] well I I have to I just you know I'd
[18:52] like to uh to hear this brother I like
[18:55] to hear that brother well praise the
[18:56] Lord go hear him but then when they get
[18:59] off the word what are you gonna do and
[19:01] especially when you get caught with him
[19:05] you remember the little statement I made
[19:08] there Sunday about where the Prophet
[19:13] said awake thou that sleepless
[19:17] he said that was the bride in them
[19:19] denomination's well now do you think
[19:21] that's not tonight oh no that was way
[19:27] back yonder 4050 years ago that's true
[19:30] that's true but it's still here tonight
[19:33] oh no we're not in denominations lie
[19:40] brother Moute said he had a good point
[19:41] he said you've got your coat in your hat
[19:43] you changed meeting houses you know what
[19:46] that means is you hanging it up here and
[19:49] you go and you hang it up over there
[19:50] what's the difference you might as well
[19:53] left it hang it over there because if
[19:55] you're just gonna move to another meet
[19:57] in the house you see yeah well we don't
[19:59] have them denominational I did I'll
[20:03] quote you the Prophet if you want to go
[20:05] for a long ways with it remember but the
[20:10] rent said the Holy Ghost had been bound
[20:12] at the door our creeds and dogmas for
[20:17] 2,000 years now listen he said but to be
[20:21] loosed in the end time by this message
[20:25] the Holy Ghost can't be loosed until
[20:28] this message is brought into you and I I
[20:31] was running some quotes and I run across
[20:33] one and I just I start laughing and I
[20:37] just cut it out and I get to it in a
[20:39] minute but what was tickling me was that
[20:44] brother run said that's why we've been
[20:47] 40 years you know so he was back God
[20:54] forty years I started dying laughing I
[20:57] said why we've been here 40 years right
[21:03] why we've been here 40 50 years since
[21:06] the Prophet left the scene you know why
[21:08] for the same reason back God nobody
[21:12] wouldn't take in what the Prophet said
[21:14] they wouldn't believe in the Word of God
[21:16] oh yeah we're in the message we believe
[21:18] everything run around saying oh yeah
[21:20] yeah well just don't fool ourselves okay
[21:27] I mean fooling others is one time yeah
[21:31] but just remember don't try to fool
[21:33] yourself just be what you are and let
[21:38] Christianity dweller into you and let me
[21:41] get back to that point the word brother
[21:42] Bryan said don't worry about these
[21:44] virtues see it's not something to worry
[21:47] other than that sister in blasphemous
[21:51] name she was worried whether she had the
[21:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost or not well
[21:58] all of us should be worried about that
[22:00] no bless God I got it and if I say I
[22:03] ain't got it I mean God be lovely
[22:06] that's a good old Baptist statement I'll
[22:09] come up from that you know we can't deny
[22:11] the father
[22:12] you ain't never talked to a good Baptist
[22:14] about the Trinity and they say we can't
[22:17] deny the father because if we do now the
[22:19] father will deny the son so we got to
[22:22] believe that there's three of them you
[22:27] didn't talk to people but listen these
[22:33] things of prophets right if we make
[22:37] ourselves available to the message of
[22:41] the hour studying the message and
[22:43] everything it will automatically bring
[22:46] forth the things that it's promised the
[22:50] brain that's all I've ever tried to
[22:53] teach we try to figure this out try to
[22:58] figure this that well we got this
[22:59] brother went this way this brother went
[23:01] anyway but just be a Christian What did
[23:04] he say over this close to the life of
[23:06] this ebook not be in the seventh
[23:08] but he says going with a same simple
[23:12] message because if you don't you work
[23:15] yourself away from it well what's the
[23:19] same simple message it's a heart halfway
[23:23] could come up preaching the seals and
[23:26] he's preaching justification same casing
[23:27] the baptism with holy goes from the
[23:32] seals wouldn't that be the same simple
[23:36] message would not it be the fact of
[23:40] trying to understand what the new Burke
[23:42] really is and what it's to do it what do
[23:48] you see what I'm talking about see then
[23:50] they'll be automatically added when we
[23:53] lay ourselves available and what did the
[23:55] prophet said you know at one time you
[23:58] know we talked about we need different
[23:59] he said we're just too full you've been
[24:01] with that one we're just too full what
[24:05] we're full of ourselves we ain't too
[24:08] full of God no we're too full of
[24:10] ourselves that's what we need to do is
[24:13] get rid of ourselves and get into him
[24:14] alright what you see there the statute
[24:17] of perfect man then is to tell us that
[24:21] we must have those virtues if we're
[24:23] going to come to a change of the body
[24:25] now if not you're going by the grave
[24:28] that's that's what people they just you
[24:31] can misunderstand me you make me say
[24:33] things that I have no way of saying it
[24:37] and they're in no way did I say it but
[24:40] yet you make me say things because you
[24:43] think you understand what I'm talking
[24:45] about
[24:49] if it takes these virtues to come to a
[24:53] change of the body as your prophet said
[24:56] in the statue of a perfect man then it's
[25:02] going to take the verses it's like we
[25:07] need to know how to get the virtue
[25:11] milk out for Luke 17 there in Revelation
[25:13] 10 7 tells us how to get to virtues what
[25:16] by following the message and believing
[25:19] the message and walking into the man
[25:21] and making ourselves available it's not
[25:24] something that's and it's not an
[25:27] automatic willful it's automatic I don't
[25:29] have to do nothing now that's the wrong
[25:30] approach to automatic that's not what
[25:34] he's talking about right well I don't
[25:37] have to do nothing cause it's
[25:38] automatically added you got to be born
[25:39] again and you got to make yourself
[25:41] available then he can take care of
[25:45] things all right now in doing it that
[25:48] way then see we can come to a place of
[25:50] seeing that the Bible is trying to
[25:53] express all the way through to show us
[25:57] in types and shatters from the Old
[25:58] Testament because he Peters over here
[26:03] he's speaking of the statute of perfect
[26:05] land he's speaking that we are of this
[26:08] group of people that have escaped this
[26:10] corruption that is in the world through
[26:12] lust and we've become born again and
[26:15] were born again by faith in God oona
[26:19] Peter is explaining what we're coming to
[26:22] the new birth brings us to that part
[26:25] because the new birth is us covering
[26:27] Sunday the new birth is not a Naiad you
[26:33] don't add the new birth you've got a
[26:35] house something to add the virtuous to
[26:38] alright so the new birth is a birth you
[26:42] don't have the baby right the baby comes
[26:48] out a mattock all right see then that's
[26:51] where we come in to that place of sin
[26:55] Peter's explaining the virtues of what
[26:58] it takes in this to bring us to a place
[27:00] Paul goes all the way back into the Old
[27:03] Testament he takes all of the types in
[27:05] the shadows of the Old Testament and he
[27:08] brings it down to the what would be
[27:11] called the adoption all stages all right
[27:15] and as he's explaining it he's
[27:18] explaining in here in Galatians that an
[27:22] heir even though he's an error even
[27:27] though he's born in the family that he
[27:31] has nothing of his own at that time
[27:35] even though he owns all things he will
[27:40] eventually come out to own the whole
[27:42] things but yet he starts out as a baby
[27:44] and Paul's explaining said he's under
[27:48] tutors and governors until the time
[27:52] appointed
[27:55] see because then that puts him as a
[27:57] child but let's read something I want
[28:02] you to think on this let's say go ahead
[28:04] number wrong good number one I want you
[28:08] to think about it here's what I want you
[28:11] to think about while they're getting it
[28:12] up
[28:12] Peter's explaining now listen Peters
[28:17] explaining how to get where he was he
[28:22] said I'm a born-again Christian and I'm
[28:24] teaching you to how to climb this
[28:26] stature of a perfect man alright how to
[28:31] get to where he was because there's
[28:33] worth 120 120 was birth right here where
[28:36] it says the Holy Spirit but we don't get
[28:41] that we start off by faith as a newborn
[28:42] babe we've done been through all of that
[28:45] mm-hmm see Paul Peters explaining listen
[28:50] Peters explaining I have achieved this
[28:55] new earth and I'm talking to you that
[28:59] has this new birth and says we need to
[29:03] come to the place of being of the divine
[29:06] nature of Almighty God all right
[29:10] he's explaining how to get to the faith
[29:14] of the fathers so he starts and shows
[29:20] you that the connection is the new birth
[29:25] he's putting everything right on to you
[29:28] that how the new birth you now have the
[29:31] ability to be able to achieve these
[29:36] virtues are you with me now let's see if
[29:40] Paul says that all right so we read we
[29:45] read in Galatians about
[29:49] right now that he's no different now
[29:53] when your child was born
[29:55] Paul is explaining when a child was born
[29:58] into the family it had rights to
[30:03] everything but it couldn't claim nothing
[30:06] it was an error you could not disinherit
[30:11] you could not take it away
[30:13] that was his but he was a baby even
[30:19] though he was heir he had to be put
[30:24] under tutors and governors all right
[30:28] but remember now he's explaining that
[30:30] you have to be a baby for now let's drop
[30:33] back a chapter right for chapter dealing
[30:40] with there as long as he's you know huh
[30:45] so we'll just read it now say that the
[30:49] heir as long as he's our child now
[30:54] listen to his language as long as he's a
[30:57] child now physically you become a
[31:01] natural child huh that's what he's
[31:03] talking about spiritually you become an
[31:05] actor become a spiritual child by the
[31:07] new words they'll now listen differeth
[31:11] nothing from a servant though he be Lord
[31:14] of all but is under tutors and governors
[31:17] until the time appointed of the Father
[31:20] even so we when we were children
[31:27] listen we're in bondage under the
[31:30] elements of the world because he
[31:32] explains in Romans and other how that we
[31:35] come lost right
[31:40] the Bible is explaining how we become
[31:43] lost and doomed and on the way to hell
[31:45] and we need to be born again all right
[31:48] now even so we when we were children
[31:52] were in bondage under the elements of
[31:55] the world but when the fullness of time
[31:57] was come God sent forth his son made of
[32:01] a woman
[32:02] right under the law to do what now to
[32:04] redeem them that were under the law that
[32:06] we might receive the adoption of sons
[32:08] and because he are sons and watch him
[32:14] God has sent forth the spirit of the son
[32:16] into your hearts crying Abba Father
[32:21] wherefore they are no more a servant but
[32:25] a son and if a son then an heir of God
[32:29] through Christ all right now we must lay
[32:34] aside a favorite doctrine of the people
[32:37] of this message always was eternal I
[32:43] know how to receive nothing I come in
[32:45] the world with eternal life
[32:46] I had eternal life when I come that's
[32:54] what I said we've got to lay those
[32:55] things aside because they're not
[32:56] scriptural
[33:00] Paul is explaining that we were under
[33:04] the elements of the world we were
[33:07] sinners lost in doom and had to be born
[33:10] again now watch him but when you receive
[33:15] the new birth what's what he's
[33:18] explaining we were children we were
[33:23] children were in bondage under the
[33:25] elements of the world we were lost
[33:27] doomed another way to hell but when the
[33:29] fullness of time was come God sent forth
[33:32] his son made of a woman made under the
[33:38] law Jesus came under the law to redeem
[33:40] them that were under the law that we
[33:42] might all receive that sonship learn to
[33:45] listen to redeem them that were under
[33:51] the law that we might receive the
[33:53] adoption of sons he's using the adoption
[33:57] to explain Gunnarsson in because your
[34:03] son's will see that I'd always a son I
[34:07] always had eternal life well is that
[34:13] what you believe
[34:14] I mean do you believe that you always
[34:18] was eternal that you always had eternal
[34:22] life then why did Jesus have to die now
[34:25] the Bible here says because he was he
[34:28] came for what
[34:29] and because we're sons god sent forth
[34:33] the spirit of his son into our hearts
[34:35] crying Abba Father but you see that's
[34:40] where the people of the message they
[34:42] believe they've got quotes of all coño
[34:44] always was eternal but read the quote
[34:47] and read before and after and see if the
[34:49] Prophet don't say if you have eternal
[34:53] life then you always was eternal what
[34:58] the eternal life because if you always
[35:03] was eternal then listen to me listen
[35:07] this is why I know I get hateful an hour
[35:09] ago but it's hateful within me you
[35:11] realize if you don't need eternal life
[35:13] Jesus Christ died in vain because he
[35:18] died to release that life then it could
[35:20] come and live in us he died in vain
[35:28] you're making the Bible approach false
[35:30] prophecy you realize what you're doing
[35:37] when you say I come into the world with
[35:39] eternal life I don't need nothing I come
[35:42] on folks
[35:43] you call this doctrine you call that
[35:45] doctrine that doctrine was in 1970
[35:49] called the to soul that you would born
[35:53] with to sold one from God one from the
[35:55] devil the one from God didn't need
[35:57] eternal life
[35:58] all you needed to do was kill the one
[36:00] that comes from the devil and he
[36:01] automatically was saved everything was
[36:03] finished that was the two soul doctrine
[36:06] and it's still here today among the
[36:08] people of the message in different ways
[36:11] in different forms he said well why tell
[36:18] us about it I'm preaching to you ain't
[36:23] preaching nobody else
[36:25] so you know what I'm assuming if I must
[36:28] preach this to you somebody in this
[36:29] building needs it it may be me first and
[36:32] I take that and I believe that but I
[36:36] believe also that people are still
[36:37] believing that same old time because you
[36:40] can't get over that so you can't just
[36:43] lay your whole life on the altar of God
[36:46] and say Lord come and save me o say that
[36:54] I say cause if I say I'd say then I
[36:57] ain't say and that means I'm lost you
[37:06] see one said I did what I did you see
[37:09] why I read what it did in the Prophet
[37:12] awake thou that sleepest get out of them
[37:16] denominations what Lulla eyes Loula eyes
[37:24] with brother Dale if we have one word
[37:29] off we're just as much a knight as
[37:33] anybody else's a knight that's as strong
[37:38] as I can put it but you see that's where
[37:42] I'm trying to tell you the Bible
[37:45] explains the plan of redemption to us
[37:48] what would we need redemption for if we
[37:51] always was eternal see that's making
[37:58] God's Word a false prophecy you realize
[38:01] what I mean if we always was eternal
[38:05] when Jesus Christ stood as a lamb slain
[38:06] for the foundation world that make the
[38:08] Bible of false prophecy you don't think
[38:11] that way do you realize what I just said
[38:17] are you listening if Jesus Christ didn't
[38:24] pay the price to release that life that
[38:26] was within him then it would make the
[38:29] Bible of false prophecy
[38:35] well that brother he just that's his
[38:38] wish I don't care what brother who you
[38:40] talking about I'm talking about anything
[38:42] off of the Word of God whether it be me
[38:46] you or who Italy all right see we think
[38:51] well we don't need eternal I co we
[38:53] already had it with in Jesus Christ died
[38:56] in vain and you make the entire Bible a
[38:59] false prophecy because the entire Bible
[39:02] listen that's what I'm trying to get you
[39:04] see with pollen feeder the entire Bible
[39:06] is explaining the plan of salvation Paul
[39:12] goes back into the Old Testament picks
[39:15] up the tops and the shadows from a son
[39:17] being born into the family and adoption
[39:20] of situation brought in and as he does
[39:24] he's explaining that that son not that
[39:29] he always was eternal and not it he who
[39:32] always was a son he had a day he became
[39:36] borned right so that does away with your
[39:41] eternal sonship sometimes now the day
[39:46] that baby was born he was born all right
[39:51] the day you was born again you was born
[39:54] again right tires were it all started in
[39:58] that new birth all right that's what
[40:01] Paul is explaining and taking the entire
[40:04] Old Testament to bring it forth you see
[40:12] how much did it it well if they don't
[40:16] ring in your heart then I under do you
[40:27] not know that you're responsible for
[40:32] your family do you not understand that
[40:40] nah ain't responsible for appellant
[40:43] believe me you're responsible to present
[40:45] it to him correctly if it's not
[40:48] presented correctly what are we so now
[40:59] listen Paul is saying because you are
[41:04] sons not that you didn't have to become
[41:08] he's using the baby of the Old Testament
[41:11] adoption that when he was born into the
[41:14] family he became a child of that family
[41:18] he was a Jones or Smith or whatever you
[41:21] want to call him he become of that name
[41:24] right then all right
[41:27] the end adoption goes through the
[41:30] tutorship of granting that tutorship to
[41:34] bring it to a position to where the son
[41:38] could be just like the father now I've
[41:42] asked you to read book sometime if you
[41:44] would please you know change to read
[41:47] adoption there's one books got three in
[41:50] it there's a bunch of here um there's a
[41:53] whole bunch the Prophet explains the
[41:57] adoption explains exactly what I'm
[42:00] talking about
[42:02] that the day you get born again you are
[42:06] just as much a child of God as you will
[42:10] ever be you are just as eternal in your
[42:15] soul the day you receive the new birth
[42:17] as you will ever be that new birth is
[42:22] Christ coming and living in you how much
[42:26] more simple then is it all you got to do
[42:31] is invite him into your heart all you
[42:37] got to do is invite him in you'll come
[42:40] in and you'll give you the new birth
[42:42] which is eternal huh all right then
[42:46] these virtues will be automatically
[42:47] added why because you'll be in the body
[42:49] of Christ
[42:49] you automatically Danny when you was
[42:52] born and your Mama and Daddy
[42:54] brought you you come from Underwood a
[42:57] baby
[42:59] well they fed him but that's all you
[43:01] could do well they wouldn't anything
[43:06] else they could do to add to him they
[43:08] didn't go get this and go get now notice
[43:10] you're standing and that's the way God
[43:13] does he just feeds us His Word and we
[43:17] grow in the world as we receive the word
[43:22] until we become what he wants us to be
[43:26] Christians why is it in the statute of a
[43:31] perfect man you've read it over and over
[43:33] that we me not no more hindered by all
[43:37] of these things of the world brother
[43:42] Dale I know I just I just don't
[43:45] understand because brother soul says
[43:46] it's just what brother so-and-so says
[43:48] it's out of way and brother stole what
[43:49] says it says away and this and says it's
[43:51] that away
[43:51] I just don't know which one to believe
[43:58] well I would suggest that you do what
[44:08] you ought to do I would suggest going on
[44:14] your knees and a closet and cry out to
[44:18] God is that sister did in blasphemous
[44:20] names when she was concerned whether she
[44:23] had the new birth or not she went to God
[44:27] and she cried out to get an answer God
[44:32] gave her a dream so much to answer her
[44:36] question and sent that dream to the
[44:38] Prophet to interpret that cry out to God
[44:47] and ask him Lord do I have it because I
[44:56] know for certain one thing I've got to
[44:57] have it to go in a chain through the
[44:59] body
[44:59] or else I'm going by the grave and come
[45:02] out to know some other way but for me to
[45:05] make a change the Prophet talks about it
[45:08] come take rapture and faith I was
[45:09] looking at that this evening some of the
[45:11] quote from the seal book it's gonna take
[45:15] rapture and faith for a bride to be able
[45:17] to be changed in a moment a twinkle of
[45:18] an eye but we call along haphazardly you
[45:25] know and don't get serious about any
[45:27] time but see this get the Bible to start
[45:33] reading it I remember brother Gary he
[45:38] the brother Gary Atkins he told him one
[45:42] time we won't even teach Sunday school
[45:43] and he said to a law well I'm not gonna
[45:49] teach Sunday school what I'm gonna teach
[45:51] I said well if I was you and I'm asking
[45:56] you to teach it and take that class and
[45:57] do it I said I got confidence in you and
[45:59] I said what I'd ask you to do is turn
[46:01] the Romans 1 yeah I don't know how to
[46:06] get there I said I didn't I said this
[46:09] turning to Romans 1 and you read Romans
[46:13] 1 and you start from there and you get
[46:17] up before that class and you explained
[46:20] Romans 1 to that class about two or
[46:27] three weeks later he come up and he said
[46:29] brother Dale I ain't got off of verse
[46:33] three yet
[46:34] I said and you won't because it'll open
[46:41] he'll tell you what to say just read it
[46:45] just read Romans 1 when you go home just
[46:51] read Romans 1 didn't just think about
[46:56] what do you say you know what I'm trying
[47:00] to get you to see is the point they'll
[47:02] get it this way for the point for the
[47:05] night Peter is explaining the virtues
[47:08] and we must have those virtues to be in
[47:12] the Statue of a perfect man Paul is
[47:14] explaining adoption they are both
[47:17] explained in the same thing it's not
[47:19] like a man that I remember years
[47:21] go said it you know he was a preacher he
[47:24] said that that statue of perfect man
[47:27] said that simple we said that adoption
[47:30] is deep I thought Lord what's wrong with
[47:35] a man it's the same thing now listen if
[47:43] I can read it to you from the Word of
[47:45] God that Peter now we've been through
[47:49] this a lot right so all right we need
[47:52] need to read it Peters explaining in 2nd
[47:55] Peter 1 he's explaining that he had
[48:01] those virtues and he was trying to
[48:04] explain to the people there that had the
[48:08] same new birth that he did he was
[48:14] explaining a growth development in the
[48:16] opening of God's Word are the faith of
[48:19] the father's to open up the Word of God
[48:23] to the people and he said device
[48:26] explaining the divine nature of Almighty
[48:30] God and now you had to grow into those
[48:33] things now is that what Peter's saying
[48:36] well let's read Paul and see what Paul
[48:39] is saying in his message just prior to
[48:43] Galatians 4 we just read in Galatians 4
[48:49] desire is no different though he be a
[48:52] son he's no different
[48:55] he's a child no he be a son all right
[49:02] but you've got to be born again to be a
[49:04] son because the natural story he was
[49:08] using the child had to be physically
[49:13] born to be a part of that family
[49:16] all right and then the child would grow
[49:20] up as he was given tutors and governors
[49:27] now listen come on you that's been in
[49:29] the message quite a while
[49:30] why did brother Branham called the tutor
[49:32] of the statue of perfect man
[49:35] the Holy Ghost is the tutor all right if
[49:38] you always was eternal what do you need
[49:40] to hold a gun
[49:41] you see Church why it gets within my
[49:43] heart and I'm sorry but when we get over
[49:47] on that other side and we're standing
[49:48] there you won't be thinking the way you
[49:50] think now why would you need a tutor if
[49:55] you always was eternal and why would he
[49:58] give you the Holy Ghost as a tutor if
[50:00] you always was eternal well don't you
[50:10] think that the Holy Ghost is a tutor
[50:11] yeah because now he's teaching us
[50:16] something all right let's go ahead let's
[50:18] get started on this one go to Galatians
[50:20] three we'll just pick up an eleventh
[50:22] verse and read down now remember my
[50:24] point Peter you're saying we need these
[50:30] things and you're saying that you were
[50:34] that we were born-again by faith and
[50:37] that we need to put a curse of the
[50:40] divine nature so you're saying that was
[50:43] already dire we needed that you know
[50:46] that was in us by the new birth but we
[50:50] need a growth development all right now
[50:53] Paul what are you gonna say but then no
[50:57] man is justified by the law in the sight
[50:58] of God is evident for the just shall
[51:01] live by faith so where we starting off
[51:03] at same time Peter starts faith right
[51:06] Peter started to faith right where's
[51:10] Paul starting then what's him the Lord
[51:14] is not of faith but the man that doeth
[51:16] them shall live in them Christ has
[51:19] redeemed us from the curse of the law
[51:20] being made a curse for us for it is
[51:23] written cursed is every one that hangeth
[51:25] on the tree that's a blessing of Abraham
[51:27] might come on the Gentiles through Jesus
[51:29] Christ that we might receive the promise
[51:33] of the Spirit through faith that we
[51:35] might receive so it's not saying we've
[51:37] already got it we just need to realize
[51:40] we got it and we're okay he's always
[51:42] talking about we need to receive it and
[51:44] how is it done promise of the Spirit
[51:46] through faith
[51:48] not speak after the manner of men though
[51:50] be it but a man's covenant if it be
[51:53] confirmed gnome and isn't this another
[51:55] or at estar to now to Abraham and his
[51:59] seed were the promises made and he says
[52:02] not and the seeds as of many but as of
[52:05] one and to thy seed which is Christ and
[52:08] this I say that the Covenant that was
[52:11] confirmed before of God in Christ the
[52:13] law which was 430 years after I was
[52:17] Abraham the law promise was made four
[52:19] hundred thirty years after cannot
[52:22] dishonor that it should make the promise
[52:24] of none effect for if the inheritance be
[52:28] of the law is no more promise but God
[52:32] gave it to Abraham by promise wherefore
[52:36] then serveth the law it was added
[52:41] because of transgressions till the seed
[52:46] singular should come to whom the promise
[52:50] was made and it was ordained by angels
[52:53] in the hand of a mediator who this seed
[52:59] now mediator is not a mediator of one
[53:02] but God is one is the law then against
[53:05] the promises of God God forbid where if
[53:08] there had been a law givers which could
[53:10] have given life verily righteousness
[53:12] should have been by the law if there was
[53:14] any other way to come to eternal life
[53:16] then through Jesus Christ then why
[53:18] didn't God bring it that way are you
[53:20] reading but the scripture hath concluded
[53:25] all under sin oh no we wouldn't sinners
[53:29] don't tell me I descend I always was
[53:31] eternal was you an eternal center
[53:35] because the Bible says you're a sinner
[53:37] the prophets said you're a sinner he
[53:39] said on the Christians sin am i right
[53:46] now was you an eternal sinner
[53:50] no I hate eternal life
[53:54] you're still playing under the law you
[53:58] have
[53:59] come to the seed yet listen is the law
[54:03] then against the promises of God god
[54:06] forbid or if there had been a law given
[54:08] which could have given life verily
[54:10] righteousness should have been by the
[54:12] law if there's any good and anything is
[54:15] sure to come by that and it didn't do it
[54:17] like but the scripture hath concluded
[54:19] all under sin that the promise by faith
[54:22] of Jesus Christ might be given to them
[54:25] that belief oh no what but before faith
[54:33] came we were kept under the law before
[54:42] faith came you were kept under the law
[54:46] come on I walked out of the Baptist
[54:48] Church realizing one time and I've
[54:53] always talked this ever person in the
[54:58] world unless you're born again you're
[55:01] still under the law I don't care who you
[55:05] are I don't care how righteous you think
[55:07] you are you're under the law if you're
[55:09] not born again why because the Bible
[55:11] says Christ is the end of the law for
[55:13] righteousness and I walk out of that
[55:16] Baptist Church I realized knowing one
[55:21] thing for sure
[55:23] everybody was lost and needed a savior
[55:28] so when I come in this message that I
[55:31] need to have to study from the Prophet
[55:33] to find out now when he began to say
[55:35] always was eternal I knew he was saying
[55:37] something he wasn't saying what we were
[55:41] saying he was trying to get us to see
[55:46] something come on now we were kept under
[55:54] the law shut up unto the faith which
[55:56] should afterwards be revealed wherefore
[55:59] the law was our schoolmaster and what
[56:08] like sinful one he says we don't need a
[56:10] schoolmaster we don't need governor's
[56:12] huh Bree he's telling what a
[56:17] schoolmaster which is the same word as
[56:19] as governor we're for the law was our
[56:26] schoolmaster now come on that's why Paul
[56:32] said the law was spiritual you remember
[56:38] that's Christian he said but I'm carnal
[56:42] sold under sin the law was the Word of
[56:47] God in letter form which was God in
[56:51] letter form to come to condemn us we
[56:57] just read it the law was added because
[56:59] of transgressions what to condemn us to
[57:05] make us realize we were lost the law was
[57:10] to make us realize rude law not to make
[57:12] us think we're something this message
[57:14] was not brought to make us think we're
[57:16] something it was brought to show us who
[57:18] we are that without Christ we're lost
[57:24] without a new birds we have no hope
[57:28] there is no rapture for anybody if we
[57:32] don't get mourned again what I just
[57:40] always wanted eternal will fifty years
[57:42] from the time you started saying that
[57:43] you still sitting here dying sorry
[57:49] brother Dale just I know it I say things
[57:52] that is just hateful but one of these
[57:55] days you'll hug my neck and you'll say
[57:57] thank you sir because that shook me
[58:02] enough that night to make me wake up if
[58:07] there's nothing you see no whatsoever if
[58:09] you need a tutor why did he give you the
[58:13] Holy Ghost if you already had to hold it
[58:15] up
[58:17] and I don't see why people can't
[58:19] understand that's plain language why
[58:22] would he give you the Holy Ghost if you
[58:23] already have eternal life
[58:25] oh you just don't understand the great
[58:29] mystery that is a mystery we're for the
[58:36] law Paul what is the law it's virtual
[58:41] the law is the Word of God now brother
[58:44] Branham said the Ten Commandments was
[58:48] the same as the seals you remember that
[58:51] you need that quote the Ten Commandments
[58:55] is the same as the seals seals is
[58:56] Simon's ten command so what are the
[58:58] seals to reveal wage was striking a
[59:02] Sunday afternoon on the third seal of
[59:05] seeing marriage and divorce I said it in
[59:12] 82 I don't back up I said in 82 that
[59:21] marriage and divorce is revealed in the
[59:23] seals it was in the seals everything is
[59:35] revealing to see is ke o wherefore the
[59:38] law was our schoolmaster for what to
[59:40] bring us unto Christ that we might be
[59:43] justified by faith see the law is just
[59:47] bringing you to cross
[59:48] it's just condemns you that's all the
[59:50] law was added for for a condemnation it
[59:54] couldn't save you yet it was the Word of
[59:57] God yet it was spiritual as Paul said
[59:59] but all they could do was condemn you
[1:00:02] until you got born again then you can be
[1:00:05] justified by faith then you can see what
[1:00:11] Jesus Christ was doing and why you had
[1:00:13] to accept him as your Savior then when
[1:00:19] you accepted him as your Savior
[1:00:21] he went from a schoolmaster to a
[1:00:23] governor or tutor a schoolmaster which
[1:00:28] had condemned you to a governor or tutor
[1:00:30] which took your place as long as that
[1:00:40] tutors there you don't have to worry
[1:00:42] about anything as long as that governor
[1:00:47] is with you you do not have to worry
[1:00:50] about nothing
[1:00:53] Satan can't get to you until God is
[1:00:57] through we don't care how old you get
[1:01:02] what are they they can't get to you look
[1:01:05] now you said wait a minute what know
[1:01:07] what what you okay
[1:01:09] or for the law was our schoolmaster to
[1:01:11] bring us unto Christ that we might be
[1:01:13] justified by faith but after faith is
[1:01:15] come we are no longer under a
[1:01:18] schoolmaster the Galatians 4 says we're
[1:01:25] under tutors and governors the word
[1:01:29] governors are the same word is
[1:01:31] schoolmaster what's it saying
[1:01:35] Paul what are you talking about you're
[1:01:38] telling me over here I don't that I've
[1:01:39] got to have a tutor a governor to child
[1:01:43] trained me but just prior to that you're
[1:01:47] saying the schoolmaster was done away
[1:01:50] and we don't need a schoolmaster anymore
[1:01:55] you know what the law really is the law
[1:01:59] is a record keeper you realize that they
[1:02:04] would be no record of your sin had law
[1:02:08] not entered the picture why did Jesus
[1:02:17] have to go preach to the spirits that
[1:02:20] was in prison that were disobedient
[1:02:23] longsuffering today's or Noah because
[1:02:25] they had no condemnation come on get
[1:02:28] into Word
[1:02:29] there was no condemnation back there
[1:02:32] because the law had not come all they
[1:02:35] had was a couple of prophets Enoch Noah
[1:02:42] why did Jesus have to go to them why
[1:02:45] does it say that group that he had to go
[1:02:47] to those that that were disobedient in
[1:02:49] the long-suffering of days of Noah why
[1:02:51] didn't it say that that he went to
[1:02:53] preach to all of them
[1:02:56] because they had the law see when the
[1:03:01] law came into existence through Moses
[1:03:05] from their own you had a condemn err you
[1:03:10] had a judge and a law set before you and
[1:03:15] that's why I said what I did and I've
[1:03:17] always believed it that if you're not
[1:03:20] born again you are still under the law
[1:03:25] the law is you're condemned err if
[1:03:28] you're not born again you see why the
[1:03:30] new birth is the most important thing
[1:03:32] that could ever be thought of in your
[1:03:33] life well brother bill you scare me I
[1:03:38] don't know that well then you're getting
[1:03:39] scared about the Holy Ghost seek God but
[1:03:47] look where for the law is our
[1:03:51] schoolmaster to bring us to Christ now
[1:03:58] you how long you want to stay you want
[1:04:01] me to preach for a couple of hours on
[1:04:02] one topic you know that brother Branham
[1:04:04] said the denomination's was our
[1:04:07] schoolmaster
[1:04:09] oh now you're going to go haywire I
[1:04:13] didn't say it he did I'll find that
[1:04:16] quote well how come because they were
[1:04:23] law givers reformers right Tojo and
[1:04:29] through that Reformers back in reformers
[1:04:33] Luther Wesson in reformers
[1:04:36] you went to church you had a book a rule
[1:04:39] set before you come on you went to
[1:04:43] church you took on those rules and you
[1:04:45] started trying to live by them
[1:04:47] don't do this don't do that don't do
[1:04:49] this don't do that then you try to make
[1:04:53] it your righteousness
[1:04:56] that's what the denominations don't know
[1:04:58] yes I didn't say it your prophet did he
[1:05:02] said in denominations with a
[1:05:04] schoolmaster I thank God for what
[1:05:07] they've done for me let's go don't thank
[1:05:10] God then walk around when they promote
[1:05:12] backyard I'm gonna prostitute you
[1:05:17] better remember you as one of them if I
[1:05:25] could go today and every preacher that
[1:05:27] I've ever heard preach no matter who he
[1:05:29] was Methodist Baptist or what and I
[1:05:31] could raise him from the dead I'd shake
[1:05:33] his hand say thank you sir I've had to
[1:05:41] leave a couple of churches in his
[1:05:43] message but there's one thing about it
[1:05:45] I never left with the wrong thought in
[1:05:49] my mind and I told each one of those
[1:05:52] brothers I appreciate what you've done
[1:05:55] for me because you've brought me to
[1:05:59] Jesus Christ how do you feel would you
[1:06:04] go back now where you come from and get
[1:06:07] up and say thank you for teaching me
[1:06:10] what little bit you could about Jesus
[1:06:12] Christ there's something wrong way if
[1:06:15] you came to church look or for the law
[1:06:21] was our schoolmaster to bring us unto
[1:06:23] Christ to bring us to the new birth then
[1:06:27] we might be justified by faith the new
[1:06:29] birth but after that faith has come we
[1:06:32] are no longer under a schoolmaster the
[1:06:37] new birth is not a book of rules it's a
[1:06:40] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[1:06:43] you it's not a book of rules the new
[1:06:47] birth has no rules in it
[1:06:49] that's why brother would not listen
[1:06:51] that's why brother Branham said statue a
[1:06:53] perfect man he said you get born again
[1:06:57] you receive eternal life by faith by
[1:07:00] believing in Jesus Christ he said you
[1:07:02] don't have to worry now come on am i
[1:07:04] quoting it you don't have to worry about
[1:07:07] Virtue's they will be automatically
[1:07:10] added not automatically added coach you
[1:07:16] fault fooling around at Walmart name
[1:07:17] studying come on it's automatically
[1:07:20] added because you healed yourself Ian -
[1:07:23] Jesus Christ
[1:07:24] and after that faith has come we are no
[1:07:28] longer under a schoolmaster
[1:07:31] but Galatians 4 he says were under
[1:07:34] tutors and governors so it changed from
[1:07:37] a schoolmaster which was a book of rules
[1:07:39] to a revelation of Jesus Christ as our
[1:07:44] tutor as a governor to lead us and
[1:07:49] direct us after that faith has come
[1:07:55] we're no longer under a schoolmaster for
[1:07:59] you're all the children of God by faith
[1:08:01] in Jesus Christ for as many of you as
[1:08:04] have been baptized into Christ have put
[1:08:07] on Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek
[1:08:10] there is neither bond nor free there is
[1:08:14] neither male nor female and you're all
[1:08:16] one in Christ and if you be Christ's
[1:08:18] then are you Abraham's seed and heirs
[1:08:22] according to the promise
[1:08:24] Oh what are you saying Peter is
[1:08:28] explaining to them in 2nd Peter that you
[1:08:33] need to be born again you you you people
[1:08:35] sitting here you've said you've accepted
[1:08:38] Jesus Christ as your Savior now let's go
[1:08:41] on in God let's grow up in him that we'd
[1:08:44] be no longer children tossed to and fro
[1:08:47] by every wind of doctrine an idea of
[1:08:49] man's cunningness let's go on him Christ
[1:08:52] Paul what are you doing all is telling
[1:08:55] you the law was your schoolmaster to
[1:08:59] bring you to Christ
[1:09:03] what would you been without the law
[1:09:06] unless God we don't need no law see
[1:09:09] that's where you don't understand
[1:09:10] nothing about the gospel that law was
[1:09:12] put there to bring you to a condemnation
[1:09:16] you would have not known Paul said the
[1:09:21] it was wrong what how does he say it now
[1:09:22] if I misquote the script but he said you
[1:09:24] wouldn't have known that was wrong too
[1:09:26] to committed how did he say it to do
[1:09:28] lust if it hadn't said thou shalt not
[1:09:30] come on somebody quote the scripture for
[1:09:33] me you wouldn't have known it had the
[1:09:35] Bible had not told you not to covet you
[1:09:41] were to know that it was wrong if the
[1:09:43] law had not brought the condemnation
[1:09:51] there was no grace and listened
[1:09:55] there was no grace in the law it was a
[1:09:59] condemned ER but while the law was here
[1:10:03] grace was present Nathan - David does
[1:10:16] that rightly the one that contacted
[1:10:17] David death Nathan walks in and he says
[1:10:21] David we got a little situation out here
[1:10:23] this happened he said we got a problem
[1:10:27] then we got this man over here that says
[1:10:30] he's got all of these goats and sheep
[1:10:33] and huh and said he looks over to
[1:10:36] neighbor and he sees one the low goat
[1:10:38] one little sheet one of the lamb and he
[1:10:43] says I'll go take that lamb what should
[1:10:49] we do what would be David what would be
[1:10:52] the law what would be the commandments
[1:10:55] of the law brought by Moses what are we
[1:10:58] supposed to do with this man David said
[1:11:01] bring him here I'll kill him read your
[1:11:05] Bible
[1:11:06] see if I'm telling it right bring him
[1:11:09] here
[1:11:10] I'll kill him Nathan look back and said
[1:11:14] David thou art the man when I watch him
[1:11:22] as quick as he said it he knew David was
[1:11:25] condemned and David would have condemned
[1:11:27] his own self probably would have cut his
[1:11:29] own throat because he knew who he was
[1:11:32] and what he was doing
[1:11:34] and he was standing there but before the
[1:11:38] law could bring the judgment of the
[1:11:41] punishment down upon David for what he
[1:11:43] done a prophet remember what we're
[1:11:46] trying to bring out Sunday the Thunder
[1:11:49] is the voice of God through the prophet
[1:11:51] god thundered through that prophet
[1:11:53] Nathan and said David you shall not die
[1:11:58] said I paid for you
[1:12:02] Richy Bible said David you shall not die
[1:12:09] from the voice of a man comes salvation
[1:12:14] to a king
[1:12:18] no wonder David could rest of his life
[1:12:22] cry out he instilled it so much that was
[1:12:25] in Saul I mean in Solomon but David
[1:12:32] could cry out Lord return unto me the
[1:12:34] joy of thy salvation Lord my soul longs
[1:12:41] after you O Lord I've seen you you gave
[1:12:45] me life when my judgment was death and I
[1:12:50] condemned my own self by what I said
[1:12:54] come on David said bring him I'll kill
[1:12:57] him but he said David you're the man
[1:13:02] which said you won't die see the law had
[1:13:06] no grace because the law meant David
[1:13:08] died that was it but God sent grace that
[1:13:12] totally overrode the law and everything
[1:13:14] and said David you won't die blessed is
[1:13:17] the man the Bible says that God will not
[1:13:20] impute sin is that Scripture well then
[1:13:29] we must get by with anything that
[1:13:30] wouldn't work now I'll remind you that
[1:13:32] David spent the rest of his life I'm
[1:13:36] asking you to read your Bible read your
[1:13:38] songs of Solomon read and read are the
[1:13:41] David to writing in the Psalms maybe
[1:13:43] your whichever one is he in the songs or
[1:13:45] the doing that David wrote saw
[1:13:47] it's all wrote Solomon wrote the other
[1:13:52] but David spent the rest of his life
[1:13:56] trying to find peace with God not that
[1:14:04] God was against David to kill him
[1:14:06] I was thinking about that today it's no
[1:14:15] problem to do wrong we all do what was
[1:14:20] your is wrong I think I didn't say that
[1:14:22] you ain't listening we all do wrong we
[1:14:29] all do and we condemn our own selves but
[1:14:33] you know what's the worst sin I tried to
[1:14:37] explain it now quit on me the worst sin
[1:14:40] that you could ever think of what is it
[1:14:44] what is the worst sin that you could
[1:14:46] think of anything you want to name in
[1:14:49] the Bible we'll find those guys that
[1:14:52] have that spot
[1:14:55] David had a man kill David done this
[1:14:58] David done that solve all Samson every
[1:15:02] one of them everybody but what's the
[1:15:07] greatest sin you could think of
[1:15:13] the most condemning thoughts in my mind
[1:15:18] is one thing for me to know that God
[1:15:26] will not throw me away because he gave
[1:15:29] me the new birth
[1:15:35] you can't sin enough to get rid of the
[1:15:37] Holy Ghost sorry but that's just me
[1:15:43] you can't sin enough but if you sin you
[1:15:46] prove once y'all now we're right back
[1:15:49] where we started but the worst thing
[1:15:52] that I can think of is for me to realize
[1:15:55] that I can get by and that God won't
[1:16:01] destroy me because he didn't destroy
[1:16:02] David but for me to think that I could
[1:16:08] get by with it the most horrible sin in
[1:16:15] our thoughts and our lives is to think
[1:16:18] of those things because listen church if
[1:16:21] you're born again God may have to take
[1:16:25] you off singing I mean we know the whole
[1:16:29] story all right we're in the message we
[1:16:31] know the whole story
[1:16:33] he may have take you off the scene but
[1:16:36] he can't take back eternal life if he
[1:16:39] gave it to you but for me to know that
[1:16:43] and think that I can get by it sends you
[1:16:50] to your knees to cry out for an eternal
[1:16:54] God to try to save me from myself all
[1:17:02] should deliver me Lord from this man
[1:17:04] that I am
[1:17:11] to anybody that's ever accepted Jesus
[1:17:14] Christ as our Savior and tried to walk
[1:17:18] in Christ will come to a place that God
[1:17:22] will contact you and let you know how
[1:17:25] everything is and what's going on so
[1:17:28] just wait on him it may take another 50
[1:17:30] years
[1:17:30] but whose word so that means I won't be
[1:17:35] harder than screaming at you 50 years
[1:17:37] ago but I pray somebody else will
[1:17:40] because of one thing Paul and Peter was
[1:17:48] saying the same thing
[1:17:49] there was a channel 2 way to come to God
[1:17:54] Paul calls it adoption now if you notice
[1:17:58] I cut it off right at that line because
[1:18:02] we had cut off on the statute of perfect
[1:18:04] lamb right at that line of where it says
[1:18:06] next will be add to your faith virtue
[1:18:11] because Peter is saying you are
[1:18:14] born-again Christians out there you want
[1:18:17] to be partakers of the divine nature of
[1:18:19] Almighty God said now we're gonna have
[1:18:22] to add virtue Paul comes along he said a
[1:18:28] child is no different though he be heir
[1:18:32] of all things when he's born he's a baby
[1:18:39] and he has to have a growth development
[1:18:41] to arise in Christianity and he will be
[1:18:45] given a tutor
[1:18:47] Peter you could say Peter what he doing
[1:18:49] he said I want you to realize now listen
[1:18:54] church Peter I want you to realize that
[1:18:59] that Holy Spirit you received is your
[1:19:02] tutor he's your governor he's your
[1:19:09] advocate he's everything that you have
[1:19:15] need of so just let him add his own life
[1:19:22] to your life
[1:19:25] just let him manifest himself through
[1:19:29] you is that not exactly what Paul will
[1:19:32] say it the Sun when he's born new birth
[1:19:37] he's birth he gets a birth and says now
[1:19:40] he's given no longer a schoolmaster it's
[1:19:44] well I love that I I've got that marked
[1:19:46] in my Bible here goes to here because
[1:19:49] here he says this and that's even the
[1:19:52] exact same definition of governor is the
[1:19:55] same definition of schoolmaster but yet
[1:19:59] up here he's telling you that you had a
[1:20:01] schoolmaster then down here he says you
[1:20:05] don't need a schoolmaster the next verse
[1:20:09] later on you don't need a schoolmaster
[1:20:11] II said because you've changed from a
[1:20:13] schoolmaster a lawgiver a book of rules
[1:20:16] you change to a revelation of Jesus
[1:20:19] Christ you change to work that he would
[1:20:23] be your tutor your governor you realize
[1:20:27] the day you receive the new birth you
[1:20:28] received a tutor you were brought into
[1:20:33] the family of God by the new birth of
[1:20:35] faith and when we were brought into that
[1:20:37] family that makes us a child of God
[1:20:39] whereby we cry out my father father
[1:20:42] father is what we cry he'll take care of
[1:20:50] the rest of it if we'll just volunteer
[1:20:53] ourselves it's not a hard thing to do
[1:20:57] and I'll tell you it's honest that I can
[1:21:03] do it and if they don't make you shout
[1:21:04] then that's alright I believe we're a
[1:21:06] whole lot further up the road and we
[1:21:08] even think we are I do
[1:21:15] but just don't let that blow your head
[1:21:17] too much you know what I mean I mean you
[1:21:21] know a lot of people if they've preached
[1:21:23] the things that I preached over the
[1:21:24] years that I've been here you couldn't
[1:21:26] get their head inside this building cuz
[1:21:28] it blow it so big but you know what it's
[1:21:31] done with - shrunk it - one time
[1:21:36] Christ is the end of the law for
[1:21:41] righteousness to them that believe
[1:21:46] if you've accepted Jesus Christ as your
[1:21:48] Savior then there's nothing more that
[1:21:51] could be other than taking you to a
[1:21:53] change and he'll do that but if we don't
[1:22:00] volunteer ourselves what do we do like I
[1:22:02] said I have to quote in here where the
[1:22:03] Prophet said I looked in Pentecost and
[1:22:05] thought we had 40 years that we've been
[1:22:07] way and I said to our life and I said
[1:22:09] Lord it's been over 40 years since the
[1:22:12] Prophet left this thing and we're still
[1:22:14] Harlan and stumping around Horeb trying
[1:22:18] to get ready to go into the Promised
[1:22:20] Land
[1:22:25] come on musicians be then that's where
[1:22:31] we've come to it's off the message and
[1:22:38] thy seed shall possess the gate of the
[1:22:40] enemy that's what it is today
[1:22:43] we've had about 40 years of testing of
[1:22:48] Pentecost or more C testing the church
[1:22:53] seeing whether they're going to stand or
[1:22:56] not I hope you follow this out we'll
[1:23:06] pick it back up Sunday and this reminds
[1:23:09] you of it if you're if you're a
[1:23:12] schoolmaster has not turned into a
[1:23:16] tutoring governor you need the new birth
[1:23:21] your schoolmaster brought you to Christ
[1:23:26] come on your schoolmaster brings you to
[1:23:29] Christ
[1:23:32] well how much more could be there bring
[1:23:34] me the cross is have Christ accept you
[1:23:37] and come and live in you it changes from
[1:23:42] a schoolmaster and you no longer as Paul
[1:23:45] said need him but then the very next
[1:23:48] verse
[1:23:49] when he explains the adoption he says
[1:23:52] you get a tutor or governor it changed
[1:23:59] from a book of rules and regulations and
[1:24:01] ideas our thoughts and opinions we had
[1:24:04] it changed to a revelation of Jesus
[1:24:07] Christ from this message

[1:28:48] to make ourselves better try to do this
[1:28:50] try to repair that and all that was well
[1:28:52] and good but all we should have done was
[1:28:56] just went straight to him we're
[1:29:01] listening to the jorgensen you know the
[1:29:04] reading and things of random and all and
[1:29:07] was listening here the other week about
[1:29:09] him explaining his experience or the
[1:29:12] lady you know that's telling it on the
[1:29:14] phone well you get down in brother
[1:29:17] Browns experience and you'll find he's
[1:29:19] over here doing one time you'll find
[1:29:20] he's over here doing something you'll
[1:29:22] find he's over there doing something and
[1:29:24] I know why you want to say well where's
[1:29:26] the app and see you're trying to figure
[1:29:30] out well where was he doing and you're
[1:29:32] trying to do the same thing he said I
[1:29:33] got down and said you know and I'm sure
[1:29:35] he must have put his hands or something
[1:29:37] he said I've heard people say you put
[1:29:38] your hands you know and he probably done
[1:29:40] something like this you know it any
[1:29:42] problem but he said it didn't work
[1:29:44] he said he not done this and I've done
[1:29:46] that and after a while he said it like
[1:29:51] this he said no sir he says
[1:29:55] I'm gonna just talk to you you remember
[1:29:58] that said sir I'm gonna just talk to you
[1:30:03] so now I know you I can't understand
[1:30:05] your language or whatever you say some
[1:30:07] way like everyone said I just won't talk
[1:30:10] to you you know what it's become a
[1:30:12] serious matter that he was standing
[1:30:15] there and didn't know how to do anything
[1:30:16] else he said I don't talk to you
[1:30:18] why don't you sometime in the middle of
[1:30:21] the night children dog why don't you
[1:30:25] just get on the edge of the bed god I
[1:30:30] just won't talk to you
[1:30:31] I just won't talk to you I want you to
[1:30:37] come into my heart and save me I want
[1:30:41] you to just become my guardian my Savior
[1:30:43] my all and all and you do whatever it
[1:30:49] takes to take care of me to supply
[1:30:51] everything I don't know nothing about it
[1:30:53] I'm just putting my hand in my heart
[1:30:56] into your hands Lord and just you just
[1:30:58] come and save my soul you see that's
[1:31:06] where people don't understand me because
[1:31:07] they think that that I'm not emotional
[1:31:09] I'm not this but there's one thing about
[1:31:11] it if you get saved there's going to be
[1:31:14] an emotion in your heart there's going
[1:31:18] to be a rejoicing within you you may not
[1:31:21] let it out that everybody else sees it
[1:31:23] but it's going to be there you're going
[1:31:26] to shout and you're going to cry glory
[1:31:27] hallelujah but it may be in your own
[1:31:29] little prior closet and nobody here
[1:31:33] that's the way God can do that because
[1:31:37] it's according to your nature in your
[1:31:39] ways and your thinking determines a lot
[1:31:42] of it but the main thing is just to talk
[1:31:44] to them have you ever got to where you
[1:31:49] Clinton pray you've never been that far
[1:31:52] done
[1:31:54] you ain't never been that far down and
[1:31:56] beat down that you couldn't pray you got
[1:31:59] a long ways to go one of these days
[1:32:00] you're gonna get tired you say you're
[1:32:03] scaring me and no I'm just telling you
[1:32:05] it's gonna happen someday
[1:32:08] that you're gonna get to a place until
[1:32:11] where use his combs like Lord ain't
[1:32:17] nothing I can do but just say thank you
[1:32:22] for saving my soul just talk to him like
[1:32:31] he's an individual because he is and you
[1:32:37] know what here you know they nobody
[1:32:39] hooked in on your telephone line so
[1:32:42] don't worry about telling him everything
[1:32:44] right don't be concerned well I might
[1:32:48] say something that some other angel
[1:32:50] might hear don't worry about it
[1:32:51] you got a personal line straight to the
[1:32:54] Lord and you talk straight to him and
[1:32:57] just say Lord save me I'm sorry I'm
[1:33:05] sorry for being the way I am Lord just
[1:33:10] save me
[1:33:11] you know you might find out things might
[1:33:14] work a little different right see we've
[1:33:21] been taught it's this away or this
[1:33:22] people they donated and we want to
[1:33:24] follow after them and that's all but
[1:33:28] it's something personal to you some
[1:33:33] person he's your Savior but I hope you
[1:33:39] listened to what I was saying what about
[1:33:41] the Bible Paul saying was a schoolmaster
[1:33:44] to bring us to Christ one verse later he
[1:33:48] says the schoolmaster is gone
[1:33:51] we're no longer under a schoolmaster 10
[1:33:56] verses next an opening of the next
[1:33:58] chapter and he's talking about how you
[1:34:02] as a child and that God gave you himself
[1:34:05] as a tutor or governor did he take away
[1:34:12] the schoolmaster again now he opened the
[1:34:15] word to let you realize
[1:34:20] he made the word alive David what was in
[1:34:29] he's adored in order that word have I
[1:34:33] hid in my heart that I might not sin
[1:34:36] against these either him or Solomon 1
[1:34:38] what a wonderful thing that a man could
[1:34:41] think about father I pray that what we
[1:34:49] said tonight has been worthy I'm sorry
[1:34:52] for the way of saying it cause I'm just
[1:34:54] human but I'm crying out unto you to get
[1:34:58] away to express the things that we have
[1:35:01] need of and in doing that I know I
[1:35:04] stumble and fall after many things but
[1:35:07] yet I still want one thing and that's
[1:35:10] you Lord to manifest yourself among us
[1:35:12] here
[1:35:13] they don't make no difference what this
[1:35:15] is or what that is it's all in you help
[1:35:19] us to just walk upright in your love
