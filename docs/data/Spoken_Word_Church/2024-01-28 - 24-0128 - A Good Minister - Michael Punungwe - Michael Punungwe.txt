TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hello amen God bless you Saints it's good to be in the house of the Lord happy to have family from across the country with us today so glad they're here amen let's turn to uh if you have your Bibles let's turn to 1 Timothy chapter 4 all right let's let's uh bow our heads dear father Lord we thank you for this morning Lord thank you for this opportunity Lord when we walk in these doors just to commune with you and learn more about you Lord that you edify our souls and just touch us Lord in our personal lives and and where we need guidance Lord and where we need healing and help just pray for all the afflictions of the Saints Lord and all the the members of the body Lord who are struggling Lord just give them strength and give us strength here Lord to listen to what you have to say and that we take these words in and we really put them into our lives Lord just pray that everything that you said will be edifying just forgive us of all things Lord move us out the way as we come here to worship you in your person name of Jesus Christ I pray amen amen so 1 Timothy 4 now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils speaking lies and hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron forbidding to marry and commanding to abstain from Meats which God hath created to be received with Thanksgiving of them which believes and know the truth so here Paul is talking about you know he's realizing the need for for guidance in the church the need for you know people to have a he he's writing this to Timothy and talking about the need need of for guidance in the church and that Timothy you know he's seeing the issues and he's seeing you know what can happen when people you know don't follow the word and they don't they don't follow it closely and then they they go off so he's saying those these seducing Spirits these doctrines of devils and all these things the lies and hypocrisy and and you even see you know he pointing out doctrines that still exist today when he says you know forbidding forbidding to marry and those things and uh forbidding commanding not to eat meat and all those things and even we know today there's that uh the Catholic idea that you get married to the church and know priest can't get married and we see what the result of that is is that you know the wrongful desire that was in them wasn't cleansed out by God they were just trying to repress it through the the orders of the church and the orders of this and making things up that weren't in the Bible so you can't just repress things you have to let God cleanse those things out of you it's not a repression because when you repress things they actually come back back worse so it's not just that you know we just try really hard to do what we're supposed to do but we need to just let God cleanse those things out of us and and not be you know wooed by these these wrongful spirits and these wrong doctrines and and that's what Paul is seeing in the church and verse four every creature of God is good and nothing to be refused if it be received with Thanksgiving for it is Sanctified by the word of God and prayer if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things Thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ nourished up in the words of faith and of good Dr Doctrine whereinto thou Hast attained so this is for all of us to be good ministers I love that scripture that brother Brandon teaches on where it's you know we has made us Kings and Priests so it's not just that you know we come here and then we we you know listen to a pre preacher or Minister and then we go home and we do what we want but we have to live the life as well we have to also read we have to study ourselves and it's not that you know well the minister does this and The Minister's Wife does that but we're all Kings and Priests we're all priests and we're all supposed to you know do what we're supposed to do in verse S but refuse profane and old wives tales fables and exercise thyself rather unto godliness for bodily exercise profiteth little but godliness is profitable unto all things and having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation for therefore we both labor and suffer reproach because we trust in the Living God who is the savior of all men especially of those that believe now he's saying that bodily exercise profit little but there's many things that you know that that can be beneficial to us that might profit a little you know you can be a good businessman you can make some money but it it might profit but it would profit little and there's things you can do you can be a good person you can try and be a good neighbor but it profits little if you're not a seeking to Godliness if you're not exercising you know unto godliness and that's what we want to exercise on that's what we want to work towards in our daily lives not just you know to be upstanding citizen or upstanding person of the community but to be to exercise godliness and to following the footsteps of Jesus Christ and verse 11 these things command and teach let no man despise thy youth now that is a scripture that a lot of people stop there you they say let no man despise thy Youth and you can't judge the young people you can't say anything to us but you know no man despise thy youth but the scripture doesn't stop there so let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the Believers in word and conversation in charity in spirit in faith in Purity so it's not just that you know we we shouldn't let people despise our youth but it's also that we don't give them a reason to you know the way same way they tried to F find fault with Daniel they saw Daniel and they couldn't find fault with him so they actually had to change the rules in order to find fault with them so you know even as young people or just as Believers you know when we see other people looking at our lives and looking at how we live we want to always be you know living accordingly so that we don't get caught off guard we don't get caught you know in the wrong place in the wrong situation but we want to be living Our Lives accordingly we want to be examples in the church examples in all things so that you know when when it's our time to be be called when it's our time to be used by God that we're we're where we're supposed to be amen so and I'm sure we all want that for our young people it' be examples in the church and and and and Paul is telling this to Timothy who's maybe he doesn't want to overstep boundaries and maybe he's you know there's there's a lot of leadership and eldership in the church and he's wondering like you know maybe I'm not even like old enough to do this or whatever he's thinking but Paul is saying no you have a gift and you need to use that gift and regardless of you know your age you know God doesn't work by age he doesn't work by money he doesn't work by height he doesn't work by any of those things but he works by you know exercising yourself under godliness and if you're surrendering yourself and that's the type of you know leadership and and that we want to see in everyone as well as the young people amen and verse 13 till I come give it tendance to reading to exhortation to Doctrine neglect not the gift that is in thee which was given thee by Prophecy with the laying on of hands of the presbyter meditate upon these things give thyself holy to them that thy profiting may appear to all take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine continue in them for in doing this Thou shalt both save thyself and them and them that hear thee so and and that's a big part part of the Christian experience is that we do these things for ourselves for the edifying of ourselves but also to edify those around us and to help those around us and you see a lot of um a lot of things going around sometimes in the message and you know it's sometimes people just need uh good leadership and good examples in the church but there's also things where that we want our young people to do well and to succeed there's also things that our young people can't control and I remember I was talking to a friend and they asked me you know and there was youth camps going on and there's always you know some Youth Camp going on and and you know think it was are good and people can get experiences there but he was asking me you know what do you think the young people need the most and I thought about it and I thought you know I think what the young people need the most is surrendered parents and I think that's really Hallelujah cuz they can go to youth camps they can go to meetings they can go to all these places but if they come home in that Christian environment isn't there you know it's it's much harder to succeed it's much harder to to get through you know of course nothing is too hard for God so there's I really pray for young people who go to meetings and they they don't have believing parents and it's it's really hard for them to to stay on the right path but you know it's it's always a blessing if to have Godly Parents if young people if you have Godly Parents and and parents if you're setting that atmosphere for your children to to receive something you know and you know we see these issues with you know people always talk about the generation and the schools and and how kids are always struggling growing up and every generation has its issues but of course we know everything starts in the home and even brother Brandon was talking about how it's not always the children but sometimes it's the parents who are not you know teaching them right and raising them the right way and doing these things and they'll they'll stray off and do these things because there's not a Christian you know guid guidance and Leadership at home and that's why I love when brother Dale talks about how um we all need to when we dedicate a child we dedicate ourselves to live in front of them you know we need to be examples of the word examples of those things and you know I've talked to many people I have many friends who are in the message some who aren't you know some who were and they left and and you know the ones who left they always see it as like you know just rules they see it as rules they don't see the love and I wonder you know if maybe no one ever got to them no one ever showed them that it was the love of God and it was it was that you do these things because you love God and because of the goodness that he's done and that you know it's it's and I noticed this with the people who stay is that they see God in their parents and that's where they see him first you know it's going to be hard for your child to deny God if they're being raised by God in flesh and you so it's going to be hard for them to deny what what's right in front of them what they've been raised by what they're seeing right in front of them when they see that spirit and when they see you come home and they see you worship and there's a tape playing in the background and and you're singing to the lord it's those different things and and the main reason I can say that is because I know that the number one thing outside of God himself is the reason I'm here is because I had a Godly mother and she showed me it was her setting an example for me and her adhering to the word and not just you know going to church on Sundays but but Wednesdays you know listening on Wednesday and listening to tapes throughout the week and singing through the house and all these different things and that environment needs to be set you know and my mom doesn't know what I'm going to say when I come up here so so pray for her but um you know and and she might not even believe I'm going to say this but I'm in the Pulpit so I'm not going to lie but but I know that if I could go back in time and control who was going to raise me I would pick her because I know that she has a real experience I don't know what anyone else does at their house or what what goes on but I know that my mother has a real experience and that I know that real experience led me to Christ and I believe it will lead me to Christ again if I had to go back amen right and I think that is essential for the for the young people and I'm I'm just speaking from my own experience you know but I remember there was uh you know your family who doesn't believe this they they can get critical sometimes and I remember there was a conversation where you know it's like oh milka doesn't let those boys do anything they just go to church and back and I was I thought that's the worst thing she ever did that was I think that's pretty [Applause] good and and like I said you can't you can't deny God when you see him when you see him living in someone and if the brothers can pull up that quote from uh doors and doors that I gave him and brother Brenham talks about you know letting the Lord in your heart and he says but what but what then when Jesus comes into the heart many people accept him because they don't want to go to hell but when Jesus comes into your heart he wants to be Lord not just savior but Lord also Lord is rulership he comes in to take over now you say is that right brother Brandon sure what if I invited you at my house and you come in the door and knocked on the door and when I looked inside you said yes come on in if you can help me well you do so but now when you come in now I don't want you meddling around in my house you stand right there at the door remember our text is doors inside door now inside the human heart there's many little doors and them little doors covers up a lot of things just to let him in that isn't all of it when he comes in when I come in your house if you're welcome me at the door why you'd say come in brother brandom I'm so glad to see you I'd say well it's a privilege for me to come into your house oh won't you come over and sit down brother brandom go through our house make yourself at home oh my I'd go over to the refrigerator get me one of those great big sandwiches about like that take off my shoes and go in the bedroom and I lay down and I just have a a real gastronomical Jubilee so it's it's just letting the Lord in your heart and letting him be your ruler ERS ship and not just you know being scared cuz if there's one thing if anyone's going to know about your experience it's going to be your kids you're not going to hide anything from your kids you can come here and and pretend to us and you can pretend at work and you can pretend but at home they're going to know and that's why you invite company over and they start saying things you don't want him to say because that's the life you're living so sometimes that happens but you know we they need they need that that's why it's so important I was even talking to my uh Sunday school kids last week about how you know you being an example and you letting the Lord in your heart is going to what's what's going to edify the Saints you know there's there's we can say oh Lord don't hinder anything because of what I've done or what I what I'm doing or my life but really you just need to get that cleaned out of you so then there's no there's no issue to there to begin with there's nothing to hinder in the first place so once that's out and then you can you can be a true example to others and you know one of the um I don't I don't want to come off as too critical to parents but it's it's a it's a very important job it's a very crucial job and and one thing about it is that you know for our own personal experience when we purify ourselves it's only by the blood of God that we purify ourselves that we were saved that we come through these things and we we throw away our past life and we we accept him and we become an instrumentality of God and we fully Embrace him and make him Lord and rulership of our life we let him in those doors we let him in the house we we let him just put his feet up we let him go wherever he wants there's no door that's locked off there's no door that you know brother Randon talks about the door of Pride and your private life and the sermon and all these different things where there's a door that you kind of you know God you can come in here but oh this this little door right here that's where all the bad stuff is so I'm going to lock that door off but and like brother B said he's not going to break in he's not going to try and push his way in it's going to be you have to let him in because he's a gentleman but it's also that when when when we had faults and failures and parents in your own lives and own mistakes when you had uh you know sin and it was by the blood it was cleansed so even if sometimes you make a mistake as a parent you know that that can cover by the blood too there's nothing too hard for God there's nothing that he can't fix and and amend there's nothing that's too broken for God so just understand and trust that God is is working and and and if your child's not here then they'll be here amen because that's covered by the blood too so all your mistakes that God covered when you got saved those same mistakes will be covered as a parent and those same mistakes will be covered if you claim the blood and you watch your children walk in here amen God bless [Applause] you
