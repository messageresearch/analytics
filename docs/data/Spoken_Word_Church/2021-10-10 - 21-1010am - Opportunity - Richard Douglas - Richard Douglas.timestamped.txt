[2:09] how you need it
[2:10] and i like what brother dan daisy said
[2:12] one time he said
[2:14] he said god's ministers are like
[2:16] lifesavers
[2:17] he's got a flavor for everybody
[2:20] you know and i thought about that and i
[2:22] said well you know when i was a kid i
[2:23] liked the cherry ones but
[2:25] i never did refuse a lifesaver when they
[2:27] gave me a piece of candy
[2:29] amen
[2:30] could we turn to the reading of his word
[2:32] this morning
[2:33] turn with me to the book of matthew
[2:37] chapter 19 i want to start reading it
[2:39] verse
[2:40] 16. i want to talk this morning by the
[2:42] grace of god a little thought on
[2:43] opportunity
[2:45] i want to talk about the opportunities
[2:47] that we have and
[2:49] how we ought to
[2:51] take advantage of the opportunity we
[2:52] have to
[2:54] and the things we
[2:55] god offers us
[2:57] and we've got so many benefits that he's
[3:00] given us
[3:01] and we're thankful for his grace
[3:04] he said and behold i started verse 16 it
[3:07] says and behold one came
[3:09] and said unto him good master
[3:13] what good
[3:15] thing shall i
[3:17] shall i do
[3:19] that i may have eternal life
[3:22] wrong question
[3:25] what good thing shall i do
[3:29] it says and he said
[3:30] unto him why call us thou me good there
[3:34] is none good but one that is god
[3:37] but if thou wilt enter into life keep
[3:40] the commandments
[3:42] and he saith unto him
[3:44] which
[3:45] jesus
[3:46] said
[3:47] thou shalt do no murder
[3:49] thou shalt not commit adultery thou
[3:51] shalt not steal
[3:53] thou shalt not bear false witness
[3:55] honor thy father and thy mother
[3:58] and thou shalt love thy
[4:00] neighbor as thyself
[4:02] and the young ruler saith unto him all
[4:05] these things have i kept from my youth
[4:08] up
[4:09] what lack i yet
[4:11] jesus said unto him if thou wilt be
[4:15] perfect go and sell
[4:17] that thou hast and give to the poor
[4:20] and thou
[4:22] shalt have treasure in heaven and come
[4:24] and follow me
[4:26] and when the young man heard that saying
[4:30] he went away sorrowful for he had great
[4:33] possessions
[4:34] then said jesus unto his disciples
[4:36] verily verily i say unto you
[4:39] that a rich man shall hardly enter into
[4:41] the kingdom of heaven
[4:43] and again i say unto you it is easier
[4:46] for a camel to go through the eye of a
[4:48] needle than a rich man to enter into the
[4:51] kingdom of god
[4:53] father
[4:54] lord jesus there's only one way
[4:58] father and that's you
[4:59] and father we're standing at the door
[5:01] this morning lord you
[5:03] and i'm asking you to let me enter in
[5:05] that door lord
[5:06] enter in that door that you the people
[5:08] will not see me but they'll see you lord
[5:11] father i'm asking that you'd come lord
[5:13] and anoint me lord you take control of
[5:15] my mind you take control of my spirit
[5:18] lord you take control of my mouth lord i
[5:21] give myself completely to you lord that
[5:23] you might lord have preeminence lord in
[5:26] this service this morning oh god i don't
[5:29] want to make a mistake
[5:31] with this opportunity we have this
[5:33] morning lord
[5:34] father i pray lord god that you just
[5:36] used me in a mighty way that you speak
[5:38] lip to ear to your children
[5:40] father we ask you to do these things
[5:41] lord in the name of jesus christ our
[5:43] savior amen and amen you may be seated
[5:48] we see here that this
[5:50] the rich young ruler he had a had a
[5:52] great desire
[5:53] he knew within himself that there
[5:56] that there was a way to have eternal
[5:59] life
[6:00] but he thought it was
[6:01] in his own way of thinking i believe
[6:03] what he thought by his own thinking was
[6:05] the way he asked this question
[6:07] what must i do
[6:09] what must i do what can i do to
[6:12] and he he asked that question and what
[6:15] he needed to do was ask the lord
[6:18] what
[6:19] what would you have me do
[6:21] not what i can do but what would you
[6:23] have me to do you give me he come to the
[6:26] opportunity of life
[6:28] and to eternal life and he walked away
[6:31] you know
[6:32] we look at that many times and look at
[6:34] it as that way but look at the many
[6:36] times people have come
[6:38] to jesus come to this message which i
[6:40] believe this message is nothing more
[6:42] than jesus christ have come to this
[6:44] message had the opportunity to have
[6:47] eternal life and to go in the rapture
[6:49] and turn to walk the way because it was
[6:52] too hard for them the questions he asked
[6:54] for them to do
[6:56] but i've now and then you talk to many
[6:58] people and they say you know the one
[7:00] thing about they try to say about the
[7:01] message it's such a hard thing it's
[7:04] it's so many do's and don'ts but when i
[7:07] come to this message i've never seen it
[7:09] never
[7:10] made me feel that way brother samuel it
[7:12] was a doing it don't it was a want to
[7:15] when you fall in love with jesus christ
[7:17] it's no longer you do or dawn as you
[7:19] want to
[7:21] he took away my want to to do the things
[7:23] of the world and put a desire in me to
[7:25] want to serve him and to praise him and
[7:28] to give him all adoration and all love
[7:30] and everything i could give him because
[7:33] he gave me an opportunity
[7:35] it gave me an opportunity in this hour
[7:37] when the world's falling apart
[7:39] everything's going haywire he said i've
[7:42] given you the opportunity i've give you
[7:44] a place i've given you a city of refuge
[7:48] that you can run there and be saved
[7:50] david said he is my refuge i can run
[7:53] he's my tower he's the rock and the
[7:56] cleft he's everything i can run into him
[7:59] and i can be saved that's the only saved
[8:02] pavilion we have in this hour god has
[8:04] given us this opportunity to come into
[8:06] him and to be perfect we are perfect in
[8:09] christ
[8:10] we are he made us perfect through his
[8:12] word he sent us a perfect word what do
[8:15] we do with this word that he's given us
[8:17] i like what brother brown preached a
[8:19] message what shall we do with this one
[8:21] name christ you know you know brother
[8:23] brown said every time we come to church
[8:26] we have the opportunity like we are in
[8:28] pilates hall to either receive the word
[8:31] of god that you're hearing or to reject
[8:34] it
[8:35] and i'm thankful that god is placed
[8:37] we'll be so thankful for the opportunity
[8:40] that he's given us the heart to receive
[8:42] the word of god to have a receiving
[8:45] heart to accept it and say god lord i
[8:48] can't figure i can't explain everything
[8:51] i can't figure everything out but oh god
[8:53] there's something on the inside of the
[8:55] inside that says that's nothing but the
[8:58] truth that is nothing but the truth
[9:01] that's what this message did when it
[9:02] come to me it proved to me that jesus
[9:05] christ is the same yesterday today and
[9:08] forever
[9:10] the unchangeable god what is the
[9:12] opportunity
[9:13] it's a set of circumstances that makes
[9:16] it possible to do something see this man
[9:19] had oh my god
[9:21] he had an opportunity he had the same
[9:24] opportunity that me and you had he come
[9:27] right up to life
[9:28] come right up to eternal life and he
[9:30] said he he's seen that what it was he'd
[9:33] even and said i've done all these
[9:34] commandments i've kept them i've held
[9:37] them i've done this and i couldn't even
[9:39] say i can't even say that in my life
[9:41] i've not kept all the commandments from
[9:43] my youth but you know what he said my
[9:46] grace the blood this opportunity i'm
[9:49] going to give you an opportunity even
[9:51] when you failed and you made a mistake
[9:52] i'm going even though your sins be as
[9:55] scarlet i'll make them white as snow if
[9:57] you'll accept my propitiation for your
[10:00] sins
[10:03] what an opportunity to become spotless
[10:06] without a wrinkle without a blemish
[10:09] that's what this message come to do is
[10:11] to prepare a bride for a rapture
[10:16] and i believe it's doing just exactly
[10:19] what it said it would do
[10:21] problems said how does god
[10:24] how does god fulfill his word he brings
[10:26] it to pass
[10:28] you are you are what he has spoken of
[10:31] this morning you are that
[10:33] lady you're his wife you're the one that
[10:35] he has chose to carry the cross in this
[10:38] age
[10:40] and i don't want it
[10:42] half hardly
[10:43] i don't want to take it for granted
[10:45] i don't want to just
[10:47] slip in as people would say get in by
[10:49] the skin of my teeth
[10:51] i want to go in shouting i want to go in
[10:54] and sing and i want to go in praising i
[10:57] want to go in with the victory saying
[10:58] god you have caused me to be triumphant
[11:02] in this age
[11:03] god has given us the opportunity in this
[11:06] age
[11:07] to flourish
[11:10] because he has sent us light
[11:12] in the evening time
[11:15] and the light is what is bringing forth
[11:17] the maturity of his wife
[11:20] the word of god
[11:22] you were to think that when he you were
[11:24] to think that was a good thing that he
[11:26] was said
[11:27] when the rich young ruler told him
[11:29] he said i've done these things i've kept
[11:31] them from my youth you would have looked
[11:33] at the outward appearance and think well
[11:35] he's
[11:36] he's done all these things
[11:38] he he expected something
[11:41] a different response
[11:43] from jesus christ than what he got
[11:46] he expected him to pat him on the back
[11:48] and tell him you're a good old fellow
[11:51] you're going to make it
[11:53] because of works you've done
[11:55] but what he was telling him it's not the
[11:57] works that you've done
[11:58] it's the works that i'm finishing
[12:01] you're going to go because of me
[12:03] and if you'll obey me
[12:05] and it's a paradox because he give us
[12:07] faith to believe this message brother
[12:09] donny and then rewards us for believing
[12:13] this you talk about a package deal what
[12:16] a package deal we have in jesus christ
[12:19] what a package we have in this message
[12:23] it's eternal
[12:25] see we why satan is fighting us and
[12:28] against us because we don't have an
[12:30] expiration date and he does
[12:33] his time is expiring
[12:36] he is siren right now
[12:39] he is going to the lake of fire his time
[12:42] is done with it
[12:44] he's given him the most power he's ever
[12:47] had but the bride of jesus christ is
[12:50] still standing because of the
[12:52] opportunity she has received through
[12:55] this message
[12:58] oh hallelujah
[13:00] what a privilege
[13:02] he missed his chance
[13:05] many are missing their chance
[13:09] missing their chance or opportunity
[13:12] to receive
[13:14] life
[13:16] because he had great possessions
[13:18] my goodness
[13:20] what is great possessions here brother
[13:22] and says it's all going to be atomic
[13:24] father
[13:26] he's showing us he's warning us through
[13:28] this that whatever is between me and you
[13:31] and god will hinder us from going any
[13:33] further
[13:36] that's why he is allowing us to see
[13:38] these things in the scriptures what an
[13:40] opportunity
[13:42] that's why paul said lay aside every
[13:45] weight that so easily beset us
[13:47] and let us run this race with patience
[13:52] oh my it's not to the swift
[13:54] it's not to the strong it's to them that
[13:57] endure to the end shall be saved
[13:59] and he has given us
[14:01] enduring power when we have received the
[14:03] baptism of the holy spirit we will
[14:05] endure to the end satan has taken the
[14:08] most of his opportunity
[14:11] he said how
[14:12] set in the synagogues of god
[14:14] and be worshipped as god he's done it
[14:18] he said i'll be exalted
[14:20] and he's done it
[14:22] but what about the bride she's doing
[14:24] just what god said she would do she'll
[14:26] stand on the word of god and shall not
[14:29] move except for thus saith the lord
[14:33] he said my sheep know my voice
[14:36] and a stranger they won't follow
[14:39] what an opportunity to hear his voice
[14:42] with all the voices in the world of
[14:44] politics and this voice and that voice
[14:47] and these things
[14:48] but that still small voice
[14:51] look at the opportunity elijah had
[14:55] the thunder
[14:57] didn't move him
[14:58] the lightning didn't move him
[15:01] the rain didn't move him but when that
[15:03] still small voice spoke
[15:06] he recognized it and come out
[15:08] he said i've got the opportunity
[15:11] the master calleth me
[15:13] oh hallelujah
[15:15] brother brown said many move at the
[15:16] thunder
[15:17] many move at the lightning
[15:19] many and move in the rain he said but
[15:21] the thing is is to move when the voice
[15:24] of god speaks
[15:26] what i believe is the failure a lot of
[15:29] times around the message is the failure
[15:31] to see the voice
[15:33] of the son
[15:35] the opportunity of the voice that he has
[15:37] given us in this hour
[15:38] to receive his voice
[15:41] and to know who it was speaking
[15:44] a lot of people said i i heard
[15:46] i like what brother brown said said one
[15:48] man was listening to his tape and he
[15:50] said he called me a buzzard the other
[15:52] man said he called me an eagle
[15:56] that's what this rich young ruler found
[15:58] out he called me a buzzer because i
[16:00] failed to obey the full word of god
[16:04] he said sell all you have
[16:06] give to the poor pick up your cross and
[16:09] follow jesus what an opportunity
[16:12] for god to give you what is this what in
[16:15] this world is worth that
[16:17] well
[16:18] how can you buy it
[16:21] where can you go get it
[16:23] there's only one place and that's jesus
[16:25] christ
[16:26] and he stood right there at the
[16:27] opportunity right there at the door
[16:30] and the door was oh hallelujah glory to
[16:33] god the door was open
[16:35] inviting him to come
[16:38] he says too hard
[16:39] too hard for me
[16:41] it's a hard thing
[16:43] that's what many have found out they
[16:45] said it's too hard
[16:46] but i said oh my
[16:48] jesus when i fell in love with you you
[16:52] made it easy even through the hard times
[16:55] i can still say thank you lord for all
[16:58] you've done
[17:01] your grace has been sufficient for me
[17:05] oh hallelujah
[17:07] even when that when that minister of
[17:09] satan buffeted
[17:11] paul
[17:12] blow after blow after blow he had the
[17:15] opportunity to just say it's too much
[17:18] i can't take it
[17:20] i'm going to throw the towel in
[17:22] but what he'd received was more than the
[17:25] pressure that was coming upon him
[17:28] he'd received a tie post
[17:30] he'd received
[17:32] jesus christ as his savior
[17:35] and the lord gave him the answer
[17:38] he said my grace
[17:40] is sufficient that's what he's telling
[17:42] us through this pandemic and all these
[17:44] things he's telling you my grace
[17:47] is sufficient
[17:49] my mercies are new you know yesterday
[17:52] you may have thought maybe
[17:54] brother bob that you'd wore it out it
[17:55] was over with everything was gone it's
[17:58] no hope
[17:59] but he said
[18:00] they're new this morning all right i'll
[18:02] give you a brand new set of mercy i'll
[18:05] give you the opportunity to stand again
[18:10] oh hallelujah ain't you thankful for the
[18:12] grace of god
[18:13] and she's thankful for the message he's
[18:15] given us
[18:18] oh
[18:19] what a mighty god we serve
[18:22] he tells us
[18:23] what amazes me
[18:25] is that here
[18:27] satan and god
[18:30] have a conversation
[18:32] and they begin to talk about this man
[18:34] named job
[18:35] this man named job said there's none
[18:37] like him
[18:38] none like him brother sam nothing like
[18:40] him in all the world have you considered
[18:42] him oh yeah
[18:44] i've been looking at him a long time
[18:47] you know he's flourished prospered his
[18:50] health's good everything's going good i
[18:53] can't touch him you got a hedge around
[18:56] him
[18:57] he said but if you'll let me touch him
[18:59] i'll make him curse you
[19:02] he said then do
[19:04] whatever you got to do but don't take
[19:06] his life
[19:08] because i have the power
[19:10] of life and death
[19:13] and what amazes me is here this comes on
[19:16] joe
[19:17] here's a and here here is this
[19:19] opportunity oh my god gives us
[19:21] opportunities to glorify himself
[19:24] he said you
[19:25] here he is do what you want to with him
[19:28] he knew that what job had would hold him
[19:33] he already knew satan said no
[19:35] if i take away all of his worldly goods
[19:38] and all of his health and his family
[19:40] he's bound to curse him
[19:44] but i like when the when the man come
[19:46] running and they started telling him
[19:47] your children are dead your camel's is
[19:50] gone this is gone all that's gone you
[19:53] know he never
[19:54] you know what he did it amazes me he
[19:57] fell on his face
[19:59] and he worshiped god
[20:01] he said this is my opportunity to praise
[20:05] god for his love and mercy for me
[20:10] and look at the words that come out of
[20:11] his mouth
[20:12] he said the lord giveth and the lord
[20:16] taketh away
[20:17] blessed be the name of the lord
[20:20] in a time of giving and taking he still
[20:23] blessed god
[20:26] no matter what comes upon us
[20:28] we have the opportunity to say
[20:30] blessed be the name of the lord
[20:32] thank you lord
[20:34] thank you for all you've done for me
[20:36] thank you for your hand of mercy thank
[20:38] you for my family thank you for my
[20:40] church thank you for my pastor thank you
[20:43] for jesus
[20:47] oh hallelujah
[20:49] i've got so much
[20:51] what an opportunity to praise him
[20:53] david was not a man you had to pump up
[20:55] to get him to come to church
[20:58] he said i was glad when they said
[21:01] unto me
[21:03] he was already
[21:05] primed for the pumping
[21:07] you know what that's that's the
[21:08] opportunity we had this morning when we
[21:11] come to church are we already primed for
[21:14] the pumping a lot of times we want the
[21:16] preacher to pump us up but we've put no
[21:18] water we've not struck water in the
[21:21] whale yet
[21:22] so it makes it hard on the man to pump a
[21:25] dry whale
[21:28] but people that's been praying and
[21:30] reading their bible and studying and
[21:32] come with the joy of the lord excited
[21:35] about the word of god saying this is my
[21:37] opportunity to thank you jesus to
[21:40] worship you to praise you for your grace
[21:43] and mercy
[21:44] [Applause]
[21:48] and it just flows smooth
[21:50] you know what it's not all about what he
[21:52] does for us he may have come this oh my
[21:55] glory be he might have come this morning
[21:57] brother sam wanting to drink from your
[21:59] life
[22:02] he might want to drink from your whale
[22:04] this morning
[22:05] i'd hate for him to walk up and find no
[22:07] water of joy no water of peace
[22:10] no water of love
[22:12] no water satisfaction
[22:16] he said oh i remember david the desire
[22:19] of him
[22:21] said if i could just get a drink from
[22:23] that whale in my seba and his and they
[22:27] didn't commission his soldiers to do
[22:29] that
[22:30] and they fought through all those
[22:31] philistines to get down there to get him
[22:34] a drink because it was the opportunity
[22:37] for them to come and bless the king oh
[22:40] my
[22:41] oh if you come this morning to bless the
[22:43] king
[22:44] have you come to offer him a sacrifice
[22:46] of praise and worship and honor what an
[22:50] opportunity you know what we're losing
[22:52] our opportunities
[22:54] there'll be no excuse for us
[22:57] this is just this brother says go come
[22:59] to a place brother said this will be but
[23:01] just a fond memory they'll shut the
[23:03] doors
[23:05] why not take advantage of the
[23:06] opportunity now to get what god has for
[23:09] us
[23:10] we don't have to come we don't have to
[23:12] leave empty
[23:14] we can leave full
[23:15] and if we come full of the world this is
[23:18] our opportunity to empty so he can fill
[23:20] us
[23:23] oh hallelujah
[23:26] we see
[23:27] that
[23:28] what brought
[23:30] jesus on the scene after the look like
[23:32] everything he taught and everything he'd
[23:35] it fell apart and all these things was
[23:38] happening and
[23:40] he'd been crucified and he'd been in the
[23:42] grave for those three days and looked
[23:44] like it was all over and here was two
[23:46] men walking back defeated brother
[23:49] look like you know what looked like the
[23:51] message had failed them
[23:53] huh look like everything they thought it
[23:55] failed them
[23:56] but you know what what brought him on
[23:58] the scene is they begin to talk about
[24:00] him
[24:01] that's our problem we don't talk about
[24:03] him we have an opportunity every day to
[24:07] witness about jesus christ
[24:09] and when i wake up i say oh god
[24:11] who can i witness to this morning
[24:14] who can i speak to lord who would you
[24:17] have me
[24:18] tell about you today
[24:21] you know what brother they said brother
[24:22] braham every time he never missed his
[24:24] opportunity to glorify god to tell
[24:27] people about his savior
[24:30] he said we shouldn't be ashamed
[24:33] what a privilege that he would call us
[24:36] sons and daughters of the living god
[24:39] what an opportunity we have
[24:41] as sons and daughters of god
[24:44] some people are looking for a jesus with
[24:47] skin on him you might be that very one
[24:50] that can get that last one to come home
[24:52] to jesus
[24:53] look at the opportunity we have let us
[24:56] not shine our
[24:57] our our position in christ but they
[25:00] begin to talk about him in their broken
[25:03] down way you know what have you ever
[25:05] been discouraged or going through this
[25:07] battle and you start listening to a tape
[25:09] or start talking or praying or thinking
[25:12] about jesus and here he comes
[25:16] that's why he said i'll never leave you
[25:18] i'll never forsake you i'll even be with
[25:20] you even in you to the end
[25:23] and what did he do he didn't just come
[25:24] and tell him
[25:25] who he was right off he began to take
[25:28] him to the scriptures
[25:30] he began to take them to the scriptures
[25:32] and he began to tell them did not these
[25:34] things supposed to have been was there
[25:37] not supposed to be a sacrifice given for
[25:40] the sins of man was not he supposed to
[25:43] do these things
[25:44] and he just they got to their house and
[25:47] you know what a lot of times we are in
[25:48] church and he's talking to his men and
[25:51] you know what we get to the house and
[25:52] we're heading home and he's still
[25:54] missing to us and we don't constrain him
[25:57] just come on in the house with me lord
[26:00] don't go on down the road i don't want
[26:02] to leave you
[26:04] i don't want you to leave me lord i want
[26:06] you to and they said they constrained
[26:08] him
[26:09] to come in
[26:11] and fellowship with him
[26:13] and as he be and as he began
[26:16] they asked him to break break oh
[26:18] hallelujah
[26:19] communion with him and you know what
[26:22] they said and he'd done something
[26:24] and they knew it was him brother donnie
[26:27] i believe he was breaking that bread and
[26:29] it just become a whole loaf again and he
[26:31] broke it again and it was still a whole
[26:33] loaf and he broke it again they said
[26:35] it's him
[26:36] it's him it's the master he's alive
[26:43] and that's what the prophet said he said
[26:45] you'll know when god is speaking through
[26:47] a man by the way he breaks the bread the
[26:51] way god uses him to break the bread
[26:52] you'll recognize it's not man speaking
[26:55] but it's god speaking through a man
[26:58] they didn't miss their opportunity they
[27:01] went back and said
[27:02] look he's alive we've seen him
[27:06] he's not dead
[27:09] oh hallelujah
[27:11] what an opportunity
[27:12] we have this morning
[27:14] to glorify god
[27:16] to worship him in spirit and truth to
[27:19] thank him for his gracious
[27:21] love and mercy
[27:23] first thessalonians 5 21 says prove all
[27:26] things
[27:27] hold fast to that which is good
[27:30] i tell you what when god
[27:32] showed me this message i seen more than
[27:35] a man
[27:37] i seen god speaking through a man
[27:40] i seen god ministering to my soul i
[27:43] heard more than a man's voice
[27:46] i didn't hey i heard jesus christ
[27:49] speaking to my soul
[27:51] he said come and abide with me
[27:54] oh and hallelujah once i went into this
[27:57] pavilion this
[27:59] this refuge of jesus christ i've never
[28:01] wanted to look back never wanted to go
[28:04] out i even when when you do people don't
[28:07] understand the slayer is still outside
[28:11] you're still guilty without the
[28:13] atonement
[28:15] the avenger of the blood still desires
[28:17] to kill you
[28:19] to take your life and he has the right
[28:21] to do it that's what happened to eve
[28:24] reverend said she stepped out from
[28:25] behind the protection of the word
[28:28] you're no match for him
[28:30] get it out of your mind
[28:33] you're not the champion
[28:35] jesus is the champion
[28:37] he's undefeated
[28:42] and i'm glad he set refuge for me and
[28:45] you to come into
[28:47] and i hear that
[28:48] i'm not listening to joab's messengers
[28:52] that's what happened to abandoner
[28:54] is they started he had uh he was safe
[28:57] abner was in the city of refuge and joab
[29:00] could do nothing to him
[29:02] even though he had killed his brother
[29:04] and he had the right to avenge his
[29:05] brother but he was in the city if he
[29:07] were to stay there he could not have got
[29:10] him
[29:11] but he sent messengers in that's what
[29:13] satan's tried to do in this message send
[29:15] messengers in
[29:18] he's satan's trying to take the most of
[29:19] his opportunity he sent messengers in he
[29:22] said come on out johanna wants to talk
[29:24] to you he said forget all that we're
[29:26] friends let's make a covenant
[29:28] let's be let's be friends
[29:31] that's what
[29:32] satan is not your friend
[29:35] he still hates you
[29:38] and he listened to him
[29:40] he listened to him brother cairo he
[29:43] listened to him and he went outside
[29:47] and there he was
[29:49] the slayer
[29:50] joe had killed him and the bible said
[29:54] that abner died as one of the foolish
[29:56] men of israel because he stepped outside
[29:59] the protection
[30:02] you don't think when you step up from us
[30:04] from behind this message that you're
[30:06] going to see the avenger of the blood
[30:09] i hear him all the time calling come on

[32:10] to turn back
[32:12] now i said i see
[32:15] nowhere to go i have no bridge to go
[32:17] back across
[32:18] he'd burn it

[32:22] he didn't even give me a towel to throw
[32:24] in
[32:26] thank god
[32:27] that he didn't give us a towel to throw
[32:29] in he said he who has begun a good work
[32:33] will finish him
[32:35] and i said lord
[32:37] thank you for that and when satan tries
[32:39] to battle me with my health and
[32:41] different things i said satan i'm a work
[32:44] in progress
[32:47] i said i'm he's working his perfection
[32:50] through me
[32:52] he's showing that there's going to be a
[32:54] bride in this age i don't care who walks
[32:57] away who turns back by god's grace i'm
[33:00] here to stay
[33:03] i'm here for the end duration of it all
[33:06] i'm gonna whether they take my life
[33:08] whatever they do they shut the doors i'm
[33:11] still gonna press the battle i'm still
[33:14] gonna believe
[33:15] what if they take everything you got i
[33:17] don't have nothing
[33:19] when you give your life to christ you
[33:20] have nothing
[33:22] i like what the one the one of the
[33:24] fellows in the fox's book of martyrs
[33:26] said when they went and rung him before
[33:27] the king and they told it said they
[33:29] brought him the king and the king he
[33:31] told the king the king said what if i
[33:34] he said i i have the power to take your
[33:36] life he said if you don't denounce the
[33:38] name of jesus i'll take your life he
[33:40] said o king
[33:42] i died years ago
[33:45] it stunned him
[33:47] because god always he said take no
[33:49] thought what to say in that day
[33:51] he said i'm already dead
[33:55] we got to be that dead
[33:57] we got to be that dead and say hey
[33:59] what is this man he's giving me nothing
[34:01] but trouble it'll be an honor to lay my
[34:04] life down for the king
[34:06] he laid his life down for a sinner like
[34:09] me
[34:11] what an opportunity if that's what he
[34:13] desired for me to lay my life down for
[34:15] him
[34:16] that don't scare me
[34:17] death don't scare me
[34:19] i'm not afraid of death
[34:21] it's just a cart i told a brother the
[34:23] other day i said if death would take me
[34:26] i said i'll have the whip and i'll beat
[34:27] satan all the way across the river to
[34:29] jordan i'll say let's go boy i'm going
[34:32] home
[34:37] he has no power over a believer
[34:40] we don't die
[34:43] we go in
[34:44] to god's glory
[34:47] he said well what if i take everything
[34:49] you own
[34:50] he said oh king
[34:52] i don't know nothing i give it all to
[34:55] jesus
[34:56] stunned the king i could just see his
[34:58] look man this guy's dead and he has
[35:00] nothing he looked over to his advisor
[35:02] and said what do you do
[35:04] with a man that's dead and has nothing
[35:06] he said let him go
[35:10] yeah brother brown said you can't you
[35:12] can you can do whatever you want to at
[35:13] the dead man they want you smack him
[35:16] kick him
[35:17] he don't care
[35:19] he just lays there
[35:20] see that's where we got to come to we
[35:22] this message
[35:24] is give us the opportunity to crucify
[35:27] the flesh
[35:28] to die to our own ways of thinking in
[35:31] our own ideas
[35:34] it's given it's given me the opportunity
[35:36] for richard douglas to die
[35:39] that god might live
[35:42] and what we don't realize is the
[35:43] opportunity he's given us he said he
[35:45] hath delivered me
[35:47] from the power of darkness
[35:50] in jehovah he just didn't deliver me
[35:52] from the power of darkness brothers and
[35:53] sisters but into
[35:55] his glorious life
[35:57] and i'm always telling him satan come on
[35:59] come on across the blood
[36:01] come on
[36:02] he can't do it
[36:04] if he did he'd be your brother
[36:08] he can't come into the light because
[36:10] when the lights flashed on him he's like
[36:12] a cockroach he scatters
[36:15] he's like oh my
[36:18] see we're supposed to be such a
[36:19] reflection of jesus christ
[36:21] when this light of god hits us we're
[36:24] supposed to reflect back jesus
[36:26] and when satan says that he's like
[36:29] my
[36:30] that ain't donny that's christ
[36:34] it's like putting a cross before a
[36:35] vampire
[36:38] if there was
[36:43] but there's a lot of
[36:45] spiritual vampires
[36:47] around the message trying to suck
[36:50] your faith out of you
[36:52] and suck your experience with christ out
[36:54] of you
[36:55] trying to get you to pull away
[36:58] pull away
[36:59] pull away people always saying it's so
[37:01] hard it's so hard
[37:03] i always like taking to the scripture he
[37:04] said my commandments
[37:06] are not grievous
[37:10] oh it ain't been the grievous walk for
[37:12] me it's been a joy has it been a hard
[37:14] walk oh yes
[37:16] it's been tough
[37:18] but you know what his grace has been
[37:20] sufficient for every mile
[37:24] [Applause]
[37:28] you know what we've talked about it
[37:30] we've listened to it we've
[37:32] believed it the prophet's talked about
[37:34] it and told us about but you know what i
[37:36] can see the finish line
[37:38] i can say satan if i have to crawl or
[37:42] roll across the line i'm coming
[37:45] you better get out of my way
[37:49] i'm determined
[37:50] with the opportunity god has given me
[37:53] paul said press toward the mark of the
[37:55] high calling
[37:56] he said you'll have to fight for
[37:57] everything you've got
[38:00] what a privilege it is to fight for
[38:01] truth
[38:02] what an honor it is to stand for the
[38:05] living god
[38:07] oh
[38:08] we could have quit
[38:09] we could walk away we could do all those
[38:11] things
[38:13] but what virtue does it have in it
[38:17] you know what satan would not be
[38:19] battling you if you was a loser like he
[38:21] tells you
[38:23] because satan
[38:24] you know
[38:25] nobody
[38:26] wants
[38:27] to be like a loser
[38:30] so why do you think satan wants to be
[38:32] like you
[38:33] because you're a winner and you have the
[38:35] power to create
[38:37] and he cannot stand it because creative
[38:40] power lives within us
[38:42] [Music]
[38:43] oh hallelujah
[38:45] ain't you thankful for the grace of god
[38:47] look at what the prophet of god said
[38:50] in the message experiences
[38:52] he said and he said brother branham
[38:54] she's only
[38:56] only one in the bunch that's a christian
[38:57] he said i guess
[38:59] that we're just too mean said that's the
[39:02] reason she's
[39:04] god's taking her from us
[39:06] because we're not christians and i've
[39:07] seen
[39:08] the opportunity that god had given me
[39:11] he said don't
[39:12] ever fail
[39:14] your opportunity
[39:18] he was like he was discouraged the man
[39:20] that god was taking away this sister and
[39:24] all this but he he said
[39:26] don't let me fail to tell you look
[39:27] that's not the end of the story
[39:30] that
[39:31] the grave is not the end of it that's
[39:33] not the end of the christian job had to
[39:36] go through all those things to see and
[39:38] know that my redeemer
[39:40] liveth
[39:42] he said don't fail your opportunities
[39:45] brothers and sisters let's not fail our
[39:47] opportunities we have
[39:50] people are wanting something real and i
[39:52] tell you jesus is the only real thing
[39:55] there is
[39:58] witnesses he said when god appears he
[40:01] usually appears in fire
[40:03] and they rush to the prophet
[40:05] to consume them
[40:07] hungry lines
[40:09] said they saw the fire around the
[40:11] prophet they stood there
[40:13] in the distance he said and then daniel
[40:15] in his trueness of witness of the living
[40:18] god gave testimony the next morning that
[40:21] there is a true and living god who can
[40:24] deliver from the lion's den he testified
[40:27] of it he gave him the opportunity
[40:30] he proved
[40:32] out a hundred percent
[40:35] he gave him the opportunity to glorify
[40:38] god i trusted him they didn't eat me
[40:41] there was a pillow
[40:43] to my head
[40:45] think about that they thought that that
[40:47] was going to be the end of daniel satan
[40:50] thought when all this happened that'll
[40:52] be the enterprise she'll quit she'll
[40:53] never come back i'll put fear on her she
[40:56] won't come back to church no more
[40:59] wrong
[41:01] wrong answer
[41:03] because we believe the scripture the
[41:04] bible says forsake not yourself
[41:07] descending yourselves together even more
[41:09] so as the days draw near
[41:12] we come together for what one reason to
[41:14] see jesus christ
[41:16] manifested through his word
[41:19] we have the opportunity to say we're not
[41:21] going to back down
[41:23] we're not going to bow look at the three
[41:25] hebrew children look at the opportunity
[41:27] they had
[41:28] there was hey there was that was not the
[41:30] only that was on not the only israelites
[41:33] in
[41:34] not the only israelites in babylon
[41:37] but that was the three that made the
[41:39] most of their opportunity
[41:41] huh when they blow their horn and sound
[41:44] the temples do all these things they
[41:45] wasn't bound to daniel
[41:47] when they say brother bram's god i'm not
[41:49] going to bow
[41:50] you say he's a prophet of god revealing
[41:52] god i said amen
[41:54] i'll bow to jesus christ and him alone i
[41:56] give my lies to christ and i've never
[41:58] changed my mind
[42:03] he had the opportunity to glorify god
[42:06] they said if you don't bow you're going
[42:08] in the fire
[42:10] he said whole king
[42:12] our god is more than able to deliver us
[42:15] from the fire
[42:17] but
[42:18] if he don't
[42:20] we still
[42:21] won't bow
[42:25] he's more than able to deliver us from
[42:27] any of our problems but if he don't i
[42:30] still will not bow to my circumstances
[42:34] i will not bow to my trial
[42:37] i will not back down from what god has
[42:40] given me
[42:41] i refuse
[42:42] to give up my rights
[42:45] i have the opportunity to stand in this
[42:47] age you have the opportunity to stand
[42:49] what a privilege it is to stand for a
[42:51] true and a living god
[42:53] what a gracious hour we live in
[42:57] will not bend
[42:58] will not bow
[43:00] will not burn
[43:03] and in they went
[43:05] but it didn't burn them
[43:06] and they didn't bow
[43:08] but it brung
[43:09] the voice of the sign
[43:12] they said behold i see a fourth man
[43:15] in the fire
[43:17] satan's seeing all this that he's doing
[43:19] to the bride and he's saying
[43:20] wow i threw him in
[43:22] but i see the fourth man
[43:24] and the fire
[43:26] they're not being consumed by this these
[43:28] circumstances do you know what brother
[43:30] brown said god gave you faith to master
[43:33] faith is a master of all your
[43:35] circumstances
[43:37] faith
[43:39] then god will master any situation in
[43:42] your life he said well brother you don't
[43:43] look like he's doing no better praise
[43:45] god i'm better
[43:47] i don't care what the devil says
[43:50] he don't tell he never told me the truth
[43:52] before you think he took true serum now
[43:56] the bible says he's a liar
[43:58] and the father of lies
[44:00] the truth's not in him are we going to
[44:01] believe his report or god's report
[44:05] are we going to be
[44:06] like oh
[44:08] are we going to be just say well
[44:10] i guess i ain't going to make it
[44:13] well you ain't if you don't think you're
[44:15] going you ain't going
[44:18] you know what i'm saying i said i'm
[44:19] going to make it
[44:20] in spite of myself
[44:22] because he started this he's going to
[44:25] finish it
[44:26] hallelujah
[44:28] he proved it to him
[44:29] that god
[44:31] that the god that daniel served and the
[44:33] god that shadrach meshach and
[44:35] sir was the true and living god
[44:37] he's the true god
[44:39] true god none like him
[44:42] even even even nebuchadnezzar said
[44:45] he serves as true in the living god
[44:48] we see
[44:49] the voice of the sign
[44:51] oh hallelujah have we not seen the voice
[44:54] of the sign
[44:55] the sign
[44:57] the voice is backed up
[44:59] what god has showed us in this day
[45:01] look in the message the unwelcome christ
[45:03] i'm fixing to close here
[45:05] it says
[45:07] pharisee simeon the pharisee was too
[45:09] busy cracking jokes with dr jones and
[45:12] all of them he didn't have time he let
[45:16] jesus slip
[45:17] and get in
[45:19] and that flunky let him slip by oh my
[45:22] i wish i could have took that flunky's
[45:25] place
[45:26] an opportunity to wash jesus's feet
[45:31] he said in and to anoint him
[45:34] and made him welcome he said that's the
[45:36] way it is
[45:38] he invited him and then he didn't
[45:41] make him welcome
[45:43] i'd hate to think we invited god into
[45:46] this service this morning and we didn't
[45:48] even make it well
[45:50] we didn't even make him welcome by the
[45:52] joy that we have for what he's done for
[45:54] us
[45:55] what an opportunity
[45:57] that he had
[45:59] he invited him i like what brother
[46:01] brandt said he said jesus
[46:03] always keeps all his appointments
[46:06] just invite him
[46:08] just invite him into your
[46:11] troubles
[46:12] invite him into your heartaches
[46:15] invite him into your situations
[46:18] he'll change it
[46:19] he'll change everything

[46:23] bishop he said
[46:25] brother eddie every time he comes
[46:28] something good happens
[46:31] so i want him to come
[46:33] i want him to walk
[46:35] i'm not going to miss if he wants to
[46:37] move
[46:38] and i start crying i want to cry enough
[46:41] to wash his feet
[46:43] i don't want to care about what i look
[46:44] like to everybody else i don't care what
[46:47] nobody else thinks about me i just want
[46:49] to make his feet
[46:50] clean
[46:52] and if he wants me to anoint him with
[46:54] the joy of gladness i want to be the
[46:56] first one to give him my best
[47:00] i've never desired to be the best the
[47:03] best preacher
