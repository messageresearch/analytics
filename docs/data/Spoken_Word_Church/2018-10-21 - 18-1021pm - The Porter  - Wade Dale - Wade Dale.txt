application I lost it and so we printed out another one thankfully my teacher was able to provide me with another one and I was able to print my now and then I didn't get the job the first time but then it really made me feel bad because I really felt like I was gonna get in the first time but then the second time since it's close to my own mom's birthday the Lord provided me with another chance and I got in as a dishwasher and now my parents are able to come and my mom can come for her birthday and it just shows me that the Lord has just always has a better way for me just to kind of just clear she was so upset the first time she accepted it the job accepted in the job sorry for the Josh and so we were telling her at that time don't worry God has something I'm better a better time for you to get in so they had another opportunity about two months later to get in and she got accepted for the application because what they do is they try to teach them how to do when in the real world

you yeah man we come to the house of Lord let's see what we can see of him while we're standing let's all give the pastor a great big hand pastor appreciation day he's standing up right here right here one more time amen hey all you know what he told us though remember he told tells us every Christmas he said gifts are fine he should just be what I preach that's the that's the greatest gift that he'll have is this for us to see and understand what he's talking about that's the greatest gift you give them a million dollars and die and go to hell right but if you can get what he's saying it just may take us into a change of the body so that you can't put it all our amount on but thank God we do have pastor Appreciation Month but we need to do that 12 months out of the year right that paint looks good on you but I know it all righty then last time I'll come in on you in front everybody good to be in the house of the Lord and man good good man it's just wonderful when you start talking about things and Sunday School class and you walk up here and what do you do what do you do what do you do and and like I said listen that's got to be the Lord Coe that I tell you a little secret he and I do converse but we refrain from digging deep into what we're talking about because we don't want influence in each other he knows that so really we don't talk as much as you think we do you know normal things but as far as the word we do get into a few little highlights but I like what brother Klaus said broke laws that if you tell somebody that person could steal your fire to give it before you give it to the congregation we need to give it to the congregation and then let you speak back to us the man lets you speak back to us so that's what we're going to do this afternoon if you notice you've gotten your notes save the ones that Terrance gave you first for next Sunday when we'll get back on the seals for brother Dale said it was alright because I love this subject I love this subject I'll let my said I love this subject about the porter and the messenger comes the ndh because it what it does it clears up a lot of things so today we're just going to just piggyback on what he said you take what he said this morning and then let's not add to it let's just enhance it a little bit don't want to add you can't add to the Word of God but you can get a little more clarity obviously he can say it one way and I can say it another way and you get it my way or get it his way and not you know you understand what I'm saying so let's try this and see what we can do in our feeble in our feeble thoughts that we can maybe piggyback on what our brother Dale was talking about so maybe give a little more clarity I thought we he said he may do it next Sunday but I thought we got seven days and sometimes the devil likes to take and pull all that out of you right but let's get it fresh you've already had your mind on this morning so let's just kind of freshen it up a little bit this afternoon so let's turn to the book of John we're gonna shift gears big time from the seals now but still this has got a lot to do with the seal this tells you the placing of the seal amen this will tell you the facing of the ceiling we got you got you chart in front of you did everybody get one everybody got a chart and some of you got the quotes but the quotes will be up on the on the screen and and to just give you a note when Joe pulled these up I did this in 2007 this is a 2007 and now it's 2018 so 10 years later we've had just a little gap so we're gonna try to fill the gap in a little bit you know we've we've all learned a little bit more than we did in 2007 course brother Dale preached a way before then it meant so this is just you know he was we were talking about we were talking the other day going the hunting club and and I told him I said it's it's just it's not a miracle it's God that he hadn't had to change this doctrine over 50 years but I'm telling you know how important the seals are the seals were that important when they opened to him in 1982 I'm gonna say this there was no false doctrine in that there was nothing to have to to back up on once God opens these sails to you there's nothing to back up on same way we're brother branham yeah you know when he come to the opening the seals he knew where he was that he knew what he was talking about and he knew what was going on so that's one of the seals to me are very important let's turn to John 10 and let's read and let's talk a little about a bit about about the porter put it in Scripture then we're gonna put it on the chart and then we're gonna let brother branham take us through the through the message is that Alright say ma'am ma'am God got a good full house today so and it's hot up here too I'm sweating already John 10 verse 1 well this is that time of the year when the outside school and air conditioners don't come own and back and forth and back and forth so be glad when we can walk out in the new city and just don't worry about it yeah you just think it and it becomes that temperature well I love that just thinking Justin I wish it was 65 degrees John 10 first one in let's pray before we get started dear lord thank you for today thank you for the opportunity we have to be here thank you for a pastor that we can depend on Lord but it is all on you you are the author and finisher of our faith if we put our trust in you Lord then you'll never fail us you'll never lead us wrong you'll never lead us in error the Father we appreciate that we ask you to Lord that you'd forgive us of our sins and mistakes we made during the week that we call sin Lord that just disbelief in you Lord it's what causes a lot of things Lord we pray that our belief and our faith would be raised to a higher level to where Lord even when you walk down the street one day and a dead child combine the funeral procession and you've stopped and touched the child and the child come to life you didn't have to scream and holler and call on God you were God and you raised those that those people from the dead Lord without even raising your voice why because the power was there behind it it was the power behind the voice it's what makes the devil tremble Father give us this day our daily bread be with the ones that are not here that are sick some of theirs traveling Lord we pray that you'd be with them Lord just settle our mind keep us Lord always in your will bless the missionaries on the foreign field give them fruit for the labor Father in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen John 10 verse 1 says verily I say unto you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same as a thief and a robber he then enter in by the door is the Shepherd of the sheep now jesus said white I am the door I am the way the truth and the life right to him the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calls his own sheep by name and leadeth them out and when he put it forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the Sheep follow him for they know his voice and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers this parable spake Jesus unto them but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them jesus then said unto them then said Jesus unto them again very rarely I saying to you the door of the sheep you may be seeding the lure - blessing to the reading the word now let's talk them in about the porter now the porter if you are able to and I know some of you may have went to something besides the motel 6 when you go somewhere you know they don't have Porter's but if you go to a rich the the ritz-carlton and all those places they have a guy named up called a porter remember he stands at the door he's got the top hat on a lot of times and he's standing there in a three-piece suit well he's just not standing there for window dressing he has a job and what's the first thing you do you say sir where do I go well the Porter's job is as to have I want you to get this now the Porter's job is he is not some Joe Blow that they hired off the street yesterday and put him in front of the door no the porter he's been all into every room in the hotel he's been where the where the restaurant is he's been to where all the restrooms are he's been he knows that place like the back of his hand because he's been there he went and visited everything inside that hotel and then he stands at the door and when you say ok where is the restroom he says ok you go two doors down turn down the hallway turn left he doesn't have to go in there to take you he tells you because he already knew what it was in there where it was amen so that's what a porter is that's what a church age messenger in is but that's also what our pastor is in different ones that stand at the door now remember they something that stands at the door and don't go in and won't let you in amen we're not talking about that porter today we're talking about the porter that when you ask him a question he knows because he's already been there so that porter opens the door and lets you in why because he knows the door he knows what's behind the door so that's why Jesus was talking about the porter to him the porter openeth what the door and the sheep hear his voice and he calls his own sheep by name and leadeth them out because remember we're all sheep all of us we're all sheep and we have to be led then jesus tells them he said I am the or of the Sheep I'm the door but the porter is the one that introduces come in this is what you get at the Ritz Carlton come in this is what you get it wherever you want to wherever you want to say amen and don't forget the tip the porter either pay your tithe just thought I'd throw that in there for a minute but yeah don't let the guy just stand there starve to death give him some money give him a little sleepy below ten every once in a while or a hundred a hundred hey yeah hey man so now let's pull up the chart and let's kind of go through what we keep in mind what brother Dale's been talking about like I said I've ever told you I love to do this okay all right you don't have to give me the bottom of that can you give me the bottom of that to where it says messenger to the aged can you so this is what brother Dale is talking about no we know these are the church ages right these are the church ages and then these are the open door but what we're going to do is read because I want to I want to kind of bring something to light brother Dale has been talking about this but let's read it stay right here now let's go to the first seal and watch what the angel does cuz we got to get the angels right and what they do before we can show their message amen all right so now let's read in the first seal let's go do it the first seal let's just read let's just read what brother Branham says about the number one on the first seal they had to man we had to put this thing together real quick because obviously I wasn't gonna do it but pull up the first seal paragraph 126 the first quote thank you got it now all right look now notice but it's to be revealed when the lamb leaves is in as the intercessory place from the father and we get on here and read it that's revelations five they taste a book of seals the book of seals of the book seal with seal breaks him then shows them look at the end of the age now at the end of the age all right if I got that after the accessory is over the church age has done finished he come in the first days the Ephesian is revealed sent the messenger notice what happened as we go along here's the plan of it now this is the prophet of God here's the plan of it first thing happens there's an announcement in the heavens first what happened a seal is open what is that a mystery is unfolded each church age messenger had a mystery to unfold all right what happened a seal is open what is that a mystery is unfolded see and when a mystery unfolds then a trumpet sound it declares a war now that's the spiritual war right or a plague falls and a church age open see what is the war part remember brother Dale has been preaching that it's not only condemnation that a prophet brings he brings condemnation but he also brings grace all right so what's brother Branham the ant what is the war part the angel of the church catches the mystery of God Luther catches the just shall live by faith not fully yet revealed but when he does he catches this mystery of God and then he goes forth to the people he's got to get the mystery first then he gives it to the people the porters got to know what's behind the door before he can tell you what's behind the door amen so he's got to be first partakers of the fruit goes forth to the people what does he do there he begins to proclaim that message and what does it start a war a spiritual war remember when brother Brown started his message the real message 63 owned after the seals when he started that message it was a spiritual war people left him by the towel right it was a spiritual war and then keep going up to the next one and then God takes his message with the elect of that age lays them away asleep and then he drops a plague upon those whose rejected it a temporary judgment then after that is over then he goes on they denominator and bring in denominations and start off with that men's work like Wesley and all the rest of them then he gets all in a scrapple again and another mystery comes forth then what happens another messenger arrives on earth for a church age then when he arrives he sound in other words the trumpet sounds he declares war and what happened finally then he's called away then when he's laid away then plague fall destroys them spiritual death hits the church and she's gone that group then he goes on to another now pull the chart back up please we're gonna be toggling back and forth between the chart so when when a church age is announced there's a messenger already there for to catch the mystery of God he rebukes the previous age hook number one look at your truck looking through what you got in your hand he condemns the world just by being here he condemns the world he rebukes the previous age from what from falling away from the first message they had and then he brings his message that's why Paul had to rebuke the Orthodox their brother del song in this morning and then bring his message to Ephesus we're now coming toward the end of the Ephesus now remember Paul dies in a t56 or something or 66 or something he's not here so what is it it's the people it's the people that catch his division or catches the mystery and the preachers carry it on and that because look even in Calamba he did I don't I think he's the one that died before the age even began but his message was carried on for 1500 or over a thousand years his message was carried on by the people somebody caught the revelation of what the man was about that all right you'll see in a minute as it goes on now that's why in the days of the voice of the seventh angel we can also send the days of the voice of the first angel now you can't go all the way through and say the mystery will be finished because Paul didn't finish all the mystery but when Paul when Paul came on the earth what do you do he condemned the world just by being there he rebukes the previous age he rebukes to the Pentecostal age that came in this would be ad 30 about right here when the day of Pentecost right then he brings his message to Ephesus well now he dies they come in and start preaching and then what happened Satan comes in one of them horse riders comes in and he erodes the truth down to here Irie Gnaeus picks it up right here the rebukes the previous age condemns the whole world for even being here rebukes the previous age then he brings his message to some Erna now that continues on as we go down through there but remember what brother Dale read in Leviticus 25 8 Leviticus 25 8 is seven times seven right seven seven seven seven seven seven seven seven times seven seven Church ages time the church ages is 49 that's 49 that's that's two hear that okay now they never and I didn't understand this till later home until I started studying it Leviticus 25 8 they celebrated every seven years but what the problem was is on the 49th year they were to declare a Jubilee a new Jubilee a 50th for the next year and then everything went free if you owe 10 million dollars to somebody they gave it back to you your account was 0 hallelujah your account with 0 but in the real world those Jews never wanted that account to be 0 so the real Jews never had a 50th Jubilee they just kept going 49 then what happens is is you got to remember because watch what brother Brown said on on the Daniel 7 new weeks he said it'll be the 70th Jubilee from according to Leviticus 25 8 which is thirty four hundred thirty years now 70 times seventy is how much I mean 70 times 50 that's thirty five hundred years they say brother Branham was wrong no he's exactly right because on the 49th year starts the first year of the next 49 years so now take 70 70 times 49 that's thirty four hundred and thirty years exactly anyways talking about there was that you believe that no one ever how did you believe sure they would be a relief sure they would go free but his brother Dale said there's always one catch and that's this thing right this is the catch is this thing every church has had a catch remember brother mom said they couldn't get all the way out why because it was a seven it was released you could go free but if you were given something inside of that seven years it couldn't go free this you were given this and this don't go free under a seven and then is that helping to explain what's going on that seven seven is forty-nine now we need a fifty because that's the golden jubilee and that year was supposed to be proclaimed and if I old brother Colley fifty thousand dollars and somebody else told him twenty thousand dollars and some mail told him $10,000 he wrote down zero because everything went free now the Jude the natural Jews will never do that because they love this that's why they never celebrated the 50th Jubilee never did in the whole history of time Israel hasn't it sure they've done the seven sevens they let people go free but they never cleared the account to zero that's you and I we've never cleared the account to zero there's always been one mark and that's the milettis boy right here so if we stay in this boy right here we continue in that we just what happened here Paul's group came in they all died then Iranians group come in strong strong strong then they died Martin comes in takes and rebukes Irina says people for falling away brings his message rebukes and fall rebukes and fall rebukes and following that folks there's not another circle over here you see what that says that says eternity so there's not another message for us to go down into the ground and then come back up giving it to another message or another Porter there is no other Porter we're done we're finished with the porters everybody all right with that say men that is playing that okay now let's go to the next quote evening now remember keep these three things in mind the messenger condemns the world rebukes the previous age then brings this message because you're going how it's going to be important right here right because who was brother branham always to rebuking the pentecostal always all right Paul now you got to remember you got your alpha and you got omega now in my other chart that I had I wrote Pentecost right here but we can't find that chart because there had to be a Pentecostal age right here because remember there's a Pentecostal age in your alpha Brides there's got to be a Pentecostal age in your mega brother amen all right with that you can write that in on yours because you can keep that copy that's yours that's not copyrighted I won't charge you down I promise we've used this all over the world but they they really enjoyed this we did this in Jamaica about mobile or 10 years ago or longer and brother Keith in them still we're talking about the other day that they still had the message that I preached in 2006 I believe it was they still had the quotes that's how they hold on to stuff we just kind of talk are here and there but they still had them after 12 years or 10 years ever how was it still talking about it some but it will help you if you'll pay attention evening light message paragraph 79 each messenger has had his message and the message and the messenger of the age and it was most remarkable that each messenger we even found in the church ages tonight will go back into the Testament Old Testament finest the same way this is 1963 after the seals that God sends the messenger of that age at the end of the time always at the end never at the beginning at the end now as Luther's age faded out Wesley's came in and when Wesley sanctification faded out Pentecostal age come in everybody see that Pentecostal age came in as always the messenger opens up the new message at the end of the old there by right will that say Amen it is it's of each age that that's been done and we know that it's the truth all right now let's continue on paragraph 81 excuse me this is a repeat this is repeated each time through the Bible we find that in the sacred scriptures all the way through that just at the ending of the old age the new one coming in that age fades out and the new age comes in God sends the messenger now remember I told you in brother Branham talks about a lap over these church ages that you see on your chart should be like this not like that but for clarity the Prophet drew it and God drew it so that's the way to do it but if you have a lap over then your ages should lap like this then all right and as always every time the messenger comes is always a callback to the word cuz that's what got you away you got you you got away from the word so they were calling you back to the word it's always the call back to the word never fails remember this is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ there cannot be nothing added to it or taken from it it's the complete revelation of Jesus Christ in the only way they can ever will be sure if you thing rises up that's contrary to this revelation then it's wrong pretty sure of yourself huh I say the same thing Amen now let's go to countdown mmm but now something else has happened we got an astronaut now John Glenn was our first astronaut find out that that's so far above the airplane airplane can only go as far as there's pressure and so forth but this is by an atomic power a greater power that presses him so much higher than an airplane an airplane even even isn't in it that's right he's been able to do it now we got an astronaut natural agent so I put that in there just to say look we are up here so we got understanding is that we're able to be pressurized enough to understand what's going on all right there by okay with that say ma'am all right now let's go to the Laodicean Church age we got a lot of quotes here but I want you to I want you to realize that this is not some something that brother Dale hatched up several years ago no this is what brother Ralph preached in the 50s and the 60s so it's not something new the angel of this Laodicean church they ended up now we be he will be at the end of the age now what age is he gonna be at the end there of all right because I'm telling us what he said he'll be at the end of the age like the rest of them locked the Bible he'll be at the end of the age that's like brother Dale when he said he said if you put brother around him right here that's the beginning of the age no no that's not true he'll be at the end of the age not at the first of it at the end of it because the angel always comes to rebuke them for what they done to the angel church allowed to steal write these things to the Angel Church of Smyrna write these things each one is to the angel at the end of the age Paul the end of the age and on down end of the age Delap over he's talking about what we talked about the leftover into the age into the age that's what makes it loud what makes it laugh is is this messenger on the scene while that church age is still going on that okay that age is still going on the messenger drops into that put into that slot but he still got people that's in that church age that he's got to deal with and there's some that's left their first love they some dis left what that messenger brought amen and that's what the God that's why I thought strikes him with a message to bring them people with him if he can or if you don't put a plague on that's what I said right the Lapp overseas to the angel speaking what it was this lapse over here to the angel the end of the that age see picking it right here made to lap like stair steps going up the seven church age now what the stair steps do they lap over each other that's what he's talking about so he's saying they do lap over each other all right they're not like this they lap over all right because we're going to see that when we get to this last Church age how they brother Brown came on the scene and had to lap back and pick up try to pick up the Pentecostal that all right all right now let's go to deep color to the deep and I want to show you now watch let's go back to the chart for a minute back to the chart okay there you go now here's Paul if I got here's Paul coming at the end of this Pentecostal age this is AD 32 ad 53 lap over in there somewhere here comes Paul in here right he was not he was not in the age of Pentecost but he was but he wasn't that messenger to them Holy Ghost came himself on the day of Pentecost ad 30 right you gonna hear that no mention to the age so there's no messenger to this age a man the Holy Ghost came himself 120 in the upper room they got the baptism of the Holy Ghost now Paul wasn't there there was 11 there Plus Matthias that they put in that during this time because what I'm fixing to tell you is that Paul is going to say in the Bible that he was born out of due time he was one that should have been born in the Pentecostal age now I'm fixing to read you a quote where brother Branham you remember the deep collars of the date we've watched that many times the video right the video of the deep code for the deep that was I don't know where it was that but remember brother Brown he tells him watch what he says and if this ain't Paul if in st. Paul coming now let's go to deep colors of the deep no doubt in my mind but what there's more people millions in the world more worthy of the tax that proclaiming Jesus Christ than I am this is 1956 now that's in Columbia South Carolina but the one he did in Washington DC on the video he says basically the same thing that's true I'm noting the least among you I was born out of season among you now who's the full gospel Pentecost what was he telling him this is what I think brother Brown was saying I should have been there 1906 on his Uther Street with you guys but he wasn't imagine even to them Paul's saying I should have been I'm will read it to you Paul says I was born one out of due time I should have been back there with you no eat well he's just saying that to tell you what position is in I was born out of season amongst you four gospel people I was a Baptist and you more moan about the scripture maybe than I do but I know the offer real well and I know that he's there and I know who I believe and I want you to believe me that's why I'm here to help you all right now let's go to the one in Washington DC the one where we have the the video of I believe the prophet Daniel saw a vision he said he was troubled at his head many days is that rotten Jesus one times when a woman with enough faith to pull him around he said I perceived that virtue has gone out of you and people right out of there when it's not me Christian no I'm just a man chief of sinners but one born out of season to you full gospel people that's right by grace by God's grace he lets me call you my brother and sister and I love you and he talks about that he says the only alternative I have a being here what he's saying was he should should have been back there in 1906 and owns industry what he said born I'd do time now let's go to the let's go to first Corinthians well let's reread that one you read well skip that one just go to first Corinthians to save time now here's here's Paul before I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received how that Christ died for our sins according to the scripture and that he was buried and then he rose again the third day according to the scripture and then he was seen of Cephas then of the twelve after that he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once of whom the greater part remain unto this present but some have fallen asleep after that he was seen of James then of all the apostles and last of all he was seen of me also as of one born out of due time both of them replacing each other where they should have been proving there was a Pentecostal age at the first proving there was a Pentecostal age between Wesley and Laodicea then all right yes good yeah I think Frieda had a good time this morning she she saw some things I like people to see things they'd never seen before you know what this is all about amen that's what they know about being able to see something you didn't see before she always everybody would be that way ever service you'd order to get something amen all right listen make sure oh here we go sign of the time let's read that quote because brother Branham places Paul God deals for today what he does tomorrow's up to him he always deals with us with an individual because groups have been have too many ideas look even the Apostles after they tried to choose one because of Judas falling they cast lots and it fell on Matthias that was the best they could do with the keys to the kingdom and there's not a scripture wrote where he did anything but God chose Saul ill-tempered little fella but he had to throw him on his back one day and let him look up a while he said I'll show him what great things he has to suffer for me see the church chose my thighs but God chose Paul and then we're gonna see that the church chose dogmas instead of brother Branham amen that's the difference God always does his choosing his election God does that by election by his foreknowledge that's what's wonderful all right now I'm gonna read this quote then we're gonna pull the chart back up that's okay guys okay I'll tell you what pull the chart up some of you just got the thing read it let me read it real quick then along come the pink on stage with the baptism Holy Spirit and they kept us down on that brother man I mean brother Dale read that this morning now there cannot be no more ages now look there's no more ages the flatus in aged truly the land of seein age is over for us but it goes completely into the Millennium remember your old seventh-day continues into the Millennium the Millennium is still in the seventh day you don't get to the eighth day till the future home earthly but you and I are in the eighth day so right now but we're going to be in the eighth day in our body when that thing gets changed we're going to bring it here and then the world's going to follow behind us is that Alright that ought to make you happy now there cannot be no more ages that's all the Philadelphia correct itself the layout of CNH now we find in the study of the scripture that's a messenger to the age comes right at the end of the age every time Paul come at the end of the age we find out Iranians come at the end of the eighth now you think well he's just scattering it everywhere but watch what he does this when he nails it down Martin into the AIDS Luther the end of the Catholic age what wesley at the end of the Lutheran age and Pentecost at the end of the Lutheran age no look and Pentecost at the end of the age of sanctification through the baptism of the Holy Ghost and at the end of the Pentecostal age brother Brian what are you talking about at the end of the Pentecostal age we're supposed to receive according to the word is God help me tonight to show you through here to receive a messenger that will take all those loose ends out there and reveal the whole secret to God for the rapture in the church at the end of the Pentecostal age there by right with that now bring the chart back up and I'm going to read this quote again and we're going to place it if that's okay just for a visual because you get it more when you visual all right when you'll see it now they cannot be the more aegis that's the layout of C&H we found the state of Scripture right at the end of the age Paul come at the end of the age of what pentacle we find out Iranians at the end of Ephesus the age Martin the end of the age now watch Luther the end of the Catholic age now Luther at the end now what was the age of Calvin that the Catholic Church ruled the world that's the Catholic age right there okay so Martin comes in Irina's Columba comes at the end here and then what Luther comes at the end of the Catholic age which is right here proving that he comes him he's the porter that comes in between takes them out Wesley at the end of the could you put that there Wesley at the end of the Lutheran age and what is this the age of sanctification is that not justification same casing baptismal hole god right this is the age of sanctification Wesley at the end of the Lutheran age and Pentecost at the end of the age of sanctification through the baptism of the Holy Ghost and at the end of the Penn College what more are you talking about brother Branham into the Pentecostal age that's what he just said all right now let's read the next quote did that place that pretty good for you we still haven't got to the end we got to get to the key in a minute but we got to get all this straightened out further let's go to questions and answers on the seals justification is a work of the Holy Spirit sanctification is a work of the Holy Spirit but the baptism is the Holy Spirit that's the reason it took a prophetic prophet to come down no messenger to the age now remember excuse me there was no messenger to the first Pentecostal aid it was the Holy Ghost come himself what's he saying right here no messenger to the age because the Holy Ghost came himself and his fullness of the baptism but at the end of the age what age that age the Pentecostal age at the end of the age as it always ends up on the other we find there than the messenger sent and all these scruples and things are placed into place then the rapture comes for the church thereby right with that now let's read a quote same Holy Ghost that saved the Lutheran they sanctified the Methodist now same Holy Ghost that baptized the Pentecostals is now setting in order the Pentecostal age didn't call the coming of the Lord no coming Lord is in this age it's now setting an order the coming of the Lord Jesus when it be so powerful that body will come into this group of church that will draw the rest of them from the grave there'll be a resurrection now that's been what we've been talking about on the seal that's what the Holy Ghost is far what is the Holy Ghost without us they cannot be made perfect they lived in one day under that we live in another when the enemy comes in like the flood out of the Spirit of God to raise up for standard when their eyes were open that's quote watching place this Moses couldn't have come with Noah's message neither could Jesus come with Moses this message see it was so it was lauded for each our brother Desmond tell us about that's true every mission remember it goes back to my box Luther's got a box Wesley's got a box Pentecost got a box we got a box our box is a resurrection but I walked watch now we couldn't come with Luther's message we couldn't come with Luther's message neither with Wesley neither with the Pentecostal message we're plumb beyond that we're plumb beyond that you say oh that's something that's something you will so did the Catholic Church think Luther was making it up so did Wesley thing or the Lutheran's think that Wesley was making it up so did the Westlands think that the Pentecostals made it up but the thing of it is looked back in the scripture it identifies every age all right harvest time notice closely don't miss this what if Moses would have come bringing Noah's message it wouldn't have worked couldn't know what if Jesus no this is the Word made flesh this is the Word made flesh German chocolate cake sausage biscuits with honey they yelled it y'all didn't put any honey women biscuits did you Mayan honey on the bacon biscuit good thought the rapture took bling but it didn't cause I'm still hungry but look watch pay attention this is the homestretch it wouldn't have worked what if we come trying to bring the Methodist message back Baptist message are the Pentecostal message it wouldn't work they were fine prove that in a minute by the word they were all right in their age that age is gone we got to find out what the scripture says for today this day that's what man is to live by for his age now let's read a quote that makes stump you a little bit but I'm gonna let brother Brennan tell you and we took the Elijah of the first run we took the Elijah to follow him we took John the Baptist after that who was the Elijah of that day and a promise for another in this day now John the Baptist was not the Elijah of Malachi for he was the Elijah of Malachi 3 jesus said so behold I send my messenger before my face to prepare the way we find him being that now in doing so in finding those positions we know that all the rest of the scripture inspired of God reveals to us that were in the last day now if I come with the message of Pentecost I would be in the Laodicean Church age because it stumped you a little bit this morning when brother Brown said brother on me brother nail said brother Brown wanting the message in the lab said he just said he wasn't sure he came in laodicea sure he brought a message in Laodicea sure he's the seventh angel messenger no doubt but if you don't place him right we go in there rapture well we're not taking the body change rapture just happens Raptor just happens after we take the body change like I said I'm not looking for a rapture no more am I looking for a rapture I ain't even gonna sing that song I see you in the rapture ain't saying it no more well I'm not I want something by the body change first in a resurrection then we'll move into a rapture but you won't just go I'm going in the rapture no now if I come with a message of Pentecost I would be in the letter C in church age and it wouldn't be right and it wouldn't be right that's the reason that Wesley could not take Luther's message Luther was in one a church age Wesley was in another church age as Jesus would have come the message of Moses it would not have worked if Moses would have come with the message of no it would not have work but God has allotted to his people his his people of every age of Scripture does a member brother branham has two scriptures to work with two prominent ones malachi for was to turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers he did that but then when the age moved on he became the messenger of this hey hello hey just said he's tonight if I brought the message to Pentecost which was what they were speaking in tongues the Holy Ghost was fallen giving them gifts brother Branham was in that movement people he was in that Pentecostal movement but he wasn't a messenger to that age the Holy Ghost was a messaging to that age to the Pentecostal age brother Branham was the messenger to the eighth day people that's being you not in the years of preparation this is the years of preparation I would be in the layout of seeing church age and it wouldn't be right there by all rights Amen all right let's go to the next one because no what happened just between the Methodists and Pentecost were going out I have said an open door he's going back to the church ages there you are the name restored again I've set an open door but I'm the way the truth and the life no man cometh father said by me what is it that open door now that open door that Luther open and that Wesley open there was doors in doors they couldn't go in there was revelation that was withheld from them because it was not for them because Luther was a Trinitarian Wesley was a Trinitarian Pentecost original was Trinitarians you can't change this body with a Trinitarian idea but God winked at ignorance the Holy Ghost fell on the people on the Zuzu Street and restored the gifts restored the Holy Ghost in a people restored the gift to the people and then and even brother Branham was in that part of that but what did he do he kept moving on I read you one a minute ago Pentecost you cabbage down now remember what I said the messenger when he comes on the scene what's the first thing he does he condemns the world America will be destroyed because brother Branham was in this in this country I guess you may call it cuz he called judgment on him because they rejected him all right but what did he do though he rebuked the previous age pull the bullet chart back up he rebuked who he didn't rebuke Wesley not did he he rebuked Pentecost for for what not going further in the revelation they cabbage down and then brother Branham in 1962-63 began his message to an eternal group of people an eighth day message my brother Dale always said read through read the titles after them the seals were open it's like I said last Sunday and I hope you got there Bob sent me a text you know I'm like brother Dale listen he know you can sit there and talk all day you won't do about one thing or another but when you bring back to him what he preaches that's what makes us happy inside when you bring back to us what we're preaching Bob sent me a text he said that door was sealed with seven seals remember Jesus standing at the door knocking he the son of man revelation was what was put out of the church not that son of God revelation we were going to get into that today but we'll get into it next Sunday upon this rock I'll build my church he built the church on the Son of God revelation but the son of man was put out of the church behold I stand at the door not what in our age he was put out it was sealed was that door was sealed with seven seals well once those seals were broke what what did I tell you why did I tell you at first the seals do not bring you the holy ghost people get the Holy Ghost and don't know what seals are and man that's the Son of God revelation right that's the Son of God revelation right but when the seven seals break that's the revelation of the Son of Man this guy and then when you open the door what did I tell you that the seals is not for your read it or not for your salvation it's what it's to restore fellowship between you and God well you know what there's a there's a door between you and God there's no fellowship there listen let me just be real honest there's no fellowship between me and Jim when she's got the door shut they might be a war I don't know why I'm looking at you boys oh there might be a war but all when that door is open and I can see that beautiful bride standing there and I know she loves me and I understand her and soonest that's what God wanted the seven seals opens the door I hope you see that anybody all right now let's read let's go on down skip it down to save for time skip down to go past brother Anderson go press the Philadelphian church age and go where it says last century aged paragraph 58 then we'll come back to the chart and we'll try to yeah but I just like to give you my quotation of what this angel will be what we're looking for would it be all right Congress says I'm in being that we got a little time I just wrote a little quotation here when I thought the angel of this layout of sin church they ended up now he will be at the end of the age amen he'll be at the end of the age like the rest of them like the Bible he'll be at the end of the age not the first of it the end of it now remember he didn't come at the end of Wesley's age or he would have rebuked the sanctification people he came at the end of Pentecost to rebuke the Pentecost and bring his message now he'll be at the end of the age like the rest of them like the Bible he'll be at the end of the age 92 first at the end because the angel always comes to rebuke them for what they done to the angel the church the latest here right these things see to the Angel Church of Smyrna write these things see each one is to the angel at the end of the age Paul in the age on down into the age lap over we read this will read again into the age that's what makes it lap so there's your lap over your stair-step all right let's go now to our favorite quote in this whole church paragraph 327 lat asiye now this master of Malachi 4 in Revelation is 10 7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi for he will turn the hearts of the children to the father's two he revealed the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations Tim which are the revelations command and seventh seal it will be these divinely revealed mystery troops that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so a man so that's the two things when brother Branham came on the earth what do you do what do you do he rebuked at Pentecost from getting away from their first love from getting away from Pentecost he brought us up to 1962 or so ish and they remember there's a lap over to everything mm-hmm you said well this mess is starting to see us well March March the third nineteen sixties no go back to spoken words original see because that's kind of where it all get started then he does statue of a birthing man blasphemous name he keeps working this way up restoration of the bride tree serves what is the time may but we did that one time on a chart up here then he brought the seal so he had there's a stair step going up to that process but the process was what getting us back to the faith of the fathers so that he could get us into an eighth day manifestation his message was a message of eternal life oh yeah his message with eternal life in the first part but those people under that administration died remember edging the questions answers on the sales he said it's gone from you it's not for you you're not to get him why they were stuck in that old Pentecostal age now look we've read this many times I'm not gonna read them again I'm just gonna tell you something brother Brown says not in the healing service the message that follows the healing service brother Dale's read them not in the healing service but the message that follows the healing service I have heard but now I see works his face to express all these his message was not to restore the gifts Pentecost restored gifts in the church I'm telling you I get a Smith Wigglesworth read his work I mean here's a man that now he didn't have a worldwide message but he was world known but he was so much of a faith healer remember the guy that was a guy that didn't have one foot his leg was cut off at his knee he told the guy he said you go down to the shoe store and he said you have your shoes fitted for both of your feet the guy looked at him kind of strange he said you do what I said and he said watch God work now here's the story the guy goes down there sits down now look he sits like this he got no leg from here down sits down they measure this shoe the guy goes and gets the shoe when he comes back there's two feet now that's a great healing campaign but Smith Wigglesworth never changed the world in his message he was still a trinitarian a man even even if at Bosworth was a trinitarian you see they all they all were stuck in that Pentecostal age to where God blessed the gifts he blessed the speaking in tongues he blessed the people but there come a time when they said this is it God said no that's not it I was just showing you this so you could get back amen so that's what brother Branham now here's my assumption bring the chart bucket here's what I see brother Branham said 1977 would be the 70th Jubilee since the beginning of Jubilees according to Leviticus 25 eight brother Dale read through Leviticus 25 eight that is seven sevens is 49 right Leviticus 25:10 is a 50 that's when everything goes free that's not happened yet it has in your soul but it's not happening you complete release comes remember your 50 everything goes free body spirit and soul takes the change all right here's my you say well well when did all this age end and age begin I believe the loudest in church days in 1906 began under the baptism of the Holy Ghost being the messenger to that age then brother Branham says now I'm not to mention you to lay out to see you may I just read you that so when did the Pentecostal age in I believe it was 1977 there's your seven sevens it's because Pentecost is still in your seventh you said we're not allowed to see us - sure it is but we're not the message we receive is not in the seventh day the message we receive is in an eighth day because listen just be real real plain from 65 to 77 it was mass confusion for some this one's going to lead and this one's going to lead and this one's got a message and this one's got a message and you got to follow me you got to have seven thunders you got to have seven men you got to have this you got to have that they were wandering in the wilderness but in 1977 I believe people started realizing that that was gone that was the Pentecostal age that was gone because remember brother Branham was standing in 1963 he said it's gone from you you're not going to get it live a good simple Christian life but let's put a couple quotes together Reese says but somebody's gonna catch this and carry it on to the coming of the Lord same way what Paul you say well brother branham's not here in the days of the voice on the Sabbath angel Paul wasn't here during probably 10% of that church age so who carried that church age the people carried that church age the true message that Paul preached was carried by a group of people but it got to a place to where that white horse rider took off then the red horse rider took off then the black horse rider took off and now we're facing the pale horse rider which is all them spirits now now look not these spirits that's the Holy Spirit these spirits you see how these spirits have progressed and remember right here I wish y'all wouldn't put that there brother Branham remember that would know remember that was all black he said I put in a little bit of light you know what a little bit of light was me and you that little bit of light was me I wait a minute that will be like with me I don't know about you but that little bit of light was me that was the grace that God give us to understand that we are in an eighth day message we're not in a Pentecostal message sure Pentecost is wonderful but we're not in that listen I told him downstairs the son of man watch how he reacted to things in Matthew Mark Luke and John if you watch how he reacts that's the way you supposed to react but now what do we do when somebody needs healing we you know we grab them when we shake them and we pull only slap them Jesus never did that you know what I told him downstairs the Son of Man the Son of Man walked into a room and the devil started talking to him hello hey Sharon the devil started talking to him they started identifying who he was that's what I want to happen when we walk into a room I want the devil to identify self he didn't have to take legion and grab him by the head what'd he do soon as Jesus stepped his foot off that boat Legion comes up and says why are you here that son of God why are you here to torment us before our time they knew who he was sure they did so I want the son of man revelation to be that when we walk in this door the Devils are going to say can we leave please can we leave please we laugh but we all got a little devil sitting on our shoulders you know we all got little demons that we need to get rid of well when Jesus walked in the Son of Man walked in they were going hey can we just go somewhere else that's a group of pigs out there in the field you mind if we go tuck ourself in you know what Jesus he didn't say I'll but he said go go go that's the power of the Son of Man folks we hadn't got into that yet but that's the power that these seals are revealing to us that a person was standing on earth in human flesh called us on a man that was the eighth day standing because remember what day did he resurrect on first day of the week which was the eighth day he resurrected right into eternity because when he come out of that grave he was totally eternal that all right think about that that same Jesus is here that same message is here that same person that now brother Branham comes at the end of the age in 1977 we are now we were able to understand because we're now in that 50th Jubilee we are taking a release that will get us all out of here they'll take us all not in a rapture hi you thought I'd stay right you didn't I'm looking for a resurrect because we were going to get into it today where first thessalonians said what shout voice trumpet brother bottom explains every one of them week which are alive and remain shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep for the dead in Christ shall rise first and when they come out of their graves they're not gonna half that's not what's coming out this morning listen Melchizedek when he walked up to Abraham now what in the world would you speak think of a God that walks up to Abraham hello Abraham walks up to Abraham LKC go now Abraham you're gonna be changed and I'm gonna do it my milk isn't it I'm Almighty God now I'm gonna change your body Abraham and be this like me I'd say you need to go find your rest home and bring me God cuz my guards twenty year old man my guards in the prime of his life when Melchizedek walked up to the Abraham he had a gleam in his eye he said Abraham I have come to tell you what's going to happen I have come to tell you that you go take a body change then you gonna have a child and Sarah's over going not gonna have pleasure with my husband one more time and God said now ain't nothing too hard for God with God all things that's what he said to Mary with God all things are possible listen I mean your God can't your gods that way man I believe when Joshua which is the same guys Melchizedek the one that he met now he didn't meet the captain of the host and the captain of the host was about couldn't get his sword out of his no Joshua and you know what Joshua was threatened by cuz he drew his sword and he said who are you for you force are you against us in other words he went some little Barney Fife looking thing he was probably built and he was a formidable opponent but when he spoke to Joshua and he said Joshua I am the captain of the hope I have come and take off your shoes because where you stand in this holy ground Amen that was a there was Almighty God never been out of his youth that's the oldest God's ever looked because when he resurrected he didn't look like that it was a 20 year old kid that's why I'm mayor Magdalene turned and looked and said are you the gardener she never saw him at 20 years old but when he spoke she knew that voice that's the same thing with you and I we have heard the voice and that voice is in 1,100 sermons and it's being preached around the world every day and one day we are going to get this thing right we are preaching to you the words of eternal life we're not waiting on one to come to preach and we're preaching it now who else is it coming from you say you see me no I'm not saying me but I'm saying the ministry around the world it's preaching the message of eternal life and you know what without error without error you better believe that you're sitting somewhere that there's not error being preached because your body will not be changed by error Jesus's body was changed because he was the Word made flesh if you're born again today you are the Word made flesh but you're now in the time that Daddy Elijah can come and talk to you not back then not the old order not the old not the old generals they're all gone I believe we're like Joshua the captain the hostess showed up he said I come to take over and that's what he wants to do he wants to take over you he wants to take over your body he wants to take over your spirit and I hope he's already took over your soul let's stand to our feet but the messenger comes at the end of the age there's not a church ages there's not eight messengers but there's eight manifestations to get us to an eternal message and then that all right because right here hmm I thought the headstone was to come in the end time that's what that is that's your eighth day hey man let's sing a song hope that was good it was good for me cuz I enjoy we'll get back on the seals hey we were talking on the seal just now so but we'll get into our fourth seal maybe we'll get us get us some body change here pretty quick I'm gonna need one yeah our dick this is where we get older brother al brother dick yeah you just keep believing buddy because God didn't welcome saying Abraham you're 99 I don't think it's possible now oh no it was more impossible you know why because Abraham looked at the revelation and he saw the person he gave him the revelation was a young man but he knew he was Lord he knew he was a creator he was Melchizedek and that Melchizedek became Jesus Christ and that Jesus Christ come into you and you are now the sinless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ you just got to believe it say something or I'm gonna keep preaching [Laughter] balancing I've been changed no let's say no we're gonna sing what you said you're the song leader what is it where's 433 let's sing this song silly
