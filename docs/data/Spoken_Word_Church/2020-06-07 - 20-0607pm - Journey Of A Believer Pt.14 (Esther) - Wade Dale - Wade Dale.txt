today holy holy holy holy holy holy I want to see mm that means I want to understand you Lord I want to understand who you are good to be in the house with Lord let's give these young people a round of applause and the ones that help them do their job around little man a man yes thank you Lord we remember when a lot of them were left little we're in the first group some groups have moved on and started having their own group so I remember when Amy's not hearing me and Jeffrey they they got married but before they got married they were in a little group then they got any youth group and then they got married started their own group so I guess that's why it should be by the time I start your own group but good to be in the house of the Lord good to have each and every one of you here there's a few things we're gonna cover right here real quick those of you that want to go back to having service as it was and get rid of this blue tape up here we need to as a church vote on it brother Dale's okayed it I just said let's open it up and my younger brother with all the wisdom said now let's vote on it so that's to me that's better so of all of you that want to have it as regular service would you raise up your hand and they're looking downstairs I think it's about 100 percent but I still want us to be careful they're looking downstairs brother Anderson I hope he didn't forget I asked him to run down there he did it's good okay but if you have a concern if you are sick please don't come sniffles sneezes and other things but we know listen we we didn't understand this thing back in March and April we didn't know what we were looking at but I think we do know what we're looking at now we're looking at at a virus that is that is deadly to a degree and and it hits the older people more than it does the younger people and people with pre-existing conditions so it would be I figured so it would be every 100 percent downstairs - it would be foolish to just say it was nothing we know better than that but we need to make sure that we continue to wash your hands and if you have a cough don't call on somebody okay but I think we I think everybody's kind of wanting to get back but we still need to be cautious about it really cautious we're still gonna wipe the doorknobs off we're still gonna wipe the doors in the back and you'll still see the hand sanitizer everywhere which is a good idea anyway maybe to cut down on any of the other things that we might that we might get and but I think that when they Sunday will begin back with the regular Sunday School classes brother boy I've already talked to him mm-hmm he will I will and everybody to be back together in their Sunday School classes but if you have a reservation about it please let us know and it will not bother us one bit if you want to sit downstairs away from it right it won't bother us a bit at all it's your it's your personal preference but like brother Nell said then you'll go to Walmart Monday and spend half a day so just just watch what you're doing we are not social distancing much now anyway you saw all of them singing up here you know some but that's the younger kids but just hey listen pray let's just don't forget this thing let's just keep them in prayer with brother Dale still got the prayer cloths over all the doors and we know how that how that works we've seen it work hundreds of times you know praying over things and laying that prayer cloths on somebody and seeing cancer being taken care of and a lot of different things so it's good to see brother Hal back with us looking good back there good to have you back with us buddy he's kind of one of those like brother Colley he's if there's a void there that nobody else can fill it so but remember that too we will start that brother Aaron his preaching Wednesday night all right and today is mom's birthday party her birthday was Friday she was a little bit over 45 and we'll have a little party for today downstairs after the second service also the youth will stay and we will have questions and answers up here your adult you adults are welcome to stay but we are having we're not buying pizza for everybody but if you have a child that is participating in the Youth Service you can stay and have a piece of pizza but not not for everybody that's not for everybody it's for the youth okay all right also next Sunday and for those of you that still got your calendar make sure that you hang them to your calendar even with calendars we still forget Esther you can lead them to water but you can't get them to drink it Donnie said I said where were you out last night they don't mama stays right there front last night Bible spec you know you see that look and you know you forgot that's why I give you these but since you see them on the back of the seats and in the trash can I guess it doesn't do a whole lot of good but anyway it makes me feel good that I can go it's on the refrigerator yeah it's on the refrigerator along with all the other stuffs on the refrigerator but I think the ladies are ready to go I'm gonna get this real quick ladies are ready to go in a couple of weeks on that well our Father today but they're thinking they need to take the tree out so anyway but our Father's Day fishing trip is a go I talked to the girl yesterday and we're good to go with our with our Lodge that we've rented up in Roberts town next Sunday after the second service we will be meeting as men to discuss just the logistics of getting all food up there and who's going and who's not going the thing sleeps 25 people and I think we've got 21 confirmed going so we still have a little bit of space we will have a cookout on Friday night some of you brothers call a few and brothers already want to come up y'all like you did you know before they were you wanted okay but we're having a cookout on Friday night which will be right there at the lodge and it is a real nice place is air-conditioning got a big porch and it's got places to to play and all that for the kids plus brother Richard Roberts is getting a map together for the fishing it's kind of gonna be a little different than we used to do it before Chattahoochee we all knew where to fish because the river was right there but this kind of we're in a central location they're in Roberts town and there are several places you can fish there's also zip line there's also canoeing rafting whatever you want to do maybe not rafting but different things you can do tubing that's what I was trying to say so there'll be a lot of things that we can do and that will be on Thursday the 18th on Thursday evening we'll get there four o'clock we'll be there until Saturday morning at 11:00 I have to check out at 11 o'clock on Saturday and I think the sisters are going to be coming back on Saturday afternoon too so keep that in your prayers and on your heart also now remember July the 4th we will have a meeting here at 11 o'clock it will be a service for brother Andrew Glover it will be catered to the youth but anyone can attend also they'll be fellowship afterwards with members and hot dogs and then brother Andrew Glover will be here for that Sunday service so just keep that in your prayers that's July the 4th all right everybody got that same am all right so now I think that's it but we're gonna meet next Sunday some of the men will meet together and figure out if you're really gonna go or not and what time you're gonna go so god bless you love you with the love of the Lord thank you for everything thank you for everybody for participating in what we're doing here keeping people safe trying to make sure that everything's done right we kind of all scattered around all over the place trying to accommodate people and the and the older ones trying to get them up here so things sit down you know nor a good comfortable seat but thank you for the young some of your young ones and some of your families that sit downstairs and they're down there now you just pray that the Lord will bless us and we'll get back to where we can can fit us all back up here in the sanctuary I'm like brother Joe Canada said this morning it it's gonna be a choir when we get everybody here and get everybody back in the sanctuary again I think of the voice the walls may fall apart that's alright we'll build some new and so god bless you if you would turn your Bibles to the book of Corinthians and we'll read that one Scripture we've been reading we're still on journey of a believer this would be part 14 we're gonna try to finish esther today because to me Esther is a beautiful beautiful picture a beautiful book and the bible does not mention god one time but god's just all in it amen and it's given to us as the bible says for our example we read that in just a second i want us to make sure and some of the questions that's asked by our youth today in the in the youth bible study i think there's i love the way that they word the questions i know Bob kind of worded some of them a little bit different but I like the way they the kids ask questions because it comes straight from their mind from their heart about this you know if you walk through the world and and the question was even asked there I think even deanna maio asked us one time so well why is it this extra why is this why can't we just be Christians and just walk through the world and do what we can and do the best we can and you know and and not be different well you can't do that that's like brother Dale said this morning when God calls you God called you you responded but God calls you because he knew you would walk in the Word of God and you'll walk a different way amen and so we see this journey of a believer that we're trying to get is not just to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost but to go on with God to to get more of God to be able to - as we were talking about last night and the adoption there was a question about that there's a question today about the headstone and the different things the terminologies we use we're not used in Luther's day Wesley's day the word was still there they didn't add another Bible when brother Branham got here but he took a profit or as we're gonna see today it took a man named Mordecai to lead Esther through this maze of what we call Christianity and to kick-out with what we know is not right to live by the Bible and to live right and do the right things that's brother day understand this morning and then go to the part where Jesus were on the mountain and God said here you him same way with Mordecai same way with brother Branham we believe that the prophet of God was sent on a mountain give him he was given a message not just to tell us how to dress not just to tell us how to act the Bible already told us that but his message was to break open the top of that pyramid his message was to show us things that had already been written in the Bible but to shine so much light on it till it illuminates and that revelation of that word is gonna come back and live inside of us amen so that was brother Browns job it wasn't his job it wasn't his job to make us Christian hello it was not we should have lived Christian life anyway without a prophet being here but brother Branham restored back to that and then brought his message which was the opening of the seals which was that fourth or adoption or the placing or the capstone or the headstone are the opening of the seven seals is the way we see it that brother Branham was was taken up on the mountain and he was adopted and I believe he told us just exactly like Jesus he said if you're gonna get anything this little man is the only way you're gonna get it man so brother Branham was the Mordecai that was helping Esther so we see now that and you read we're going to read this a little bit today and we'll see that unfold in the life of a man that lived 2,500 years ago but we were able to and privileged to see that life live out through a man in just 60 something years ago 70 something years ago so god bless you let's pray do you have any father thank you for this day that you've given us thank you for the bride of Jesus Christ Lord thank you for sending us a prophet - sure enough Lord you've been wanting to communicate with man since you and Adam were in the garden and thus in the fall happened and you had to withdraw yourself a little while and then you came down here in human flesh and truly then nobody really understand understood who you were but you came back Lord on the day of Pentecost into a group of people and they began to start understanding what this man Jesus Christ is all about then in the end time you sent us the Prophet Lord and he went back into your mind father and he brought that mind out and revealed it to the people and gave it to us Lord so that we can sweep this thing onto the coming of the Lord cuz there's many things that we still have to do in our journey and our waaldt Lord but I believe we're walking in the right direction I believe we're trying our best all of us to do the right thing and and to climb up that mountain and not just be lazy Christians but Lord be active participant participants Lord in this journey as we see Abraham was and all Isaac and Jacob and Joseph all these different ones had a journey that they were on Lord and you brought them to a place and now we can see that place Lord lived out in our own lives probably give us this day our daily bread forgive us of our sins blessed Lord the missionaries on the foreign fields give them fruit for their labor father we ask your blessings in the service you take over Lord and you be the active one in Jesus name we pray amen so the Bible tells us in 1st Corinthians 10 let's just read verse 11 save time now all these things happened unto them for examples and they are written for our admonition so who are they written for they're written for us me I put my name in there they're written for way Dale I don't know about you but they're written for me for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing reading of the word we this journey that we're in okay all right let me read this here God used your kindness to all the precious family at spoken word Tabernacle Church we want to thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your kindness love offerings works of comfort and most importantly all of your prayers this is from sister Collins you know brother Collins passed away several weeks ago and this is from her we pray God will richly bless y'all I like her she's southern y'all and we hope to worship with y'all very soon we sure would love it too brother your lewis you're a go family Terence Dale family Richard Robert family Ryan bonnet family Charlotte Richard Marlo and all the other families that gave you will never know when I received y'all's blessings just how much that meant to me to remind me of his faithfulness god bless all of you in Jesus name sister Collins and family now that's his Esther here okay it's brother Tim Boetsch wife father passed away and we were down there to to be with him so to the other bride that was spoken word church brother and sister wait Dale's done sister Canard brother sister helm sister Rebecca acting sister Regina Ireland brother sister Maroons and all who gate thank you all for you love offering I pray for God richly bless you all sister Barbara Collins and family just pray for it she lost them she lose just the husband she lost a friend she lost a friend they were they were just friends from from when they were younger and we've known brother Collins since we were kids and better sister Collins has always been a they've always been there and now brother Collins is went on we don't question that the Lord knows what he's doing we don't so he took him on home actually didn't take him home he took him over in another dimension to be there we're not going home till with the future home ma'am so so he's over in a place of waiting waiting or what to get ready and then he's gonna step right back in here and he's gonna be instead about the truck I mean instead of being a big man we saw a picture of him when he first got mad and he looked kinda like that and he's about six three or four tall gentleman but he was like a stick but that's the way we'll see him because he was 18 years old 19 at that time so we just really thank God that he sent us a prophet that could go into that other dimension that could take that could tell us not a story I don't mean a story but he could make it so vivid you know why cuz he went there he went there he went across that curtain of time he experienced what we never experienced man tells us down through the ages man has told us you know mama granny they all said all granny's walking on streets that go hand-in-hand with Jesus no she's not right she's not oh they're setting it to feet it no they're not they're not even in heaven what we know is heaven but he took a prophet to go across the curtain of time because nobody's ever went over there and come back and told the truth maybe if some of these people see lights and they see green men and they see all this stuff but we had a man go across the curtain time come back that we believe and we know he saw what he saw because you know what it connects with the Bible it connects with all the scripture it connects with with Abraham and Sarah being turned back to a young man a woman right in the same way what I told you brother Tom have not heard me say this but when my wife went to the Baptist Church one time and they had a series called experiencing God well she brings home this book and this book has got this it looked like Rip Van Winkle on the front of the book ball headed long hair gray and a stick and he's looking like this and that's what that's what they think God looks like because the Bible called him the Ancient of Days and then he's got to be old because he was like way back under that's what kids think my God's never been an old man my God's been eighteen years old or twenty years old and when he was creating the world and the Stars I believe he was happy brother Brown said he said it was like a kid playing before the father door why playing with toys let there be and here happens this and let there be they'll here happens this and he's like ho I'm gonna paint that and I'm gonna put this over here and I'll make a Milky Way I don't believe God's not just somebody that stands there and has no personality such a person he's the only human there ever was to me at this point in time and we were made in His image and we're heading back to something but we got to get done with this first so let's turn the book of Esther but we go through the Burton we went through the journey of Abraham let me go through this real quick journey of Ruth's journey of Abraham and there's four parts of their journey there's four parts to your journey justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost and going on to adoption or going on to Ruth's having the child and Abraham producing seat and brother that's going to get into this talking about adoption but see once God calls you and you are a child of God or a Christian you're going to produce what you are I told the church I told somebody the other day we were downstairs talking and it was talking about how all these these secret things are being revealed you know I mean you politicians they're pulling stuff out of their life from way back when and they're doing this and they're doing that why it's time of Revelation you can't hide nothing you're going to produce if you are wheat seed you are going to produce wheat if you are tear seed or cuckoo bird you're going to produce cocklebur I didn't plant 40 something squash plants to get corn I wanted squash in abundance Jim's throwing things downstairs I'm sure there's a story behind that but but I didn't you look at the end Bob kind of covered it when you look and you see you're going to produce who you are you can't help it same way with this virus and all these other things hey you're gonna we're going to produce who we are we're going to prove who we are and you know what God is pleased as he took Jesus on that mountain and said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell here you him he took brother branham up on that mountain out there in Arizona and he said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell took him up in a constellation of angels and gave him Commission to go back to Jeffersonville to have the seals open to me I I know that was I hear you him because you're not gonna get the revelation of that from anybody else Clarence Larkin can have his views and all these different people so and so can have their views but that's okay God sent one prophet and we're to listen to that one prophet but what he done though he didn't take it all with him he gave it to what us to produce what he is has preached he spent eleven hundred and something sermons to just leave and just not nothing happened no we're here to produce what that Bible said and through that prophet we're going to see here extra would have not been we'll get to it second extra would have not been anything if she hadn't had guidance from the different players in the story the memucan x' and the different ones and the different people Haggai and all the different ones and then here pops Mordecai which she has complete confidence in Mordecai that's why I said today that we see that brother branham's the confidence that people have in brother Branham or waning dirt they're just giving up they're saying well he's not true and he did this and he did that and and I really don't care he took me to Jesus Christ amen he took me to Jesus Christ I I'm not worried about if he missed a date and I don't think he did but they just don't understand they just don't understand cuz I'm gonna tell you something brother right if if if brother Ron what that's the messenger we got to find another one so we might as well just scrap what we got and go back to the Baptist telling you if you're looking for something else something good her I ain't enough no good or net this message shows me Jesus Christ this message that opened my eyes and give me a revelation that my walk in my journey is true justification and sanctification the baptism of Holy Ghost and not just sit back and enjoy no we have a commission to go forward we have a commission to finish this thing we do have this commission so now as we looked in at the four combat base we know that's the line locks men and Eagle we know that's that's your Holy Ghost so there's four combat beasts to help you through life now let's go - we went to Ruth we had characters in route that were Naomi was the old Jewish Church orful was the denominational Church Ruth was a Gentile bride and Boaz as a type of Christ and we see what happened in her journey all you gotta do is read it I gotta do is read it see then we know that we go all the way to Esther and after there was a king there was extra which turned into the bride bast I was the church Mordecai was the little prophet man or the little guy that hung around and and kind of guided Esther into what to do and we'll get into that just a second and then Haman was the devil and what last Sunday that's what we came up to as Haman and and I appreciate people like brother Ryan in different ones I love you comments I love somebody say you have preached a good sermon a man who said that that's what I thought no but brother Ron sends me a note sometimes in the middle of the week and he said hey do you know what he said you know that Haman came in Esther chapter three verse one and said that in Genesis chapter three verse one the serpent was talked about and see you you see that and you see well at least somebody's you know digging and looking because in Genesis 3:1 the Bible says the serpent was more subtle than any beast in the field and now we read extra 3:1 and here's Haman which is the type of the devil alright so we see that let's start right there we know one thing's for sure we know that Esther is now the queen that she has been accepted she's the queen but there's a problem going on here because her people are getting ready to be annihilated and she's gonna have to do something that had never been done before and somebody live because you can't go in to see the King without being invited I don't even care if you I don't even care if you're the bride I don't care for you the Queen the Queen doesn't just automatically go into the throne room nope she does not because she will die so here we are at chapter 3 verse 1 and then we've seen that Haman and we saw and showed that his lineage was all the way back to Esau our Amalek so we see how his limit lineage is coming up but now remember Mordecai didn't bow to him either as you keep going up down through there you look at verse 2 then then verse 5 but that made the devil listen the devil hates anybody that has truth he hates anybody that has truth and he hasn't he hasn't lost that character cuz why do that why did he go to Adam and Eve wanted to go to eat first he was gonna Mar her character he was going to get her to do something that God told him not to do so here is Haman Haman is trying to get the King to do something that if that the King now we know one thing's for sure that God Almighty knew everything that was going to happen because he predestinated it by his foreknowledge so he foreknew that means that come first and brother death will cover that a little bit later but by foreknowledge gotten you everything but now this King Denton but he put Haman in power in verse 10 he gave him power which is a permitted power because he gave he gave the devil there in Ezekiel he said I made you perfect you're the king you're the son of the morning you're the you're the morning cherub you're the I'm gonna let you be my right-hand man he said but he said evil was found in your heart or iniquity was found in your heart and that's the same thing with Haman Haman acted like he was doing a good deed to the king but his underlying meaning was he wanted to destroy the Jews because he knows Mordecai the Jew and Mordecai is not going to bow to him Mordecai what he didn't bow and then what happened was then then we took and see that the letters there was letters sent out then to destroy the Jews in one day now look at chapter 4 and we know what happened we look at Nazi a Roman and we we talk about it a lot but you know what happened at that time during Nicaea Rome Satan was trying to destroy Christianity it looked like to the world that he was that God was setting up Christianity because everybody talks about the the Nicene council in the three the three you know 325 AD in the 606 and boy they made they brought that doctrine out of father son Holy Ghost and the Trinitarian doctrine and they got everything together and man they made everything fit that was the devil's work God wasn't nowhere in that that's the same way with haman haman's coming up and he's trying his best to kill a group of people but he's doing it diplomatically because he said oh there's a group of people that don't like us and there's a group of people that don't do what we say to do that's the same way they were doing it and I see him because Constantine and all them were what they were killing Christians because they wouldn't be Catholics so the devil doesn't change his tactics e now in Chapter four more to come perceived all that was done more to kind of rent his clothes now see Mordecai finds this out first extra didn't find it out first Mordecai found it out first the little man he perceived I discern that there's something going on because listen like I said before and don't get me wrong the Prophet to God had to restore all the things back to the faith of the fathers there's no doubt but that wasn't his message his message wasn't even the healing campaign now I'll bring you a hundred quotes where he said that he said not in the healing campaign not when it first started but what when the opening of the seals when he comes down to a place to where he has authority to speak where no man has ever spoke before and then so Mordecai is gonna have to do the same thing Mordecai was gonna have to come to a place because remember Mordecai was really nothing he just stands at the Kings gate in other words he's at the right place at the right time and he hears these things why did God send a prophet because man said God spoke to me then this other man said God spoke to me then this other man said God spoke to me and they all three have different views God is not confused so God sent us a prophet and said hear him that's the one you gotta have to get it from so there wasn't emoticon and two three other guys Mordecai was in this story Mordecai is very important very important because Esther Denton Esther's actually not in the palace when the king makes this decree and he doesn't really understand that he made a decree to kill Esther's people right that's how the devil is he's real slick but you know what if God knows everything God is gonna use all that to destroy the devil because you were gonna say as we were talking about last Sunday Haman is going to come to a place to where he's gonna hate Mordecai so bad he's gonna build the Gallo and he thinks he's gonna hang Mordecai on it but guess what happens yeah he's got it coming listen he's got it coming let him do what he do he can't touch us until God's finished with us but when God's finished with us and we step out of here there's gonna be some hanging all right Mordechai perceived all that was done more to kind of rent his clothes and put on sackcloth and ashes think about a prophet of God nice thing about this a while back you look at Mordechai and remember more - cos did you but Mordechai is he's all the time interceding for Esther and his people he's always around the Kings gate he's always like I said in the right place at the right time and I was thinking about brother Branham and all the things he had to go through I mean the man the man died before I'm fit I'm 60 years old and he was 56 when he died somewhere in there and he looked really old why because he he told his whole life to get a message to me and you he spent his whole life gave up a lot of things same way with this Mordecai Mordecai went off doing something else know he was in the important place at the right time got the correct message interpretation and he always sent it dester always sent it to astor cuz you look right here look and he came before the Kings gate for none might enter into the Kings gate close what's that close so we going down a little bit further look at verse 4 so Esther's maid and her Chamberlain's came and told it to her what that Haman was out here toiling had his clothes off and he had ashes all over him all right so that's the way they mourned and grieved and she went with Raymond and clothed Mordecai anyway then called Esther for hate that's one of the Kings Chamberlain so anyway the story goes is this finally he tells her what's fixing to happen he gives her a revelation that she's gonna die if something's not happening they'll be okay with that you got Mordecai that Mordecai is going to tell Esther what's fixing to happen so if he does that now there's one thing for sure and with this chapter four and five is it's very beautiful if you'll look at it I know it may bore some of you but I enjoy reading and I've preached this 20 times and I really enjoy it again but what you do is you look at Mordecai now watch Mordecai is in desperation because one thing's for sure now here get get me right on this Mordecai becomes unimportant when he tells Esther what's going on now listen to what I'm saying the reason he does is it's because he can't go into the sea the king but Esther can that's me and you folks and is that by design it's not that by we're belittling anyone but we see this story and it's a perfect story of what brother Branham did he he couldn't he couldn't go in there with you know a lot of people never mind he wasn't God we know that but even in a story of Elly's or when Rebecca and Isaac got together they wasn't three in that tent that was only two so in other words the same way you Mordecai didn't go in with Esther and walk into that Court no he had to give extra the message and then Esther went to the king amen so that's the way you and I that's the way it's got to work that's the way it's worked in the Bible and that's the way it works with us mmm because we're taking everything that the prophet of God gave us and what we're doing is is we're producing a bride for Christ because brother I'm can't save nobody brother Dale can't save nobody I can't save anybody right as is important as Jesus Christ was he never saved one person while he was on the earth amen but now he came back on the day of Pentecost and saved 120 and one little WAC and then a 3,000 own down a little bit further that's how the way God wants to work he has messengers along the way to give you a swath fivefold ministry he gives us a fivefold ministry like I said before many of you young people don't know what a roadmap is but I know brother Tommen is just Rebekah know what a roadmap remember the old map said she couldn't ever get back together he still got them okey-dokey then so anyway but what is a road map a road map is folded and if you can't unfold the whole Road map what if you miss about three states and you can't get it all unfolded you don't know where to go but a fivefold ministry when God unfolds that fivefold map you know exactly where you going what brother Graham say it was no where you come from what you're doing here and where you're going now that's to me the plainest this message was given to tell me where I came from the mind of God like brother Dale's talking about how many preachers you ever heard Satan you come from the mind of God before brother Branham nobody but he tells us he said little bride you come from here this is what you're doing here and this is where you're going Esther you got some work to do because you know what I can't go in to see the king but you can so watch what happens now watch let's go down to let's go to verse 13 if you don't learn when Mordecai commanded to answer Esther think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house more than all the Jews for if thou altogether holdest thy peace in other words if we would have just took brother Browns message and thought he was just another preacher in another line like Larkin and all and not say anything bad about any of them but they didn't have a message this man had a vindicated message Mordecai had a vindicated message but he said in other words without reading this all he's saying Esther if you don't take this serious and go into that King you're gonna die that's what I would have happened if we would have just read you know there's a lot of people and I know what sister clida was in brother Browns meetings and maybe some of the brother Howell Thomas was and maybe some of the other ones were in the meeting broke Tony was in the mean so you saw the prophet of God oh and sister I'm sorry sister Marjorie she said her name's Tootsie not anymore no see anymore I don't know her to see for 60 something years okay sister Marjorie they were there they they watched the prophet work but my point is many people saw that and never went anywhere further he was just a good preacher he had a healing ministry and and and and left right but look at you you we we got people scattered in here and and brother motes saw him brother Joe Canada's own sister Esther dad saw him and and mother saw brother branham and then they went on because they caught the message they caught what Mordechai would say it that if it don't produce a bride if it don't produce a bride you're dead if this thing don't produce a bride they can go into the King I thought the Bible told us we can go boldly to the throne of grace not have to worry about having to sneak in the back door to get in to see the king no sir but now I'm telling you though Mordecai told her right here it says look you got to make a choice verse 14 if thou altogether holdest I peace at this time then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this Mordecai is looking her in the eye and going this is your moment this is your time you were born for this your whole journey has come right down to this right here put your name in that your whole journey brother how you've been in a mess a year sister Clara this is your time Esther this is important listen to what I'm saying who know it's whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this then extra bade them return more to count this answer say go gather all the Jews that are present in the palace and fast you for me neither eat nor drink three days neither day and I also in my maiden will fast likewise because remember if you're not called by the king and you walk into his chamber you're dead I don't care if your queen beautiful everybody got that so listen there's an order to go to the king and watch what she did I also in my maiden will fast like once and so will I go in unto the king which is not according to the law and if I perish I perish now watch so Mordecai went his way and did according to all that extra had commanded him so now Esther's in control but now Mordecai transferred that power to her alright it's you you were born for this day and she said I'm going in by Dada can we be that sold out to dial to our self now let's go to extra chapter 5 that came to pass on here we go on the third day that Esther but on her royal apparel she dressed right she knew listen listen she didn't go in there and grab her t-shirt that she had been working in the garden with and her blue jean skirt then that holds in it she knew what the King liked because she knew the King no other woman and that whole Palace would know exactly how to dress except the Queen and she put on her apparel that she knew now you'll see it in the story in just a minute because listen folks oh it's thrills my heart Jesus hadn't seen his bride in three in two thousand years he's never looked he's never put physical eyes on his bride humanized to humanize he's had to wait 2,000 years for us to learn how to dress right for us to learn how to act right and for us to be able to approach the king because when Esther shows herself to the king he's not mad he's not saying why didn't you do this why didn't you don't do that while you've wife I know he longed to see her coz watch now it came to pass on the third day that extra put on her royal apparel and stood in the inner court of the king's house over against the king's house and the King sat upon his royal throne in the royal house over against the gate of the house and it was so when the King saw Esther the Queen standing in the court oh man how could he refuse her she was dressed right she was on both she was acting right that she obtained favor in his sight and the King held out to Esther because remember if that golden scepter didn't go out and if she didn't touch that gold and scepter the people standing around the King took her and immediately killed her but he held out what he hold out he held out listen to this that golden scepter if you'll go back and look at during that time that golden scepter they didn't know what it meant but there was a cross on top of that golden scepter and when he held that scepter out you know what he said he said I died for you I died for you I'm not gonna kill you I died for you I'm so glad to see you I can't kill you so Esther drew near and touch the top of the scepter then said to King unto her look what are you doing here what's your problem no he said what do you want and what is thy request and it shall be even now he didn't know what she was doing in there but he's ready to give her half the kingdom up to half and you know all I had to do was say okay you can have the kingdom what a mighty God we serve because now watch this story we may not get we won't get to it today because I'm gonna cut it off but we'll get to it next week he asked her this three times but what happens on the fourth time keep reading your Bible about chapter eight or nine over in there he says Esther what do you want you can have the whole kingdom he's offering her half she's in her journey but when he gets to the very end he's so in love with her he's like whatever you want you get all this revelation chapter five your kings and priests you reign over this place it's yours but we have to go through a journey then the king said inner what will thou Queen Esther what is our request and it shall even even given thee to the half of the kingdom now what's extra do extra is not going to say bride he's not going to say this Haman guys he's pretty bad if you see the underlying meaning Esther has a plan because how is the devil gonna be destroyed through the king no he's already destroyed death how's he gonna house house Haman gonna come to his end there had to be an Esther to make sure that he comes to an end you see what you and I that's our purpose for being here is to destroy the effects of the devil when listen when death is destroyed in this body you have destroyed the devil so Esther is going I want to have a feast with you and Haman because I got a little story I need to tell you so X transfer say if it seemed good under the king let the king and Haman come this day into the banquet that I have prepared for him hmm you think it might be a nice feast we'll see here in just a second the king sent an Astra at the banquet of wine now watch here we go here's number to roll it up to number six but this is number two where he offers her half the kingdom again then the King said into a stir at the banquet of one what is my petition it shall be granted then what is our request even to the half of the kingdom that shall be performed then Esther then answered estrin said my petition and my request is this if I have found favor in the sign to the king and if it please the King to grant my petition and to perform my request let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them and I will do tomorrow as the king has said now watch what happened then went Haman because I want you to look at this and see there's something there's something going on we see this because we're going to see in Chapter six because look Haman went forth that day joyful and with a glad heart oh he's gonna get to the bride he's gonna get to Esther he's gonna come to her feast and she's gonna glorify him and she's gonna make him so nice of a meal then went Haman forth that day joyful with a glad heart but when Haman saw Mordecai here we go in the Kings gate that he stood not up nor moved for him listen brother branham didn't compromise on nothing he knew who the devil was knew what his tactic was and he never bowed down to him nor moved for him he was full of evening nation against more to come nevertheless Haman refrained himself then he came home and he went to see his with a wifey and started crying well why does he do he what's his wife his churches he went to his churches Satan went home to his churches and he starts giving them this pill and Haman told them of the glory of his riches in the multitude of his children and all the things were in the King had promoted him because he he thinks he's really going to get promoted him and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the King and God did God put Satan in a place y'all don't you understand that Satan had a position beyond the brother brother said all but creation Satan could do so that's pretty powerful but you see what he done he allowed Satan to do that so that you and I could come forth but he had to make him a redeemer to make him what this King is fixing to redeem a group of people that are fixing to be killed because of Haman and Heyman said moreover yeah after the Queen didn't let no man come in with the King into the banquet that she is prepared but myself and tomorrow I'm gonna be the head dog and DeMar am I invited unto her also with the King yet all this availeth mean nothing so long as I see that Mordecai the Jew sitting at the Kings gate listen folks don't you think Satan was fat and happy during the ages when all the denominations came in and and they started baptizing them wrong and they started to have at least folks Satan was just like I mean he's like I had no gran here I got them all whipped and then God sends a little prophet and in about the 30s and the 40s and the 50s he starts having healing campaigns and knocking the devil in the head and and then in the 60s when the seals open that's a whole something Satan ain't got a thing to deal with to do with don't you think it made him mad sure it made him mad but he went back to his denominational wife and he's telling them says look we're gonna do something here and we're gonna kill this guy let a gal be made of 50 cubits tomorrow speaking to the king that Mordecai maybe hang to their own then go thou merrily with the king into the banquet and the theme please Haman now who said that his wife his church his church says aye you go out there and tell that william branham got he he's not invited in our churches no more okay and the theme please Haman and he calls the gallows to be made so watch Esther chapter 6 what's what happens so what happens is in the story and we'll stop right here because I don't want to be too long we got a long day today because I want to wait till we get to chapter 7 Ryan wants to look at chapter 7 chapter 7 we see something happen in chapter 8 the sevens in the eighth alright so chapter six on that night could not the king sleep and he commanded to bring the book of records of Chronicles and they were read before the king now remember back in the story Mordecai had listened to these two people that were going to kill the king they conspired to kill the king and Mordecai brought it to the attention of the king through the Chamberlain's through the preachers that there was something going to happen and they were going to kill this king so verse three says then the king said what honor and dignity have been done to Mordecai for this in other words has anybody done anything for this guy he saved my life he saved my whole church he saved my bride he saved a lot of things and then everybody around him said well there ain't nothing been done for him and the King said who is in the court now watch the devil is always around somewhere he's always right there in the court remember he's the accuser of the Brethren remember so he can get an audience with God when sometimes we think we can't but remember you're a child of God there's a difference you're a child of God and the King said who's in the court now Haman was coming to the outward Court of the king now why is he coming for he's going to convince the King to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had already made all the little traps that the devil has for all of us remember brother Branham said money women in popularity you're going to get trapped by one of them but he never was and the king's servants said unto Him behold Haman standeth in the court and the King said let him come in so Haman come in and the King said unto him what shall be done into the man whom the King delighted to honor now Haman thought he's fixing to do something for me he's fixing to give me a crown I'm his right-hand guy there is no other can't be it can't be that's scourge out there Mordecai can't be that guy and Haman thought in his heart to whom with the King delight to do honor more than me now if you don't believe Haman is gonna hang yourself you don't believe the devil is gonna hang yourself watch this story and Haman answered the King for the man whom the King delighted to honor let the royal apparel be brought which the King used it to wear and in other words the finest horse in Arabia that the King rides on and the crown royal which was set upon he's fixing to give him the Kings apparel not just some Lord or some little no King stuff and let this apparently I just put it on him now I want people to see me Haman riding on this horse with the crown and I want people to glorify me you see where Satan fell from and let this apparel and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the Kings most noble princess that they may have read this man with all whom the King delighteth to honor and bring him on horseback through the streets of the city and let him go around the world seven times and proclaim before him thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighted to honor then the king said good idea make haste don't wait Lamar make haste and take that apparel and that horse as thou has said and do even soda can you hear the balloon go tous remember listen in this whole story y'all don't don't forget Satan thinks he's got the upper hand even now he thinks he can destroy all the way down to almost to the future home he still thinks he can win this thing if he can accuse enough other people but God's gonna use him to display his bride then took Haman while anyway that sitteth at the Kings gate let nothing fail of all the tile has spoken I bet you he if he could eat his words then took Haman the apparel and the horse don't you think he hated putting that on Mordecai don't you think he hated putting him up on that horse and guess what he's the guy that led them through the city and brought him on horseback through the street of the city and proclaimed before him the celebi done another man who became to lies the owner and Mordecai came again to the Kings gate but Haman hasted to his house bless his heart was you I was you woo the jewels things and having his head covered that's the way I want the devil to be I want him to tuck tail and run I don't want him nowhere around me and Haman cáceres his wife and all his friends everything that had befallen him crying big tears then said his wise men azerath his wife if Mordecai be at the seat of the Jews before before whom thou has begun to fall thou shalt not prevail against him but shall surely fall before him and while they were yet talking to him came to King's Chamberlain's and hasted to bring Haman into the banquet that Esther had prepared now remember they're fit he's got to go to a banquet now with Esther and the king it just gets worse and worse and better for us but worse for them but let's just read this just for a minute and we'll close right here so the king and Haman came to the banquet with Esther the Queen because remember in the seventh church age Satan is destroyed right through the message of the hour through the bride of Jesus Christ Satan is destroyed has no effect on us supposed to not be when we come to this position of adoption and on to the change of the body so watch this Esther chapter 7 we'll read this and then we'll be finished we'll pick the rest up next week so the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the Queen and the King said again into Esther on the second day of the banquet of wine what is that position position Queen Esther and it shall be granted unto them what is our request it shall be performed even to the half of the kingdom that was the third time he said that everybody got that that was the third time that he made mention hmm the third time then Esther the Queen answered and said if I have found favor in thy sight O king and if it please the King let my life be given me at my petition and my people ah revelation he's fixing to tell the King she's fixing to tell the King she's a Jew but he loved her so much he didn't care remember we flipped that to the other side we're Gentiles we're dogs we were not we were not we didn't have no we don't have any inheritance but when God married us that's when we got an inheritance for we are sold I and my people to be destroyed to be slain into perish but if we had been sold for bombing and bond women I had held my tongue although the enemy could not counter veil the Kings damage so then what he said we'll wait a minute what have I done in other words then the King a source answered to senator Esther the Queen who is he and where is he that Durst presume in his heart to do this because where is all this mysterious coming from it's coming from Satan's heart it's coming from the devil now remember King asaurus God can't change his word the law of the Medes and Persians you cannot want the laws been written you can't change it and if you take this by just the letter it will kill you this Bible will either send you to heaven or I'll send you to hell one of the two all right because God can't change it because of your little situation or mine but watch what he says right here real quick and Esther said the adversary and the enemy is this wicked Haman now listen the King never questioned her one time he believed what she said then Haman was afraid for the King and before the king and the Queen so that's what we do we expose the devil and the King arising from the bank of the wine in his wrath went into the palace garden and Haman stood up to make requests for his life to the king Oh what's your Bible say sister Trudy oh he didn't even country it listen if it had been me I went to the game cuz that dudes the ones with the power Yeah right he knew though if he could change the extras mind he could she could change the Kings mind so he's coming to the bride to try to make us change our mind about his word and Haman stood up to make requests for his life too Esther the Queen for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king then the King returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine and what did Haman do he fell down in the bed trying to get in bed with Esther and I just made God worse man that wasn't good English was it Oh point ya got spawn cross Bennett Haman was falling he's bagging a stir he knows his end is near like the devil now he knows his end is near then said the king will he force the Queen before me in my own house as the word went out of the Kings mouth they covered Heyman's face now when you cover somebody's face its execution always always and harbona one of the Chamberlain said before they came behold also the gap hey we got a Gallo out here where that come from the devil built it but the devil built all this which Haman made for Mordecai who had spoken good for the King standeth in the house of Haman then the king said hang him their own so they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai then was the King's wrath pacified the Devils got it coming to him folks and it's not coming from the king it's coming from the Queen because the Queen right now to me on this earth is the most powerful force there is is the bride of Jesus Christ on this earth today musicians come and then we'll continue the story because look Louis chapter 8 was they mean eternity we're gonna go into something here in just a minute because remember the ring that he gave to Haman he's fixing to give it to somebody else because he's got some more confidence in this man named Mordecai and then we're gonna see it's kind of real it's not funny but we're not finished with Haman exactly because he had ten sons ten that was ten preachers twelve preachers went across the promised land right never mind sermon I preached a long time ago on ten line preachers they get hung to so God's gonna listen God's gonna purge this thing how is he gonna do it by the bride of Jesus Christ no one else and we know you say well you're making God not important he's standing back he said Esther you prepare a feast after I'm gonna bring this person in here he says hey you get half the kingdom whatever you want and then we're gonna see just about two more chapters from now Kings gonna turn around and say what do you want the whole kingdom is yours listen this world is not my home I'm just a passing through my treasures are laid up but you know what it is it's not somewhere beyond the blue we had a prophet remind us that we're coming back to here sister Marjorie this is our home Haman is a squatter it's not his Haman thought he was so powerful he only had permitted power Satan only has permitted power to do what he needs to do but it all goes for the glory of Almighty God through the bride of Jesus Christ let's stand to our feet god bless you I just love the book of Esther eyes just a man got all kind of good nuggets in it no go ahead let's sing a song I was saying you came from the me how we gave it life long cavalry to save a wretch like me is ruining this precious blood tone you know he did all that though so he could transfer all that power over to his little queen his little bride in the end time it was looking he was looking at me and you to finish this thing up he's looking for an answer to not be afraid to walk into the palace and to boldly come before the throne of God and to ask your petition not half of what you need but all that you need anything you need today you just ask God you ask your king extra just ask and you shall receive [Music] [Applause] how we made a lane to walk again you'll abort any cause of life to see and then I cried dear Jesus Lord helmet guns baron yourself says somehow but we know how we know how he did it all victory in Jesus my Savior forever he saw me and he bought me with his redeeming love he loved me ere I knew him Hey people lunge me brother branham tell us what is God's victory it's the bride it's us we are his victory it's an old story about a man dying on a cross but unless he's made real - me and you it's just they hung many people that day the next day and the day after there was people hung every day or put on a tree at Calvary but that guy he was special he could come back and get inside of somebody the rest of them died and went on away and history didn't even talk about him they just grew their body over into a pit and covering them up but this man walked out on the third day he walked out of that tomb and he said all power in heaven and earth been given unto me and I'm fixing to transfer it to a group of people just several days later on the day of Pentecost you know if if the devil would have been smart he could have just let Jesus live well Tom he could just let Jesus live and he would just live this life on out and heat some worry they had to die cold his body wasn't eternal but Heyman couldn't stand it he had to think he was in control he had to say if I can get that man and get him a pen kill him I got him whipped he just didn't realize that was part of the plan that that King did get on the cross and die for me and you and then a few days later several weeks later 50 days and a damn Pentecost guess what he had to deal with 120 little jesus' and then they went out and preached a sermon and three thousand although jesus' were born everything satan touches he just can't get it right but that's the same way with that look how that calamity of Haman how he went through and thought all this whole time he was gonna be put right here and God the whole time knew he would trap his own self and get hung on the same trap that he had made [Music] Satan's a bluff he has no power except what we give it to him and you need to quit taking up rattlesnake his brother Bernie always said stop taking it refused it refused this sickness refused all this stuff that's going around but you pray because next Sunday we're gonna start having regular service we'll get rid of that blue tape thank the Lord what you pray and God bless you if that he'll give you the Bible says the desire of your heart and God's you only one that knows your heart so if you have a good desire a desire to come to church a desire to worship God not just doing it because you have to then this virus has no no hold on us when we do that because he said he give you the desire of your heart there are sins that stands that king with that scepter out he says whatever you need I've already paid for it I got a big army behind me but you're my queen and I want you to come and sit beside me because remember we're told that we can we'll be able to sit in the throne with him in the Millenium and all the way through into eternity that's our position so god bless you we'll get ready to go downstairs back first
