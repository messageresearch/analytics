[5:42] us to understand what we need to speak
[5:45] about because that we can take a topic
[5:47] when you take a thought but yet within
[5:50] that it's what we need to have and we
[5:53] pray you would help us to understand
[5:55] forgive our sins and lead us by thy
[5:57] grace in Jesus name
[6:10] Matthew 24 will begin verse 15 we
[6:14] therefore shall see the abomination of
[6:16] desolation spoken of by Daniel the
[6:19] prophet standing in the Holy Place whoso
[6:22] readeth let him understand that not them
[6:26] which are in Judea flee let them which
[6:30] are be in Judea flee into the mountains
[6:33] let him which be on the housetop not
[6:36] come down to take anything out of this
[6:39] house neither let him which is in the
[6:42] field return back to take his clothes
[6:44] you remember how we were bringing out
[6:46] verse 15 brings out the mosque of Omar
[6:49] then you get up to the sixteen and I
[6:52] like that you started talking about when
[6:54] Titus come into Jerusalem in AD 70 and
[6:58] those that were caught inside the city
[7:01] see they were told to leave this is
[7:04] telling them to get out and they said
[7:06] there was no record of any true
[7:08] Christian left in and that's brother
[7:11] Evans wording left in Jerusalem because
[7:14] they all fled you know for safety okay
[7:20] need to let him which be in the field
[7:22] return back to take his clothes well and
[7:25] woe unto them that are with child and to
[7:28] them that give suck in those days he'd
[7:30] be hard travelling hard moving in in all
[7:32] the doings all right we pray that your
[7:35] flight be not in the winter neither on
[7:38] the Sabbath day because the Judean heals
[7:41] I think would be covered over at that
[7:43] time so pray that that wouldn't happen
[7:45] well then shall the Great Tribulation
[7:47] such as was not since the beginning of
[7:51] the world to this time no nor ever shall
[7:54] be and except those days should be
[7:57] shortened there should no flesh be saved
[7:59] but for the elects sake those days shall
[8:02] be shortened then if any man shall say
[8:06] unto you lo here is Christ coming alway
[8:11] down out of where we're at all right
[8:14] there believe it not for there shall
[8:17] arise false Christ's and false prophets
[8:20] and shall show great signs and wonders
[8:23] in so much that if it were possible they
[8:26] shall deceive the very elect and brother
[8:29] Brennan said now he would get it so
[8:32] tight up until he cut to work short all
[8:36] right now remember what I'm saying about
[8:38] the words short
[8:39] it looks like saying it that way that he
[8:42] was intended for it to lives 40 more
[8:44] years when he's going to stop it that's
[8:46] not the point you remember years ago
[8:49] when we started doing it where the Bible
[8:52] speaks of he'd do a short work you
[8:57] murder scripture said he'd do a short
[8:58] work
[8:59] cut it short and righteousness that word
[9:01] work is word look it up Andy Dixon
[9:06] looking up near in quarters
[9:08] it means word he's not going to cut
[9:11] shorts on he's going to pour the word in
[9:15] you understand he's going to pour the
[9:18] word in and make it work um in real
[9:20] feist in the last days called it's a
[9:23] short word that he's going to do not a
[9:25] short work in cutting days off the the
[9:28] great eternal God wouldn't be doing that
[9:30] away you know it's not but that you know
[9:33] I think about that that he does it we'll
[9:36] do a short word all right behold I have
[9:40] told you before we're if we're for if
[9:45] that you don't say unto you behold he is
[9:48] in the desert go not forth he is in the
[9:52] secret chambers believe it not where is
[9:55] the Lightning cometh out of the east and
[9:57] Shina 'the even unto the West so shall
[10:00] also the coming of the Son of man be for
[10:04] so ever the carcass is there will
[10:07] evils be gathered together you may be
[10:09] seated the Lord at his blessing to the
[10:12] reading of the word many of you probably
[10:13] remembers a man one time they used to
[10:18] you know but around confirms there's
[10:21] about forty something different kind of
[10:22] Eagles they are such thing is vulture
[10:25] Eagles all right and you know Brett
[10:29] around them confirms that and this
[10:30] Pentecostal preacher was making fun of
[10:32] me there at work about it and see they
[10:35] call me uh
[10:37] the head eagle you know and because of
[10:40] this trying to gather a group to that
[10:42] you know in the fight but I told him I
[10:44] said now you can make four hundred me I
[10:47] talked to him personally quite there's a
[10:49] Pentecostal preacher of it
[10:50] I said you can make fun of me all you
[10:53] want to and I said I know about the
[10:57] forty something different kind of Eagles
[10:59] I said there were it's vulture Eagles I
[11:03] admit that but that also means they're
[11:06] true legals alright and I said now
[11:10] you're a preacher and I knew it said I
[11:14] said I know your church teaching on that
[11:17] Scripture I said your turret your church
[11:21] teaching is that's the coming of the
[11:24] Lord and he just backed off and he said
[11:28] I'll never say another word about you
[11:32] okay thank you
[11:33] don't you see that's what that's talking
[11:35] about this is talking about the coming
[11:38] of the Lord where the carcass is the
[11:41] Eagles would be gathered where the Word
[11:43] of God is your children will gather to
[11:46] that word all right now watch it when we
[11:49] get over to where we're going to in stop
[11:52] to not in the message at a little point
[11:55] of brother branham selling us that with
[11:58] this part we're talking about the
[12:01] anointing we can find out whether we are
[12:05] seed or weeds all right then we'll get
[12:13] to that if we can get get to the point
[12:15] but I want you to think on on those
[12:17] things all right now so that would be
[12:23] false christs
[12:24] in the last days all right read that
[12:29] over and over and over about it because
[12:31] even just reading at one time you you
[12:34] don't get what you need keep reading it
[12:36] until you in you know until you see what
[12:40] all of it's talking about all right
[12:43] and then it's the fulfillment of the
[12:46] Scriptures yeah we know that where the
[12:50] carcass is equal to be getting on all
[12:52] that's the fulfillment of the scriptures
[12:53] and all that what we were we're just
[12:55] reading the parts of it too you know
[12:57] where it talks about the Christ don't go
[13:00] after it in other words don't go after
[13:03] all of these false doctrines all right
[13:06] you remember how that we brought out
[13:08] Deuteronomy the other day in the life
[13:10] services all right they didn't
[13:13] Deuteronomy it talks about how that he
[13:16] would bring among the people allow these
[13:19] things to happen that false prophets
[13:22] would come and said if they preached to
[13:26] you in other words and said it comes to
[13:29] pies but said if they lead you to
[13:33] another God don't believe them another
[13:36] message another thought not another God
[13:39] another thought another doctrine another
[13:43] idea like the people of this message see
[13:45] that they'll take brother brems message
[13:47] and twist it and make another doctrine
[13:49] another idea but remember what is it
[13:52] Galatians 1:8 that there can't be but
[13:55] one gospel there's not but one truth all
[13:59] right so then we should settle into that
[14:02] point of following the truth
[14:06] the message of the hour and not getting
[14:10] tied up in all of this other because
[14:12] that is part of what God is allowed he
[14:14] would allow it says there in Deuteronomy
[14:16] he would bring these among us to trash
[14:19] brother Brent said he would do it to
[14:22] find out if whether we'd stay with the
[14:23] truth or not you mean God will allow
[14:25] these things to happen to his children
[14:28] yes to see whether or not we're his
[14:32] children see whether or not we'll stay
[14:35] with what he's saying
[14:37] or take some thoughts of our own Rydia
[14:40] the room and you see today in the mass
[14:42] destruction across the land with the
[14:44] people we're doing it when the Bible
[14:46] says that they must needs be heresies
[14:49] among you that they that are approved
[14:51] may be made manifest manifested to make
[14:55] known these things of coming in the last
[14:58] days to try me and you to see where they
[15:02] will stay with the truth or not all
[15:04] right and see that's going to be given
[15:07] it's give us all these years to try and
[15:11] see you it's got to be because the
[15:15] scripture speaks of how you you've got
[15:17] to be somewhere before you could fall
[15:19] away well that's where the people of the
[15:22] message fifty years of studying the
[15:24] message or something and then fall away
[15:26] see that scripture we shouldn't be
[15:29] downhearted about the hour that we're in
[15:33] if we see what's going on we should be
[15:37] rejoicing because some work is going to
[15:41] have to come to pass that all of this
[15:44] will be consummated or ever how you say
[15:46] it and it'll be it'll come back to the
[15:49] point that something's going to happen
[15:50] and praise God whatever you're looking
[15:54] for to happen whatever I'm looking for
[15:56] it to happen
[15:57] thank God bring it on let's see what
[16:00] it'll bring because it's going to take
[16:02] these things to praying that whatever
[16:07] you think it is it's gonna take the
[16:09] point of where that Satan is loosed to
[16:13] try the people
[16:15] and what about now if the Bible speaks
[16:17] over there because it's always been
[16:19] amazing to me when brother Brown spoke
[16:20] with those back there you know about so
[16:23] many hundred thousand everything he said
[16:25] it's meant to be loosed on the bride he
[16:30] said it was loosed on Israel to drive
[16:31] her to the homeland said it'll be loosed
[16:34] on the bride to drive her work to the
[16:36] message of the hour demons what about
[16:41] all the demons it was already dire and
[16:43] then what a two hundred thousand
[16:45] thousands there how many millions that
[16:47] would be you know is loosed on the bride
[16:50] to drive her to the homeland well I'll
[16:55] tell you one way you talk about God I
[16:57] don't like him too well
[16:59] well he's wanting to be a daddy he's
[17:04] wanting to be a father
[17:05] he's wanting to display himself and to
[17:09] show us how much he loves us and
[17:11] sometimes he has to spank us sometimes
[17:15] he has to whip us to get us to do I was
[17:18] thinking today about it now and think
[17:19] about all of us how much sickness is
[17:21] among us but you know what they ain't
[17:23] one now bad colds are I wish we could
[17:27] get in our mind the right way of looking
[17:29] at to me a bad cold or a sniffle or
[17:31] something like that
[17:32] I don't count that as the devil life to
[17:34] me boy I tell you what I blowed my nose
[17:37] twice yesterday devil must be after me
[17:39] uh that's that's getting a little too
[17:43] narrow I think but you know what they
[17:46] can't be one thing come on you if God
[17:49] don't permit it is that right I don't
[17:53] sound good does it
[17:55] hey brother I'm sick well the devils
[17:59] after us
[18:00] all right let's see if we don't realize
[18:04] it that way then we'll try to everything
[18:06] else okay
[18:08] all right just trying to get a little
[18:09] point now to us tonight in a thought
[18:12] that I have a really brother
[18:15] I'll take was striking on something and
[18:17] it just rolled over into work that I was
[18:20] speaking and I said oh okay that's good
[18:23] you know and so we'll just continue the
[18:26] thought all right now what about these
[18:30] that are false christs cuz that's what
[18:35] it's called them and Matthew 24 false
[18:39] christs all right now not meaning where
[18:44] the way we make it of false christs the
[18:50] as to the point of making it that the
[18:53] individual person can be wrong
[18:58] but the Christ is right we said we'll
[19:03] look at Balaam and how he was yes but
[19:09] look at him I looked at up finally the
[19:12] other day to work do it I wrote today
[19:14] I'm some so to me yeah baylin's
[19:18] prophecy you'll find it in in numbers 24
[19:21] one through five always said Balaam
[19:25] prophesied it's not necessarily
[19:26] prophesying of the coming of the Lord
[19:28] into that realm but it's close to it
[19:31] because that's what the Scriptures see
[19:33] Balaam prophesied it was even written in
[19:35] the Bible typhus prophesied I said it
[19:40] was necessary that one died for the sins
[19:42] of the people being High Priest brother
[19:44] Branham said the anointing came on him
[19:47] to testify that so then we're not
[19:52] looking at false Christ as to try to
[19:54] find some kind of hwangbang guy out here
[19:57] that claims you've got all this and all
[19:59] the others and and all kind of things
[20:01] happening but those things are happening
[20:02] and you know what there's gifts
[20:05] following those things now where's the
[20:09] gift comes from when I talk about bad
[20:14] gifts we're talking about real good
[20:16] gifts see we're going to get in to that
[20:21] point a little more when we finish that
[20:23] we'll get into the next message and
[20:25] that's why I won't kind of put it in a
[20:27] couple of message together though of how
[20:30] that we know what the prophet has told
[20:33] us that what the anointing is upon your
[20:38] spirit all right it's upon your spirit
[20:44] the anointing is upon your spirit it's
[20:47] not in your soul it's not on those bases
[20:52] and it works back out through that
[20:54] spiritual part out into the flesh so
[20:57] that's not the point
[20:58] but the anointing is on the spirit
[21:01] alright now remember what we read
[21:06] knew that that Christ would be so
[21:13] deceiving until it would almost deceive
[21:19] the elect now that's pretty strong
[21:24] that ain't no Baptist got here hollered
[21:27] we believe in three guards and you get
[21:29] up to heaven you ain't going to heaven
[21:31] and find this one sitting there that's
[21:32] gonna be three or four and all over the
[21:34] plug you need something like that here
[21:36] you got to get closer
[21:38] right see then that Christ see we always
[21:46] took anything that would be in any way
[21:51] relation to God would be good
[21:55] we could never consider even though the
[21:59] Bible would call it that I'm talking
[22:02] about we as people we would never
[22:05] consider that to be what the Prophet
[22:08] came out to teach it as being
[22:14] then it would turn out to be the genuine
[22:18] baptism of the Holy Spirit on your
[22:23] spirit and you still be lost no we
[22:29] always thought anybody shouted spoken
[22:31] tongues oh they've got a lot of problems
[22:33] or something anybody that claim to be a
[22:35] Christian come to our door shook hands
[22:36] with the preacher whatever you know we
[22:38] always come with him so Christians just
[22:41] got problems but just remember now the
[22:47] things that we talked about and knew
[22:49] don't never place the wrong thing upon
[22:52] God is doing and in heaven help you to
[22:55] try to figure out some way that God is
[22:57] doing these things to the line of it and
[22:59] it not line up with the word let him
[23:01] line it up let him say it let him say
[23:07] this is my army that I sent among you
[23:12] right see did he send the devil no he
[23:18] permitted the devil now you got it right
[23:22] you're not putting it in the wrong place
[23:23] you getting it in the right order so
[23:26] that's what we're we're supposed to be
[23:28] looking at but let's go to the scripture
[23:30] now and just see on this of the earth
[23:33] this day in coming forth from the Old
[23:36] Testament of the types and shadows then
[23:41] we can come to the New Testament code if
[23:43] you can't follow the anointing
[23:45] throughout the Old Testament so you'd
[23:48] never be able to understand how Moses
[23:50] could tell God a better way of doing
[23:51] something right you can't figure out
[23:56] those things back there that was in the
[23:57] Old Testament
[23:59] yeah unless you understand anointed ones
[24:04] and we're over here on this side with
[24:07] the Holy Ghost to not just be an
[24:10] anointing but to be a new birth
[24:16] but not to just be anointed with the
[24:19] Holy Spirit but to actually have the
[24:23] very life of Christ living within us but
[24:29] to understand what took place to bring
[24:31] it down so we come through the Old
[24:33] Testament down into the hour they were
[24:37] living so go ahead brothers and pull up
[24:40] number two on you your things are cuz I
[24:42] told them they didn't have no number one
[24:43] because these notes I've had them for
[24:46] about three weeks I guess and I still
[24:49] got a lot of a lot of you've got them if
[24:52] you held on but look what it says in in
[24:54] acts two they were all amazed now you
[24:59] know what happened here this is the
[25:00] coming of the Holy Ghost right when it
[25:04] fell under their Pentecost okay and they
[25:06] were all amazed and weird out we're in
[25:09] doubt send one to the other what meaneth
[25:11] this in other words what's what's taking
[25:13] place these things that are happening
[25:15] others Malkin said these men are full of
[25:17] new wine but Peter standing up with the
[25:20] eleven lifted up his voice and said unto
[25:23] them you men and brethren and all ye
[25:26] that dwell at Jerusalem be this known
[25:29] unto you and hearken to my words where
[25:32] these are not drunken as you suppose
[25:35] seeing these about the third hour of the
[25:38] day but this is that which was spoken of
[25:42] the Prophet Joel now the baptism of the
[25:47] holy ghost coming was spoken of by the
[25:49] Prophet Joel and it shall come to pass
[25:52] in the last days say if God I will pour
[25:55] out my spirit upon all flesh alright
[26:01] your sons and your daughters shall
[26:03] prophesy and your young men shall see
[26:06] visions and your old men shall dream
[26:09] dreams and on my servants and on my
[26:13] handmaids I will pour out in those days
[26:16] of my spirit and they shall prophesy and
[26:19] I'll show great wonders in heaven and
[26:21] all like that now watch
[26:24] keep in mind what it's saying our Porco
[26:27] we're going back to jaw pick that up but
[26:30] look it's poor from all flesh now that
[26:39] doesn't mean everybody's got the Holy
[26:41] Ghost
[26:42] or it's living in them right has nothing
[26:46] to do with that relationship
[26:48] it's pouring it out upon all flesh now
[26:54] look what it's saying I'll pour my
[26:57] spirit upon all flesh and your sons
[27:03] whatsit and your daughter's shall
[27:07] prophesy and your young men shall see
[27:10] visions and your old men shall dream
[27:12] dreams and on my servants here's your's
[27:21] and here's mine showing that's what I'm
[27:24] talking about showing that it'll be on
[27:27] all flesh it'll be poured out and all
[27:30] flesh shall be put to the basis that
[27:33] they can receive it it doesn't mean now
[27:36] I'm honest - try to say now - correct
[27:39] the scripture but I don't see everybody
[27:41] in the world getting anointing because
[27:45] you don't want to know what Judas and I
[27:47] mean all these over the owners and
[27:50] Buddhists and Hindus and Muslims and the
[27:52] things like that so you don't get all of
[27:55] that and you pull he's gonna pour it out
[27:57] on Oh flesh
[27:59] I remember one brother preaching here
[28:01] one time he he had that - going so much
[28:04] that he had the cabbage having the Holy
[28:06] Ghost
[28:07] I said now that's a little bit too far I
[28:10] don't think the cabbage is got it this
[28:13] you know but that's aura but look what
[28:16] it says see I pour it my spirit upon all
[28:18] flesh and your sons and your daughters
[28:20] shall prophesy and your young men shall
[28:25] see visions and old men shall dream
[28:29] dreams and on my servants and on my
[28:32] handmaids I will pour out in those days
[28:35] of my spirit and
[28:37] your prophesy okay what are you putting
[28:39] out on the hall now the Bible says that
[28:46] rain falls on the just and the unjust
[28:49] right now that's what it's talking about
[28:54] it's falling on we'll read that in a
[28:55] minute it's falling on all flesh not on
[28:59] everything that's doing the rain don't
[29:01] fall out there are those places in the
[29:03] world that hadn't had any rain in five
[29:05] hundred years probably so that's not you
[29:09] saying this come fall everywhere like
[29:10] falling everywhere get the right
[29:13] understanding of what we're talking
[29:15] about he's gonna pour it out on those
[29:19] that would receive it right all right
[29:23] now while we're at that point let's drop
[29:27] back there and just read it so we won't
[29:28] have the you know let's go back to to
[29:30] jaw and read that so that we won't won't
[29:34] mess up on that have you got it I know I
[29:38] didn't give it to you on these notes but
[29:40] I've got it in in the others but you
[29:42] know I was just gonna show you but this
[29:45] you got you got time to go back and read
[29:47] it yourself okay now listen
[29:51] pour out his spirit on all flesh meaning
[29:56] that it will be Jew and Gentile that's
[30:01] what it's meaning to pour it out on all
[30:03] flesh right so we're in a Gentile
[30:08] dispensation a Gentile dispensation
[30:11] means nations that can come in and
[30:15] receive all right the spirit can be
[30:17] poured out and it was poured out on the
[30:19] day of Pentecost and it was just a
[30:21] select group that was there to receive
[30:23] it
[30:23] all right showing that that was not the
[30:26] total fulfillment of joy that it would
[30:32] be poured on all flesh but it would come
[30:34] to the life that because there you only
[30:36] have true genuine seed in the Upper Room
[30:43] right a hundred and twenty crew genuine
[30:47] seed all right now exclude Judas and
[30:50] send him out of it before it's over with
[30:52] that he was dire you know all right
[30:56] but then see in the last days he would
[30:58] pour it out on the other time pour out
[31:03] upon all things now forgive me to try to
[31:07] be so carnal but I pick up wrong
[31:11] thoughts maybe they're mine
[31:14] but like I said on the zoo the street it
[31:17] wasn't poured out on everybody in the
[31:18] world
[31:20] it wasn't poured out on the day of
[31:22] Pentecost on everybody in the world so
[31:25] saddle the point in your mind what it's
[31:27] saying he poured out on all flesh if
[31:31] poured out to her that any point Jew
[31:34] Gentile Samaritan water that was not so
[31:38] an original on the dead pinnacle on the
[31:40] day of Pentecost that was only the Jews
[31:42] right
[31:45] and even your first church age was
[31:47] basically all Jews just a few Gentiles
[31:51] sprinkled in here and yonder the Prophet
[31:53] said all right let's see then in this -
[31:55] spliced days on the zoo the street of
[31:58] 1906 the Holy Ghost fell and it would it
[32:03] fell then to where that it would go on
[32:06] to any nation or any part but it's not
[32:10] going to fall on something that's not
[32:12] religious we'll get to that as we go
[32:15] along your anointing that one anoint
[32:18] your spirit will make you religious not
[32:24] but I hope I get to the end of the
[32:25] message where I wrote the notes like
[32:27] this there's a vast difference between
[32:29] Christianity and religion but then
[32:33] religion can be anointed right okay come
[32:41] on now let's get the point in this let's
[32:42] go down all right reason I want you to
[32:44] read the Norn he wants the endtime
[32:46] because I like the way he explains it
[32:49] okay so let's go ahead with number three
[33:02] paragraph 25 okay let's see now watch
[33:08] what he's getting at there shall arise
[33:11] false prophets anointed ones with a
[33:13] message the only way the message can be
[33:16] brought out is by one that's anointed
[33:18] and that would be a prophet anointed
[33:21] there shall rise false anointed teachers
[33:25] now watch him if you take literally word
[33:29] for word what he's saying if it only be
[33:31] poured out on the Prophet so don't get
[33:34] hooked in on that you say brother Dale
[33:35] you just make things so dry and carnal
[33:38] do we get dead listening to you well
[33:40] there's one thing about it you don't
[33:41] have to have no misunderstanding this
[33:45] ain't dealing with just one prophet
[33:48] right come on because there's plenty of
[33:53] false prophets huh now watch and the
[33:57] only way the message could be brought
[33:59] out is by one that's anointed and that
[34:01] would be a prophet and on it
[34:02] there's arrives false anointed teachers
[34:05] a prophet teaches what his message is
[34:11] anointed teachers but anointed people
[34:16] with false teaching anointed people with
[34:23] false teaching Nordic ones Christ plural
[34:26] prophets plural if there's such a thing
[34:29] as a Christ thing later then there would
[34:31] have to be a anointed ones that their
[34:34] prophecy or what they were teaching
[34:36] would be different be the difference
[34:39] because there are no indeed ones all
[34:41] right then he said this is a Sunday
[34:43] School lesson so let's get down he said
[34:46] in the scriptures not by what someone
[34:50] else have said about it but just reading
[34:52] the scripture you say how can this be
[34:58] how can it be that there can be false
[35:04] christs that can have the actual genuine
[35:09] Holy Spirit anointing their spirit and
[35:13] teaching false doctrine come on one of
[35:21] these days we're going to find out why
[35:22] the Prophet had to come bring us the
[35:24] word now he didn't come to bring us the
[35:27] anointing he didn't come to bring us
[35:29] those thing he come to bring us the word
[35:31] God will anoint the word because I like
[35:36] we said one time he said you don't have
[35:38] to pray for God to northwards that hid
[35:39] words already anointed all right so I
[35:42] like that okay
[35:43] now listen you say how can this be would
[35:49] the anointing want
[35:50] what were they Christ CHR is TS anointed
[35:54] Christ's and false prophets anointed
[35:56] ones but false prophets Jesus said that
[36:00] the rain falls on the just and the
[36:03] unjust okay nice putting it in the
[36:05] scripture now someone might say to me do
[36:10] you believe that that anointing on those
[36:12] people means that it's anointing of the
[36:13] Holy Spirit yes sir the genuine Holy
[36:21] Spirit of God upon a person and yet
[36:25] they're false
[36:28] what's he meaning they're false they're
[36:34] not born again is that simple
[36:38] terminology they're not born again all
[36:43] right so no matter what the anointing is
[36:46] that's why I've always tried to do a fan
[36:49] I set up in the other day I found out
[36:53] that they're teaching now that the
[36:56] twelve had the Holy Ghost before
[36:57] Pentecost
[36:59] but they had it back before Jesus was
[37:02] crucified I said my lord people we we
[37:07] understood the bat in the Baptist Church
[37:08] we taught that you couldn't get born
[37:10] again until after the Holy Ghost fell
[37:12] cuz the Bible said it but see that's how
[37:16] far people can go off and claim this
[37:19] mass limit with their own concept or
[37:23] thought see of the anointing they're
[37:28] false
[37:29] they're not falsely anointed the
[37:36] yesterday or a time being falsely
[37:37] anointed would be something with half
[37:39] now the anointing is genuine but their
[37:45] teaching is what's false all right well
[37:51] how much closer does it get with Balaam
[37:53] that his teaching was not false of what
[37:57] he said about Jesus Christ
[37:59] what about Caiphas that his teaching was
[38:02] not false when he prophesied that one
[38:05] must die for the sins of the people
[38:09] yet it was an anointed one they were
[38:12] nothing wrong with the anointing brother
[38:15] Branham said Balaam could not say you
[38:18] remember he told him he told by that he
[38:20] said I'll go away he said but I can't
[38:22] say nothing only what that angel or what
[38:25] God tells me and he regard listen what
[38:28] he was offering he said I'll give you so
[38:31] much in the king he said you can give me
[38:33] the whole thing he said I can't say
[38:37] nothing that God don't tell me and he
[38:40] didn't but he tricked the people into
[38:43] going wrong after the Murat by women and
[38:46] the things that was in the land but as
[38:49] far as his message that he brought he
[38:51] was lined up good
[38:55] but did anyone after the wrong time
[38:57] money is sometimes right listen and
[38:59] listen close and see what it's in and
[39:01] they shall show signs and wonders and so
[39:03] much that it would deceive the very
[39:04] elect if it were possible and they are
[39:07] anointed with a genuine holy spirit I
[39:09] know this sounds very foolish but we're
[39:12] going to take time and examine it by the
[39:15] word that that's absolutely thus saith
[39:18] the Lord the truth what about it the
[39:27] anointing is not false
[39:33] it's the anointing it's the Holy Spirit
[39:37] and it's on the people
[39:43] my fault it's not thoughts anointed ones
[39:46] its anointed ones that they themselves
[39:50] are false because of their teaching had
[39:57] Balaam stayed with God he stayed there
[40:01] was that's what's always caught me I
[40:03] like things something bangs you read Ron
[40:06] said one day he said to be a prophet in
[40:07] Israel meant something Wow Balaam is a
[40:13] false prophet but it meant something you
[40:15] know what everybody running to him
[40:17] wanting him to what would happen if
[40:22] brother Branham would went after the
[40:23] wrong time you know the gift would have
[40:25] still been working her you remember how
[40:29] that they tried to get him to find out
[40:30] all well and he knew exactly where it
[40:33] was at but he knew they was going to use
[40:39] the money wrong and they had done told
[40:40] him they would put the money in the work
[40:42] of God he would have been a
[40:45] multi-billionaire and he turned every
[40:50] bit of a dime that gift and that prophet
[40:56] would work
[41:00] that's why it was being so dangerous you
[41:02] think it couldn't the bra what if
[41:04] brother branham would went to Israel he
[41:09] said God told him said don't go I said
[41:12] to you NIC with the a Manoj does not
[41:14] fool yet so don't go he said I said I do
[41:17] believe that I'll have something to do
[41:19] remember with Israel getting the message
[41:21] and I believe it too
[41:23] they're gonna get this message they're
[41:25] going to get it through to prophets but
[41:27] it'll be thus saith the Lord right
[41:29] straight through from this message to
[41:31] show them the truth of it all I believe
[41:32] that but what if he the wind what if he
[41:37] that got up and said if I'm right let
[41:41] God come and vindicate it you say what
[41:43] have God done it yes
[41:46] he killed 40-something children because
[41:51] the Prophet said first brother run said
[41:57] now that was not God he knew how to
[42:00] handle it but he said it was the power
[42:02] of the Prophet the one of these days
[42:07] I'll preach on what anointing really is
[42:09] because brother branham tells us
[42:11] anointing is not speaking in tongues
[42:13] shout and crying this and then give
[42:14] signs of one but the Prophet said
[42:17] anointing was supreme power in control
[42:23] now that's the anointing supreme power
[42:26] in control see that's why if you know
[42:31] the truth and you got it right you ain't
[42:32] afraid of nothing you think I'm afraid
[42:35] to go on the internet around the world
[42:37] preach what I preach the way that I
[42:39] preached home
[42:41] Cosi I've always got one time if you
[42:45] correct what I preach I can gain from
[42:48] that but if it turns out it don't maybe
[42:52] you get corrected so okay I don't work
[42:56] but listen now all right now you said
[43:00] you mean to tell me that that is the
[43:05] genuine Holy Spirit see we've talked and
[43:10] basically most of people the message
[43:11] still teach it that way that if you was
[43:13] in any way connected with God you got
[43:16] eternal life you're okay
[43:20] and if you got gifts working in UI you
[43:23] really okay and it's not much different
[43:28] than what I remember brother mo telling
[43:30] about that guy that had run off with a
[43:31] piano player and this lady called him up
[43:35] and were talking to him on the phone and
[43:36] and she come back and told him said he
[43:39] still had the Holy Ghost said cuz he was
[43:41] speaking in tongues right while he was
[43:42] talking to me
[43:44] that's something they didn't matter if
[43:48] he'd run off with a piano player she
[43:50] thought he was still right but you see
[43:56] Church why it would be so close it would
[44:00] deceive the very elect if it was
[44:03] possible all right
[44:06] well frankly the Prophet said he'd get
[44:08] them tied up then he'd have to cut the
[44:12] work short like I said I hope I won't
[44:14] repeat it again because that one is hard
[44:16] to follow
[44:18] come on listen to what I'm saying about
[44:21] it that anointing is so wonderful you
[44:28] realize that this the Prophet said the
[44:30] same Holy Ghost that was on Moses was on
[44:35] Balaam the same Holy Ghost that was on
[44:42] Caiaphas is the one that was on the Lord
[44:46] Jesus Christ but you know what I love
[44:49] about it
[44:50] the same Holy Ghost that was dwelling
[44:52] inside of the Lord Jesus Christ by your
[44:56] new birth that Holy Spirit is dwelling
[44:58] in you not as an anointing remember I've
[45:05] made this statement Ubar well that you
[45:08] write it down anointed ones are not
[45:12] sealed in because it's in your spirit
[45:17] and you're not sealed in your spirit
[45:22] you're sealed in your soul
[45:26] so anointed ones you see real quick I'll
[45:32] just ask you the question because this
[45:33] is what is with me what's the difference
[45:36] in a person who really genuinely has a
[45:39] brother branham okay what's the
[45:41] difference in brother Branham now take
[45:44] sot him being a prophet and etc but i'm
[45:46] using that as an illustration what's the
[45:48] difference in answering someone believer
[45:50] that you could think of they're both
[45:54] anointed but you realize that old Joe
[45:59] Blow or of who you'd call the other one
[46:01] Samuel Dale or anything you want to do
[46:03] it you know that anointing if I'm I
[46:06] don't matter of fact inside of me as
[46:08] false as can be
[46:10] this spirit with inside of me can be
[46:13] anointed by the Holy Spirit
[46:16] and do great signs and wonders and me be
[46:20] lost and die and go to hell just get
[46:25] your morning is the ride of what you're
[46:26] doing and when you're reading the book
[46:28] you'll see what he's talking about or
[46:29] listen to this day there's no difference
[46:32] in that anointing it doesn't matter
[46:37] whether you're a Christian or not the
[46:39] anointing is where you're anointed
[46:44] you're not sealed in that anointing
[46:48] you're sealed by the baptism of the Holy
[46:51] Spirit in your soul that displays back
[46:58] out through your spirit and into your
[47:00] body
[47:07] what about it do we realize that
[47:12] but you realize that's - like he's
[47:15] saying you mean to tell me that you
[47:17] believe that is a genuine anointing come
[47:26] on you say how can this be would you
[47:31] know at once what were they
[47:33] Christ chri ASDs anointed christ and
[47:38] false prophets anointed once with false
[47:41] prophets jesus said that the rain would
[47:44] fall on the just and the unjust someone
[47:47] might say to me do you mean do you
[47:49] believe that that anointing on those
[47:51] people means that it's the anointing of
[47:54] the Holy Spirit yes sir the genuine Holy
[47:58] Spirit of God upon a person but yet they
[48:01] are false he said what he's saying we've
[48:10] got one another one in here we gots a
[48:11] whole lot more robe right where he says
[48:13] they're lost yes but you can't tell me
[48:19] brother Dale I'm lost I better have
[48:21] anointed I feel it that's why brother
[48:24] Brown said you can't tell that woman was
[48:25] cutting grass I heard with her short
[48:26] song it was wrong for her to do it I
[48:28] know that not I'll get to that one he
[48:32] said you can't tell her that why because
[48:34] she's anointed being anointed with the
[48:39] Spirit of God doesn't mean you're saved
[48:41] I'm trying to get that to all of us
[48:47] well you're taking away everything now
[48:50] if I'm taking away anything it's not
[48:52] genuine false word can't even take away
[48:57] truth right don't worry about it uh-huh
[49:05] go ahead to number five let's read
[49:12] number four word let's get to Helen
[49:13] let's get Deuteronomy they had the other
[49:15] day okay all right now rise willing you
[49:18] a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and
[49:20] give it the assignor a wonder and the
[49:22] sign or the wonder come to pice or for
[49:25] he spake unto thee saying let us go
[49:27] after other gods which thou has not
[49:29] known and let us serve them thou shalt
[49:32] not hearken unto the words of that
[49:35] prophet or that dreamer of dreams for
[49:39] the Lord your God prove with you to know
[49:42] whether you love the Lord your God with
[49:44] all your heart and with all your soul my
[49:48] brother Dale how can we know
[49:55] how can we know whether we're right or
[49:57] not
[50:02] what's the evidence of the holy ghost
[50:10] it's where the spirit and you agrees
[50:13] with the word or not now remember that's
[50:14] not talking about anointing though come
[50:17] on it's whether or not that that's
[50:21] living within you as the Jesus Christ in
[50:23] your soul sealed in by the by the
[50:26] anointing of the Holy Ghost and made
[50:28] alive the word that's within there and
[50:30] you turned around and you won't be
[50:33] deceived do you understand what I'm
[50:40] trying to say I said this 40 years ago I
[50:43] said one day and I was using this verse
[50:45] scripture I said what would happen if
[50:47] you rolled three caskets in here and a
[50:49] guy get up there and say you know that
[50:51] everybody don't believe in my doctor and
[50:53] or two souls to Lourdes and whatever
[50:55] this or that or the other kind of
[50:57] messages but said God's gonna raise
[50:59] these from the dead said you come down
[51:02] and raise them and what if they're
[51:10] raised from the dead
[51:15] God says he's doing it to try it
[51:24] come on what I mean if you're gonna do
[51:27] anything in this message why not get
[51:28] down the end of the message that's what
[51:31] gets me if you're they come up with some
[51:34] idea because of something day that's
[51:35] under something this side of that they
[51:37] don't get into the meat of the message
[51:43] because we're not to sold doctrine came
[51:45] out years ago you know what it sent me
[51:47] on the study of the soul the to sold
[51:54] doctrine set me anchored into one thing
[51:58] to learn what the Prophet said about the
[52:01] soul what the Bible said about it
[52:03] because it was very very deceiving but
[52:07] not enough to deceive anybody hardly
[52:11] but yet it did where are you at
[52:17] that's not hearken under the words of
[52:19] that prophet or that dreamer of dreams
[52:23] let's see wedges before we get to
[52:26] where's another one I want one hold on a
[52:33] minute
[52:34] yeah if you'll drop back to number three
[52:38] when brother branham is on the anointed
[52:40] ones in town easy listen close and see
[52:42] what he said and they shall show signs
[52:44] and wonders and so much that it would
[52:47] deceive the very elect if it were
[52:48] possible and they are anointed with the
[52:51] genuine holy spirit I know that sounds
[52:54] very foolish but we're going to take
[52:58] time and explain it by the word that's
[53:02] that's absolutely thus saith the Lord
[53:09] yeah
[53:11] that should be enough for any of us but
[53:15] listen going back over to number five
[53:20] let's become that we was in number four
[53:25] these are all from anointed once the end
[53:27] time today on the message the same Holy
[53:29] Spirit does annoyance the church that
[53:31] gives them a desire to save souls that
[53:33] gives them power to perform miracles it
[53:35] falls on the unjust the same as the just
[53:38] and the very same spirit now you can't
[53:42] make it another way and understand
[53:44] Matthew 24:24
[53:46] he said there shall arise false Christ's
[53:49] false anointed ones anointed with the
[53:53] genuine thing but be false prophets of
[53:57] it false teachers of it
[54:01] see false teachers anointed anointed
[54:04] christ but false teachers is selling the
[54:07] way you can see it
[54:09] hmm let's get number six and then we'll
[54:13] see because this would be where we'll
[54:16] get to and stop now teaching of Balaam
[54:20] not the prophecy of Balaam that's it
[54:25] that was all right
[54:27] the what the prophecy of Balaam not the
[54:29] teaching of Balaam wooden rod is true
[54:31] prophecy of Balaam because that was what
[54:33] God said that was all right that was God
[54:36] having to believe that congregation says
[54:37] amen the prophecy of Balaam was exactly
[54:40] right because he couldn't speak nothing
[54:43] else the anointing of God wouldn't speak
[54:47] nothing else
[54:50] I don't understand when people say God
[54:56] told me
[54:57] God can't told you and me anything that
[55:00] ain't in his word that might not be good
[55:03] language but it's plain since he can't
[55:06] teach you something that's not in his
[55:08] word so I'm gonna stay with a word I'll
[55:13] do the best I can see Balaam was exactly
[55:17] right
[55:18] because you couldn't speak nothing else
[55:19] the anointing of God wouldn't speak
[55:21] nothing else and God vindicated by
[55:23] proving it was the truth but it was the
[55:26] teaching of Balaam now compare that with
[55:29] Mathew 24:24 anointed ones their
[55:32] teaching is false the Trinities and all
[55:38] these things like that
[55:39] wrong now I'm saying they should have
[55:43] put wrong and in space Antichrist cuz
[55:46] that's what it is wrong not wrong at
[55:47] across wrong it was the Antichrist it's
[55:52] the end of Christ now that's taking the
[55:53] people away from the real truth what
[55:57] else is doing it then cinnamoned the
[56:01] Trinity's in thing say the things that
[56:03] they're doing today well brother Branham
[56:04] doctor and Colorado and and he being
[56:09] brother ought to talk about this Sunday
[56:11] this was a was in the seventies
[56:15] we had ministers means on in seventies
[56:19] about 71 somewhere right in there about
[56:22] that cloud out there in Colorado
[56:24] I mean Arizona and I told them then I
[56:28] said what if you gonna find that one
[56:30] these day they change the dates on the
[56:31] hunting rights and and allowed in the
[56:33] hut that week all it is is a discrepancy
[56:36] between what's in the magazine lie and
[56:43] brother branham and his statements and
[56:45] then something spoke to me the other day
[56:46] time waiting on it to see I believe it
[56:49] did said they're dealing with the wrong
[56:51] date now we'll see one of these days
[56:56] whether that'll come out right or not
[56:57] but that was the statement that was made
[56:59] said they're dealing with the wrong day
[57:01] what do I care that's what I told
[57:03] brother oil tick what I told you over
[57:05] and over and over I don't care what they
[57:08] prove I don't care what they say about
[57:10] brother Brennan and the message and the
[57:12] things like here he led me to the Lord
[57:15] Jesus Christ and that's where I'll stay
[57:18] I don't care what you say he'd done or
[57:22] didn't do or did do over there whatever
[57:24] you're just trying to find some little
[57:26] something no a prophet stands before no
[57:30] man
[57:34] what if brother Branham gave the wrong
[57:36] dates out there as a human being to
[57:39] where it would be confusing to you and
[57:44] me I said if a human being he couldn't
[57:48] lie about it but he could make a
[57:51] statement of the wrong date on the human
[57:53] beings I remember from his beginning up
[58:02] till ninth inning in really 64 coming
[58:08] into the seals heard of random talk the
[58:11] white horse rider was the Holy Ghost the
[58:18] seals had to break to show him the truth
[58:22] of that now what are you gonna do
[58:28] you know what he would do go back and
[58:30] listen he would teach that to white
[58:34] horse rights even in your church age
[58:35] bukas he would stand up there and say if
[58:39] I've told you the truth
[58:41] let God come and vindicate it and God
[58:45] raised the dead and healed the sick and
[58:48] done all kind of miracles and wonders
[58:50] let me state it at what people are
[58:53] saying about with false word
[58:55] it wasn't false word that had never
[58:58] shined on that I don't care of course
[59:01] Larkin talked before brother Branham
[59:04] ever come that the white horse rider was
[59:05] a the Antichrist that don't make no
[59:08] difference he was not the messenger he
[59:13] said you say what I say he said because
[59:15] I will be responsible and up until 64
[59:20] right in there he was teaching that but
[59:26] light remember whipped off the top
[59:28] he said light never shined down in here
[59:33] there was nobody could correct him do
[59:37] you understand what he said when he made
[59:38] the statement he said no prophet a man
[59:42] don't stand between God and a prophet
[59:44] there's no way for a human mortal to
[59:48] correct a prophet of God come on it
[59:51] ain't even sensible because even Balaam
[59:53] couldn't tell it wrong you say yeah but
[59:57] brother Branham was wrong all them years
[59:59] oh let's take some more from fifties up
[1:00:02] to 63 64 he told body so spirit as the
[1:00:10] three rims right but then when the seals
[1:00:16] broke he taught body spirit soul excuse
[1:00:20] me are going to inward body outside
[1:00:22] spirit second trim shoulders the sinner
[1:00:25] you realize until he taught that you can
[1:00:29] teach false doctrine with him if all I
[1:00:33] had was from 62 back I could read you
[1:00:36] that brother Branham said this you say
[1:00:41] yeah but wait a minute
[1:00:42] yeah if he said something else like I'd
[1:00:45] take that now it was there's that thing
[1:00:49] he sent it to tries to tries to see what
[1:00:53] we do what are we going to do with it
[1:00:56] all right
[1:01:01] let me read this because this is the
[1:01:02] point I won't compare that with Matthew
[1:01:05] 24 all right let's see
[1:01:09] raise it up let's get it right here I
[1:01:12] hope your feelings don't get hurt now I
[1:01:16] hope I would love to be able to preach
[1:01:21] I've told you this over and over how
[1:01:23] many wants to answer that part of them
[1:01:25] fixing the Sun I've told you I wish I
[1:01:27] could preach that everybody in this
[1:01:29] building would find out whether they're
[1:01:32] born again or not cuz if you're not born
[1:01:37] again you can do something about it if
[1:01:41] you are born again you're gonna shout
[1:01:43] glory hallelujah about the truth let's
[1:01:49] see we don't want to quote brother
[1:01:50] Branham we want our own little idea of
[1:01:54] something but look what he says I hope
[1:01:57] your feelings don't get hurt and don't
[1:01:59] turn that them phones off and don't get
[1:02:01] up and go out you're set still and let's
[1:02:04] see if the Holy Spirit won't reveal it
[1:02:05] to it and prove to us you say but that
[1:02:11] just whatever you believe just sit still
[1:02:15] and listen it ain't just whatever you
[1:02:18] believe and ask God to open your heart
[1:02:23] then you'll find out whether you're a
[1:02:26] briar or a thistle or whatever your were
[1:02:30] ever your standing pray for him to open
[1:02:35] your heart yes but I take doubt that he
[1:02:37] saved me I'm not asking you to doubt he
[1:02:40] saved you I'm asking you for one time in
[1:02:43] your life to have concern about your own
[1:02:45] soul not watch somebody else teaching
[1:02:48] but whether or not you're born again in
[1:02:50] that soul because remember anointing
[1:02:53] one's caitli sealed in they're actually
[1:02:56] filled out
[1:02:59] by the same anointing that you're sealed
[1:03:02] in sealed them out we could find out
[1:03:11] whether or not we're Christians or not
[1:03:14] if we understand what brethren is
[1:03:16] teaching on anointed ones now here's the
[1:03:22] thought that came to me there's a vast
[1:03:23] difference you remember how he was
[1:03:27] bringing out Balaam had so many
[1:03:28] followers this had so many followers and
[1:03:30] that has so many followers there's a
[1:03:35] vast difference between a Christian and
[1:03:37] a religious person a religious person
[1:03:45] can be anointed with the genuine Holy
[1:03:49] Spirit on their spirit and still be lost
[1:03:54] but a real true Christian he has the
[1:03:59] anointing on his Spirit also we'll get
[1:04:02] to that that's the that's the joy of it
[1:04:04] a true born-again Christian has the
[1:04:06] anointing upon your spirit but he
[1:04:08] quickens the word is in your soul the
[1:04:14] anointing ones don't have the word
[1:04:16] within them that's why they're false
[1:04:21] they can't have it within them they turn
[1:04:23] it down with true genuine that has the
[1:04:26] word within them those disciples had
[1:04:29] that word in them waiting and the Holy
[1:04:31] Ghost fell and quickened the word that
[1:04:33] they had heard
[1:04:37] darzee new birth is the word not an
[1:04:41] anointing not how much you shouted or
[1:04:44] cried or spoke in tongues what I've told
[1:04:48] in my life and most preachers could tell
[1:04:50] it they would try to get the biggest
[1:04:52] following I've seen God when I was 11
[1:04:56] years old I've seen an angel three times
[1:05:00] in my home I have no problem with
[1:05:06] anybody but none of that is the new
[1:05:08] birth yeah but you saw God know it's
[1:05:14] whether or not God can come in you and
[1:05:17] that was my trouble back there
[1:05:19] I'd go out you've heard me tell it
[1:05:22] you're at least listen to what I say and
[1:05:23] said I'm not lying cause we're not
[1:05:25] trying to make nothing that go out and
[1:05:27] seeing the sins of the world come home
[1:05:29] and feel sorry and just set them so why
[1:05:33] did I do that you know just what I do
[1:05:39] I just felt condemned I never counted
[1:05:48] none of those things as the new birth I
[1:05:52] never came into this message glory
[1:05:55] hallelujah look what I saw before I
[1:05:57] heard the prophet
[1:06:05] but you see God is real that's what he
[1:06:09] wanted me to know he's real you heard me
[1:06:15] tell her than three times especially the
[1:06:16] first time when I grabbed my pistol and
[1:06:18] took off Astrid
[1:06:19] that's how real I'm not no fly-by-night
[1:06:23] and crazy nut I don't think so but when
[1:06:27] I looked up and saw something standing
[1:06:29] in the bedroom door looking at me
[1:06:30] the first thing I went for was a 357
[1:06:33] hanging on my poster bed I went after it
[1:06:36] Peggy went off the bed on the other side
[1:06:38] and the boys were straight across she
[1:06:40] said what do you do it I said get in
[1:06:41] that room with them why I said there's
[1:06:45] somebody in this house you get in there
[1:06:49] with them I searched that house over I
[1:06:53] couldn't find nobody next time it was a
[1:06:58] little different a little more relaxed
[1:07:02] the third time when I turned over look I
[1:07:05] said well you're still dying what you
[1:07:10] see I'm not trying to teach you you got
[1:07:14] to have this that or the other to be a
[1:07:16] Christian you don't have to see angels
[1:07:19] you don't have to do those things it's
[1:07:20] kind of like the scripture says but the
[1:07:22] old men are dream dream of young men
[1:07:23] will see visions well it's the old men
[1:07:25] dream dreams brother right how old are
[1:07:27] you you dream a lot see old men dream
[1:07:31] dreams and that's not throwing Scripture
[1:07:37] that's just showing you how crazy where
[1:07:39] all our inner thoughts young me in a
[1:07:43] dream dream some of these young boys
[1:07:44] have dreams sometimes so good you see
[1:07:49] church
[1:07:52] there's a vast difference between a
[1:07:54] religious person a religious person can
[1:07:59] be anointed with the Holy Spirit cast
[1:08:01] out devils pray for the sick do all kind
[1:08:06] of things and yet turned down the word
[1:08:10] and prove that you're lost there's where
[1:08:13] the proof comes with us turning down the
[1:08:15] word what about it cause a religious
[1:08:24] person is like a church formed like
[1:08:26] brother old he was talking about you had
[1:08:29] Buddha and him coming up now let me ask
[1:08:31] you a question
[1:08:31] seriously everybody just just listen to
[1:08:34] me seriously for a second what's the
[1:08:37] difference between Buddha and the
[1:08:43] doctrine
[1:08:47] and Christianity
[1:08:54] remember what the man said to brother
[1:08:56] branham Buddha told us about a place to
[1:09:02] go
[1:09:03] Buddha told us we had this waiting on us
[1:09:06] when we died right Buddha the the Quran
[1:09:14] and the things if you read the Quran
[1:09:16] what little bit I read of it talked
[1:09:17] sister barber about it and so brother
[1:09:20] all in India oh brother Prakash if you
[1:09:27] took the Quran and live box you'd live a
[1:09:29] good life
[1:09:31] you got to fast so many days you got to
[1:09:34] do this you got to do that if you took
[1:09:36] the Buddha doctrine and live bite you'd
[1:09:39] live a good life oh you're crazy I never
[1:09:45] heard nobody talk like it what what is
[1:09:46] it you're promised a no lending was
[1:09:54] promised a happy hunting ground
[1:10:00] but see there was a lot of difference
[1:10:03] because they saved you run them oh that
[1:10:08] Geronimo talk to a supernatural part and
[1:10:15] that's the reason they could never catch
[1:10:17] him he told him one day he said Geronimo
[1:10:20] made their statement that whatever that
[1:10:23] was told him says they can never shoot
[1:10:26] you and said I will guide your arrows
[1:10:32] one day the Sun was rising and they were
[1:10:36] being cut off the military and Geronimo
[1:10:39] said that every what it was told him
[1:10:42] said it'll go and it just went dark
[1:10:44] cloudy and they all wrote off and they
[1:10:47] never caught a one those people had a
[1:10:50] connection with the supernatural yet we
[1:10:55] think about it see you know what would
[1:10:57] be you answer to most people my Jesus
[1:11:00] lives that's like they told us I cared
[1:11:02] what was it in the 60s when they were
[1:11:05] saying God was dead All Hallows read
[1:11:07] what his name would what was that guy's
[1:11:08] name said that God was dead and
[1:11:10] everybody run after and oh they went on
[1:11:13] I know my God Leo's could I talked to
[1:11:16] him this morning
[1:11:20] butit eight times on what do you put
[1:11:25] your religion on Buddha would live would
[1:11:29] put living a good life what do we put
[1:11:36] go down to some of these lodges and get
[1:11:38] your star case lecture and look at the
[1:11:40] Statue of a perfect man draw it out on
[1:11:42] the floor in a lodge you see what I'm
[1:11:51] talking about
[1:11:54] what's the difference between a
[1:11:56] Christian and a religious person a
[1:11:59] religious person goes to church pays
[1:12:01] ties leaves God leaves godly you know
[1:12:03] and does good what do you do you go to
[1:12:12] church you pay you tidy little Colleen
[1:12:17] and brother down I'm anointed I've seen
[1:12:23] visions out that dreamed I've done I put
[1:12:30] myself right in the middle of that when
[1:12:31] I just said it I've seen angels that's
[1:12:33] not that's no proof that you're born
[1:12:36] again no proof whatsoever you say but
[1:12:45] what's the proof that I'm a Christian
[1:12:50] that's whether or not that one that's
[1:12:54] within you agrees which agrees is a
[1:12:59] pearl oral statement which means it will
[1:13:02] it will continue because if it ever
[1:13:05] stops it's not in the continuing I told
[1:13:07] the Baptist that because the Bible said
[1:13:09] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[1:13:12] be saved I said how come it says believe
[1:13:14] it when you told us we've got everything
[1:13:17] when we believed
[1:13:21] that's when I was walking out the door
[1:13:23] the Baptist Church and that brother he
[1:13:25] said I know you're right said that's
[1:13:27] what we talked I said what you gonna do
[1:13:30] about it
[1:13:31] nothing
[1:13:38] you see Church one of these days you'll
[1:13:40] find out that what do you walk away from
[1:13:44] the place that others went to that was
[1:13:47] dead ain't talking about buildings and
[1:13:50] Lula and this one and that one
[1:13:54] I'm talking about the Word of God
[1:14:06] but look at him today how much they're
[1:14:07] splitting all across the land
[1:14:09] I don't blame them
[1:14:16] I don't blame people for leaving if my
[1:14:20] soul is involved in what I believe
[1:14:29] I love my family when Terrance was
[1:14:32] talking about it today ain't it odd that
[1:14:34] you you have you look at okay the family
[1:14:39] at Lula is based around and highs around
[1:14:42] in dealing with the Dale family because
[1:14:46] it's everybody's into jobs well not all
[1:14:49] of these other people why can't they get
[1:14:50] their people kids to come to church well
[1:14:58] why is yours here because I claimed him
[1:15:00] believed it come and I've tried my best
[1:15:03] to offer him a salvation that is simple
[1:15:06] enough to be able to understand of
[1:15:09] salvation to be able to believe that if
[1:15:11] that new birth comes into you heart that
[1:15:13] new birth that came on the day of
[1:15:15] Pentecost didn't just stop in the spirit
[1:15:17] of those people to 120 to start with and
[1:15:22] in the three thousand later it didn't
[1:15:23] stop in their spirit that spirit that
[1:15:26] I'll get to it later when we're talking
[1:15:27] about the the spirit realm it came down
[1:15:30] through their spirit yes but it
[1:15:33] quickened what was in their soul which
[1:15:35] was the word they had heard the Bible
[1:15:38] said they took the word and held it and
[1:15:40] the Holy Ghost fell on that word and
[1:15:43] made that word alive
[1:15:46] what's the difference in a Christian and
[1:15:50] a religious person a religious person
[1:15:52] can be highly anointed but they can't
[1:15:54] have the word alive they will turn it
[1:15:59] down somewhere but brother Dale if I got
[1:16:04] the anointing in my spirit it teach me
[1:16:09] I thought that the teacher that's within
[1:16:18] us is not a spirit realm like that of
[1:16:22] dis teaching us this editor I thought it
[1:16:25] was an inside teacher that was in the
[1:16:28] soul si we're gonna find out one of
[1:16:33] these days why brother Dale fifty years
[1:16:35] has been hollering about a soul trying
[1:16:36] my best to get to Lulu church on the one
[1:16:38] thing that soul is the real you
[1:16:42] I don't care where you're anointed at
[1:16:45] and what you've done in what you've seen
[1:16:46] maybe that's why God allowed me to come
[1:16:49] through where I'm at if I'm lost thank
[1:16:51] God I'll still preach it right up to the
[1:16:52] day I die
[1:16:53] this message is the truth then I don't
[1:16:57] care what you say brother branham done
[1:17:01] just give it a little time it'll all be
[1:17:05] put together but until that time comes
[1:17:08] I'm going to stay with what I believe
[1:17:09] about it that this word is the alive
[1:17:13] word see the anointing to a born-again
[1:17:17] Christian doesn't stop in your spirit it
[1:17:21] goes and it quickens that word that's
[1:17:23] within your soul the being if you are
[1:17:28] and it made that 120 little Jesus's 3000
[1:17:35] heard one message and got the same Holy
[1:17:38] Ghost that the others God but not just
[1:17:41] an anointing in the way you know the
[1:17:46] reason I love it because see all of them
[1:17:48] always would say this is that come on
[1:17:54] music Peter rose up and said this is
[1:17:59] that this is what all the Old Testament
[1:18:03] had to say about it
[1:18:06] listen to what the prophets said on the
[1:18:08] message God provided way of healing now
[1:18:14] they don't have this one sort of there's
[1:18:18] a vast difference in looking at God's
[1:18:22] Word and receiving God's Word I'm
[1:18:31] reading what he says there's a vast
[1:18:33] difference in looking at God's Word and
[1:18:35] receiving God's Word when you then that
[1:18:39] received the word that was not them that
[1:18:44] examined it
[1:18:47] but them that received it then that
[1:18:53] received were not then to the examiner
[1:18:54] but them that received it god added to
[1:18:57] the church such as be saved three
[1:19:00] thousand souls receive the word you can
[1:19:03] hear the word preached you can look at
[1:19:06] it and admit that it's right Cain did
[1:19:09] all the others did but just where the
[1:19:13] word fell brought forth then that
[1:19:16] received it gladly was baptized see
[1:19:18] receiving the word what is it what is
[1:19:23] your new birth I shouted I cried I've
[1:19:27] spoken done welcome brother Dale now
[1:19:29] I've above that now I used to believe
[1:19:31] that but now I don't believe that now
[1:19:33] well I believe this because I've done
[1:19:35] this or I've done that I'm saved well
[1:19:38] you just move it one thing to another
[1:19:42] right you just move it from one place to
[1:19:44] another yeah if that word is not made
[1:19:52] alive now listen and we'll get back to
[1:19:57] this if it drops into your spirit and
[1:20:00] stops it will not be alive in your soul
[1:20:06] if it comes into that spirit and dwells
[1:20:09] on long enough to quicken that that's in
[1:20:12] your soul then you're a child of God is
[1:20:16] that it that's simple enough not if it
[1:20:19] stops on your spirit don't make you a
[1:20:21] Christian cause it stops on your spirit
[1:20:24] mm-hmm makes you a Christian when the
[1:20:28] same word that remember what brother
[1:20:30] altered was talking about the same
[1:20:31] children the same children you know God
[1:20:37] has children sons and daughters that
[1:20:40] will stand on the word
[1:20:45] and believe it you can't turn them from
[1:20:49] it
[1:20:53] Mustang
[1:20:55] think on these things what about it
[1:21:00] what is your life dependence upon
[1:21:02] because you're anointed because I feel
[1:21:08] it yeah
[1:21:15] a lot of you've heard my testimony I
[1:21:17] don't I love to tell it but see it's not
[1:21:19] telling it to get any glory out of its
[1:21:21] to telling show what God can do he can
[1:21:28] change us make us his children
[1:21:36] yeah but if I'm predestinated I'll make
[1:21:39] it now you're making it district won't
[1:21:43] that he done something a lot about
[1:21:45] predestination well we got brother 251

[1:27:04] of everything and he was the head Bishop
[1:27:07] of the island of Jamaica I talked with

[1:27:43] Christians about it let's just let
[1:27:45] Christ come into these little children
[1:27:47] and to save their souls
[1:27:49] you know what there was many of them
[1:27:52] that did I believe it

[1:27:58] as sincere as I could about Jesus Christ
[1:28:04] that's my brother branham said what he
[1:28:07] said we're not getting them to Jesus he
[1:28:10] said I'm concerned about that they were
[1:28:13] not getting them to Jesus what the real
[1:28:16] Jesus of the word the real Lord Jesus
[1:28:21] not the Christ that we claim to be but
[1:28:26] you study that anointed one just read
[1:28:29] through the book and go back through it
[1:28:30] look what your prophet taught on
[1:28:32] anointed ones we would not be able to
[1:28:36] understand where we're at if it wasn't
