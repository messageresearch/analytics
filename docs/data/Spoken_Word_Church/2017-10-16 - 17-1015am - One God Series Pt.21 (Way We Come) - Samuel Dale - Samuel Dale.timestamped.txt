[0:17] all of those things about it because
[0:19] anybody's ever had migraine you don't

[0:25] you do everything you can to try to to

[0:29] anything to happen to cause one of them
[0:32] to come on and they need medication you
[0:33] take you don't want to do it that way
[0:35] but just remember that and just pray
[0:37] that the Lord be with it
[0:38] remember the let's see what are we gonna

[1:02] father we thank you for all the things
[1:04] that you've given unto us and all of
[1:06] life and peace and joy and thank you
[1:09] Lord most of all for opening your word
[1:11] on to us because only through that can
[1:14] we comprehend anything about you because
[1:19] if you had not have come that away to
[1:20] reveal yourself where would we be and
[1:23] father we have enough trouble as it is
[1:25] when life - to try to exist in things
[1:28] but yet the devil would fight everything
[1:30] he could to cut off that word being
[1:33] brought unto us that we could be able to
[1:36] fellowship in you and we pray that you
[1:38] just bless our wife Lord take away that
[1:40] sickness from her and let your loving
[1:42] grace be with her they were the ones
[1:45] traveling back home and all in the the
[1:47] dillion's just have your loving grace we
[1:49] love you and we thank you in Jesus name
[1:54] everybody knows where we've been reading
[1:56] from we reading from John and then we'll
[1:59] go to songs John won this in the
[2:04] beginning was the word and the Word was
[2:07] with God and the Word was God the same
[2:09] was in the beginning with God all things
[2:11] were made by him
[2:13] and without him was not anything made
[2:15] that was made in him was life and the
[2:18] life was the light of men and light
[2:21] shyness and darkness and the darkness
[2:23] comprehended it not let's go over to
[2:26] Psalms 51 because we're gonna try to get
[2:30] into the way that you and I come into
[2:34] being you know and we'll go to the
[2:36] scripture hopefully reaching it today
[2:40] Psalms 51 says have mercy upon me O God
[2:45] according to thy loving-kindness
[2:47] according unto the multitude of thy
[2:50] tender mercies blot out my
[2:52] transgressions wash me thoroughly from
[2:55] my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin
[2:58] for I acknowledge my transgressions and
[3:01] my sin is ever before me against thee
[3:04] thee only have I sinned and done this
[3:07] evil in thy sight that I mightest be
[3:10] justified when thou speakest and be
[3:13] clear when thou judges behold I was
[3:17] shapen in iniquity and in sin did my
[3:20] mother conceive me now you go over like
[3:23] Psalm 58 and you said born in sin you
[3:26] put them all together so you got the
[3:28] thing the Prophet would say you're born
[3:30] in sin shaping an iniquity spouse and
[3:32] mother's wound and go forth a liar you
[3:34] know as you go through you may be seated
[3:36] the Lord at his blessing to the reading
[3:38] of the word we have an announcement I
[3:41] forgot to give to Terrence but it's for
[3:44] the meeting at the Murphysboro Tennessee
[3:54] on November the 3rd 4th and 5th and
[3:56] their announcements is up here the guest
[3:59] speakers be runs brother on Spencer
[4:01] brother Tim Dodd and brother Murphy so
[4:04] you don't pick up this get a copy of it
[4:06] or whatever and just get an opportunity
[4:10] to go and be with them oh man now what
[4:13] are we're trying to do we've got down to
[4:15] a position in our own our understanding
[4:19] of how that things come into being and
[4:23] and what has happened we spent a quite a
[4:26] lot
[4:27] time speaking of these things but yet
[4:31] what what my point has all been is for
[4:36] us to see that how that God condescended
[4:40] down to her he would reveal himself to
[4:44] man all right
[4:45] that's been our goal now I have to see
[4:47] how God you know unfolded himself and
[4:50] thank God for a truth of the message
[4:53] that we could follow it like that
[4:56] because where would we be if we didn't
[4:58] have those things you know of
[5:01] understanding if we didn't have the
[5:02] prophets message to be able to say those
[5:05] things because you know he would like I
[5:08] said he'd come up and he'd say in the
[5:10] beginning before the eternal well how
[5:13] can you comprehend that there's no way
[5:16] of doing it so we have to believe that a
[5:18] prophet had a way of going back into the
[5:21] mind of God and seeing God unveil
[5:25] himself downward to you and I that we
[5:29] would be able to see him and to
[5:32] understand because that's been the whole
[5:35] goal of mankind should be anyway of all
[5:38] mankind is to see how God unveils
[5:41] himself and manifest himself and then
[5:45] dropping down and we took the three
[5:47] thought point of what we've been at is
[5:49] to see how Jesus Christ came into being
[5:52] came down being Almighty God and the
[5:54] thing and then we picked up a little bit
[5:57] on studying of how Adam came into being
[6:03] and we'll try to finish that up if we
[6:05] can this morning and going into the
[6:08] point of seeing how you and I come into
[6:12] being all right because to me it's very
[6:17] vital to understand and I just say this
[6:20] with all love and respect to anyone but
[6:23] why wouldn't anybody starts of
[6:25] Christianity I don't care who it is the
[6:29] whole world of Christianity why would it
[6:32] not be the joy and the greatest
[6:36] opportunity that mankind could ever have
[6:40] is to be able to listen to a prophets
[6:44] message as he would bring to you and I
[6:48] the simplicity of how God does things
[6:52] and reveals himself you know I mean you
[6:57] remember when you first heard him in he
[6:59] he was expressing you know he said I'm a
[7:01] he's trying to explain one God you know
[7:04] he said I'm a father I'm a son I'm a
[7:07] human you know I've got to all of these
[7:10] titles to me but I'm just one well now
[7:14] where would a theologian ever been able
[7:15] to drop down that low enough to be able
[7:18] to talk that you and me could understand
[7:20] now they may understand each other in
[7:23] the realm of their great words you know
[7:26] of doing but to work that it would come
[7:30] down that the Bible says that the common
[7:32] people heard him gladly well I I swear I
[7:39] think God said he's allowed us common
[7:42] people you know just us old people that
[7:46] have a very little education and
[7:48] thoughts but yet would be able to
[7:51] understand God revealing himself and
[7:56] what would be his purpose and what would
[8:01] happen and how it would take place I
[8:04] mean maybe that don't thrill your heart
[8:08] to think about how that God would do
[8:11] that to make himself known you know
[8:15] people would spend millions of dollars
[8:17] if they had it trying to find out of
[8:20] their lineage you know and they'd say
[8:24] well well I
[8:24] I know those if I was adopted and I want
[8:27] to find my real lineage and you know how
[8:30] I've always been about that that's fine
[8:32] to do but you know how I've always been
[8:34] if I what in the deal
[8:36] they don't make no difference I was
[8:38] raised as woman so just leave me alone
[8:41] I'm happy as me and it would do me no
[8:44] good find out I was a Jones or a
[8:46] McGillicuddy that wouldn't change one
[8:48] thing in my life
[8:50] and I've always told you if you'd offer
[8:53] me me
[8:54] ian's of dollars to change I couldn't do
[8:58] it
[8:59] well because I'm just me you say you
[9:03] wouldn't change your name for millions
[9:05] of dollars nor would you say you're
[9:10] stupid I agree with you
[9:11] who are you you know I'm just a point
[9:16] that my point is if we can't hold on to
[9:19] our lives that who raised us you know
[9:25] you would be adopted into a family or
[9:28] something and somebody raised you and
[9:30] take care of you and supply you
[9:31] everything why would you not love that
[9:34] person more than you would your natural
[9:36] mom and daddy that throws you away that
[9:40] got rid of either puts you in a foster
[9:41] home and put you in a know it's our
[9:45] mentality of the human mind I want to
[9:48] know who I am never been satisfied being
[9:52] the Dales
[9:53] well okay you understand where I stand I
[9:59] stand in one thing I believe God has
[10:02] revealed to you and I his whole plan
[10:06] purpose being what he is and what he's
[10:09] trying to make manifest and show to you
[10:12] and I about himself and how that we are
[10:17] the children of God what could be a
[10:22] greater thing than to know about our
[10:25] family tree I hope you follow what I
[10:29] mean because I broke it in two parts I
[10:31] don't care about adopting into the find
[10:33] I'm trying to find a family tree I'm
[10:36] talking about when I'm born into I was
[10:39] born into the Dale family and I just
[10:41] want to stay that away all right now but
[10:45] what was our point we know that Jesus
[10:51] Christ is Almighty God all right
[10:54] we're not talking about a second person
[10:56] or a third person or anything like that
[10:58] he is the very person of Almighty God of
[11:01] looking at well ago
[11:02] he's the very heart and soul of Almighty
[11:06] God
[11:07] was Jesus Christ and what did he come to
[11:11] do what did that man outside man flesh
[11:14] man come to do reveal the man that was
[11:17] inside of him because the man is inside
[11:21] of him was Almighty God what a wonderful
[11:25] thought that we could have about those
[11:27] things all right now what did the
[11:29] prophets say about this great eternal
[11:32] God he said we can watch him unfold
[11:36] himself down to reveal himself to
[11:40] mankind and like I said the other day I
[11:43] was listening to it again and say you
[11:45] know you say well he ordered done it
[11:46] this way he ordered done it that way he
[11:49] don't need us to try to help him out you
[11:53] know well he could have had now see
[11:55] you're trying to make yourself something
[11:58] instead of trying to see what he is he
[12:01] done it his way and he ain't gonna
[12:03] change I don't care what we think about
[12:06] it what we can do we are the ones that
[12:09] stays in trouble because of what we try
[12:11] to do all right but now think about it
[12:15] God watching God condescend then we'll
[12:20] watch Adam come into being and then
[12:23] we'll watch ourselves come into being I
[12:25] want that three-part thought to stay in
[12:27] your mind because we can watch how that
[12:30] that God condescended down coming from
[12:34] the great eternal whatever you want to
[12:36] call him in the beginning before the
[12:38] eternal the the great words that you try
[12:41] to make of logos theophanies whatever
[12:43] you know is - seeing that God would be
[12:47] revealing himself to the very man that
[12:49] he created right now then we can see
[12:54] that how he condescended downward and
[12:57] became the word that was what we were on
[13:01] last Sunday you know see he is the word
[13:04] he's always been the word it was never a
[13:08] time that it wasn't word so I hope you'd
[13:10] understand what I'm saying I've tried to
[13:13] illustrate it I was a child I've become
[13:16] a father I've become a grandfather etc
[13:20] trying to show
[13:20] the way that God has I mean that we have
[13:23] condescended into our being but still
[13:26] stay the same person well no matter how
[13:29] many forms you see that God would reveal
[13:32] himself it's still the same one true and
[13:36] living God it's not many God's me it's
[13:41] one true and living God revealing
[13:43] himself so as he condescended downward
[13:46] what else could you say when Wren said
[13:50] out of the bosom of the father the son
[13:53] came into being well there's the son and
[13:56] I was a father
[13:57] we got a son I got a father I'm a son
[14:00] and I'm a father then the problem will
[14:02] me being one right well you know if that
[14:08] can be with the human race your lyrics
[14:10] in God
[14:11] alright see it was the great eternal
[14:15] condescending and the point I've always
[14:16] Illustrated make sure when you try to
[14:20] understand the condescending of God
[14:22] because I've watched this of mankind in
[14:24] the message and how the ministers try to
[14:26] explain it and when they'll take that
[14:29] all God was he put it in the cry all is
[14:32] all that's all at all then it all cry
[14:35] supportive loser and you wind up having
[14:37] nothing with you and that's the devil's
[14:40] understanding of God that's not our
[14:43] understanding all that God why would the
[14:47] Prophet use the word all because all
[14:50] that God was going to reveal to mankind
[14:56] condescended the word for him well why
[15:02] not didn't believe when the Prophet said
[15:03] that they would be a message of cheer
[15:06] down through the endless ages after we
[15:10] leave out of here
[15:12] what do you mean that means that
[15:15] there'll be an unveiling of God when we
[15:18] get dire that won't be these carnal
[15:20] thoughts in our mind to hinder us right
[15:23] within all God was cutting this take it
[15:26] up in a great big lump and pull him over
[15:28] drop him down and do away over here
[15:34] don't do away with God just do what he's
[15:39] saying he's still the father Jesus
[15:43] prayed to it you have any trouble friend
[15:45] to your father
[15:45] I thought we believed the Bible where
[15:49] Jesus said it one day he said you know
[15:51] there is a resurrection he said I go to
[15:53] my father and your father I go to my
[15:56] garden your car well see then God
[16:01] unveils himself but it doesn't move
[16:04] everything over to here and leave an
[16:06] empty space because if you do then you
[16:10] move everything from over to Christ and
[16:12] leaving it then when you move from
[16:14] Christ to the church you've done done
[16:16] away with God and the Christ
[16:17] I love heard you say that so many times
[16:22] and yep and you ever said around here
[16:25] you'll hear me say it a whole lot more
[16:27] because that thing is in the mind of
[16:30] mankind that it's hard to even speak
[16:33] about it because of the rebound that you
[16:36] get back of trying to move
[16:38] we just can't understand God why not you
[16:44] know why you can't understand God cause
[16:46] you don't want to because he's done all
[16:53] of the things and he's done down true to
[16:56] reveal himself to you and I that we
[16:59] could see him in the most simple terms
[17:02] that could ever be found out all right
[17:05] do you see what are you doing see then
[17:07] he came condescended down work is only
[17:12] way I can say it I don't know the
[17:13] education or whatever where the rest
[17:16] said he moved over in another form he
[17:18] had more feet he changed his form but he
[17:21] didn't change his person he's still the
[17:23] same person but he moved over to reveal
[17:26] in another form I didn't change persons
[17:30] coming from a child to a father to a
[17:32] grandfather to a great one that didn't
[17:35] change me it just changed the way that
[17:38] mankind was looking at me and the things
[17:42] that could be made manifest by that self
[17:45] saying one person
[17:47] well why can't we follow Garnett away
[17:51] then there wouldn't be any problem so
[17:53] then the profit why'd he say Jesus
[17:55] Christ God Himself come into human flesh
[17:59] when he started condescending he moved
[18:02] from this say father or whatever you
[18:04] wanna call it over into another form
[18:06] call the word there's John 1:1 there's
[18:13] first John right you ever read that one
[18:19] with John you ever read first John 1:1
[18:23] the martyr to read that some time
[18:27] because just explaining the same God all
[18:32] right
[18:32] see he moved over into our manifest
[18:38] himself in the form of the word to
[18:41] create alright so he created mankind he
[18:47] created all the world etc different
[18:49] times right all right now see then the
[18:53] Prophet said what did he do he said he
[18:57] brought that full word body now that's
[19:03] what we're trying to get to the point
[19:04] that we'll get to eventually we're
[19:06] brother Brown said you bypassed your
[19:07] theophany that's exactly right
[19:12] to come to flesh to be tempted that's
[19:17] exactly right
[19:18] well see Jesus never baptized well see
[19:22] we take my pipes like 285 going around
[19:24] Atlanta my pints doesn't mean that it
[19:31] simply means you never came that away is
[19:33] that an easy terminology of
[19:35] understanding he came word to flesh we
[19:42] didn't come word to flesh we come from
[19:47] the thoughts and things of Almighty God
[19:49] about mankind than any human flesh and a
[19:53] loss condition as we'll get to but
[19:58] that's what
[19:59] to get to see see he didn't have to come
[20:01] down los to do he came down to die for
[20:04] the loss all right
[20:07] he changed his form from one form to
[20:10] another to be able to come and manifest
[20:12] himself and what a wonderful thing to to
[20:17] do a prophet was explaining who
[20:19] Melchizedek was you know and even the
[20:21] theologians and the people you think
[20:23] that was God he said that was Almighty
[20:25] God
[20:28] he said because Jesus Christ he said the
[20:32] word come into melchester and he said
[20:36] then Melchizedek what about a way of a
[20:40] man expressing it
[20:41] he said Melchizedek was not seen anymore
[20:44] who is this Mel Chadwick now he said
[20:47] because he becomes Jesus Christ within
[20:52] that enough to see then Jesus Christ was
[20:54] Almighty God in human flesh that's why
[21:01] he could create right you know no
[21:07] problem with it he could create but now
[21:09] listen all right to try to get to the
[21:13] point we covered all of that about the
[21:16] Lord Jesus and descending and coming
[21:18] down and trying to understand that and
[21:21] follow into being and see who he was and
[21:24] how that he could he created you and me
[21:27] brought us into being of the children of
[21:30] God he created us naturally as flesh
[21:33] back in the beginning the same God is
[21:35] the Lord Jesus Christ right because even
[21:38] what is it if is Ephesians 3 and 9 where
[21:41] he created all things by Jesus Christ
[21:45] season is not a Father Son and Holy
[21:48] Ghost to try to divide it up into
[21:50] persons there's a Father Son and Holy
[21:53] Ghost who try to understand the one
[21:55] person right exactly all right now then
[22:01] in understanding that he was the word he
[22:05] was a word body and what is it theophany
[22:10] then a word body the Prophet
[22:14] huh a word body and he called it the
[22:19] logos or speech because the word thought
[22:22] I've got them laying there on the desk
[22:25] you can look at the word thought is is
[22:27] expended as being a word that can be
[22:29] used as thought or speech in other words
[22:31] you think something you speak it see God
[22:35] thought it and he spoke it and it come
[22:37] into being okay all right see then let's
[22:40] get down there and think about Adam
[22:41] because knowing God coming that way we
[22:44] know there's no problems with that right
[22:47] but how did Adam come into being all
[22:51] right seeing and do we think about Adam
[22:54] in his part that he comes into being as
[22:59] a human being
[23:01] oh well God just created him what did he
[23:06] create you the same way and remember my
[23:12] whole story last Sunday was what Adam
[23:18] was God's example child son child
[23:26] offspring whatever Adam came a special
[23:33] way that's you and I didn't come Adam
[23:40] came down a line a special way to us and
[23:45] we were talking about it and what did
[23:47] the Prophet say Adam now keeping it in
[23:56] mind and he was his example child what
[24:00] are you and I to be he gave an Adam what
[24:08] he wanted all of his children to be can
[24:13] you follow that and think about in Adam
[24:16] were shown the example you're not the
[24:20] weight of Jesus Christ because Jesus
[24:22] Christ was that Almighty God that never
[24:24] had a fallen condition never
[24:26] any problems with that he came down that
[24:30] line to come into manifestation no
[24:36] fallen condition right uh-huh
[24:41] what's he Adam he said you come like
[24:48] Adam like me who is this milk Saturday
[24:52] and then we'll repeat this in a minute
[24:53] so they don't have to pull up into one a
[24:56] did you become like Adam like me you
[25:00] became from the attribute to the flesh
[25:03] to be tempted now Adam see that's our
[25:10] arguments with it we try to finalize
[25:13] everything by our own arguments that
[25:15] won't work but remember Adam was created
[25:19] perfect right no sinful condition now
[25:27] because God can't create something
[25:29] sinful where would he get the products
[25:32] to bring it forward all right so now
[25:36] Adam came first in Genesis 1:26 and 27
[25:43] cuz that's what your Bible said said let
[25:46] us make man and her on the image and let
[25:52] them have dominion over the fish of the
[25:54] sea over the ever let the man that he
[25:58] would create the Adam how did he create
[26:00] Adam first a spirit being like himself
[26:09] and he was put over the garden to rule
[26:12] the garden but there wasn't no man to
[26:18] till the soil see Genesis 1:26 10 and
[26:22] 127 in there it was that man staying in
[26:27] that position he could have not fallen
[26:32] there was no way Adam could have fallen
[26:34] from the 126 man will get to it in him
[26:39] anywhere he breathed into his nostrils
[26:40] and he become a living soul yeah but
[26:47] remember that was the way God wanted him
[26:49] to come cuz that was the way he wanted
[26:52] you and I to come so how did Adam come
[27:00] what did the prophets say about it they
[27:03] said brother Branham said what's the
[27:05] difference between the Genesis 1:26 man
[27:08] and to seven lamb he said to 1:26 man
[27:13] was in the image of God said then he was
[27:18] put into flesh into seven and become a
[27:23] living soul right then as being put down
[27:31] that's when the Lord breathed into the
[27:34] nostrils of Adam and he became a living
[27:37] soul
[27:39] what in other words they said brother
[27:42] Branham what how he said he put plain
[27:44] language this saying it he took Genesis
[27:48] 1:26 and 27 man
[27:50] the spirit man and he put him in flesh
[27:57] that's simple language in it he just put
[28:00] him in flash now what did he do as he
[28:04] was putting him in flesh what was he
[28:05] doing he breathed into him right forgive
[28:11] me for coughing I'll get it I have to
[28:14] slow down then so I guess maybe in this
[28:17] old age then life comes to where you
[28:18] have to slow down and get all right just
[28:21] forgive me for coughing but now what so
[28:29] the example children of God the example
[28:34] Adam the example child with what not any
[28:41] sin involved not any perversion involved
[28:45] not anything wrong in Genesis creating
[28:51] perfect
[28:54] the 126 man was eternal life we'll read
[29:02] that in just a minute and you'll see as
[29:04] much as I've read over and over and over
[29:05] to you and talk about theophany or to be
[29:07] able to at least understand some of it
[29:09] if not then you better wake up and go
[29:12] back and listen to some tapes or do
[29:13] something because I've tried my best to
[29:16] express to you see that 126 and 127 man
[29:21] he could not follow that was God's own
[29:26] life that was God how could God follow
[29:33] that was the spirit man the Prophet see
[29:37] that was the theophany man he said so
[29:42] Adam was created in the image of God
[29:47] which would have been word image because
[29:54] God was the word so he's in the image of
[29:59] God all right Zach likeness the Bible
[30:02] would say in other words why not just
[30:05] say it in plain language that is the
[30:06] life of God the Genesis 1:26 and 27 man
[30:10] is the life of God now what else are you
[30:12] gonna call it go through the message we
[30:17] went over and over and over the Prophet
[30:18] were that he talks about Adam coming
[30:20] into being and how the Eve was in still
[30:25] in theophany he said and Adam was
[30:27] already in theophany ruling the animals
[30:29] de nieve had to be brought down from
[30:31] that position the place with Adam to
[30:35] where he would have been in the right
[30:36] order alright now don't do no wrong by
[30:40] putting even - Adam now that will be the
[30:46] product that will cause us to fall yes
[30:49] but that's not the eternal part you
[30:55] probably agreed with as our second ago
[30:57] when I said it so now let's see if you
[30:59] agree with is that 1:26 man was eternal
[31:02] God
[31:04] that was God imparting his own life
[31:07] right within if he was in that then she
[31:13] had to be an impartation of God's life
[31:15] when that don't make her wrong we're
[31:19] gonna get to it in a minute when Brett
[31:21] around gets down to say that comes to
[31:23] free moral agency is where the problem
[31:25] came he was created the way God wanted
[31:30] mankind to be was Adam and Eve was in
[31:35] the same creation code I didn't say it
[31:38] run around and said she was in Adam in
[31:40] physical creation you know the real he
[31:43] said she was in Adam and the theophany
[31:49] so then you gotta have her as a very
[31:51] part of that of God so don't have hurt
[31:55] with the ability to fall at that
[31:56] situation Adam and Eve as when to that
[32:03] position of Genesis 1:20 said there's no
[32:05] way that could fall because that was the
[32:11] very life of God they got to be put into
[32:15] flash or you can speak of the fall and
[32:21] by being put into flash what happened
[32:27] see that's what you can't read these
[32:29] things in in the grievers Almanac and
[32:33] you can't read them in the theological
[32:35] terminologies of mankind about
[32:38] Christianity we got a letter today my
[32:42] brother boy he was letting us a bit
[32:44] about believing in brother Branham of
[32:46] being you know the message of the hour
[32:48] coming in all he was attacked in the
[32:50] serpent seed and he was doing all kind
[32:52] of thing and all at once right in the
[32:54] middle of it he just blowed his own
[32:56] story out to wind the different because
[33:00] he said but there is one thing you know
[33:03] and he him right and I could just see
[33:05] him but there is you know see you can't
[33:09] do it I don't care what you do or who
[33:12] the theologian goat are this message
[33:14] down
[33:15] because this is too simple because he's
[33:18] gonna have to admit himself there's
[33:22] right he's gonna have to bring it in
[33:25] fail see cuz he's a human being all
[33:27] right I just giggle and say okay Lord
[33:30] bless the brother let him go you know no
[33:33] problems but now listen see without a
[33:38] prophet to understand you and I would
[33:41] have no answers for any of it no more
[33:43] than the theologians would have now you
[33:48] read up on your theological side or read
[33:51] up on the mankind of Genesis 1:26 and 27
[33:55] you might in some way find terminologies
[33:59] or thoughts coming that it was finally
[34:02] that man Dyer was put into 2:7 basically
[34:07] you'd find them to say in 2:7 is the man
[34:10] of 1:26 and 27 all right but what about
[34:14] a prophet and the way he explained it
[34:16] but that's been the hardest thing
[34:18] because I spent 40 something years
[34:21] expressing this one thought that God
[34:26] breathed into Adams and Austral eternal
[34:29] life go find somebody will explain it to
[34:43] you like that in the message or out of
[34:47] the message oh you're getting sarcastic
[34:50] no I'm just telling the truth about it
[34:54] how many times have you ever heard that
[34:57] Adam had eternal life and especially
[35:02] when you going over a little father that
[35:04] Adam fell from eternal life did you see
[35:15] God's Word is true but there's no way
[35:18] you'll find those understandings in your
[35:20] theological realms or the lines or
[35:22] anything but you go to a simple prophet
[35:25] and let him explain it so he explains
[35:31] God in his condescending he explains
[35:36] it's not another God or another another
[35:37] person he doesn't move over into another
[35:39] position what he just moves over as
[35:41] another form Father Son and Holy Ghost
[35:44] you can't understand one God without
[35:45] father son and holy go come on are you
[35:49] trying to do away with father son Holy
[35:51] Ghost try to be a oneness no you you you
[35:55] can't understand one God without father
[35:57] son and holy God God who's the creator
[35:59] and who doesn't want you got to have
[36:03] Father Son and Holy Ghost to understand
[36:05] the one true and living God your prophet
[36:07] said he's not a Trinity but he said he's
[36:10] a triune being he didn't said Trinity of
[36:16] beings he said a triune being a trial
[36:20] and being means one being with many
[36:23] manifestations we would have never got
[36:29] that from the intellectual side that
[36:32] when you moved to say Genesis 2:1 26 and
[36:35] 27 was Adam and that Adam in the Garden
[36:40] ruled the animals and the thing as in
[36:42] that theophany that word body that he
[36:46] was in a part of God I'm quoting from
[36:51] brother branham message after message a
[36:53] part of God come into being rather
[36:58] Bramley even explained how the word
[37:00] comes over and said that's a part of God
[37:02] how much more is it to see that Adam the
[37:10] Genesis 1:26 man Adam was a part of God
[37:15] he puts that into human flesh and that's
[37:20] what he wanted to do with every one of
[37:22] us
[37:27] to start us off right so how did he
[37:29] start Adam off
[37:30] okay lemon we'll go ahead brothers will
[37:32] pick up let's go to number three I hope
[37:36] you followed what I'm talking about the
[37:38] prophet of God said he took the 126 man
[37:41] put him in to the to seven the to seven
[37:46] to 126 is let us make man in our image
[37:48] or likeness and let them have dominion
[37:50] and he created two seven says the Lord
[37:53] God formed of the dust of the ground and
[37:56] breathed into his nostrils the breath of
[37:59] life and man became a living soul now
[38:04] every body by natural birth is a living
[38:08] soul right that's the difference in the
[38:12] human and their animals are none we have
[38:14] the soul all right when the baby is born
[38:17] God breathes the breath of life into
[38:20] that baby and it becomes a living soul
[38:23] but that's not eternal life there
[38:27] brother branham is so technical and I
[38:29] know it those everybody saw but he said
[38:32] it's not what nature doing he says what
[38:37] God does so now let's listen and get a
[38:41] thought he's explaining all right we're
[38:44] on go ahead the number uh should be on
[38:48] number three you're on number two let's
[38:51] go to number three all right this is
[38:54] taken from blasphemous names and he's
[38:55] explaining the difference with the
[38:57] breath that you breathe is not the soul
[38:59] that's what your your people believe
[39:01] some of them you know believe in that
[39:03] you you breathe out and you breathe in
[39:05] and everything breathes it's just a
[39:06] living it's just a soul it's just a
[39:08] solace and he's explaining that's not
[39:11] right all right now moving on up to
[39:14] where we get to the point
[39:15] see ya now take the scripture
[39:20] he's did they take the scripture that
[39:24] God breathed breath into his nostrils
[39:26] and he became a living soul see he says
[39:28] what was he before he breathed huh
[39:33] now come on down to where we can get to
[39:35] the point you read in between and it's
[39:37] this see cuz this is what he's doing
[39:40] he's expressing
[39:40] their argument is not right he said
[39:42] cause if you breathe in an animal
[39:44] breathe in and out you do back and forth
[39:45] he said that's not true
[39:47] now he's explaining but what's who he's
[39:50] explaining he's explaining God first
[39:55] creation Adam Adam was his first
[40:03] original creation now don't forget to
[40:06] thought then for Adam is the example
[40:09] creation that's what he wants out of me
[40:11] in you and when it's finished we read it
[40:15] out of here when this is finished that
[40:18] man will come forth the way he's
[40:21] supposed to come right when it's
[40:25] finished it'll come to that don't worry
[40:27] about it
[40:27] look what God did he breathed the breath
[40:32] of eternal life he's talking about Adam
[40:37] right amen he become a living soul that
[40:41] can't die and as I said we're gonna get
[40:45] here in a minute where he gets to see
[40:47] him he said Adam God well he's a matter
[40:50] of fact he says here he's so perfect in
[40:54] his statements that's what amazes me it
[40:58] amazes me to look at something and I'm
[41:00] reading it and I look at the Word of God
[41:02] my the wait a minute now there's
[41:04] something wrong because the statements
[41:05] not exactly true this way there's
[41:08] something ain't lining up and I go
[41:10] backwards and forth and all at once he
[41:13] looked down he's hey he was right you
[41:16] don't ever do that I just do two
[41:19] checking it out see what works you know
[41:21] I love to take this message and check it
[41:23] with the Bible I thought was supposed to
[41:27] do that you know I thought that was the
[41:30] way we don't understand it was a right
[41:31] word okay come on look what God did he
[41:38] breathed the breath of eternal life and
[41:42] he became a living soul a soul that
[41:45] can't die so Adam didn't get just life
[41:49] as a living soul that all mankind gets
[41:53] after the Fallen condition
[41:54] Oh dad for the following condition God
[41:56] can't breathe eternal life into your
[41:58] nostrils you have to have a new birth
[42:02] mother breath even though the church is
[42:05] worn by the breath of God we got to have
[42:07] we'll get to it but look and watch we're
[42:09] going to get into honey plum her elbows
[42:11] breathe the breath of eternal life into
[42:14] his nostrils and he became an eternal
[42:17] soul that was Adam and what's cause God
[42:24] breathed not what nature doesn't we
[42:27] thought nature when you say in nature
[42:29] done nature is just life that gives you
[42:32] life when you're born you spank the baby
[42:34] come yet we know God has to give it to
[42:36] you but he's explaining nature does that
[42:38] that's a form of nature but God's
[42:41] different God breed not what nature
[42:45] doing but what God did breathe the
[42:47] breath of life into his nostrils and he
[42:48] became a living soul then you say to me
[42:51] Adam died brother branham
[43:03] and so beautiful but remember before
[43:10] Adam died he had a lamb that redeemed
[43:15] him would you go to Genesis and look at
[43:23] it and just think on what he's saying
[43:31] see before Adam died Adam lived to be
[43:38] nine hundred and something years old I
[43:41] think that's right in it
[43:47] that's before he died
[43:53] so genesis 3:15 i'll put enmity between
[43:57] thy seed and the seed of the one the
[44:02] spiritually condition of the fall had
[44:04] come into existence but the natural
[44:05] thing had not though brother brems right
[44:13] you say brother branham that adam fail
[44:17] he died said what remember before adam
[44:21] died he had a lamb that redeemed him
[44:24] hallelujah
[44:25] those were before he knew is called a
[44:27] lamb to redeemed them that was a type he
[44:31] was a type Adam fell then the lamb was
[44:34] provided for Adam because already in his
[44:37] nostrils had become the breath of the
[44:40] eternal God now remember the words up
[44:45] here he become a living soul he can't
[44:48] die look then the lamb was provided for
[44:55] Adam because already and his nostrils
[44:59] had become the breath of the eternal God
[45:04] and he become a living soul he was a son
[45:08] of God now this breath is the African
[45:13] word Amalia
[45:15] and things senator to breathe that
[45:18] listen said why would we struggle for
[45:21] eternal life if that's the eternal soul
[45:23] breathed into by breath know the words
[45:26] of you that's breathing in and breathing
[45:27] out and animals breathing in now why do
[45:29] you search for you turn a lot that would
[45:31] mean you would have life why don't you
[45:35] search for it are you listening to it
[45:37] why would we struggle for eternal life
[45:39] that backfires brother see it just can't
[45:41] do it
[45:42] but God look at the word I like that and
[45:45] it took me a long time to find that word
[45:48] because I was trying to say but God
[45:52] especially I was trying to say
[45:57] especially because that was the thought
[45:58] in my mind was the quote is God
[46:01] especially it wouldn't look God
[46:04] specially not that expecially something
[46:10] out right a phone Adam breathe the
[46:13] breath of eternal life and he become an
[46:15] eternal person with God and he's
[46:19] explaining Adam and his coming look he
[46:25] had power like God now remember when the
[46:29] 1:26 man had the power in the garden
[46:32] right but then when he breathed into his
[46:34] nostrils become living so the natural
[46:37] man was standing there right the natural
[46:40] man had the ruling of the garden right
[46:45] not just the spiritual man as inside it
[46:48] was the whole man Adam was standing that
[46:51] ruler brother Brent said he's the ruler
[46:53] of the earth he said God's the ruler of
[46:55] heaven he said he's the child of God
[46:57] he's the son of God look he had power
[47:00] like God he was an amateur God he was
[47:02] God of the earth not God of heaven now
[47:05] God of the earth someday the sons of God
[47:09] will again become gods come on Jesus
[47:15] said so you did not written in your law
[47:18] okay so God breathed into Adams nostrils
[47:23] and he became a living soul
[47:27] now that doesn't happen
[47:28] to you and I remember that God don't
[47:32] breathe into our nostril to the baby and
[47:34] we become into the world with eternal
[47:35] life now don't go that far because you
[47:39] got all these doctrines in the message
[47:40] oh wow it was eternal you know they got
[47:45] all these things in the message you
[47:47] don't see I'm not fighting no
[47:49] denominational person out there I
[47:51] thought the people of this message I
[47:52] don't find her I thought me and you to
[47:55] keep me and you from getting caught up
[47:57] into these times but look what he says
[48:02] he said what you said would Adam died
[48:04] brother brother Brennan now how could a
[48:11] dumb die with eternal life now come on
[48:19] I'm not the one that's establishing
[48:21] Browns establishing that God especially
[48:23] in the specialty in the Adam give him
[48:26] eternal life and made him an eternal
[48:28] person now how can he fall if he's an
[48:36] eternal person what happened doctor what
[48:44] took place right there you can't take an
[48:51] eternal person and let them fall if you
[48:56] have eternal life today by the new birth
[48:58] there's no way that you could ever fall
[49:00] now you can die right you can die but he
[49:08] can't take away the eternal life you how
[49:14] Adam had eternal life nine hundred and
[49:18] some years eve had eternal life that's
[49:23] gonna be one that you ain't gonna live
[49:24] preacher don't like that one cuz it they
[49:25] want to women to be some garbage they
[49:27] want them to be secondary video they
[49:29] don't like it that they don't like him
[49:31] but if he was in Adam and theophany and
[49:34] Adam was eternal then he was eternal
[49:39] come on that's why I ended your services
[49:43] up I cry because the words I use but I
[49:45] do it so hard to try to get you to think
[49:49] brother Dale I've got eternal life I
[49:51] can't die you know that a lot of people
[49:54] years ago there was two brothers
[49:55] especially talked that they could never
[49:57] die physically they are dead they did
[50:05] but they talked they couldn't I said
[50:09] well you're in bad shape say well how
[50:11] can a manifested Son of God died I said
[50:14] I don't know why don't you ask Adam and
[50:17] I said after all why don't you ask Jesus
[50:19] how he died right because they did but
[50:29] that's what we got to get to now see and
[50:30] I know we won't get to the full part of
[50:31] the message we're going which means me
[50:33] I'll be doing the preaching okay so
[50:34] we'll take care of that now what
[50:41] happened to Adam remember he was the
[50:45] example son he was to be Adam and Eve
[50:51] was to be the example children of God
[50:55] because they were the children of God
[50:57] they were the offspring of God in soul
[51:01] but their body was not eternal come on
[51:07] their body wasn't eternal cuz it was a
[51:09] creation any things creatives got two
[51:12] beginnings got a beginning
[51:13] it ain't eternal gotta be made eternal
[51:15] to have to be that all right so that's
[51:19] where Adam came what first as to 1:26
[51:23] man Adam and Eve were both in that
[51:26] in the 1:26 called the Bible said let us
[51:29] make man and he made them not him them
[51:38] he made it male and female which would
[51:41] have been what God wanted to be but to
[51:50] follow came into being but now here's
[51:55] where you got to study with me for a
[51:56] second to think
[51:57] see we think well God's got all these
[51:59] attributes in him it had to be this way
[52:00] it had to be that way he didn't make it
[52:02] happen
[52:03] now you make him make it happen you got
[52:06] a problem mainly mental is that good
[52:12] enough
[52:13] don't make God making something happen
[52:16] we get through in time we'll get to it
[52:19] free moral agency puts us all that's why
[52:22] we're screaming at the end of the
[52:23] message Sunday afternoon don't you think
[52:26] that you're a Christian and you can't go
[52:27] out and do wrong you right in the
[52:30] devil's trial a born-again Christian can
[52:38] do wrong but they can't be lost but they
[52:47] can do wrong remember here's another one
[52:52] that the denomination I don't never food
[52:54] will brethren said a Christian is the
[52:59] only woman that can sin he said a sinner
[53:02] doesn't sin he's condemned on a higher
[53:05] level he's done to start with he said
[53:07] it's the Christian that has sins
[53:10] yeah but I'm Christian I don't sin
[53:12] that's where your liar that makes it a
[53:14] bigger Center in the building I like
[53:17] what we would it was a jackhole that
[53:18] said that time that lady told him said I
[53:20] have trouble with my tongue and things
[53:23] that I can't control it
[53:24] he said lady said this ain't enough room
[53:26] up here to put your tongue called this
[53:27] pulpits only 14 foot what you know
[53:30] across here ain't enough room to put
[53:32] your tongue in other words he was
[53:33] telling her she's she was lying like
[53:35] crazy but see we think Oh
[53:40] now remember a Christian a born-again
[53:42] Christian can never be lost get that
[53:46] settled never be lost
[53:52] you can never die and go to hell because
[53:54] you got to put eternal life into hell it
[53:57] won't work
[53:58] we can be taken off the scene because we
[54:01] won't straighten up because that's what
[54:03] the Bible says and many sleep all right
[54:08] don't ever get to the point of you think
[54:11] well I can't do wrong right there you've
[54:13] already done wrong we'll get to it
[54:15] eventually when we find out what the
[54:17] fault what the sin was what I'm trying
[54:20] to get you to look at Adam and to just
[54:24] see what Adam what he was the example
[54:26] child the way Adam was brought was God's
[54:30] intention to bring all mankind by the
[54:33] way you know all true born-again
[54:34] Christians but now also he knew and he
[54:40] had to plan and he knew the thing and
[54:42] there was attributes that had to be
[54:43] displayed of Savior healer etc you
[54:46] realized that if we were the only
[54:48] children of the children of God we're
[54:50] the only ones brought into being all
[54:52] these other people wouldn't be in the
[54:53] world there wouldn't be no foolish
[54:56] virgins there wouldn't be no people like
[54:58] that to be given eternal life just to
[55:03] Gail you just think one of these days
[55:04] somebody walk up to you and glory and
[55:06] say thank you thank you for accepting
[55:10] the word in the end time they because I
[55:14] wouldn't be here I'm just a foolish
[55:16] virgin I would just give an eternal life
[55:18] but if you hadn't have fallen if things
[55:20] hadn't went wrong
[55:22] that's not justifying falling no God
[55:26] knew was gonna do that but get the point
[55:31] brother Branham says blatt in blaspheme
[55:34] his name Adam fail Adam died he said he
[55:42] died all right now watch him let's go on
[55:46] up and pick up going up to number five
[55:48] let's get this and we'll try to finish
[55:51] it
[55:53] which is taken from the seal book on the
[55:55] breach we won't read all the way down
[55:58] but we'll pick it up as we go down
[56:00] because the Prophet is explaining what
[56:05] happened in the garden and what took
[56:10] place
[56:12] he says there's something lost miss
[56:16] groaning he's trying to get back in this
[56:18] original condition would you imagine
[56:20] somebody fouled in etc he said it's not
[56:22] in its original state man struck by
[56:24] disease just wrote it to keep rolling it
[56:26] struck by diseases aches and pains and
[56:29] groanings he's not in his right position
[56:31] everybody knows that I mean all right
[56:32] and he says what they're not in out to
[56:36] be conditioned they have fallen from
[56:38] somewhere yeah
[56:41] now watch him of what he explains
[56:45] paragraph 91 to the breach and you don't
[56:49] need anybody to interpret that forest
[56:51] for of course we know it was eternal
[56:55] life they had fallen from they they now
[57:01] watch that they they they because that
[57:03] day is gonna be you in a minute
[57:05] but they it who Adam and Eve they lost
[57:11] their claims on eternal life by the fall
[57:13] of Adam so that day is not just Adam and
[57:16] Eve but it would start with Adam and Eve
[57:18] day is you and me who fell from eternal
[57:24] life to death in the Garden of Eden and
[57:27] brought all nature under them to death
[57:31] now but you just you confuse me you just
[57:38] got to expound and expounding you found
[57:41] that a true born-again Christian that
[57:43] have eternal life can't fall and that's
[57:48] right
[57:55] what is ever born again believers still
[57:58] alive today what happened
[58:05] they died is that simple they died right
[58:16] and what's happening to you and me we're
[58:18] dying but you can't die in Seoul so now
[58:26] you've got to make a statement that's
[58:29] what people they differ with me about
[58:31] enough well we don't need nobody to
[58:32] explain it we just read what the Prophet
[58:35] says read what the Prophet said the
[58:38] Prophet said you could not die the
[58:42] Prophet said had a mid die
[58:47] now you've got a direct contradiction
[58:49] right there somewhere according to my
[58:52] English understanding I have a very
[58:53] small amount of English but according to
[58:56] wording I think that statement is right
[58:58] if you say you can't die and then say
[59:01] you can die
[59:02] that seems somewhere somebody's messed
[59:04] up well that's what I do
[59:12] I don't problem problem they'll fault
[59:16] with this for 40 50 years ain't worried
[59:17] about it now because this is what I
[59:19] thought 40 years ago from the same quote
[59:23] what that brother branham explains on
[59:30] blasphemous names which was prior to
[59:33] preaching the seals would have been 62
[59:36] right in there somewhere less demon's
[59:38] name
[59:38] he explained that God breathed into the
[59:42] nostrils of Adam eternal life and he
[59:46] became an eternal person with God and
[59:49] the quote is dire he said and could not
[59:52] follow we see they caught it on the iron
[59:57] they brought it to his attention on that
[59:59] somebody enter code he picked it up
[1:00:01] maybe the congregation he said what you
[1:00:03] saying with brother branham Adam died he
[1:00:08] said before
[1:00:09] he died he had a lamb bra which would
[1:00:21] automatically seal him to the point that
[1:00:23] he couldn't be destroyed
[1:00:24] now listen and you know Adam wouldn't
[1:00:29] destroyed physically he said wait a
[1:00:32] minute
[1:00:33] I didn't say he didn't die and rotting
[1:00:34] went to the ground of the chemicals no
[1:00:36] that's all right but one day he's going
[1:00:39] to rage right in the body he's going to
[1:00:45] rage now you get to the shields message
[1:00:54] he says they've fallen from somewhere
[1:00:58] pull that back up
[1:01:00] notice these days they they they now
[1:01:03] because that means you but when he died
[1:01:11] as I said in the message this morning to
[1:01:13] saying he sold out our sold out our
[1:01:16] birthright and crossed this chasm
[1:01:18] now we're beyond the reach of God on
[1:01:21] this other side of the castle listen now
[1:01:24] of course when Adam fell to death he
[1:01:28] brought death upon all creation now he
[1:01:31] was giving given free more agency it was
[1:01:36] given to them as we sow to make a choice
[1:01:39] and Adam and Eve in the beginning there
[1:01:42] was a tree of right and wrong before
[1:01:43] them and that same tree sets before each
[1:01:46] never one of us died on God isn't doing
[1:01:49] for Adam Eve see say he's doing an a lot
[1:01:51] it's not it's well it's their fault no
[1:01:54] no it's not their fault
[1:01:57] well I did God my God knows I can happen
[1:02:00] I sold I know it's your fault now come
[1:02:05] on you got to place it on yourself
[1:02:07] because right and wrong is set before
[1:02:09] you we're on the same basis as Adam and
[1:02:11] Eve okay now but what about
[1:02:21] that Adam and Eve fell to death okay
[1:02:31] they fell to death now what was the
[1:02:34] death they fell to now I'm going to use
[1:02:39] the terminology spread around use did
[1:02:41] you try to emphasize over and over he
[1:02:44] used on who is this Melchizedek you've
[1:02:46] talking about that theophany nothing
[1:02:47] like that and he said and you bypass
[1:02:49] that we'll see we want to try to make
[1:02:53] something like 285 oh you know well
[1:03:00] according to that you didn't by face it
[1:03:02] Lana you circled it
[1:03:04] that's just plain common language I'm
[1:03:06] calming myself but what happened Jesus
[1:03:16] came word to flesh no problem
[1:03:22] Adam came with eternal life breathed
[1:03:26] into his nostrils as he had stepped in
[1:03:31] to are put to 1:26 man into the 2:7 the
[1:03:35] natural man it didn't give that body
[1:03:39] eternal life as only the soul that was
[1:03:43] eternal so what didn't happen when the
[1:03:48] fall came into being I remember we got
[1:03:52] the scripture so we're going back on
[1:03:54] remember Adam wasn't deceived exactly
[1:03:57] rock or Adam knew exactly what he's
[1:03:59] doing what about a man knowing exactly
[1:04:03] what he's doing he done it you realize
[1:04:08] what that statement is making Adam knew
[1:04:11] what he's doing
[1:04:12] he knew that if he took Eve he was
[1:04:16] selling the whole human race to death
[1:04:20] already himself knowing he was dying
[1:04:29] knowing something had happened over
[1:04:31] there when things went wrong and God
[1:04:34] came down and talked to him so Adam was
[1:04:37] not deceived he knew what he was doing
[1:04:41] you want to I hear people and I'm not
[1:04:43] throwing on them people will say well he
[1:04:46] taught Christ and doing this that and
[1:04:47] the other that's okay that's that's fine
[1:04:50] but just be real careful how you have
[1:04:52] Adam type in Christ because you can't
[1:04:54] break it over because the people of this
[1:04:56] message bring it over that Adam injected
[1:04:59] into Eve his seed physically to save her
[1:05:04] now that's in the message people and a
[1:05:06] big portion of it and a lot of you know
[1:05:09] their names and them on the telephone
[1:05:11] numbers but that's the way they believe
[1:05:16] it I don't believe it that way mm-hmm
[1:05:22] you can't make it that way you can't
[1:05:24] make sex a savior I thought that was
[1:05:31] default I mean that was somewhere it got
[1:05:34] messed up on this thing you say but yet
[1:05:40] he took her brother Adam explain to Adam
[1:05:42] took her and held her yes I'll ask you a
[1:05:52] question while we're on the talk you say
[1:05:59] Adam done this and Adam done that and it
[1:06:02] saved Eve I would ask you to explain to
[1:06:04] me and would you mind telling me whether
[1:06:07] this is right or not that sin in the
[1:06:09] presence of God one split second and
[1:06:11] you're dead it don't have to be thirty
[1:06:15] minutes or an hour ride everybody with
[1:06:17] me you did right cause it's unbelief you
[1:06:23] did you don't have to go three days and
[1:06:26] then wind up being dead Adam from the
[1:06:31] minute he walked out of that garden he
[1:06:33] knew he was dying
[1:06:38] cuz you see it was an atom that
[1:06:41] preserved Eve
[1:06:42] I quoted this scripture to those some of
[1:06:45] those believers I thought that he stood
[1:06:48] as a lamb slain before the foundation of
[1:06:50] the world I thought that's what took
[1:06:53] care of Adam and Eve
[1:06:54] from the point of the sin to the point
[1:06:56] that God could make the atonement now am
[1:07:00] i right if I'm not I'd like to explain
[1:07:03] that to me what took care of Adam and
[1:07:06] Eve from the time they send to the time
[1:07:09] that the atonement was made you see
[1:07:21] where you stand it
[1:07:23] you know you're guilty and you won't
[1:07:25] admit it you won't admit that that
[1:07:27] statement is right but it is seeing in
[1:07:31] the Fredericks of God one split second
[1:07:32] you're dead but you see there was a time
[1:07:40] element allows between the sin and the
[1:07:45] point of God making an atonement
[1:07:47] they wouldn't Adam it was God's almighty
[1:07:52] word that preserved both of them
[1:07:55] it didn't just preserve Adam it
[1:07:59] preserved them both because they were
[1:08:01] both standing there from the split
[1:08:05] second they done they were dying took a
[1:08:13] hundred unheard years read them to come
[1:08:15] to final death but that's fine just
[1:08:17] remember in between are the prophets
[1:08:19] said he made an atonement so you
[1:08:20] understand are you with me now and
[1:08:25] wasn't something somebody done to do
[1:08:26] this or done to do that
[1:08:28] he's got atonement himself he's won it
[1:08:32] ripped him skins off their manuals and
[1:08:36] placed him on Adam and Eve come on you
[1:08:39] know what brother Bryan said Adam and
[1:08:40] Eve was doing from the time that they
[1:08:41] had sinned
[1:08:42] there's over in the bushes you know what
[1:08:45] he said just do it having church and
[1:08:49] your tech quote he said they were over
[1:08:51] in the bush he's having church
[1:08:55] you know she was trying to convince Adam
[1:08:57] and she was right because he's still
[1:08:59] doing it now she the church is still
[1:09:07] trying to show how good it is what it is
[1:09:09] what this is what Evans does there I am
[1:09:11] lost now are you with me what I'm saying
[1:09:19] Adam then fell to natural death in the
[1:09:27] garden he didn't lose his soul he didn't
[1:09:33] lose eternal life in his soul and his
[1:09:35] body was not eternal right his body
[1:09:43] wasn't eternal his body was a creation
[1:09:45] so he fell to natural death not the
[1:09:51] death of the soul because you can't have
[1:09:54] eternal life and lose it
[1:09:58] well I kind of think you can look got a
[1:10:03] hipper thinking but listen see the
[1:10:11] difference between Adam and me and you a
[1:10:16] second oh thank you you know clear
[1:10:18] 5-point law see there's a difference
[1:10:21] between you and way me and you coming
[1:10:23] away Adam comment called Adam came word
[1:10:28] theophany put right in the flesh
[1:10:35] the fall brought us all to a lost
[1:10:38] condition so no matter who it is none of
[1:10:41] us are born with eternal life were born
[1:10:46] lost a psalmist explaining it morning's
[1:10:51] in shaping an iniquity espousing from
[1:10:54] the mother's womb and going forth a liar
[1:10:57] doomed it on our way to hell oh but I've
[1:11:01] always water turn well then I guess
[1:11:07] you're better off and Adam was just
[1:11:14] remember to have eternal life you must
[1:11:17] receive eternal life the natural life
[1:11:21] Burt breathed into you as a baby doesn't
[1:11:23] give you eternal life
[1:11:26] now come on you say well well well we
[1:11:29] got right well then why was Jesus's
[1:11:31] first doctrine what was Jesus's first
[1:11:34] doctrine come on
[1:11:38] looking at him this morning got him
[1:11:40] laying on the dead Jesus's first
[1:11:42] doctrine was you must be born again why
[1:11:45] would you must be born again if you
[1:11:47] already got to eternal life all you need
[1:11:49] to be born again well you just need to
[1:11:51] wake up find out always was eternal
[1:11:53] well help yourself you and ask me don't
[1:12:00] ever ask me brother Dale why are we
[1:12:02] still here 50 years after the prophets
[1:12:04] come don't ask me that
[1:12:05] if you don't want this just plain simple
[1:12:08] answer and for me to look right back at
[1:12:10] you and say it's your problem and my
[1:12:12] problem the reason we're here so just
[1:12:17] don't ask me because you know whose
[1:12:18] problem it is it's yours and it's mine
[1:12:21] well if I if we could get them women
[1:12:23] straightened up that's about a 1970
[1:12:26] doctrine but what about it for Jesus
[1:12:36] came the word now listen he came from
[1:12:41] the Eternity 'he's into word form to
[1:12:43] create he come to Melchizedek and
[1:12:49] appeared as with a body spoken into
[1:12:52] existence and spoke out of existence but
[1:12:55] the Alpha knee can eat so it wouldn't
[1:12:57] the often II that was eating it was the
[1:13:00] outside man that God spoke into
[1:13:02] existence was eating so the prophet
[1:13:05] still rise he said but we see no more of
[1:13:07] him because he become Jesus Christ Jesus
[1:13:11] Christ had that fool 1:26 and 27 in his
[1:13:15] possession because he's the only
[1:13:16] possessor of eternal life he's the only
[1:13:19] one that can give eternal life he gave
[1:13:22] Adam eternal life in his soul yeah but
[1:13:27] you just you just yeah you just sound
[1:13:29] like a oneness when I say Jesus I mean
[1:13:33] Jesus Christ I don't mean Jesus the
[1:13:38] flesh I know Jesus the flesh people
[1:13:42] don't like this one really you know that
[1:13:44] brother Alan said Jesus his body had to
[1:13:46] be redeemed why cuz it had a beginning
[1:13:53] not because it was sinful it had a
[1:13:56] beginning it was made eternal in the
[1:14:00] resurrection we'll get down to what's
[1:14:07] the difference between him and you
[1:14:08] but just remember the difference between
[1:14:10] Adam and you you never come in that 1:26
[1:14:13] man into any manifestation into any
[1:14:18] flesh then you'll see that Adam died in
[1:14:24] flesh he never died in his soul he never
[1:14:31] lost that soul he never lost the eternal
[1:14:36] life that God had given him that's God's
[1:14:39] example children why can't you believe
[1:14:42] it the end it what if it depend they
[1:14:46] hadn't have been no sin entered the
[1:14:47] picture well
[1:14:49] hypothetical calls who don't know Willis
[1:14:51] do it I like talking about what would
[1:14:54] happen had seen not entered the picture
[1:14:58] God would have brought us forth and
[1:15:01] taken the 1:26 part of man that we are
[1:15:04] and would have put it into human flesh
[1:15:07] and they were already in the garden a
[1:15:11] tree of life and we could have all got
[1:15:15] together and ate of the tree of life and
[1:15:17] the body would been made eternal and the
[1:15:19] world would have been laid eternal now
[1:15:22] is that not exactly what's happening you
[1:15:28] come into the world you lost your Center
[1:15:30] but you come to Christ Jesus is first
[1:15:33] doctrine Nicodemus you need to be born
[1:15:35] again
[1:15:35] you accept Jesus Christ as your Savior
[1:15:38] that gives you eternal life in your soul
[1:15:40] but it don't change the bodies or
[1:15:42] nothing but we're going as Adam and Eve
[1:15:47] would have been going to eat of the tree
[1:15:49] of life the Tree of Life is the Word of
[1:15:51] God
[1:15:52] this message is the Tree of Life had to
[1:15:59] be no sin we would all went to the Tree
[1:16:01] of Life and been made eternal but that
[1:16:04] would not have given my father the route
[1:16:07] of his attributes that he wanted and
[1:16:09] neither would have given a lot of other
[1:16:11] things so he didn't happen that way
[1:16:16] but what's the difference is happening
[1:16:19] now you're now coming and eating the
[1:16:22] Tree of Life this is the Tree of Life
[1:16:24] the statue of a perfect man you're
[1:16:27] eating the Word of God and your body
[1:16:30] will be made eternal by the words you
[1:16:32] eat may I quote brother branham Easter
[1:16:37] seal you become the word as you receive
[1:16:41] the word coming back to that word body
[1:16:48] that we're supposed to be in what not a
[1:16:51] word body over yonder a word body here
[1:16:55] if you have something over there as
[1:16:58] everybody wants to just remember that
[1:17:00] ain't gonna do you no good it's when you
[1:17:02] match here
[1:17:02] watch over there right when you match
[1:17:06] here what's over there you go over there
[1:17:10] rah
[1:17:11] that's simple he turned a lot Coen
[1:17:15] Brothers Adam received eternal life but
[1:17:20] his body he died you and I come into the
[1:17:27] world lost must be born again he took
[1:17:33] the fact that God would have to become a
[1:17:34] man to die to give his own life I asked
[1:17:41] you a question that crossed my mind ever
[1:17:43] want to go I asked you a question back
[1:17:46] here not too long ago I said you can see
[1:17:52] the spirit of Almighty God in the Old
[1:17:55] Testament and how to anoint a--does
[1:17:57] prophets and those people to do great
[1:18:00] things right you can see back there
[1:18:03] until is even the time or two that you
[1:18:05] can talk about a flesh because milk
[1:18:07] Shaare Zedek was caught into human flesh
[1:18:11] you can father a body but can you follow
[1:18:15] the soul because to be one true and
[1:18:17] living God to be right it's got to be
[1:18:18] father/son the whole to go and it's got
[1:18:20] to be the body spirit and soul can you
[1:18:30] follow the soul of Jesus Christ through
[1:18:32] the Old Testament see that's what I'm
[1:18:37] preaching it is not listening
[1:18:39] you don't paying attention cuz I just
[1:18:42] drop it in level I thought we believe
[1:18:47] the soul was the nature of the Spirit so
[1:18:51] then what are you looking for in the Old
[1:18:52] Testament the nature of Almighty God
[1:18:58] then you can see that nature would
[1:19:01] appear and you wouldn't kill the
[1:19:03] children of Israel because of this
[1:19:05] letter the other you can see the Hebrew
[1:19:07] children and the fourth man in the fire
[1:19:09] you can see all of those things as it
[1:19:12] takes
[1:19:12] you can see that atonement that was made
[1:19:15] is the very soul of Almighty God the
[1:19:19] very nature of God
[1:19:21] remember how he's bringing out the other
[1:19:23] day when job said wouldn't it Joe which
[1:19:25] one went down you know going to Tarsus
[1:19:30] Nineveh you know and he's if you'll read
[1:19:34] that real careful you catch something he
[1:19:36] told he told God he said you were not
[1:19:42] going to destroy them and I knew it and
[1:19:46] you knew it was he sent me down there
[1:19:50] bridge ababil he said you knew it and I
[1:19:55] knew it that you wouldn't don't destroy
[1:19:56] them thinking about the nature of
[1:20:03] listening in thinking we was the other
[1:20:06] day and now when you come down to Sodom
[1:20:10] and Abraham said my lord sit under that
[1:20:16] oak tree got some lease off of it he
[1:20:19] said God he says we can find 50 you
[1:20:25] won't destroy you find 50 won't destroy
[1:20:29] 40 30 20 10 what if he said 5
[1:20:45] it had to end because the story couldn't
[1:20:48] went on any further and I wish you'd
[1:20:53] take my Bible and read my Bible it's the
[1:20:58] Scofield Bible it's not no different
[1:20:59] news but why would you find in that
[1:21:02] chapter they when he's dealing with him
[1:21:06] about 50 its capital L Ord forty is
[1:21:12] capital L Ord dirty twenty when you come
[1:21:18] down to ten it drops to the lowercase
[1:21:26] he's asking because then he knew the
[1:21:32] real man was standing there he starts
[1:21:37] off talking about a god up in heaven
[1:21:38] what's that
[1:21:39] it'll be capital letters but when he
[1:21:41] deals with God on earth it's always in a
[1:21:44] lowercase you know why Coast Guard has
[1:21:47] condescended listening
[1:21:49] God has condescended drop down toward we
[1:21:54] can understand the Lord said unto my
[1:21:57] lord sit down on the right handle I make
[1:22:00] thine enemies thy footstool those things
[1:22:08] means a lot when you look up the meaning
[1:22:11] of a word and it has capitalization to
[1:22:13] it you ever noticed in the book in the
[1:22:17] New Testament the word God has never
[1:22:19] spelled with a higher an uppercase but
[1:22:22] one time he said well it just starts the
[1:22:28] sentence well the Bible says God is the
[1:22:30] spirit and look at your Bible that's the
[1:22:32] lowercase but when he says over in
[1:22:38] Hebrews God who in Sundra times and
[1:22:42] divers matters he's talking about the
[1:22:45] very god of eternity
[1:22:47] he's now dealing with mankind and it
[1:22:50] goes down to verse three and he's spoken
[1:22:53] to us through his son now changes to a
[1:22:57] lowercase
[1:22:59] because he's here remember in your
[1:23:01] reading if you'll think about it when a
[1:23:03] man is praying and the things that
[1:23:05] happening he's talking about Lord it's
[1:23:06] up in the heavens but when he tell him
[1:23:08] to come down the lower case it'll be
[1:23:10] that God right there with him that angel
[1:23:12] I love words I love to think about God's
[1:23:20] Word see you and I came not the way God
[1:23:25] wanted us to come but in his finality
[1:23:28] it'll finish the way he wanted us to
[1:23:30] come what do we got go ahead anybody

[1:24:43] taking place
[1:24:48] you'll find one time when the word Jesus
[1:24:51] is used it's in capitalization the reed
[1:24:58] right on down below it's about two
[1:25:01] verses lower it drops to a lower case
