her kids married she's happy now but she said yesterday she was tired she was tired so we're still going to pray for her I'm holding on Amen I don't care what it circumstances it's just something that a doctor writes down on a piece of paper that's all circumstances is so we're just going to keep praying and good to have Lois and her new husband Lucas with us and this guy was the photographer and I didn't catch your name budy I'm sorry but they call you shorty right I know you've heard that many many hundred times but he was our photographer so if y'all see the pictures of the wedding they're always going to be in an angle no he actually was so gracious to he knelt about the old service taking pictures you know on on a level but good to have you with us today and and listen you're heading back up to Atlanta to go to the airport right to go back to Missouri so we want to pray that the U the brother gets on the plane okay so let's um let's bow our heads thank you Lord for this day Lord we come here in this building this building this morning we bring our lick of fire lord we feel your presence just emanating from each person Lord because we're here expecting something from you not just to be here because it's a event but lord it's a it's a part of our life and as we were yesterday we were in the wedding ceremony we we we just every time we see a bride and groom walk down an aisle we think of you Lord and we go to Revelations 19 where it says the bride has made herself ready his wife we're your wife Lord now I pray that you would just speak to us today for just a few minutes and bless us with your presence you do this speaking father heal the sick be with each one in Jesus name amen we've been talking this part 106 on the son of man we'll just continue we're going to try to get finished maybe about 11:15 so we can take communion and foot washing and uh just remember all these announcements and I'll announce them again this afternoon in the beginning was the word the word was with God and Word was God this is St John 1:1 and that word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us oh sorry sorry for those of you that can't see me being one of them how about that that better okay sorry somebody somebody say something let's just keep going let's just keep going 340% that's good enough and that way the word was made flesh boy can see now and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and what we we beheld his glory what I see his glory today I saw his glory yesterday we had fun with with different ones from different churches that were that were uh gathered together to for the uh for the ceremony and we always you always get together with people you and especially the bride and you get to talking to them they say well you know that yeah I know that guy well I'm K to this one well we're just all one big family in this in the Bride of Jesus Christ you know you start talking about somebody yeah I know that person so that's the way we are we beheld his glory and I see his glory and that's what he's looking at us today he's looking at his glory because we are his glory we are his victory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth second Peter 1 verse5 and this is what we've got the whole the whole point is besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue to Virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance Temperance patience to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity 1 Timothy 3:16 Says and without controversy in other words without don't give me another book right give me the Bible without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest In the Flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on in the world and received up into glory and guess what he came back into me and you so you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word and that word controversy is without dispute it's without quarreling we understand now the total Plan of Redemption because God sent a prophet in the end time and he helped us to see that what was in the mind of God it wasn't a Baptist or a Methodist or a Pentecostal idea or minding your own idea it was a it was not an idea an idea is something you can you can kind of uh uh uh you can dispute an idea but you can't dispute fact the fact is God came himself as a human being gave his life on Calvary died and resur resurrected came back on the day of Pentecost into a group of Believers and he's been doing that ever since and he built his church on that so as he built that church on that man has interjected their own ideas down Through the Ages and as man interjected their ideas it's it's not made the word uh wrong it's made what we thought wrong the word never change the word's never wrong all right amen so now let's go to Romans 8:29 so how how do you know all this is going on how do you know that we're in the right place how do you know that we got the right Bible uh because we we believe there's a God there's a superior being somewhere that knows way more than me and you do all right for whom he did for know so in other words that he had knowledge beforehand that we would be here on Earth and he could predetermine us to be here at this time to be conformed to the image of his son so we've got to be conformed not to the image of the world but the image of his son all right everybody with me am I going too fast Brother Anderson said I might be going a little bit too fast so I'll slow down a little bit okay moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called you got called that's why you're sitting here today there was a call came out that said hey I want you to be my child I want you to be my son I want you to be my daughter and I don't want you just to sit in a Pew and die want to use you amen I want you to be someone that is that is used you a part oh pause I'm sorry okay and whom he called then he also Justified I'm sorry and whom he justified he also glorified so in other words he finished the work he started it so he's going to finish it amen if he started it it's got to be right right so we were talking yesterday a couple of brothers and I we were talking about if it had not been for Grace think about this if it had not been for Grace where would you and I be I mean listen we always think and I'm going to get into this in just a minute but for those of you that are that are that are new maybe uh you look in you look at the world and you see Lord the thing that happened in Texas yesterday and shooting everywhere and so we live in an imperfect world we all know that right but God has commissioned for a group of people to be perfect now if he commissioned a group of people to be perfect he's got to make a way for us to be perfect now perfect is not that I'm going to not miss one word today I'm not going to to misspeak a word I'm not going to interject it's just going to be perfect no that's not perfect is not when you go and get in a car and you go down the road and and ever stop like turns to Green if that happens praise the Lord but but if it don't don't say Lord what's wrong no that's just human beings that's what we were talking about yesterday there is a part of us that's just human we're just human we live in a human body we live in a human world that is imperfect and your body according to flesh is imperfect the Bible tells us that but when Jesus said be therefore perfect he had to make a way for us somewhere in our person in our body our spirit or our soul somewhere we've got to be perfect now if you're born again today by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are perfect in your soul actually you're not perfect you're God and God is perfect okay you're not a second person you are you have a peace or a part of God you have a piece or a part of the ocean if it's just a spoonful same chemicals as what was in the ocean that great big four fifths of the world is covered in water if you've got a teaspoon of it you got all the elements that's in that whole ocean well guess what when you get born again you get that teaspoon or as brother R tells us that little button in your soul that is your light as brother Joe was talking about we the Bible tells us to be the light of the world in this darkness of what this chaos and what's going on it's just by the grace of God that you and I are sitting here today how many of us can sit and testify that that we were this far from dying we were this close for somebody hitting us and killing us or or or or me taking the wrong medicine or me going the wrong direction or everybody if you think back in your life there is at least one time in your life that you're like I am glad that didn't happen or I'm glad I didn't go down that road or I'm glad I didn't do this that or the other right so what was that oh that was just luck no I don't believe in luck right right I don't believe in L I believe in I believe in faith and the Providence of God that give us a time you know gave us a time to do what today make our choice today is the day of salvation they told Moses Moses said choose you this day who you'll serve today that's why today that that I felt in my heart to have all these things we we we're going to have communion in foot washing that's one ordinance water baptism is a very important ordinance I I just felt that maybe somebody wanted to be baptized we baptized 20 of in this church last year and now we got five more so you know praise the Lord for that and and and baptism doesn't save you but buddy I'll tell you what it'll do it'll knock the devil between eyes when he starts talking to you you can say no buddy I died right there I went into the water and I died that old me died and I resurrected new to newness of life and that's what I want us to see not just that water water will never clean you there's no way you can take enough water you can't take that four fist of an ocean and try to clean yourself up but God can take the B baptism of the Holy Ghost he can take fire and clean you up in a split second amen clean your life up oh no he's not going to you're not going to forget what you did you're going to still remember that but you know what that gives why gives you Grace Grace to remember I like the old black sister said I'm not what I not what I was not what I want to be but I'm sure ain't what I used to be all right so we we're changed if we're going to tell everybody's worried about a body change and that's okay I do too especially as we get older right you younger ones are okay with that but us older ones you know I was walking yesterday up those gravel steps and I'm like why do these people keep passing me they're 20 years old and they just jump up there you know Michael misses two rungs of the steps and he just I used to do that not anymore the curses took over a little bit more but we're looking for a body change here now amen we're looking for an inside change here now today we're looking for a body change inside you cuz there's a soul inside of you that's way more different way more different than anything that that you you can't grab this and say I want to make this I want no it's inside of you already today it's inside of you today is the day of your salvation today is the day you make a decision amen today is the day we rededicate oursel as we renew our vows to our spouse let's renew our vows to our real spouse let's review our our vows to the Lord Jesus and tell him say look I've been a little bit dilatory I've been a little bit um standoffish or or pulled away and you know that's what happens in life we all do that we get mad at well I'm praise the Lord I'm sorry you my wife sitting right here you go through battles go ahead don't talk to me go ahead Don't Preach sister don't talk to me I don't don't talk to me right now leave me alone we go through all that right I'm sorry well pray for us we'll be the first one in the alt if y'all ain't having that kind of issue then Lois time coming oh it's already they've only been married three weeks so Lucas we don't yeah Lucas a smileing his face is red so I know there' been some kind of argument going on about some silly something too so usually it's pretty silly you know same way with God it's usually some silly something that you say it's like we all say here you know the first thing when we start getting uh we get a little bit um cold what's the first thing we do instead of diving back into church and diving into the things that we do here you you you dive away from us well that ain't going to help you that's that a separation that's why you don't want to do that you want to get closer and that's why the vow renewal today I hope it brings us closer to our spouse but I saw also hope it takes us closer to the Lord Jesus all right that we do these ordinances and like I said we're human beings though but we can take these ordinances and say say Satan this I'm taking communion today because that's my Lord he give us that commission before he left to do these things and to wash feet and he said if you don't wash feet you don't have no part with me so we got to have foot washing and communion and then water baptism in the Waterway is the light today buried in the precious name of Jesus not in father son Holy Ghost those are titles amen so we know that so anyway so let's get started here for look at for knowledge for knowledge looks back and says that he foresaw this and knows that's the reason he could tell what the end is from the beginning we'll skip through that because listen what God saw God saw that he would write a word that would never change he can't change right like I said before if he loved you before he's going to love you now because he fornew that you would love him but he had to love you first then he loved us enough to follow us down our life before we even got here amen and see our imperfections and see the things that we're going to do and make a perpetuation the Bible says and we'll get to it in a minute about this reconciliation he reconciles us what does that mean that means repair our relationship with God and with our spouse to reconcile is to bring it right back together to what it was before and that's what God's want to do like he did in the Garden of Eden he had perfect harmony with Adam and Eve and and um the first marriage ceremony there God did it the father brought the bride handed it to the groom and said here and Adam say She's Mine she's bone of my bone she's Flesh of My Flesh She's mine now and I can fellowship with her of course the old devil was there too and he heard all that so and he's here today so let's let's don't worry about it but let's just keep on going whether he's here or not we know that God's here amen all right so now he's talking about making a choice we're going to choose you this day now remember we didn't have a choice getting here everybody with me we did not have a choice getting here there's no way you could make yourself get here so you had nothing to do with that that had to be the Providence of God but God for knowing what you would do when you got here it was really easy for him to put your mom and daddy together think how miraculous that was am 15 20,000 little humans went out in conception but only one only one one egg comes down one sperm comes down they connect together here you are and then God give you a soul and he gave you a soul and he's going to let you decide what to do with it he didn't decide you decide what to do with it you have a choice now watch what the prophet of God said but if he made you thus without you having anything to say how much more can he through his brooding give you a choice and you're on the basis of free moral agency everybody here today is on free moral agency you can choose now the children that are below the age of accountability they're covered under the blood of Jesus Christ but when they come to the age of accountability you're a free moral agent and God's going to start judging you at that moment all right so you can turn this down or you can accept it to turn it down is to be lost and remain pot ass calcium and petroleum but to accept it and have a new heart a new spirit and his Spirit part of the logos in you controlling your emotions and when he CS through his word you coup back and answer to him by saying what amen amen what amen am if y'all at the ball game it'd be a lot Lou than that this ought to be your favorite team right here this going to be your favorite team you ought to come you ought to come to this Stadium to watch this ball team take over amen and if he raised him and raised me and brought me to what I am now without having a choice in other words you don't have a choice to get here but now you do have a choice when you get here how much more will he raise us from the dust of the earth after we've made a choice after we've made a choice and he has brewed to us and we brw back to him we love him see that's why that we we we love our spouses as much as we can but love F your love is conditional you should love your wife or or husband unconditionally but you know what there's conditions that every once in a while he sleeps on the couch you sleep in the bedroom what's some of y'all kids looking over at your parents for praise the Lord just look at kids they'll tell you what's going on in the now you got to make a choice that's what God put him here for Jesus said let every man's word be a lie M be truth I wish I'd had my granddaughter first I wouldn't have had my kids now you've got to make up your mind that's my grandbaby back there now you've got to make up your mind you got to make a choice and this may be your last time to make a Choice tomorrow may be too late God might have chose you to eternal life but if you don't make up your mind and accept it somebody else will take your place wow that's the sovereignty of God he knew you wouldn't or he knew you would but youve got to make the choice you're you got to you got to as brother Tom F said you got to trigger your predestination you got to get into it and and say say I accept you Lord and he said yeah I know that's what I saw you know that's what I saw before the foundation of the world that's why you know that's why I brought you here that's why I broed over you you know I broed over everybody but I knew you would accept it same way with all of us now we can skip through this but back part in the back part of God's mind somebody we were talking about something the other day that back part that you know you you see that that's something that you keep your secrets in you keep all your things inside of your brain up in that area all right according to science but what did God do he didn't want to just keep it in there he wanted to release it he wanted to tell us what his mind was cuz man has just scruple this thing up so bad so well the mind of God is the father son Holy Ghost baptism uh the mind of God is is you know we don't have to go to church and the mind of God is we don't have that's not the mind of God the mind of God is what the Bible says and I just believe that and I just believe that by the preaching of the word of God that we see more of the mind of God we enter into the mind of God God and then what happens with excuse me what happens with Adam and Eve when they were in the garden it was perfect harmony until sin took over we know but it was perfect harmony it was a perfect Eden as brother Smiley was preaching last we last weekend but there was a crushing blow camee when Satan got in the picture Three's a Crowd amen if they' have stuck together and stayed together if she had have stayed behind her mate this thing wouldn't happened but you know what God saw that he allowed that to happen he couldn't stop it why wouldn't you say well God could have stopped that no he couldn't he had attributes inside of him that need to be expressed as brother R says right here in order to let himself be expressed as God he's got to be a savior he's a Healer he's a redeemer and without uh something falling they can't redeem it back right First Corinthians 6:9 says know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators idolators adulterers AFF feminite abusers of themselves of mankind thieves Covetous drunkers revilers extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God sounds like we don't have a chance Paul says and such for some of you but you are washed Washed by what Washed by the Water of the word you come in and you listen to the word of God and you listen to to to the to brother rown speak and you listen to God speaks to you that's the most important thing I want God to speak to me it doesn't matter if he speaks through somebody through the prophet or through somebody standing up here but I want God to speak to me all right I want God to speak to me and he will all right if he spoke lip to ear to Moses he ought to be able to speak lip to ear to you and me we're his children and such were some of you but you are washed you're Sanctified justified in the name of the Lord Jesus by the spirit of our God 2 Samuel 22 says God is my strength and power and he maketh my way perfect amen Philippians 2:15 that you may be blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation among whom you shine as lights in the world Genesis 17:1 says when Abram was 90 and N the Lord appeared unto Abram and said unto him I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect remember Abram had a of issues Abram didn't do everything God told him to do but God saw Abram turn into Abraham and he gave him that name because of what he saw he saw Abraham come to a place that he said almost like eeve I mean like Mary said be it unto me according to Thy word he come to a place where he he Abram said hey unless you do something God that's the way I want us to be we come to we all come to that place we come to place say God if you don't step on the scene something's going to happen but but we want something to happen in our life hey there's not a lot of junk happens already we want God to step in and and yesterday when um when when Lauren and and um Jill were were um dancing it just makes you it just makes you see that I hate the devil I hate that demon of cancer I hate that I hate I hate that it's tearing people apart but there's a God that heals amen there's a God that will keep you he'll sustain you you just got to keep holding on he that endureth to the end shall be saved amen we'll read that maybe in just a minute he that endureth you got to endure some of this even as we're we're not going to get to it because it's 11:16 now it's getting close time to close but he gave us Apostles prophets pastors teacher and evangelist for the perfecting of the Saints in other words as we were talking about yesterday perfecting means completely furnished or equipped he he equipped Adam and he equipped Eve and he equipped you and me if we're born again but he equipped them with an ability to be the to be together all right cuz Adam and Eve were literally one person all right DNA wise they were one now you and I as close to our spouse as we are we can't be because of the Fall that's what separated us and we had to come from this mother and father over here and this mother and father over here and be joined together all right but God told him well Jesus told him in the in the New Testament he said what God joined together let no man put us under and we'll talk about that this afternoon but to be perfect is to be completely furnished you and I have been equipped amen with what we need to combat the devil to combat the world world all these things that sometimes we feel like it beat us down God promised to give us the equipment and he did he gave us the Holy Ghost number one to give us guidance then he gave us the word of God that everything resist the devil and he'll flee from you what a powerful little bitty sentence don't you don't have to do anything you don't have to crawl up a wall or do Penance or or you know you know go through a bed of nails resist him say get out of here leave us alone but we got to have patience patience with God to do what he said he' to do and then patience with each other all right so we'll not get to it but let's let's talk about reconciliation just for a minute because he gave us a word of reconciliation to reconcile us back and that's what's happening now then he gave us a message of reconciliation this message that the prophet brought us in the end time is to reconcile us back to the faith of the fathers that was in Jude that was once delivered to the Saints which is this statue of a perfect man or second Peter 1 add to your faith virtuous it's an adding we're adding these things to us and I believe some of us some of us have done that we've added to our faith but you got to know what that virtue is you got to know what that knowledge is that's not have anything to do with the world right you can be the smartest man in the world you know Einstein was a smartest man in the world but if he wasn't bornn again you know where he's going to end up not in heaven smartest man in the world richest man in the world bzo or whoever whoever it is now that's the richest man in the world that's not going to buy him salvation I love the the the the the uh when Jesus comes and tells the parable and tells them says Hey Lazarus the beggar Made It Rich Young Young Ruler didn't he was in hell trying to buy some water with his riches remember he said come and bring and and Lazarus is just laying over there the Bible says in the bosom of Abraham and he's just having a good time amen let's be like a beggar Amen brother Bram said i' tried to have patience 33 years patience women still Bob their hair just the same but have patience just have patience if you ain't got it don't try to build on it see it's not just it's not just having worldly patience you have to have patience that goes beyond what somebody says well just be patient no you got to really be patient I mean real patience like like and I know Regina doesn't mind but Regina's sitting there going well I want Kendrick to be sitting here beside me and I want him to be you know with his wife and and grandbaby and I want him to be praising the Lord have patience I was talking we talking this morning Jim and I were talking there there's a SL slot in time that we got to come to Brother D preached on matching pieces years and years ago there's a slot of time we got to come to that God saw us come to that time and before that it's like brother Brown said there's scrap peaps of ministers and Christians that are that are on laying on the side of the road that tried to make something happen all right now listen though there's a fine line and we'll close right here there's a fine line between laying back and letting something happen and making something happen we don't want to be lazy that's right like I said before if you need a job we'll pray for you get a job but I promise you one thing Jesus is not going to come to your house while you sitting on the couch playing your video games hello somebody and he's going to go hey I got you a job no you're going to go out and you're going to strive and you going to put your best forward and you going to say God help me say have you ever done that God help me say the right thing so that that man will give me a job are that woman amen say Lord even the Bible tells us that if we go before magistrates and judges is what the scripture say don't rehearse your speech that's right that's why sometimes it's best that we don't rehearse our sermons really cuz you want God to speak anyway because listen when he speaks he is exactly 100% correct 100% perfect 100% on spot and you know what if you don't get that job guess what God's knows are the best yeses you'll ever get sometimes but you know what um Michael you know especially being a young man and I was too you think man if I can get this job all right everybody with me just for a minute then we'll then we'll close everybody let's stand our feet come on but I got I I know this is it I feel it cuz it's more money well that ain't what you got to put first you're you're wrong already seek ye first the kingdom of God Lord will that job impact my going to church my worshiping will that job impede me from doing the things I need to do for you first cuz we've seen many times that we've as brother R says we've been train racks scrap heaps of ministers and us on the side of the road but you know what you got to do get up off your can and start over life lesson I'm sorry 175 I guess but these these virtues are to help you be a better Christian though you can be a good person out in the world and die and go to hell you can be a good person and go to church and die and go to hell but you can't have the new birth you can't be born again by the spirit of God and have his soul inside of your soul and go to hell you can't that can't happen ain't going to happen devil they listen there can be seven billion Devils just like that Satan himself if you get born again can't touch you amen can't touch your soul so guess what let's get that let's get that settled get God in your soul not just not just a good feeling or I'm in the message and I'm going to go you know sit in the church and no I want to get born again so that God can speak to me and then what use me use me to do something for somebody else amen I I I don't want to do this job for me I do it for you all ministers do that all ministers are ministers that Minister their what their aid to you not to their s that's right but their aid to you and that's the way God uses us so uh we love you with the love of the Lord um we're we're we're good we're on time what we'll do is after we take communion before we go downstairs we'll let sister Beverly come up and give her a testimony if that's okay just for a few minutes and then we'll go downstairs and do our foot washing and then after that we'll just be dismissed eat your lunch whatever you need to do and then we'll come back here at 2 o'clock is everybody with me just when you get finished going down we'll let her give her testimony sister's going downstairs wash feet We'll Wash feet here we'll close the service out and then we'll just flow right into the to having lunch or whatever you going to do and then we'll get ready at 2:00 we'll come back have singing we'll have I'll I'll exhort just a little bit on vows and and water baptism and stuff and then we'll have that service starting at maybe 2:30 or so if everybody's okay with that and like I said if you need a if you need a flower arrangement or or a bouquet uh Jim's got some beautiful ones down there so let's read First Corinthians now this is an open uh communion anybody we don't refuse communion for anyone because it's up to you to know whether you're eligible or not we don't make you eligible you do all right for I have received of the Lord this is First Corinthians I think he's got it up there for I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you do in remance me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had St saying this cup is the New Testament there had to be a testator die to make a new testament but it's not just a new testament that's written by bulls and goats and Lambs it was a new testament in God's blood his own blood the life that was in that blood is going to come back on the believer and that's what I was talking about today that's what makes you perfect you can't make yourself Perfect all right you'll go crazy trying to make yourself perfect but let God let go just get in the Bible just read your scripture just just listen just listen to the the ministry that that that speaks to you that'll make you perfect established settled script what scripture says do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he comes that's an ordinance that we do every month we we get oursel clean and we get ready to take communion and we do that once a month and that's that's our church every Church Sovereign they do what they want to but we do it every month for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself that's what we want to do everybody examine their yourself don't examine well now if if if brother Tonio get right I'll take no you get right let brother ton worry about him you worry about yourself don't worry about somebody else and don't be looking around I wonder why they ain't taking communion maybe because of you well anyhow but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body what is the Lord's body it's us all right that's what I just said don't worry about somebody else you got your own you got your own Holy Ghost all right or not so you deal with that for this caused many are weak and sickly among you many sleep see if you miss you see what happens all right for if we would judge ourself we should not be judged I want to preach on that maybe one day but not today we got don't have time but when we are judged all right well we judge by the word not by the not by an individual we're judge by the word of God all right but when we are judged we look in the word of God we are chasen by the word of God chasen of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world in other words we won't be judged like the world's being judged but we will be judged as we come here to church and and be Christian wherefore my when you come together to eat t one for another If any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together under condemnation the rest will I set in order when I come we don't want condemnation we want reconciliation all right we want to reconcile everything today we want to reconcile bring everything back to zero reup start over do whatever you want to whatever you want to do today should be the day that you have a chance to do that so just for a moment let's have a silent word of prayer uh praying for uh brother BR said pray for your pastor pray for your church and then pray that we get our hearts right let's bow help us Lord Jesus name we pray amen the Bible said he took bread and blessed it dear heavenly father Lord this bread was made with holy hands it was made the correct way Lord we'll take it tonight and destroy it won't hold it over cuz there'll be new word tomorrow just as there was new Mana in the wilderness father we pray now though that this will go into our body and Lord we'll Remember You Lord how they laid the stripes on your back they tore into your flesh with those catanine tails and they drove Nails in your hands and marred your your wonderful body but Lord you did that so that we wouldn't have one that our body would not be marred Lord when we get a take a change and go over in the Rapture father we'll have a glorious body like you Lord I Thank you for this I ask you to bless it in Jesus name amen could you imagine you know I mean some people I'm sure they were Rebels and in the camp because they weren't they were a mixed multitude and God instructed the Israelites said look I'm going to rain this food down from heaven all right every day every morning you pick it up and on and on Friday you need to pick up twice I'm going to send you double look how gracious the Lord was he didn't make him do without he gave him double but he said don't you pick it up on Saturday which is their Sabbath all right don't pick it up CU if you do you're going to die and there'll be wiggle tails in if you hold it over no don't put it in the fridge don't even put it in the freezer it ain't going to do you any good cuz the word of God is fresh every day you get new revelation every single day amen and and I was reading I believe it was yesterday I think or maybe a little bit before that where brother BR said we live in other words we live and thrive on Revelation that's not an exact quote but it's close enough I know we do because when I get a revelation I live on it um man shall not live by bread alone but by what every Revelation that proceedeth out of the mouth of God dear heavenly father thank you for this wine it's been prepared Lord and it gets better and better with age father just as the word of God and the Holy Ghost stimulates us every day father I pray that you'd bless it Lord and sanctify it to our people in Jesus name amen come morning I walk by the river I'll rest near the Ever Green Tree I'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me sometimes the old world gets a hold of us and rejected but not by God and I question oh Father how long then I take one more at Mount Calvary never forget what Calvary did for us and it gives me the strength to go on come morning I want that's one of the most peaceful songs cuz it's a reality to us brother John there's one day when we're going to cross over we're going to set in green grass that's the softest grass you've ever set on in your life and you're not going to have to get up and be in a hurry to go do this and that and the other you can just sit there and enjoy the breeze no trials no tribulations we know we got to go through a little bit of it here cuz it test us test our patience godliness the Bible says we'll get to sometime maybe next Sunday godliness with contentment that's what that song is to me every time I sing that song it just brings a peace come morning I'll walk by a river I'll rest NE the evergreen tree but I'll carry my cross here but come morning there's glory for me you know Martin Luther went to sleep one night he's going to wake up the next morning what's time and no time over there they'll just go to sleep they just go to sleep and and wake right up come come right back here we'll have a wonderful time listen we can take communion then for three and 1/2 years we'll be able just to shout have fun take communion have the best wine have the have the I say the the wine that's better than the one that when he created in Canaan cuz they said that was good wine best wine he said in the house you know what it was created that wine was created from water water and wine don't mix it just doesn't you love the Lord he's good to us is he he's good to all of us we we bind together bind our hearts together and uh we appreciate all the the brothers and

the Messiah he's pouring water in a bucket and getting ready to wash their feet I'm sure they had a little bit of uh reservation I'm sure we know Peter did but I'm sure the rest of them were thinking that Peter was just one like me he's just one that says it but they're all were like hey wait a minute and Jesus kind of calmed him down he said look he said watch said after that he poured water in the Basin and he was going to wipe the washed your feet wipe him with the towel where with he was GED then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said unto him Lord does thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said what I do thou knowest not now he knew they didn't he knew he he discerned everything that was going on in that room but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter said unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus said if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus said to him he that is wash and he is not saved to wash his feet but is clean everywh and you are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore he said you are not all clean so after he had washed their feet he had taken His Garment was sit down he said unto them know ye what I have done to you asking them a question you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you ought
