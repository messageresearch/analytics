[0:00] can you be
[0:04] seated also I'm teaching Sunday school
[0:06] so be in prayer for
[0:13] me let's see
[0:15] here this is kind of a last minute
[0:17] scripture that I thought of put in here
[0:19] um because I wanted to open with a
[0:20] scripture and so I didn't put in my
[0:23] lesson so y'all can either read along or
[0:25] just listen to me read a little bit out
[0:26] of First Peter 4 it's kind of appr with
[0:30] the
[0:32] lesson 1 Peter
[0:35] 4:3 for the time pass our life may
[0:38] suffice us to have wrought the will of
[0:40] the Gentiles when we walked in
[0:42] lasciviousness lust excess of wine
[0:45] revelings banquetings and abominable
[0:48] idolatries wherein they think it strange
[0:50] that you run not with them to the same
[0:52] excess of right speaking evil of you
[0:55] let's skip on down and above all things
[0:57] this is verse eight Above All Things
[1:00] have fervent charity among
[1:02] yourselves for charity shall cover the
[1:05] multitude of sins and you remember I've
[1:06] been on this lesson
[1:08] of love and talking about love lessons
[1:11] and falling in love with the Lord and
[1:13] and putting you know love in marriage
[1:15] and and that marriage itself is an
[1:17] opportunity to learn these lessons about
[1:19] love but all these other relationships
[1:21] in life teach us something about love
[1:24] filo love but also as being a type of
[1:27] agape
[1:28] love on down verse 12 beloved think it
[1:31] not strange concerning the fiery trial
[1:33] which is to try you as though some
[1:35] strange thing happened unto you but
[1:37] rejoice in as much as you are partakers
[1:38] of Christ's sufferings that when his
[1:40] glory shall be
[1:42] revealed ye may be glad also with
[1:45] exceeding
[1:47] Joy all right I'm going to uh open in
[1:50] prayer for this
[1:52] lesson and I actually have to Sid step a
[1:55] little bit I'm probably not even going
[1:56] to get into the actual love lesson today
[1:58] because something been bearing on my
[1:59] heart that I want want to share doesn't
[2:00] even really tie into the love lesson so
[2:02] I may not even get to that part but it's
[2:05] really uh burdening me so I want to do
[2:07] that okay Heavenly Father we pray you
[2:09] just bless this little lesson Lord and
[2:11] just help me to just calm down and just
[2:13] and just teach it slowly in a way that
[2:14] could be understood and just let it be a
[2:16] blessing to your children I pray and
[2:18] help us to understand more about this
[2:19] Divine Healing and um and the things
[2:21] you've done in our midst Lord in this
[2:23] time of this interval that brother Way's
[2:25] been preaching on Lord we know you're in
[2:26] our midst we know you're doing Mighty
[2:28] things here and and just help us to be
[2:30] awake and alert and see exactly what's
[2:33] happening in this our day we love you
[2:35] and thank you in Jesus name amen so
[2:38] brother Boyd I had an episode here
[2:40] recently of Divine Healing or you could
[2:42] say a miracle I really I would call it a
[2:44] miracle because he testified up here
[2:47] that you know um that God healed him
[2:48] from diabetes and I I've known quite a
[2:52] few people uh I don't know much about
[2:53] diabetes but I've always heard of people
[2:55] being diagnosed with diabetes and it's
[2:57] one of those things that as I understand
[2:58] you're basically stuck with outside of a
[3:01] miracle outside of Divine Healing it's
[3:02] not something that medicine can cure or
[3:04] whatever and so it's a it's an out of
[3:08] the it's an unusual thing for somebody
[3:10] say God deliver me from diabetes but if
[3:13] you um just from my perspective okay I
[3:15] don't know all the little nitty-gritty
[3:17] details specifically about brother Boyd
[3:19] and his situation but I know he's at
[3:21] church all the time and he's always up
[3:23] here his post to dut he always singing
[3:25] praise to God even if he don't feel like
[3:27] it and then besides that he's not not
[3:29] confessing the negative things not
[3:31] always talking about his symptoms and he
[3:33] got up here a while back and read this
[3:35] long diagnosis of problems that he had
[3:37] been diagnosed with and then said now
[3:39] the Lord healed me from all those things
[3:41] and his own wife as I understand didn't
[3:43] even know he had all that so I'm making
[3:45] a point that there's a lot of examples
[3:47] of you that I could name that have done
[3:48] that same thing that you stood and been
[3:50] diagnosed with something you're hurting
[3:52] and you act like you're healed you
[3:53] confess you're healed and you don't talk
[3:55] about the symptoms you don't go around
[3:57] confessing the negative things and
[3:59] that's what I want to emphasize and kind
[4:02] of put and kind of highlight is uh in
[4:04] this little part of this lesson because
[4:07] it goes over look we say Well thank the
[4:09] Lord Brother Bo brother Boyd was
[4:10] delivered from an incurable disease
[4:12] thank God and we go on it then we forget
[4:14] about it but I don't want us to forget
[4:15] about it I want to really put emphasis
[4:17] on that and say that was God and he's
[4:20] not over the sea I mean he is over at
[4:21] these uh other churches the big name
[4:23] preachers the big churches but he's here
[4:25] in Lula and this little church you know
[4:27] and amongst each of you in your lives if
[4:29] you just don't overlook the God in your
[4:31] life and meditate on the things he's
[4:34] done for you and don't belittle these
[4:37] little healings and things that take
[4:39] place Divine Healing is a process it
[4:42] takes time and Faith to uh to keep
[4:44] believing God the new birth is a process
[4:48] it takes time and Faith to keep
[4:49] believing
[4:50] God so we know God hides himself and
[4:54] reveals himself in Simplicity and that's
[4:56] why I'm saying we'll Overlook these
[4:57] little things where God is moving in
[4:59] Lula because Ah that's just brother Boyd
[5:02] ah it's just that's just brother Wade
[5:04] that's just whoever and we're familiar
[5:06] with each other and we'll Overlook the
[5:08] God in your life and I like to look at
[5:09] it like this God's big in my life but I
[5:12] like to know about the God in your life
[5:14] that's why I'm so big about y'all's
[5:15] testimonies even of those little things
[5:17] it seems like where God did something
[5:20] for you and he was in those little
[5:22] things he's always in the little things
[5:23] we leave
[5:26] unlooked so he hides himself and reals
[5:29] himself and simplicity maintain brother
[5:31] boy I was just talking about you by the
[5:33] way maintain a positive confession at
[5:35] all times refrain from a negative
[5:38] confession at all times okay this
[5:41] applies to healing and
[5:43] salvation um a lot of the reasons why
[5:45] I'm saying this is this does tighten to
[5:47] my love lesson in one sense because in
[5:48] my love lessons I've been talking about
[5:51] reading the Bible and praying as a way
[5:52] of falling in love with the Lord and
[5:53] some people might say well I don't feel
[5:55] worthy to read the Bible I don't feel
[5:57] worthy to come to church I've done a lot
[5:58] of bad things that's why I read in First
[6:00] Peter 4 there about the things that we
[6:02] have done in our past we all have that
[6:04] dark past that we're ashamed of and even
[6:07] maybe today still struggle with that
[6:08] root of evil if you're still starting in
[6:10] the early part of your journey in
[6:11] sanctification you still have that root
[6:13] of evil that's normal you're nothing
[6:16] abnormal okay if you go on and and still
[6:19] struggle with sin because you're still
[6:21] starting on as a baby in Christ you've
[6:23] been born by the spirit of God you
[6:25] started your journey you you're
[6:26] believing you've been Justified now you
[6:28] got to go through this sanctification
[6:29] process and in that you're still going
[6:31] to mess up you still might look at
[6:33] pornography you still might cuss you
[6:35] still might drink or smoke don't care
[6:38] I'm an open-minded person I've got a
[6:39] deep dark past too I will not condemn
[6:41] you and if I find out about any of those
[6:43] things that you've done I'm not going to
[6:44] look down on you CU I know what I was I
[6:46] know what I was tempted to do I had a
[6:48] struggle with pornography from 1996 when
[6:51] I gave my heart to the Lord all the way
[6:52] up till 2000 somewhere in there and it
[6:55] was a hard struggle and also profanity
[6:58] so dealing with looking at bad things
[7:00] and and using bad words but I kept going
[7:03] on with God kept believing God and
[7:04] begging God to forgive me and begging
[7:06] God to take it out of me in the Baptist
[7:08] Church where I was at that time I was
[7:10] told you can't help what you do you just
[7:11] plead the blood I was not taught
[7:13] sanctification nonetheless God was
[7:15] faithful to lead me to sanctification I
[7:18] started reading my Bible every day in
[7:19] 200 and sorry in 1999 started reading my
[7:23] Bible every day I was 15 years old and
[7:25] it was about probably 6 months after
[7:28] that when pornography left me forever
[7:31] that's been 24 years I think that
[7:33] Devil's
[7:34] dead if a if something is gone for 24
[7:38] years you can pretty well say it's dead
[7:41] I like when people get up here and
[7:42] testify and say well Lord deliver me
[7:44] from cussing it's been two weeks now I'm
[7:46] like that's good but keep on going I
[7:48] like to hear about somebody that's been
[7:49] delivered for something for a year or
[7:51] two four five years cuz you know you're
[7:53] not suppressing it then it's dead same
[7:56] thing with profanity I said my last cuss
[7:57] word when I was 16 and in um probably I
[8:00] guess it was the year 2000 and haven't
[8:03] you know let haven't slept up since that
[8:05] was not me I had tried to stop I had
[8:06] tried to suppress those things for years
[8:09] leading up to that point from 12 to 15
[8:12] and 16 years old I tried I hated that
[8:14] demon I hated doing those things yet not
[8:17] knowing how to overcome it and I said
[8:18] God there's got to be some
[8:20] way he's so faithful to bring me to a
[8:23] place where I could learn about
[8:24] sanctification but it was already taking
[8:26] place and I didn't know
[8:28] it act like you're healed even when
[8:31] symptoms persist act like you're saved
[8:34] even when Temptations abound and even
[8:36] when you may be fall into those
[8:37] Temptations and when you fall down you
[8:40] get up you brush yourself back off say
[8:41] Lord I'm sorry ask forgiveness for those
[8:43] of you've offended and ask God to
[8:45] forgive you and just keep right on going
[8:47] just don't stop no matter what every
[8:50] time I hear of somebody coming to the
[8:52] Lord I say to them just don't stop I'm
[8:54] glad you came to Lord congratulations
[8:56] welcome now don't ever quit don't ever
[8:59] stop reading your Bible don't ever stop
[9:00] praying and come to church no matter
[9:02] what you do no matter how you sin no
[9:03] matter how you mess up you're not too
[9:04] far gone from God and I sure won't look
[9:07] down on you I know what I
[9:10] was so just to name a few examples
[9:12] brother Dell he's the one that's always
[9:13] been telling us you know make a positive
[9:15] confession you would never hear him talk
[9:17] about what's hurting him in his body he
[9:18] could have terrible back pain you would
[9:20] never hear of it positive confession
[9:22] refraining from a negative confession I
[9:24] said brother boy a w go make an example
[9:26] of him uh sister Monica I remember her
[9:28] mom was she was passing she sister
[9:30] Monica's testimony was always positive
[9:32] her mom passed anyway and I was
[9:34] surprised but then again you look at
[9:36] brother white preached recently that God
[9:38] is Sovereign it's our job to pray and
[9:40] believe and confess all right when
[9:42] somebody dies anyway or goes on it's
[9:45] just the Lord's will but but she kept a
[9:47] positive testimony all the way
[9:48] throughout that so many of these widows
[9:51] here I can make examples of you believe
[9:53] for your husbands they passed and you
[9:55] just kept right on serving the lord kept
[9:56] right on coming to church the very next
[9:58] service I love that
[9:59] I really I really honor y'all I mean
[10:01] y'all are amazing to
[10:07] me um Jesus Christ same yesterday today
[10:10] and forever this is Brother Bam's
[10:11] personal testimony about that terrible
[10:14] stomach problem he have that I think we
[10:16] often forget about how bad our Prophet
[10:18] struggled himself with illness and his
[10:20] little battle he had to overcome he said
[10:23] I had to believe either the doctor or
[10:25] what God said they had doctored me for 2
[10:27] years and done nothing for me sorry
[10:30] about this little part I'm trying to
[10:31] cram a lot in I know you can't really
[10:32] read that but anyway uh he had corn
[10:35] beans and onions he basically he forced
[10:37] himself to eat food he came to the point
[10:38] where he said I don't care if it kills
[10:40] me the doctor said it was going to kill
[10:42] him I want eat solid food I don't care
[10:44] if it kills me and he ate it it came
[10:46] back up he ate swallowed it back down
[10:47] came back up he swallowed it back down
[10:49] people say how you doing he said mom
[10:50] said how you feel I said wonderful went
[10:53] down the street and I was going down the
[10:54] street singing I can I will I do believe
[10:56] I can I will I do believe someone say
[10:58] how you feeling Riv
[10:59] said wonderful I can I will I do believe
[11:02] Jesus heals me now and yet he was regurg
[11:05] you know the stuff the food he had eaten
[11:06] was come back up and you just swallow
[11:08] back down and keep on
[11:09] going that's what you have to do
[11:11] sometimes this is a real needy greedy
[11:13] battle and times it's not supposed to be
[11:15] easy I know it's kind of silly cuz I'm a
[11:18] scrawny little guy but I'll demonstrate
[11:20] for my girls some of my girls are
[11:21] getting to the age now where they're
[11:23] having real battles in life and I'll
[11:24] tell them girls you have to get down
[11:27] like this you know I I I just illustrate
[11:30] it but like a you know football hold or
[11:32] something like you're fixing to just
[11:33] tackle the devil and say come on boy I'm
[11:35] not stopping at nothing and the way you
[11:37] do that there's no physical fighting in
[11:40] it the way you actually carry that out
[11:43] is get up every day read the Bible pray
[11:47] those little foxes that spoil the vine
[11:49] those little things you leave undone are
[11:50] the things that'll spoil your experience
[11:52] you know you get down every day it's not
[11:54] really fighting with the devil it's more
[11:56] like get behind me Satan I want to read
[11:58] the Bible today anyway get behind me say
[12:01] I'm going to pray today anyway I'm going
[12:02] to listen to sermons anyway even I don't
[12:04] feel like it when I was going through
[12:06] depression and lust and um and profanity
[12:10] the devil sit there as a teenager sit on
[12:12] my shoulder and say hypocrite hypocrite
[12:14] i' flick him off and I say shut up I
[12:16] know I am I'm going to read the Bible
[12:18] anyway shut up and I wanted to die I was
[12:22] coming to church here even in like the
[12:24] later on experience 2002 2003 I was
[12:26] depressed and wanted to die constantly
[12:28] want to kill myself come here put on a
[12:31] smile act happy none of y'all knew it
[12:33] and I go home and I want to die and I'd
[12:34] have suicidal thoughts and think of how
[12:36] I'd carry it out and then I'd read the
[12:38] Bible and through my tears sit there and
[12:41] read the Bible that's getting down with
[12:42] the devil and saying come here boy I'm
[12:44] not stopping I won't stop do what you
[12:47] want to do I ain't going to
[12:49] stop so act like you're healed even when
[12:52] you when your symptoms persist right
[12:55] we're on a long journey I might make it
[12:58] just a quick illustration of this if you
[12:59] were going say from California and you
[13:02] had to go all the way to New York it's a
[13:05] long journey but the main point is if
[13:08] you're going to make that long of a trip
[13:10] first of all head in the right direction
[13:12] we're on a journey in life you just in
[13:14] general when you want to head from
[13:16] California to New York Head East if you
[13:19] do nothing else just head east I don't
[13:21] care if you're on foot start walking if
[13:23] you don't have any M of Transportation
[13:24] just walk and maybe you stay faithful in
[13:27] that little walk it seems impossible to
[13:29] get there maybe the Lord will give you a
[13:30] bicycle but you just keep on going now
[13:32] you're riding a bike and you're going
[13:33] across the country it's going to take
[13:35] forever looks like an endless Journey
[13:36] looks like it's impossible for you to
[13:37] get there and yet maybe the Lord if you
[13:40] stay faithful he'll just give you a car
[13:41] one of these days and now you drive
[13:43] maybe he'll give you a GPS and he'll and
[13:45] now you start to hone down your
[13:46] navigation skills and you're getting
[13:48] more and more headed in the right
[13:49] direction and you're getting uh getting
[13:51] picking up the pace accelerating as you
[13:53] go this is just exactly like your
[13:55] Christian Journey you start off so far
[13:58] from God so buried deep in sin such a
[14:01] terrible Dark Life you've lived and yet
[14:03] you say I'm not gonna stop I'm gonna
[14:05] serve Christ for the rest of my life no
[14:08] matter what and I still remember when I
[14:10] was 12 gave my heart to the Lord in the
[14:12] Baptist Church and I said if I live to
[14:14] be 80 I'll be serving Jesus Christ I'm
[14:16] not going to stop no matter what he's
[14:18] the one that's been faithful to come
[14:19] along when I didn't know the message and
[14:22] brought me into the message he gave me
[14:23] my Bible reading at age 15 he inspired
[14:25] me to do that and then the message when
[14:27] I was 17 and every time I needed more
[14:30] for my journey to accelerate my growth
[14:33] he was faithful to put it right there in
[14:34] my path he's always faithful you just
[14:37] keep on the journey keep going keep
[14:39] headed east you know what I'm saying
[14:41] just keep going in the right direction
[14:42] at least we're all in a journey here uh
[14:46] continue on brother B's testimony mama
[14:48] called the doctor she said well he said
[14:50] why it'll kill him as sure as the world
[14:53] then brother said I did in other words I
[14:54] died to my
[14:56] unbelief now I got alive and in faith
[14:59] and now with Christ Jesus that's right
[15:00] he said I weigh 165 lb now but he
[15:03] weighed he said I weighed 118 lbs and
[15:06] take him at his word believe it confess
[15:08] it no matter how you feel believe it
[15:10] anyway he said so Abraham believed God
[15:12] and it was appeared to him for
[15:13] righteousness let's skip on down to
[15:15] paragraph 37 he's the high priest of
[15:17] your confession see they are making
[15:19] intercession your confession what you
[15:21] believe all of you in here that's saved
[15:24] tonight just get in your head that
[15:25] you're not saved and go around saying no
[15:27] I'm I'm I'm not saved no more you're not
[15:30] saved that's a big word for a Baptist
[15:32] isn't it that's true you're backslid
[15:35] whenever you do that that's right I
[15:37] believe you can backslide all right but
[15:39] you see you've got to have your
[15:41] testimony and your confession positive
[15:43] not according to my feelings but
[15:45] according to what he said that's
[15:48] it accept God's Gift then if you accept
[15:50] it on those basis and believe keep
[15:52] saying it over and over say it out loud
[15:55] say it over and over just keep saying it
[15:57] I'm Healed I'm Healed say it until you
[15:59] actually believe it and when you believe
[16:01] it then it's going to take place don't
[16:02] have a negative testimony every time you
[16:04] confess well I still feel bad
[16:07] today I guess you I you go right
[16:11] straight back to the same rut you was in
[16:13] in the beginning okay you'll never live
[16:15] above your
[16:18] confession so this is again getting down
[16:20] to the nitty-gritty fighting with the
[16:21] devil in 2005 I was diagnosed with uler
[16:23] of colitis I simply came up here to the
[16:25] altar whoever was here it was brother
[16:27] Dell I don't remember who was hear that
[16:29] service ministering but I came up and
[16:31] said I'm just having a stomach problem

[16:53] look from 2005 I laid him down right
[16:56] there amen okay now as far as I recall I
[17:00] never went back to the altar no matter
[17:03] it lasted six months that time it was
[17:05] gone for seven years I never thought I'd
[17:07] see that demon again he brought that box
[17:09] of rattles stinks back to my doorstep in
[17:11] 2012 and say I'm I'm back I looked at
[17:15] the package and I said I see it says
[17:17] Dell Bonnet that's my grandpa he died
[17:19] with that same thing says Brook me my
[17:23] sister she's had a Worse episode of it
[17:25] than I've ever had but they don't say
[17:27] Ryan that's that's not my pack package
[17:29] so I I print out a return shipping label
[17:31] and I said and I sent it back to him
[17:33] said you can have that back I want to
[17:36] give it back and paid the actually
[17:38] Christ already paid the return shipping
[17:40] but signed the check said you have that
[17:41] back Satan it's not mine which means I
[17:44] didn't tell anybody I didn't confess I
[17:47] was having a problem again even worse
[17:48] than the last time I didn't confess it
[17:51] didn't say word to anybody Gabby's the
[17:52] only one that knew and there's reasons
[17:54] why she had to know but anyway I didn't
[17:56] tell anybody here kept posi confession
[17:59] and didn't come back to the Altar for
[18:00] prayer he was still right there still
[18:03] dead dead demon dead dumb devil still
[18:06] sitting up here at the altar still dead
[18:08] he just showed up again and I said mm
[18:10] it's not mine so lasted me six months
[18:13] whatever syptoms went away again I said
[18:15] I'm Healed the whole time do you
[18:17] understand I was in agonizing pain at
[18:20] times and at work driving a tractor
[18:21] trailer having to go to the bathroom a
[18:23] dozen times a day you read between the
[18:25] lines there's some humiliation there's
[18:27] some problems that face and yet I said
[18:29] right in the middle of all that I'm
[18:31] Healed that's right thank you Lord for
[18:32] healing me right in the middle of all
[18:34] that that's what brother bam did here he
[18:35] just fought it out that's what brother
[18:36] Dell did so many times just fought it
[18:38] out and that's what a lot of you have
[18:39] done just fought it out just don't stop
[18:42] fighting said I'm saved because I have
[18:45] met the conditions that Jesus Christ
[18:47] required for me I'm saved according to
[18:49] the Bible is that right see and not
[18:52] because I feel like I'm saved and you
[18:54] kept with your confession after a while
[18:55] worked righteousness and all your
[18:56] neighbors and everybody knows you're sa
[18:58] now because you believed it you
[19:00] confessed it see we're talking about
[19:01] healing and salvation back and forth
[19:03] here but why what happened what changed
[19:05] you he's the high priest of your
[19:07] confession sitting at the right hand of
[19:08] the father making good what you're
[19:10] confessing you accept him as your healer
[19:12] renounce your feelings is not by
[19:13] Feelings by faith say you're healed
[19:16] believe you're healed act like you're
[19:17] healed associate with those who believe
[19:18] in healing and God will bring you right
[19:21] out of a perfect and to a perfect
[19:23] soundness of Health he will not fail
[19:25] don't never look at symptoms I think
[19:28] uhhuh
[19:44] yes
[19:57] yeah
[20:02] amen
[20:04] amen if you can hear that she was saying
[20:06] she listened to that sermon this morning
[20:08] and so thank the Lord so this is a part
[20:12] about that I have to interject about um
[20:14] this also ties into my love lesson which
[20:16] I'm not going to get to but maybe next
[20:17] time about being a temporary hypocrite
[20:20] this is me okay this is you when you
[20:22] starting your journey you're a sinner
[20:24] have all your problems and you're coming
[20:26] on a journey like I said
[20:28] to uh a saint okay from a sinner to a
[20:32] saint there's a transition it's not just
[20:34] one time come to the Altar and all of a
[20:36] sudden slam bam thank you ma'am you're a
[20:38] holy Sanctified life and and pure and
[20:41] walking with the Lord no you still have
[20:43] a battle to go through you still have
[20:44] maybe pornography profanity I don't care
[20:46] just keep keep serving Christ with all
[20:48] your heart keep believing keep
[20:49] confessing keep reading the Bible keep
[20:51] praying keep come to church no matter
[20:53] what but you're going to be a temporary
[20:55] hypocrite I don't know how else to word
[20:57] that hypocrisy means the practice of
[20:59] claiming to have moral standards or
[21:01] beliefs you're claiming meaning you're
[21:02] confessing okay you're telling everybody
[21:04] you're a Christian and you're starting
[21:06] to into a new way of life that you
[21:09] haven't come to before so claiming to
[21:10] have moral standard beliefs which one's
[21:12] own behavior does not conform a pretense
[21:15] so in a sense because you're still
[21:16] looking at pornography or still drinking
[21:18] cussing smoking don't care what you're
[21:19] doing maybe using drugs whatever I don't
[21:22] care there's a part of your life that's
[21:24] still having to die that root of evil
[21:26] has to die out okay just keep going or
[21:29] in 20 years if you don't keep going
[21:31] you'll still be right there you'll still
[21:32] have pornography you'll still have
[21:33] profanity you'll still have all those
[21:35] other things 1 Corinthians 6 know ye not
[21:38] that the unrighteous shall not inherit
[21:40] the kingdom of God be you not deceive
[21:41] neither fornicators nor idolators
[21:43] idolators nor adulterers nor feminite
[21:46] nor abusers of themselves mankind nor
[21:47] thieves Covetous drunkers revilers or
[21:50] extortioners shall inherit the kingdom
[21:51] of God and such were some of you we all
[21:53] had our time that in our time past but
[21:56] you are washed sanctified justified in
[21:58] the name of our Lord Jesus by the spirit
[22:01] of our
[22:02] God okay um this is something I'll just
[22:05] kind of skip over this right quick
[22:07] brother bam talked about that Indian
[22:09] Chief and me as a white dog black dog he
[22:11] said how do you get along he said pretty
[22:13] good pretty bad well since me received
[22:15] the Holy Ghost he said there's been two
[22:16] dogs one of them a white a black dog one
[22:18] of them a white dog and they argue all
[22:20] the time the ground of fighting and uh
[22:22] said Chief which one of them wins the
[22:24] fight he said it depends on which one
[22:25] Chief feeds the most you've got got to
[22:28] feed that white dog and starve that
[22:30] black dog to death starve him to death
[22:33] don't feed him nothing he will die but
[22:36] it takes some time there's a dying
[22:38] resist the devil and he will flee Bible
[22:39] didn't say right away resist the devil
[22:41] and he will flee I I would resist him
[22:43] I'd flick him on my shoulder he'd sit
[22:44] right there and linger and I read the
[22:45] Bible anyway he'd say hypocrite
[22:47] hypocrite I didn't read the Bible anyway
[22:49] I'd cry crocodile tears want to die um
[22:51] look at pornography and and use cuss
[22:53] words they sit there and say hypocrite
[22:55] hypocrite say shut up I'm going to read
[22:57] it anyway I'm starving him that's what I
[22:59] was doing he's gone okay um feed the
[23:03] white dog starve the black
[23:05] dog I want to read over my notes to make
[23:07] sure I leave something out so as again I
[23:10] said why I'm talking about all this is
[23:12] because I know so many people feel
[23:13] unworthy to read the Bible and come to
[23:15] church and and you um it's just hard to
[23:17] stay going because of what the devil
[23:18] tells you you are and he might be right
[23:21] and you might be a hypocrite for the
[23:22] moment that's not permanent you're just
[23:25] in a transition and just keep going
[23:29] said I'm also not giving you license to
[23:31] continue in sin that Grace May abound as
[23:33] Paul said I'm not saying just stay right
[23:35] there you know don't just keep you know
[23:37] intentionally you should try to stop
[23:38] looking at pornography try to to abstain
[23:40] from things of evil but at the same time
[23:42] know that you're going to slip up from
[23:44] time to time in that sanctification
[23:45] you're going to slip up don't let that
[23:48] hinder you don't let that be a cause for
[23:49] you to just give up all together Romans
[23:52] 6 what shall we say then shall we
[23:53] continue sin that Grace May abound God
[23:55] forbid how shall we that are dead to sin
[23:56] live any longer there in
[23:59] okay I'm going to see if I can skip on
[24:00] ahead Romans 10 that if Thou shalt
[24:03] confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus
[24:05] and believe in th heart God raised him
[24:06] from the dead Thou shalt be saved with
[24:09] the heart man believeth unto
[24:10] righteousness and with the mouth
[24:11] confession is made unto salvation 1
[24:14] Corinthians 10 there hath no temptation
[24:15] taken you but such as is common to man
[24:18] but God is faithful who will not suffer
[24:19] you to be tempted Beyond which you are
[24:20] able but with the Temptation also make a
[24:22] way of Escape that you can bear it don't
[24:25] let the devil tell you your uh odity
[24:28] you're just you're a little bit too far
[24:30] gone from God you've messed up too much
[24:32] you're doing some sin that's just a
[24:33] little bit out of the way pornography
[24:36] actually opens up this gate it kind of
[24:39] breaks down your walls if you will like
[24:42] a castle it kind of breaks down any kind
[24:44] of fortification you have and lets in
[24:47] all manner of other sick all manner of
[24:49] other perverted Spirits because in the
[24:52] time after the Lord delivered me from it
[24:54] I'd be reading my Bible and I thought i'
[24:55] I'd find all the Terrible Things the
[24:57] children of Israel did and I said I
[24:59] either did that or was tempted to
[25:01] because of pornography it looks so
[25:03] innocent but then it lets in all these
[25:05] other things that just totally just
[25:06] breaks down your character and lets in
[25:09] all kind of things you musicians can go
[25:10] ahead and come
[25:14] please so let's see if that's about it
[25:16] here so it winds up that we have this uh
[25:19] um Armor of God the scripture talks
[25:21] about let having your loins GED about
[25:23] with truth and the breastplate of
[25:24] righteousness and all that it kind of
[25:25] Paints the picture of this great big
[25:27] Warrior but if you want to see The
[25:29] Greatest Warrior that's ever been look
[25:30] at the bottom picture there of Christ in
[25:32] Gethsemane great fighting the greatest
[25:35] battle that's ever fought and dying to
[25:37] the human will and saying father not my
[25:39] will but thy will be done let this cup
[25:40] pass from me my will is that this cup
[25:42] would pass but nevertheless not my will
[25:45] but thy will be done and he gave his
[25:47] himself to the will of the father that's
[25:49] this putting on the whole armor of God
[25:51] that's this toughening up and fighting
[25:52] in the devil it's not really physical
[25:54] fight it's a spiritual fight and it's a
[25:56] it's a mind battle this greatest battle
[25:58] ever fought it's just getting down and
[26:00] reading the Bible every day no matter
[26:01] what come to church every service and
[26:03] listen to sermons as much as you can
[26:06] just keep on this Christian way and
[26:08] doing everything you can for the Lord
[26:10] constantly every moment God bless
[26:13] [Applause]
[26:18] you
