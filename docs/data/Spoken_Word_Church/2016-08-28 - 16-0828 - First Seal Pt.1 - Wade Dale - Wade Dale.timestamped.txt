[0:00] screen I think got it yeah I got I think
[0:02] you hit the screen screen just touch
[0:04] screen too yeah
[0:06] okay all
[0:09] right all
[0:12] right something's
[0:17] wrong hello
[0:25] helloo hello hello hello hello it's
[0:29] doing something what's up working right
[0:34] something it was PR it bad for the way I
[0:38] saw when you take it off when you took
[0:40] it off the thing yeah see testing try it
[0:45] now see I'm not saying anything showing
[0:48] that we're talking real loud right now
[0:51] maybe the
[0:53] F how about
[0:57] now yeah it's picking you up okay all
[1:00] right now Revelation 6 what we're doing
[1:02] is we're going to the seals we kind of
[1:05] background all the way through we talked
[1:07] about uh Revelations
[1:10] 5 we talked about Redemption last Sunday
[1:14] we brought in justification
[1:16] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:19] um and we're not going to get off of
[1:21] that because that's what the seals are
[1:23] the Seals of the revelation of Christ
[1:25] personally to you in your new birth
[1:28] showing you that your justification does
[1:30] not come to an end like we saw Martin
[1:33] Luther's come to an end his
[1:35] justification I hope you understood that
[1:37] his justification come to an end all
[1:39] right his then Wesley's sanctification
[1:42] come to an end but it wasn't an end like
[1:45] an abrupt stop it was a an end that goes
[1:48] so far and then something else laps over
[1:50] and takes
[1:52] over right right stair steps you can't
[1:56] start from the top and build steps
[1:58] because you have to build one on top of
[2:00] the other right the first runner on the
[2:03] step ends but if you don't have that end
[2:05] of that first runner the second runner
[2:08] can't sit on top of it to make the
[2:10] second the board can't set on it to make
[2:12] another one sure it ends but what are
[2:14] you doing you're building
[2:16] on what Martin Luther had we're building
[2:18] on the justification Martin Luther had
[2:20] we're building on the sanctification
[2:21] John Wesley had nobody Through the Ages
[2:24] ever understood that I don't believe
[2:25] until now even up to the Pentecostal
[2:28] Pentecostal said you speak in tongues
[2:29] you got it so what are they doing about
[2:31] justification sanctification it just all
[2:32] went
[2:34] out that wouldn't have been so bad but
[2:36] brother R said they cabbaged down on
[2:37] that and said that's it yeah well it's
[2:40] not
[2:42] it it's just a it was a continuation
[2:45] brother BR said God moved on they
[2:48] stopped right so they stopped and then
[2:50] God moved on so God moved on to just cas
[2:52] San baptis holy ghost coming up
[2:56] through your new
[2:58] birth you're being being justified every
[3:01] time you ask forgiveness of your sins
[3:02] you're being
[3:07] justified yes right right Paul says I
[3:11] Die daily daily
[3:13] sanctification daily right right on up
[3:17] to the New Birth you say well you get
[3:19] the new birth one time right right but
[3:20] you get what many feelings that's right
[3:23] one you birth but many feelings so does
[3:26] it end no it just keeps going because we
[3:30] realized that see I don't think Martin
[3:33] Luther Martin Luther realized that there
[3:36] was something going on but he didn't I
[3:38] don't think he realized his
[3:41] position as well as we understand his
[3:44] position because we're looking back and
[3:46] brother brandham brought all the
[3:47] revelation of what he had and brought it
[3:49] up to date now I love what he said
[3:52] though brother Bram said now if John
[3:54] Wesley or Martin Luther was here tonight
[3:57] sitting in this building listening in
[3:59] other words to him him preach their
[4:01] Revelation would just explode because of
[4:04] what they built on cuz they had the Holy
[4:05] Ghost the Holy Ghost can't deny the word
[4:07] so everything the Holy Ghost
[4:09] says through a prophet or through a
[4:11] preacher or through anybody if you've
[4:13] got the Holy Ghost it's going to build
[4:15] on
[4:16] it right so Martin Luther would be
[4:19] shouting as far as he saw his
[4:21] justification go on to today those who
[4:25] he justified now see he's already
[4:27] glorified right right
[4:30] to me that's what the seal show because
[4:33] look let's just let's just be practical
[4:36] once you first got once you first got
[4:38] saved you wasn't thinking about a
[4:40] glorified
[4:43] body but that's what the Bible
[4:45] says that once you get Justified you
[4:47] need to start looking at your glorified
[4:49] body and there what the Bible says those
[4:51] who is Justified he has Justified you
[4:54] can't justify yourself already those
[4:57] that he has Justified he's already GL
[5:00] glorified he he he he he has already
[5:03] glorified all right so that's the same
[5:04] thing we're going to walk when we walk
[5:06] through these seals I want you to see
[5:08] that your justification is ongoing your
[5:11] sanctification is ongoing yes even this
[5:15] even this Rider brother bandam said he
[5:17] he gets off of one horse and gets on
[5:20] another one he continues right on also
[5:24] but you know why it continues on let's
[5:25] go back to the
[5:27] mirror you know why Satan can incarnate
[5:30] a popee in the end
[5:33] timeus cuz you're God incarnate right in
[5:37] the end time and you're going to be so
[5:39] God incarnate right at the end till your
[5:42] flesh is going to be
[5:44] changed that's right right so Satan's
[5:47] going to see how that happens and he's
[5:49] just going to step right in and he's
[5:50] going to Incarnate a pope and it's going
[5:52] to be the devil incarnate in human flesh
[5:55] that's what he
[5:57] wants that's right all right
[6:02] so and I hate to say this but he does he
[6:06] Satan picks up the mind of God he picks
[6:08] up the things that God's doing and has a
[6:12] plan back in Ezekiel when we saw he thou
[6:16] were perfect what eel 40 somewhere thou
[6:19] were perfect when you were first created
[6:21] You Walked In the Garden of Eden
[6:25] right
[6:27] right so Satan is not way out you under
[6:30] somewhere you know he's he's so close
[6:33] till he can deceive he could deceive the
[6:35] very elect if it were possible but it's
[6:39] not possible so now and we've been
[6:42] talking about the mirror so we we let me
[6:44] review that for some of you good to see
[6:45] Susan back good to see Sister Barbara
[6:47] back good to see Timbo good to see
[6:49] brother Louis and Sister Christine back
[6:52] they've been they've been riding a
[6:55] chariot all over the United States and
[6:59] not been I see so um good to have them
[7:02] all back yeah but we've been talking
[7:04] about the mirror because Timbo see
[7:07] yourself in that is that you no it's
[7:12] not that's not
[7:15] you that's an image of you that's right
[7:19] that only does what you do so that's an
[7:22] image now what we're talking about
[7:24] though you say well now God says we
[7:26] remain in His image well don't you think
[7:27] I know that Genesis 26 but God is able
[7:31] to create an image create a person in
[7:34] His image Satan cannot create so he
[7:38] can't create a person in the image of
[7:42] Satan he has to copy everything that God
[7:46] remember brother Brown said Satan knew
[7:48] the principles of life he knew how to
[7:50] get to Eve when God put them in human
[7:54] flesh he knew they were going to fall
[7:57] because he knew that Satan would jump
[7:59] right into that flesh part of Eve the
[8:02] emotions and all those things like that
[8:04] right okay but you say well we were made
[8:08] in His image that's correct we were
[8:10] made Satan can't make you do anything
[8:14] that's right except what you want to do
[8:16] amen right that's right just like
[8:19] Revelation 61 you got a man with a
[8:23] bow no arrows you got a man that was
[8:26] given
[8:27] Power by a group of people
[8:29] people right and we were talking about
[8:33] the Revelation that even though this is
[8:36] revealed you know brother Randon
[8:38] preached this
[8:40] 1963 the seals were open I believe he
[8:44] opened those seals the lamb opened those
[8:46] seals to brother
[8:47] brandham put light on things that had
[8:50] never Shone
[8:51] before didn't bring a new Bible he just
[8:54] took the same Bible that he had and God
[8:57] revealed things just like Martin Luther
[8:59] I believe when Martin Luther really saw
[9:01] that just shall live by faith and got a
[9:02] revelation from God it became a brand
[9:04] new book to Martin Luther he saw things
[9:09] different just like you talking about
[9:11] the the 31 party the lady with the
[9:12] Trinity they see the Trinity even if you
[9:15] take Scofield which was a wonderful
[9:17] writer he had some you know we think
[9:19] that brother brand came up with
[9:20] theophanies and logos and all in
[9:23] 1906 or 1916 really that version of the
[9:27] Bible was put out in 196 by Dr Scofield
[9:30] he talks about the logos he talks about
[9:32] theophany see so those are not new words
[9:35] but they're looking but you see in here
[9:37] many times that that um Scofield says
[9:40] the Trinity is laced throughout the
[9:42] Bible well see that's all they
[9:44] see they see the three persons of the
[9:47] godhead all the way through the body
[9:50] now
[9:52] that is
[9:54] false but yet that's what they
[9:57] see the Bible had become a brand new
[9:59] book to them right right in that degree
[10:03] and the Bible's not become a brand new
[10:04] book to me and you until it's until it
[10:07] starts being revealed that's right okay
[10:10] that's right I mean when you're a sinner
[10:12] you didn't care that's right really
[10:14] right did you read your Bible when you
[10:15] were a sinner I didn't think
[10:18] so you might have had one that your mama
[10:21] gave you or your daddy gave you or
[10:24] grandma gave you but where was
[10:26] it you know you had to go find it
[10:32] but now do you have to go find your
[10:33] Bible now oh it should be just common so
[10:36] see the Bible's become a brand new book
[10:38] everybody makes that to brother brandham
[10:39] which is true it may a brand new book to
[10:41] him but it shouldn't be a brand new book
[10:43] every time God reveals something to you
[10:45] the Bible should be a brand new book
[10:47] when you really see predestination that
[10:49] it's not just set and
[10:52] dried mhm that you do have something to
[10:54] do with
[10:55] it then you see the you see the book a
[10:58] lot different that's right you don't see
[11:01] a trinity anymore in there do you no you
[11:03] did before what's the difference the
[11:06] Revelation you were brought up into you
[11:08] were caught up John was caught up in
[11:10] Revelations 4:1 to see things all right
[11:13] same thing with you and I that's why I
[11:15] said U last Sunday and I I don't want
[11:18] you to get it wrong I'm I'm ready for
[11:19] the Rapture I'm in Rapture condition
[11:21] right now I didn't say body
[11:23] chain I said
[11:26] right if God comes tomorrow
[11:29] if I'm not ready I'll have to die but
[11:31] I'm coming up first
[11:32] resurrection so what's so what's the
[11:34] problem right if I've got the Holy Ghost
[11:37] if I've got the Holy Ghost if you've got
[11:39] the Holy Ghost you're already raptured
[11:41] you're already caught up sitting in
[11:43] Heavenly
[11:44] places you say well you this that's your
[11:47] problem I don't have a problem I know
[11:50] I'm born again I know I'm going in
[11:52] resurrect I'm going to go on a Rapture
[11:54] so I am in rapturing condition now we
[11:56] but a lot of times if you're not you
[11:58] better
[11:59] see that's a level you got to come to
[12:01] you got to come to a level that
[12:02] everything's
[12:03] settled right right it's like who was y
[12:06] y were talking about a
[12:07] house you know can you come in my house
[12:10] anytime sure enter my house I ain't got
[12:12] to hide something I ain't got to kick
[12:13] something in the closet it may not be
[12:15] the cleanest place in the world but you
[12:16] know what so what you got it all right
[12:19] ain't nothing to do with it all right
[12:21] that's right keep this house clean this
[12:25] is the house you got to clean up you
[12:26] know if if Jesus walk through your front
[12:28] door would you have to go hide stuff
[12:30] yeah a lot of you have to go put
[12:31] television
[12:33] up a lot of you have to go put your um
[12:36] computers
[12:38] up and surely wouldn't let him in the
[12:40] hard
[12:45] drive let me give you a secret he don't
[12:48] need any of that he already
[12:56] knows but if you're born again today
[12:58] you're in R condition I want everybody
[13:00] that's what I told y'all even before
[13:02] brother Dell said it we got to start
[13:04] confessing exactly y'all see last Sunday
[13:07] the Lord's really he's moving on this
[13:09] church for some reason that's right
[13:10] showing
[13:12] us say who you are
[13:16] already it's your confession well I'm
[13:19] not ready for the Rapture well you're
[13:21] not born
[13:25] again am I right CU you want to spend
[13:27] all day in the scripture
[13:29] those who is Justified is already
[13:33] glorified there's therefore now no
[13:37] condemnation I love Romans 8 Romans 8 1
[13:40] through the end of the chapter is just
[13:42] to me it shows a
[13:45] Christian Paul gives you the he gives
[13:48] you the grace of extending the grace of
[13:50] that you're
[13:51] already number one Romans 8:1 those that
[13:55] there's there therefore now no
[13:57] condemnation to them there which in
[13:59] Christ Jesus who walk not after the
[14:01] flesh but after the spirit then you go
[14:03] down and you say if the spirit of him
[14:04] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[14:06] in you that's right he will also Quicken
[14:09] your mortal Body by his spirit that
[14:11] dwells in you so if you got if you got
[14:13] spirit of God inside of you you already
[14:14] got a body change cuz everybody's going
[14:16] to get a body change this born again
[14:18] that's right to me this is what the
[14:20] seals has revealed to me instead of
[14:23] being so
[14:24] narrow-minded like brother BR said one
[14:26] time he said people are so narrow-minded
[14:28] if you put a pencil between her eyes it
[14:30] touch both it touch both
[14:32] eyeballs that's why we you know that's
[14:34] why we're so narrow-minded that we don't
[14:37] let God deal that's right with us right
[14:41] we've sat here for years even us that
[14:43] have the the new birth that are that are
[14:46] I don't know if I'm ready for the
[14:47] Rapture or not
[14:49] baloney if I may say baloney M turkey
[14:54] yeah whatever you want to
[14:56] say really you're in rapturing condition
[15:00] right now if you're born
[15:01] again you're going in the Rapture if
[15:04] you're born again amen
[15:08] yeah let me give you a drastic
[15:11] case the brother the preacher that
[15:13] brother randam knew what was his name
[15:16] the one that bought the bear Ramsey
[15:19] wasn't it Ramsey
[15:21] Ramsey born again
[15:23] Christian let his flesh and his Spirit
[15:26] take him over
[15:29] right went out and got him some beer was
[15:31] going to start drinking brother Brown
[15:32] said 6 months later he was dead why God
[15:36] took him home to not Mar well he was a
[15:38] born again Christian yes and you know
[15:40] what regardless of the person that saw
[15:43] him the last six months of his life said
[15:46] man he must be lost he's drunk he's a
[15:49] preacher he's supposed to do this his
[15:51] confession is wrong he'll be up in the
[15:53] resurrection right he'll get a body
[15:55] changed for you will amen mhm
[15:59] see how narrow minded we get
[16:02] M now we can't fall over into greasy
[16:04] Grace but we can bring it to the we can
[16:06] bring it to the revelation of these
[16:07] seals that shows us true justification
[16:10] right true sanctification true baptism
[16:13] of the Holy Ghost right cuz as we see
[16:16] here we we we John is watching a scene
[16:21] all right and he's watching and then
[16:23] then brother brand picks this up and in
[16:25] all this in this love letter now it
[16:29] doesn't say one thing about a
[16:31] lamb does it
[16:33] anywhere except right
[16:36] there the lamb opened one of the seals
[16:39] now in in the world of of the way we
[16:42] used to think then that's Jesus over
[16:46] there I got
[16:48] that where's the lamb today brother B
[16:52] said the lamb the Holy Ghost same person
[16:56] if you got the Holy Ghost then the lamb
[16:57] is not a over
[16:59] here because listen if the Lamb's over
[17:02] here that white horse rider is right
[17:04] here what you got to do is
[17:07] this right no that's what our problem
[17:10] is and you see in and and I I I'm sorry
[17:14] but in denominational World they have
[17:16] Jesus Jesus over here Jesus doing this
[17:18] Jesus back here in history Jesus that's
[17:21] okay that's a foundation mhm but what
[17:25] about in here that's right that's right
[17:27] right right
[17:29] saw one church yesterday had a had a big
[17:31] sign says this is Holy Ground well no
[17:33] it's not they they had it on the church
[17:36] said this is Holy Ground Church is not
[17:37] Holy Ground that's right the people that
[17:40] go into the church should be the Holy
[17:43] Ground right it's just a building this
[17:45] building is not going in Raptor right
[17:48] right these people are going in rap
[17:49] people are going in Raptor not building
[17:51] all right so let's realize one thing if
[17:54] the lamb brother Brown said the lamb
[17:56] stands here with a book in his hand and
[17:57] there goes the white horse rider we got
[17:58] to look at a
[18:00] separation but now what we're talking
[18:02] about Timbo is the mirror
[18:04] image that's the real person but that's
[18:07] an image inside there That's what Satan
[18:08] is Satan is an image he is not a real
[18:11] person he's not flesh you understand
[18:13] what I'm saying he's not a human he
[18:16] never has been human never will be a
[18:17] human right he's an angel right right
[18:21] right right he can't create so he has no
[18:23] seed to reproduce
[18:25] himself MH he has no way way of
[18:30] overpowering
[18:32] God no way no way of overpowering God I
[18:36] heard something good the other day I'm
[18:37] going to share it with you why don't we
[18:39] quit spending so much time telling God
[18:41] about our problems and spend more time
[18:45] telling our problems about our God
[18:48] yes think about
[18:50] that we go to God say God I got this
[18:53] problem I got this problem why don't you
[18:55] just start telling you problems about
[18:56] the God that's already fixed the problem
[18:58] amen he died on the cross to fix every
[19:01] problem you
[19:02] have anything that's coming up doesn't
[19:05] matter he took every bit of that of
[19:08] Calvin yeah that's why he was a lamb
[19:10] he's a lamb slain before the foundation
[19:11] of the world but he had to be slain down
[19:13] here so you're going to see when we
[19:15] start in these seals it's not going to
[19:16] be some great mystery that you think but
[19:18] it is one of the greatest Mysteries that
[19:19] ever hit the face of this
[19:21] Earth how that God can dwell in
[19:25] flesh I was
[19:27] um um looking at some YouTube videos on
[19:30] uh I never watched the
[19:32] passion uh Passion of Christ and and I
[19:35] may watch it but anyway there was some
[19:36] clips of a song that was being sung and
[19:39] it showed parts of the passion and and I
[19:42] looked at that you said well that's an
[19:43] actor but really Jesus was a human man
[19:47] right features no he he he he bled he he
[19:53] had he had problems and 30 years old you
[19:55] know he may have had more problems than
[19:57] we do because man look at the load that
[19:59] he
[20:00] have the world says you you're not over
[20:02] 50 years old well it wasn't even 30
[20:04] hardly you understand what I'm saying so
[20:08] we sometimes we separate the humanity
[20:10] but let's put it back together because
[20:12] as he's human if God dwelt in him
[20:15] reconciling the world to himself right
[20:17] right then as he became
[20:22] human he became human that we could
[20:25] become God Amen right
[20:28] he became human that we could become God
[20:31] so we see in these seals
[20:33] that we have to see a separation there's
[20:37] always going to be a mirror image
[20:39] there's always going to be because watch
[20:40] you got a white one you got a red one
[20:43] you got a black one and a pale one
[20:46] you've got these riders that are riding
[20:48] but they're not riding out past
[20:51] God everybody get that yes right all
[20:54] right so we're going to start on the
[20:55] first seal a little bit today but we'll
[20:57] get started on it next Sunday so God is
[20:59] riding forth with a true white righteous
[21:03] church that first three Church ages we
[21:05] talked about this before but the first
[21:06] three Church
[21:07] ages zero
[21:10] denomination sure there was little ideas
[21:13] and little sayings remember brother BR
[21:15] talks about sayings Deeds Doctrine and
[21:18] then it become incarnate but God is
[21:20] writing first don't ever forget that you
[21:23] say well brother R never said that does
[21:26] he have
[21:27] to does he have to preach all this and
[21:30] somebody go well boy Satan he's he's
[21:32] doing a lot and God I don't see God in
[21:34] there
[21:35] anywhere God's first anything that Satan
[21:39] does is just a carbon copy and remember
[21:43] the carbon coffee in the garden only
[21:45] changed the text by one
[21:48] word right yeah God said Thou shalt
[21:52] surely die Satan just put not in that
[21:56] very same phrase
[21:59] that was the mirror image but that
[22:00] wasn't see what he does see perverted it
[22:02] from the original that's right to his to
[22:04] this image he added one little thing but
[22:08] the same thing with these seals he he
[22:10] has added something that's the problem
[22:12] with people they think the Seven Seals
[22:14] or polygamy and they they name all these
[22:15] things
[22:16] off no it's Redemption to its highest
[22:21] form yes period amen a mystery of
[22:25] iniquity I told y'all last Sunday
[22:28] you are a product of
[22:31] iniquity born in sin shapen in what
[22:36] iniquity right and we commit iniquity
[22:40] every single
[22:43] day you said well then that don't make
[22:45] you Rapture they got to do with it
[22:47] that's right that's this
[22:50] thing this thing fails every day amen
[22:53] that's
[22:54] right so I don't look at this failure
[22:57] right
[22:58] you know what I look at I look at what
[22:59] he's already
[23:01] done he opened the seal first Satan
[23:04] didn't open up nothing that's right the
[23:06] lamb opened it and what it done it
[23:10] produced
[23:15] twins what it produce in the garden
[23:17] twins what it produce when Jesus came
[23:21] twins whates it produce now twins same
[23:25] thing always going to produce twins
[23:29] and you know what to look at Cain and
[23:30] Abel like brother R said you look at
[23:31] Cain and Abel from the
[23:33] outside you would think Cain did more
[23:36] works for God than able Cain spent a
[23:41] whole year planting crops fertilizing
[23:44] growing the crops making it beautiful
[23:47] and taking it to the Altar and as many
[23:49] people have Illustrated and there's Abel
[23:51] laying up there under a tree not
[23:53] sweating he's he's just Fanning himself
[23:56] and letting the Sheep grow and let the
[23:58] Sheep do their thing and Abel's down
[24:00] there he's probably I mean Kane's
[24:01] probably sweating like crazy and you
[24:03] which one would you
[24:06] pick which one you pick Hey listen Judas
[24:09] was so much so close to Jesus to when
[24:12] Jesus told him who he was told him the
[24:17] one that stops in the bowl is the one
[24:19] that's going to deny me and then Jesus
[24:21] said go do what you're going to do like
[24:23] what brother Brown said he said he
[24:25] thought well he's just going to go pay
[24:26] for them they had no idea that Judas was
[24:29] the the traitor right no idea right
[24:31] that's how close how close it is
[24:35] now but this produced twins right okay
[24:40] the
[24:41] lamb and the Riders the horse riders
[24:44] right got it that's right but they ride
[24:48] so close now watch the only way you're
[24:52] going to see though see now we we know
[24:55] we're a product of iniquity and we know
[24:57] that we commit iniquity every day you
[24:58] say what what is that that's knowing to
[25:00] do better and don't do it or you do
[25:02] something knowing you shouldn't have
[25:03] done it and you did it
[25:05] anyway and I also heard something else
[25:07] the other day and it was a great
[25:09] commentary that Grace God is the only
[25:12] person that could ever create Grace
[25:15] right you and I couldn't do it there's
[25:19] no human way that we can have the grace
[25:21] that God had only God could produce
[25:25] something called Grace good
[25:28] right that's amen amen and you better
[25:31] repete it for everything you do amen
[25:34] amen amen all right but see what do we
[25:37] do though when we were a sinner and we
[25:39] committed sin we just let it run on and
[25:42] what did it do it just heaped up on us
[25:44] right but now as we commit a sin
[25:47] Christians sin every day am quickly we
[25:52] say God I didn't mean to do that forgive
[25:54] me and you ain't got to get out on your
[25:55] KNE see that's what Martin Luther would
[25:57] do
[25:58] let's switch back over to Martin Luther
[25:59] Martin Luther once he did that he would
[26:02] get down on the floor drag yourself
[26:04] across he smack himself with you know
[26:07] lashes and and you know uh not eat for 3
[26:10] or 4 days what trying to do penants
[26:12] trying to make this thing right obey
[26:16] okay but once he got born again he stood
[26:20] up one day I believe and he said hey the
[26:23] just shall live by faith and not by this
[26:27] okay that's right not by this Penance
[26:28] that I do and see that's what turned the
[26:30] world around was people started seeing
[26:33] that and started believing it well same
[26:35] thing with now let's go to the seals the
[26:37] seals have been written in the Bible
[26:39] for500 years written you in letter form
[26:45] right Bible's been here for Bible wasn't
[26:47] here back when uh John wrote this John
[26:50] was writing the Bible right right okay
[26:53] so man has had nothing to study and even
[26:55] when they studied it
[26:58] they were getting things wrong that's
[26:59] right right they were getting things
[27:01] wrong even though they open it and great
[27:02] Scholars they read it and even maybe
[27:05] overjoy reading it the first time right
[27:07] cuz remember the Roman Catholic is is
[27:09] the one the Latin vgate is is where they
[27:11] brought all this together right so the
[27:13] Catholic really had the
[27:16] first um the first writings or the first
[27:20] the first time it was ever put together
[27:22] the Roman Catholic Church was the first
[27:23] on to open it up and read it well boy
[27:25] look what that happened look what
[27:27] happened with that
[27:29] okay but you see now though that God has
[27:32] brought that same
[27:34] book where was the seals where is the
[27:36] seals at it's in the
[27:39] Bible the seals are sealed up in the
[27:42] Bible in a book remember we read in
[27:44] Revelations 5 on the front side and the
[27:47] back seal with Seven Seals All
[27:49] right but now I'm going to ask you one
[27:52] more time and then we're going to read
[27:54] brother R preached this in 1963 this was
[27:57] the opening of the seals
[28:00] right why we still
[28:04] here the spiritual aspect of hasn't been
[28:07] revealed there must be a love letter in
[28:09] here that we haven't read
[28:11] yet there must be a supernal element in
[28:15] these
[28:16] writings cuz see you know what the devil
[28:18] the devil knows that so so so the
[28:21] brothers read it and they go polygamy
[28:23] the brothers read it and they go seven
[28:24] th verses the brothers read it because
[28:26] they have their own Revelation they've
[28:29] never had this
[28:31] happen they never had the lamb stand
[28:33] here and the white horse rider go off
[28:36] because remember even in
[28:38] page on page 109 of the first seal
[28:42] brother R said I made a horrible mistake
[28:44] why he was going to preach the rather
[28:47] with the Holy
[28:48] Ghost okay so that's what he preached
[28:51] before but God corrected him on that
[28:54] what was the correction he could come to
[28:56] the first seal then and say here stands
[28:58] a lamb and there goes something that
[29:01] used to be inside of me not as a not as
[29:04] a not as in his
[29:05] soul not in his soul he's born again he
[29:08] can't touch that soul but it was in his
[29:11] Spirit form Satan had come in and gave
[29:14] him a different slant you say oh who
[29:18] else God cannot contradict his word amen
[29:22] so anything even an idea we have that's
[29:25] off the word of God
[29:27] come from one of them two twins that's
[29:30] right and it don't come from the
[29:31] original
[29:32] one right it can't come from this one he
[29:36] can't come from the lamb he's pure he's
[29:38] the only one that was worthy right
[29:40] that's right so the lamb was the only
[29:42] one that was worthy to what to open the
[29:43] book that's
[29:45] right no Prophet priest king no nobody
[29:49] but the lamb all right Satan can't open
[29:52] it now remember if you'll look we will
[29:54] continue in here brother brandham said
[29:57] he said what' he say he said if I keep
[29:59] it in my
[30:01] heart I think it was on the seventh se
[30:03] he said if I keep it in my heart Satan
[30:05] can't get to
[30:07] it he said but once I speak
[30:10] it see once I speak it Satan can pervert
[30:14] it he said but if I keep it in my
[30:16] heart well see he kept it in his
[30:19] heart but when he revealed these seals
[30:22] he was breaking something forth so that
[30:24] you can say I have hid these things in
[30:27] mind my
[30:28] heart and there goes a
[30:32] spirit riding
[30:35] off he that sat on him had a bow riding
[30:39] away all right now let's read it then
[30:43] everybody time we kind of got when never
[30:44] you never never ever forget
[30:48] Redemption ever don't ever forget
[30:51] Redemption Redemption is in everything
[30:53] predestination every major Doctrine one
[30:56] God water baptism it all has to do with
[30:59] Redemption cuz we were lost
[31:03] yes okay and Redemption does what
[31:06] redeems you back to the position that
[31:09] you rightfully should have had had there
[31:10] not been a fall being a way for it's a
[31:13] religious spirit right that's correct
[31:16] cuz you know there listen and and I
[31:20] don't want to be contrary don't have a
[31:21] quote for this but there was a white
[31:24] righteous Church in the first three
[31:26] churches that's
[31:28] true because if there wasn't you got to
[31:31] watch every time we read this remember
[31:33] there's an original right and there's a
[31:36] copy twins there's an original and a
[31:40] copy this White Horse could not have
[31:41] rode out with somebody on it had there
[31:43] not been a white horse already rode out
[31:46] in the Christian because this is all
[31:51] opposition who opposes and exalted
[31:54] himself we read it last Sunday above all
[31:58] he's trying to be that white righteous
[31:59] Church there was a white righteous
[32:04] Church they didn't have false Doctrine
[32:06] sure it had started starting to creep in
[32:08] but the majority look at your church age
[32:11] chart a lot of white in that first age
[32:14] then it got a little bit more and less
[32:16] but what was white it was the white
[32:17] righteous people right but what happened
[32:21] was they started coming in and we'll get
[32:22] to it next Sunday but let's read these
[32:24] scriptures before we go and then we'll
[32:26] set up bases for the first seal next
[32:28] Sunday and I saw when the lamp open one
[32:30] of the seals and I heard as were the
[32:31] noise of thunder so there was something
[32:34] something what does thunder do gets your
[32:37] attention
[32:39] right it got Paul's attention or Saul it
[32:42] got Saul's attention on the road to
[32:43] Damascus right
[32:46] obviously Jesus was speaking and it
[32:48] thundered he got some attention all
[32:50] right there was a thunder went off out
[32:51] there on Sunset mountain right okay
[32:55] noise noise noise of thunder so what was
[32:59] the
[33:00] Thunder one of the four Beast is come
[33:02] and see when thunder goes off first
[33:05] thing you do is you kind of look around
[33:08] trying to figure out where it come from
[33:10] right but Saul was struck
[33:13] down by lightning and then there was
[33:16] Thunder but now remember brother Brown
[33:19] said the Thunder is the voice of God and
[33:22] the seal break so now what broke to Paul
[33:25] not a seal that broke to Paul but it was
[33:27] a seal that broke the
[33:30] B Saul why do you persecute me
[33:36] right they were together now not to see
[33:39] then you say well you got two Souls no
[33:40] you don't have two
[33:42] Souls see you you see how they get all
[33:46] that see how they get that they say well
[33:48] here stands the lamb and there goes the
[33:49] W they must have both been in there
[33:52] we'll explain that
[33:53] later but Saul was not a white righteous
[33:58] man when God struck him
[34:00] down he was killing Christians almost
[34:03] blasphemed himself I think you realize
[34:06] that had the people kill because of
[34:08] Christianity now that's not a white
[34:11] righteous man okay that's that's this
[34:18] man Saul wasn't doing the killing it was
[34:21] Satan through Saul was doing the killing
[34:24] right but when it thundered
[34:27] God spoke to Saul and there was a
[34:30] separation begun same thing with me and
[34:33] you when God called your name at church
[34:36] or behind a bush or behind a tree or
[34:39] listening to brother brandham there was
[34:41] a thunder and you know
[34:44] what somebody satting beside you didn't
[34:46] hear it wasn't their time you heard it
[34:50] what was it a voice of God speaking to
[34:52] you that's right that's right right it
[34:56] had if you have not had had that
[34:57] experience you say well I've never heard
[34:58] an audible voice well I have but if you
[35:00] Haden heard an audible voice but if
[35:02] something one night changed you and
[35:04] turned you and sent you in a direction
[35:07] that you didn't want to go really but
[35:09] then it became easier and easier then
[35:11] you know that God is drawing you
[35:13] somewhere okay right okay cu the the the
[35:17] literal voice of God is good but but I'd
[35:19] rather hear him speaking out of the word
[35:20] because see because you can hear a voice
[35:22] in your head like Daddy's always said
[35:24] you know you think well God Speak so
[35:27] soft and Satan so no Satan is a
[35:30] deceiver what did Jesus say to Saul Saul
[35:35] why are you persecuting me right I don't
[35:37] believe he said it real soft so all why
[35:40] are you persecuting me right who are you
[35:43] Lord I'm Jesus well that blew his mind
[35:47] that blew his mind I mean really it did
[35:50] it blew his natural mind and what it
[35:52] done though was what did it do it got
[35:54] saw to thinking in his natural brain cuz
[35:58] he never saw Jesus
[36:01] before so what in his natural brain he
[36:04] was going Jesus must be in them people
[36:07] that I'm
[36:08] [Music]
[36:09] persecuting and then that remember
[36:12] Saul's a scholar Saul knew the Old
[36:15] Testament and you know what happened
[36:17] it's just like D's always said and I say
[36:19] I say I say I say you have got to hear
[36:21] the word before you can get born again
[36:22] that's right you have got to hear the
[36:24] word of God you got to have something to
[36:26] to face your salvation on
[36:29] right Saul knew that Old Testament
[36:32] scroll like the back of his hand right
[36:34] and when God came to him I believe
[36:36] scripture just started opening
[36:40] up remember he had his eyes
[36:43] were his eyes were blinded and he had
[36:46] where' he have to
[36:47] go he didn't go down to the
[36:50] Pharisees he didn't go to the Sanhedrin
[36:55] no go God spoke to anas a born again
[36:59] Christian that's right that's right and
[37:01] said you go see Saul and he's like wait
[37:03] a minute
[37:05] Lord this man's killed some of my
[37:08] brothers and my sisters you sure you
[37:10] want me to go down there and lay hands
[37:11] on him but you know what the life comes
[37:15] through the body of Christ the only way
[37:16] and I don't believe listen I don't
[37:18] believe ananas just walked in laid his
[37:20] hands on Paul his eyes open and he
[37:21] walked out I believe he testified to him
[37:24] okay I believe he told him what Jesus
[37:27] Christ meant to him
[37:30] yes you said what it's not in the
[37:34] Bible somebody just didn't walk in lay
[37:36] hands on you and you just automatically
[37:38] received everything did you right there
[37:40] was a testimony there was a testifying
[37:42] how God done something for you right
[37:45] right right if not then maybe you're not
[37:48] in rapturing
[37:50] condition and saw and behold a White
[37:52] Horse He that sing him had a
[37:54] bow so he had something to work
[37:57] with and a crown was given right you'll
[38:02] see them down through here power was
[38:04] given Satan has to be given power or
[38:07] permitted power all
[38:10] right and he went forth conquering and
[38:12] to conquer because remember the white
[38:15] righteous Church didn't kill
[38:17] Satan the real the real church right
[38:21] right didn't have enough strength
[38:24] right read your read your you have a
[38:27] little strength it's in Revelations 3 2
[38:30] and 3 you have a little strength see
[38:33] they had just enough to get three the
[38:36] ages okay that's right just like brother
[38:39] just like the 10 virgins we only got
[38:41] just enough oil we can't give you any
[38:43] you got to go get it somewhere else okay
[38:47] but now I want you I'm going read this
[38:48] one scripture in Matthew for many shall
[38:50] come in my name and say I am Christ and
[38:51] shall
[38:53] deceive
[38:55] many right
[38:57] and I want you to read we got we got to
[38:58] go read 1 Timothy
[39:02] [Music]
[39:06] 4:1 and we'll get into the symbols and
[39:09] all the things about the Seal Seal next
[39:23] Sunday
