Homer some of the Saints and gods here I hadn't saw in a long time but it's a great honor to be here this afternoon praise the Lord and my little testimony is that I love the Lord Jesus amen I was just thinking about how uh brother Branham said one time he said if somebody wrote you a check you know and and you kept that check in your pocket and never did cash it into you know maybe all your life then you found out that it didn't do you any good you know you didn't cash it in but you know I found out that Jesus signed his name on every promise in the Bible amen you know tonight Dave we can just cash that in we can really get a blessing maybe I believe God's Got a Blessing for each one of us in this building today that's right and or if we'll just cash it in today and hear the word of God and believe it that we can have whatever we're in need of and I know God will bless you it's so good to be here praise God I got a little brother Wooten with us he sangs and I asked him would he maybe come up and sing a little song Hey man he's an evangelist and we've learned to love him and been a blessing to us and if you'd like to come up and sing a song that just feel blessing to you

Lord amen it's good to be here with you people today I don't know most of you I've seen some of you around praise the Lord I told him I try woman I guess praise the Lord all alone broken heart trying to calm the Raging battle in my mind I saw a flower blooming where it had no rain no sunshine and are you not that this flower would change the risk of my life my Fast Trip when I was born I found a place to leave a murderer yes he kills me ready you've been searching for your answers but your problems growing worse all the time oh yeah just reach your head in Jesus your body he'll give you strength with your walls he'll give you refuse from the storm a place I found a place foreign ERS but we say one thing to you we always have a kind of a way of doing things here if you're here the first time we welcome you as a visitor okay you ever come back again don't expect to be welcomed because we don't have anything to join we don't have anything to be we're just part of the body of Christ so all around the world we're just one and we say to you that if you've never been here before welcome amen amen come on Tom Cruise Shane up in Sweetwater Tennessee amen well it's good to be back in the house of the Lord amen hallelujah I'm counting on the patience and the brotherly kindness I'm late now I once said even here I think it was I'd never be late again if I had to go a day early well I've got a lot of zeal I was wrong sometimes it don't always work you know I thought I'm going to be very smart man I'm going to buy myself a GPS you know we're going down the highway real good and I thought well we're perfectly aligned with what the GPS is saying but it didn't feel right and all of a sudden the GPS says take your next exit and turn around we went 50 miles out of our way using the GPS before that it was raining so hard we couldn't even see how's this machine just just changed its mind I guess I was wrong so it's not her fault and I guess I'll take the blame though but I'm glad I'm glad because it's not so bad just to say you're wrong you know that makes me wrap your material in this day amen I'm glad this message you know it upset me very bad when something says you have 12 minutes and you'll be there and all sudden it says you got 48 minutes and you'll be there you know I once preached GPS if we could ever forget where we're going and just follow the voice of the GPS we'd make it well I'll hold to that but not the Tom Tom now I'm going to call it the Tom Tom but uh God's GPS will get you there and you don't have to worry the traveling the path you're making just follow the voice of almighty God he will get you there and he's not an electronic voice he is a spiritual voice that will lead and guide the bride to all truth and I've been reading in the Book of Ezekiel and there's a place near the end of Ezekiel where God is hollering at the priests and the Levites he said you Levites have caused all all of Israel to fall into idolatry you have caused Israel to fall apart and and your iniquity is going to remain with you and a little bit later on he goes back to he says but you Levites you cause Israel to fall and you are going to Bear your shame and your iniquity and you think what a horrible thing to be judged by God like that these are the the priests that have done such wrong and then he says then he says but he says you will be in the house of the Lord and you will be in the office of a priesthood and I'm going to have you do this I'm going to have you do this and maybe do this he says but the sons of zadok he says they stayed true the whole while and he says they will be able to draw near unto me you know and I read about that and I thought what a wonderful thing it would be to be a son of zadok in that day amen then you're just reading a couple other little spots in the Bible get to the book of Hebrews even and it says that or it says the blood of bulls and goats could never make the worshiper perched it could never clear the conscience and I thought no I don't want to be in the days of zadok I want to be in this day because if I had to type myself to anybody it'd be the Levites I spent 28 years of my life messing everything up I could I'm so glad for the message of the hour but you know those priests could go back and they could never find a conscience clearing sin killing method to to lead and guide them along the way although they live straight and they live clean how is so is it in this day so many straight Living Clean living people caught in doctrines of three Gods caught in doctrines of all sorts of false things and here we have the truth and here we had a high priest step to the throne of Mercy for us to go up calvary's hill with our sins on his back to carry all of our you know I'm so glad uh Isaiah says he bore my shame in my iniquity because I don't have to bear my iniquity he bore my iniquity he Bears our shame and this message is a superior way it is a higher level of knowing god it is a more personal relationship with Jesus Christ it is the it is the Fulfillment of God's Mysteries that he wanted to bring to a people and he's brought that people to such a place they oh they can live with taking a wrong turn or they can live with falling even because they're able to get back up that is the strength of this message we can get back up when we fall and I'm so glad of that and I can't wait to hear the preaching the church is doing real good in Sweet Water and uh my children I'm just a first-time parent they went and grew up on me they're working today they've got a little vegetable stand and one wasn't good enough now they got two little vegetable stands they got themselves a little Ministry they're earning their weights or church camps and and getting other people through the church camps and they knew they knew a young man years ago his name is Kyler and uh he was some kind of oh like a soft Baptist good kid though a good straight living kid and his dad wrote a book one time and I remember reading it and it was a terrible book and at the end of it it even said that Jerusalem was the seat of the Antichrist mystery Babylon I looked at that and my family says well what do you think of this book so just got a nice cover get a pretty cover you know what I ended up that Kyler's Mom and Dad split up and she's off in South Carolina he's off I don't even know where he's at and he's supposed to be a pastor and she's supposed to be a pastor's wife and a minister and uh Port Kyler and I always hat sideways I guess that's what happens when boys parents split up their hats turned sideways and he's got a bunch of holes in his ears I guess you start leaking and he is just in such a mess but he loves my children and my children and his people are not the same Doctrine but you know they've invited them to brother Burley Williams can't he says you know I think I'd like to do that so they sent him the form you know no shorts no this no that and you know you got to be you got to be clean cut before you you know approach God or in the Canton he read that for him and he said back says I'll go so we're really helping and part of the Farm Brother Burley says would you be against being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he's put no so uh be praying for the children they wanted to be here they send your greetings and uh let's pray one for another I don't know what's going to happen next but it's exciting you know a little group of Christians went up to the uh to the courthouse in Washington DC to the Supreme Court House and they looked at it and right before they left they said we're going to pray on the steps of the courthouse did anybody hear about this they gotta stop a policeman rushman says you can't do that here you've got to leave right right now amen and just that's just like the other man in North Carolina or South Carolina uh Judiciary System he ended his prayer with the name of Jesus and they fired him so it's getting closer and closer amen nothing should surprise us the message said it would fall all apart this is all falling exactly right into program our country's now so broke financially spiritually it's in a mascot everything's falling into line just perfectly I'm glad to be right in the center of it amen and I believe we're going to make it I want to say one more thing I'm sorry for taking so much time I'm glad for the leadership of the message of the hour I'm glad for the fivefold menstrual I really appreciate my older brothers in the message you know they've been a comfort to me even when I don't see them when things go tough in a local church I just think wow brother Homer would get me laughing about her brother Samuel Dale will get me feeling better about it brother page it'll get me feeling good about it and I think all the older brothers brother Tony ubola he'll he'll have a leading for me and you know different ones around the message of the hour and it strengthened me through the years and I just want to say thank you and I thought I just need to see you way Dale or I I need to see you know sister Kay or somebody and so that's why we're here today even if it took five hours but God bless you all my singers are selling vegetables but we love you thank you we'll start over this way see I don't know this brother here so he's shaking his head so he must not be a pastor okay oh brother Tony okay all right as long as we don't miss anybody we don't want to do that because you know like really uh Tom was saying you know you follow that GPS that's made by man you can always have a mistaking amen we were way down in a place where we're checking out deer hunting one day and son-in-law he said I got a GPS and I said I gotta accomplish an accomplice with an agreeing with the GPS which you know that if you know anything and later while we started to leave and it started getting dark I said well we got to follow this GPS I said you can follow that GPS all you want to I'm not going to follow you and I said what are you going to do I said I'm going right up through here I said yeah with the GPS said we got to go that way I said go where you want to I'll see you before we even so I start plowing through the rough undergrowth and look back behind him and I was waiting some of them all falling right along behind me you know what we walked out right up to the four wheeler got only come on so you can't trust everything man makes that's right they only trust God and he'll do it brother Padgett come on you're right up here in Blue Ridge next to mckaysville Michigan amen praise the Lord everybody amen you know what makes my back lock up that makes third time it's locked up on me like that so but I'm got to get my new one yeah amen praise the Lord amen I think about that GPS and we got one in two brother and uh uh we went to a funeral my uncle passed away about a year ago and it was telling us go to the right and we took off down the road this kid and we went about four or five miles I told him why I said I don't feel right GPS kept going that way and I said I don't think this is right we better turn around and she said no I don't need this so you know sometimes your god-given instinct is a whole lot better yeah amen Amen brother I like the way God puts things in amen but amen enough Instinct in an animal that don't need a GPS but it knows exactly where it can go that's right I said Thank You Lord amen he let me write to the Fountain of Living Water took me to the bread of life I could feed daily and drink all I want enjoy the blessings of God oh I tell you what I love him today church amen and y'all found out one thing a long time ago you cannot love God if you can't love your brothers that's right amen that's right we may disagree a lot of times don't blame but if you can't love them brother Graham said nothing will get there but perfect love and we don't get there to get it wait a minute yeah I want to say the church looks good amen's done good I don't know who done it but it sure does look good hey man we're going to move out of the way uh we got a little uh Church up in McCaysville almost in the North End Of Georgia almost on the Tennessee Border up there yeah we really all of our love and our ingredients from all the saints and it's good to see all I mean even there are Spanish folks here it's good to see them today amen amen oh brother Eugene the sister gentleman I believe they have a song for us today God bless all agents we love every one of you praise the Lord amen okay okay foreign a hard time with coughing and taking on and a little bit of an earache so Lord bless you can help me with this we'll we'll sing Sinners Hall of Shame he spoke all so softly but my ears refused to hear he knew of my lonely he knew of everything I was searching for I knew not what I've seen in sorrow it's all I got the deeper I'd sing the more I think looking for me foreign his blood has washed my name from the wall of the sinner's Hall of Shame less I took his name he took my blame now my life won't ever be the same cause he removed my name from the wall of the sinners I was guilty but no one to take the blame until I cry dear Jesus his blood has washed my name from the wall of the sinners wonderful is your name been washed from there it needs to be cleaned yeah yeah no sign but he is is that the way you say it come on I told a brother today I can't remember names I'm sorry I just can't remember tonight but sometimes I can put them in place and this brother has one I can remember his name's Samuel God bless approach it's our privilege to be a In The House of the law with you here amen uh yesterday I never spoke an English I'm public but uh I can feel the spirit of God then is the Same Spirit spoken about the GPS and uh well we have a better technology than the men yeah is that technology of God and is the holy spirit amen amen and it doesn't matter which language what doesn't matter which color so we have the same spirit in this case to have it so my name is Samuel Reyes uh um I'm under the minister of a brother Gabriel Villalobos or pastor and uh for me it's a privilege to to serve garden and and this place right yes but uh I'm feeling small when my pastor is when it is here so um God bless everybody and I hope we can have a good time tonight and ah we love everybody in the love of Jesus Christ foreign we had a wonderful time last year we invited to or uh brother Gabriel and then we're having a meeting where the Samuel name in Gainesville we had a wonderful opportunity to be able to go up and fellowship with them and you know and had a wonderful time fellowshipping and all and I told them the only thing that it didn't matter how they spelled it what it is I still don't like guacamole's we had a good time they they took my Southern attitude and out and the Spanish and tried to put I mean a language and tried to put it into Spanish now I don't know what they they said I see it but it's just hard to understand me anyway but we appreciate all that all right well looking back we have one more so we say it's the best of Life brother Gabriel come on and speak to the people and greet them his brother is from The Windy City of Chicago so we appreciate him coming down amen God bless you man well it's also a great privilege for me to be here in these meetings I just found out yesterday that you were having some fellowship meetings so I said well let's go and meet with the brothers it's always a pleasure to meet some of the people that we have not been able to meet before amen and since we are scatter all over it's always a privilege to meet you and others for the first time even though we know that we are family because uh the brother said brother they'll say you're a visitor you know if this is the first time I've been you are a visitor but I never feel like a visitor you know wherever I go I just feel part of the family because if you're not willing to feel or able to feel as part of the family then you're not part of the family that's right that's right so but since we know that we are one family then I don't feel no stranger you know amen so it's great it's great it's great to be here with you and uh to see some of the faces for the first time and I hope it's not going to be the the only time so I come often actually here to uh Atlanta or to Gainesville to be with the brothers a few times a few years we started a little work in the Atlanta area we have some family you know that took the message they believed the message so we had to send somebody from our church in Chicago so that they can be with them and help them you know they'll always have somebody to to start a church you know because the people need somebody they're by their side so we started the work since we usually do missionary work in different places you know I've been kind of all over um I spent some time in Chicago it's been been the pastor in Chicago and some of the time being outside you know like this summer I haven't been too much in in in the area in Chicago too much outside so but then some of these people in Gainesville like the family the Reyes family came into the message we decided to move from Atlanta to Gainesville to be the side of the the state but we ended up you know having a little group staying there you know in in the area of Atlanta for the people that's over there that are more comfortable being there so we decided to move it over here and be in Gainesville very close to Lula Georgia so anyways we just work this way and trying to do any thing that we can to help anybody we still find one seat here and one seat there you know still willing to hear the message of the hours and you get surprised sometimes we think that there is nobody else but still you find some here and wonderful we're still doing whatever we can so it's a great privilege and uh what I want to say just like brother uh Samuel said we don't have no singers with us so you're going to have to forgive us and we have some singers actually but I'm not sure if they're prepared though let's see I don't know I'm saying in Spanish because they didn't prepare anything we just found that up at the services yesterday but I know that we're at home and if they want to sing in Spanish I I think you don't mind I mean you know when I I heard the brother singing back there it says man you know he's singing so I should sing something myself you know laughs I'm kind of a young and I said that I cannot sing I mean we can sing something so I don't know maybe one of the sisters sister you might want to sing a little a little something a little chorus or something don't you know since okay okay she is not prepared but we are prepared because we need to get prepared you know this is our base preparation unfortunately I'm not a singer otherwise I will sing something though but sometimes I sing it in church and I suppose they sang before they can sing at least a little chorus so we're gonna let it come and man just say sing something doesn't matter yeah amen amen hallelujah foreign deals this time again dinosaurs foreign I believe say happy again foreign thank you foreign have we missed anybody whoa is there any other pasture in here that we haven't recognized this talks to somebody's supposed to sing from here so don't ask me if they're supposed to have done brother Joe you should get out here and get and they're they're supposed to get everything together and have a little singing for you and kind of a quartet but uh right we don't know where they're at because they're scattered all over the place but while they're coming I guess you wander up at the front of here while you're looking at what most people think is two pictures of Hoffman's head of Christ you know but if you'll come up later and pay close attention you will see the difference yes Hoffman painted a picture of what he thought Christ looked like and you know right around said he thought Hoffman was the best picture of all of them and that's fine I just think it's a beautiful picture but the story is that he painted a picture well then some years later he went back and he painted another picture most people don't know that story he painted one of the Lord Jesus at what he thought he looked like at 30 years of age then he painted one of what he thought he looked like it 33 years of age all right even according to the artist you know the people who that know they said he had developed greater in his ability to

now yes yes Nord for the success of these meetings yes be with us Master we pray as we read your word amen Saint John chapter 1 and verse 1 that which was from the beginning which we have heard Saint John Saint John I I said Saint John uh first John first John the epistle okay right next to Revelation and Jude so far that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word Capital Rd Word of Life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and so unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye Also may have Fellowship with us yes you love Fellowship amen and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ and these things right we unto you that your joy may be full how many believe the message amen this there is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light amen and in him there's no Darkness at all yes and we say if we say if we say that were in the message if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we laugh yes and do not the truth yes but if we walk in the light as he is in the light yeah amen we have Fellowship one with another yes and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin amen God bless you may be seated the phone my appreciate your prayers and the fine atmosphere that's been created here and certainly All God's Children are creators is that right you have the privilege of creating an atmosphere to make the great Creator welcome Glory and fellowship does that some get to see all these different ministers and so forth I better not get started calling names because I'm getting uh I need all the uh I'm sure I'll probably miss somebody yeah relationship yes and I want you to realize tonight remind you I'm sure as Believers you know this but I'm just here to kind of stir up your pure Minds by way of remembrance okay and I want to try to do that I believe the holy spirit is able to bring these things to our remembrance we don't come with anything new but we want to just uh jog your memory and um uh emphasize the importance of Fellowship right amen true Godly fellowship and everybody else um was I've got my wife here and I want her to stand up I fail to recognize her sometimes would you stand up sweetheart she's also God Bless you that's my uh I told the sisters in the back I ran away from church with my piano player and that's her right there she plays the piano so we had to get somebody else to fill in for her this week but uh I'm sure glad that she came with me oh my you know what that GPS really is that's God's predestinated seed inside you as long as you got that GPS you'll be all right y'all please forgive me I got I already apologized to brother Samuel here and a brother Wade uh and I'll have to say that uh I don't know if anybody else came in after brother Tom or not brother Christian but I did just barely beat him here so if you're gonna give him Grace you're gonna give me Grace too all right come in just a little bit before he did I was about 15 minutes late just only that's a quarter of a hour they're docking me for my likeness but uh I um just take it down the offering brother oh innocent the Lord good to us but uh I'm really glad to have my wife with me and we've got two preachers to cover home base and my song leader is going to be there my Deacon's gonna be there and we got a special piano player coming in tomorrow and everything's just all right we come here just to let off their pressure and help fellowship and I just feel good about being here amen just feel real good about being here so now let's just concentrate and set our hearts and affections on things above we've got to know one another we've expressed our uh selves and uh brother I'm not no longer it's not necessary to make me welcome because I've been here before I've been behind the pulpit here before and I appreciate the privilege for the day of real my to me one of the greatest um commendations that you could give to a man or honors would be to give him your pulpit and then for a man to take advantage of that or abuse that to me that'd be one of the most terrible things a man could do too yeah amen and so I highly regard the position here of being behind this sacred desk and God bless this assembly now the importance of Fellowship really understood and and by the grace of God today we'll go out with a greater understanding than when we came in amen but we'll see and I believe this is going to what y'all are doing the efforts for the day when you're putting forth here and and The Minister's meetings brother Calhoun and the different things you know Fellowship has to start from the top down that's right God is the author of Fellowship amen amen God is the author of Fellowship oh my amen yes now just think about the scripture we just read for a moment the blood of Jesus Christ is not even efficacious it's no longer effective to you or to me that blood is absolutely no and void and of no use whatsoever I don't the Bible says if we walk in the light then we will have Fellowship one with another and then and then only does the blood cleanse us all sin amen if you're walking in the light as he's in the light you're going to have fellowship with light right amen says we should not have fellowship with Devils right that's right cannot fellowship with Darkness amen if you say that you're walking in the light and you fellowship and with Darkness you're not in the truth you're lying amen amen is that okay yes yes holy my the purpose God's Great purpose in the message knoweth that not the prophet said God's whole purpose was the church right yes and the church age book he said in order to give himself a purpose and a reason in existence of being he had to predestivate a church that would need Redemption amen amen think about how much God loves you how much fellowship with you yes that's right he had no purpose and existence apart from you right amen hearing that our Prophet tried to commit suicide don't you know that was only reflecting something that God what is reflecting yes God had no purpose of existence wow did he want to commit suicide he tried to do it ain't no beating around the bush about it he tried to take his life amen the gun wouldn't go off right that's right until he throwed it down and then it went off is that right his hardest God you wouldn't let me kill myself you wouldn't let me take my life what had happened he had lost his family his wife his daughter yes God in order to give himself a purpose and a reason for being had the predestinated family A people that would need Redemption God's got some attributes it's got to be made manifest and one of those attributes is fellowship yeah Amen brother Longoria haven't you like to be the only one in the universe you're right are the great universities of Eternity yes I heard brother Collins earlier how would you like to be the only one think about it sister think about it brother old or young How would how would you like to be the self-existing one yeah it did Lonesome you're gonna be wanting some fellowship yes sir hi I don't think we appreciate Fellowship like we should amen amen that's right we need to appreciate one another amen thank you brother Beckett over there in South Africa we've had him over a few times and I'd say well brother making sure you don't know how I appreciate you he said well I appreciate nine you I'm more to hate you I denying you I believe we need to really appreciate one another don't you yeah really recognize what is it there's God in one another yeah when you recognize it's God seed having fellowship with God amen amen amen I feel good good good I feel good good good every time I think about Jesus I feel good good good good good you pray for me I'll pray for you that is the way God's Pride will do he didn't know I was going to sing for you did you oh my God you all really got a good thing going here amen I'm just glad to be part of it amen Fellowship God he was just recently listened to a message the order of our services back home we have four Services a week normally we'll have our Sunday morning service at 10 and 5 and Sunday evening at five then on winch that we have our prayer meeting preaching and praying and so forth then on every Friday night we'll play a tape we have a big screen we pull down we have the continued text and you get a double exposure you hear the voice of God you see the words oh my and we just played about a third of who is this melchistic oh my God and the prophet of God said something on there I'd never heard him say before I hadn't heard the text before now okay you hear it but hearing we hear it off sometimes that's right but in there he said you know the whole purpose of God now I'm paraphrasing you'll have to go get it yourself you know when you paraphrase something at least it'll create a little incentive for you go check it out okay quit your appetite but I don't have the quote before me but he said something on this order he said that was the reason that God created man in the first place was for Fellowship amen amen and in the first place was for Fellowship oh how sweet and how pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell together and unity oh it's like the annoying oil it was poured upon the head of Aaron ran down on his spirit and even to the skirts of his garbage yes oh he got a baptism of love and fellowship and unity that's what we need amen when we get a baptism of love the church can go forward half the Little Women in the East for the tavern around their head to show they were married and remember how Jesus talked about what lost the coin outward Cameron her husband has gone away kind of like ours has kind of you you know and oh it was time for him to return all right yeah and she had a coin missing yes and was one of those coins missing and he founded her in that state right they screaming now forget some God bless you listen what if their her husband catch her there with one of those coins missing out of her Temperance like a wedding ring you know right that was the side they take that out when she committed adultery yeah yeah right or being untrue and so that was a sign of something that was unfaithful right amen and all she got concerned because her husband she knew it was time for him to return amen it is time for him to return all right Church find that missing coin brother she started sweeping yes oh my we used to rent and our landlord was a Episcopalian and he didn't make any bones about it he said I call him whiskey pillions because before you find four of them you'll find the fifth and uh well he talked also about how that they was talking about Moe's went to the altar in the Presbyterian Church and he got up there and he prayed the same prayer every night oh Lord bring your gospel broom down sweep these cobwebs out of the out of the balcony of my soul he prayed that same prayer the altar every night so finally the the person came down and said Moses you're praying the wrong way you said what you mean person he said well you need to pray like this most said you need to pray and say Lord God come down from your great bowel condition in heaven down into the balconies of my soul take your gospel broom and kill that spider what these calls and all them come with us I don't care how you define it why don't you call it we must be born again when you get born again you're going to own a fellowship with those who are born again oh yes sir you don't want to draw a circle and draw somebody out you want to draw a circle and draw them back here amen that's right amen all right hold me and my foreign kind of like the old Quaker you know he said I believe it's just me and you hun talking to his wife said it's going to be saved just me and thee and sometimes I wonder about these all right he thought he's on one don't be safe well we get two seclusive sometimes that's right that's right truth you remember they told brother Ben what if you're gonna go over and preach for them to encourage you can't come over here and pre-trust Oneness or vice versa that's right he said well God's call me well I'll tell you what brother man if you're gonna preach for them we don't just draw a circle and we'll draw you out of our fellowship he said well I'll just draw a bigger Circle and draw you right back in amen amen amen is that right amen amen yes sir all right that's right amen can we have that attitude come on yes amen oh wait A lot of times we say well yeah if you're going to throw me out of your circle that's gone I'll do something better for you I'm bless you I don't you're not sure I have dirty laundry on the internet about you and I've seen it all over the country that ain't the spirit of Christ amen that's not the spirit of Christ amen is that right oh my God we need love we need Fellowship yes yes my God I added a little bit to that y'all forgive me if you get me for adding to the word but I I thought you know it's not only Two Fellas in the same ship but they're both paddling the same direction One Direction paddling in that direction and the other one in the other end paddling the other direction but they're in unity so the problem is we're disunified together that's right right that's right they're just giving a five together I just feel good y'all forgive me don't accuse me going off and play in the drums but listen to me do you know what listen to me you can take two old Tomcats tie their tails together and you got Union all right hang them over a clothesline you ain't gonna have much Unity you gotta fight right amen amen talking about it's not for time it's for Eagles they'll learn out their differences oh yeah it's good for you rub up against one another not only does iron sharpen iron but diamonds polished Diamonds oh you say that brother mind he just irritates me I can't stand him go listen to message Blasphemous names amen if you can't get Beyond brotherly kindness you'll never get it on that one up to perfect love that's right Prophet said brotherly kindness in the Statue of a perfect man he said he's putting up with one another yeah learning to put up with one another that's right and you know if you'd put up with one another long enough you you learn after a while she's kind of like your wife you know or your husband After Fall it'll be where you just realize hey you can't do that one another and I believe that's the way we gotta come amen I just need one another or loving one another putting up with one another but we need to be the place to where we realize we gotta have one enough thank you Glory nothing on you of Godly Fellowship yes and the purpose the purpose of Fellowship is to bring us to a relationship right yeah amen every one of you we all live in a three-room house that makes us all on the same level right amen I don't care you might live in the Mansion you say oh brother you stopped me I got three bedrooms and three baths or whatever listen you all live we all live in the same size three room house that's what the prophet said how many of those said that amen yeah and his body's own spirit we're all in this we're locked in right here and then he also identified those three rooms as I think he said on this order the um kitchen The Parlor in the bedroom yes and he said now in here you know I like two couples whenever maybe they come together they get married or whatever and uh he said out here they eat we have Fellowship I guess we're going to have that here's what I heard oh that'd be wonderful because you know what I didn't have much breakfast this morning but I had some good fellowship with the Lord thinking about what was going to have today amen and so I'm going to have a little appetite after a while right but you know what in there when you eat together oh wow that's having real Fellowship you sat down across the table or next door you know somebody here rub shoulders with somebody and enjoy a good meal right amen refreshing something satisfying take away your hunger well then after the kitchen you know you're going to kind of retire a little bit toward the Parlor I think he said you know and you get a little bit more closer relationship like a a man that was taking his wife into her new house and that's good to have Fellowship then he said there's where you have relationships right amen and just Fellowship is not sufficient but Fellowship is necessary to bring us to what is sufficient amen relationship amen so my subject tonight again Fellowship on two relationships amen amen and the importance and the purpose of Fellowship amen now Jesus spoke of the fellowship that he opened his the foundation of the world all right remember that right amen oh my what was it God and his fault God and His attributes amen my God and His GPS's he's getting it all coordinated wasn't it ain't no messing up for that man's satellites might not always this storm might mess it up you know right you might not get the signal from the satellite but oh I'll tell you what Jonah and the belly of the whale in the bottom of the sea still got a signal Jerusalem you know there was a sacrifice over there and he had met God's requirement once again while I turn oh he knew Solomon had prayed and dedicated the temple amen that GPS worked yes sir man amen when man didn't have enough Intuition or sense or Godly drawing why they get rejected the message that's right same thing comes again today is that right yeah amen yes fellowship before the foundation of the world now if Christ had fellowship with us okay and the scripture plainly declares he hath predestinated us together with Christ before the foundation then that makes you just as predestinated as Christ is amen that's right and the same you love Christ but if he loves you with the same love right right sir yes then you can no more fail that Christ can fail all right amen and God desires your fellowship right there just as much as he deserved The Fellowship of Christ yeah amen in fact the prophet put it like this when Jesus was praying in Saint John 17 the only thing he asked for for himself was for your fellowship yes which seems selfish huh or something for himself but God is totally unselfish that's right man he's totally unselfish but he did ask for your fellowship that's where I am there they may be also what do you like when the word of God is made manifest that was the prophet's definition of Life your name if we walk in the light as he's in the night light not Methodist light yeah Luther Knight not Pentecost flights we'll walk we'll walk walk in the light is that right sure amen such a beautiful light shines where the Dew drops of Mercy are bright called fellowshipping with his attributes but you know what that was not perfect Fellowship God wasn't satisfied just with that Fellowship that we had before the foundation where amen he wasn't satisfied with that right ah do you know what worship was not perfected the Angels if God was satisfied with the fellowship and worship of the Angels he'd never made you amen amen your worship is more desired than the angels are God was talking about Mary nursing the word yes bringing it to maturity the word was a thought expressed in the mind of God first and then it was spoken yeah amen Elohim become gave birth to himself that's right all that was in there with him he poured into Christ God Elohim giving birth to himself yes oh oh my God here he comes look oh gosh coming forth ah no no more but all that was in God Amen not part of what was in God oh that was in God he poured into Christ here comes right fellowship and with Abraham on the plates of memory yes amen having communion with Abraham down there he's you know right that's right and coming on down it became Jesus Christ what was it God coming on down yes condescending Fellowship amen right amen hallelujah Fellowship yes sir amen come on down God condescending he could never think in terms of my sinning he's already the highest that's right eternity to Eternity but you can only think in terms of condescending materializing yes the program and Plan of Redemption is Jehovah God or Elohim materializing himself thank you oh brother coming on down coming on down but you know what then he let these attribute seeds right right bypass their theophany come on down for they can be tempted right and that's the difference between Christ and you've seen yeah oh my God he became see that melchized dick in that word form body and so forth in theophany form uh in morphia see it just got changing his mask he's doing all things that's right amen but you know what when he came down on Earth and took on the form of Flesh he didn't necessarily know all things that's right it was God limiting himself in a man no man not even the son of man the father only yes yes a lot of things Jesus didn't know when he was right here on Earth that's right amen Revelation chapter 1 verse one the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him amen what was it his future Ministry in the church it had to be revealed to him at the right time in the right season and here he is 98.d sending it back to the church through John oh Amen brother how many is going to get to be here tomorrow how many is going to get to be here tomorrow how many is going to have to leave and won't get to be here tomorrow just a few oh I wish we could keep you over I know brother Dale feels the same way my this is a little primer tonight for what we got done there's this little primer here it's just setting the stage brother Longoria it's just a little appetizer my little heart for these Services you all just keep pulling and we'll have a good time amen amen and those of you have to be back to your own church we understand that too and we'll be praying for you yes indeed now but let's keep this good thought okay one mind one Accord amen amen mind on Christ is that right fellowshipping with him he loves that amen now look Harry come on down in flesh and we see that that Harmony existed between the father and the son I do nothing except the father shows me forever fellowship and Harmony must exist between the bride amen and Christ amen amen is that true yeah all right then we see it now coming on down but you know what it's wonderful you know those disciples have wonderful fellowship with the Lord Jesus when he's here walking the shores of Galilee Mary and Martha you know oh my washing his feet and all these things you know that must have been wonderful and the fellowship they had in the communion chamber that last night it was wonderful amen but you know what Fellowship was not perfected when Christ was here on Earth walking with his disciples hand in hand sleeping with them and everything else oh I slept with the prophet I got his picture up on the church wall I got this at the other boy I do too but see that that perfect your fellowship that's right amen amen amen amen here we see now that right at the community table the night of the Betrayal that Christ was in the park right yes the preachers of the message of the hour the leaders God's chosen now they were the elected ones that's right but they was fussing and arguing about who's going to be the greatest that's right who's going to have the biggest church who's going to have the biggest following amen who is going to have the biggest Revelation oh yeah all right who's going to be the greatest Among Us that ain't no way to have Fellowship so you know what the Lord Jesus done he just took his he said now what I'm going to do here you won't understand it right now but you will understand later yes right and he didn't just take his outer garment off he just took it everything and girded himself only with a towel I believe that's right laid aside his garments plural right yes and girded himself what was that he was unveiling named us amen amen thank God I'm having become a football team taking a stitch right off of our feet humbling himself come on yes yes or taking you out of your stuff shirt or whatever yeah mine on the road to Damascus Paul Saul and Parks has got a name change he was highly exalted by major right right amen God took him off of his feet and put him in that Damascus Road dust and brother bear said when you rise above that dust in the Damascus Road you get above God help us Fellowship comes through humility right amen now here was Jesus having fellowship with his disciples that was wonderful and he didn't want to leave them he left them to the end but they knew he had another thing coming that was going to be greater and he said he who is that with you shall be in you amen amen this Fellowship is going to get good Christ in you the hope of today and he blooms all the time there's something down here tonight who sung that song tonight oh God bless you my brother I just heard that as I was coming in I just done my soul so much good amen my Lily in the Bible and he blooms how many can say Jesus is my Lily hallelujah it's not always let's give Jesus soul is and that's where you grow yes amen we asked for comfort and he sends his trials he knows what's good for us amen amen Fellowship on a higher order then the disciples had fellowship with one another on the day of Pentecost like they've never known before they had Unity do you know brother Ben said the disciples did not one another or even with Christ while he was here with him on the Earth you say but my Bible School of Theology and Theology and Jesus himself was a teacher for three and a half years that's good that's true that's wonderful that's right but he said also the prophet of God and it brings your profit he said this for a reason he said Jesus and his disciples had no fellowship or unities where do you excuse me I'm kind of Italian Fellowship you understand for the sake of emphasize they didn't have that True Fellowship didn't have that true Unity right right see there's a True Fellowship amen not true in contrasting with false okay but ah full Revelation yes and full Fellowship as contrasted with partial Fellowship that's right oh my God but you know what even with the baptism the Holy Ghost Christ on the inside of him that wasn't all there was to it at that right all right right oh my all right because we've been promised a body like his own glorious body anything we can really help fellowship with him we're going to come to the marriage except for the lamb set across the table and he'll take those Blood Stained or Mouse card hands yeah how many numbers the prophet taught us that Jesus Christ will still have nail scarred hands in heaven that's right amen and he'll take them down oh man what the tears of joy from our eyes say it's all right son it's all over now don't wait no more oh Fellowship that'll be brother I believe that I believe it I'm looking forward to that Fellowship amen and that's just for three and a half years that ain't all it is to it hey you know we wasn't Mitch do I mean Heaven up yonder we was made for the Earth that's right amen amen amen Souls under the altar crying how long how long they won't come back there before they belong right all right well without it the Bible says yes God created this Earth for people to dwell on the future home with an Earthly bride and the Heavenly bridegroom will be right here hallelujah they'll be cleansed and purged amen the atmosphere is our lady right that's right but the Earth itself won't be as we say a knowledge it be changed is that right yes that's what happens you redeems you the same way he does here amen oh thank God that old Nature's got to die oh my that old Nature's got to die before you can have Fellowship from Christ yes amen thank you how many remembers Mabel's wife Abigail before she could have any True Fellowship with the King Mabel that old fool had to die amen you know what started his death a message from David spoken word message oh my the Judgment was at hand that's right and you're nearly already escaped but whenever she spoke in herself he didn't Escape it his heart the heart of her husband began to die yes stone stone becomes a stone he layered for about 10 days but he died that's right then she could be married to David invisible Union of Christ in the bride here on Earth I heard brother Tom I think said somebody it's got to take place here this Fellowship in the spirit this Union this relationship I'm talking about has to take place here yeah amen amen or you'll never have a glorified body there when we come back to the Earth thank you Jesus we'll be able to just Fellowship yeah Rule and reign with Christ throughout the ceaseless ages of Christ in his family right here in full Fellowship is that right yes Hallelujah that's what he created man for in the first place see right was for perfect Fellowship amen it'll be glorious when we get that glorified body amen you know down here we're limited we'll get tired many are the afflictions ah many are the afflictions of the righteous yes many but the Lord delivereth him out of them all right we were limited in our fellowship here two degrees we get tired in our bodies we're limited with time right yes amen we're limiting my dares but oh brother when we go beyond that curtain the time we just arrived that's all right all right when we've been there 10 000 years we've just begun in that Fellowship yes this is the message now Elohim Lonesome Elohim longing for your fellowship imperfections and how can you do that through the word amen how you gonna get under this Blood by the bleeding word of the hour the bleeding word the bloody word bleeding blood the worst the bride in by the washing of the water of the word all right amen yes self-existing one existing in eternity all my Desiring Fellowship yes listen now what's your objective for being here today Pastor preacher all right member housewife husband yes what is your objective for Fellowship if you come here with the wrong motive and or the wrong objective or you know we need to check our motives and objectives reasons amen for daily five just come fellowship with you so you'll scratch my back come fellowship with me see now bless God you know I've been your way and the road runs both ways and if you don't come see me no more hey come back yes what kind of what kind of Fellowship is that right grab you by the time you don't behave yourself you know what kind of love is that see amen remember how brother Brown said this my wife was stood uh sister media was grabbed him by the time say now again when you go overseas you better not have eyes for any other woman yeah well what's your motive an objective what is our motive and objective for Fellowship examine yourselves this morning uh this afternoon Fellowship I mean it's heard the message restoration to Brad tree amen amen amen all right if you haven't heard it lately go back and listen to it again because their Prophet God talks about how that the bride Tree on the day of Pentecost had all the fruits and all the leaves on the tree yeah all the branches all the bark it was a fruitful tree right right for the second Adam a bride right for the Tree of Life Christ and so Satan didn't like that and the first thing he done was destroy the fruits of the spirit the softest tenderest part of the tree he ate away love joy and peace yes and all the fruits of the spirit he came in the form of that canker worm uh or or uh popper worm and ate all the fruit off the tree stripped it yeah all right the next tender part of the tree was the leaves brother Graham said that was Fellowship the devil knows the power of Fellowship yeah you wonder why he had a hard time getting here today right that's right how many had a little struggle just a little struggle at least getting here amen amen the devil didn't want you to come all right he don't want you to have Fellowship he hates it he hates it yeah he hates it yes yes he hated him so much he just sent the the uh the locusts right and a big swarm of locusts landed in on the church and started destroying the leaves on the on the bride tree that's right what former president destroy the fellowship right yes destroying the fellowship were the leaves you know clap their hands together on the coup of the leaves like Abraham having fellowship with Elohim there on the planes of memory you know oh my God the devil knows the power of Fellowship why yes why he studies very best to divide this little bride and Conquer her that's right amen that's right for the round Center problem is we're disunified together yes again see there's a difference between union and unity we walk real genuine Fellowship Godly affections one for another God help me huh yeah I wanted my heart my life amen my little assembly God's got to get some revelation of the importance of it yeah yeah yes indeed amen I believe that's what he's trying to do get us out of the kitchen and the Parlor and get us in the bedroom all right amen amen I gotta try to find a place to wind this up now cause they're gonna keep you all day can you take a little bit more all right my fellowship in the in the mystery of the word yes a wonderful simplest I know this is simple but see God's hidden and revealed in simply said amen sure yes he is fellowship leads to relationship right yes your daddy's that's responsible to keep your daughters under your headship until the preacher says who gives this woman to be married to this man I am a father at the moment that young lady ought to stay under hit chip until then is that right amen you see her the Holy Ghost he goes to her Holy Ghost whom she gets the Holy Ghost how are you accountable yeah you see her flipping with a unbeliever some curly-headed kick-headed flicker yes better be careful that's right you better look at it she's not meeting the requirements of this messenger he's not meeting the requirements you better look out is that right Amen brother Wendell Martin was just minister of course last night and he was talking about a little sister in his church Godly little sister but she got to flirting with you know this unbeliever and he said what do you see in him anyway and she said oh don't you know he's a unbeliever she said oh but he makes me laugh he makes me laugh well that seemed little unbeliever got her pregnant and now that same one that made her laugh is making her cry hey we got a responsibility to stay under the headship of the word and if you want your wives husbands to be in real fellowship with you you get in fellowship with Christ amen amen if you want your wife to be under Hatchet amen of the hour your husband he's subject to him right yeah amen the reveal word is your husband is that what we're taught yeah amen gotta kind of try to condense this and bring it down to a close cause I don't want to take advantage of you seven instead leading up pyramid to the or he called it so the king's chamber and on the seventh step is where the introducer comes forth to introduce the comer unto The King and I want to ask the question today in your relationship or your fellowship with Christ under the blood where are you at are you just on the seventh step or are you in the king's chamber yes are you just in a fellowship standing on the front porch and fellowship out there on the steps you know that's right yeah or are you in a relationship yes in the king's chamber there has to be a relationship and when that relationship comes this relationship I'm talking about where your soul is sealed in with God eternity behind the veil where the glory never fails brother the womb of the soul is sealed closed and no other seed can conceive or take place from then on and the prophet of God taught us that this little bride is already called amen he said was already married to Christ and he also said she's pregnant that's right yes what a relationship not just a fellowship anymore God's looking for relationship amen yes this Fellowship must be culminated amen like a marriage is culminated amen is that true that's what God's looking for amen oh such an intimate relationship in behind the veil you know a hazardous king of hazardous ousted bestie through the voice of his seventh the seventh of the seven uh Messengers who knew law and judgment and were in the presence of the king the seventh when mimican gave advice and counsel and there was an indictment that's right lectures been an indictment by the seventh messenger today and the king and here to his advice investing was acted forever eternally separated from the king's Fellowship that's right but Esther was chosen right yeah now there was 127th of them in fellowship with the king oh yeah I'm trying to tell you now that Fellowship alone is not sufficient amen amen have I got your attention amen Fellowship alone is not sufficient oh it's wonderful we gotta have it and it's necessary to have the right kind of Fellowship yes right right but there's something more yes 127 women had fellowship with the King they went in one night with the king oh what a text that being one night with a king uh-huh and then they went out and they went to the house of the concubines and they return no more to the house of the king except the king had pleasure in them delighted in them and remembered their name and call them body amen amen the Mysteries are called in the names of the elect yes a death Mr she got a name change from something Earthly you know a murder tree a little Evergreen Bush to a star shooting star yes amen and she was called not just to a fellowship just called to relationship amen this bride must be in this hour that's right amen come out of the fellowship on up into the relationship does that do away with Fellowship no it just gets greater yes it is that right sure seven steps leading up to the king's chamber there is where the invisible Union has taken place for the for real true seed of God it is taking place and that blood will never lose its power till that last one comes in is that right sure he's still interceding until that last one comes in has to be there sure amen amen only for the elect of course only the elected are considered in this Redemption now where are you in your fellowship with God see that's the question you ask yourself are you really spiritually impregnated with the very Life of Christ and your womb sealed bringing forth Christ the word to full maturity in your life to the Statue of fullness of Jesus Christ the perfect man or or you maybe stagnated yeah there's a lot of difference between being pregnated and stagnated now the womb must be sealed no other seed can hold or take hold once you come into that King's chamber into that relationship now I'm just gonna close but I didn't really plan this but since they brought my briefcase up here I'm reminded of the pilot you know and the pilate's wife and I take what I better do maybe I'll just I didn't even read it a lot of these scriptures or quotes but I'm just I'm not going to take advantage of because I know if I wear you out um you won't be able to be the good for good morning and uh but you know what do you ever hear about the judge that uh he uh his daughter got to she got a big ticket I mean a big ticket she was really way out of order and it just happened that she had to come before her own daddy as a judge and he didn't spare no because he's still the judge right now she's crying because he's landed on her heavy and he's fighting her and he found her guilty right right and she's crying and carrying on and everything of course he's in his robes you know and he's behind the there with a gaffle in his hand and he's got the order he's the judge but you know this to me Daddy you know who I am I'm your daughter he said yes I was your daughter yesterday but today I'm your judge all right yes and it hurts me as much as it hurts you but you know what after he passed the sentence David Jackson properly met the requirements of the law right he took his robe off Oh my he came out from behind the he came out behind there he got his wallet out he paid the fine for her after daddy amen yes indeed yes the lawyer you know the devil's setting in on the court today Devil's accuser the brother that's right he's the uh indictor he's that prosecutor have prosecuted an attorney he said it can name that finds you guilty if he can got a good friend of mine who's a prosecuting attorney and uh you know that's to be business the devil's business is to find you guilty if he can can then make you feel guilty as long as you're under conviction and condemnation you can't have faith that's right and you sure can't help rapturing Faith right right can't have perfect faith can't have no perfect Fellowship can't have no perfect relationship long as you got a spirit of conviction and condemnation on you right see God wants you to be free he wants you to know he loves and he wants your fellowship here this morning this afternoon amen he's paid the price so he can have it he's Desiring your fellowship more than your Desiring he is young or old middle-aged God loves you amen amen it's all purpose of being is you yes and nobody can take your place in the economy of God Amen that's God's love to you yes nobody I might not have much education and this that the other oh I might not be very ugly might be stupid shoulder and gray-haired but hey ain't nobody gonna take your place in the economy of God God's love to you amen yes can you go forsake you when you get old that's right no he won't he sure won't do it now you might get old and staggle toothed or no teeth at all you might get bald-headed and blind oh my you know what God's doing he just surrendered you right to himself he's taking the fight out of you so he can have fellowship with you amen Amen brother Branham the Holy Spirit spoke through the prophet said William Bradley ain't got nothing to do with this they have nothing to do with this he said I've surrendered his life to me Hallelujah don't you know he fought about 17 professional belts and didn't lose or what but on that last one he almost lost God must have gotten that opponent and he's going to whip this year little Prophet into life yeah he was looking like a Baptist preacher but he wasn't acting like no Baptist preacher that's right still ready to fight has to drop that don't you call me no Baptist preacher you better smile when you say that yeah yeah remember what he's he's buddy there don't you refer to me as no looking like no preacher you better have a smile on your face when you say that he hated the thought of him being a preacher God had to take some fight out of him yes sir boy about halfway through that fight I guess or somewhere along in there he said God he thought sure that guy's gonna kill him he said Lord if you ever if you just let me get through I thought maybe I could just bring it to draw he said and we just fight this could draw somehow and he promised God in the middle of that fight God if you don't help me to get through this if you'll save me don't let me be killed you can just help me I promise you I'll never fight again yeah amen what would y'all be doing surrendering his life to himself amen I surrendered my life to God I done this and I've done that you never sought God even to start with amen that's the nature of man it's a run from God yes it is God seeking man that's what
