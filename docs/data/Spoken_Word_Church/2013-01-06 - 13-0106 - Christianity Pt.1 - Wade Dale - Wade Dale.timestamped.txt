[0:15] get another server but everything they
[0:16] got they lost so they're gonna have to
[0:19] pull it out literally
[0:21] we have it back up here
[0:33] so just pray that that will all come
[0:35] together
[0:36] so that's not all
[0:38] you know the heat right
[0:39] yeah we got no heat upstairs but i mean
[0:41] we got heat daddy came up here six
[0:43] o'clock this morning turned up electric
[0:44] fans on so if you get hot deal with it
[0:48] you get cold deal with it
[0:50] well the other thing with this web
[0:51] server is all the brothers that work on
[0:53] it have full-time jobs
[1:20] actually you don't know what you're
[1:21] talking about
[1:26] 68 degrees is what it's set on always it
[1:28] never gets below 68. i have seen it
[1:31] below seasick i'm telling you i haven't
[1:33] seen everything
[1:34] i guess
[1:36] must be blind because it never has been
[1:37] on sick
[1:39] all right let's go we're going to
[1:43] we have had i've had three people turn
[1:45] in suggestions and
[1:47] jim made a suggestion last night
[1:49] right before we went to bed so
[1:52] i guess the rest of you don't care what
[1:54] we do
[1:55] because i asked you to do it a couple
[1:56] weeks ago
[1:58] um
[2:00] but brother ray
[2:03] sent one to me which is really
[2:06] i want to read this to you and then i
[2:08] want to show you what the other person
[2:10] gave me and then what the other person
[2:11] gave me and then what i've been kind of
[2:14] jim kind of
[2:15] uh don't know it but she kind of put the
[2:17] punctuation part on it last night so
[2:21] um
[2:22] because beyond popular beliefs you know
[2:24] i don't discuss much about the what i'm
[2:26] preaching or what i'm studying or
[2:28] anything like that so
[2:30] you kind of want to keep the keep your
[2:32] mind open you know for
[2:33] for what the lord wants you to do but
[2:37] brother ray sent me one from healing and
[2:38] what sickness is in 1950
[2:42] it says now there may be things this is
[2:44] brother brown that god has added to the
[2:46] church which stimulate faith
[2:49] but now when i'm gone healing isn't gone
[2:52] healing ought to be more than it was
[2:55] before we come here
[2:57] see see that's the purpose is to get the
[2:59] people in their mind
[3:02] in the spirit of the latter days
[3:05] we're in the latter day
[3:08] you believe that we are the world is in
[3:10] the spirit of the latter days but the
[3:12] church is not in the latter day spirit
[3:14] yet right
[3:17] see in other words we may be in a
[3:19] portion
[3:22] but god wants his church so in the
[3:24] spirit till they'll just fit the just
[3:27] anywhere god
[3:29] were to lead them to
[3:32] the latter days are rending of the world
[3:34] my my look at the places eating drinking
[3:37] marrying giving in marriage and all the
[3:38] immoral there is in the world the devil
[3:40] sent down his troops in the latter-day
[3:42] spirit
[3:44] which is allowed to see them and we may
[3:47] discuss that a little bit
[3:50] but we ministers haven't got the church
[3:53] yet in that spirit
[3:56] and we must be in that condition in
[3:59] order to be caught away in the rapture
[4:02] when he comes back
[4:03] that's right
[4:04] okay so brother brother uh
[4:06] ray's point was how to get the church
[4:09] and the latter-day spirit right right
[4:12] and then sister regina sent me one that
[4:14] says maybe we can do a focus on the
[4:16] bride
[4:18] and the end time
[4:20] or is it time to revisit the statue of a
[4:23] perfect man
[4:24] one level at a time
[4:26] okay
[4:27] and then sister johnny
[4:31] 35 question
[4:39] show why every purpose this is the first
[4:41] one now i didn't tell her what order to
[4:42] put these in but if you're if you're a
[4:44] little bit spiritual you're going to see
[4:45] all these fit together
[4:47] show why every purpose and redemption
[4:49] from the fall of man to the day of
[4:51] pentecost centers
[4:53] in the new birth
[4:55] and then after that it's just
[4:58] all kind of other things but the very
[5:00] first one
[5:01] was that
[5:02] and then jim kind of was talking about
[5:05] last night
[5:07] and it wasn't exactly what she said but
[5:09] what i've been thinking about doing is
[5:12] is doing
[5:13] a series
[5:15] on the new birth
[5:17] aside
[5:19] from this message
[5:24] well this message is not the new birth
[5:28] right
[5:29] luther was born again under luther's age
[5:32] and he didn't know anything about seals
[5:33] plagues violence wool trumpets etc
[5:37] i didn't say it you understand when i
[5:38] say you didn't know anything about it he
[5:40] knew a partial remember brother brown
[5:41] said right here this is a good quote i
[5:43] like this quote i'm going to keep it i
[5:44] keep it in my bible now
[5:46] but he says we're in the latter days you
[5:48] believe that the church is not in the
[5:49] latter day spirit yet in other words we
[5:52] may be in a portion
[5:56] all right but it's the portion for our
[5:58] day but we're in the last day
[6:01] what's latter day mean last we're in the
[6:03] last day
[6:04] all right
[6:05] so if we don't act like christians
[6:07] forget about the message that's right
[6:10] all right we don't like christians
[6:11] forget about the messenger
[6:14] but i think we've just kind of started
[6:16] and i'll be honest
[6:18] we see people even in this church you
[6:19] just walk into church and just start
[6:20] coming to church
[6:23] that's head knowledge right that's right
[6:25] that's head knowledge
[6:26] brother brown said you ought to be able
[6:28] to read that about the fall and read
[6:29] about the water baptism that's just the
[6:32] ability to read the devil puts this
[6:35] message together
[6:37] but the devil can't live he either lives
[6:39] a devil life or you either live a devil
[6:41] life or a god life
[6:45] no gray area
[6:47] sure we have this guy to deal with which
[6:49] deals and where i think that's what
[6:50] we'll do but see that's the part of what
[6:52] regina was saying about the statue of a
[6:53] perfect man
[6:55] or
[6:56] the bride at the end time well
[6:58] we got to start know what the
[6:59] characteristics of the bride in the
[7:01] beginning was
[7:03] my sister johnny said the new birth on
[7:05] the day of pentecost
[7:07] what did it do to those people
[7:11] it didn't bring them into
[7:13] our message sure our message is
[7:15] important
[7:18] but brother brown said you could take a
[7:19] an egg and land under a
[7:21] a dog
[7:23] right environment
[7:25] and it'll birth it'll be birth
[7:28] but now
[7:29] here's my point and i'll try to make
[7:31] that point all through the through the
[7:33] year that we that we stay on this
[7:36] is that i believe you can be born again
[7:39] outside of
[7:41] hearing of this message hold on
[7:45] but once you do
[7:48] the message
[7:49] you will become the message
[7:53] you can't be born again in this age and
[7:55] not because see luther you can't be born
[7:58] again in luther's age and not be under
[8:00] luther's
[8:01] but see you've got to remember too let's
[8:02] go back up and let's say we'll see
[8:04] because remember this is not going to be
[8:06] it's not be cut and dry because you had
[8:08] people coming out of
[8:11] paul's day
[8:13] overlapping in the irenaeus's day some
[8:15] of irenas's teachings was paul's of
[8:17] course but paul had his own converts
[8:20] that may have lapped over into
[8:22] irenaeus's age everybody understand that
[8:25] same way with pentecost because brother
[8:27] brown calls pentecost faults in certain
[8:29] places but he's talking about the
[8:31] denomination pentecost as far as
[8:35] all right the denomination pentecost is
[8:37] false but now
[8:39] the people in there weren't faults to a
[8:41] degree because look at brother
[8:43] bondsworth
[8:44] he toured with brother brown for about
[8:46] 18 years before he died 18 years
[8:50] and he never accepted
[8:51] the message
[8:54] but brother brown called him the old oak
[8:55] tree
[8:57] gonna be there he said
[9:00] brother brown said under his teaching
[9:01] because he was back from that
[9:03] pentecostal age
[9:05] he never come into the be the true light
[9:08] of lord jesus christ baptism but yet god
[9:11] winked at that ignorance
[9:12] but now we have to pay attention now
[9:15] that as we come through this i want you
[9:17] to realize something
[9:19] when we do get to the epitome or the
[9:21] apex of what god wants
[9:23] yes it is separate from anything else
[9:26] it is separate from denomination it is
[9:28] separate from this it is separate from
[9:30] that
[9:31] but but it's not that you're it's not
[9:33] that because you believe the message
[9:34] you're automatically born again
[9:40] no you've got to get born again
[9:42] then the message becomes alive that's
[9:44] right
[9:45] the bible says the letter killeth and
[9:47] that's what's happening to a lot of
[9:48] people the letter's killing you and you
[9:51] don't know it you're sitting right here
[9:53] in the church and you
[9:54] but your life's going to prove it
[9:55] somewhere that's right
[10:00] and i would to god like daddy said i
[10:02] would god and everybody would realize
[10:03] that hey i got what i thought i had yes
[10:05] that's right then we can start
[10:08] because once we go up through here
[10:10] up to the statue of a perfect man
[10:13] you will not be able to understand the
[10:15] things of god without having god inside
[10:16] of him
[10:18] okay so that's how we're going to
[10:20] approach this
[10:22] i was thinking of going one way or the
[10:23] other but when jim said that last night
[10:25] i thought well and then sister johnny
[10:26] brought me this i thought well maybe god
[10:28] this is the way you want to do because i
[10:29] was talking
[10:31] to myself the other day
[10:33] about what brother ray had said how to
[10:34] approach that to getting a latter day
[10:36] spirit
[10:37] well to get in the latter day spirit you
[10:39] got to have a fear
[10:41] you either got the latter day spirit of
[10:43] laodicea
[10:45] or you've got the latter-day spirit of
[10:46] the new birth
[10:48] which is not different than the new
[10:49] birth they had on the day of pentecost
[10:51] and not different than luther's or
[10:52] wesley and all that
[10:54] god's always the same that's right he
[10:57] always has his basic foundation
[11:01] then he grows from that or he raises you
[11:03] up actually from that foundation right
[11:06] just like the statue of a perfect man no
[11:07] one taught the statue of a perfect man
[11:10] even peter would stand up and say add to
[11:13] your faith knowledge and all this temper
[11:15] patience peace and godliness
[11:17] but those people
[11:18] that was a prophecy for me and you
[11:21] there's certain things in the scripture
[11:23] and like what some of the things that
[11:25] sister johnny and like
[11:27] virginia here maybe you can do a focus
[11:28] on the bride at the end time well we got
[11:30] to see what a bride does and how a bride
[11:32] acts first
[11:35] there's going to be billions of people
[11:37] in heaven that's never heard of william
[11:39] brown
[11:41] because they did one thing we're going
[11:43] to read it turn to john 3.
[11:50] and this thing's not starting so i don't
[11:52] know what
[11:56] i don't know what the deal is
[11:59] not recording so
[12:00] that will anyway all right
[12:05] it's going to be important we're going
[12:07] to um i'm going to be gone on the 27th
[12:09] of january lord william going to brother
[12:11] pinkston for a couple days so
[12:16] the bob will take over for that weekend
[12:18] so
[12:19] but we're going to really drive this
[12:21] thing home
[12:24] and and make a commitment or i am
[12:28] that i'm going to find out if i got
[12:29] really got what i think i got
[12:33] and the only way you can do it is is by
[12:36] the word
[12:37] right not reading a message book now
[12:38] listen i want y'all to get this thing
[12:40] we're not kicking the message out i hope
[12:41] you know that right
[12:43] this message is totally the most
[12:45] important thing outside of this
[12:48] right
[12:49] outside of getting born again the
[12:51] message you've got to hear it you've got
[12:52] to listen to what brother because that
[12:54] is god speaking to you what he's doing
[12:56] is is he he sent a messenger
[12:59] to take all these mysteries that's in
[13:00] the bible
[13:02] and say here you're my bride i'm the
[13:03] only one you're you're the only one i'm
[13:06] going to talk to
[13:07] about these things right here
[13:10] does everybody understand that we're
[13:11] going to take it slow
[13:12] these are the only things i'm going to
[13:14] show you these right here but now paul
[13:16] didn't need it
[13:18] that's right
[13:19] arenas didn't need it
[13:21] martin luther columba the reason we need
[13:24] it is just like what brother brown said
[13:25] and we'll read some quotes next sunday
[13:27] because i really didn't know which way
[13:28] to go so i didn't bring any quotes but
[13:29] i'll bring up some quotes next sunday
[13:31] is brother brown said
[13:33] what would the messenger of malachi 4 do
[13:36] two things
[13:38] right
[13:39] bring the people out and turn them back
[13:41] to the faith of the fathers all right
[13:44] because we got to realize that peter
[13:46] james and john and all those early
[13:48] church members they had this
[13:51] but it was never put together in a forum
[13:53] to where brother brown
[13:55] and that's what one of my
[13:56] comments was at the minister's meeting
[13:58] the other day everybody's going well
[13:59] brother brown's chart was wrong or they
[14:00] weren't saying that but you knew that's
[14:02] what they were saying this chart we got
[14:04] to quit
[14:05] leaning so much to charts well what
[14:07] about that one right right
[14:09] what about the statue of a perfect man
[14:10] where the angel actually drew the chart
[14:12] on the wall the same chart that they
[14:14] that he had drunk strong
[14:17] so i i believe in brother brown's charge
[14:19] i don't want nobody else's chart i don't
[14:21] know why it's drawing me a chart
[14:23] we're going to use the chart that
[14:24] william brown grew
[14:26] all right because once the brother says
[14:27] well this is well what if we study the
[14:30] hebrew series and we make a chart i said
[14:31] well that's us making the chart i said
[14:33] but brother brown will do the charcoal
[14:34] statue for the statue of perfect man he
[14:36] drew the
[14:37] he drew the one for daniel 70 weeks
[14:38] we're not trying to make this any
[14:40] different i said y'all are the ones
[14:41] trying to make this different right same
[14:43] way with that right there paul irenaeus
[14:45] and all those first
[14:46] church members
[14:48] they never had this drawn
[14:50] as a way to get up so that the headstone
[14:53] could come down
[14:55] so i'm trying to make a basis here we
[14:56] are heading toward the headstone
[14:59] but that headstone never came on the
[15:01] church in any other age except this age
[15:03] that's right
[15:04] so they weren't required
[15:07] to break down all the church age
[15:08] messengers irenaeus probably did not
[15:11] god probably did not reveal to him hey
[15:14] you're the second angel
[15:17] because it wasn't important at that time
[15:18] irenaeus knew that he had heard from god
[15:20] right iranians knew he had a message
[15:22] from god but he took brother branham to
[15:24] pull all that out
[15:27] right and say all right after your faith
[15:28] virtue well we're going to do a little
[15:30] chart here we're going to put all the
[15:31] messengers in because there's seven
[15:32] stars there's seven church ages that we
[15:35] have to go through
[15:37] all right but there's going to be
[15:38] billions of people yes i want you to get
[15:40] that in your mind billions of people
[15:42] that's not going to ever hear william
[15:43] branham that's going to be born again
[15:44] christians just as eternal as you are
[15:47] living in the city called bride
[15:58] what i thought long time ago
[16:01] brother branham come
[16:03] to put all this together because no
[16:05] other age
[16:07] that their soul was
[16:09] eternal but nobody nobody that jesus
[16:13] christ body and spirit has been eternal
[16:16] so that's why he had i see that's why he
[16:18] had to come put it all together to get
[16:21] our body and
[16:22] spirit
[16:23] uh made eternal because no other age
[16:27] that's why he had the ministry of the
[16:28] son of man the son of man was never
[16:30] spoken of except for a few times in the
[16:32] new testament the old testament in
[16:34] ezekiel said son of man prophesy son of
[16:36] man do this well that was god in human
[16:38] flesh talking to the people
[16:40] through a prophet
[16:42] but it was more of the prophet speaking
[16:44] to the people and the people never came
[16:46] to that position
[16:47] now it's not just brother dale's got to
[16:49] come to that position he's got to bring
[16:51] a group of people to that position
[16:52] that's right
[16:54] so it's not just a one-man show
[16:57] it's a it's a whole unit of a bride has
[16:59] got to be brought up because there's no
[17:00] other age we can't just say well there's
[17:03] another age coming we'll just live and
[17:04] die and there's another prophet going to
[17:06] raise up and he'll tell us how to do it
[17:07] no this is it
[17:10] that's why the scriptures now are not
[17:12] prophecy anymore
[17:14] they're reality that's right
[17:17] paul prophesied we which are alive and
[17:19] remain well he's dead he's not a weed no
[17:22] more that's right now
[17:24] we are
[17:25] we
[17:26] which are alive and remain and they
[17:27] could have said it in any other age but
[17:29] there's no other age to hand it to
[17:31] that's right but remember all the
[17:33] prophets wanted to see this day you know
[17:35] why this is what i believe the prophets
[17:37] knew they only saw a little portion of
[17:39] god okay
[17:42] but we see the fullness yes
[17:44] if you don't get the fullness of god we
[17:46] can't bring him back here and that's the
[17:47] problem
[17:48] to get the fullness of god though we
[17:50] ought to be born again first
[17:52] we can't be imitators that's right we
[17:54] can't be halfways
[17:55] we can't be part of the time okay
[17:58] we got to be christian
[18:00] first and foremost we got to be
[18:02] christian
[18:03] then we worry about seals and plagues
[18:05] and vials and
[18:06] you know and i'm just going to make this
[18:08] statement to all you and you can go back
[18:09] and tell everybody else in this church
[18:11] a lot of us
[18:13] me included
[18:15] we do a lot of studying
[18:17] and in our human listen in our human
[18:20] mortal mind
[18:22] we're looking for something
[18:24] that somebody else don't know that's
[18:27] right if you're honest with yourself
[18:31] you're looking for something else so you
[18:33] can have this little edge over somebody
[18:34] else that don't know anything that's
[18:36] wrong that's true that's wrong
[18:40] the bible says study to show yourself
[18:42] approved
[18:43] not approve yourself to somebody else so
[18:45] you're self-approved
[18:49] right okay that's right so and i'm i'm
[18:51] i'm guilty of it i'm telling you i'm
[18:53] guilty of we always got well we got this
[18:55] little ace card that we can that or we
[18:57] get to we get to spend a lot of time
[18:59] with brother dale you know and and the
[19:01] reason i don't spend a lot of time with
[19:02] my dad you know why because i don't want
[19:04] to influence the things he says i want
[19:06] him to come out and preach the word of
[19:07] god and let it be pure and let it hit me
[19:09] just as long as it hits everybody else
[19:11] right i swear i don't it's because
[19:14] you can do that you can influence a
[19:15] preacher we can all get to studying on
[19:17] one thing and we can influence what he
[19:19] says that's right
[19:20] right
[19:22] so the best thing to do is let's
[19:25] be christian first that's right
[19:28] then what he says will be quicken to us
[19:31] okay okay because i mean honestly quit
[19:34] doing that quit trying to be a preacher
[19:37] be a christian let god talk to you in
[19:39] your everyday life in your everyday ways
[19:41] and your every day of doing things let
[19:43] god have control of your life so that
[19:45] because remember all the sermons he
[19:47] preaches
[19:49] if you go out and live like the devil or
[19:52] you go out and somebody sees you do
[19:53] something
[19:55] that destroys everything he preached i
[19:57] don't care if it's headstone preaching
[20:00] that destroys it
[20:01] it's destroyed
[20:03] because we're going to read it in a
[20:05] little while it's the
[20:07] foundation
[20:09] that you build on
[20:11] but if the foundation is wrong
[20:13] then you're going to be wrong
[20:15] i don't care because brother brown said
[20:17] you have some of these virtues you're
[20:18] not going to be born again right right
[20:21] so what's the key be born again
[20:24] then those virtues can work the way god
[20:26] because remember power without character
[20:28] satanic and that's what our problem is
[20:30] sometimes we get so much head knowledge
[20:32] and we think we
[20:33] because we come to this church
[20:35] i'm speaking for everybody
[20:37] because we come to this church and we
[20:38] hear the word up here this high that
[20:40] we're automatically right here
[20:44] no
[20:46] brother dale's live everyday life at
[20:49] general motors
[20:50] had more influence on those people down
[20:52] there
[20:54] than any sermon he ever preached
[20:56] really
[20:59] you can ask every one of them
[21:01] philadelphia tom well
[21:04] tom but i know he said that it was the
[21:06] life
[21:07] that brother dale lived in front of him
[21:11] they knew
[21:12] that he was a christian so once they
[21:14] have confidence that you're a christian
[21:17] then you can have confidence in what the
[21:18] man says
[21:20] okay
[21:21] so we're going to approach that as as to
[21:25] that we're not going to say a lot of
[21:26] what brother brown says we're going to
[21:28] just stay with the bible now i'm going
[21:30] to bring a few quotes
[21:31] to get us started up the ladder all
[21:33] right
[21:34] but
[21:36] it's kind of like um
[21:37] i don't know who i was talking to this
[21:39] past weekend we had so much company but
[21:41] uh
[21:42] it's it's it behooves us to do better
[21:46] this year yes
[21:49] if you don't you need the new burger
[21:52] but we all need to refill it that's
[21:54] right we all need to say hey i need to
[21:57] it's like
[21:58] well it's my brother jason was talking
[22:00] wednesday a month monday night
[22:03] repent means turn around go the other
[22:04] direction
[22:06] not continue on the same path you're on
[22:08] repent means turn and going another
[22:10] direction
[22:11] so if you're doing something here turn
[22:13] around and go in another direction
[22:16] because remember the bible says at the
[22:18] end time iniquity will abound now what's
[22:20] iniquity
[22:21] that's knowing to do better and don't do
[22:23] it or knowing that you're doing
[22:25] something that you shouldn't do that's
[22:26] right
[22:27] that's iniquity that's right and if
[22:29] iniquity shall abound
[22:31] the love of many
[22:33] shall wax cold
[22:36] exactly what is the end time spirit
[22:40] okay that end time spirit that he's
[22:42] talking about is the message of the hour
[22:46] okay
[22:47] because you can't take a change of the
[22:49] body without this message but you can
[22:51] take a rapture
[22:54] right
[22:56] you can take a rapture without this
[22:58] message being a headstone to you
[23:02] but you're going to die
[23:05] but you're going to die you're not going
[23:07] to be alive
[23:08] if you're alive
[23:10] and the rapture takes place and you
[23:11] don't go
[23:12] you're lost
[23:15] period
[23:17] no gray area there at all
[23:20] but now if you die 10 minutes before the
[23:22] rapture takes place and then you're
[23:24] resurrected
[23:27] you're okay
[23:29] but the ones that are alive and remain
[23:30] that's that special group that's that
[23:32] end time that he's talking about here
[23:34] but to get to that
[23:36] but to get to that remember what i said
[23:38] if you look this quote up i want you to
[23:40] all bring it with you next sunday if you
[23:42] got a computer
[23:43] but go to healing and what sickness is
[23:45] well never mind i'll just run you off
[23:47] about 30 cops
[23:48] i'll just run
[23:52] we said the world is in the spirit of
[23:54] the latter days now what we'll do is is
[23:56] i'm going to take
[23:58] next sunday and we're going to look at
[24:01] what what layout of sea of spirit is
[24:03] because once we realize that that's the
[24:05] spirit of the age
[24:07] then we'll realize how we can react to
[24:09] it i'll just do that first
[24:11] okay
[24:12] then but god won't know
[24:15] but the church is not in the latter day
[24:16] spirit yeah he's not home by the spirit
[24:18] of leo see he's talking about the
[24:20] latter-day spirit of the end time
[24:22] believer
[24:23] all right
[24:26] in other words we may be in a portion
[24:30] all down to the church ages that's what
[24:31] it's been it's been in a portion
[24:35] but god wants his church so in the
[24:37] spirit until they'll just fit in just
[24:39] anywhere god were to lead them
[24:42] the latter day of the rendering of the
[24:44] world is drinking marrying giving them
[24:45] marriage and all immoral things but we
[24:47] ministers haven't got the church yet in
[24:49] that spirit and we must be in that
[24:51] condition
[24:53] for what condition to make a rapture
[24:56] one there's only one condition
[24:58] you're born again right
[25:01] you don't have to
[25:02] nothing else born again
[25:06] to go on a rapture to be born again is
[25:08] it
[25:09] you ain't gonna have the
[25:11] the mysteries of the seals and the
[25:13] planes and the valves and everybody
[25:14] wants to know all these great things
[25:15] just good to know them but it's going to
[25:18] be very harmful if you just know them
[25:23] right
[25:23] going to be very harmful if you just
[25:25] know them
[25:28] we'll read next sunday where the bible
[25:30] says
[25:31] people will be heady high-minded lovers
[25:33] of pleasure more than lovers of god from
[25:35] such turn away right
[25:39] from such turn away and brother branham
[25:42] i'll bring that quote next sunday maybe
[25:43] or the next couple of sundays where
[25:45] brother brown said high minded he said
[25:47] know it all
[25:48] now let's don't become know what i want
[25:54] that's what we've gotten a message a
[25:55] bunch of knowledge you know why because
[25:56] they're falling like flies
[25:58] been sitting in the messy church 25
[26:00] years been preaching the message for 15
[26:02] and 20 years and just turn it away i
[26:04] said no at all right that's right that's
[26:06] heady high mind that's a know-it-all
[26:08] that's somebody you can't tell that
[26:09] they're wrong
[26:11] but is that god no that's not god
[26:14] that's power without character that's
[26:17] right
[26:18] which is satanic that's right
[26:21] they have the power
[26:23] judas had the power heal the sick
[26:25] cast out devils
[26:27] preach the gospel
[26:30] but without character that's right it's
[26:33] satanic that's right but power with
[26:35] character bring it back over here fit to
[26:37] rule so what is power then you birth
[26:40] that's right
[26:42] right it's in power
[26:45] you'll be endured with power from on
[26:46] high jesus said that's what we're going
[26:48] to talk about now we have we even as
[26:51] christians we live a defeated life i
[26:53] know that
[26:54] even as christians we live in this
[26:56] layout of sin that's why i'm telling you
[26:58] everybody from adam to today
[27:03] or adam at least to pentecost they're
[27:05] going to be looking you up and wonder
[27:07] why because they read in this bible that
[27:08] there is an end time that people just
[27:10] barely going to make it
[27:13] because remember the five wise says hey
[27:16] we've got oil but we don't even have
[27:18] enough to give you
[27:20] go get your own in other words we sat in
[27:24] church for 20 years right
[27:27] we worshiped
[27:29] but we didn't get any oil
[27:31] and the ones with oil said i accepted
[27:35] what jesus christ did
[27:37] i accepted what
[27:38] salvation means
[27:41] and i've only got enough just to get me
[27:42] through
[27:45] so you got to go get it for yourself
[27:47] okay so let's read john three let's read
[27:49] the whole thing and then we'll go
[27:50] upstairs
[27:52] there was a man of the pharisees named
[27:53] nicodemus ruler of the jews now what was
[27:55] nicodemus not throwing off on on him but
[27:58] nicodemus was a highly intelligent man
[28:01] of the scriptures right yes he knew the
[28:03] letter yes
[28:06] he needs a letter
[28:08] but he did not know the spirit or jesus
[28:10] would not have said what he said all
[28:11] right
[28:13] the same came to jesus by night that's
[28:15] another clue
[28:17] that he really didn't believe what jesus
[28:19] was saying he came to him by night
[28:21] slipped in the back door and said unto
[28:23] him rabbi
[28:24] we know that thou art a teacher oh in
[28:26] other words
[28:28] brother dale
[28:30] we know you're a teacher come from god
[28:33] for no man can do these miracles that
[28:35] doesn't accept god be with them that's
[28:37] what that's what everybody should be
[28:38] saying
[28:39] that's not born again they say oh we
[28:41] know brother dale's a good teacher we
[28:43] know by the way this good teacher we
[28:44] know this isn't real this is good and
[28:46] this and then
[28:47] but jesus said um barely barely i'm
[28:50] saying to you and except you'd be born
[28:52] again
[28:53] that's just lip service
[28:55] let me quote that in 21st century
[28:57] language
[28:58] he told nicodemus and that's what he
[29:00] said
[29:01] except a man be born again
[29:03] not born not b-o-r-n-e-d i know
[29:06] sometimes we say born it's not that it's
[29:07] born
[29:09] again
[29:11] we'll read that a little a little bit
[29:12] later born again not born
[29:16] born again
[29:18] he cannot see
[29:21] or understand the word means see means
[29:23] to understand in other words he's saying
[29:25] nicodemus
[29:26] you're saying i am a great preacher
[29:29] right
[29:32] but you don't know nothing about what
[29:34] i'm saying
[29:37] is what he said
[29:39] you don't know one thing and you know
[29:40] what nicodemus pruned it
[29:43] if i gotta go back in my mama's womb he
[29:45] natural
[29:47] all right
[29:48] jesus answered and said to him very
[29:49] verily or listen listen
[29:52] i say unto you except a man be born
[29:54] again he cannot see the kingdom of god
[29:56] nicodemus said unto him how can a man be
[29:58] born when he is old
[30:00] can he enter the second time into his
[30:01] mother's womb and be born jesus said
[30:03] very verily listen listen
[30:05] i say unto thee except a man be born of
[30:07] water and of spirit he cannot enter into
[30:11] the kingdom of god
[30:14] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[30:17] that which is born of the spirit of
[30:18] spirit so he separated the two all right
[30:21] marvel not
[30:24] in other words don't be surprised that
[30:26] i'm saying
[30:28] what's marvel
[30:30] you marvel at something you look on
[30:31] something with with
[30:33] with all or you look on something with
[30:34] no understanding all right
[30:38] marvel not that i said unto thee
[30:41] you must be born again
[30:43] the wind bloweth where it listens and
[30:44] now here's the sound thereof but cast
[30:47] can't not tell when's it coming and
[30:49] whether it goeth so is everyone that is
[30:52] born of the spirit nicodemus answered
[30:54] and said unto him how can these things
[30:56] be
[30:57] all right
[30:59] jesus answered and said
[31:02] have you not been in a message long
[31:04] enough to know
[31:06] right are not thou a master of israel in
[31:09] other words don't you know what the
[31:10] message says
[31:13] and know it's not these things verily
[31:15] verily listen listen again i say unto
[31:17] thee we speak
[31:19] that we do know
[31:21] and testify that we have seen
[31:23] and you receive not your witness
[31:25] if i have told you earthly things and
[31:27] you believe not how shall you believe if
[31:29] i tell you heavenly things there's a
[31:32] separation you're not going to know what
[31:34] i say just by earthly
[31:36] knowledge sure you're going to get a
[31:37] knowledge to a certain degree i
[31:38] understand that
[31:40] and no man has to ascend it up to heaven
[31:43] but he that came down from heaven even
[31:45] the son of man which is in heaven and he
[31:46] was standing right there in front of
[31:48] what was heaven heaven consists of the
[31:49] word so the word was standing there so
[31:52] he was in heaven
[31:54] the day of the lord
[31:56] is in heaven that's right
[31:57] jesus was in the day of the lord he was
[31:59] the lord remember he said he i'm the
[32:01] lord of the harvest
[32:02] okay so he was the lord and as moses
[32:05] lifted up the serpent in the wilderness
[32:07] even so must the son of man be lifted up
[32:09] talking of his death
[32:12] that whosoever
[32:14] believeth in him should not perish
[32:16] but have eternal life
[32:18] for god so loved the world that he gave
[32:21] his only begotten son that whosoever
[32:24] believeth in him should not perish but
[32:26] have everlasting life he said that twice
[32:28] you see that don't you
[32:30] for god sent not his son into the world
[32:32] to condemn the world
[32:34] really
[32:35] but that the world through him
[32:38] remember brother brown said jesus didn't
[32:39] come to bring you inheritance he come to
[32:41] give you a way to get back to your
[32:43] inheritance all right
[32:45] he that believeth on him is not
[32:46] condemned
[32:50] so why should we live a condemned life
[32:53] because we have condemnation that's
[32:55] he that believeth on him is not
[32:56] condemned but he that believeth not
[32:59] is condemned already because he has not
[33:01] believed in the name of the only
[33:03] begotten
[33:04] son of god who was that the lord jesus
[33:06] christ all right and this is the
[33:08] condemnation that light is coming to the
[33:11] world and men love darkness rather than
[33:13] light
[33:14] now we're going to bring that over into
[33:15] laodicea because their deeds were evil
[33:18] for everyone that doeth evil hateth the
[33:21] life
[33:23] neither cometh to the light yes his
[33:25] deeds should be reproved
[33:28] but he that doeth truth
[33:31] cometh to the light now look
[33:33] he didn't say he that does truth is the
[33:34] light
[33:36] he that doeth truth cometh to the light
[33:39] so you can get born again but you're
[33:41] going to have to come to the message
[33:42] somewhere you're going to hear because
[33:44] that's what the end time spirit is is
[33:47] this message
[33:49] but you've got the holy spirit down
[33:51] through the ages that's been there the
[33:52] whole time
[33:53] got it
[33:56] so it's not a lot of you know we're not
[33:58] going up and down the holy ghost is the
[33:59] same in every age you're probably saying
[34:01] that's right right just what i just read
[34:03] you right here we'll finish right here
[34:05] but he that does wait a minute but
[34:06] everyone that does evil hateth the light
[34:08] neither cometh to the light yes his deed
[34:10] should be reproved but he that doeth
[34:12] truth
[34:13] cometh to the light that his deeds
[34:17] may be made manifest that they are wrong
[34:20] in
[34:21] god
[34:24] so you're going to do godly things
[34:27] that's what it says right here right
[34:28] you're going to do godly things that's
[34:29] right
[34:30] so there's your whole point everybody
[34:32] reads john 3 16. read the whole down to
[34:34] 21. all right let's go up front
[34:37] but just be studying
[34:39] read your bible brother said read your
[34:41] bible and pray i have begun starting to
[34:43] read my bible more and pray more than i
[34:45] ever have
[34:47] well i expect something from god
[34:52] sister johnny
[34:56] you may take a while
[34:58] we talk about the millennials
[35:08] that's what we did
