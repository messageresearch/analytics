fan at least because the way we've got it set it's set for a temperature and then it's got to come back up to that temperature because it's trying to cool the building but it do it all right we're going to try to get through what we're talking about today this afternoon the Lord willing I want to play uh the biggest portion of the tape called super sense and let you just hear from Brother randam as he is saying the things that we've been talking about throughout the series and so if we can do that then we'll try to have questions and answers or comments or whatever Wednesday so write them down and think on these things and we will attempt to answer the best that we can I know you already have but remember Sister Dy she is is U at home but uh still pray for her because they still don't know what's causing the the hurting inner chest they've kind of ruled out the heart the major things now they're going this week into the intestin and things to try to find if what the problem is so just remember that and I know you've already prayed for the mark Jeff remember him and the family and all of them because they say that there's not much time for him to live unless the Lord comes on the scene so we believe he will and we always believe that and thank God for I see if I got anything else uh we will be having communion foot washing this afternoon because we were not able to have it on the first Sunday all right anything else that I'm missing oh yeah we've already prayed and know about that but uh sister Gabby and brother Ryan's little baby is off the respirator and we thank God for that that's that's something you know and we pray that the Lord will get it home quick and get it everything to going all right uh Hebrews 11 Heavenly Father we thank you for the day and the hour we thank you for the testimonies that we can stand and give of your healing virtues your you're leading us and guiding us and directing us into your love and grace and your word and all of the things that we could stand all afternoon and thank you for and we just Lord thank you because you are God we ask you now that you'd come as we read your word and you'd speak to our hearts and our lives forgive our sins and Lord just let each one of us be what you want us to be because that's our desire teach us and wait to wait upon you and in doing that Lord bring us to the place that you want us to be we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen Hebrews 11 now remember there are thought you go back to the 10th chapter in verse 38 Paul is explaining there the just shall live by faith all right so he drops down a couple of verses and then he's telling you what faith is all right now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony did he please God with Rapture and Faith that's the way brother randam said it right did he please God with Rapture and Faith all right but without faith faith being the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen All right but without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now we have been quite a while endeavoring to speak upon uh faith I have a quote to reading here a little while in a little while if we get to it and uh brother Rand says that we put Faith just for like Divine Healing and and things like that and he said then it's so mistaught but what's he meaning when he's saying that we put it for healing or something even if we put it for healing and salvation you know there's a lot more to life than just healing and salvation all right there's a lot more that we need to know a whole lot more about and he said it's mistaught all right now to get to Point as we'll read the quote in a minute even if we teach it correctly but yet we only hold it to certain things we're not going to get the meaning of faith and what it really is we will just get it for whatever we want think about talk about desire you know uh when faith is what the one thing that we've been trying to get across and what did we do uh the last couple of services you take the definition of the word faith look it up let Look up the definition of the word faith and it comes out to a belief a thought a believing a Doctrine uh a concept this is over here is the Baptist Faith you know go down here to the road a little piece you'll find the Methodist Faith the Pentecostal faith you'll find you know things like that and it deals with like Assurance and all like that and those are well and wonderful but as I told you it might not mean a thing in the world to you but it was really just struck me the other night right in the middle of the night when I was thinking on these definitions of of these things and and the Lord just simply explained something to me in very simple terms we cannot take the natural reading of the word a lot of times and get the Revelation the way we need it right no matter what you have or how you have it down pat of the meaning of every word it still takes a revelation from God for that to become a reality into your heart and your life well then you simply ask as I said Paul is explaining faith that the just shall live by faith all right now well see then you would take that that just shall live by faith you would get the definition of faith and you'd go into that it's a belief a Doctrine a concept uh uh your thoughts uh what you believe and assurances and and and marvelous things would come from dealing with that word faith all right but yet when it drops down a couple of verses Paul by inspiration from God tells us in simple terms what faith is he didn't have to go through looking up all of the wording and all that's well and good I do it too I'm the one generally giving you the definitions of everything and that's good but Paul just saying simply said faith is the substance all right now then defining or how you would call it the word faith it would have all these other things relating within it but it would be not the definition that we need to understand what is faith faith is the substance so we actually told Paul Paul wrote it see he wrote what God told him God told him faith is the substance amen and how many times did Brother random use that point faith is the substance not will be hope for whatever it is the substance it's something real it is not just an imagination or a good thought that's right a Doctrine an idea it's actually this a substance so whatever you desire whether it be healing whether it be salvation whether it be materialistic things uh you know whatever if you really come down to the finality of it and look at it correctly you'll see that faith is whatever you desire that's the substance that's the substance all right so we know then that the world came into being as we read through faith we understand the world's refrain all right so then the world was framed from things that do not appear so wherever it came from to make this world you know now you're dealing with faith you went back past your doctrines your ideas your Concepts your assurances your wonderful meanings of the word and you've gone actually literally back into the mind of God because that's the only place you can go with faith all right so I hope you understand what I meant and if you that didn't hear the message I would invite you to to listen to this past Wednesday because it really really just dwell in my heart to speak about it that way that the real definition of faith is given right there in the Scripture it is not given in wordings that we must have to look up Paul had the Old Testament scriptures to look up but remember the word faith is only used two times in the Old Testament it's not an Old Testament word right it's a new testament work that's why when we finally will get over to it you'll see that it's by faith Able by faith Enoch by Faith by faith but it's true Faith to you and I I hope we can get to that point and bring it out to where we can understand all right so then the definitions of the words a lot of times will not bring us to the correct understanding but but the revelation will bring us to the original understanding or the original Faith amen all right so then I believe that we have now the as the prophet said the correct interpretation of the word of God by divine inspiration now that means to me that we can say well we've got the well you remember the Baptist man told him you know if we could ever get it down whatever word meant said we'd have it and he said no that that won't work said they had a whole lot more of the original word there in the beginning of the church then we have today because they hadn't lost their orinal translations and original wording and said they wound up with a trinity all right so then the point that I've tried to get us to look at is Faith is whatever you're asking for that substance that you're asking for which substance can be spiritual or natural see all right Revelation or or healing or whatever whatever you're asking for the word faith has got it already finished that way we're going back into the mind of God to come out with the divine inspiration is I just quoted or maybe that wording I'm just paraphrasing he said perfect interpretation by with divine inspiration it came to the prophet amen he gave us the definition of these things so no matter what Webster would say about it or who would say about it or strongs or whatever we still got to go back to the total dependence upon what God says that's right by Revelation all right now oh but we believe in the Trinity we got a revelation that has no substance right yeah but we got a lot of do a lot of Doctrine but no substance right trinities no substance hell be an eternal no substance amen can I get on down a little further am uh two Souls seven Thunder virtues perusia uh River Jordan no substance that's right all right see then it brings it down to where that if our Revelation does not what is the word coincide which means to go with or whatever to do uh with the original scripture or understanding or the prophet's message then we know for certainty where the wrongs at all right that's sorry to be that blunt but why not I think it's time to quit playing around and get down to be serious all right so we took it from that and bring in our thought and then we went into the life message being calling it the sense of faith and from that we found the prophet saying that you know the real sense of faith is greater than your senses and remember now we found that this word sense is only only used one time in the Bible all total all right so we using more modern terminologies to come down with uh C taste feel smell and here as being senses of the body we're using that part defining it down from other wordings because it's not in the Bible to where you could pick it up from to get the correct understanding all right we know for assurity as we'll read in a second that we must have the five senses of the body see taste feel smelling here all right but we know also that those five senses now listen to wording now those five senses are really more real than tangibility now that throwed you for a second so you had to think what I'm talking about right boy get your mouth closed it flew open see the five senses is greater than anything real because everything real in one way or the other came into being other than what God created you know we're talking about cars automobile planes Etc come through the five senses and really if we get time we'll read where the Prophet says that there was where we fell in the garden he said in the five senses was it no we fell into reason and memory and Imagination that's wonderful I'm glad you thought of that but just remember your memory reason conscience and affections works through your spirit which works out true into the body by what see taste feel smell and hear all right so now I'm trying to get a point to you what I was trying to get across Wednesday see we don't look at our senses as the five senses as being real we we want to get them more into imaginations you know all right but that's incorrect now you know what the prophet gave the definition one time of what he was defining he said I don't need a white shirt on he said I have one on he said that is a sign scientific fact all right now a scientific fact you say and that's why I gave it to you and I got a quote in here I get to it eventually where brother randam is talking about it and I told you you know we say when God totally delivers me of this and my arm that's cut off grows back I'll say I'm Healed no that's a sign scientific fact right if it comes back that's a scientific fact all right but to get that out of the way and important to think about then our senses are more real than you think they are what we use to contact the world and the things around us and we don't contact god with them but they're real all right now we will get to what we were talking about the sense of Faith the sense of faith is more real than caste feel smelling here are anything to be able to be proven scientific are you listening I laid it down the best way I could no education but the thought see taste feeling smelling here is more real to you than anything thing around you because it's a part of you that contacts that that is around you all right now then it being more real than a scientific fact right you see well now that was hard to swallow well okay swallow a couple of times you know get a good GL GL and let it go down that if it's a scientific fact I don't have to believe for it amen it's easy to say I'm Healed if the doctor writes me out of report and I had a growth and it's gone but faith is to stand there with the growth there and it getting worse and you say by stri some he right all right so CJ f Ming here is greater than a scientific fact all right so then faith is greater than anything c f smelling here could have to deal with or a scientific fact because the Bible says we understand the world's refrained from things that do not appear so we can have no scientific fact right you could have no se taste feeli smelling here cuz you can't see Adams right handful of them just got to get it changed correctly blow the world up all right brother R said let's get God's Adam Bomb Faith all but see going back to the original one who created now we read our Wednesday night that brother R said that Faith created the world he said we're going back to that place of thinking about how did it came into being and we see that it come into being by faith right well then truly faith is is the substance amen of what we ask for is actually a substance brother R said it's an Evidence of things not seen you remember and he said if it is a an Evidence there got to be a substance right it's all right now getting it down to where we're going to all right how much more is it to talk about faith or Revelation that it is to think about anything that we can see taste feel smell and here or anything we can prove to be a scientific fact and we get down to one thing and then I'll get on to the message so if God is still bringing individuals in to the body of Christ right then he's not through creating right now well brother D I got a quote okay let me beat you to it brother brother said it's he finished a physical creation that's true he finished a physical creation that's right but we're not a physical creation we're spiritual creation brought into a physical being so as long as the body of Christ is not complete and if there's one person that's not born again God is still creating he's the beginning of the creation of God and what did he say we are the rest of that creation amen amen hallelujah right now the main point right there is one thing we believe in spiritual multiplication we believe imparting the word imparting the word we believe that the bride of Christ has the ability to even impart eternal life but it's only through what imparting the word it's not just telling somebody they got it you can have it come and get it no it's imparting the word it's speaking the word you know that's odd then God still speak speaking well brother Dale I didn't think we were supposed to speak the word I thought it was supposed to be for brother brandham and the Lord Jesus only no think it's still happening don't you yes sir so faith is still in the being amen all right remember then the definition of faith is whatever you desire healing salvation Deliverance the substance of that is the faith that we're talking about the Revelation yeah like I invited the church to you that wasn't here to hear it U show me in the Bible where it says faith is a revelation it's not there like that he said by faith in offered by faith this by faith that we take brother brandom's message in which is correct and he says by Faith by Revelation Enoch offered to God a more excellent sacrifice the we're up to the point that we're using the prophet's definitions of the words that is I talked about to start with that Paul's definition of faith is the substance of things hopeart brother rand's definition of the word revelation is the revealed word in you and I which is the substance amen the gospel is the power of God or what under salvation and is it not true that you must first confess with your mouth and believe in your heart so if there's one more to be left to come into the body of Christ that person must confess with their mind mouth and believe with their heart and then they can come into salvation so I think we're just getting to the place to start talking about speaking the word instead of thinking about that we can't do it because see Faith then is a revelation personally revealed to you what is the new birth brother brandom about 45 Christ of mystery God revealed he says it's revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you Faith what does he say on patas Vision you can't be born again without faith there's no way to be born again without faith because that's what it is it's the birth of the word right all right now so now what we want to talk about here and I may just go part of the way in the message cut off and then pick back up this afternoon because I know won't have time enough to cover the whole notes we'll just pick up continue on then we'll play the tape let brother randam say to you what I've tried to say to you and I wish you would listen to that message over and over faith the six cense is one message but that one is a super sign a super sent excuse me TW uh 59 12 27 evening service but 19661 is Faith the six sense I wish you would listen to those over and over you know about the things that we've been talking about okay let's get on to this a little thoughts go ahead brother and pull up number one which is taken from questions and answers in 1964 and the prophet is defining to us a human being we don't don't have to go through all of the things we should understand that but we are a dual person three people in one body Spirit Soul uh outward senses you know works with one inward is the soul see he's talking about the it's not your soul but the outward senses all right and you coming down to the soul as being the actual inner being of who you are and we'll read in a minutes either Faith or doubt and he says watch what he gets to he says there's actually six senses in a human six s is in a human because it's number six and all the different things but you got C's feeli smelling here but his faith sets his destination where he's headed for Faith now what now Faith is the substance of things hope for the evidence of things you do not see taste feel smell or hear but by faith when he catches the word it sends him into a dimension so now what is the six sense it's a dimension we're going to find a lot of things that the six sense is so we're going to start out with it being a dimension that makes it so real to him till he's just as good as got it in his hand he knows it's going to happen all right God doesn't deal with you and I on the outward senses that's not made to that that's to contact the world C taste feel smelling here is to contact the world now then you got a lump in between that you want to talk about as Spirit to me memory reason conscious affections now he has to deal through caste feel smelling here but that's not the controlling Factor all right memory reason conscience and affections he has to deal through that but that is not to be the controlling factor to a Christian the inward part of us which is another dimension amen we live in what is called Life Light and matter TV's fourth this that goes into that fifth sixth you know Dimensions all right it raises us up our as the Bible says resurrected sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus it takes us to Heavenly places which is the sixth Dimension you know all right Heavenly places now we know that goes on up into a lot but all right but think about it Fai sends him into a dimension that makes it so real to him that he's just as good as got it in his hand he knows it's going to happen have you ever had that I've asked that every service and I don't do it to be little because I've tried to explain it you know L people think that i' be little by saying I've done this but you ain't never done that well now you got that in there you sure messed up in your memory reason conscience affection and you sure got your SE test F smelling ear all goofed up I tried to speak of the things that had happened to me because I know they happened amen right but I know and realize that everybody's not to have everything the same but I've tried to make it so that you would understand the simple Simplicity that God deals with you in amen keeping you from running into a car keeping you from falling off of a building or you know getting hurt the the simple things that we look at are not so simple maybe one day when we get there I've always told you that when I get there I've always said it I had two Guardian Angels because it took two of them and I'm going to have to apologize to both of them when I get there cuz I've worked them to death you but that's not a joke that's the truth all right but now listen he says on taking sides with Jesus number two there ether taking side taking God at his word now what is faith faith is the substance not just the mythical thought it's the substance of things oh far the evidence of things you do not see taste fi M here there's none of the senses declare it none of your Des senses can declare Faith right yet the six sense which is faith that can declare Faith none of your senses declares faith if you declare it with your senses is a scientific fact other than saying I believe all right but look the outside man is governed by five senses he tast FS Inside Man is governed by two senses either Faith or unbelief if you believe it it's just as real to you as if any of the natural senses of the body declare it and truly these senses of the body can be fooled but faith is absolutely infallible now all right if you believe it's just as real to you as if any of the natural senses of the body declare it now what was our definition a moment ago see taste feel smelling here is greater than tangibility you did at least shake your head maybe grinned or something about it of what we were talking about but that's all right I don't have to have your amens to help me say what I'm going to say I'm not like a come on now no I don't have to have that I learned to preach a long time ago without having to listen to people all right listen but Faith declares it Faith declares it makes it established now the only way you can know God is by Faith remember we just read he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so look at the next quote they the beginning of the of Jesus's Fame preach in 53 605 e29 now look what is faith faith is is a six sense five senses control this man God put man in five senses to contact his Earthly home you don't contact god with your five senses you know God by faith which is the six sense which is there two senses of the Soul faith and unbelief now there's not two senses in there of faith and unbelief we just read it's Faith or doubt Faith or unbelief one sense is there right amen all right and if you're possessed with faith faith is just as real much reality to you as s is have you ever had God to speak to you about something and you didn't care who argued with you about it who told you it wasn't real amen but to you knew it was real you ever had that and listen I say to you you've had that a lot of times but you don't record it faith is a simple thing a lot of times it's just a straight knowledge that comes and that's it now do you have the knowledge that has come to you by the revealed word that there's just one God or are you quoting the prophet the Bible M Grandma so old Preacher Brother Dale whoever Could you actually talk to someone without having to say brother randam say it could you explain one God without having to have a quote your revelation like I told a man at work I said he was talking to me about something that he said he saw I said okay I said what I want you to do is I want you to explain to me what you're talking about and I said now when you cross yourself I'm going to stop you because in just a moment you're going to cross yourself with your own wordings and I said' when you do I'm going to stop you well he hadn't spoke three words and I stopped him I said ou've already crossed your own self well yet you say you have a revelation well you know the way we do that but I can't explain what I see but it's revealed to me is contrary word right contrary to the word then where does it put us so you know God by faith which is the six sense that's the way you know him you don't know him by intellectual understanding look at the next one perseverance e26 62729 he's going through explaining it it has nothing to do with God at all and people really rely upon them he's talking about the senses right come on he's talking about the senses c t field here people rely upon that but you mustn't do that faith is something different faith is the six sense which you contact God you can only contact God by the six sense which is Faith he that cometh to God must believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek after him see but you see he says we use our senses and we think we got it by the senses but have you ever had him to just speak to you and tell you something amen that you and you alone knew and you and you alone have it for that part because you know how I preach it every person is an individual in the body of Christ we don't have a collective Revelation in the body of Christ God revealed himself to you but he revealed himself to me but my Revelation can't be contrary to your Revelation if we have the revelation of God that's but we can have different material now not not like well now the way brother so and so explain he explains that it a trinity but he believes in one God no no something's wrong somewhere amen but that's his way of seeing it well then his Way's wrong It Don't Fit the word come on hey folks I'm on the spot every day so I don't have to worry about it I got to tell you what I believe and I certainly don't beat around the bush you know that I just come right out and tell you that way you can make up your choice what you want to believe I don't ask you to believe it I just ask you to listen now watch we're going to get to something in a minute and I'm going to take a point right in here and just make a thought the six sense we will read in a minute where the Prophet says it's only for the Born Again believer all right okay but remember where he's living at right remember he's not in the Old Testament he's defining in a new testament form the word faith Grace salvation you only use the Old Testament as an example A typ or a Shad but before you go anywhere whatsoever listen I in no way have ever said taught thought or anything that the Old Testament people were not saved that's right they had their form of Salvation it was through the blood of bulls and goats it was through the things it was in their lives that they were expected to live and it was to that and it provided them a place to go to once they passed away which would be into the bosom of Abraham which is the faith Seed of Abraham and that's what they were called all right so then when we talk about here Enoch and them can have a sick sense remember a sinner can get a revelation that they're healed but that don't save them that's the problem all right so now as we go through a little point you listen to what we're talking about we'll continue the rest this afternoon if necessary look at number five which is taken from faith is the six sense all right our heavenly father the six sense these testimonies from the Bible that the six sense as I call it faith I was reading in Hebrews 11 of the six six sents Faith being the substance of things hope far the evidence of things that senses of the earth don't declare but we see through there how that they subdued kingdoms and stopped the mouth of lions and escaped the edge of the sword and Enoch was translated into Heaven by that six sense okayu all right we read and we'll get back to it where by faith the six sense Abel offered on to God by faith Abraham by faith six sense but we've got to Define it because if we don't then we run around with our thoughts and you're going to cross yourself in just a little bit and you're going to make your Doctrine wrong because you're going to make it try to fit your thought remember it's got to fit the whole word okay now watch stop the mouth of line Enoch was translated into Heaven by that six sense Abraham so journeyed into Strange Land and received a son after he was 100 years old six cents and Sarah's wounds was dead he considered not these things he St staggered not his promise of God through unbelief strong giving God the promise now oh God and we're supposed to be the children of Abraham what a poor excuse we are oh God wake up the sick sense in this church amongst these people tonight wake it up wake up to six cense when we see that you give that great sign to Abraham it taken place I pray that they'll see the angel of the Lord's presence tonight and we'll rely not upon their feeling upon their sight upon the word of God that made the promise and every person in here will be healed and everyone that's unsaved will be saved and all without the Holy Ghost will receive it hear me father I pray in Jesus name are you ready to receive leave your healing all of you you you going to put your six sense to work what is the six sense now it's faith and faith is the substance of things hope far the evidence of things that makes Missouri wrong you remember that in Missouri I got to see it you know Missouri there a show me state or what they call that word you have to show me you know that faith is the things that subdued kingdoms that wrought righteousness that does all kind of Miracles and signs of that six sense a six sense is it possible for a sinner to receive a revelation of his healing I believe it is brother R said prostitutes walk across the platform receive healing he said true Christians walk across and reject it why because they're not taught correctly That's the basis of what he said not taught correctly what if you tell that prostitute she's a prostitute she needs to quit being a prostitute she ain't going to get healed because you're going to condemn her all right but then think about it how can a prophet as we read later on say that only the Born Again believer has the six sense but here he says Enoch had the six cents Abraham had the six sense what's he talking about what is the uh do welcome her visitors what is he talking about faith Fai is is six cents a sinner can get a revelation now if you don't think that's right I want you to answer me one question if you think a sinner can't get a revelation and I know a lot of people don't believe that then I want to ask you one question and I'll just quit on it I won't say no more how did you get saved is that a sensible doing you was a sinner and got saved so the sinner got the Revelation he didn't get saved and then got a revelation Revelation was his salvation all right now but said the little said to the apostles perfect Faith he said the apostles he said didn't have perfect Faith he said because Jesus was walking with him he said it's hard to have perfect faith without the Holy Ghost he said because it brings it amen right then he drops down the next paragraph or right above one and we'll get back to it he said the little woman at the wh she had faith for that time all right what did what did Enoch have faith for that time which you walked off the Earth in it what did Moses have faith for that time what did Abraham had faith for that time because Jesus Christ had not been crucified and by him not being crucified the Holy Ghost was not back there in the Old Testament to give a birth you could not get the new birth in the Old Testament all right and you'd be surprised how much people don't believe that but that's all right I want to see where you got it I got some quotes this afternoon if we get time but remember Enoch had the six cents working yes sir but it was working only in the points of him of his belief and understanding it was not an inter in inter experience of the new birth because Jesus Christ has not been glorified John what is it 8:27 or something right in there because he had not been crucified how can you have the new birth without the death of the test stat as Paul said all right now use that and we'll come back to it later so we want to get to the six sense what is that six sense but R says it's faith and a faith is a revelation Revelation have you ever had a revelation amen and like I said your Revelation better fit the word you remember the guy telling brother brandham he said you know when he told him said you ought not be running around the country that lady like that said she got a bad reputation he said I want to straighten you out brother brandom and I had a vision he said immediately seen he had a dream he said but he said all that's well and good but said it won't fit the scripture amen well I I wonder did that change that man or did the man go right on believing what he wanted to you know it's hard to change people that they think they know what they're talking about right right I mean somebody thinks they know what they're talking about and you they'll spend years they have trying to find the scripture that says every tub was set on its own bottom that ain't in the scripture right that people read the Bible over and over trying to find it because it don't exist see it's our ideas that was taught Grandma mama and them believed that hell was eternal because they like to threaten you with it to try to make you line up and be a better person that's the main reason yes sir and you you know what I say around here don't you try to scare your kids and tell them that Jesus don't like you that's right at least whip them amen get to them by the bottom end of it with a hickory you get to their heads and they wind up in life and they're afraid of Jesus well I don't know where he loves me or hates me daddy said he hated me don't do it at least be man or woman enough to give them a fking the law might get us in trouble come on you're using those things and excuses now I'll get off of that but think about it faith is the six sense it's what we contact god with see the Christian then is supposed to live in a ring of the six sense we're not supposed to live in the five senses we have to because we're human beings we are you in the world come on all right but when we let them five senses rule us it'll take us down look what he says on number go to number seven try to skip a few of these this is taken from we would see Jesus 62712 in faith you know something it's just as positive as if you're sitting here it's more positive than you're sitting here it's a six sense five senses won't touch it it's a six sense five senses won't declare Faith at all it's a six sense and that six sense is the one that declares the whole armor of God and the whole armor of God is nothing that the one of the five senses will declare the whole armor of God is what love joy peace goodness meekness statue of perfect man Faith virture knowledge Temperance the armor of God if won't work through your five senses it's a dimension we talked about it's the armor of God the what love look Faith love joy peace longsuffering meekness gentleness patience who can declare that by some of your signs you can't do it it's a faith the six sense that goes out and declares it it's the substance of things hope far you don't see it you don't taste it you don't feel it you don't smell it you don't hear it you believe it we've been on faith now for so long until I'm just really getting tired of hearing so much about faith well that means you don't understand what's going on and you don't have any Revelation that no problem is any problem with me saying that back to you because I'm trying to talk about something that is more valuable to you and I than what you're thinking about what you're going to eat for lunch or what you're going to do or what it's going to happen you know it has to do with saving our soul because you can only be saved by faith come on atos Vision you can only be saved by faith you can only be saved by Revelation you can only be saved by the six sense and our problem is we live in five senses right if I can see it if I can feel it I can tell oh I'm happy but what about the six sense my brother I didn't know six sense is faith faith the substance of what you're asking for yes the six sense declares what you are five senses won't declare Faith the six sense is the one that declares see the human being is a marvelous piece of machinery and then these dumb idiots wants to say that we're fell off of a coconut tree or some kind of a tree and and to think about do you realize that that new birth that you have within you is the same God that created the world course the problem with believing and letting him speaking and you know what I've never found him to speak contrary to the word I had a great revelation and I wrote it down one time and I had about five pages wrote of notes and quotes and things and you know how I preach with a challenge to come show me I'm off the prophet's message and right in the middle of that great Revelation I had a little voice spoke and said if you do that you make your type greater than your antitype that was all it was said didn't take me through the Bible show me where I Wrong didn't take me through the prophet's quotes to show me he said if you make that he said then your type is greater than your antitype you know everybody know what it is a canoe is a Tope of a big old ocean liner boat you know this is the top that's the antip you know see in the Old Testament as I said want to go they had a lot of types and shadows which we are the Fulfillment of that types and shadows they spoke of Salvation we have that salvation type and anti type you know what I never searched to see whether there was anything right or wrong in what I done uh I burn it because no matter what was going on I knew I was wrong well I'd ask him what he meant I knew what he meant if your top is greater than your antip you're reversing the situation the little boat is a type of the big boat the big boat's not a type of the little boat you know little canoe that's right oh you know you're wrong it don't take got a lot to explain to people if you're sensible enough to listen all right let's read a couple more and then we'll just break off and go all right let's go to perseverance which is number eight paragraph 137 to 138 I know I'm jumping so faith is a substance of things hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen Faith sees what the blind people do doesn't see now Faith sees what blind people can't see now he's not talking about 2020 Vision blind right that's not what you're talking about cuz that's the sea you're talking about what blind people is some I SA Book of Revelations right open their eyes all right faith is a six sense five senses are fine as long as they don't disagree with the six five is fine as long as they disree but the six sense is Faith see it's the tough and so sure that it's real that it comes to you a substance not just an imagination it's something than you have now you may not follow me and I'm sorry I try to do the best I can but you know I'm talking about that one of these days there's going to be a bride with a positive attitude that's going to by the six sense walk off this Earth that's what I'm talking about well all I hear you talking about Faith substances and you don't know what a revelation you never had one you ever had one you know what it is you've ever been healed of anything you know what I'm talking about but if you've never been healed you don't know if you've been saved you know what I'm talking about in Salvation but if you've never been saved you don't know what I'm talking about there the six sense which is Faith it's so sure that it comes to you a substance now a substance of what anything consists of with are natural and spiritual now if Ben hen and I'm not going to argue that he done it but they said he walked out in midair one day off the platform I'm not going to argue that that took place because you see I believe in a God that can do that but because you walk out in midair doesn't mean you're saved ain't going to do with it because the the God is walking over the cold of fire I'd he rather be the one trying to walk out in midair than walking on cold to fire right and you know what he enters a law of Faith snake handlers enter a law of Faith sure a lot of them die they print that they don't never print all of the thousands that are bitten that don't die they only print the one what my brother-in-law was laughing you know sitting at his house and he was we were looking at a thing years ago and they had the snakes and the man told him he said these are not warmed up cold down or anything they I was with them when they caught them in the woods put them in the box and come here to the church with them and they just reach down in that box and pick them snakes up handed over to this woman and she just was so happy rejoicing that old snake just sitting there I do know and I've understand some tricks of the trade make sure of one thing if you ever touch a snake don't touch it with a cold hand you going to get bit I know the tricks of the trait you don't believe me just go ask Brother Don again he's not here but a lot of you knew him he would pick up a snake he told me one day he said we have any trouble at the church I'll handle the snakes I said we have any trouble at chap we you will handle the snakes don't touch it with a cold hand it will bite you that's the change of doing but that man is doing those things then after while they lit a torch up and and the guy that's done his hand like that and wrecked it over one of these big torches that goes with solder solder and iron torches my brother all life he saw anybody can do that that guy just stuck his hand over like that and the fire was running through his fingers I said don't life you wouldn't do it n either what I'm talking about people can enter a law of Faith which enters into a realm of the six sense but it's only through their being part and not an inward experience because an inward experience of the new birth and the things you don't need a snake handling proof you don't need tongues as an Evidence you don't need those things you don't need to cry or shout or amen you're a Christian all the time CU you got a substance all right let me get a couple let's get this one at least faith is a substance preached in 47 paragraph 48 now listen real close and give me your attention now the sense five senses is that right C tast Phil smelling here is that right them five senses contact the entire control excuse me the entire human body is that true CT C tast fi smelling here and there's one of them that declare Faith now you got to listen to this quote you're going to twist it there's none of them that declare Faith there's none of the senses declare faith but they're connected to your faith God faith comes by hearing all right listen faith is a six sense known to some people as you want to as mental telepathy listen or whatever you want to wish to call it many of them call it names but to me it's faith and that is in and above all five senses of the human body you see what I mean listen faith is the only direct and positive sense and it's the six sense faith is more than sight faith is more than feeling you do not feel Faith you don't taste Faith you don't smell Faith you don't see faith faith is the substance of things hope far the evidence of things not me I want one if I can find it okay get the next one then we'll quit all right this is taken from conference who preach in 1960 uh 108 E21 now that's your Earthly senses and they were not given to you to guide you but God sent the holy go Holy Spirit and he's your guide now you know what he's going to right the six sense that makes you believe things that you can't see taste feel smell and hear that six sense something that raise you up and only one class of people has that six sense that's Believers now remember Sinners can believe to a degree but he's not talking about that now because the quotes we get into this evening we'll be going more into it's only for the Born Again believer the born- again believer walks in a realm of Faith supposed too that's wherewe our trouble's at we walk by our sights we look at people by our sights we see people and we don't like what we see because of our sights but as I said the other day and I I'm just telling you it happen so you can do what you want to do if God ever lets you stand and look and back up and I did and just backed up in my whole head my eyes and everything and looked out at a person and saw them as God saw them change my thinking he said well I ain't never done that well if you believe me believe I did because I've told it 40 years ago it ain't a new doctrine come up this week all right so he says there's only one class of people that has that sick sense that's Believers Hebrews 111 says by faith and without faith is impossible to please God so God gives man faith and faith is a six sense that makes you deny anything that's contrary to his word well that's a precious treasure in the mind of God and in the heart of God what for a person to believe him how many times listen to brother R and listen to how many times brother R say God believed his own word well that's his precious treasure in the mind of God and in the heart of God that he can use that person until we get to a place that we're we're do not rely upon these five senses of contact to early home and walk by faith whether just shall live by faith what the church needs is a new birth a baptism of the Holy Spirit the touch of the six sense that sets the soul on fire for God that's touched to bring him out of the rut come on brothers that's what we need amen we need the new birth but yet how many people's going to say that they don't have the new birth you can't tell me I ain't born again not going to do it I'm going to let the word tell you you deny the word don't tell me you're born again don't talk to me about it I'm sorry too old I guess don't talk to me about that you believe it all but you don't believe this a little bit here like I said the other day all these doctrines and all these ideas and then here comes along all these people saying how wrong brother brandham is he's wrong here in the seals he's wrong there he's wrong there well tell them he was wrong on marriage and divorce and they'll fight you they'll believe that one well if he's wrong the seals I thought he said may I quote him I thought he said that marriage and divorce was revealed in the seals so he's wrong the seals but he's right over here you're no more than a muhammadan or the muhammadans will tell you or which one of it is islamics they'll tell you the Bible is right in the parts they think is right but it's wrong in the parts they don't believe I'm just probably dumb enough to believe the whole Bible let's stand together and let's just think about faith and this afternoon we'll get down to where they brother around and says only the Christian has that real sick sense CU everybody else he is is living down in a lower level that have never went on into the fullness they have received it for healings they've received it for things look at your Old Testament Saints every one of those Old Testament Saints had a faith for the time but none of it gave them a Salvation that's right come on open your Bible and read Moses went across Enoch done Elijah done but none of it talks about salvation that's right CU see there was no new birth salvation back there there was no six sense that could get within the sight of the man until the Holy Ghost came to cleanse that man but now it can be in you and I Faith the six s what do we got number 24 24 anybody have a need your alt is open D not what you have a need coming let's pray and see I believe the same God that created the world didn't die when brother Ron died I believe it became greater I don't mind saying that it became greater by the pising of the Prophet because the people got their eyes off the man got to getting into what he was talking about I'm living by fi it's coming to let believe come and let's believe let's see if God is real our sister came this morning and we had a quite a good discussion she just wants to come and repent say she's sorry for the way she's being wants to change her life move on with the lord well she wrote a big old long list which is wonderful f for the things she has done wrong I handed her the piece of paper back my wife answered it she said we all got the problems so there's nobody in the building that hasn't come through problems we don't look at the problems we look at the promise he made the promise you know I didn't ask to be a Dale my my family got me here you know the Bible says come before him boldly bless God I'm going to walk up and tell him how good I am or no no what is coming boldly it means simply to come and to realize he invited you I know I'm carnal but get it if the Queen of England invited me to come it wouldn't matter what clothes I put on it wouldn't matter my adequate of eating it wouldn't matter what I was and I would go with a pair of blue jeans on and you know that go to Ain that way she invited me she don't give me a criteria that I got to walk by she invited me I'm going I'm going my way because I'm not going to change for her you know what I mean I'd put on a suit I'd do you know what I'm talking about I'm just honest but you know God invited us to come quit trying to think how good you are might get you before God he invited you to come come on you that labor and heavy laden and I'll give you rest we can't be good enough for God to save us quick as you get rid of one thing the devil will condemn you for another thing don't worry about it he's going to do it we just say God here I am do something with me just do something with me Lord just take what I what I am and do something with it can we believe it that way can we just believe that he is God and he invited us to come just believe in it let call in we want to pray with our sister she said she's going to follow on and walk into baptismal service we'll do that one day when we can get a change but she just wants to walk on with the lord well don't worry about sister telling the Lord how bad you are like I told you this morning you wouldn't be here if it wasn't a desire in your heart so then God works on that desire you wouldn't come if they wasn't something that was pulling you guiding you so then we just walk into the house that's how simple it is not something we got to do if I told a sister to to do so many knee bends but she' just start doing them but that's not what it is it's just saying Lord here I am I'm sorry I'm sorry Lord you accept me you bring me to the

you're fine and so I'm just believe he said just come on back in December so I'm really believing you know that it'll be a low normal when I go back in December but the second testimony is as y'all all know and I y'all heard the story so I'll be real brief about that but I really believe believe when we were in Denver Colorado I think that if we'd have been 3 minutes later that plane would have left I mean I know we had the ticket but I always love the story brother brandham told about that that lady and him walking down the street I mean it happened to us I mean I really believe that plane was held for us and it was for some reason amen for us to see it but then the other testimony is um I've had a lot of ups and downs in the last seven years and I have wore a prayer cloth like 98% of the time to work I've got a prayer cloth on my desk and by the way we had the prayer cloths on us in Denver too but um right but anyway we just sat back and watched that but anyway I've wore pray cloth I mean I'd say at least 98% of the time and when brother Ryan come up here that night about his job I just set in my heart I'm believing with you Ry believing for myself and for you and I started new job next Monday amen I thank God for it see he's God and he's real he'll take care of everything we have a need of yes don't you you shall receive it's too simple right it's too simple to
