because i think we are going to read the chapter i was going to say something i come to church about uh i guess it's about two weeks ago on wednesday night and uh i walked into the church sister jill nash and said how you feeling i said terrible i'm not really feeling terrible just got this problem with my knee won't being uh i heard to straighten it out so she swept we'll just pray for we just pray about it so pray now not right then but she was praying i was praying so when i got up thursday morning i had to search to find the pain amen it's all gone all right just thank the lord for you know prayer changes things and uh it's not important who prays for you but it's just how important that prayer is to god how sincere it is that's that's what counts up you know i appreciate that crowd i appreciate prayer for everybody to pray for okay this first john the third chapter well let's pray first heavenly father we thank you for these words that we are going to read but we pray that everyone that read and hears these words lord that they become a part of their life lord and that we just always remember you love for whatsoever that we have need of because you're always with us you always care for us and you always love us and we thank you for it and ask you to bless this service this morning in jesus name we pray amen amen first verse behold what man of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should call the sons of god that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knows us not because it knew him not we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and everyone that has his hope in him purify himself even as he is pure who is whatever for sin is the transgression of the law and we know that he was manifested to take away our sin and in him is no sin who shall not whosoever little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteous who says that doeth rashness is righteous and even as he is righteousness whosoever is born of god doeth not commit sin for his seed remains in him and he cannot sin because he is born of the children of god are manifest in the children of the devil whosoever does not righteousness is not god neither him the love not his brother for this is the message that ye heard from the beginning that we should love one another god is that a wicked one and wherefore if the world hate you we know that we have to have life because whosoever hates his brother is a murderer and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him here with god receive we the love of god because he raised my father for us forever but whosoever has this world's good and saith his brother have need and shed up his vows of compassion from him how dwelleth the love of god in let us him love the word and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him forever greater than our heart and knoweth all things beloved if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence toward god and this is the commandment that we should believe on the name of the son of jesus christ and love one another as he gave us a world commandment him and in him and hereby will know that he abides in us by the spirit let's turn over to 172. 172 in this final one it will never oh oh oh i feel like shouting sometimes foreign it will never go down that's 204 in smallwood is god because today is the day of salvation

lord you administer to each heart this and father may you anoint each heart to be able to receive the word as it comes forth help me lord get myself out of the way now father minister in this service lord we place ourselves in your hands we ask for your perfect divine will in jesus name we pray and the church said amen amen you love the lord this morning amen it's good to be with you i don't know very many of you uh a few friends back there in the back brother michael and sister nina and her family we've known them for years and and uh met brother wade and sister june here four or five months ago something like that and they seem like we know them forever so uh just good to be with you this morning and and trust that something will be said that'll pick you up and encourage you and help you along life's way right hey man i won't be too long this morning uh brother terrance says i can't preach over 45 minutes so or the check bounces man if you have your bibles this morning turn with me to isaiah chapter 61. and we'll read with verse one through three the spirit of the lord is upon me because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings and to the meek he sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and the day of vengeance of our god to comfort all that mourn to appoint unto them that mourn in zion to give unto them beauty for ashes the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called trees of righteousness the planting of the lord that he might be glorified may god had his blessing you may be seated i'm going to read a few more scriptures but i want to speak this morning on being anointed for the rapture and i want to look at that word anointed there in isaiah 61 and verse 1 it actually means to to smear or to anoint or to spread and in first john 2 and 20 he says but you have an unction from the holy one and you know all things and that word unction actually means anointing right and so it means to smear and first john i'm just going to go through these scriptures quickly so i can lay this foundation move on but first john 2 and 27 says but the anointing which you have received of him abideth in you and you need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teaches you all things and his truth and is no lie even as it had taught you you shall abide in him and then first thessalonians chapter 4 and verse 15 which we know is the the rapture scripture for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep or brother adam said hinder them right for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then which we are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord now paul is speaking about two different dimensions there he's speaking about a dimension that is asleep right and he's speaking about one that is alive all right and now we know it's the order of the rapture but actually the word rapture is never used in the bible so the word rapture actually means to be snatched up or to be caught up and in second corinthians 12 and 2 paul says i knew a man in christ about 14 years ago whether in the body i cannot tell or whether out of the body i cannot kill god knoweth such and one caught up to the third heaven amen and i knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body i cannot tell god knoweth how that he was caught up in the paradise and heard unspeakable words which is not lawful from and to others right so the word that paul uses is to be caught up right and that's what we're all here for this morning is to catch the word of god that would so transform our bodies and place us in the rapture amen amen so the word there there's still a people as we'll turn to first corinthians 15 and 25 but there's still a people who will defy death who will not taste death and our last enemy death will be put under our feet and destroyed where's that water at does this sit right here i drink a lot of water man especially when i'm nervous but he says first corinthians 15 25 says for he must reign till he had put all enemies under his feet and the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death now that word destroyed there actually means to do away with to abolish to lose to deliver i like this this definition to render idle unemployed inactivate right inoperative to cause a person or a thing to have no further efficiency to deprive a force to cause to cease and to put it into right to do away with all right there's a lot of things you there a lot of definitions of that word but one thing is for sure when he puts death under his feet that we will be victorious forevermore i say what a day of what a time an hour that it is going to be right brother branham says this some glorious day the last enemy i have which is death will be trampled right under the feet as the conqueror we shall march through the city right man listen we don't welcome death right because then this is life that's glory we don't believe there's very few people you'll ever meet that want to die but that's our last enemy death and will be destroyed and listen we know sicknesses and diseases and infirmities that's part of satan's kingdom but the scripture tells us it'll be destroyed it'll be rendered idle it'll be useless it'll be abolished it'll be done away with the pain you build this morning will be done away with there'll be a time when there'll be no more pain there'll be no more sorrow there'll be no more heartaches all will be peace forevermore that's why that's why we're here this morning i have to take this off jesus so we believe in the supernatural we believe in healing we do we believe in miracles the brother testified this morning of the healing he received in his body wednesday night right tonight if we open the testimony service we'd be here all night long and it's not just here god's working everywhere in the body of christ so we have we have so many things that's happened recently at home we've had two sisters killed with cancer glory we had a sister who had cancer on her on her kidney about the size of a nickel or corner doctor gets in there and starts performing the surgery and it was gone amen all right so well those things listen when she come up for prayer that wednesday night i believe it was when inspiration hits you you just have to speak what he places right amen and just the thought come to my mind when brother branham was there and the angel of the lord said you say how to be and it'll be that way right and he said before the doctor's hands can touch her may the tumor be gone right and i just repeated what he said listen there's still power in the spoken word and i repeat it when it's had already said and believed it and when the doctor got there there's no more cancer and they told us that you also have a female cancer we need to do a complete surgery i told i told brother french i said if god healed one amen i believe he healed the other right and there was no cancer there either there was a sister just a couple of months ago she went to the hospital and said oh you've got a tumor on your right lung she had the tumor on her left bone you have a tumor on your right lung and she said well jason what am i going to do i know the lord's in my heart we're just going to pray there's power in prayer so we prayed for two days later the doctor comes in runs the exam again runs another cat scan he says well i don't have to do a third cat scan because the first cat scan showed a tumor the second one didn't show one but i know i saw one and when he examined her again there still wasn't a tube listen when god does something he don't do it halfway he does a perfect job i'll try to move on with testifying but sometimes those things build our faith that's what they're there for i i got to give this one another and then i'll move on there these things help you get into the mode for rapture right these things give you rapturing faith it's the word exactly and when a sister come up for prayer she was born with one leg shorter than the other and she comes up for prayer and she was a young lady probably i don't know 23 22 somewhere in there and she says i want you to pray that my leg grew out right well bless her heart she had a lot of faith right so i prayed a week later she comes back she goes i want you to pray that i'll have more faith come on that's it to believe right i'm on what i've asked for hey right and in one month's time her leg was the same length as the other mom well i don't believe you've done too late to tell me god don't heal god don't perform miracles god don't move in a supernatural realm he sent his word and it healed them right glory right so satan he listen he don't have a claim upon you you've been abducted sons and daughters of jesus christ you've been bought with the price he has give you the ceremony has been said over you he's placed you into the body professionally right right rims is a 1960 kinsman redeemer he said let's get down to the end of it now let's skip down the paragraph here he said first you belong to him because you you were his property for you were born in sin shaped in iniquity you come to the world speaking lies and he could not redeem it he could not read him so christ come and made man to take away every all of our sins to redeem us do you see it and the other man couldn't do it the devil couldn't die for sins because he was the very provider who made sick hallelujah see he could not he he marred his inheritance the other fellow and satan would mark his because he is the devil right he could not become another devil to take away the first devil right he could not become sin because he already was sin but christ being sinless become a center that he could redeem us hallelujah we are redeemed which means to be brought back right exactly amen glory the devil did not bring you this message he did not want you to see the end time message but he listen this message came to you on the wings of healing and restoration and listen there i will abide in amen those that are alive and remain will defy the laws of man listen we're going to be the happiest people on planet earth this morning just to know brother samuel we are a part of this group there's going to be somebody that no case there somebody will experience a body treatment somebody's gonna be there all right might as well claim it as you right now the anointing among some people i know you're you're very well taught here but among some people the anointing is not very well understood right people get a lot of misconceptions of what the anointing is and a lot of people say well boy they was anointed when they sing that song yeah really how did you know how can you tell right well you probably have a hard time telling me exactly how you knew yeah well well they moved the people so does a good auction here have a gift to get in your pocket right so does a good salesman yeah he can get up here a good motivational speaker and that i ain't but some of them can get up here and move the people and cause great big offerings that come in or whatever they're doing their great big seminars and cause everybody to sign up under a pyramid and everything else you know i didn't mean to go there but then yeah but oh man hey that guy was anointed but what was he anointed of right come on see oh well the preacher he was certainly anointed this morning he screamed and hollered and ran and sweated and oh man did you just see how much he was just that sweating and everybody just ooh and on and yeah well he stinks now that don't make him anointed listen wrestlers do the same thing they holler and they boast and they scream and they fight and and you know they sweat and they stink and that didn't make them anointed of the holy ghost so most people really don't know what the anointing is oh lord anoint me well what are you asking for what are we wanting to happen now the word anointing actually came from the eastern world and they would take an object when it was first mentioned back in history and they would anoint this object this scope or or some kind of a stone and they would set it aside and consecrate it set aside for a purpose the first time the word anointing is used is in exodus chapter 25 and verse six oil for light spices for anointing all for the sweet incense so the people were familiar with an anointing but now god is giving this a more meaningful purpose right it's not just to come out here and anoint a stone with or to anoint some stump with but he's moving this thing now in exodus 28 and 41 and thou shalt put up them upon aaron and thy brother and his sons and shall anoint them and consecrate them and sanctify them that they may minister unto me in the priest's office now it's more than a stone or a place or something like that god's telling moses to take that anointing or and anoint the ministry and sanctify them and consecrate them this is a little greater than a stone right it's a little greater than a stump somewhere anoint the priest that his sons and anoint the altar with oil right and through there the whole journey they kept that anointing oil they never get away with the anointing amen and when the prophet left god didn't do away with the anointing but he left the anointing for his people so now it had a real meaning to him right now they could look and they could see the sons of aaron and they could see aaron see how they were anointed and see all the things there god's wanting to choose a king one day you know for israel you know so he goes to this prophet samuel the people that showed you know the people wanted to saw saw backslides watch now you're still anointed you're not sure backslidden king still annoying right man just because that didn't take the anointing right exactly he was still anointed by the prophet right but god is changing helen says i i need another king i need somebody else to be anointed i need somebody that'll consecrate yourself somebody that'll sanctify themselves somebody that'll keep the word true so now he tells samuel go down to the house of jesse and take the horn which is a power and take the anointing oh which is the spirit yeah with you down there you're going down to anoint a new king now it didn't just fall away samuel thought it would well i'll go down here and i'll pour it up on the first sun that comes out cause he's the best looking and he's the tallest and he's the toughest and he's got big muscles like brother zach god didn't choose him not talking about brother zach but god didn't choose the person second son comes up because that didn't heal me well you have to realize what's happening here there is a transfer taking place right now the prophet starts pouring at all when he finally gets down to david and he says well do you have another one here we got a little boy he's out here in the field he's a little he ain't very tough he has curly hair and all these different things the prophet describes of him and he says well go get it and when he comes into the presence of the prophet the lord says that's him anoint him glory so now he's beginning to there's things happening here he's now god has chosen a person a specific person from a specific household and i want you to anoint him saying it was all god's predestinated plan to begin with right right you anoint him you pour the hole upon him right listen god's not going to send his messenger and anoint the wrong people right glory god wasn't going to send samuel he was going to choose the first one right god wasn't going to send you a messenger in this day and he anointed the the pentecostals with it only he wasn't going to send you a messenger and go anoint the catholics with it but he called out a people out of every walk of life and every faith that there was and he anointed them with this anointed word amen so now david is taking on a different fulfillment in life now he's anointed king right yet he's not placed as king right but he's anointed king right and in the eyes of god he's already done it right because god cannot take back what he says and if god chose him god will keep him right right you know that's where i think david he must have kind of lost sight sometimes during his life of what he was really anointed for um or he'd never been scared of saul right you know you can throw your javelin at me all you want i'm the anointed right i can't be killed right hey how many times do we go through life and hey you are the anointed bride right exactly and you go through life and the devil begins throwing things in your way through sickness action he throws cancer at you and he throws all these obstacles marriage problems and whatever else at you and you wonder what am i going to do but you have forgotten little bride that you have been anointed for the hour you're annoyed for this time and there ain't no devil can take your life there ain't no devil can put anything upon you that god doesn't alive amen so he picks a specific child he didn't look on him for his countenance saul was anointed he's chosen other people sure now up to this point we've moved along we come from a a stump up to a priesthood now up to a kingly position and the hebrews believed that the deity that the prophet represented when poured that all about on yeah upon that king there was a transfer that took place from the deity to the king right exactly and when the king poured out his oil upon you right there was a transfer took place and he took a part of himself and he poured part of that deity upon you that when you speak the word of god it's the same as deity speaking the prophet said amen amen so you have a right to believe that everything you speak under his word has to come to pass amen you have to recognize who you are right you have been anointed minister brother back toward home he said 25 years ago he's preaching in phoenix and he's preaching at a big meeting there's about 1500 people there he's preaching on pretty much knowing your authority and knowing who you were and how to speak to the enemy he said at the end of the service woman stood up back over in the back corner and started screaming and she was screaming just the hideous screaming you know just going down and just making grunting noises and growling noises and he said 25 pictures behind me thought she was in the spirit yeah and she come down the middle island he thought you know what what am i going to do right he said but i didn't want these other guys to know that i didn't know what i was going to do i just got through preaching on knowing who you was ignoring your authority and that you have the power to bind the devil right so he said i just stepped down there in the front matter he said one of these preachers just staring he said later asking what was he doing so i've never seen a devil cast out like that so i want to watch yeah and he said i looked at her she comes up she's bowing down just you know just going through her little rant and he said that's a catholic spirit yeah oh my he said i didn't know she was a member of one of these brothers congregations yeah oh my it really didn't matter because that's a catholic spirit and because you have defied the spirit of the living god come out of her and he said when he said that he said a wind come down through that building and her eyes that were wild went back to being normal and healings began happening all over the whole building listen those things are real spirits are real but so is the anointed word of god really when it comes to anoint the pride in this last night there will be a people who will be an invincible army glory so now the transferal of holiness and righteousness and virtue and a special endowment by the holy spirit and if you have the right representation representative anoint you and that representative come to the right people because samuel didn't come to their own person come to the right person exactly and it all begins to fall in line right you begin to see life changed you'll begin to see the holy ghost take a hold of people and begin to cut off the things of the world and begin to shake off every unclean thing and people become dedicated to the word of god they fall in love with jesus christ i like how one brother says you don't need all your marriage seminars that the world has given out here what you need is the holy ghost and the holy ghost can take care of most anything you'd ever need amen exactly you know when the anointing came it didn't mean a whole lot to the miracle seekers all right didn't have an effect upon them but when it comes to the chosen one right and the prophet was sent to a certain house to a certain person of the house and now this anointing had been entrusted to a certain individual come on listen it was greater now than it had been but it wasn't just going to stay there there was going to come one greater than what david was that was going to have a greater anointing than david ever had so yeah now it's moving to a greater time and i was preaching on some things back home recently and we went through the five comings of elijah and down through some other things during the scripture and the death and or the the birth and the burial and the crucifixion and the resurrection and the taking of the book because i began to look at that each time he came he got greater right amen every time this anointing it was just gonna get a little greater and a little greater hey first coming of elijah was great but when he lies you came he did twice the miracles right when john the baptist came look at his men and he introduced the messiah right and then during this last the sport elijah ministry came look at the miracles it done right man look at the things and watch what happens when it goes back to israel and 144 thousand are born in one day right amen you talk about a powerful word look at the blood it gets stronger and stronger and stronger and it will never lose its power so the anointing gets stronger and now the anointed one was coming like the people had never seen before and they they misunderstood it before they were certain to misunderstand this one nominations of that day misunderstood him he's born the guy's born illegitimate yeah everything else and you know jesus brother says the greatest anointing there ever was was upon jesus why people are so tossed about brother brown says this some people get the wrong impression of what the anointing is right do you ever think of that he said when was the greatest anointing ever given to anyone and what did they do when they had the anointing right the greatest anointing was ever given to anyone was jesus christ we have the spirit by measure he had it without mention one day he entered the temple and he picked up the scroll and he read part of the same scripture that we read to begin with the spirit of the lord god is upon me for he hath anointed me to preach the acceptable year to bind up the broken heart is the heal the sick give sight to the blind now we would think if such an anointing was on him that he'd been prophesied 800 years before that it would come there he was with that type of anointing the full blessing the anointing of the lord upon him we would want to run all over the building scream and holler the bible said he laid down the scroll right and sat down amen and precious words proceeded from his mouth that's what he'd done under the anointing right the anointing is not emotions that people get emotional there's nothing wrong with it amen but that's not the anointing the anointing is supreme power in control like knowing exactly what and how and that's what's here listen if it was there then he still hebrews 13 8 and that anointing that supreme power in control is now here it's what's with the bride today glory amen if you took the anointing on jesus to preach and surely it takes the anointing on us to preach within the faith right no minister one time's in i yeah and he's backslidden yeah whatever else has nothing to do with your talent of being able to deliver words has nothing to do with that right it has to do with consecrating and sanctifying and dedicating yourself to the word of god and being in prayer with god and letting the power of the holy ghost come upon you and give you the thing that the people has needed listen it would be easy to get through well today i'm gonna teach on first john and i just go through all that i just break it down and break it down and break it down but if it didn't come to me by inspiration how's it ever going to inspire you right right right amen but i just pick up a church age book and i just start well working today because i've worked so hard this week we're just gonna go through the church age book and that didn't come inspired to me to go through the church milk what good is it gonna do you right so it takes the anointing every time regardless what we think if you're not of europe here and you're not anointed what good is it going to do the people right so we now have the messiah which means the anointed one and at the day that john baptized him jesus at the river one of the greatest events that had ever taken place the land would have been said the meekest of the hall and the creator creatures of the earth and the dove the meekest of all the fowls of heaven and when the dove came down and john saw jesus and said behold the lamb of god that takes away the sins of the world amen oh brother jason he had to grow into being god he was the word born amen and made flesh amen amen behold the lamb of god that takes away the sins of the world and john said i bear record seeing the spirit of god like a dove coming down out of heaven and abiding on him and the dove and the lamb uniting together listen he was the messiah the anointed one the kingly one he was born emanuel right well brother brown had to mature into being a prophet well i'll agree god showed him more things as he went on time okay but he was born prophets are born prophets you gift in his life it was there before the foundation of the world and the very second he was born he was a prophet so messiah was the anointed one right brother brown talks about the messiah sign some 500 and something times so i'm not going to read all the quotes or i won't get done 45 minutes i told him i'd get him back from last night so while jesus was sitting there alone in jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he says nobody around there was a lady come out of the city went to draw some water she was a samaritan yeah and the samaritans have do you have gentile kind of a crossbreed and there was there was very much what at one another throats at that day so while jesus was sitting there the woman she come to him and he says woman give me a drink and she says it's not customary that i give you a drink jesus tells her but if you knew who you was talking to you would ask me for a drink and i'd bring you water that you didn't know where it even come from you come to draw here of natural water but the water i'm going to give you is water of eternal life now after a while he said she sits there and well the well's deep i've got nothing to draw with and he says she says when when do you get this water but our father's worshipped in this mountain and you say that jerusalem meant up to worship god and he said their time is coming and now is right when men need a worship hero or at jerusalem and the conversation went on and after a while program 44 after a while i explained to you what he was talking talk to her and i will now he was trying to catch her spirit and as soon as he found out where her trouble was taking to her a long enough time to catch her spirit and see where the trouble was the father had told him to go up there but he didn't know what was going to happen when he got there the only thing he knew just go there and talk to a woman that's what the vision has showed him yeah but when he got to go and talk to this woman he found out where her trouble was and he said go get your husband yeah yeah i don't i don't have a husband well we probably would have said she lied yeah the first one was her husband yeah jesus says you've told the truth you had five and the one you're living with now is not even yours and she said listen now she knew what the anointing would do she had been taught something she knew what the anointing would do when it come upon a person because they were looking for this kind of person to come and she says sir i perceive that you are a prophet amen brother brethren says are you ready yeah this might shock you real hard sir i perceive you're a prophet we know that when messiah cometh the anointed one cometh he will tell us these things right but she didn't know who he was and what is the sign of messiah then those words see she said you must be a prophet and i know when messiah cometh we know we samaritans we've been taught to watch the messiah because these signs would be on the messiah and when messiah cometh he will do these things but she couldn't understand who he was and he said i am he that speaks to you so here's the anointing standing in front of her right and she dropped her water pot right i found this part i find this really fascinating and she runs into the city and she didn't tell nobody prophet come on this man just told me listen she goes he told me all that i ever done right and he told her one thing according to the scripture it's only a record of exactly right you're living with another man it's not your husband her life became an open book man listen she knew that if he could tell her how many husbands she had he knew everything else about her life she listen she knew she was in the presence of the anointed one and when you ever get in his presence you will never be the same again he changes you from the old man to a new man and places his spirit in you glory abraham experienced it he was given that sign there he is sitting one day sitting in the door of the tent and he looks up and he sees three men walking and he says my lord right yeah brother said he had a revelation right right my lord and the lord sits down elohim sits down with him and begins talking abraham i gave you a promise i've come to visit you yeah you and sarah are fixing to have a baby sarah done tried to fulfill this through through the bonds woman right but now she has been identified right no it's not anybody else it's not your bonds woman it's sarah your wife right she's the one that's gonna bring forth the child and sarah's sitting in a tip behind him she laughs and that will come says why did she laugh that's it she laughed at her heart yeah but the anointed one was there amen to know the very secrets of the heart and he discerned what was behind him listen church we have the greatest message that's ever came to planet earth right and we let the book set on the shelves and we let 1206 tapes up there and we don't listen to them like we ought to listen to and we let them collect dust we're going to be held accountable for not digging in the word exactly right all the people at home i said you know what some of you just stare at me like i've come up with something from outer space i preach and bring out things about nice looking yeah well if you would read and pray glory and listen right but when the preacher preaches you say amen brother samuel amen brother that's what the prophet said that's what the scripture says that's thus said the lord and you can put everything behind that but too many times we lay it all upon the preacher yeah right preacher get anointed come out preach me happy yeah preach me into rapture that's what your job is yeah but you got a job you got a job to prepare your vessel for the anointed word when it comes out it's just not the preacher's job it's the people's giants everybody has to work together to make yourself work amen and then we have to depend on god to come by right and bless it exactly we've had that same messiah sign in this day right we're a little kentuckian seventh grade educated could walk to a platform turn his back right tell them their names right what they're thinking where they live you live in such and such address chicago illinois yes i don't i don't know future homie calls out a lady in our church and he goes mrs alexander you have a thyroid condition yes but hallelujah you have a thyroid condition and he looked at her and he said and you can't have any more children something about a thing but thus saith the lord you live at a certain address in chicago illinois you're here she had three more children i go to church with us she loves church and her husband later listens to that tape and he goes we didn't live there and we lived over here already and sister murder said no we didn't we moved the next week see god don't make any mistakes all right listen well and there's another ah he missed that address yeah and then they said oh no i moved yeah exactly the angel of the lord knew exactly where they lived listen he knows where you live at this morning and he knows what your needs are this morning he knows what the needs and all of her bodies are this morning and he is more than able this morning to come through the anointed word by the preaching of the word it cast out devils and he sent his word and he healed the people amen listen if anybody ought to believe in a rapture and a body change it ought to be you all right listen when you could see a man it's the abraham sitting there and listen you could read the bible and you could see where abraham was 90 years old and sarah was 70 years old or whatever he was and they're down here and he goes down to gear right and the king fall in love with this old lady right nothing against you hillary's sister and i'll stop right there so i don't great but he fell in love yeah what's this old lady yeah this grandma brother been said and she really wasn't even a grandma yet right right yeah potentially it was coming right and the king falls in love with her and abraham lies and says he's going to come after you you tell him you're my sister well she was his half sister but she's also his wife well brother is just a half life well it was the lie right tell them i'm not here all right that was a lie right exactly he gets out here and and the king now goes to sleep that night and you say whoa boy tomorrow i'm going to get me a young bride he didn't know she's 90 years old yeah see you never would have picked that up on your own right had not a messenger came and told you that they had a body change and that's what you are going to experience you're going to get the same anointed word that came the anointed word came to abraham changed his body but the only words come to you and it will change your body right and the king's land in his bed chamber and the lord visits him and says you're good as a dead man right lord you know the integrity of my heart he goes yeah i do that's why i come to talk to you unless you give back abraham his wife well lord you know he told me it was his sister i know but now to top it all off you need to have that prophet pray for you or you're going to lose your kingdom and when it comes to the cross at calvary and got over into the book of hebrews that lie was not held in his name the sins wasn't held against rahab it wasn't held against the saints of all it crossed through the blood right exactly god couldn't hold it against him amen we said it's all right for us to lie that ain't what i said all right this word will change your body this word will give you what you have now listen messiah didn't come to the to the pharisees and the sadducees of that day and he didn't come to all the great big denominations they rejected the word made flesh and soul day to today reject the word that's been made flesh i know there's people that believe brother ryden was god oh yeah we don't believe that we do believe that it was the same in every detail except the corporate body that gift came down that anointing came down listen and it chose a specific individual from a specific family right to be the forthcoming of elijah why didn't god choose somebody that was highly intellectual and highly educated yeah cause he needed somebody that could speak like us right that's right he'll be late right of course from the south brother and goes to new york he needs an interpreter almost yeah right and here we are down here with his and hanks and canks and tanks and and feather tick bands or feather straw whatever the beds were and all these different sayings you can relate to those things and god sent him in your own language and you didn't need an interpreter to understand it but god chose you right now out of seven billion people this morning he chose a little group here in georgia to be part of his wife that i could turn down with these people the anointed word of god set them on fire and get them ready for a rapture all right amen through the revealing of the word i will let them see that the son of man has come in this hour and i have revealed myself through him amen and i've come down and yes there's another ones and false anointed ones yes brother preaches the message of northern ones at the end time and when you listen to that message you might be a buzzard or you might be an eagle right but you'll know which one you are when you get through listening exactly see we look at things sometimes in a time element and a prophet looks at things not in time like we look at him right two years before brother brown ever preached that message he asked brother bischo one time he said do you ever get my tape on a normal one's at the end that was in 1963 yeah and preach it to 65 right but let me tell you when god begins delivering exactly an anointing word brother said i was out there in that desert and those mysteries the revelations were coming so fast i couldn't even keep up with all right well i think projection we gotta have we're gonna have our systematic rules and and we gotta have everything just perfect we have to have two songs one special and everything's gotta be just got the eyes yeah listen we i believe in church order but brother branham also said that sometimes we need to get out of church order long enough to get saved oh you can church order a church to death to where there is no life there is no movement and that's not what the prophet intended it to be to touch the movement of the spirit no he put it in order so the spirit couldn't believe amen bless him because one would want a testimony and testify and before you know it there's no room for the word well the main attraction is the word amen have one brother tell me he said well we normally have more than one special sometimes they say more than two songs yeah but he said in about 30 minutes or a half hour right so if you can sing ten songs in a half an hour you can do it listen it's got to be this kind of music before church well read all the quote or something like that yeah yeah i know you don't have those problems here what we do in arkansas because we're pretty human back there and we're known i've been told since i've been here our heart is known as the legal estate you've heard that before where i go you're from fort hardy oh the homer long board said i don't pull two runs at fort hardy and i ain't going back it ain't that way there anymore so man you come visit us but we do believe there's been a message sitting there and we do believe that he alone had the infallibility of the word and we do believe that that message that has been preached and been given a life for will put us in a rapture and that anointed word will prepare our lives our thinking our ways for the body change and that's what we're here for this morning lord shuts my heart if there's anything in there that's not like your word circumcise that out of me that's foreign put your word down in there god give me what i have needle to make this rapture right right amen listen i felt like i was anointed before that's not what it's about is there supreme power in control in your life does he have the supreme power yeah is he your fault is he your breath is he your understanding is he the word made flesh to you amen that's where it has to come to the anointing is to confirm the word and when he came listen he didn't take his picture with me yeah but he chose a set aside vessel i told one one brother said well everything's covered under the atonement i said all right why did brother brown i believe the atonement covers our sins but why did brother branham have to keep his gift pure yeah why couldn't he smoke right right why couldn't he drink right why couldn't he run with wood because i have a work right a set aside service a place that has to be consecrated a place that has to be sanctified listen that the word can come through listen and he's not battling all these thoughts that he had in his life well that was a broken house and i was that no he had enough demon powers to battle right he'd battle those demons when he went home at night and he would constantly in his mind the demons would never torment me but yet there that anointing would still yet be upon him and many nights he would walk down the street down through jeffersonville swinging his coat over his head walking down the street speaking in tongues they haven't forbid if that happened today we all got pentecostal well you know they crucify you brother yeah away well let me tell you this word is a perfect word right amen and there ain't hey listen he didn't add something here in 47 and delete it in 65 right right and if he come up with something else god showed me more and he used to preach a white horse rider as christ but when the angel the lord i would have made a terrible mistake but about noon today he came in the room and he showed me what the revelation of that first seal was where i would have made a terrible mistake let me tell you he is still here and there's many times you would have made a terrible mistake but because you're living under that anointed word for your hour the word corrected you and talked to you before you made a mistake reach down his hand for you picked you up out of sin caught you before you fell into temptation right thank you jesus cut you the longer of god he reached down his hand glory and he picked you up right and you were sick and body and he came by right and you were lost in sin and he came by and whatever you had need of he's even here this morning right now musicians come he's here this morning to give you what you have amen he's still a healer he's still a savior all right he's still the holy ghost giver amen listen he don't never change his word don't ever change it's men that changes but i say this morning oh god would you just let lord the anointed word just saturate me this morning let it permeate my heart this lord in the lord i have a need in my body this morning i have a need of the holy ghost i have need of a closer one i have need of healing let's stand this morning he is here this morning to give you what you have needed if thou canst believe all things are possible glory it depends on your faith this morning yes yes we come here is he became i need a feeling is bring power in control me enjoy the message the anointing supreme power in control and doesn't do away with running and screaming and hollering does it nope but when you got it in control you know how to scream and holler you know what you're screaming and hollering about yeah right there's nothing wrong with being emotional as long as your emotional decline that would work probably said you can go up shout all you want to i said make sure when you come back down you walk straight right right why because there's the anointing right it's christ in you the hope of god make sure you tell our brother how much you appreciate it anybody have a need oh again foreign foreign thank you is thank you oh we are and we are family
