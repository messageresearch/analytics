========================================

get away from Genesis this morning and simply the last time we were talking about bacon capital punishment and judgment and everything I whole day going into the new testament toggled up to have the bride judges and the scripture made in Matthew 7 one judge not that ye be not judged and just kind of divide that up and go off the different pieces and look at all the different ways it pleased to be judged you know last time we're talking about taking vengeance and castle of punishment and I don't know if y'all heard but it was a sister in north carolina and joe canada send me a message that she had been shocked if he can't play her in church for four years or hype with orbitz us and they had a little tired shopping fella came in and asked for money she gave the money and he just turn around a shot she was a real good friend with brother Spencer so remember that family that's things like that are kind of hard to the time the thing about you but remember we have promised it if you missed a fee in one of god's little ones it's better for millstone running in and cast into the sea um so less yall already turn to Matthew 7 11 but instead of turning that lets trying to press for what first Corinthians 6 1 which is a scripture about home taking one another to you too long first Corinthians 6 longer dare you know you having a matter against another get along for the unjust and not before the Saints do you not know that the st. George is the world if the world should be judged by you are you a worthy to judge the smallest match no you know that we shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this life and then you have judgments of things pertaining to this life said there to judge you at least the stand in the church because it'd be better for the least esteem in the church to judge you there to take it before the heathens of the world put it into it if you have any disagreements over things that otherwise you could take to court to be better for the very least in the church JG therefore even the judge I speak to your shame is it so that there is not a wise men among no not one that shall be able to judge when his brother but brother go with the law with brother and that before the unbelievers now therefore there is utterly a fall among you because you get a long one with another why do you not rather take Rome why do you not rather suffer yourselves to breathe to be defrauded see you can see that in the new and a new covenant that believer has the right to judge less so so now let's turn to Matthew 71 get ready to turn to a lot of scriptures but sometimes things if you take just one verse it's hard to understand you've got to read it in context and look at almost every time when there's a scripture in the Bible it's hard to understand if you just expand your reading out a few verses and look at the context it becomes really clear what just be able to talk about 1971 if you take this first one by self judge not that ye be not judged well you could interpret that don't judge it all then you know like what her in the morning the word when we're about to go out my wife asked me if is her direct dress appropriate is a it's her dress too tight or Israel clothes not right and I'm judging that when we come into the house of the Lord that you know the Deaconess have to judge somebody's make the kids of misbehaving or what not we we're judging if you don't if you don't judge it all over the preacher wouldn't even have really anything to preach about so of course we're judging so let's you got to take this whole package of the from verse 12 verse five to really understand the scripture verse versus 224 kind of clarify and verse five ties it all together explains the real intent so let's read at all judge not that ye be not judged for with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged and with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again and won't be hold us without a look that is in my consider is not the beam that is in that only I i I'm sure everybody understands that expression it's a way of saying if your if your brothers if you're trying to fix but tell you brother get that loss pick out of your eye but you got a great big old something that you write it doesn't make any sense for you to try to help your road get that thing out of his eye or how well they'll say to that brother let me pull out the mote out of thine eyes behold a beam is in thine own eye thou hypocrite first cast out the beam out of thine own eye and then shall that clearly see that this is the see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye so that's the summation at first you make sure that you don't have a problem you can help your brother if he's got a problem with adultery or something like that is like that if you don't have the same problem get it out of your life first then you can begin again that's what a deacon is supposed to have his family or because how can I tell somebody to keep your kids a lot of my kids are in my way and I hope my kids are barking up let's see oh let's go to the first grade is in 215 there's so many different ways that to work judges used in the New Testament and we're going to go to go through several level and look at how you should not judge and how you should use no but this one that one we're all for me you were either this spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself had judged of no man for whom have known the mind of the Lord that he instruction but we have the mind of Christ if you have the mind of Christ you got you know that in three last night for chapter in the church age book if you want to know that evidence of Allah goes well Brandon was using the Isaiah 54 13 and all that children shall be taller the Lord agree shall be the piece of our children because we need have the Holy Ghost God becomes Java brain state she remembers and teaches you that's why we can we have the Holy Ghost bill believer understand has understanding and if you don't have understanding then you can listen to what holy Joe still believe our sins and the way to conduct themselves and have no understanding all how can somebody this outside of Christ to understand and believer they look at us and think that we're we're odd and strange and like you you read for example John 11 it says the word with god and the word will God if you don't have one goes that's just you'll be on the understanding so I sent these notes to brother joke this morning through on a website and other I had a list of my notes if you want to download it later of all the sum up some scriptures that have different ways that the word does is used in first grade I'll turn into it but first Corinthians it is used to weigh carefully in form an opinion in Luke 743 it's used to infer or draw conclusions and John 1831 is used to put on the trial and enrollment 14-3 is used to despise as John 751 that was to condemn but let's take a look at the context of Matthew 7 this this is where the Sermon on the Mount and what Jesus is trying to get across is that they behavior of a Christian it's supposed to be radically different from the Jews oh he said except your righteousness cellex-c the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees and the Pharisees early early I told you I are going to eternal up let's go to Luke 18 9 you know the same story is and matthew and luke and so even though we're switching to a different book it's this is earlier in the on our team Luke 18 days and he's fake his parole under certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despite dillards I sue me that's how he's referring to about the Pharisees the Pharisees regarded themselves some highly and they had complete contempt for anybody that wasn't like them they passed judgment upon everybody else while they were blind on their own faults oh let's turn to Romans to 221 now they're force teaches to another teacher still not myself dr. preaches a man should not steal the stuff still now let's say its demands do not commit adultery just not commit adultery down at a Forest idle just alchemists oculus now they make a stop boast of the law through breaking along just owners that God for the name of God is blasting among the Gentiles through you because it is written and it so he he's just continuing the thought don't judge hypocritically and so then I want to look at the different categories of judging and how you should not do it first of all there's a public judgment that a sleazy a circle judgment where the preacher is trying to poker and judges by marching scene and rebuke you people in priority if it's necessary and you know like this this series of always doing his brothers judgment upon our family higher and we should we should really take the heart I really enjoy thats been a blessing to me and it's better to be judged by a certain of God that to be judged by God because then if your life is not ordering a you go and take communion then bus while many are sick and sleep my money you know theme so it's actually a blessing to be judged by the certainly are Oh in the house of God where desma Starks and brother Brennan talked about the case bunny as a type of church because um they care about leading said there was a well that had seven branches well that and that type to the well the water of life that goes out into the the churches where we receive judgment he said how can I overcome but when we come here we are here for one specific purpose greater than Solomon is here he said they followed him today come to a place called Kadesh Barnea the judgment seat of the world there was one great spring with several little tributaries which we can go in at each other we have time next when one that was where the waters of life goods from the throne to the churches and so forth but it was the judgment and judgment begins at the house of God and you know what happened to catch party and then we're presented with a choice and we're presented a choice here but a choice when we hear the word to believe it for to turn it away to accept it or to segment the promises of God are not truth PVE him God don't entertain people even beauty judgment begins at the house of God when it comes to the time that the church has to have soup suppers and dances and bunker games and all kinds of nonsense of Rome shell to visit preacher God have mercy on that church and that scripture is in first Peter 460 I'll just read it yeah if any man suffered as a Christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify God but the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of God and if it first begin at us what shall the end of them that are being what shall be the end of them that they not think I from God the second Timothy 4 14 he says Paul said I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ he shall judge the quick and the dead as his appearing and his kingdom preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine but the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lusts they shall heap to themselves teachers having itching years now the next time I'm judgment is civil government let's turn to Romans 13 ah let every soul be subject unto the higher power well there is no power but of God the powers that be are ordained of God this is a good reason not to be worried about all the elections and thanking comfy if you you know if you started my job and go to my balls and they go up to the mayor and go up to the keep going pump up eventually going to get to God because God is over everything and I kind of like to say I vote on my heat because you know well that if I keep talking about that I guess any local though whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation for rulers are not a terror to good works for to the yield but I'll they're not be afraid of the power do that which is good and I shall have prayed of the same for he is the minister of God me for good but if I do that which is evil be afraid for he beareth not the sword in vain God a revenger to execute wrath upon him that do with evil rulers are not a tear in good works but to the evil God sets them and gives them power of us lucky like you compound would have any power and what I'm giving you by God right so I'm not going to talk about that very much because of what we're talking about I just wanted to briefly mention it what we're talking about it and Matthew judge not that you do not judge let's now let's go to private judgment where one man in a Christian manner represents another for his sins was turned to Leviticus 19 7 EG Oh next week 17 I shall not hate thy brethren in neihardt now shot in any wise rebuke that neighbor and not suffer sin upon proverbs 27 this is one that that sting a little bit open rebuke is better than secret love okay that's that's really too sure if I have a problem off our I brother somebody's telling let's read the next one two faithful are the ones that are playing but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful this is kind of a crass way to explain but I had when I was in high school while saying I played the trumpet in a band I had a little friend next to me that we were on every time you have I'd have something in my nose pointed out and she liked this thing just be glad it with your friend that is a crass way he's playing much but it's better for one of your friends to point a fallout then if it's where you see my point oh the next the next little topic is a waste that we should not judge we should not judge we're talking about judging not that you be not judged don't judge outside of your side of your business I'll just read this because these are first set Thessalonians 4 11 that you studied to be quiet and to do your own business and to work with your own hands as we commanded you the first Peter for 15 but let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an evil to work or as a busybody another matters there we all know the example of getting on the telephone and judging want to know to our friends and it's right that all that does is it blew up bitterness with gossip yes oh don't judge presumptuously that's a passing judgment on most of another without without any of us that's what we do a lot of time on the phone yes just presumptuously let's go Romans 14 for Oh who are they all that judgest another man servant to his own master he standeth or palo tal be home for God's they're doing Houston this is just talking about let's go let's go up to verse 43 let splitting not let not him that Edith describes him that either not and let not him what he is not judge him that yet for God has received him and a good example explain this is this is may be controversial but the Christmas tree somebody has a Christmas tree if someone wants to have a Christmas tree don't do it week and images code they got a Christmas tree somebody doesn't want to have a Christmas tree don't condemn them go they don't have good tree because we're all serving God throughout it just another main service in his own mastery standards or false yeah he shall be holding up for god is able to make you stain these peas limit forgot don't judge him over something like that now I'll make a better example is and joke one that don't turn I was reading in Joe 192 level where the devil presumptuously a huge job of fearing God for personal gain not its enclosure this sickness to the lore that said dust joke fear of God for no that's not now made in hays about him in about his house and about all that he has on every side thou has blessed the work of his hands and his substance is increased in the land but put forth idea now touch all that he hath and he will curse thee to thy face police saying judges this in it for personal gain but wasn't it personal gains in it for love he loved God hypocritically don't judge a few yourself or guilty the Romans too I think we already read this I'll just read it therefore that already excusable old man who square without art that judges for wearing our judges to another now condemn us i sell for thou that judgest doest the same things David the sea and I the example I like to use this is at work we always kind of get kicked out people at benefit in up I work at a law firm and everyone's awesome i was absolutely blew their top and rant rave and everything that is a very good sign that they themselves i'm not doing their work when somebody starts pointing fingers everybody else it is so true if they got a three point back to them and we we kind of get a kick out of that work everybody here that's been very true therefore without RX inexcusable oh man who sort without our that judge for wearing not just another doctor him as myself without that judges do us the same things and remember enough historian second saying or david accused the rich man Nathan the Prophet came to him and he said he's told the story or the rich man stole the poor man's land which was Bathsheba and David in realized and David said he needs to be punished for that when he himself more air with it Nathan wasn't telling story about land David David was guilty of a much greater sin than just later he was pointing fingers he don't do that make full proof performance assuming the worse than someone Genesis 11 5 the Lord came down to see the tire that the people built the Tower of Babel he came down himself and justice 18-21 he said I will do down now Sodom and Gomorrah because he wanted to see John 724 says judge not according to the appearance but judge righteous judgment because sometimes a lot of times things on the outside or not I know you can judge somebody that you think is doing wrong while they might be it's been in there knocks praying for you proverbs 18 he's an answer is a matter before you hear that it is all I had shame unto him and then the last one is uh unwarrantable judgment because in gods were there some things that are commended and there's some things that are condemned oh there's another thing there's another there's a lot of things that aren't there's nothing really said about them like Christmas trees oh please yes t 7 16 it says be not a righteous / much needed to make thyself over wise why should establish destroy thyself and you know people people make up I hope that's done a fitting and one of other people that they make a great rules are for the children don't play any games with dice or it's a sin to play a board game with dice or to have a board game of cards and didn't make all these extra rules there aren't really there's nothing really in the model that it's kind of unwarranted judgment and then you judge up people because they play a board game with dice and center they're not a Christian or whatever but going back to the other or if you want if you feel it in your heart that you shouldn't play a board game with dice if you believe in that scene and you do it anyway you know about says that sin to you if you do it without faith we're almost 14 7 for the kingdom of God is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy and Allah gift James 411 sorry Jacob let's go ahead and turn to that game 4 11 change for live-ins is talking about one unwarranted accusation you make where you just kind of invent a new law for your brother to follow speak not evil one of another brother and he just speaketh evil of his brother and judges the brother is speaketh evil of the law judges the law but if thou just a laulau are not a doer of the law for the judge and colossus to 2023 else I'll just read it wherefore if he be dead with Christ and the rudiments of the world why the living in the world and you subject to ordinances touch not taste not handle knock which are all to perish with using after the commandments and doctors for me which things have indeed a show of wisdom and will worship and humility and neglecting of the body not many honor to satisfy my flesh now so we were looking at judge not that ye be not judged now remember you're supposed to judge yourself so you don't judge others hypocritically and we judge ourselves so it will not be judged by God in second chronicles don't turn I'll just read it 7 13 14 God said if I should up ever there be no rain or if I command the locusts to the power of the land or if i send pestilence among my people my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will hear their land heal their land and the Corinthians have been guilty of turning communion into a feast if you judge yourself and God will you if you don't know yourself then will be judges first Corinthians 11 29 first a good way to remember their scriptures that there's three pillars 14 Corinthians 11 and in first Corinthians 11 is the scriptures about women wear hair and also by communion yes that's a good way to remember three pillars first Corinthians 11 for he that Edith and drinketh unworthily Ethan drinketh damnation to himself and not just learning boy's body this calls many are weak and sickly money in their measly four if we were jumped with judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasing of the lower than we should not be condemned with the world now I just wrote some notes from this little pamphlet this little booklet that brother Gordon Lindsey put out divine healing and the brand of campaigns and it's but a brand road forward I'm just going to read this real quick just to show that program actually read this and he said I personally requested those who come for healings you carefully read and study this booklet along with their Bible if there should be any one who cannot afford a small cost to personally request a copy of you giving that person but there's just a little quote I wanna read in core up the church have been seriously Bob divided there are differences of doctrine differences matter of leadership differences in the matter of water baptism these differences have produced contentions and divisions in the body of Christ but Paul remonstrated says Christ divided evidently the Corinthian church did not discern the horse body discern the Lord's body means to know that God is living in unities tabernacle in your flesh if you don't have that revelation then you're not discerning the Lord's body don't take the chameleon without discerning that he's living in you better miss Bell with you as a result meeting where we can sickly and many slept in death and the penalty of such division and lack of discernment was sickness and premature death what was true in the Corinthian church is true to a great extent today we must discern the Lord's body which is his church before we might banish sickness from our doors stop
