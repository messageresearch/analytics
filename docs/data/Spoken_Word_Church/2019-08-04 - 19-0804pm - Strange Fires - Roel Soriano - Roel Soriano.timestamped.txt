[13:48] this God may open our the ice of our
[13:51] understanding and see Jesus Christ this
[13:54] afternoon as we once again talk about
[13:57] this word and I was talking to buddy
[14:00] Vernon the other day and he sends
[14:02] greeting to all praise the Lord
[14:07] okay this afternoon we're just going to
[14:11] have a Bible study that okay just look
[14:16] at the Word of God and some quotations
[14:19] from the Prophet because I'm going to
[14:21] speak about strange spires afternoon
[14:26] strange spires we don't need any strange
[14:29] spire because we have the original fire
[14:33] with us today we will read from the Book
[14:40] of Leviticus chapter 9 verse 23 to 24
[14:48] first 23 reads and Moses and Aaron went
[14:55] into the tabernacle of the congregation
[14:56] and came out and blessed the people and
[15:01] the glory of the Lord appeared unto all
[15:04] the people and there came fire there
[15:09] came a fire out from before the Lord and
[15:12] consumed upon the altar the burnt
[15:15] offering and the fat which when all the
[15:19] people saw they shouted and fell on
[15:23] their faces Leviticus chapter 10 verses
[15:30] 1 to 3 we read and made AB and a by who
[15:36] the sons of Aaron took either of them
[15:40] censors and put fire therein doesn't say
[15:45] where they got the fire but they put
[15:46] fire therein and put incense upon
[15:50] thereon and offered strange fire by
[15:54] because it's strange fire before the
[15:57] Lord
[15:58] he commanded them not and there went out
[16:02] from the Lord and devoured them there
[16:08] went out fire from the Lord and devoured
[16:11] them and they died before the Lord then
[16:15] Moses said unto Aaron this is that the
[16:19] Lord spake saying I will be sanctified
[16:22] in them that come nigh me and before the
[16:26] people I will be glorified and Aaron
[16:30] held his peace these are the words of
[16:33] the Lord s pray Heavenly Father we ask
[16:35] once again that you come amongst us and
[16:39] give revelation father and give sense to
[16:44] your word this afternoon Lord if you
[16:46] talk about it
[16:47] and reach out to the needs you're needy
[16:50] a congregation this afternoon we want to
[16:53] thank you and give you a face forever in
[16:55] Jesus name we pray amen
[16:57] may be seated hallelujah so we find in
[17:07] in in Leviticus chapter 9 after this is
[17:16] the first time that they ever made a
[17:18] burnt sacrifice before the Lord you know
[17:21] in the tabernacle that they built in the
[17:24] wilderness and when Moses and Aaron came
[17:32] out they came out from there from the
[17:37] inner court and they were blessing the
[17:40] people as they were blessing the people
[17:43] like kind of probably telling them you
[17:47] know go in peace the Lord has blessed us
[17:50] and may the blessings of God be upon you
[17:53] and as they as they were saying that
[17:57] then fire the glory of the Lord appeared
[18:01] unto all the people and there came fire
[18:05] out from before the Lord of course they
[18:08] have already prepared
[18:10] sacrifice prior to this on the altar and
[18:14] when fire came before the Lord it
[18:16] consumed upon the altar the burnt
[18:19] offering and the fat which when all the
[18:24] people saw that they shouted and fell on
[18:27] their faces we understand that God comes
[18:32] in the form of a pillar of fire God is a
[18:36] consuming fire and the reason it came in
[18:43] a supernatural way is to vindicate God's
[18:48] Word and vindicate the man he's using in
[18:53] this case Moses was the man is using an
[18:56] air on his brother became I was chosen
[19:00] to be the high priest hallelujah and and
[19:03] so after they built the tabernacle and
[19:07] started offering their sacrifices
[19:12] then came the pillar of fire and
[19:13] consumed it's it's like God was pleased
[19:17] with their sacrifice and came down and
[19:20] ate and consumed their sacrifices
[19:23] hallelujah but then in Leviticus
[19:26] Leviticus chapter 10 the next verse that
[19:29] we read there were two persons NIDA been
[19:36] a by who and this were sons of Levi you
[19:41] know they were commissioned to do the
[19:45] priestly work you know the two to
[19:50] prepare the sacrifices and the altar and
[19:54] the tabernacle for worship they were
[19:59] designated to do it um in numbers
[20:03] chapter three we we read verse two and
[20:07] four these are the names of the sons of
[20:10] Aaron these are Aaron Sun the very sons
[20:15] of the high priests made up the
[20:18] firstborn in a by who and Eleazar and
[20:21] Ithamar these are the names of the
[20:24] even the priests which were unlearned
[20:26] that these people are anointed whom he
[20:30] consecrated to minister in the priests
[20:32] office and need up in a by who died
[20:36] before the Lord when they offered
[20:38] strange fire before the Lord in the
[20:41] wilderness of Sinai and they had no
[20:45] children meaning that was the end of
[20:47] their genealogy huh that was the end of
[20:50] their race this these people they were
[20:56] cut off from the face of the earth
[20:58] Halloween why because they offered
[21:02] strange fire we don't need any strange
[21:07] fire amongst us because we have the
[21:12] original fire in our meets the see faith
[21:19] sees what God wants done with God's Word
[21:23] that's what faith does to you God gives
[21:27] you faith and faith but ROM says is a
[21:29] revelation God gives you a revelation he
[21:34] does not only give you the word but it
[21:36] gives you a revelation of the word and
[21:40] faith is a revelation for you see faith
[21:43] sees what God's once done oh I hope this
[21:47] goes in but mom says it faith doesn't
[21:49] look at the present time it doesn't see
[21:53] this but faith looks to see what God
[21:55] wants and it works accordingly that's
[21:58] what faith does it says what God wants
[22:01] and what God's once then done and and
[22:05] faith operates through that hallelujah
[22:14] praise God
[22:17] in numbers chapter 16 verse 48 fire from
[22:23] the altar saved the nation that saved
[22:25] the saved Israel from the plague there
[22:28] was a plague because people started
[22:31] right racing up from amongst the
[22:34] congregation of Israel and they begin to
[22:37] tell Moses and Aaron you're lifting
[22:39] yourself up about the people you're
[22:42] putting too much on yourselves because
[22:44] the congregation is now holy we're all
[22:47] holy we're all children of God we don't
[22:52] have to listen to you in other words
[22:54] hallelujah and Moses said unto Aaron
[22:58] take a censer and put fire therein from
[23:02] the altar how this fire cramp came from
[23:06] the altar Aaron was instructed to get
[23:09] fire from the altar and put and put put
[23:13] on incense and go quickly into the
[23:16] congregation and make an atonement for
[23:18] them for days
[23:20] wrath ground out for the plague is begun
[23:24] now this happened and the congregation
[23:27] of people that wanted to worship God
[23:29] there wanting to worship God but they
[23:32] begin dying one by one you know you know
[23:36] what happened because they were
[23:38] sympathizing with Nathan Korah and a
[23:42] Byram you see I thought for me to
[23:47] comprehend it after God for the
[23:50] vindicated Moses and Aaron Moses to be
[23:54] an arrest messenger for their their to
[23:55] prop the prophet for their their day and
[24:00] after he made this from instructions God
[24:04] made instructions you stay the people
[24:07] that want to follow you stay with you
[24:09] and the ones that would like to follow
[24:12] Dayton and Korah and a Byram you stay
[24:15] with your tents and there was a
[24:17] separation made in the congregation of
[24:20] Israel and God just there was the the
[24:24] Bible says the ground clay under them
[24:27] there was there must have been a great
[24:30] earthquake and the ground crack and
[24:33] there was a and and the earth the Bible
[24:36] said swallowed the people a Byram and
[24:40] data named nathan in a barrel and all
[24:43] the people that followed that believed
[24:47] them they were saying you know not only
[24:50] Moses can preach they were the first
[24:54] came to thee people that were respected
[24:58] in the congregation people people who
[25:00] were learned were people who were who
[25:03] had wished them and they had influence
[25:05] in the people of Easter two hundred
[25:07] fifty fifty two hundred fifty princess
[25:09] were swayed by them and of course
[25:13] they're beginning to influence the other
[25:17] people into believing what they're
[25:21] saying you see I believe God chose
[25:24] certain people to lead his people God
[25:28] chose Israel no chose Moses I should say
[25:32] to lead his people out of Egypt and in
[25:36] the wilderness and into the Promised
[25:38] Land
[25:39] hallelujah so
[25:48] thousands of people died already
[25:50] swallowed by the earth but then the next
[25:55] morning if you read in your Bible the
[25:56] next morning people were sympathizing
[26:00] with the people that died and saying
[26:03] Moses killed these people
[26:06] Moses you killed the people of the Lord
[26:08] you know and they were murmuring they
[26:11] were sympathizing and that's when the
[26:14] the plague struck the people and people
[26:17] just started falling dead hallelujah and
[26:21] so Moses gave the instruction to take
[26:24] fire from the altar and put it on the
[26:28] instant and put incense and go quickly
[26:30] into the congregation and make an
[26:32] atonement that is what saved the people
[26:35] tens of thousands of people died because
[26:38] they sympathize with the wrong thing you
[26:45] see real revival glorifies God and
[26:50] throws the people in submission to a
[26:53] vindicated leadership this is the reason
[26:59] why fire comes down from heaven to start
[27:04] a real revival what I mean by that is
[27:08] that to show that the message the
[27:14] messages of the messenger was the truth
[27:16] and that he has accepted their service
[27:20] their ministry and that they have to
[27:23] come under the headship of this
[27:26] particular ministry will let me say that
[27:29] again real revival glorifies God and
[27:32] throws the people in submission to vidiq
[27:36] to a vindicated leadership 1st Kings
[27:41] chapter 18 verse 37 to 39 this was the
[27:47] showdown on mark Mount Carmel Elijah
[27:52] prayed hear me O Lord hear me that these
[27:56] people may know that thou art God and
[27:59] the doors turned there
[28:01] heart back again then the fire of the
[28:03] Lord fell and consumed the burnt
[28:06] sacrifice and the wood and the stone in
[28:09] the dust and licked up the water that
[28:11] was in this trench and when all the
[28:14] people saw it see the result they fell
[28:18] down again
[28:19] they failed down today their faces and
[28:21] they said the Lord he is God the Lord he
[28:24] is God this is true revival hallelujah
[28:30] the Ministry of Elijah brought real
[28:32] revival to the nation of Israel
[28:35] Jesus okay we understand that God
[28:42] manifests himself through a form of a
[28:45] fire hallelujah Moses met the burning
[28:50] bush Elijah and Ezekiel saw God in a
[28:54] form of fire Paul met the same on the
[28:58] road to Damascus and fire from God
[29:02] initially they lit the altar of the
[29:04] tabernacle you know the same thing
[29:06] happened when the Temple of Solomon was
[29:08] dedicated hallelujah the priests were
[29:12] commanded to keep the fire burning on
[29:15] the altar it is a sign of God's
[29:18] perpetual presence or the policy or the
[29:23] coming to make his abode in the temple
[29:26] God did not just come he came to stay he
[29:32] came in abode in his temple
[29:35] Alleluia fire came down also from the
[29:39] upper room at the beginning of the
[29:41] church to see every time they built
[29:44] something built a place of worship for
[29:47] God and dedicated it fire comes down and
[29:51] consumes the sacrifice o God always
[29:54] manifested himself by sending fire from
[29:57] heaven hallelujah so the mystical body
[30:04] that's the Church of Jesus Christ the
[30:07] first believers on the day of Pentecost
[30:09] they were gathered on the upper room
[30:11] they were dedicating themselves
[30:14] they were in one Accord even one spirit
[30:17] then fire from heaven once again came
[30:20] hallelujah and divided itself amongst
[30:23] the believers and tongues of fires
[30:26] stayed on each one of them and they
[30:30] began to be filled with the spirit and
[30:32] started speaking in tongues we know that
[30:34] is true God also lead the altar of the
[30:39] lead the altar of the temple second
[30:42] quranic chronicles chapter 7 verse 1 2 3
[30:45] now when solomon had made an end of
[30:49] praying the fire came down from heaven
[30:51] and consumed the burnt offering and the
[30:54] sacrifices and the glory of glory of the
[30:57] Lord filled the house you see when the
[31:00] tabernacle was built fire came down and
[31:05] then Solomon built the temple then fire
[31:09] came down and consumed the sacrifices
[31:12] and then all the children of Esau saw
[31:14] that the fire came down the holy the
[31:17] glory of the Lord upon the house and
[31:21] they bowed themselves with their faces
[31:23] to the ground upon the pavement and
[31:25] worship and praise the Lord saying for
[31:27] he is good and His mercy and do it
[31:30] forever
[31:31] you see it produces the same result the
[31:34] same effect on the people they bow down
[31:37] humbled UM's themselves down and
[31:40] recognize the power of Almighty God the
[31:45] presence of God amongst them and and
[31:49] gave him praise and worship hallelujah
[31:52] you see that's why it's our priestly
[31:56] duty to keep the fire burning so the
[31:59] priests were commanded to not let the
[32:04] fire from the altar go out you see that
[32:09] fire is now it's no ordinary fire it did
[32:12] not came it did not come from from
[32:16] matches or man-made no my maid operation
[32:21] it did not come from butane gas you know
[32:24] the fire came down
[32:26] heaven this is supernatural fire
[32:30] hallelujah Leviticus chapter 6 verse 12
[32:33] to 13 and the fire upon the altar shall
[32:37] be burning in it that's why this is the
[32:39] Commission Commission this is the
[32:42] commandment to the ministry is to keep
[32:45] the fire burning because the fire upon
[32:48] upon the altar shall be burning in it
[32:50] and it shall not be put out and the
[32:53] priest shall burn wood on it every
[32:55] morning they and they and the burnt
[32:58] offering in order upon it and he shall
[33:01] burn there on the fact of peace
[33:03] offerings and the fire shall ever be
[33:06] burning upon the altar it shall never go
[33:09] out it's important that the fire in the
[33:14] altar don't go out that's why it's the
[33:17] responsibility of the Levites the
[33:19] priests to keep the fire burning of

[34:08] about it in Revelations one verse pub
[34:10] and also in Sakurai chapter four verse
[34:11] one two three it's represented fire
[34:17] comes from God and there must be oil in
[34:22] the in the lamp and it supplies oil to
[34:28] each and every branch which causes the
[34:31] the lamp every lamp there are seven of
[34:34] them to be burning of course we
[34:38] understand that the seven golden golden
[34:40] hundred six represent the seventh Church
[34:42] ages hallelujah
[34:45] here's what happened butter bottom says
[34:48] they lit one lamp and then picked it up
[34:52] and lit the other lamp and then set it
[34:56] down and lit this lamp and then took it
[35:02] lit this lamp with the same fire that's
[35:04] it they started at the beginning are you
[35:07] getting it the fire the original fire
[35:10] that came down from heaven lit the altar
[35:13] and from the altar the high priest would
[35:16] take fire and light the first lamp and
[35:20] then he picks up the second lamp and
[35:23] then lights it up again with the same
[35:27] fire that they started at the beginning
[35:29] but one said oh I hope you don't go over
[35:32] your head
[35:33] mother Brown is trying to show us
[35:35] something here this is Jesus Christ the
[35:38] same yesterday today and forever
[35:41] the same Holy Ghost lit every one of
[35:44] those churches light down through the
[35:46] ages when fire came down on the day of
[35:49] Pentecost hallelujah and that fire was
[35:52] never put out it continues amen
[35:57] to burn throughout the Seven Church ages
[36:01] hallelujah it is burning still in our
[36:04] church eggs hallelujah when brother
[36:10] Branham died in an accident the pillar
[36:13] of fire didn't die it's still burning
[36:17] it's still in the midst of the people
[36:19] hallelujah amen we don't need no other
[36:23] fire we don't need men man manufactured
[36:28] fire man made fire that's a fake fire
[36:31] that strange fire hallelujah we need the
[36:34] one the original
[36:37] supernatural fire that came down from
[36:39] God hallelujah notice better BAM said
[36:46] the same fire that burnt the oil there
[36:49] in Ephesus burned it in fat IRA
[36:54] the same fire burnt their burnt it in
[36:58] Pergamos burnt on down through to the
[37:02] through the Laodicean Church age as he
[37:05] says we're living in the same what the
[37:08] same Holy Spirit lit by the same God by
[37:13] the same fire and the fire that fell on
[37:16] Pentecost has lit the candle and the
[37:20] church through every age right on down
[37:23] now hallelujah oh I believe it I love
[37:29] the same pillar of fire has lit this
[37:32] church aids hallelujah
[37:36] of course gitarama in chapter 4 verse 23
[37:41] to 24 says that God is a consuming fire
[37:43] let me read it to you take heed unto
[37:46] yourselves lest ye forget the Covenant
[37:49] of the Lord your God which he made with
[37:51] you and make you a graven image or the
[37:56] likeness of anything which the Lord God
[37:58] thy God had forbidden D for the LORD thy
[38:01] God is a consuming fire even a jealous
[38:05] fire who God wants God is asking for a
[38:10] full attention amen
[38:14] for our full worship hallelujah we are
[38:17] not to worship anything else but him he
[38:20] is a jealous God too he is a fire and
[38:24] it's a jealous God oh my goodness
[38:26] consuming fire and it's jealous
[38:32] Redemption by power I'll read a quote
[38:36] God gave them the pillar of fire to go
[38:40] before them I think they had a picture
[38:43] here tonight and I say it with reverence
[38:46] to my honest opinion while we're here in
[38:51] this group tonight I believe I believe
[38:54] that this is with us tonight this is
[38:57] what man is speaking this this picture
[39:01] of the pillar fire is with us tonight
[39:03] the same pillar of fire that
[39:07] let the children of israel is going
[39:10] before us you believe that I believe
[39:13] this with all my heart
[39:14] performing the same science and wonders
[39:17] and any teacher here or scholar the
[39:22] Bible knows that the angel that followed
[39:25] Israel guided them to the promised land
[39:27] and the was the Angel of the covenant
[39:31] which was Jesus Christ hallelujah
[39:35] so God Brown is slowly attending us the
[39:40] connection between the pillar of fire
[39:42] and this angel now God has provided a
[39:47] lamb Paul recognized who the fire was
[39:50] who the pillar of fire was just to see
[39:54] him standing there great pillar of fire
[39:56] he said I come from God I go to God he
[40:02] was the low gas that was with Moses in
[40:05] the wilderness say amen to that
[40:07] hallelujah he was the no gas that was
[40:10] with Moses in the wilderness the pillar
[40:12] of fire he died on Calvary he was raised
[40:16] again and then Saul was on his road to
[40:20] Damascus that same pillar fire struck
[40:23] him down he said who are you lord
[40:26] see Paul was learned in the scriptures
[40:29] and he knew very well that Lord eloheem
[40:33] appeared in a pillar of fire that's why
[40:37] when the pillar of fire met him on the
[40:40] road to Damascus he he fell fell from
[40:47] his horse and stuck the ground and said
[40:50] who are you lord he doesn't know his
[40:55] name but he called him Lord means Elohim
[40:58] I know your God but who are you
[41:01] of course the answer was I am Jesus
[41:08] Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of
[41:12] the new now there are people that come
[41:16] to tell us that their Jehovah is a
[41:18] different person
[41:20] from Jesus they're saying the Lord said
[41:23] unto my lord the lord is your OVA and my
[41:27] lord is jesus well that's nonsense
[41:30] to me that strange spire I don't see it
[41:33] in the Bible it's not in the message
[41:35] that strange spires hallelujah because
[41:38] Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus
[41:40] Christ of the new hallelujah and when
[41:44] Paul asked the pillar of fire who are
[41:46] you he said he answered I am Jesus whom
[41:51] thou persecutors next life there's a
[41:58] picture of the pillar of fire over
[42:00] brother Branham and then describe
[42:04] inspect this picture the healing of
[42:07] Jerry gyros a daughter he said but that
[42:10] camera won't take an optical illusion
[42:15] the light really struck the lens this is
[42:19] a scientific proof that the same pillar
[42:22] of fire that led the children of Israel
[42:24] which is none other than none other than
[42:27] Jesus Christ Himself was raised has
[42:30] raised from the dead in the form of the
[42:32] spirit and is with the church tonight
[42:35] moving on with the same signs and
[42:38] wonders I believe this with all my heart
[42:41] hallelujah so he described how this
[42:43] photograph was taken six shots were
[42:47] taken abettor venom and the six
[42:49] negatives turned out to be blank but the
[42:53] seventh showed a picture of the halo of
[42:56] light over brother MEMS head it's the
[42:59] same pillar of fire but the bottom said
[43:01] that led the children of Israel
[43:04] hallelujah now let's go back to the sons
[43:08] of Levi need up in a by who
[43:12] getting killed by the pillar fire what
[43:15] was their sin what was their sin they
[43:20] only wanted to serve God you know burnt
[43:23] incense before the altar and God killed
[43:26] them right there
[43:27] what was their sin God did not command
[43:32] them to offer incense
[43:34] at this particular moment of special
[43:36] visitation
[43:38] there was no command they just did it
[43:41] upon themselves you know and offered
[43:46] fire before the altar also they presume
[43:51] it would be okay to offer incense as
[43:54] they were anointed to perform the duties
[43:56] of priests they were supposed to be
[43:58] ministers in the Old Testament where
[44:01] ministers were supposed to do this offer
[44:03] incense and fire upon the altar they
[44:08] probably were moved by the overwhelming
[44:10] display of the presence of the Lord
[44:13] hallelujah they were calling attention
[44:18] to themselves in a time when everyone
[44:22] should be focused on what God is doing
[44:24] at the moment and should be worshipping
[44:27] and glorifying God in any service God
[44:34] should be the main focus all attention
[44:38] should be given come on hundred percent
[44:41] to him and him alone hallelujah any
[44:45] distraction hallelujah is a sin any
[44:50] destruction is strange Speier did I say
[45:00] they offered strange fire any form of
[45:05] fire apart from the one that originated
[45:08] from God cannot mingle with it strange
[45:16] fires are strange doctrines manufactured
[45:21] by men and that contaminates the power
[45:24] of God you see you can't be inventing
[45:28] your own duckling and mixing it with but
[45:30] what God has has to bring to us in our
[45:34] age hallelujah
[45:36] outside of the message I cannot take it
[45:40] outside of the Bible I cannot take it
[45:44] hallelujah
[45:48] wildfires are the slightest distraction
[45:52] from worship any form of irreverence
[45:57] hallelujah the slightest destruction
[46:00] from from the worship of God like your
[46:04] cell phones can be a distraction amen
[46:08] amen
[46:10] like your job can be a distraction
[46:13] hallelujah no you know you're willing to
[46:17] work overtime but you sit in church
[46:20] sleeping through the service the strange
[46:24] spire but yeah I don't do you and God
[46:30] doesn't want painted fire he wants the
[46:34] real fire the original fire God came
[46:36] from God but herb Adam says now you see
[46:39] you're putting on something that isn't
[46:42] real now you cannot get warm by a
[46:46] painted fire it was talking about the
[46:49] Pentecostal movement and it lingered on
[46:51] during his time you cannot get warm
[46:54] about a painted fire like some of this
[46:57] church is trying to paint Pentecost or
[47:00] something that happened a thousand years
[47:01] ago or 2,000 years ago you cannot get
[47:04] warm by a painted fire Pentecost is just
[47:09] as well today as it was then how can you
[47:13] become deck contented with painted fire
[47:16] when there is true eternal fire that
[47:19] comes from God I mean still burning
[47:22] hallelujah in the Church of God today
[47:25] hallelujah you cannot get warm by a
[47:28] painted fire Pentecost is just a field
[47:31] today as it was then see the fire is
[47:34] still falling
[47:36] it ain't a painted fire it's real fire
[47:40] from God Springs fires are manufactured
[47:49] or man-made fires these are historical
[47:54] or psychological or psychological or
[47:58] purely emotional revival
[48:04] strange spires is a safe self acclaimed
[48:09] ministry this is a military ministry
[48:14] that calls attention to cell
[48:17] you know I wonder about these ministers
[48:20] that that have halos in their
[48:26] photographs and put them on websites you
[48:28] know just to to to to to to make to make
[48:34] a claim that the same fire visited them
[48:37] it better be the same fire amen
[48:41] if not it's strange spire and if it's a
[48:46] calling attention to one's ministry to
[48:49] the person rather than the message to
[48:52] the to the preacher rather than Jesus
[48:54] Christ it's it's strange fire false
[49:00] teachings mixed with a pure word or
[49:04] man-made interpretation this is strange
[49:07] fire now we were commissioned in
[49:10] Revelations 10 to prophesy again which
[49:13] means we can only prophesy or preach
[49:16] what has already been preached we cannot
[49:20] add or take away from it hallelujah we
[49:24] already have thus saith the Lord this is
[49:29] strange fire is hypocritical godliness
[49:36] like what happened to Ananias and
[49:39] Sapphira they made the impression that
[49:42] they were all out in giving to the cause
[49:45] of the gospel they were actually rubbing
[49:47] the ministry think about it and God had
[49:50] to kill them show an example the third
[49:56] pole is not a public show and the angel
[50:01] actually rebuked brother Branham for
[50:04] being a show man you know first of all
[50:08] he was trying to explain how the first
[50:10] pole operated see these little bumps
[50:12] I'll hold your hand and I can see what's
[50:15] wrong with
[50:15] you would be the man and his bumps are
[50:18] moving in my hands and he was trying to
[50:20] explain to the people and SEC second
[50:23] poll came and he's saying the scene
[50:26] appears before me like on a screen you
[50:29] know and I see a woman becoming a little
[50:32] girl and then he tells people how it
[50:34] happens you know that God was showing
[50:36] him he was actually trying to explain
[50:40] everything and the angel said you
[50:43] explained the first pool the second pool
[50:44] you explained that you cannot explain
[50:47] the third pool there's no explaining the
[50:50] third pool hallelujah and when as he was
[50:53] preaching on the seventh seal and
[50:55] brother branham Sin City said I better
[50:57] stop I sense that he wants me to stop
[51:01] right here you cannot explain revelation
[51:05] I mean the third pool is Christ in you
[51:08] that's the greatest mystery the third
[51:11] pole is Christ in the closet of your
[51:14] heart
[51:17] Matthew 23 verse 27 woe unto you scribes
[51:22] and Pharisees hypocrites scribes and
[51:26] Pharisees are serving the Lord trade
[51:29] they're claiming to be T to represent
[51:31] God for ye are like whited sepulchers
[51:34] which indeed appear beautiful outward
[51:36] but are within full of dead men's bones
[51:39] and of all uncleanness you think God
[51:47] doesn't see it God sees every hypocrisy
[51:51] hypocritical action that we may 1st
[51:54] Peter chapter 3 verse Peter for whose
[51:57] adorning let it not be the outward
[51:59] adorning and the plaything of hair and a
[52:02] wearing of gold and are putting on her
[52:04] apparel but let it be the hidden man of
[52:07] the heart see God is interested in
[52:10] looking at that what the hidden man of
[52:13] the heart in that which is not
[52:17] corruptable
[52:18] even the Ormond of a meek and quiet
[52:20] spirit which in the sight of God is
[52:23] great or some great prize quiet spirit
[52:30] seems like American people are they are
[52:32] so hard for them to identify with that
[52:36] but God will produce quiet spirit in a
[52:42] person when that fire comes into you
[52:45] First Samuel chapter 16 verse 7 for the
[52:49] Lord see it not as a man see it for a
[52:51] man looketh on the outward appearance
[52:53] but the Lord looketh on the heart
[52:57] hallelujah baptism of the Holy Spirit by
[53:03] the Benham pump brakes on the holiness
[53:05] groups there then we are going to come
[53:09] over to the Armenian side he blasts the
[53:13] Calvinists and then he now comes to
[53:15] their minions and blast their meanings
[53:17] what did they get works
[53:21] that's the holiness groups works blessed
[53:26] God I let my hair go out the woman you
[53:29] know praise God I won't even wear a
[53:31] short sleeve skirt the man will and so
[53:34] forth like that that has nothing to do
[53:37] with the kingdom no sir you can let your
[53:42] hair grow long you can wear dresses
[53:44] whatever you want to or you can do this
[53:47] that or the other
[53:48] it won't help nothing to do at all to do
[53:51] with it you are not saved because of
[53:54] your clothes I want to read that again
[53:57] you are not saved because of your
[54:00] clothes
[54:01] if so God would just have made some
[54:04] patterns of such get a pattern and pass
[54:11] it to the sisters I'm thinking of the of
[54:17] the the amis people yet you talk about
[54:23] holiness and the manner of dressing in
[54:25] the lifestyle and they were able to
[54:28] maintain this kind of lifestyle for
[54:30] hundreds of years
[54:32] hallelujah God is not in it it's not the
[54:36] works
[54:37] hallelujah these people cannot work you
[54:40] hallelujah because they they dress
[54:44] holiday this the top holding the
[54:46] lifetime so little don't even have
[54:48] electricity
[54:49] sitting in this inside house any form of
[54:52] entertainment hallelujah hallelujah if
[54:57] God is looking to that well I just I'll
[55:00] just join the Amish country join the
[55:05] Mennonites but God doesn't look at that
[55:09] he's looking at the heart hallelujah
[55:20] Jesus God would just have made some
[55:23] patterns of thoughts and Jesus wouldn't
[55:25] have to die see you're not saved because
[55:29] of the clothes you're wearing you say
[55:32] because Jesus died for you hallelujah
[55:35] and we only do these things you know
[55:38] let our air our air out let our hair
[55:43] grow out you sisters because of
[55:46] appreciation you are saved because that
[55:50] God saved you by grace and you do these
[55:54] things just in appreciation you don't do
[55:57] it to be saved but you do it because
[56:00] you're saying hallelujah common decency
[56:04] will tell you that you do those things
[56:06] in appreciation works is what I do for
[56:10] God and may God help us not to take on
[56:16] this holier-than-thou attitude this
[56:19] bedroom said here you him you say I let
[56:22] my hair grow along but about him I want
[56:24] to look like a Christian who doesn't you
[56:28] all want to look like a question but if
[56:31] that isn't coming from the inside it
[56:34] will sooner about again it will never
[56:39] last
[56:40] hallelujah it will rub out again
[56:43] certainly it will you get that holier
[56:45] than thou art attitude that is wrong
[56:50] or help us but if the Spirit of Christ
[56:53] comes in and it will actually bring
[56:56] forth new life then it's not nothing
[56:59] legally anymore it's something that's in
[57:02] your heart that sprout forth these
[57:05] things you'll get away from the walls of
[57:07] these modern Babylon buildings
[57:09] that's fixing to fall anyhow but graham
[57:13] says Arminianism holiness is correct as
[57:18] long at this stage it stays in the Bible
[57:21] holiness
[57:22] I believe in holiness to Berta BAM said
[57:26] Bible as long as it's Bible holiness not
[57:30] your holiness but his holiness see and
[57:35] that is that is not my bit business I'm
[57:38] not depending on my holiness I have none
[57:42] not the part of God said this he had no
[57:46] holiness of himself
[57:48] I don't depend on my own holiness I have
[57:52] none
[57:52] but I'm wholly trusting in his holiness
[57:55] hallelu see it he's the one who did it
[57:59] not my works but his finished works that
[58:02] I rest assured that I have I was
[58:05] received into the beloved and when the
[58:07] beloved was asleep by God then God
[58:09] received me in Christ and that settles
[58:12] it amen I thank God that I can rest in
[58:18] what he did 2,000 years ago on the cross
[58:22] of Calvary hallelujah the result of
[58:25] wildfire or strange spires is death next
[58:33] life just like David organizing a great
[58:39] parade religious parade making a new car
[58:42] to carry the ark and cause the death of
[58:46] a sincere believer think about it what
[58:51] did David do he put together a nice
[58:56] mechanism a nice machine with spools on
[59:00] it and put the word
[59:02] on that machine when it's supposed to be
[59:07] the arch is supposed to be carried on
[59:10] staves amen
[59:12] bye-bye on the shoulders of the five
[59:17] fold of the the priest the five fold
[59:20] ministry above the heart of the people
[59:24] should be carried by ministers not put
[59:28] in a machine with spools are you
[59:31] understanding me they might be they
[59:36] might miss sincere but Birnbaum said
[59:38] they're sincerely wrong and by their
[59:43] acts sincere believers can die like Pusa
[59:54] was sincere sincere believer and God
[59:56] struck him dead and don't worship out of
[1:00:01] posterity just for looks
[1:00:05] God is not impressed by any form of
[1:00:09] performance we don't try to entertain
[1:00:15] outward wholeness means nothing to God
[1:00:19] mother he hates it he put critical
[1:00:23] holiness he hates it it should come from
[1:00:26] the inside should be his holiness
[1:00:29] showing forth on the outside him anytime
[1:00:33] one goes out of place and thus God the
[1:00:37] service outside of the will of God
[1:00:39] it's strange fire to God God hates it
[1:00:44] denominational system is out of the will
[1:00:47] of God and has resulted in spiritual
[1:00:50] death how many knows that Satan
[1:00:54] interpreted the word to Eve and the
[1:00:56] result was death high breathing only
[1:01:01] causes it only produces death hallelujah
[1:01:07] here I forgot to give God the glory the
[1:01:12] people thought that it was the voice of
[1:01:14] God speaking to them
[1:01:16] she was a learned man you know he can
[1:01:19] speak nicely before the people lets it
[1:01:26] read in Acts chapter 12 or 12 verse 21
[1:01:29] to 23 and upon a set day he rod arrayed
[1:01:33] in royal apparel sat upon his throne and
[1:01:36] made an oration unto them he made a
[1:01:40] speech hallelujah and the people gave
[1:01:43] them gave a shout saying it is the voice
[1:01:46] of a god and not a man and immediately
[1:01:50] look what happened watch what happened
[1:01:51] immediately the angel of God smote of
[1:01:54] the Lord smote him because he gave not
[1:01:57] God the glory and he was eaten of worms
[1:02:00] and gave up the ghost he died right
[1:02:03] there and then next like the third pole
[1:02:09] is not a public show and watch
[1:02:14] he's always scriptural he said did not
[1:02:19] our Lord say when thou preyus be not
[1:02:22] like the hypocrites that like to wear to
[1:02:26] make a show said enter into the secret
[1:02:29] closet and when you've done so close the
[1:02:32] door and pray to your father what that
[1:02:35] see it in secret and he that see it in
[1:02:38] secret shall reward thee openly he said
[1:02:42] I will meet you in there and this at
[1:02:45] this time it won't be a public public
[1:02:48] show that's this is what the angel of
[1:02:50] the Lord told Batman I will meet you in
[1:02:52] there in that closet in that wooden room
[1:02:56] hallelujah and this will not be a public
[1:03:00] show it's not for entertainment let's
[1:03:07] let's skip the scripture
[1:03:10] we are not to misconstrue the messengers
[1:03:13] message her mom said now we are in the
[1:03:20] evening time and the messengers down
[1:03:23] through the aides we find out at the
[1:03:26] beginning when a messenger was sent to
[1:03:29] misconstrue his word or to doubt one
[1:03:32] word it means total annihilation and
[1:03:36] eternal separation from God this is
[1:03:38] scary
[1:03:38] to misconstrue that messengers word
[1:03:44] that's why we need to be careful to only
[1:03:46] say what the tapes say listen may I say
[1:03:52] this right quick now even the visions
[1:03:54] that God gives me here the place it's so
[1:03:57] misunderstood that's the reason you hear
[1:04:01] me on the tape say say only what the
[1:04:04] tapes say say what the visions say and
[1:04:09] he said in church areas in every age we
[1:04:13] have exactly the same pattern that is
[1:04:16] why light comes through the some given
[1:04:18] God given messenger in a certain area
[1:04:21] and then from that messenger these
[1:04:24] spreads through the ministry over others
[1:04:26] who have been faithfully taught this is
[1:04:29] how God operates first it speaks to the
[1:04:32] main man and this messenger amen
[1:04:35] propagates the word to other other
[1:04:38] people other ministers who have been
[1:04:41] faithfully taught pray for me because
[1:04:45] every month we do a training session and
[1:04:49] our ministers fellowship every just
[1:04:51] first Tuesday of the month and initially
[1:04:55] it was intended for young ministers that
[1:04:59] come up in our own assembly but when I
[1:05:03] opened it up to other churches another
[1:05:05] ministers came ministers that are older
[1:05:08] than me ministers are more senior than
[1:05:11] me
[1:05:11] came to be to learn about the message
[1:05:16] because paradigm said you know gather
[1:05:18] the ministers and train them in the
[1:05:20] message that's what we need
[1:05:22] ministers that are
[1:05:24] in the message not in bible school not
[1:05:28] in manmade theology or psychology but
[1:05:31] trained in the message hallelujah but of
[1:05:38] course those who go out don't always
[1:05:40] learn how necessary it is to speak only
[1:05:44] what the messenger has spoken it's
[1:05:46] important that this we speak only what
[1:05:49] the messenger has already spoken because
[1:05:53] after preaching the seals for eight days
[1:05:56] this is what the Prophet said now the
[1:05:59] vision plus the word plus the history
[1:06:03] plus the church ages you think you're
[1:06:07] just reading a book or listening to a
[1:06:09] tape now these are the vision plus the
[1:06:13] word plus history plus the searcher
[1:06:16] changes and all blend together so I
[1:06:19] could truly say that to the best of my
[1:06:22] understanding according to the Word of
[1:06:24] God and the vision and the revelation
[1:06:26] the interpretation thereof is thus saith
[1:06:29] the Lord
[1:06:30] I mean after preaching the whole series
[1:06:34] on the seals it said everything the
[1:06:37] vision in history everything that is in
[1:06:40] this book is thus saith the Lord
[1:06:43] hallelujah god forbid that we take away
[1:06:45] from it or add from it
[1:06:49] no in our country people are afraid to
[1:06:55] evangelize with the message I wonder why
[1:06:59] that was but we have a special way of
[1:07:03] presenting the gospel of salvation its
[1:07:06] anointed I'm telling you it's anointed
[1:07:09] and it affects the people that hears the
[1:07:12] word will be presented hallelujah so we
[1:07:17] started the mr. Expo seminar we go right
[1:07:20] to the leaders and invite them for a
[1:07:23] whole day to listen to the presentation
[1:07:26] of the word and by God's grace out of
[1:07:29] this we have led close to a hundred
[1:07:31] churches these are denominational
[1:07:34] churches and these churches have
[1:07:37] come to embrace the message and they are
[1:07:39] now believing the message of the hour
[1:07:41] thank God hallelujah hallelujah pray for
[1:07:48] this effort because I'm I've been
[1:07:51] constantly shot by other ministers even
[1:07:54] in the message you know I get the people
[1:07:58] to come in the message in this
[1:07:59] denomination they use new group they
[1:08:01] forsake their old denominational ways
[1:08:03] and start preaching the message to them
[1:08:06] but once I get the people to to come in
[1:08:09] the churches they come in and mass as a
[1:08:12] whole church they come in then here
[1:08:14] comes the other ministers trying to
[1:08:18] convince the new group of people to
[1:08:22] listen to them they're not working for
[1:08:25] the same cause they're actually working
[1:08:29] contrary fighting the cause of God they
[1:08:34] say that the seven seals were Pittsburgh
[1:08:37] bearable but there are other seven seals
[1:08:40] on the back side of the book you have to
[1:08:43] go to them to know the revelation of
[1:08:45] these other seven seals that to me
[1:08:48] strange Speier if it's there there are
[1:08:54] more than one Lord a strange spire to me
[1:08:59] you preach that you have two souls
[1:09:03] strengths by there's a group that
[1:09:07] teaches that the seven thunders are
[1:09:10] seven men and you have to listen to this
[1:09:13] man in order for you to know when
[1:09:15] exactly the day the time and the and the
[1:09:18] hour that the lord should come on the
[1:09:21] strange fire hallelujah thank you Jesus
[1:09:29] now this messenger of Malachi 4 in
[1:09:32] revelation 10 7 is going to do two
[1:09:34] things
[1:09:34] uh-huh what are these two things one
[1:09:38] according to Malachi for he will turn
[1:09:40] the hearts of the children to the
[1:09:41] father's two he will he will reveal the
[1:09:45] mysteries of the seven thunders in
[1:09:47] Revelation 10 which are the revelations
[1:09:50] contained in this
[1:09:51] SILS and it will be this divinely
[1:09:53] revealed mystery truths that literally
[1:09:56] turn the hearts of the children to our
[1:09:58] Pentecostal fathers hallelujah the seven
[1:10:04] thunders and then there's coming for
[1:10:06] seven mysterious thunders but mom said
[1:10:09] that's not even written at all that's
[1:10:12] right and I believe that through these
[1:10:15] seven thunders will be revealed in the
[1:10:17] last days in order to get the bride
[1:10:19] together for rapturing faith amen you
[1:10:24] want to be in the rapture you need
[1:10:26] rapturing faith hallelujah you want to
[1:10:29] be healed you need healing faith that's
[1:10:32] what you need to be healed you want to
[1:10:34] be saved all you need is saving faith
[1:10:37] but if you want to be in the rapture
[1:10:39] you need to have rapturing faith in you
[1:10:43] hallelujah and this can only come to you
[1:10:46] through the seven thunders there's
[1:10:50] something we've got to step farther we
[1:10:53] can't have enough faith for divine
[1:10:55] healing hardly you've got to have enough
[1:10:57] faith to be changed in a moment and be
[1:11:00] swept out of this earth the seven
[1:11:04] thunders are not seven set of doctrines
[1:11:06] I'm sorry seven thunders seven is God's
[1:11:10] number of completion and the breaking of
[1:11:13] the seven seals is God complete
[1:11:15] revelation of himself is that clear the
[1:11:20] seventh seal is the mystery that
[1:11:23] contains all the mysteries in the Bible
[1:11:26] it's an all-encompassing mystery
[1:11:30] revelation ten seven but in the days of
[1:11:32] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[1:11:34] shall begin to sound then the mystery of
[1:11:36] God one minister said you see better
[1:11:39] well it says mystery not mysteries yes
[1:11:44] he was meaning he was telling me you see
[1:11:47] the mystery the word mystery there
[1:11:51] revelation 10 7 speaks about the Godhead
[1:11:54] he said that's the mystery that that
[1:11:58] that's been finished when brother
[1:11:59] Branham was here as he has declared to
[1:12:02] his servants the prophets
[1:12:04] but you see when brother branham
[1:12:05] explained it to explain it this way in
[1:12:07] the next slide
[1:12:09] Birnbaum says and be realized in the
[1:12:12] scriptures over in Malachi 4 there is to
[1:12:15] be one like John on Elijah to whom the
[1:12:19] Word of God can come to and he is to
[1:12:22] reveal by the Holy Spirit all the
[1:12:26] mysteries of God he interpreted it in
[1:12:30] this vague explain it to us in this way
[1:12:32] mystery of God's Spirit mystery one
[1:12:35] single mystery but Bertman said all the
[1:12:39] mysteries of God amen this is an
[1:12:43] all-encompassing mystery all mysteries
[1:12:47] in the Bible are hidden in this great
[1:12:48] mystery of Revelation 10 7 hallelujah
[1:12:52] this is the open book hallelujah that
[1:12:57] that that that John took from the hand
[1:13:00] of the angel you see see I think that's
[1:13:03] the problem when people try to take it
[1:13:06] from the hand of the seventh angel
[1:13:08] there's a problem he won't be under able
[1:13:13] to understand the message that open book
[1:13:16] you need to get it from the hand of the
[1:13:18] mighty angel hallelujah hallelujah
[1:13:23] because if you think of it even but when
[1:13:25] we cannot give you a revelation the
[1:13:28] person of brother Branham cannot give
[1:13:29] you a revelation only Jesus Christ can
[1:13:31] give you a revelation of the open book
[1:13:35] hallelujah
[1:13:39] to restore back all these mysteries
[1:13:41] that's been probed that program through
[1:13:44] denominational arrears hallelujah in rub
[1:13:51] in the message paradox
[1:13:54] he was Parabellum spoke about this this
[1:13:59] man who said that's after he spoke he
[1:14:04] said that's that could be the 23rd
[1:14:06] chapter of Revelation let's let's look
[1:14:09] at it after speaking on the seed is not
[1:14:11] every the shop in Los Angeles California
[1:14:14] this man came up here
[1:14:17] put his arms around me I was going to
[1:14:20] say he said brother branham not to be
[1:14:23] sacrilegious but that could have made
[1:14:26] the 24 chap 23rd chapter of Revelation
[1:14:29] now humming knows there's no 23rd
[1:14:32] chapter of Revelation but this man was
[1:14:35] saying that can be added to the
[1:14:37] scriptures hallelujah
[1:14:42] you know another book added of course he
[1:14:45] said that wouldn't be right of course
[1:14:47] but we're not supposed to add anything
[1:14:50] to it and just as I started to say that
[1:14:52] he started speaking in tongues and the
[1:14:54] boy didn't know about speaking in
[1:14:58] tongues what it meant
[1:15:00] and here's another incident here well
[1:15:05] somebody was trying to catch brother
[1:15:07] branham next slide even brother Branham
[1:15:12] could not do it he couldn't add to it or
[1:15:15] take away from the word it taught me
[1:15:17] about the Bible now hallelujah remenham
[1:15:20] considers the Bible as his absolute
[1:15:25] hallelujah now someone has been many has
[1:15:29] been saying to me and theologian said
[1:15:32] brother Branham if the Lord God said if
[1:15:35] with your experience that the Lord has
[1:15:37] given you for his people humbly saying
[1:15:40] this that you would be eligible to write
[1:15:43] a Bible yourself your word
[1:15:46] if God has manifested now they were
[1:15:52] saying after observing Bertram's
[1:15:55] ministry then you are eligible to write
[1:15:57] a Bible yourself I said that might be
[1:16:01] true see he was trying to catch me and
[1:16:05] I'm said it was this guy was trying to
[1:16:07] catch me said I said but you see I
[1:16:10] couldn't do that what I couldn't do that
[1:16:15] I couldn't add to the word or take away
[1:16:18] from the word I need to stay with the
[1:16:21] Bible that's the Word of God hallelujah
[1:16:24] he said why couldn't you you have all
[1:16:28] the qualifications Parabellum you have
[1:16:30] all the qualification you qualified to
[1:16:32] write the Bible yourself but I said but
[1:16:36] kill look one word cannot be added or
[1:16:39] taken away see better ban him the pillar
[1:16:46] of fire was upon him and it said this
[1:16:48] Alleluia
[1:16:50] but her Branham crossed all the
[1:16:53] wildfires hallelujah it's a wrong
[1:16:57] thought next line this is the wrong
[1:17:00] thought he said well then seven thunders
[1:17:03] you see said wouldn't them be seven
[1:17:06] thunders blasting out
[1:17:08] wouldn't that be a revelation given to
[1:17:10] some man this was the question
[1:17:13] better BAM said no sir it would be
[1:17:17] adding something or taking it or
[1:17:19] something away taking something away
[1:17:22] from it it's all revealed in there
[1:17:25] talking about the Bible it's all in the
[1:17:28] Bible it's all revealed in there
[1:17:32] hallelujah thank you Jesus it's all
[1:17:37] revealed in there and the seven seals
[1:17:39] opened up the revelation of what that
[1:17:41] was then it said he's still the word you
[1:17:46] see you cannot get out of that word it
[1:17:49] won't leave that word and God's Spirit
[1:17:52] will never leave that word it will stay
[1:17:55] right through the word blinding some and
[1:17:58] open the eyes of others it will always
[1:18:00] do that amen hallelujah do we have the
[1:18:07] word
[1:18:08] if we have the word it will still stood
[1:18:11] do the same thing blind the eyes of some
[1:18:16] even and give revelation to the others
[1:18:19] who give faith to the others hallelujah
[1:18:22] and hybridizing will always produce that
[1:18:27] next life and when the church today
[1:18:31] that's called themselves Pentecostal
[1:18:34] call themselves Baptists and whatever
[1:18:37] they want to when they hybrid this word
[1:18:40] with Dogma it produces
[1:18:42] a red child and she cannot have no life
[1:18:46] in her she's dead and her children is
[1:18:50] dead God said I'll throw her in a bed of
[1:18:53] worldliness and kill her children God
[1:18:55] said so in Revelation
[1:18:59] how many knows that's true because a
[1:19:02] hybrid person or a hybrid thing is a
[1:19:06] confused creature next next slide
[1:19:10] anything hybrid is off the real main
[1:19:15] beaten road we ought to have a little
[1:19:18] time to talk on the original scene see
[1:19:21] where it comes from
[1:19:22] hybrid don't know where it belongs
[1:19:26] it don't know who his Papa was who his
[1:19:30] mama was or nothing no he don't know he
[1:19:34] has no pedigree he can't have a pedigree
[1:19:38] he can never breed himself back that's
[1:19:42] why a Catholic will produce Catholic
[1:19:46] custom it converts and a Baptist person
[1:19:50] can produce Baptist people Pentecostal
[1:19:54] followers will produce Pentecostal
[1:19:57] people hallelujah but the Word of God
[1:19:59] will always produce sons and daughters
[1:20:02] of God hallelujah Amen hallelujah not
[1:20:08] the hybrid but an original gene that
[1:20:13] comes from God sons and daughters of God
[1:20:16] manifested on this earth in this age
[1:20:20] this is the last life hybrid people
[1:20:25] cannot breed themselves back hallelujah
[1:20:30] that's what the matter with the churches
[1:20:32] today they cannot breed themselves back
[1:20:35] they are a hybrid they don't know
[1:20:38] whether they belong to God or some
[1:20:40] denomination only things that they can
[1:20:43] produce is a member not a Christian I
[1:20:47] believe maybe I ought not to have said
[1:20:50] that but it's already said that's right
[1:20:52] he don't know what he belongs to
[1:20:56] he just knows that he's a Methodist
[1:20:57] Baptist or Pentecostal
[1:20:59] that's only knows what about some
[1:21:02] message believers some message believers
[1:21:05] that's the only thing they know is there
[1:21:07] part of the message movement I'm a
[1:21:13] message believer I'm part of the bride
[1:21:15] that's all you know that's all you know
[1:21:19] it's a hybrid religion it becomes just
[1:21:24] another brand you need to have the real
[1:21:30] experience the real fire coming upon
[1:21:34] your soul hallelujah and quickening that
[1:21:38] word into your heart to make you
[1:21:41] understand and clearly see what God
[1:21:44] intends for us to do the message came to
[1:21:48] give us rapturing faith to make us all
[1:21:52] ready for the rapture let us be certain
[1:21:56] let us know that we stick by it and not
[1:22:02] be trying to add our own concept our own
[1:22:06] interpretation our own tangents to the
[1:22:09] word but let's stick to the word what
[1:22:13] the messenger has given us in our aids
[1:22:16] because this is the only hope for the
[1:22:18] rapture you can you can have the wrapped
[1:22:21] you can help rapturing faith by going to
[1:22:25] about this church by listening to a
[1:22:28] catholic theology rapturing faith is in
[1:22:33] those tapes the messages of the hour
[1:22:38] amen thank you so much god bless you
[1:22:44] we don't want any strange spire
[1:22:47] behind this pulpit below one and it
[1:22:50] strains fire you want the real fire that
[1:22:53] comes from God and it's still here it's
[1:22:56] still burning oh god is still anointed
[1:22:59] people minister to picture the whole the
[1:23:02] two the two anointed word of the hour
[1:23:05] the word and and the fullness of the
[1:23:08] word and nothing but the truth
[1:23:10] hallelujah god bless you say Amen let's
[1:23:27] give our brother a good how much you
[1:23:31] appreciate these messages and what he
[1:23:35] stands for
[1:23:36] to try to not have no hybrid religion
[1:23:40] but we don't need that we need the
[1:23:44] genuine don't let's all stand together
[1:23:46] go right into her communion
[1:24:00] first Corinthians 11:23 I have received
[1:24:07] her the Lord that which also I delivered
[1:24:09] unto you that the Lord Jesus I'm not in
[1:24:12] which he would which he was betrayed
[1:24:14] took bread and when he had given thanks
[1:24:17] he brake it and said take eat this is my
[1:24:19] body which is an is broken in for you
[1:24:23] this do in remembrance of me after the
[1:24:29] same manner also he took the cup when he
[1:24:31] had supped saying this cup is the New
[1:24:34] Testament in my blood this do ye as oft
[1:24:37] as you drink it in remembrance of me
[1:24:40] where as often as you eat this bread and
[1:24:43] drink this cup you do shew the Lord's
[1:24:45] death till he come wherefore whosoever
[1:24:48] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:24:51] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[1:24:55] of the body and blood of the Lord but a
[1:24:57] little man examine himself and so let
[1:24:59] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[1:25:00] Cup for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:25:02] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[1:25:04] to himself not discerning the Lord's
[1:25:07] body for this cause many are weak and
[1:25:09] sickly among you and many sleep first we
[1:25:12] should would judge ourselves we should
[1:25:15] not be judged now that loved this part
[1:25:17] of the scripture but when we are judged
[1:25:19] see even if we're judged we are
[1:25:24] chastened of the Lord that we should not
[1:25:26] be condemned with the world wherefore my
[1:25:28] brethren when you come together to eat
[1:25:29] tarry one for another anything any man
[1:25:32] hunger let him eat at home that you come
[1:25:34] out together and the condemnation the
[1:25:37] rest I said in order when I come let's
[1:25:40] just have a moment of silent prayer as
[1:25:42] we remember to pray one for another and
[1:25:44] in taking that little time to to
[1:25:47] remember each other and to Lord let the
[1:25:51] Lord this be with all of us amen
