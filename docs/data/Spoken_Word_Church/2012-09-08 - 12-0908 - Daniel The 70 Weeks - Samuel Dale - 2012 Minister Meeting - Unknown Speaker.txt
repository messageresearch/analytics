with the lord because that's our whole and entire purposes unity of faith unity of the Spirit of God so we're not here this morning to promote anybody or anybody's ministry where we are here promote one individual and his name is Jesus Rory that's what we come together or we don't come together for you know what we an honor of a man but just a man president this morning as we started off brother Samuel Dale that you want to go first or are your soon whether Samsung start off and we're talking about Daniel 70 weeks the whole purpose of this is to Daniel's understanding gang of 70 weeks and this is the first time we have recorded any of the ministers meetings and the purpose of that of this is because it's very much of teaching setup so with teaching we've got some brothers that desire to be here for the bill has already mentioned the two brothers and they have supported the meetings and they could not be here so they have requested to get recording and also the speakers were the salmon or the wages are how these recorded for posterity so that if somebody says we you said so and so we can pull it up and say this is what to say it so that's the reason it's being recorded we don't completely normally recording with that may be changing is as a mistress region has moved forward so you ready brother Rick hi god bless you okay let's stand together and readers Richard get readily into the topic I have a bunch of quote here if any of you want there will be the exact quote should we be using today so if you want you could pack them out not enough for everybody there is a few that you can do let this do as the Prophet said nobody heaven tried to open the loop or try to read it if you have permission from the author so let's pray Lord Jesus we thank you for the day at a time do we have yes and praise song has blessed us now your understanding of he has court help us to say what you would have to be saying yes forgive our sins cleanse us and keep us recorded in your loving grace in Jesus now Wade Guthrie you may be seated wake up you're reporting the reader scripture comes tasting wake up record want to go off the internet think that their brother and Iran has been released are in James hey okay everybody for me it was Richard here at the Daniel 9 24 70 weeks are determined upon my people on that holy city to finish the transgression to make the end of sins and to make reconciliation for iniquity and bring in everlasting righteousness and civil division and profits into the north of of holy know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build jerusalem unto messiah the prince shall be seven weeks and threescore and two weeks the stream shall be built again and the wall even in troublous times actually restored to which of his hobby cut off not for himself but not for himself and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city in the sanctuary in the end thereof shall be with the flood and at the end of the war desolations are determined and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week and the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation deceased and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even unto the consummation and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate and you may be Z now the first thing I don't like is mine and one we bought one message I thought hey me we have one absolute which is the word and we believe the one that brought us the word to be the Prophet this in huh so what he says it does matter with me what you say or what outside right all right guess what he said all right I think what we got to say about we are sheep we have no rights what brother up to you what I think that's what will get through and go into the message and show it that that's what a lot of people get your own ideas I mean when they do if it's a messy profit ok if not but I do not want to try to correct anybody know there's no way for us to correct this message was made to live a not correct just to say I'm going to correct you I know what is taught not we're all still learning but just keep that in mind out of what we're trying to do is to look at it and remember he was the prophet but around the message is supposed to be our absolute right and then we must believe what he says no matter what we think because you know yourself that run arounds message was contrary to our understanding i would say ninety percent of us but i do this to win 200 for him then because we didn't know right there in the truth the latter we were one is your Trinity we were still missing it yeah it didn't matter what I you were missing it until the Prophet Kenny so then when we read what the Prophet says take what he said even though it don't mathematically count even though it don't physically look right it has to be that point so then let's do this is take what we can and try to you know if I say kinds there contrary to you I'm not contrary to nobody I didn't come to argue i come to state what I believe all right now here's the problem i see with the ministry most preachers men tell you fully what they believe because they will withhold enough until they can float around and I don't everybody knows me I'm glowing I'm flying if you like it time if you don't like it you pray for me come I accuse what I gotta work them God's Word is the truth though carefully dumb donkey tail today that's right it's not rude right a monic now in doing the Atlas let's just make a few little statements and just give some things starting he said well why is it so important for us to understand Daniel seventy weeks you know do we have to understand it well maybe all of us movement don't have to understand the total mechanical but if it was not meant for us understanding why would it be brought yes can I all right and I'm going to make a statement like there's people that tell you all about the seagulls and can't tell you about that insinuate sure now let's read what the prophet said so let's start with quote number one unless they want to see it now if I don't read the whole thing you read it all walks up there I'll just get washed up raised up than you you know you do it revelation this apartment of 71 that Gables instruction now to unless a this well i'll be using the tendon of the two thousand converts okay the computer verbs of 2010 all right now there is some differences between the 2010 and the 99 the parents are different not necessarily wording but even they change some words it's different but you will use this because that was to get us home to the internet system it's easier to use because the brewers talking to that list alright well look what he says in revelation 6 190 21 is connected with the city of weeks and therefore we must stop and explain before we go further we must gotta explain one of these 70 of weeks cause if you don't you miss those seals like I said everybody knows all about sales but don't know about daniel said you ate well how can you do that is that too hard I didn't say it he said you missed the seagull if you missed the trumpet you missed the bottle you mr. play you missed three unclean spirits like frogs the three roads the caching down red dragon the woman in the Sun you miss it all because it don't cut here in this 70th we go it takes place right here and it's ending if we that's where it takes place now everybody knows the first CEO bought viable product oh yeah what was wrong what do you understand what he just said he just said we can't understand the sweet on to understand and seventy weeks now so then what are we trying to do we say well is it important i believe all the first important anytime and then you'll say bro brother Dale and will give a drawing of a second well I take what run around and said I to the seal clubber over what he said before the road you know are the 70 weeks now are you the problem no not dinner so we have no rocky you can make that statement because if you say we take after the seals you know that means you believe before the ceiling was not correct right now let's read what better have said about ninety seventy weeks who had not to look what he says and I do not believe that there's one person here for that perfect I believe that we're here or not because we're deadly sincere honest and wanting to know thus saith the Lord now that was wished on 60 per paragraph 22 go to the end I told him kid that coming up your ass if I get started with say not see if I move on to another go down Tom I gotta get in a hurry if I get it by forwarding a to my father oh look what he said well he gets to on further one can that's the reason we're praying for God to make that so perfect then that there are be not one shadow out the god murder nosipho put our own interpretation to those things it's got to come through the SAT the Lord so I'm leaving it right there until I understand Ned this is off of the 70th week that much my say on the old the 99 version like those say the same in weeks of that right but when you get into the 2010 it's at the 70th week those that still even covers seventy weeks of Daniel but when they've done this 2010 version the freedom emphasize on that where you won't say he's using something different this is the version so look what he said perfect 191 the safety of we condemn I wish you'd listened quietly now just for a moment the moment he starts the cydia tweak or seven years the church is done now listen I'm quoting again recording so you won't forget this is what the Holy Spirit put up on my pen while I was riding when he says it must be thus said the Lord yeah and he said they put on his hand that about we gladly accept voting her original seat when he said oh dear Tony pick up my right we accept that at being the staff the Lord but do we accept this is being ok now let's go to the net let's see what you actually said these things are paragraph 14 understand me is weak now today and we're approaching what is the 70 weeks this is a very bottom part the 70 weeks and we know that the scripture cannot lie we have to be true and if the same angel Gabriel coming to manually the terms only 70 weeks left for the Jews then we would apply that to six days or seven day week but in prophecy it's always feel incredible right yes right you remember Matthew 1334 all things were spoke Jesus unto the multitude in parables and without a parable speaking on to them so the whole message is in permanent amen the whole bottle isn't her say me weeks is in power so now what is a hard thing but the definition of apparel is a figure of comparison the proverb they placing them one thing by the side of another due to this potion will affect us at work which means it's outside and off ships invalid way to get some of these other words when he gets up but the best definition you can define of apparel is like the silence they said teach other stairs Jesus would give up early but you know what do you have next line man that's right what do you mean you plant leaves you get beings run you know the Pharisees kind of figured out Jesus don't nothing that's right you know the next on matters the Americans a long story go to crops with an underlying meaning that can even be a little different then the meaning over here you'll see in a minute on the drawing government said this line should have went straight across that Israel but then you see the church age is injected by joe parr now so we're going to take dance in which is apparent join we say my name 10 remember the prophet is speaking in prayer to hide it from the wise and prove that's right and here's the statements a lot of you know it even a brother just recently put out a big high pony that contain you 70 weeks was so messed up in the dates and the night until you can't understand well he's not the prophet amen we just really gonna run City so what God put on his pin we just read is coming to set the Lord to a prophet or what's becoming right now don't know get them within their own way you said well though they was thankful around in understanding the only thing he didn't understand was the wipers rider my authenticity and then no lot of they were shining so he wouldn't responsible to seal throat okay you were not responsible for that white horse rider GT is being wrong until the seals broke then he was responsible that's right huh that's why said you say what I say I'm responsible alright so the output in the ports along the way like that but if you know mm I just like to say funny this is not a new doctrine to me this is 40 years a priestess in 1974 still have the cage and we do have some types priest in 2005 if you want you can take them and listen to them dissectum Tarla do whatever I would just listen if you want you don't want to forget that's just you know it's just one won't them taking let's get started look what the prophet said the reason this is done why is it done in parables was it done you know that these are that you why is it like 28 days in some months and 31 days in the next month and different times he's in the same delete Savannah right why is his done under way notice what he say but that was all done than the great economy of God to keep the church Washington pray being ready having their garments washed in the blood of the Lamb you mean God would deliberately do that yes you would deliberately do that Deuteronomy full of the night Deuteronomy everybody knows if 13 1 through 3 are arriving on your prophet or a dream or drink and give it the assign or Wonder and the sign or the wonderful pais where I'll be spake unto thee same let us try for other gosh you remember the two scriptures what they've done Elizabeth they use the wonderful profit prophesied and it comes to pass all right I'm in addition said if it's if he prophesied he gives you a sign that it comes to pious why would God allow that but there's your answer now shall not hearken unto the words of that rock or that dream of dreams for the Lord your God prove with you to know whether you love the Lord your God with all your heart with all your soul that's my time he loves to do that where he is immortal catchy you know that you know he loves to do up something he's gone all right go to the next this tea time immoral I'll give this a point for you to look at the sea and he said he puts these trials he said about the bottom he sends these trials to test you to prove you to shake you up and to give you you about you hope you know somebody else tear you up miss coach belong you know mice won't move in now about 10 and 15 years we have no real big battle all it once we're getting together a few what not stirring all right what do you think about it so now let's go into the day of 70 week with this thought in mind apero the daniel said before hundred and ninety years will really miss Porter not even judicial right all right right now I ask you to check this the only kind of runaround ever talks about 490 years to Israel is in the Daniel 70 week series okay if you can find it out of the head I've gone for 90 years a different in the data seven weeks he explains the 490 years but he doesn't do that again cuz it we've done for one time the parable is given for one time for you to break your neck trying to figure it out and the Bible tells you the products that people have gone crazy trying to figure it out oh yeah 490 years do is we get to it in a minute getting an odd comparison that Jesus at any time you forgive seventy times seven of course both to again from and actually all right let's don't leave it on 70 times 7490 colonies isn't in there leaving they asked to have identities most forgiving 409 times without the mask so I that odd the house there'd be four hundred ninety years and there's four hundred ninety years to digital yes and render we're talking about Israel man we're not talking about Gentiles will kill absolutely go ahead brother and pull up to the trauma to the children now I all the copy in my body he now received in 1967 or 1968 in Jeffersonville it is this drawing now there are arguments about that draw be I won't get in trouble voting somebody else oh I won't quote the brother but we've received information stating this was exactly the drawing that brought it out of night like I said I've had months at 67 probably a lot of you have that drawing was there even to the little battle under works at four and thirty four years a little bit of writing according to the brother his wife said she wrote in sometimes so there is another one where the line comes around the lights of circle in BO the man standing there there 77 on the line you probably seen that one there are on now in the Philippines that i'll show you that drawing in just a second not from the filling and then I don't have it from there but it's not you know I'm just saying that they see by the other yours but look like run around and say now you said well we all know who that was great all right now I'm telling you I believe that's wrong is exactly the bottom if you change it in one detail you're not in the scripture amen that is the drawing the Prophet money and that is what he taught so there is your three witnesses as to it being correct all right so now that what it says it's divided into three periods time the same is weaker than you are about 61 I emphasize at the end you look on your book it says sailing with the dining with this is the new version that is the 70th week the cover he says it's three periods first a seven-week period then a three-sport doing period which is 62 noon and then one week period they're divided into three periods till you look at the drawing is divided into three periods and they said we're under that outfit what I believe I'm sorry it didn't fit me when I was in the baggage and that prophet told me I was a bastard born child if I didn't get out of that each you know all right here's what most people think brother random draw if you'll notice I got on better what some people believe if you'll notice from the original draw we'll get back to it he gives 69 weeks to the cross yeah now I'm this drawing the only thing we didn't do grill joke and I'll pointed out of my shirt we should have pulled their over to right here okay because that's what you think the drawing don't you think that's what brother let them talk you think he called 69 five weeks 69 weeks use in administering may be thrown out of here and which 16 out of the high then his only 1i wait left over here that's what you've done me said the worst drug and worse the problems Mason chilly one will be ordinary ever say sixty nine and a half weeks to the rock we will show you 69 weeks approach but i'm helena showing because i'm not beach if I'm ride hallelujah brother news if I'm wrong and you grabbed me how are you I will take the wreck but you gonna have shown you about him not your idea but my opinion I don't give a hoot what's your opinion is God don't deal with opinions hey Leo with his word hey alright so that's why people bank run around said they kinda he brought up 62 weeks and then Jesus preached three and a half years and then maybe threaten iphone on your side now there will recite this over over but Iran never preached but seven years of Jesus's ministry to relight it back that threw a knife over here and I try but around never preached no word but three and a half years of Jacob's trouble on the tribulation right I want to see huh so that's what people say he was look back up to the original misty verify C divided into three weeks seven wheels 62 weeks 69 he engaged dot out dot out and he sanity he put the cross haiti journey now brother Dale as Ronald much they need 33 look at that second so we'll run around change his mind I want to know for a change I'd go with the nation look there's exactly 49 day 49 years rather in the time of the building of the temple then we'll start right to her and say well the Jews according to John it with what a second that John says that you said to Jesus that they would 48 six years in bill in the temple remember that John two and twenty remember Daniel 925 said and the walls and the streets were built yeah it took 40 26 years in the temple park but the finishing of the structure around made it up to 49 years reaching about right see those Jews thought that was smart they thought they understood but did the understand oh they were right technically but they didn't fit the rest of trip see our salad and prophetic weeks in the beliefs of our seven weeks determined to the rebuilding temple and it was building exactly 49 years now are you going to listen to the farae city use with the 46 or brother Brennan for the 49 and what I mean by that the Pharisees today they want to tell you okay see March 14th he knows exactly bc 538 until temple was restored again and the streets which restored exactly 4900 so what do you hear what do we get in seven weeks means 49 years then one week equals seven years seven times 749 just exactly our yard now there are no more question about it we know now that each week mid seven years have you got it let's say it together one week equal seven years all right he said well I know these things are no a quick let's get it money he learn about I semester to enjoy an unusual thing now let's get started on something now we're totally going forward progress in the eighth cydia tweak of the commitment that years were work trouble you were troubling now we're totally going for the commandment to rebuild it city to Mossad and Mossad was Christ of course silly seven weeks and threescore two weeks making 69 weeks CRI in 69 x 7 x 69 equal 483 years now you're getting it down if you want way to run over be glad to they worked over the going forth of commandment the city to Messiah shall be seven and then he goes to explain in 249 gonna sell them aside coming up to his part all right go to the name this is paragraph 80 and watch this one now this would be released the men good men conjure but what's the point I gravitate either 70th week of Daniel now now Jesus Messiah wrote into the city of Jerusalem driving on the back of about you on Palm Sunday a millisecond 80 dirty and we'll get to that later he's oh he goofed up there will he goofed up in the seal book and he goofed up in question tonight 64 okay we will explain these in the point we can now time are 80 Jesus rode into Jerusalem on Sunday on Sunday of 11 Sunday before the crucifixion you're great Palm Sunday and then crucifixion was in that many roads to that Sundy I would say but here in the next week watch that is a second now watch but if we have already seen that's a 69 weeks makes 483 years now that our swear there trouble comes right back we got only with the marking of the bottle time only for 75 years and actually it's 483 years now he didn't sacred moved up he said actually at 483 years right but never survey years and what's the problem now God can't make it hit and if he said he would be so many days and seventh day and said so much it's so much to where we're going to do now the bc 4 75 to 80 30-hour Julian our astronomy earth which is 400 365 before but when we reuse that to our prophetic calendar now watch this mathematical calculation 475 x 365 for 25 which is one-fourth right three other 65 or four days in our calendar 360 noon and comes out I can't be pronounced it won't that be 170 3493 for savings up yes that's right up by giving a hundred thousand earth 10,000 you read that all right / Horner about 360 you get what he's doing he says we got to go by prophetic counter you divide that by 360 and look how close brother Brennan was terminally mathematica he was 480 1.9 2708 33333 43 in other words 482 year yeah yeah he said well he still needs to the year thank you the calendar was challenged three-count a mean the counters of niche NE Gregory what is the other Alexandria mystery other in one year they had 13 months to make the start line back up when they change the calendar in another year they had 200 30-something days in that year to make the calendars on it so brother Alan was walking even mathematically was one year off the one against it now he said gods did put into prophetic calendar it's 483 right they read it right there but here on the court 75 and actually it's for an 83 so whatever we think I just give you these calendars and thanks to have you mind God what's your mind over say the Prophet said it you know right see they ought to be done that way all right now let's go to where we gonna do a mission 1 ok let's go to this this is part of 86 there's new day to day four yep I my 34th and our prophetic calendar brains do witches and continuation are coming down for more retrieved and I am very vain and our prophetic calendar right in 30 60 days that we use down the scripture we have exactly one or 83 years 30 of 43 here we have exactly proved by the Prophet proof of the prophecy exactly the truth are from the economy going forward to build a temple on destroying our when they rejected Christ and killed him in a t-33 now he just said the quote before then he wrote into Jerusalem on Sunday per second maybe 30 now if you've words later what does he say see now but the point he is getting that and didn't they rejected Christ and kill him in a t-33 when Christ was killed in exactly four to make three years yes while another drawing was at them people say well he come in here at 80 30 in India crucified 1933 but you see church what is look at your phone to rebuild the temple 434 years and for 34 years of a 49 things exactly 483 years the 480 threefold four and eight forward so you know what that English get hit on my nose fine so now though go to a number which is a continuation paragraph he said numbers continue an 84 in two days it and God had an Olympian and the living world is toward the water a change you're on a date and then let the Romans come in and make up the calendar which hits and jumps and so forth and guess that in even in the encyclopedia where I've been reading I throw out the calendar get everything doing what you're doing reading between to all be there there it is exactly one day three years from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to restore and build till the time of the Messiah was rejected with 483 years by the calendar now whether you think it or not you got to stop and watch say 483 years if you add three and a half years to that you're 486 and a half it will calculate so now we got to find that one calculate go back to paragraph eight wrote it a little bit harder they all right now Jesus Messiah run into the city of Jerusalem come from the back what you up on sandy hey Ellis Adam maybe 30 he said well he just goofed up did you give them before we show the other part let's just really he gives down now remember hey I was sad part of sunday money would be the third Tuesday would be the fourth remember that neck as he told up okay we going up to 20 hi I appreciate he broached do anything but I can do not lead anyway but look what brother Ron Cey questions answered on the seals 1963 after six had been briefed he says and you know that Jesus was flying about 1830 is that right he was about the middle of the year I he s leading 30 and the Bible said that he was flying before the foundation work no no go to the mansion look what he said on the sixth seal prior 148 now let's go there these three persisting who you know what he's answered the asking three questions and eventually right actually on Tuesday afternoon April of 4th 83rd who did he give about earning a difficult here go to look at what I told you remember the other one said he wrote into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday haila saket now he's saying april afford all right mind you would have been the third tuesday would have been there for blood runs exactly right he said yo how can that be a 30s and all of us at the other arm go ahead we've got that somewhere there it is your timeline comparison if you would take that we'd be glad to give it to you see our calendar system is all mixed up we started at one in Kenya Jesus would hold on and I'm saying whoa love you this is my quote run around never say it Jesus with 14 BC he never said but if he say he was crucified 1830 then you can argue point but look he according to the theologians and scholars and whatever you want all that we have it well you can take it away Testament so look at it one line runs in the college I started 0 the other one life runs in the cross of doing so a 830 according to Jesus born for bixi run around with give me the Jesus was crucified Navy third right when you come in our calendar system then begin with the one thing you have Jesus being crucified 8033 Joey's it exactly right so you can say thirty or thirty 30 in which calendar you you going to which system you're using to prove your point right save-a-lot phone he is he was even to the number yes i hain't blue second of 18 before that he done he knew exactly what he was doing he said well I don't understand let me ask you a simple question you believe will go into the Prophet did Jesus now say on the prophet because you know the world will group according to the Prophet Jesus was born an end right they are you mom Bradley here hey hi whether you want to go to 32 dr 30 he was crucified Him ankle Amy never your mathematical calculation running

the Jews I've brother just get rid and you listen how close we are nice weight 77 here so here's what people miss them and so are you trying to say that there is one week left you know seven years but rather dig the remedies according to his drawing he did it according to the Bible Daniel 9 35 26 to me salad and they all know that words if you confirm his chemical wheels because a double come down meaning it means crossing at me the anti-graft because i'll ask you a question where did God ever like a covenant for seven years now you run that he might have come a fraternity that's right he's just coming back to the Jews he put a gap in the time he coming back to the Jews all right so then we got lonely bad now although that was all the three I've years later listen what's your profit in the same moon de menthe and here we go we got it through here to the projection on the side and front of rejection of the side the last week and I won't stop right darling cuz the woman talk to you right here just a moment and when they received by the Mossad was when they of course rejected Jesus that standard and crucified so what did he say before then if crucified 80 dirty then you come on

has cut off then God returns to the Jews next none now 70 weeks determined upon the people in Tamil it for seven years ago so we know we've got seven years for the Jew can you come down explaining the cutting off in the doing okay next how close is it coming the Lord of rapture in the end of the pendulum the moment he starts that 70th week are seven years the church is gone Haley are you counting three four five times okay go to the sea went all that back will be way to this can you see a shrink what is the rest he says raise your hand if you can see well just a few hands but most of you afraid raise your hand those are you afraid of what I'm talking okay but probably not only through in a hag quote to start with there's never being the Prophet never talk seven years of Jesus's ninja he never called but three and a half years to jacob's trouble of the tribulation you still have that went away it's this afternoon and Brian to cross I mean after I get through okay that's it and what's this product or not he said these safety nine workers we're going away from us confuse me the church and everything alright the moni start staying at week are seven years the church has gone now here's the one that we ask you want to go think about i'm quoting again ring quoted so you won't forget it this is what i put on my pin the ride right so from your own you're questioning with a bread around right charlie right your question will go to run from your question thing i'm just reading your dressing in whether he'd rather he said it with wonderful experience p next you comin shows what an opera did I never said the door Tony was standing and morning and i'm coming down awkward eh i don't know why i'm saying it but I predict that that'll all happened between right now 1933 1977 not knowing yet God's knows my heart I never noted until yesterday nineteen seventy-seven in 70 jubilee in exactly the same amount of time without that he gave with Israel and they were going at the end and then we are here at the end of the age at the coming in our 70th week okay next paragraph 80 removed that while ago go to the more to go with it all right now 83rd I'm April second 8030 but we have already seen to 69 weeks my 283 years dogs for the trouble we come in we gave the answer to that part he said so much and said God can't make it miss 475 of 1830 our duty nurse on the years we've been through that go to the next coming through an attorney Atlanta 32 here's a little thing is going to reverse back to me to go rid of 300 years of men in seven weeks the last half of value of 70 weeks which is three in one I here Oh coffee snap when let's rinse it having remembers from the church edges you see there are 70 weeks to turn EG how perfect it was misawa's got off and he'll be cut off for a sacrificed in the midst of the week and the oblation we'll see if you put it back in there totally to understand that you one you would type the first draw it and you have 60 99 leave it was a lady Maureen going Jesus will be he preaches you the two witnesses 42 and I for 390 and then it's cut off who give you a quote me know look let me get something jump over to 34 run this is and look what he said her graft routine and try to let your father in the city of weeks you ever notice the statement they say there were determined 70 weeks that's seven years brother brendan is not calling it 490 years he's dealing with exactly what you're reading off their Messiah cut off etc he's dealing with Jesus's ministry 70 weeks seven years no Louis so that's where you missed the power the prior belief 490 years the underlying meaning is Jesus's ministry for seven years three alive backpack three and a half over here yeah the greatest peril of all the is we are the ones are a recipient of it let's see any honda city then that's 34 except out of this back tire here 64 question of the manager is real too now I know some orange got a new question 11 brother random dear you're wrong on the 70 weeks of Daniel that will still be 70 weeks no the Messiah was to come to prophesy and in the midst of the 70 weeks 70 of weeds which is seven years net worth what I'm doing 36 here is the one everybody lies so let's take place in the Masters when you ran out City which was that Lily automatically jump for this right this is the quote everybody goes through 64 question unanswered real three run around when you gather makes go to 70 weeks now 70 church winter send we Department of Daniel I believe that you mention that the pool the life full week our lifestyle in the earth will begin when the bride was taken up in the rapture now what's rather an adventure no no no no no you have it wrong not to fool seven weeks the week started when Jesus didn't win the earth he said to massage shall come and prophesied mr. the seven weeks he'll be cut off in Jesus priest exactly 3 15 years which is high for the 70 ways a seven-day weeks we've made a nice three and a half years later you say that corrects Daniel 70 weeks that's what you're saying you're saying that quote correct Daniel 70 week that he told level seven years after break he what you're saying the reason I just ready through quote were 70 weeks even seven years every one of those quotes is related to the ministry Jesus Christ oh there's only seven years of the Ministry of Jesus Christ you're going to have a better three life and this answer to this question is answering exactly the Ministry of Jesus Christ written the Ministry of Jesus Christ three and a half years of a tire tread on here okay okay see all right what is it hidden so what about your own food others named what number 37 and I'll say a few words and waited Oh 37 you got very silly when I'm bullet both the questions and answered root for okay we sent over 38 excuse me now i'm gonna go to go to every question answered Ruffo are you look what he said if you ever want to know what order of elysium's heard of this page agree you want to avoid come to actually as I say this after the second is that please read this quote the church Etienne in the black powder rajkot we have already entered into the Tribulation Period that's the question density he said no no no I wish I could just have more time and actually the bride when she's taken from the earth then the church age whoopsies legacy of Govinda chaos the prime note no glory and the Tribulation Period sets in upon the sleeping virgins for 35 years while Israel is getting her prophecy three night here look at you drum your profits going right back and still at 64 the two witnesses bringing the prophecy desk all right so rereading and get sleep in version four three and a half year while Israel is getting there if the prophecy the anti tribulation sets in upon the integral and then he knows the Battle of Armageddon where does he have the Battle of Armageddon and then the Bradley Kurds back at the room for a thousand years what from judgment at seven what run around so confused the brother on the video Nevada you saying I'm sure he said it was so lastly confused of dates and times until you couldn't take it big man in his message said one time and i hurting her would say he said if the Feast of the trumpets was so messed up until you could not understand someone's taking hits and mr. hurry said you can't understand what he say read that book he said this is thus saith the Lord but you know why the trouble run around seven please through the trumpet he said between the sixth and seventh seal a profit comes to the Gentiles you said that what I smell it up no six seals throwback dire try six seals would priest by Jesus between nine comes the Prophet all right to get it done there is one thing in brother branham where he says if we want to pull these up on his run through he says it from 1933 1977 likes 154 year if you can mathematically counting a very that's nothing 44 dirty 377 1944 but remember the calories you change three times we take his word genetic quote pulled up with that gives work Amy whatever he said we take or we don't believe in to be a prophet from come on triage this is one down before and the quote i made was the bride goes up revelation for one and not single not between one we never had the rest of the meeting because the argument was over will the bottle down bored this is out of order that that should be here that should be there but it runs at the end the button is in place alright this is the one time that we read it to pull up paragraph what is it 31 in one more must be the boys 29 buddy hem its paragraph 1 98 for the 70th week there's one little point and then i'll quit even have 20 when you get ready look I program says he's talking about a year he said don't miss it what would I what was 97 I mean 77 what happened it's it instead some of you lady would ready to seen you look like that was when they became vital to me very important to me because I had already preached in 1974 and I have the touch

me might not agree with it now here it is breezy other than church for a today 1977 around said what would be he'll be saving a few days at the beginning of two believes don't miss it it'll be the Jubilee other going on the jet down pride return a crisis used for the glider body the Jubilee not a year not a time back at down on the other day there you go from the first you leave a little bit of

Leviticus 25 10 the rats who would have a habit come in 77 that's how technical ugly because 2510 says a 50 a 49ers to sell in church energies and we have a profit become the brightest the message in this church a we are still at the lady in cas whether you like it or not the Lady of cah will continue only in and connect to the millennium will you have it or not those quotes of the Prophet true
