[3:57] name amen
[4:00] Joel
[4:04] 2 we start reading in verse
[4:09] 25 and I will restore to you the years
[4:12] that the Locust hath eaten the
[4:14] cankerworm and the caterpillar and the
[4:17] pommer worm my great Army which I sent
[4:19] among you now God didn't send that like
[4:23] making it come he permitted it to come
[4:28] into being it's not like the reading of
[4:30] it is saying my great Army which I sent
[4:33] among you uh you know now he allows
[4:37] things to come to drive us to
[4:39] him and permit those things to happen
[4:42] all right and you shall eat in plenty
[4:45] and be satisfied and praise the name of
[4:47] the Lord your God that hath dealt
[4:49] wondrously with you and my people shall
[4:51] never be ashamed and you shall know that
[4:53] I am in the midst of Israel and that I
[4:55] am the Lord your God and none else and
[4:57] my people shall never be
[5:00] ashamed okay let's go over to
[5:04] Luke 1 and we'll read 35
[5:12] through 34 then said Mary unto the angel
[5:15] how shall this be seeing I know not a
[5:18] man the angel answered and said unto her
[5:20] the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and
[5:23] the power of the high shall overshadow
[5:26] thee therefore also that Holy thing
[5:28] which is shall be born of thee shall be
[5:30] called The Son of God and behold thy
[5:33] cousin Elizabeth she hath also conceived
[5:36] a son in her old age and this is the
[5:38] sixth month with her who was called
[5:41] Baron for with God nothing shall be
[5:44] impossible and Mary said behold a
[5:46] handmade of the Lord be it unto me
[5:49] according to Thy word the angel departed
[5:52] from her you may be seated the Lord add
[5:55] his Blessing to the reading of the word
[5:58] now trying to get a point to
[6:01] us you know about why a the prophet
[6:05] would speak of the carriers and even
[6:09] call the denominations the carriers and
[6:12] and uh would call the prophets carriers
[6:15] and and I was noticing one there today
[6:18] he said we are
[6:20] carriers all right that's right
[6:23] now that is you know the point of
[6:27] understanding it is look at the grain of
[6:28] wheat that one grain goes into the
[6:31] ground it comes forth in uh you know a
[6:34] multiple form yeah but what does it come
[6:36] forth with the two little shoots come
[6:38] up Joel is saying I will restore so then
[6:42] the two shoots comes up that's that's
[6:44] the that's your grain right you know
[6:47] that's that you say but but no it's not
[6:49] grain now that mean it's not reusable
[6:53] grain it's not capable of being planted
[6:56] but it is a wheat field of grain you
[6:59] know cuz that's what it is it has to go
[7:01] through those things to come up you just
[7:04] don't see a uh put a grain of of corn or
[7:08] wheat in the ground and you go out there
[7:10] and look and they just a bunch of wheat
[7:11] you know grains just jump up out of the
[7:13] ground it has to have a way right to
[7:16] come forth and that way then when it's
[7:19] used and comes forth it will come forth
[7:22] into the correct way it's supposed to be
[7:25] all right because that corn of wheat we
[7:27] know was the Lord Jesus Christ the son
[7:29] of man he had to die and go into the
[7:33] ground all right then he came forth in a
[7:35] multiple form on the day of Pentecost
[7:38] but we know that that then had to die
[7:41] and go into the ground to to be able to
[7:43] come over where we're at because if it
[7:46] had not have went into the ground you
[7:49] say well why did it have to go back into
[7:51] the ground well then you and I wouldn't
[7:52] be here right amen right simple language
[7:56] plain sensible think about it you not I
[7:59] wouldn't be here if they' went right on
[8:01] there in the book of Acts and brought it
[8:04] forth and the opening of the word would
[8:06] have come come to them and you and I
[8:08] wouldn't be here so we better thank God
[8:10] that there is these things but the point
[8:13] I'm wanting you to see
[8:15] is that God done it that
[8:20] way to where that it would bring forth
[8:24] and we know and we've studied it that
[8:26] it's got to go back to the original
[8:28] grain
[8:29] that went into the ground right all
[8:32] right not saying that Luther wasn't
[8:34] grain he was he was wheat amen wesle was
[8:39] wheat yeah right but not in the the
[8:43] finished product all right the cornstalk
[8:48] it's St it's
[8:50] green and I trying to explain our Sunday
[8:52] and in this plane the natural that that
[8:57] cornstalk it comes up all of that stays
[9:00] green amen until finally all of the life
[9:05] is pulled up into the corn after the
[9:08] corn forms in the
[9:11] Shook and each one of those stages has
[9:14] to be there right if not you would not
[9:18] have an original coming back that's
[9:20] right it must have those stages and it's
[9:23] I wrote down in my notes like this that
[9:26] it's not just complimentary every how
[9:29] you would make those big words to the
[9:33] bride of Christ to talk about being
[9:35] grain and being carriers it is very
[9:40] complimentary amen it is very uh
[9:44] wonderful for us to watch and see the
[9:47] the stages of the thing and realize that
[9:50] God kept his word right you know to say
[9:54] I will
[9:55] restore all right so he's going to bring
[9:58] it back
[9:59] to the
[10:00] original and in doing that somebody had
[10:04] to make manifest each
[10:07] stage
[10:09] right now so if it's coming back to the
[10:12] original grain that went into the ground
[10:14] somebody's got to make it manifest
[10:18] amen but I wrote this down just as a
[10:21] thought brother and I were talking a
[10:23] minute ago about something and I said it
[10:25] this way to him the people will say but
[10:29] I I I just don't see things going
[10:33] on if if we was where we thought we were
[10:36] we would see great things taking place
[10:39] you know what the trouble is you right
[10:44] there now get upset with me do all you
[10:47] want to but that's the truth you are the
[10:50] one that's causing the trouble when you
[10:51] have that
[10:54] idea do you think the children of
[10:57] Israel was really happy and glorious and
[11:01] the preachers was preaching and God's
[11:04] going to send us a
[11:07] deliverer don't you think that they told
[11:10] him about it through the 40 years they
[11:11] were
[11:13] there come
[11:15] on they knew the
[11:17] scriptures the scriptures said a
[11:20] deliverer would
[11:23] come
[11:25] right but was they glowing around Glory
[11:27] Hallelujah Del is coming look at all
[11:30] this oh we know it's
[11:32] here they didn't even accept it when it
[11:35] got
[11:36] there that's right that's right they
[11:39] turned down the
[11:42] deliverer and had to wait 40 more years
[11:46] well was that 40 years good
[11:51] things how would you like to been back
[11:53] there when when you was making clay and
[11:56] bricks and doing that and then Moses
[11:58] come along said we're going out of
[12:00] here and then they reject it and they
[12:02] didn't do it and then you know what
[12:04] happened the taskmasters begin to make
[12:06] them go out and get their wheat and
[12:08] different things and you know that's
[12:10] right probably killing a lot of them to
[12:12] make them
[12:14] work see we think it's supposed to be a
[12:16] Glory
[12:20] Hallelujah when we're the
[12:25] unbelievers
[12:27] right
[12:30] it doesn't make no difference what what
[12:32] happens or don't
[12:34] happen you can be a one
[12:39] person cuz that's what the prophet said
[12:41] God's waiting on one
[12:43] man you know the were revivals always
[12:45] been sprung by one man that's right one
[12:49] person or one lady that was cleaning the
[12:51] pews in the
[12:53] church all right see we've had the
[12:57] profit thank God
[12:59] he brought us the word
[13:01] right all
[13:03] right but that Prophet is the one that
[13:06] said the bride would have to become the
[13:09] word
[13:11] amen well I just don't see it
[13:20] well as I said when Moses was down there
[13:23] they shouldn't they wouldn't too
[13:26] happy and 40 years later they did
[13:28] definitely wouldn't happy
[13:31] right you say yeah but we's
[13:34] promises and it's taking place around
[13:36] the world
[13:38] right all right but think about
[13:42] it whose fault is it that we don't
[13:46] see God
[13:50] moving I've had this throw it in my face
[13:52] for 40 years so it don't make no
[13:54] difference you know yeah but we're
[13:57] supposed to look and I do right I look
[14:00] for great signs and wonders but you know
[14:03] what even the Lord
[14:06] Jesus had to leave a city one
[14:10] time is that right right right
[14:14] why because of their unbelief he
[14:17] couldn't do any Miracles there God
[14:20] himself amen I'm not trying to justify
[14:24] something This is 40 years that I've
[14:26] been preaching it to you so it's not
[14:27] something to say well he's trying to
[14:29] make an excuse no I've been in a Revival
[14:33] 40 something years I don't know about
[14:35] you I'm in a Revival every day when God
[14:38] opens his word to me and shows me his
[14:40] word right amen what kind of a Revival
[14:42] are you looking
[14:47] for but see that offends people and they
[14:50] get all upset at you because you just
[14:52] expose the things you
[14:55] know but see everybody wants that
[14:57] they've got it figured out out to be a
[14:59] certain way well you know what when we
[15:00] get it figured out to be a certain way
[15:02] it's not going to come that
[15:04] way
[15:06] right it's going to be his way and he's
[15:08] going to do it all right right and I
[15:11] believe he's doing it don't you I mean I
[15:13] believe it if not what are we
[15:21] doing brother Brown says you sympathize
[15:25] with the
[15:26] message what does he mean by that
[15:29] right you sympathize with the
[15:33] message you know that means you don't
[15:35] take it for
[15:37] nothing but you you go along with it
[15:40] because you know that there's some
[15:41] things of it so what does it mean
[15:43] sympathize with
[15:45] it right and you see church then when we
[15:49] do we we wind up blaming everybody else
[15:53] instead of looking to our own
[15:57] selves it's it don't matter how what
[15:59] everybody else
[16:01] does it's what we're doing that's right
[16:05] amen all right see that's all I've ever
[16:08] tried to get us to do is to look at it
[16:10] correctly and to see the hour that we're
[16:14] living because each age had to find the
[16:18] message of that
[16:21] age that's right and they rallied around
[16:25] that message of that age yes sir right
[16:28] and they made manifest that message of
[16:30] that
[16:31] age and the prophet said and we'll read
[16:34] it tonight where he says in the
[16:35] Masterpiece he said it's up to the bride
[16:37] to vindicate Malachi 4 Luke 17:30
[16:40] Revelation
[16:45] 10:7 but see we want to blame everybody
[16:49] else instead of just simply going along
[16:53] and just trying to move along right and
[16:56] be what we're supposed to be right
[17:00] I've never tried to to to bring anything
[17:03] other than the word of God to you and I
[17:07] yeah but we just word word word no we
[17:09] don't have no life that's your
[17:12] fault you tell me we don't have no life
[17:15] that's your fault that's
[17:18] right come on you admit it by
[17:21] questioning
[17:23] it because you see I believe there is
[17:26] life amen that's right
[17:29] all right but I I thought it'd be that
[17:32] that's where Eve thought that too you
[17:35] know she kind of got confused on Hebrews
[17:38] 13:8 is that what the prophet
[17:41] said well you know evidently we could be
[17:43] confused on
[17:46] that but you see I'm wanting us to see
[17:49] what it is why would a prophet
[17:52] call Luther wesle him
[17:56] carriers y
[18:00] see that looks like it's
[18:04] degrading no if you've read what I've
[18:06] asked you to you've seen him speak of it
[18:08] being like that and speak of
[18:10] denominations and that but you've seen
[18:12] how great he spoke of them too that's
[18:15] right
[18:19] right think about it
[18:22] then stages or whatever you want to call
[18:27] it you got the stalk the tassel the hus
[18:30] and things you know coming down and it
[18:32] comes down to the
[18:34] Shu well you know each one of them is
[18:36] valuable right
[18:38] amen you don't go out there when the
[18:40] corn gets ready that you can start
[18:42] eating and we explaining something you
[18:44] don't go out there and take it all off
[18:45] and go throw it in the barn they
[18:47] rotten you got to leave that until it
[18:50] dries the life comes up through
[18:53] everything and goes out into the seed
[18:56] amen what don't you believe that's the
[18:58] day we're in
[19:03] right but as I said then we if we would
[19:06] back there with them and well I I just
[19:08] don't see nothing going on here comes a
[19:10] man walking down through there
[19:13] yeah he's leading a little old donkey
[19:16] with a child sitting on there and his
[19:20] wife evidently there must have been
[19:22] another child born on the way cuz he
[19:24] winds up with two children somewhere in
[19:25] the way he left out with one and
[19:31] how many people do you think KN knew
[19:33] Moses was
[19:37] there probably very few
[19:40] right oh they heard of about these
[19:42] things but they heard of them
[19:45] before but see who kept it from them the
[19:48] religious leaders right right but
[19:52] listen it was the life I have tried to
[19:56] explain it
[19:59] it's the life so what we're going to do
[20:01] tonight we're just going to read a bunch
[20:03] and then you you you can't say that you
[20:05] didn't hear what he said so watch let's
[20:08] read a little bit I told brother Joe
[20:10] would be pretty bad cuz he ain't got
[20:12] Brother Anderson but I think Richard
[20:13] went back there to he so got Josiah he's
[20:15] running to stick to keep up with me so
[20:19] you know I told him I said we're going
[20:21] to probably read
[20:22] tonight but look what he says number one
[20:25] of the
[20:26] Rapture now a lot of these we had them
[20:28] Sunday and things but I just want you to
[20:31] think about the Rapture message
[20:32] paragraph
[20:34] 115 preach 1965
[20:37] 1204 now the life that come up through
[20:39] Luther was what made
[20:42] Wesley right the life that come out of
[20:45] Wesley is what made
[20:47] Pentecost the life that comes out of
[20:50] Pentecost makes the
[20:52] wheat but they're carriers see the real
[20:56] life goes through that
[20:58] see what you want to do is you want to
[21:00] your mind goes that well everything back
[21:02] this way is
[21:05] carriers well it becomes that but it
[21:08] remember when it was green it was a
[21:09] carrier yep right I mean we're in the
[21:12] fall of the year there's no leaves on
[21:13] the tree but the tree is not dead amen
[21:18] it's said dead is what people look at it
[21:19] but it's not dead Li in the
[21:22] ground right right well look the real
[21:26] life goes through there the message goes
[21:29] through but it's heading up into the
[21:32] wheat that's the reason the wheat come
[21:34] up and brings the whole thing in the
[21:36] Rapture right up here at the top see now
[21:40] you go cut that off down to there and
[21:42] you can't bring up nobody right right so
[21:44] don't cut the stalk down leave it alone
[21:47] look the bride itself comes out of each
[21:49] age but the denominational stalk
[21:54] dies now the stalk will eventually die
[21:57] the shu dies the the silks dies all of
[22:00] the thing will eventually
[22:02] die but inside now not inside of the
[22:06] stalk you can't take the stalk and plant
[22:08] it you can't take the Shu and plant
[22:11] it that's righten but you take the corn
[22:14] and plant it that's right right is it
[22:17] sensible see the denominational stock
[22:19] dries dries up and dies have you noticed
[22:22] this last days it's begin to pull away
[22:26] now when that wheat begins to grow then
[22:30] the shook begins to get away from
[22:33] it all right you look back there in the
[22:36] day he was
[22:37] here and they rejected him right right
[22:42] CU as I was explaining there the other
[22:44] day are trying to blood of random was
[22:46] part of the body of Christ amen why he
[22:48] was greater than all the prophets he he
[22:51] had more gifts he was in the body of
[22:52] Christ so they was pulling away from
[22:56] him right right right the one man that
[23:00] had the ability so watch as it goes on
[23:03] now look what he goes to Masterpiece
[23:05] 6475 paragraph
[23:08] 129 the wheat after the tassel after
[23:11] Wesley puts forth the husk which is the
[23:13] foremost like the Grain and anything El
[23:15] of anything the husk is more like the
[23:17] grain it's coming more like the grain
[23:19] all the time the one that went into the
[23:21] ground and when it comes forth the stalk
[23:25] it's got life in it right STG got life
[23:28] in it but it sure isn't the
[23:32] grain Right comes forth a tassel the
[23:36] pollen it still isn't the grain you
[23:39] can't plant as it said the tossle the
[23:41] the stock the thing then it comes forth
[23:43] the husk and it's just in the shape of
[23:46] the wheat just exactly like the grain of
[23:48] wheat but yet it isn't the wheat just
[23:51] exactly in the shame the same shape you
[23:53] know why because it's housing around it
[23:56] is why it's in the same shape right
[23:58] all
[24:00] right but look what he goes on to say
[24:02] now in the seed not air with the shook
[24:03] paragraph
[24:11] 9798 and and so does the seed other
[24:15] denominations persecute the genuine
[24:17] grain it's got always got to be that way
[24:21] they'll not be ARS together they're not
[24:24] associated together they're absolute two
[24:28] different promises two different times
[24:30] two different people all together one is
[24:33] the bride the other is the church no
[24:35] comparison at all with
[24:38] them well what about a stalk now comes
[24:42] up and it's green and it's got life a
[24:45] tassel a shook Etc it's got life it is
[24:49] the true
[24:50] bride and it's day but when it
[24:53] denominates and dies and dries up see
[24:56] then it becomes a church
[24:58] right right that's right watch but still
[25:02] they are not the seed that's promised to
[25:06] come well they wouldn't see brother D no
[25:10] he's not explaining that I've been over
[25:12] and over said neither was Sarah neither
[25:15] was and neither was Hagar neither Sarah
[25:17] or neither Mary was the seed Mary was
[25:21] not the seed she was a carrier of the
[25:23] seed but she had nurtured brought forth
[25:26] out of her womb just like the shook
[25:28] brought forth from its womb the real
[25:30] seed but the shook is not the seed it
[25:33] only is closer to the seed it hugged up
[25:36] around the seed way back in the stock
[25:38] the life is scattered all throughout the
[25:40] stock okay life is done and when it
[25:43] comes to the pollen it's Gathering down
[25:46] closer but when it comes to the Shu it's
[25:48] right down there like the seed and it
[25:51] forms almost like the
[25:53] seed but why would he be speaking and
[25:56] and speaking and comparing ing Mary or
[25:58] comparing Luther with the the stalk and
[26:02] and and Wesley with the
[26:05] the corn coming and going for and then
[26:08] Pentecost with a shuck and say they
[26:11] wouldn't SE well they're not you can't
[26:13] plant it that's
[26:17] right you know there's no way to plant
[26:20] the
[26:22] stalk but yet at the time it was the
[26:26] carrier of the life
[26:28] there's no way to come to seed without
[26:29] the stalk being there amen that's right
[26:33] and don't try to cut it down now let it
[26:36] try and dive its
[26:39] own that's right when I come in this
[26:41] message you know what most of you know
[26:43] remember the big fight back then was to
[26:46] fight denominationalism boy everybody
[26:48] was against
[26:49] denominationalism that old Antichrist
[26:53] system and brother R going out there
[26:55] every day and preaching to him
[26:58] right Y and calling out
[27:02] people right that's right are you
[27:05] thinking about it but once but see they
[27:08] they are not the seed that's promised to
[27:11] come right that's
[27:15] it now there's many promises in the word
[27:17] of God and those promises will have to
[27:20] come to pass right right now we we got a
[27:23] choice of whether or not we're part of
[27:24] it right but they will come to Pi right
[27:27] yeah it looked bad when they rejected
[27:30] Moses right 40 years later it looked a
[27:32] whole lot worse but God still kept his
[27:35] promise
[27:40] amen it look bad for you and I but God's
[27:43] kept his
[27:44] promise but one is the bride and one of
[27:47] is the church the church dries up and
[27:50] dies but the bride comes out of each age
[27:54] coming on down all right simple church
[27:58] when we look at it but thinking about it
[28:01] see Mary he said is not the seed now why
[28:05] would he be saying something like
[28:07] that and saying that Mary represented a
[28:10] zeusa street Pentecost you know come in
[28:14] down because she was not the seed that's
[28:18] right the seed was in Mary right she was
[28:21] a carrier right so Had Each one been
[28:25] carriers right
[28:28] but you couldn't cut it down while it
[28:29] was in the stalk form you couldn't cut
[28:31] it down even while it's in the husk form
[28:33] you can't cut it down even after the
[28:35] corn forms until it lays in the presence
[28:38] of the sun to ripen as the prophet would
[28:42] call it but we know what is doing laying
[28:44] in the presence of sun to dry right
[28:46] right right cuz you can't plant green
[28:49] corn right you know that stuff you
[28:53] probably had for supper tonight you know
[28:55] the canned corn the corn you know and
[28:57] you can't plant that no that's
[29:00] right it's got to dry amen and do all
[29:03] the things but look what he says now
[29:06] let's go on the seed not a with a shook
[29:08] Los Angeles California
[29:10] 64429
[29:13] B and finally upon the Earth came the
[29:15] genuine image of God himself again which
[29:18] was God the Loos was made flesh and
[29:21] dwelled Among Us now that same logos has
[29:25] a
[29:26] part he has got a bride and the same
[29:30] logos this word that cannot be tampered
[29:33] with is brooding over the church
[29:38] today trying to bring back the word to
[29:42] its full manifestation watch which the
[29:45] prophets was carriers to that seed
[29:49] because they were not the
[29:51] seed Moses was not
[29:54] God you said what he was God to the
[29:56] people that's F but he wasn't God
[30:00] no he wasn't the god of the people right
[30:04] what prophet carriers to the seed and
[30:06] the church denomination has been
[30:08] carriers to the seed see that's what
[30:10] people can't swallow let's just leave
[30:12] that out of there because them
[30:14] denomination that been well where did
[30:16] you come from that's right amen what
[30:19] church did you come out of true amen
[30:22] putting that on the internet putting it
[30:23] on everywhere what church did you come
[30:25] out of
[30:28] well I never was a Baptist I just
[30:30] visited
[30:33] there can I quote brother
[30:35] randam he said I carried a Baptist
[30:40] Bible and quoted them and converted them
[30:44] to a Baptist
[30:49] Faith y but see we're so well we never
[30:54] was you see people today you know and
[30:57] you remember it took you 20 years to get
[30:59] them out of their thoughts and ideas but
[31:02] yet they never had no bad thoughts all
[31:04] along okay rooing over the church to
[31:07] churches today trying to bring back the
[31:10] word to its full manifestation which the
[31:11] prophets was carriers to the word and
[31:14] the church denomination been carries to
[31:15] the seed now notice quickly but like
[31:17] this Shu hugs holds in the seed now then
[31:22] it leaves
[31:25] her right
[31:29] you see as long as we stay in the stage
[31:32] of
[31:34] carriers we're not manifesting the day
[31:38] that we're living they already have had
[31:41] those
[31:43] days right the prophet has had his day
[31:50] right when are we going to realize our
[31:52] day right
[31:56] right and and try to to walk into it to
[31:59] make it manifest
[32:01] going this is prag 77 see not a to shut
[32:05] Los Angeles California there's two of
[32:07] those messages remember now Mary was not
[32:10] the seed she was only the Shu through
[32:12] the
[32:13] seed the two others were carriers of
[32:16] Life only the natural seed Mary was not
[32:19] the seed herself but like faith in God's
[32:22] word brought a more real image of the
[32:24] word because he was the word
[32:27] but like the shook the uh of wheat or
[32:30] corn of wheat the shook holds the wheat
[32:32] inside of it and protects it until it is
[32:35] able or matur to go on its own come on
[32:39] now see then it was the seed itself that
[32:42] left
[32:44] her she gave birth
[32:50] right that's why she's not dead she's a
[32:53] carrier see just like the seed was in
[32:56] her Wom wounded she wasn't the seed she
[32:59] didn't produce the seed God is the seed
[33:02] amen that's right all she could do was
[33:06] say be it unto me according to Thy
[33:08] word now bless God I I found it okay
[33:11] Mama Told Me Mama told me because I got
[33:14] one in here in a minute where she says
[33:16] that her mother was Anna and Anna told
[33:18] her and she'd read it in the
[33:21] scriptures but that wasn't alive until
[33:24] that angel spoke to her amen all right
[33:28] listen go on God is the
[33:31] seed all right look at the seed not
[33:33] there with a Shook and Jefferson fi now
[33:34] 65 to9 28 uh starting with paragraph 99
[33:39] she was not deceived Mary was not just a
[33:41] shook tassel talk carriers of part of
[33:44] the
[33:45] word
[33:48] right that's right not all the word
[33:51] Luther had justification West had
[33:53] sanctification Pentecost had to rest in
[33:54] the gifts but when the word word
[33:59] come now what did I explain the other
[34:01] day I tried to what made them
[34:03] denominations is when they turned this
[34:05] message down right amen they started
[34:10] dying right
[34:13] there
[34:15] right now they could produce that that
[34:18] justification will save a man right
[34:21] it'll work you believe that sure it was
[34:23] a carrier of the word just the same as I
[34:25] believe that the stalk is part of the
[34:26] wheat sure it is but it's a carrier it
[34:29] ain't the life see the life is in it
[34:32] it's not then Al comes sanctification
[34:34] how many believes in sanctification you
[34:35] believe the Bible you have to so so
[34:38] still that's not it's a little more like
[34:41] that's two more words but then come the
[34:43] Pentecost the restoration of the gifts
[34:46] speaking in tongues they call it in the
[34:48] initial evidence of the Holy Ghost
[34:49] speaking in tongues there they called
[34:51] the initial evidence which brought forth
[34:53] the what the
[34:55] shook but they they
[34:57] denominated all right now
[35:00] watch but when you come to say I and my
[35:03] father are one when
[35:06] you and say when he or brother brandom
[35:10] or what see that's what everybody wants
[35:12] a whole thing I'm just sitting around
[35:14] waiting because brother Brown's done
[35:16] done it
[35:18] all
[35:20] well keep
[35:23] waiting we've been around here 40
[35:25] something years I was thinking about
[35:28] today 40 something
[35:33] years you know we started here July 4th
[35:39] 1971 look where we
[35:42] at but yet people think I'm exalted to
[35:45] say in 1969 that I preached the bride
[35:47] would be the son of man the fullness of
[35:49] the godhead bodily would be in the
[35:52] right they don't people don't want to
[35:54] hear
[35:55] that
[35:59] that's over 40 years then I'm not you
[36:02] think I'm
[36:05] worried I said then it would have to
[36:07] come and you know it's on tape that the
[36:10] biggest portion of people this message
[36:12] would die and go by the grave now you
[36:13] know that's on tape here 40 maybe 30
[36:15] years ago at
[36:17] least well you know what if time don't
[36:20] something don't happen pretty fast you
[36:22] and I going to be them
[36:25] people
[36:29] right all right but says when you come
[36:32] to say I and my father one and these
[36:35] other
[36:37] things now you know you can interpret
[36:40] all you want to they no need of it these
[36:41] other things what the whole message
[36:44] right then the shook pulls away from it
[36:47] but the real genuine bride church will
[36:49] bring forth the entire word of God in
[36:52] its fullness and in its strength for the
[36:56] same for he's the same yesterday today
[36:58] and forever notice in the wound of Mary
[37:02] was the
[37:04] seed but when the seed was
[37:07] delivered Mary never said I come to do
[37:09] thy
[37:11] will right Mary didn't say that that's
[37:14] what Jesus
[37:15] said I come to do thy will do the will
[37:18] of him that sent me I am my father one
[37:20] Mary never said I my father
[37:23] one come on if I do not hear Works
[37:27] believe me not th was the seed which one
[37:29] of you can condemn me of unbelief you
[37:32] can go through the me and who it is and
[37:33] all this going up notice and in the
[37:36] Pentecostal age through the Lutheran age
[37:38] through the wesle age it's been the same
[37:39] thing through the pent Pentecostal age
[37:41] and notice but at the opening of The
[37:43] Seven Seals Revelations 10 the full word
[37:46] is to be born into manifestation again
[37:48] and Vindicated by the spirit of God in
[37:51] full the full strength as it was when he
[37:54] was here on
[37:55] Earth manifested in the same way doing
[37:59] the same thing that he did when it was
[38:02] here on Earth amen Hebrews 138 Jesus
[38:05] Christ the same yesterday today and
[38:06] forever and in Luke 17:30 Jesus said in
[38:10] the days as as it was in the days of
[38:14] Sodom when the son of man will be
[38:16] revealing himself again to be the same
[38:18] thing right look what he
[38:24] saying look at the next one see not air
[38:27] with a shook number
[38:30] seven paragraph 105 denominations has
[38:33] been the been the carriers of part of
[38:39] it part that is the
[38:41] word Luther had the word Wes had the
[38:44] word Pentecost had the word but not all
[38:46] of it come
[38:49] on for it has been hid from the wise
[38:53] reformers or the sealed away from them
[38:56] un until the age of the Eagles appear
[39:00] check that and see to make sure that he
[39:01] says Eagles on there okay the Bible said
[39:04] so yes sir because we're promised that
[39:06] in melachi 4 exactly we are he hide it
[39:09] from the eyes of the wise and prudent
[39:11] and if we just went through the Book of
[39:13] Revelations we find out that ever all
[39:15] three of those messengers of those
[39:17] beasts that went forth each one suited
[39:20] Luther just right and each one suited
[39:22] the other one just right which is the ox
[39:24] and the different animals of the Bible
[39:26] they went forth in justification
[39:28] sanctification even into the
[39:30] Pentecostals but the force was an eagle
[39:33] that's right and through that age God
[39:35] raised it up so it has to come through
[39:38] the age to be correct yes sir the eagle
[39:42] promise being fulfilled of Malachi 4 cuz
[39:46] brother Brown's a part of it right Jesus
[39:48] was not of
[39:54] Mary well why I don't understand it
[39:57] because he come out of
[40:00] her if Jesus was of Mary that'd make
[40:03] Mary
[40:05] God read in the book that's what he's
[40:07] explaining you people that think
[40:09] that Jesus was not of Mary but came
[40:12] through Mary like the life come through
[40:15] the shock go ahead we'll try to read
[40:19] fast paragraph
[40:24] 129 once the carrier of a true word
[40:27] justification then it become a carrier
[40:30] of sanctification it become a carrier of
[40:31] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[40:33] restoration of the gifts but then when
[40:35] he goes on and keeps going back try to
[40:39] eat something Mana from another day is
[40:41] rotten it's no good a genuine Eagle of
[40:44] this day knows that was all right but we
[40:47] got that
[40:49] plus until Jesus Christ is made manifest
[40:52] in the fullness of his power as he
[40:55] promised to be in this last
[40:58] days okay what about it it's a
[41:03] promise well I just don't know whether
[41:05] that's going to be or
[41:06] not your Prophet said it's a promise so
[41:09] okay I'm going to stay with that you can
[41:10] do what you want to look the next
[41:15] one let's see wait a minute I got 149
[41:19] yeah okay I got them listed on nine and
[41:22] going up down notice there will be no
[41:23] more
[41:25] carrier mother
[41:27] churches
[41:29] denominations after this carrier
[41:33] shook
[41:35] right there's no more carriers after the
[41:38] shook
[41:41] right all right so now wherever we're
[41:48] at it's getting close ain't it because
[41:52] after the Shu there is no more nothing
[41:54] left by then but just the grain is that
[41:57] right it's got to be grain it's got to
[41:59] be the same kind that went into the
[42:00] ground Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[42:02] today and forever a Spirit come upon the
[42:05] bride to do the same thing that he did
[42:07] see it's the reproducing again of the
[42:09] grain that's right reproducing again of
[42:12] the grain what is
[42:15] it it is the rising of the
[42:18] Sun that goes through uh okay let's read
[42:21] that one because this is part of part of
[42:23] that that we was on so look then what is
[42:26] it now we must be the father be about
[42:29] the father's business the wheat would
[42:32] cry
[42:34] back now we'll get to it the Lord
[42:36] willing Sunday how
[42:38] that what speaks of him speaks of
[42:43] you right so look what he's saying wheat
[42:47] would cry back the grain yes sir what
[42:49] must it do vindicate Malachi 4 vindicate
[42:53] Luke 17:30 vindicate Hebrews 138
[42:56] vindicate St John 14:12 vindicate all of
[42:59] his
[43:00] word vindicate Hebrews I mean
[43:02] Revelations the 10th chapter of the
[43:04] opening of The Seven Seals the mysteries
[43:06] of God even to the serpent seed and all
[43:08] that would be made manifest all right
[43:11] going to the
[43:14] next number
[43:17] 10 you see this is the rising of the sun
[43:20] see it's not just Masterpiece and SE not
[43:22] there with a shook that you're dealing
[43:24] with all of these things of carrier and
[43:26] what it is and the word and the it's the
[43:28] whole message that's the divine
[43:30] revelation of the word made
[43:32] flesh if it was flesh in that day by the
[43:36] son the groom it's the flesh today by
[43:39] the bride right see whosoever sins you
[43:43] remit to them they are remitted
[43:45] whosoever sins you retain to them they
[43:46] are retain now the Catholic Church picks
[43:49] that up and they say well we got it but
[43:51] said watch it was the spiritual revealed
[43:53] word that did it I said
[43:57] right the spiritual revealed word that
[44:00] did it Feast of the trumpets 1964
[44:05] 719 go into the prophet's chamber and
[44:07] watch them seven steps where did the
[44:09] where did the guard meet the challenge
[44:12] challenge to bring the comer into the
[44:13] presence of the king at the top of the
[44:15] steps was in the seventh step there
[44:17] shows that we've got to come again with
[44:19] the same spirit that was on John we've
[44:22] been through that right he introduced
[44:25] the Messiah he was greater than all the
[44:27] prophets he introduced it and we've got
[44:29] to come to a place again to something
[44:31] that's going to introduce the Messiah
[44:32] we've been through that brother R him
[44:34] introduce the message to you and I right
[44:36] right so look what he said how will the
[44:40] Messiah
[44:41] watch the P people that's believing him
[44:45] know it unless other words how will the
[44:48] people that's believing him you know
[44:51] know it unless they're constantly in the
[44:54] word to know what he is Daniel said the
[44:57] wise shall know but the foolish the
[45:00] unwise would know they shall know their
[45:04] God now wrote it up a
[45:07] little now now he how he shall appear in
[45:11] the last days is to bring the people
[45:13] back to the word so that the bride will
[45:15] know their husband right know her mate
[45:18] the reveal word that's why this has to
[45:20] happen so we've had to introduce
[45:24] her come on the prophet came and done
[45:27] his job to introduce the word he brought
[45:30] the word amen to introduce Christ to you
[45:34] and I we don't have to have another
[45:36] Messenger
[45:37] right or somebody to help figure that
[45:40] out well he should have said this maybe
[45:42] if he' said that we' understood better
[45:44] if he oh it was said exactly the way God
[45:46] wanted it said that's right all right
[45:50] amen watch it wasn't in the reformers
[45:54] wasn't in Luther Wesley and the
[45:55] Pentecostal them scriptures say it
[45:58] wasn't but it will come that he has
[46:01] promised for this age we're living the
[46:03] age that his coming will be in she must
[46:06] be identified in
[46:08] him in him come on any woman must be
[46:12] identified with her husband for the two
[46:14] or one and Christ bride has to be
[46:16] identified with him for the two or one
[46:18] and he is the word not the denomination
[46:21] the word we are to be the children of
[46:23] the light and the light is the the word
[46:26] which is to be which is made light for
[46:28] this age how do we know light except it
[46:32] comes from the word all right the word
[46:35] made flesh is the light of the age when
[46:39] you see it right and the Bible said so
[46:43] so what is it when you see
[46:46] it
[46:51] okay go ahead to the next one number
[46:54] 12 the identified Masterpiece of God in
[46:57] Yumi Arizona 1964 12:05 so you see he
[47:02] has cut wants to cut the church out just
[47:04] like he did the son out like he did the
[47:06] bride and the groom to be his bride you
[47:09] must be part of him what not a part of a
[47:12] Creed not a part of the church not a
[47:15] part of the denomination but the the
[47:18] part of him H out of any other kind of a
[47:22] form won't work H out of that won't work
[47:25] you got to be hewed from the word the
[47:28] world cut off from you and just leave
[47:30] the word
[47:32] only alive in you the great scripture is
[47:35] counting on you willing to stand and to
[47:38] have yourself shaped into the likeness
[47:41] of his
[47:42] requirement that his word requires in
[47:45] the last days I pour out my spirit upon
[47:47] All Flesh your sons and your daughters
[47:49] shall prophesy Christ is identified
[47:51] Masterpiece of the word made flesh you
[47:54] are asked to be a identify as to
[47:57] identify yourself in him by the same
[48:00] word to be the Masterpiece for the bride
[48:04] you see Church why did I fought so hard
[48:06] and screamed and hollering about these
[48:07] doctrines and things of the
[48:11] message to try to keep you and I from
[48:13] getting into those garbage
[48:16] cans that has taken this message and
[48:19] twisted
[48:21] it perverted
[48:24] it and I don't mind standing and saying
[48:27] it you think I'm off you're Duty bound
[48:29] to come to me no you'll go talk to
[48:31] everybody else and tell everybody else

[49:04] silly attitudes and my ways of do
[49:06] it I'll talk about your silly attitudes
[49:09] and your ways of do it and that won't
[49:11] get us
[49:12] nowhere show me where that word says it
[49:15] that I haven't stood for
[49:20] it come
[49:22] on but look go to the next one
[49:28] I know that don't make me very
[49:30] popular spoken word Original
[49:34] Seed paragraph 135 through I think it's
[49:38] 139 the true bride Hallelujah there's
[49:40] going to be one
[49:43] why she's
[49:45] predestinated she won't be denominated
[49:48] cuz she's
[49:50] predestinated right right but's see
[49:53] their word is predestinated right
[49:56] see she don't have to worry about some
[49:58] denomination she's already predestinated
[50:00] to take the place look like
[50:04] Mary now I want you to get this now and
[50:06] don't fail are you ready say they said
[50:08] amen when Christ comes to his bride she
[50:11] will be a virgin like Mary was for God
[50:14] will not bring Christ through the wound
[50:15] of a and neither will he bring the
[50:18] bride he can't bring his word through a
[50:21] of his word them is horrible words
[50:24] but that's what the Bible says I'm
[50:27] saying what it says because it's this
[50:30] has got to be understood amen the
[50:35] prove true
[50:36] bride like Mary will have a virgin wound
[50:40] for the Bride of the word which is
[50:42] Christ now let me ask you a simple
[50:47] question if we're to have a virgin W how
[50:49] are you going to get
[50:54] one
[50:57] well brother so and so is going to stand
[50:58] up and speak it we'll all just get
[51:00] one
[51:03] goodbye get out of the garbage
[51:07] can it can only be the revealed word
[51:10] that can set any of us free righten
[51:12] that's right you can argue all you want
[51:13] to about anything it's only the revealed
[51:15] word can set you free whether it's a new
[51:17] birth or whatever it is
[51:20] watch when Christ the word comes to his
[51:23] bride she'll be the same as as he is a
[51:25] Virgin by the word oh God I hope it's
[51:28] going over brother Neville you see I
[51:30] hope you understand what was he word the
[51:33] word of God upon his vesture he had a
[51:35] name written the word of God in the
[51:37] beginning was the word word was with God
[51:39] and the Word was God and the Word was
[51:40] made flesh and dwelt Among Us he is God
[51:43] and God is the word when his bride comes
[51:46] she'll be the same
[51:48] product there he is
[51:52] Virgin did Christ belong to a
[51:54] denomination
[51:56] did Jehovah neither does his
[51:59] bride she is part of him she needs no no
[52:03] Dogma she won't have any she'll be
[52:06] absolutely virgin how by the word amen
[52:09] she'll punctuate every word of God every
[52:12] word God Says with an amen amen oh be it
[52:16] unto me according to Thy word amen my
[52:19] there you are punctuate God's word have
[52:24] a virgin
[52:26] wound what will she come out of a virgin
[52:30] wound the word what did Jesus come out
[52:34] of a virgin
[52:37] WB right what will it
[52:41] be let's see I think that's all on
[52:47] that but what I like it she's the same
[52:50] product all right virgin woman okay go
[52:54] ahead this is paragraph 2 11 of the
[52:57] spoken words Original
[52:59] Seed
[53:01] listen oh my mother is a blind
[53:04] woman now Anna was her
[53:07] mother and you're talking about Mary
[53:11] right you remember blind Anna was Mary's
[53:14] mother all right listen my old mother is
[53:18] a blind woman but she's a Godly woman to
[53:21] her lips she planted a seed in my heart
[53:27] I quoted that to a man one time he
[53:28] ridiculed me for 30 minutes about he is
[53:30] tired of that old mother Doctrine
[53:33] about how the mama was a doing
[53:36] this
[53:37] okay we planted a seed in my heart I've
[53:41] read it out of God's word that God said
[53:44] in Isaiah 9:6 a virgin shall conceive
[53:47] that's right so when the angel will come
[53:49] all he had to do just tell her what y
[53:52] right come
[53:54] on
[53:56] look at the next one restoration of the
[53:59] brid tree want to say it's not just in
[54:01] the couple of messages it's just those
[54:04] that trying to relate it you need to
[54:06] listen to the restoration of the Bride
[54:07] tree you need to listen to spoken word
[54:10] Original Seed but what he was God's
[54:12] perfect Prophet tree the example tree
[54:15] the bridegroom tree amen glory going to
[54:18] say something
[54:20] directly if he is the bridegroom tree do
[54:23] you believe it congregation said amen
[54:25] from the Garden of Eden amen then the
[54:27] bridegroom tree without the female won't
[54:31] bear fruit so he's got to have a bride
[54:33] tree she has got to be born of the same
[54:38] material the word made flesh in the
[54:42] tree is that the same material hope you
[54:45] get it it's the same life in this female
[54:47] tree the bridegroom as it is in the
[54:50] bride The Works that I do shall you do
[54:52] you shall that I do shall you also is
[54:55] that right amen he was a bridegroom
[54:58] remember on to the next
[55:00] one see not there with a shook paragraph
[55:05] 130 this is in Los Angeles California
[55:09] see it's just simple just like in this
[55:11] just like watching the corn grow you
[55:14] don't have to have some great
[55:15] theological interpretation of it just
[55:18] watch it you're he's right around you
[55:22] all the time see I got to stop I felt
[55:25] the little pool and somebody telling him
[55:26] you know look now the shook the stalk
[55:29] and so forth are only carriers of the
[55:32] word they had a part of the word see
[55:35] until they got down justification stif
[55:38] restoration by restoration of gifts in
[55:40] the Pentecostal but now notice just as
[55:43] it was Ish Isaac see and then to Jesus
[55:48] see one was a perverted one was the
[55:50] original and then here comes the seed
[55:52] itself see now the church has come from
[55:56] that same thing right back like a flower
[55:59] or anything else it drinks pulls in and
[56:02] goes of course there goes that thing
[56:05] again but if we were what we thought we
[56:08] were we would have great signs in
[56:12] wonders you are the reason we're
[56:17] not well brother you don't put your own
[56:19] self in there not on that statement I
[56:22] want cuz I'm going to put it back in
[56:23] your lap then I'm going to say as human
[56:25] beings we're all of problems you know
[56:28] what this is what I want you to
[56:31] see have you ever thought about that you
[56:33] and I come from
[56:35] somewhere Baptist Methodist Presbyterian
[56:38] Pentecostal Catholics right we came
[56:41] through some carriers right and you know
[56:44] what they were carriers until the word
[56:46] came to us
[56:49] right they were carriers why I want to
[56:52] reject a
[56:53] carrier
[56:55] you know what
[56:57] then this end time bride now click just
[57:01] a minute and listen this end time bride
[57:05] starts
[57:07] off as a
[57:12] carrier now you tell me we
[57:15] didn't right I'm going to tell you
[57:16] you're
[57:17] wrong well I never was in a denom you
[57:20] was one yourself what does it make any
[57:22] difference we was born that wouldn't we
[57:25] born between Eve and the
[57:28] serpent wouldn't it a denomination that
[57:30] was forign back
[57:34] there and a great man of God like Moses
[57:37] to Smite the rock the second time
[57:39] brother around said set up a
[57:44] denomination you and I started as a
[57:51] denomination and we come out of
[57:53] it and what are we trying to do now the
[57:57] day I left at Baptist Church I went to
[57:59] Gainesville and I told him I said God
[58:03] got me out of the
[58:05] Baptist now I want the Baptist out of
[58:11] me because I
[58:13] knew what we
[58:16] are until the word is birth in you and I
[58:21] that will start as
[58:23] carriers
[58:25] and if we don't progress any further
[58:27] than
[58:28] carriers we're not going right right to
[58:34] where we think we may be going by the
[58:36] ground that's cuz I'll never be little
[58:40] nobody when I said that about most of
[58:42] the people this message would die and go
[58:44] by the grave I said then and I still say
[58:46] it I'm not talking about nobody ain't
[58:48] got the new birth nobody ain't born
[58:50] again I'm just saying they don't want
[58:52] the
[58:53] word
[58:55] for you and I to become the word we
[58:56] start as
[58:58] carriers now Jesus didn't do
[59:01] that amen he was the seed
[59:05] amen why I brought that of the prophets
[59:07] being carriers all those prophets were
[59:10] the same brother randam come out of a
[59:12] Baptist
[59:15] Church he was an ordained minister in
[59:17] the Baptist Church he was an elder I'm
[59:20] quoting him in the Baptist Church
[59:23] right
[59:25] so that's why he would say
[59:28] we need this and we this or that right
[59:33] but look what he
[59:35] says bridegroom
[59:37] tree let's go to the next one what are
[59:39] we on number 16 17 okay they're getting
[59:44] above me all right see not there with a
[59:46] shook look what he says
[59:50] remember there is no more after that
[59:53] shook remember there's no more seed
[59:56] promised to a woman anywhere after
[1:00:01] Mary and there is no more denominations
[1:00:04] promised after Pentecost it's the
[1:00:06] Rapture and the bride coming forth from
[1:00:09] there the seed the word made manifest
[1:00:12] again so it'll have to be done now the
[1:00:14] next one by P 18 that's a repeat uh
[1:00:20] 19 Christ is revealed in his own
[1:00:23] word paragraph 89 so when you watch
[1:00:27] nature and you see wherever age and
[1:00:30] directly designed it out that we're in
[1:00:32] the last age the shuck has pulled
[1:00:37] away
[1:00:39] yeah he didn't say the shuck is going to
[1:00:42] pull away because look he says the shook
[1:00:44] is pulled away now you might think it's
[1:00:48] not important for me as I was trying to
[1:00:50] express Sunday that brother random was a
[1:00:52] part of the body of Christ that's
[1:00:57] right now we're going to get to the
[1:00:59] message where the bride is smitten from
[1:01:01] the
[1:01:07] church she's throw it
[1:01:09] out and he's part of it right but when
[1:01:13] he would say the shook is pulled away it
[1:01:17] certainly wouldn't pulled away from you
[1:01:19] and I
[1:01:20] right that's right but it begin to be
[1:01:23] pulled away from from him right now as
[1:01:27] John one man on patmas could represent
[1:01:32] the bride do you believe that you
[1:01:35] believe that in the Book of Revelation
[1:01:36] re 4:1 when John went up he represented
[1:01:38] the bride right so the prophet could
[1:01:41] represent the entire bride as one person
[1:01:43] I can't do it you can't do it we can't
[1:01:45] do it but he could represent the entire
[1:01:48] bride right come
[1:01:50] on you see nature shu's pulled away
[1:01:53] we've had 15 years nearly 20 now years
[1:01:57] of the message sweeping across from
[1:02:00] Nation to nation and this morning hooked
[1:02:02] up across this nation see and no
[1:02:05] organization it can't organize there has
[1:02:08] nothing ever been like it or we'll be
[1:02:11] herea see the thing that's the matter
[1:02:14] with the message
[1:02:20] today is those who obtain it in their
[1:02:26] heart now are you reading the thing
[1:02:28] that's the matter with the message
[1:02:31] today
[1:02:33] what is those who obtain it in their
[1:02:37] hearts must lay in the presence of the
[1:02:39] son to get Ren see you can pick up the
[1:02:42] message and then let the sun bake all of
[1:02:46] the greenness out of you see making
[1:02:49] mature Christian see what I mean God is
[1:02:52] coming soon to receive his church and we
[1:02:54] must have that type of Christians for
[1:02:57] him to receive the wheat has got to be
[1:03:00] right all right go ahead to the
[1:03:05] next the invisible Union of the bride of
[1:03:07] Christ paragraph 190 and then the life
[1:03:10] comes out of that denomination goes into
[1:03:12] the grain then what happens when the
[1:03:14] grain begins to grain begins to grow and
[1:03:16] to get bigger so it can cover over
[1:03:19] something the denomination pulls away
[1:03:21] from why ain't we got a denomination out
[1:03:23] of this he
[1:03:25] said they will never they will they
[1:03:30] never will be you can't denominate this
[1:03:35] message because if it's back to seed how
[1:03:37] can you denominate a
[1:03:40] seed why ain't we got a denomination out
[1:03:43] of this they never will be it's the
[1:03:45] grain it can't go no further we're at
[1:03:48] the end time so what does it have to do
[1:03:51] now lay in the presence of the sun to be
[1:03:53] R and that's exactly right to be ripened
[1:03:55] into your heart to bring forth and live
[1:03:57] what we're talking about yes sir and
[1:04:00] we've been doing that for 40 something
[1:04:01] years laying in the presence of the son
[1:04:05] amen right now that's to some people to
[1:04:09] some people it's been playing in the
[1:04:10] garbage can of organized religion the
[1:04:13] whole time I come on I I
[1:04:18] don't you think I like to talk like
[1:04:22] that then in my heart I cry to think
[1:04:25] about the way the people of this message
[1:04:28] has been
[1:04:29] done and they're coming down fast on us
[1:04:33] y you're going to find out you're going
[1:04:36] to see who's word and who's not y That's
[1:04:39] Right can't hard to get church now you
[1:04:42] just wait till it com to a
[1:04:46] change
[1:04:48] okay
[1:04:50] see all right going to the next one
[1:04:55] what we got 21 I believe this is Tak on
[1:04:58] God's only provided place of
[1:05:02] worship I believe the church is
[1:05:04] beginning to hear the
[1:05:06] message this was
[1:05:09] 1965 and beginning to understand it oh
[1:05:13] we don't have to understand all we got
[1:05:15] to do is just
[1:05:17] believe he said a true ego will
[1:05:21] understand right but friend listen we
[1:05:25] got to lay in the presence of the son we
[1:05:27] got to be ripened our faith isn't ripe
[1:05:31] intellectually we're hearing the message
[1:05:33] that God has give us and seeing the
[1:05:36] signs that he showed us and proving it
[1:05:38] by the Bible it's there but oh how the
[1:05:41] church needs to lay in his presence till
[1:05:43] it tenders up you know and get sweet in
[1:05:46] spirit so that it can bathe down some
[1:05:49] sometime in speaking the message you get
[1:05:52] harsh have to break it in in like that
[1:05:55] because you got to clinch a nail to make
[1:05:56] it whole but when the church once gets
[1:05:59] it the elected is called out and
[1:06:01] separated then in the presence of God I
[1:06:05] know it'll be something like the people
[1:06:07] was there when it takes the
[1:06:11] Rapture now he's referring back to the
[1:06:13] people beyond the curtain of time if you
[1:06:15] want to tie it
[1:06:17] together so
[1:06:20] remember it's not up to us to manifest
[1:06:22] any other thing except one thing and
[1:06:25] that's to be the
[1:06:28] word Mary the shook has done her
[1:06:34] part it's up to you and I to lay in the
[1:06:36] presence of the sun to
[1:06:40] ripen
[1:06:42] now you know what we used to do mom used
[1:06:45] to and I loved them she made um fried
[1:06:49] apple pies I mean remember them you go
[1:06:52] your jar and you can get you something
[1:06:53] now
[1:06:54] yeah them fried appies were
[1:06:57] wonderful but you know what they had to
[1:07:00] do they cut them apples do them just
[1:07:03] right and you couldn't put them out on
[1:07:05] cloudy days and all kind of things you
[1:07:08] wanted them out in the sun but not to
[1:07:10] burn them down all day you wanted to
[1:07:12] move and do different things and that's
[1:07:14] what we kids had to do but we had to
[1:07:16] turn
[1:07:18] them and roll those
[1:07:21] things until they dried
[1:07:26] right see that's what God's been doing
[1:07:29] through a five-fold
[1:07:32] Ministry 54 Ministry has been taking
[1:07:35] this message and breaking it down to the
[1:07:40] people but most of them has been
[1:07:42] denominating their own little
[1:07:45] ideas that's
[1:07:47] right well brother Dale you're just one
[1:07:49] of them big old
[1:07:51] denominations come let's talk about it
[1:07:56] I'm open for
[1:08:01] discussion but don't bring silly
[1:08:03] ideas well I
[1:08:06] think bring me the prophet's message in
[1:08:08] the Bible we'll talk all
[1:08:14] right what are we on look and even what
[1:08:17] is at today this is the
[1:08:20] rapture uh I may this may be the repeat
[1:08:23] I'm not certain and even what is at
[1:08:26] today don't try to keep it for tomorrow
[1:08:28] burn it with fire before daylight come
[1:08:31] you remember that's what you do with the
[1:08:32] bread see this is the reason you don't
[1:08:34] do it for there's a new message coming
[1:08:37] forth and a new
[1:08:39] thing now look at there oh brother D
[1:08:42] there's a new message
[1:08:49] coming now you show me where it's at
[1:08:56] because I've just proved the point by
[1:08:58] the prophet that there's not another
[1:09:01] move beyond the the the shook except
[1:09:07] becoming the seed and the Prophet come
[1:09:11] to bring the message and he's part of
[1:09:12] the body bringing the message to you and
[1:09:16] I so if it's anything added to that what
[1:09:19] do we get the same thing the Bible says
[1:09:24] not a new
[1:09:29] message it ought to be that every time
[1:09:31] we listen to a take we get something new
[1:09:36] not different but
[1:09:40] new of the word right what is
[1:09:45] it see try to hold it over but that's
[1:09:48] been the attitude of the church a
[1:09:50] Revival Goes Forth and first thing you
[1:09:52] know within about 3 years they start an
[1:09:55] organization over it a denomination
[1:09:56] starts organization but have you noticed
[1:09:58] this has been sweeping the country
[1:10:00] sweeping for 20 years now and there's no
[1:10:03] organization and there never will be
[1:10:06] there never will be this is the end the
[1:10:09] wheat has come back to the wheat again
[1:10:11] the wheat has come back to its grain the
[1:10:15] shook has pulled away from it and the
[1:10:17] wheat must lay in the presence of the
[1:10:18] sun to be
[1:10:22] rened right
[1:10:29] let's go to the next one power of
[1:10:32] transformation paragraph 151 through
[1:10:36] 153 but see when it comes down now we're
[1:10:39] in the last age not back in the
[1:10:41] Pentecostal age there we're over here in
[1:10:44] the last age and the first Age begin
[1:10:46] with the word which was Christ and the
[1:10:48] last age has to end with the word which
[1:10:50] is
[1:10:51] Christ and these other things these
[1:10:54] Shucks and so forth as I have explained
[1:10:58] is just carriers of the word to serve
[1:11:01] its purpose until it comes into the full
[1:11:05] stature see of what the original grain
[1:11:09] was now is that the message we call the
[1:11:12] stature of a perfect
[1:11:15] man is that the one that he's talking
[1:11:21] about back to the original grain
[1:11:26] go to the next
[1:11:28] one this
[1:11:30] is do God ever Chang his mind about his
[1:11:32] word
[1:11:34] 65418 drop down to paragraph
[1:11:38] 43 you read all in between there and see
[1:11:40] it and see what he's talking about but
[1:11:43] you see we believe that we are carriers
[1:11:46] of a great message for this very hour
[1:11:50] that we're living in you want to do do
[1:11:54] that with us brother Anthony says
[1:11:58] amen we are
[1:12:01] carriers so we're going to start off as
[1:12:07] carriers but as I said Jesus never
[1:12:10] started as a carrier and then become a
[1:12:13] seed but the bride has to start as a
[1:12:20] carrier right the great Mary the gave
[1:12:23] birth was a
[1:12:25] carrier wonderful place the bride is
[1:12:29] pregnated to give birth to the word am I
[1:12:32] quoting the
[1:12:35] prophet so if she's pregnated to give
[1:12:37] birth to the word where's it
[1:12:42] at I don't know where this one came up
[1:12:44] or not but paragraph 113 through 115 the
[1:12:47] seed night a shook in Los Angeles
[1:12:52] California and that that's not my words
[1:12:55] it dece the very elect if possible he
[1:12:57] said that's not my words that's what he
[1:12:59] said now after a while maybe you'll get
[1:13:01] an understanding of what I'm trying to
[1:13:03] say now the seed certainly look
[1:13:07] more That Shook looked more like the
[1:13:11] seed until more than the pollen did and
[1:13:16] more than the stalk did but they were
[1:13:18] only carriers of the seed Luther
[1:13:21] organized the stalk Di
[1:13:24] Wesley organized the pollen died
[1:13:26] Pentecost organized the life
[1:13:29] died and now comes forth the
[1:13:32] seed you can't go any
[1:13:35] further than the
[1:13:38] seed can't go no further than the
[1:13:41] seat because you're back to as we'll get
[1:13:44] to it in another message or so down the
[1:13:46] road you come back to the son of man
[1:13:49] right amen the original seed that went
[1:13:51] in the ground that's amen but is a say
[1:13:54] then but everybody's looking they want
[1:13:55] to know where the signs and the Wonders
[1:13:57] are
[1:14:02] at I'm going to just tell you like what
[1:14:05] I
[1:14:06] think I think the greatest sign that
[1:14:09] could ever be is a group of
[1:14:12] people that would be able to stand in
[1:14:15] the hour that we're
[1:14:17] living and fight all these
[1:14:19] denominational spirits and ideas of
[1:14:22] preachers that come through to try to
[1:14:24] plant all their doctrines and ideas and
[1:14:27] that she would simply just stay with the
[1:14:32] word now may I quote brother
[1:14:38] brandom he said that God would try the
[1:14:42] people to see whether they would stay
[1:14:45] with the word or
[1:14:46] not not like I've always said you know
[1:14:49] we talking about manifested sons of God
[1:14:51] you know everybody wants to see manifest
[1:14:53] ested sons of God Well you certainly
[1:14:54] don't need a manifested Son of God to
[1:14:56] call for rain in a msum
[1:14:58] season right you might need for him to
[1:15:02] call it
[1:15:07] stop but brother Dale they sick among us
[1:15:10] I know that and I cry and I pray for you
[1:15:13] every night and I pray and hold you up
[1:15:16] call your
[1:15:16] name
[1:15:21] amen but you see
[1:15:27] we can't do
[1:15:29] anything until he tells
[1:15:32] us that's right amen when Jesus came to
[1:15:38] the end of his
[1:15:40] days now come on bear with me in this
[1:15:43] thing when Jesus came to the
[1:15:48] last few days of his
[1:15:51] life where was there any signs and
[1:15:58] wonders
[1:16:01] right when Paul came to the end of his
[1:16:04] days am I quoting brother
[1:16:08] right he was in jail got his head cut
[1:16:12] off didn't even have a coat for the
[1:16:14] winter
[1:16:17] time but yet he had the power within him
[1:16:21] that he had spoken the word and things
[1:16:23] take
[1:16:25] place I thought we believe the
[1:16:28] Bible when Jesus said I do nothing until
[1:16:31] my father shows
[1:16:36] me I thought that's the way we were
[1:16:38] supposed to
[1:16:43] be over 40 years ago people were talking
[1:16:46] about well I'll be glad when it comes we
[1:16:49] can speak that
[1:16:50] word I said then what I say now
[1:16:53] I said we got to have the word before we
[1:16:55] can speak
[1:16:57] it oh that didn't go over good then it
[1:16:59] don't go over good
[1:17:04] now but see that's not making excuses
[1:17:10] right excuses don't justify nothing
[1:17:16] Amen brother collie years ago preached a
[1:17:19] message about excuses I can still
[1:17:21] remember about height of it you want to
[1:17:23] listen to me for a
[1:17:26] while
[1:17:29] excuses when you're telling the truth
[1:17:31] it's not
[1:17:35] excuses when Jesus could do nothing
[1:17:37] because of the unbelief of the people
[1:17:39] was that an
[1:17:43] excuse when Paul come in his last days
[1:17:46] it looked like the the worst time of his
[1:17:48] life but the prophet said it was a
[1:17:49] crowning time of his
[1:17:52] ministry
[1:17:53] and he's getting ready to get his head
[1:17:54] choed
[1:17:55] off he says that's where that he stated
[1:18:00] that
[1:18:02] phrase right before there was prior to
[1:18:04] cutting his head off death where's your
[1:18:07] sting and Grave where's your
[1:18:13] Victory but you see we look at it we've
[1:18:15] got it all and we've had it in our minds
[1:18:17] to to look at it there it got to be
[1:18:19] signs and
[1:18:21] wonders
[1:18:25] I still believe there are signs and
[1:18:26] wonders taking
[1:18:27] place I still believe the sick is being
[1:18:30] healed that's
[1:18:33] right I don't have to worry about it
[1:18:36] I've seen the dead race I don't have to
[1:18:37] worry about it I've seen the sick healed
[1:18:39] of the word I don't have to worry about
[1:18:42] it yeah but I need it right
[1:18:47] now see now we're trying to tell God
[1:18:50] what to
[1:18:51] do
[1:18:54] what if he never chooses to heal
[1:18:57] you right what if he chooses to leave
[1:19:01] that there is
[1:19:02] a trophy of his
[1:19:05] grace why should we be so sarcastically
[1:19:09] and down and out about
[1:19:11] it and say thank you
[1:19:14] Lord could be a whole lot worse couldn't
[1:19:16] it
[1:19:17] Danny not that
[1:19:20] much just a matter of a few inches
[1:19:25] and he would hit a solid concrete
[1:19:34] situation what about
[1:19:36] it I'd love to see more miracles and
[1:19:39] signs and wonders yes and I strive for
[1:19:42] them and I believe in
[1:19:44] it but I also know the
[1:19:47] Bible and what it
[1:19:51] says if you you're going to try the word
[1:19:54] The Pride by the word then that means
[1:19:57] that you're going to sometimes have to
[1:19:59] back off and let
[1:20:02] them not exist alone because he doesn't
[1:20:05] do that he doesn't leave
[1:20:09] us but he's wanting to find out you know
[1:20:11] what brother R said he wanted to do he
[1:20:13] said he wanted to show to Satan that
[1:20:15] this bride wouldn't fall like
[1:20:17] Eve is that
[1:20:21] right
[1:20:25] but you see it's always come on brother
[1:20:31] musicians it's always the other person's
[1:20:38] fault it's always their
[1:20:40] fault you
[1:20:44] know the old saying is if everybody in
[1:20:47] the world was as perfect as I am it'd be
[1:20:49] a perfect
[1:20:51] world
[1:20:56] well I'm sorry the only Perfection that
[1:21:00] is left in anything is through God's
[1:21:04] word and if God says it now I'm going to
[1:21:06] end with the
[1:21:09] thought when are we going to start
[1:21:11] believing what God
[1:21:13] said he promised to pour out his spirit
[1:21:16] in the last days right now don't prop
[1:21:19] that up as to be in the zeusa street
[1:21:21] that was part of it
[1:21:23] the prophet said there'll come a time
[1:21:25] he'll pour out his
[1:21:27] Spirit on the bride I'm looking forward
[1:21:30] to that amen but like I said the people
[1:21:34] in Egypt the children of Israel down in
[1:21:37] Egypt when Moses come walking down Glory
[1:21:40] here he comes we going to quit throw
[1:21:42] stuff down let's
[1:21:45] go they didn't even believe him that's
[1:21:51] right they didn't believe him they got
[1:21:55] out done seen all the signs and the
[1:21:57] Wonders they got out in the wilderness
[1:21:59] and be claimed to murmur and complain
[1:22:05] right right that been for Moses they all
[1:22:09] been wiped out that's
[1:22:11] right think on these
[1:22:14] things it's not derogatory to talk about
[1:22:16] a people being carriers it's what we are
[1:22:20] right we are carriers
[1:22:24] but someday somebody's going to begin to
[1:22:27] say I and my father are one
[1:22:33] right and why can't we when Jesus in the
[1:22:37] resurrection he said I go to my father
[1:22:39] and I go to your father amen started
[1:22:42] right off talking about how great it
[1:22:46] was see why can't we believe what he
[1:22:48] said and just say Thank you lord it's a
[1:22:51] promise
[1:22:54] and say thank you Lord now you just come
[1:22:56] on the scene and make it manifest that's
[1:22:59] you remember what brother R said that
[1:23:00] time he said if I can't do something he
[1:23:02] said don't let me stand in the
[1:23:04] way he said that's the one
[1:23:07] thing don't let me stand in the way of
[1:23:09] somebody
[1:23:12] else let's stand think on these
[1:23:17] things what a great opportunity it is
[1:23:19] for a group of people in the end time to
[1:23:21] start off like everybody else but God is
[1:23:24] going to move among
[1:23:26] her I said that over 40 years ago why do
[1:23:29] you think I would want to back up now
[1:23:31] after 40 Years of hard fighting and
[1:23:33] screaming and hollering and preaching
[1:23:35] the message you think that I'm down and
[1:23:37] out about it no I got a whole lot
[1:23:44] more everybody knows I turn in front of
[1:23:47] my Bible 1969 in Athens Georgia that I
[1:23:50] preached the Bride of Jesus Christ would
[1:23:51] be the son of man
[1:23:53] I've got pages on top of pages extra now
[1:23:55] of quotes to prove that with besides
[1:23:58] what I had then you think I'm not happy
[1:24:01] you think I'm not
[1:24:05] joyous to begin to
[1:24:08] see say yeah but look how bad it's
