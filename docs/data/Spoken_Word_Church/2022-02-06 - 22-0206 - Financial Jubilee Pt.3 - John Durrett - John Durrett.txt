========================================

amen thank the lord well thank god for another opportunity to share with you all this morning and uh we'll just open up in a word of prayer by his grace precious lord jesus we thank you for another opportunity lord uh stand before your people lord jesus and just to share lord more of your word more about you lord jesus and we just invite you to bless this day bless your children lord jesus we certainly appreciate your lord remember all the needs father remember this entire day lord as we come into your presence lord jesus strengthen us lord god and bless us we commit this day the sunday school teaching lord and the rest of the stand of your hands in jesus christ's name amen praise the lord jesus all right well we will continue with financial jubilee i'm assuming that everybody still needs money making money working saving so we're going to continue i think when we're all debt free and no longer need money then we may not have to worry about financial jubilee anymore until then we'll keep sharing more and more and certainly financial jubilee as i said before you know this this is it's not books and theories this this is a life lived you know after god started showing me this several years ago now you know it has really transformed my life i live it every day my kids know my wife know it trying to be a steward of what god has placed in front of me to manage and money is just a small thing it's just a reflection of many other things around us my kids my family my job anything that god gives you to manage we want to manage that stu as stewards but financially it just gives you something that you can put your hands on anybody from the youngest to the oldest you can put your hands on it and we know jubilee when the trumpet sounds you can go free if you want to go free it's a choice so i'm just challenging this morning that it's up to us how we take this it all sounds good right until you're outside you're at the store shopping you're thinking about a vehicle your kids thinking about this or that it all sounds good until you start applying it so i pray that you can take it with you as you go and remember is not how much you have or how little you have but it's about managing what you have that's what this is about you can have two dollars but you got to make decisions on what to do with that and that's what god is trying to see how faithful you are with that little bit because you want to flip to the next slide and i think the the the critical piece behind it brothers you can go to the next slide the scripture really stands out it says therefore if you have been not been faithful in the unrighteous man and who will commit to your trust the true riches or another way of saying that another version so if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth who will trust you with true riches and i believe for sure no doubt this word been preached that's the true riches that we have here but god in his word is saying something that if you can't be trustworthy in worldly wealth money management who will trust to you these true riches and that's certainly what we're here in the statue of a perfect man those are the true riches of god that he has for us his word to reveal it to us but he's saying i'm not going to give you that because he's the one that's doing the evaluation to determine if you're faithful i'm not he's the one that's looking at that how faithful are you with the little things that you have your money because if you can do that if you can learn to say no if you can hold back and have that self-control and that character in handling money that he's saying yeah i'm confident you can handle more you can handle more those true riches so we talked a little bit about last time many of the problems the symptoms that we went through worried about money stressed out trying to handle it trying to get it trying to save it all the things that we deal with with money but one key thing if you go to the next slide brothers go ahead click next go and click next brothers the question we gotta ask is there a difference so when we look at the world is there a difference with how you approaching money management is it the same like the world i mean or you can you stand with someone in the world and you got the same issues the same problems the same concerns and something's not just right because when we look at christ he didn't have the same concerns he did not he did not walk through life just like the world with money management or anything like that he was totally different he trusted god he knew god would supply he knew where the fish was and god supplied so he didn't walk around with the stress he didn't walk with the i gotta earn it i gotta get it it's driving him everything he's thinking about no he did not so there must be a difference with the way we're handling money in that of the world we know that our morals should be different we should be living different our girls should be different or god should be different but what about your pocketbook what about your wallet is that different that's the question let's go to the next so when i think about money management and what i think about it this scripture really well this quote and the power of decision i'm going to take my time and read through this because it it it it just really was amazing my wife and i was listening to this sermon she was listening to it separately and she came down and told me about this i said oh my god this is such a blessing said moses went forward picked packing a stick and we found out the red sea open caused a mighty wind followed that fire the light of god when man walks in the light then the winds follow jesus said tarry you in the city of jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high and they waited until there came from heaven a sound of a rushing mighty wind they walked in light till the wind began to blow amen just step in the light tonight you outside of christ the winds will come back again like they did was on the day of pentecost just keep walking in the light it'll separate the things that was hindering you from one side to the other notice the children of israel walked across the red sea not only in the mud they were on dry ground walking light that's the trouble with the church today you're so loaded down you can't walk light got too many things on you too much hanging around paul said let us lay aside every weight that we may walk light every weight in the senate does easily beset us that we might run with patience the race that's set before us looking to the author and finisher christ walk in the light light footed amen that's what it's about you know if we can get these things off of us these weights these pulls of this world this this world then we can walk in this light light footed amen have that step to having that bounce in your walk when it comes to this word not burdened down and heavy and dead laden and not sure what to do about this decision and money and especially some of you that are older you got kids you got adult children now you got those coming up to be adult children and they need to know these things as well you know we have to know and be able to tell them and have that strength inside of us that character that we see character more important in their life than just saying yes to them okay and those are some of the things you got to deal with you know hey dad i can you co-sign for me dad please i'm i'm gonna pay it back now my son he's not doing this he knows better [Laughter] but those are things i've dealt with with family members okay and you're like oh my god i'm the only one that can rescue them out of this situation no there's a reason why but if you can look through and say no you need the character that's more important to you son or daughter you have to have the character and i can't hurt you by giving but i can help you i can help you learn how to fish i can set things up for you but you're gonna have to walk through this because i see your character as more important and i don't want you to be heavy in this life's journey you have to be light-footed so god can deal with you and they can get that character and learn how to manage this little thing called money then god can start revealing more to them and he will but we have to have that ourselves we have to know how important it is go to the next so we talked about the problem here's a little bit more on that the answer of course understanding the answer this is crown financial ministry and this is one of the ministries out there that helps people certainly as i was going through it and like i said i lost we lost almost everything that seemed like we had and um you know i started seeking god like lord god you something's wrong that's what i said something's wrong i've been paying my tithes i i thought god was gonna bless me miraculously as i said before i knew i said god gonna bless my business oh my goodness they're gonna be thriving that's how i'm gonna get that new vehicle god gonna bless my business oh man it's gonna be all good no that didn't work out that way god had other plans and this is part of his plan because i wouldn't be here now we didn't lose all that money by his grace i wouldn't be sharing this with you it says most of the symptoms of financial problems that families face in today's society business failures foreclosures bankruptcies out of control debt two job families and divorce can be traced to a central problem of ignoring god's financial principles as recorded in his word god's financial principles and instructions are not complicated or hard to understand they were designed to free his people from financial burdens and not to bind them with unattainable sets of dues and don'ts amen all these problems all these things that we see all can be traced to ignoring god's principles for us look at that foreclosures bankruptcies out of control debt two job families divorce all these things and it's getting harder and harder my brothers and sisters certainly for the younger ones it's harder and harder you see so much and they have so many things out there so many choices my goodness if you're looking for a new vehicle they have about 10 different models of the same vehicle you can get the l version the le the xle the platinum the platinum xle my goodness in a start from the base 30 000 by the time you get through it's like 90 000. my goodness and they have a way to pay for that all you got to do is sign right here that's it you can roll out with it and the world knows that and they're marketing that they're after us the devil has a plan believe me he has a plan he knows if he can get us burdened down he has one foot already on you some of the key principles we talked about just want to keep repeating repeating these god owns all the ten percent and the ninety percent never forget that it's not just the tithes that we're paying it's the ninety percent as well he's just giving that to you to manage that's it what are you going to do with that you got to manage his resources diligently you got to you have to be organized you got to take the time i know that's a hard difficult thing a lot of times people say well you know what i'm i'm not a numbers person i'm not this or that guess what the owner he is a numbers person he is so he knows every penny he knows everything that comes across your path so we have to be organized and you can do that in your own way start writing something down somewhere start thinking about when you're going to spin start thinking about those things and think about it's god he knows but think about it that's what we had to do i had to pause and really reflect and that's when god started opening all this up don't waste your money it's part of your time you know my daughter she bought we bought her some some a jacket and um you know i bought it happy to buy it for you know and a couple days later she came back as well it was about about 30 days later and um alicia brought it in said well she's not going to wear it she doesn't want it like okay there's a 30 days up on this thing look that it was one day late i'm like does she know this is an hour of her dad's time life she can't waste this thing but that's it it's an hour of my life if you don't want it you tell me right away you don't want it but by god's grace we called they took it back so i was happy about that but that's how you got to look at it it's an hour of her dad's life my life whatever i spend if i'm wasting it's my life you're going to work every single day putting in those hours that's your time you're getting in return for that time some money you waste it that's your life what you're spending on so watch that delayed gratification learning to wait that's in everything we have to learn to wait on god reading just a scripture of david as he getting he was getting older many of you probably remember the story and before he had crowned solomon or announced solomon to be king his brother jumped in there his brother said hey dad's old he hadn't said anything about the kingship i'm next in line i believe epsilon and the other brothers were dead he's like you know what i'm i'm in no need for me asking i'm going there's no need to wait and he went and claimed that kingship ahead of time ahead of time and he had his parties he brought everybody he was celebrating having a good time good time but he didn't invite solomon he didn't invite the prophet because he knew something was just not right with them they wait they do things right huh we ain't going to invite them we're going to go forward and they didn't wait of course that gave nathan that prophet that time to get with bashiba and said hey go talk to david let's do this thing right ask david david you did mention you're going to make solomon king is that still good if so we're about ready david says sure crowned him did it right waited and of course you know that cost that brother his life later on and he was clinging to the altar for forgiveness but he didn't know how to wait he didn't know how to wait maybe it started very simple when he got things that he didn't know how to wait for so by the time he came to this very very important decision in his life he thought he could do the same thing so we got to learn to wait wait on god wait on him to supply as i said before you know you look at these vehicle prices and it's like it's scary i mean i'm telling you 80 000 80 90 000 for like regular vehicles i'm like this is crazy but you can pay it off in six years this sign right here so now you think about if you wait you wait but see what we challenge with is like i can't do it i can't save 80 000 that's impossible that's what the world tells you so you can sign right here there's an easy way no god wants you to build that character he's never saying you can't do that or you can't get that or you can't have that but he said it do it god's way but i guarantee you you get 90 000 in your hands you're going to think very differently whether you're going to put all that character building that you've built for three to five years of major sacrificing and everything that you're getting and you're putting aside for this bucket of a new vehicle that you want you think about the character you're gonna get from that oh my god you by the time you get ten thousand like oh lord i can't believe i got ten thousand this is amazing twenty thousand lord wow i've set this aside thirty thousand my goodness this is i can't believe it fifty thousand hold on do i want that vehicle sixty thousand oh god lord have mercy lord jesus uh should i be doing this ninety thousand no i don't think i want that vehicle no you know a 5 000 vehicle looking really nice right now by the grace of god and i still have 75 000 left my goodness that's it and you got something worth so much more character wow that's what god is trying to get to us that character but then you take that and you apply it to his word it's the same thing no different he want to see that we have control we got it we know what we can do but we have to wait on god lord i got this money is it your will father god if it is then lord thank you if not thank you lord jesus because that's the power and the character we're gonna need to handle all that god wants to give us my goodness if we're gonna have power to raise dead saints out of the grave it's going to take some character see we look at things just you know everything is spiritual but what about the natural things what about if you have that power and someone's spouse is coming to you saying raise my husband or raise my daughter for me you got the power oh my god if every oh please please i'm dying without it and we don't know then what we're going to do so god knows what we can handle but if we can do these simple things and he knows already he can trust us by his grace amen go to the next principle five avoid debt like the curse the blessing of the lord and maketh rich and he added no sorrow with it i always think of that you know so when someone comes to you and they've taken out a hefty loan and they're like thank god this is a blessing before you say amen say okay okay because there should be any sorrow with what god is adding to you shouldn't be and many times the things that we get in the world that we think gets us rich there's many many sorrows there's arguments there's divorce everything that we talked about that happens and so you can kind of start understanding what is god in and what is god not in of course we know the and go to the end watch the end the ant is always working gathering preparing being diligent we can do that our lives are constantly changing every single day going to different seasons of our lives and if we can start out on this the young i mean i challenge all the young people wherever you are in your life oh my if you can apply these principles to your life wow you will see the hand of god of course the best investment is giving giving to the kingdom of god your return is waiting at home in heaven and we know the scripture acts 20 35 it says is more blessed to give than to receive and that's something we got to work on that's something we all got something i got to work on where you really feel that blessing you know somebody give you something it's like thank you lord they oh i'm blessed the bible said a little bit reversed it said it's more blessed for you to give than to receive so those are the things that we have to just keep working through contentment contentment has learned i'm going to read first timothy 6. i really really like that this reading first timothy 6 6-11 and the scriptures are just full full of all of god's principles that he's laying out for us amen by the grace of god the right scripture here i believe that's first timothy as my pages get stuck together here okay that's the scripture maybe a second timothy but it's godliness with contentment is great gain amy is it first why am i not saying that okay let me know if someone has that okay okay here we go six six yeah that's right but godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into this world and is certain we can carry nothing out very plain and having food and raiment let us therefore be content there with be content now look at that principle he just said if you got food and clothes that's where you start be content right there you know if we start getting ourselves caught up beyond that that's where the devil is able to set in now he's not saying he never said that we can't have all these other things but he said keep that that contentment to start off with know that you're okay if you got food and you got clothes start right there if you got that then you're fine but they that will be rich fall into temptation and snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition for the love of money is the root of evil of all evil which while some coveted after they have aired from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows but thou o man of god flee these things and follow after righteousness godliness faith love patience meekness fight the good fight lay hold on eternal life oh my you see how he just taken that word and and telling us yes food and clothes you got that there are certain things that you definitely need but be content don't pursue pursue these other things which we already know he says seek ye first the kingdom of god now i'm telling you that is difficult to do it's difficult when you look at all these things and our minds are worried about this you're worried about your kids you're worried about providing you're worried about security you're worried about what you're gonna do when you retire you're worried about all of these things that come to your mind but god is saying be content he already knows what you need now you have to take all of his word as far as being diligent with what you have thinking about what you're spending so it doesn't mean that we'd be content and i'm not going to be diligent i'm going to spend whatever i want because god is going to take care of me no it's being all of his word being a wise steward all of these principles and that will keep us on that right path in second chronicles i want to show you how important it is to stay with the word go to the next slide so this is king solomon and we knew solomon and we know how he asked god when he started out for wisdom and god said i'm gonna give you that i'm gonna give you everything else as well and as we get through solomon's life we see solomon past all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom and all the kings of the earth sought the presence of solomon to hear his wisdom that god had put in his heart and they brought every man his present vessels of silver and vessels of gold and the king made silver in jerusalem as stones and they brought onto solomon horses out of egypt and out of all lands wow so we're seeing solomon as he's growing and power and wealth and godly blessings you know and um it's hard to believe that you know as i look at us in america solomon didn't have all the things that we have believe it or not we got any restaurant any meal any kind of desire that you want if you want some indian food and go get some indian you want chinese and get chinese you want some burgers and get some burgers whatever we want we have all these things right at us and if you're whatever you want you can sign and get credit you can do whatever you want so we have a lot of these things that we can acquire as well but during those times of course he had silver and gold and horses out of egypt now when you look at that nothing jumps out to you right away okay well yeah thank god for blessing let's go to the next scripture prior to that time when the children of israel were coming out this is what god told them in this whole chapter in deuteronomy it's like the section is talking about when you get a king and some instructions for the king he says when thou art come into the land in which the lord thy god giveth thee thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee whom the lord thy god shall choose so there should be somebody that god choose now king but he shall not multiply horses to himself what nor cause the people to return to egypt to the end that he should multiply horses god say king when you come in there don't get a lot of horses don't go down to egypt and get horses and you see solomon doing exactly that collecting these horses from egypt that's why god put that scripture in there he got a lot of horses from egypt you would read that and be like well what what what okay but god had told him in the word don't do that neither shall he multiply wives to himself solomon you don't need a thousand don't do it if you do it your heart will turn away neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold don't do that solomon that's how simple it is but he told he said when you do when you sit upon the throne of the kingdom this is what you should do you should write him a copy of the law in a book out of that which is before the priest of the levites and it shall be with him and he shall read therein all the days of his life obviously solomon didn't do that because he didn't read this section that he may learn to fear the lord his god to keep all the words of the law and these statues to do them that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren that he turn not aside from the commandment to the right hand or to the left to the end that he may prolong his days and his kingdom he and his children in the midst of israel that's what god wanted him to do hold on hold on to that word that's it and you see how simple these principles are in his word that's how easy it was for solomon don't get horses god has already told us this word avoid debt manage diligently all those principles that we talked about those are things in god's word that we can apply and it's many many many more that we can hold on to so take that my brothers and sisters take that word of god this gps as he told solomon hold on to it keep it read it take these things that we're learning from god and apply it to your life god bless you all [Applause]
