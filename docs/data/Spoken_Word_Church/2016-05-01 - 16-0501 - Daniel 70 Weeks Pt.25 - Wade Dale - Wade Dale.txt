========================================

good to have brother Trevor his wife with us today from jeffersonville indiana right correct their mom mom what good to have him with us brother garrison bail everybody was no boat ever since he was a small town and he stays and he gave me a revelation this is going on in it he gave me a revelation this morning I told him I said that's brother ride and that's brought that sister Gabby they were at the alabama camp they met at the camp and he said i don't remember him i said he said i would looking for God's I was looking for a girl I said so you went to Alabama I to sit down I was swimming headed kind of line in any bed camp just look for a girl you hear nothing what brother wasn't the only Ashley he was one of the are not truthful ones I've ever heard side and look at the results yeah I say that did he find you over there no se broader one year you brought him down here okay all right so obviously that year I was coming you was right wasn't I'm with you okay yeah she was the one who wasn't there yeah oh boy I gotta laugh but good to have them with him yeah he was better gonna be a mama okay anyway so didn't have everybody in with us today and we're doing a study on Daniel 70 weeks this is part number 25 so we have been we have been looking at the dates and the times all right now we know one thing's for sure that the day of 70 weeks according to Daniel 9 24 to 27 is Jewish so what we are doing is we're looking at it through a Jewish perspective because it's not too loo it's not to the Gentile you got you a little chart that we've drawn all kind of charge and we have the one you brother Brown drew it's a tabernacle but we are now I'm sorry about the driver that we're doing this in you coming in at number 25 but and it may be some questions but that's okay so this is the last week we believe in this church that there's one week left after the Raptor according to the Bible and accordingly problems message we proved it hey me right in we cleaned it okay so not not three and a half years left after the rapture Liz one week left according to the prophets message and according to the bottle more importantly according to the Bible I brother ground said face final resting places in the Word of God he can't say anything outside the Word of God raised already know word prophet but they didn't work probably believe that so now we're on the last week after the Raptors took place here's the sample church age church age is over we took a raptor and now we've come into this last week our last seven years and we show showed last Sunday how we got to that because it will remember going back to the very beginning and in the Dinah 70 weeks book we showed according even to history according to Nehemiah the damn 70 weeks began in 445 bc there was an edit or a contract given to kneel my to finish everything there was an edit given to Ezra he didn't finish it there was an edit given through Darius and Cyrus they in finish it but when certain exert sees gave the commandment or the edict to Nehemiah Nehemiah win finish the walls in 52 days towards about you reading the amounts with two they have trial in one hand and sorting the other man all right according to near life they finished in 52 days in 4 45 be seen so that was our mark as far as when the 70 weeks begin right now if you find out what something begins you ought to be able to find out when something ends if it's got the exact times all right this guy in the exact time they get what they get 400 years for redemption of Israel 70 a week's seventy times seven is how much thank you we've been through this all before five hundred and ninety years and we showed through the prophets messaging through the Bible that 483 of those years have already been completed at the cross and after sixty two weeks of my side will be cut off we've got that okay everybody's got that one we have a little cross right there right here you should have on your chart for 45 bc that's the beginning of the seventy weeks of Daniel all right then there was a according to the Prophet going to the Bible there's three periods a 49-year 434 year and seven year that adds up for our night all right all right that's dummy simple additions because it says seventy weeks are determined so there's only going to be a certain amount of time for shoes for the round said don't worry about the Gentile we have no time revelations 10 6 or 5 at the angle touch the ground he raised his hands of heaven and he said calm should be no longer a man they say my angel in Daniel stood one foot on land on one foot on C raises hand said it'd be great time times and the dividing of time what's time what's it do what's times what's a dividing of time grant I have here all right so you got that so they get a specific time and brother Brown said watch the Jews there the timepiece and we already been through that so we can put time in here right we're just reviewing from weeks of study now we've come to where we've got a marker of 445 bc and then we know that brother branham according to the quotes we were in last Sunday Jesus rode into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday April the second 8030 right okay now you'll see we'll look he's just like right here now not saying a Prophet's wrong but that looks fit he was thinking that Jesus was 33 years old that's what I'm saying because 1833 doesn't fit 8030 exactly fits the 483 years right he said well then he changing the seal no we went back to the steelbook remember last time they will head back to the sixth seal and brother Ronald said Matthew 24 was preached in the afternoon of April the fourth 8033 was killed all right so then I got that so we have another marker we have 4 45 bc we have a t30 right right that's what we were doing last Sunday we were putting these dates in the markers these are markers of time okay now then we have a ton of the Gentiles we went through that last Sunday all right and then we're going to look at another time here because somebody had joined us to go over it again we're going to Gore it again this girl mark here is still in the Gentile time but brother around talked about here 1977 okay all right he made eight he made a statement about 1977 we're going to read it here in a minute and we'll go over it again that's how we're going to rehearse it just one more time because if we can tell when 70 weeks begins when we can tell when the 70 weeks ends all you guys do is back it up seven years you said what are you seven days do you say what you want to brother Brown said you could know the year and the week but nobody knows to bear the album all right so maybe we can get pretty close all right that's what he said to dance and weeks but he's trying to find out Daniel was trying to find out how long it was for they were going to go out of Israel he said we're trying to find out how long it is for us to get out here right because ninety seven weeks is truly to the Jews but have a spiritual meaning problem because it's the redemption of Israel if the six fold purpose redeemed Israel right now I'm 24 it took six purposes finish the transgression in the sand reconciliation for iniquity bring everlasting righteousness still at the vision and prophecy or North the most holy there six thing that's going to redeem Israel and the city because it's 2-2 things now see we don't have a continuance city right we don't have a city and then turn it on we have a city right so we're not looking for a city but the Jews are looking for a city temple worship all the things all right that's what they're used to that's their that's their deal so that's what that like Ron Brown says here in the day I'm staying 2 weeks book he said Ezekiel 42 44 was the building of the millennium temple so there will be on millennium temple because Jesus has the son of David is going to sit on the throne judging the twelve tribes of Israel in the Millennium because remember the Millennium to us is just a honeymoon but it's a jubilee year for the Jews right if the Jubilee from the Jews according to 12 prophet said all right and according to the Bible so what we did is that we took 4 45 bc 8030 1977 now we're going to read maybe not this sunny but next sunday we're going to read all the times that we're brother on said there's one week left after the rapture right he never changed that he never changed that you just didn't understand what he was talking about same way where 1977 brother trevor if he says something about 1977 and the rapture getting clipped a place in 1977 either he was wrong are we misunderstood what he said because profits are very misunderstood right but now the real profit is never misunderstood you don't know if I'm at all and then you know bad versus good i'm at the holy ghost is the prophet of every eight it's the Prophet just a holy dove you all right because watch now look that's where we're at right now if we were prob about nineteen seventy-seven because something did happen in 1977 God made a promise but watch let's get right hand they rejected Christ that was an 830 he turned to the Gentiles and taking people for his name now counting the time we find the way of exactly 17 years left we will have the same span of time given to us as God dealing with us in the power of the holy spirit since 8030 until nineteen seventy-seven because it doesn't fit put 33 of them the same span of time 1954 years God deals with us the same as he did with the Jews because remember the property guy told us things six seals finishes our Redemption Sabbath this Christ come on the same but six seals finishes the redemption of us all right what he said I believe that they can go through the sealed and you can show the redemption of man us Gentiles through those six there those six seals also through the six full purpose town funny constrained that they six seals finishes our redemption in 64 purpose finishes Israel for them show right it's not funny it's exactly what God put in there because remember guys got a mark and we've arrived on that mark okay now he said no watch seinfeld time nothing on vid for years now marked down your book he must have thought it was important mark down your book a little scripture here i want to give you know better kiss 25 beginning with the a verb now we went back a little bit at this 25 08 last Sunday and he'll read it right here as we go on nothing now remember he's already made a statement of 1977 everybody got that run all right now we understand from the first you believe first jubilee of Leviticus 25 8 now if you'll go a little bit at this 25 8 it says you how old the Sabbath every seven Sabbath you have a jubilee we're readin amenities he's got down there where you read it it's right on down here a little bit but we're reading a minute but no watch we understand from the first Jubilee of Leviticus 25 8 in 1977 will be the 70th Jubilee what is seventy times seven Wow after 25 times we go to buy rock 490 got it yeah red lip hear something so anyway so from the first you believe that God give the Jews to the 70th Jubilee there's no 71st or you got 500 anyway put your over at 49 more years that you can you only have 70 weeks determine you only have four ninety years determined you only got 70 jubilate now from the first Jubilee of Leviticus 25 a in 1977 will be the 70th Cuba late 70s you believe I got that right making exactly 3000th 130 years Jubilee means to going up the release and any same that we're watching for the coming of glam metal glam they did you get that car guess and says a man well god is dealt with us exactly the same amount of time he dealt with the Jews from the time together has a promise to the rejection of them aside a t30 was 1954 years now we have 17 years left we had about nineteen hundred and thirty something years we got 17 years left of 77 will be the 70th Jubilee okay 1977 will be the 70th Jubilee since the beginning of Jubilees and what will it be okay guy watch close now don't miss it it will be the Jubilee of the going up of the Gentile bride I see that's where everybody thought I hey I almost caught I wish I was 17 years old in 1977 we in the message this church was founded in nineteen seventy one so a lot of the old ones thought 77 was going to be the rapture 99% of them but that 99% about fifty percent of that man i'm presenting don't believe the message no more cuz in 77 they send all their books back to jeffersonville in quick the message come let's have another round was wrong we never said it was the rapture he said was to going up with the Gentile Church yeah what is it going up it was all that old Pentecostal idea of going to land all coming us coming into the real age that brother branham preached which is the son ma'am ministry going on to perfection going up the statute perfect man it's not the neil I ok did you you say well what you want them but he lied if he said derive from 77 it didn't happen he didn't but we know what happened got 17 years left of 77 will be 270 of Jubilee since the beginning of Jubilees what would be old brother watch close don't miss it because you believe is going up Gentile bride and the return of Christ to the Jews but now watch what he said he continued when they go out of bondage now they will not go out of bond there under bondage right now right all right they can't get the Holy Ghost 144,000 cogito else while we're still here they're still under money but when we go up God comes back to deal with the bright the Gentile I'm in the sorry the Jewish 144,000 they go out of bondage when those two prophets preached at 1260 days are their Redemption than alright you explaining the other way don't you see from all the world and get it there for that day on I see we're at we don't know what time that might happen we're at the end time now he talks about the old-timers and in 1933 he dedicated the church and all that he predict remember he did prophesied he was predicting talks about all the four or five six things woman's nation come up the paper 1933 in 1977 and then breaking to the seals you see what all that comes from I tell you what let's do let's go ahead and read us to the planet let's read it it's in here somewhere but I'm bet on before that so let's go the bed is 25 8 we'll just do that run their last a little bit of his 25 8 and we're reading he said now according to Leviticus 25 8 though he's headed he is that corny Leviticus 25 10 the biggest 25 10 is the 50th jubilee but Leviticus 25 8 is showing what the 49s right okay Leviticus 25 verse 8 and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years into the seven times seven years for seven times seven don't know if not for 97 look we're inside working thank you 7 times 7 is 49 because the Bible tells you right here it adds it up for you and the space of the seven sabbaths of your Shelby until age 40 and nine years 49 years 77 because remember we're still in a 77 we're still in the 49 we are we have got our 50th jubilee right but they're still in there waiting for their time the Millennium all right all right okay oh that's right our family is all I got that's why that the Pentecost is main penta is 5550 that's when the Holy Ghost fell from the Gentiles but he had fell on them yet that felony Jews yet or the vermin I say the Jews done imported for talent but he got any specific Holy Ghost can't fall on you that's right you can't accept the message of the hour but i'll go up to 144,000 that's in the Bible alright so now you shall number seven styles now this is the Crypt r you went to but now watch if he would have went to Leviticus 25 10 you shall hallowed the fiftieth year now that 50th year is the Jubilee year right now as we saw before watch this we've already been good before but just just 77 649 right all right that's the church ages okay that's still in the church a full seven 7 945 but now remember your 50th year was not 123456 Emmett 1949-50 remember it's the first year of the next forty nine years on there is no 50th year your 50th year is the first year of the next forty nine right now we know that according to the Jews they take you to tell you that okay so it's not that we have 49 50 and then one right it's 49 they kept up with it remember they get on the housetop they see the next did see the Sun coming up well that was the first year of the next forty nine years side plate wasn't a 50 year okay so now if I got that no no we all we've been through that a lot itself alright so now according a little bit at this 25-8 brother Brandon goes to the business 25 8 7 times 7 is 49 alright so now but the few days it is that I want you to understand is that if we can find the beginning we ought to be able to find the ending right until nineteen seventy-seven was a marker year something happened prophet said it several several times okay but it wasn't the rapture was it going up it was there was a marker there and what I contend is its windows it's when God quit linking it to ignorance of the Pentecostal people and began a jubilee for the Gentile bride that's what I say because before 1977 everybody looked a 1977 if I look to brother Brown coming back everybody look to this and look to that but after 77 they must have known something was there was two things easily brother hammers rider he was wrong and the one that thought knew he was right knew that they had to dig deeper to find out what he said running the ones that didn't care did hair start with let me just be honest with you mean it's not this everything I'm talking them well it meant something so if he goes to Leviticus 25 8 which is 49 years because remember you can't have a 71st Jubilee the next giveaway started after that 49th year the next year would have been would be a 71st Jubilee right 1977 was the 70th Jubilee so God's give us 49 years to get it right now but because remember 1977 he puts it in the Danish him doing theory for a reason recently it give Atlanta 7 7 is 49 not 50 49 got it all right 49 so add forty nine to nineteen seventy-seven and you got the Year 2026 now you so well what's going on here well let me just give me two things number one brother Dale in 1974 preached his same thing in 1974 he proved we could go to 20 26 and not break what brother Ron said well there was I thought he was an idiot honestly they did till they said no 77 is it well are we still here we still here we're still here this is 2016 that's only 10 years from that year right there yeah but you got to remember that ends the seventy weeks of Daniel we're not we're not here when that in if you got one week left you got to back it up seven years cuz we go on the rapture seven years before nine seventy weeks in right so then it's like I said before I was online looking online at some of the other commentaries because i was reading this morning where brother branham looked at Glamis larkin you're on smith several others and he thanked them and i believe he did I believe brother Brennan was a studied man he didn't just and don't get me wrong he got d revelation from God and man he got the revelation from God but that angel would come down and tell him what scriptures to look for when I brother branham wedding just grabbed his Bible and go ride and start preaching he studied he said I studying all day went from Scripture the spectrum I didn't hurt that angles feelings me and you would probably hurt our feelings we come in and say William random I'm a problem to angel from God you need to go preach this no you can't do that that angel could not give william branham a revelation right that angel wasn't his holy go right all right William Brown had a holy ghost inside of it was Jesus Christ and when you brought it when that angel brought him the word the word took it in till the word that William Brown head inside of him and then he went compared it to the scripture because he he couldn't compare it that's like I said many times before look at Paul and Peter and some of them didn't have a Bible to go by they have a quote book and go by sure Paul had the Old Testament but it was the old custom he had to bring it to the New Testament so by the Holy go to filter logos he brought the Old Testament and brought it into the New Testament and said you'll be judged by my gospel and nobody will be judged by way around us right I believe will be judged by one brother Brown said the man this whole world would be judged by what we friend said so excuse me but that's what I contend is that but when I started looking and it was my whole pretense I was looking online at lunar cycles and because brother Brennan always brings a 30 day cycle in and remember we went through this this was back about number four where we showed that this is the Jewish calendar but you guys study this by Jewish you got to have a Jewish mentality but forever to really understand that instead into eight because it's not to us literally but spiritually it is to it but this is their calendar and it starts in the spring God told them their first month was missing all right start your year here on the fourteenth day of nisin what I'm asking the phone on a fourteenth day of nisin is the Passover on the fifteenth day is unleavened bread on seventeenth days first fruit 50 days later spent off oh my god that this is a Jewish this is the Jewish lunar calendar now the civil calendar starts over here for them so don't get confused their civil calendar starts in our October but their religious calendar starts when Gothel start the first month of your year go back to Genesis I believe the woman was Noah came out of the ark or even notice when Moses was leaving in two pieces you hallowed this month right this month is the first year for you first month of the year for you which is missing hey nobody got there then we know one thing's for sure Jesus fulfilled the first four feast while he was here on her now remember they were having these feast days and he would show up at everyone else it was the word he had to show I am the bread of life he was there one 911 when they were doing the unleavened bread and he said I am the bread of life why they kicked him out of church but remember he was the Passover lamb so he fulfilled this when he was killed we weren't been through this so I'm going we're gonna go through it again so I said this is important the Passover is on this and 14 ok our 14 days after the first now remember this all go by it goes by with moons if you'll read your little thing down here at the bottom if the new moon is not visible on this last day of eight are 29 they added another month the reason they added another month bro trevor was it kept these feast days kept coming around to the summertime that's like our leap year you to have elite you got to back it up so they backed it up by having another 30 day period to a year so some of their here's had 13 months ok so now so he fulfil Passover he was killed and Passover remember they had to get him off the cross because the next day was a Sabbath they wasn't going to leave him up there so they that was Passover unleavened bread was when he was in in the earth firstfruits of land resurrected right and then 50 days later he came back on the day of Pentecost in the bleeders so he fulfilled all for these feast but he hasn't fulfilled leave to the Jews right right but he's fulfilled all these four hours we've got all these speeds days I mean we are brother bramson we're feasting under the Feast of Tabernacles right here right God Tabernacle in human flesh that's what he wanted to do with Israel but they turned him down all right so we got Feast of Trumpets Day of Atonement Feast of Tabernacles and at least the dedication which is hanukkah yet to fulfill so now I was looking at this day kept coming up on the internet and I wondered one and there were several people doing studies of the same thing listen these people that I'm sorry there's people in a denominational world that's got more revelation about dating 70 weeks than ninety percent of people miss messaging we had masters meeting several years ago and one preacher like to knock this ceiling down his righteous indignation gotta just put it that way but he was dead wrong right there he's wrong I don't care safely wrong Brown program said I wish the day that we stand up and say you know Samuel foster so I told him they would say my brother grunting all right I really don't care meet you though now I don't lose no sleep over that I really don't write cuz truth is truth then when you know true they've set you free I mean you don't worry about this thing okay anyways I don't have to worry about it anymore even more now than them than than before but the Year 2026 kept coming up so this guy did a study he went back to NASA and took all the moon stop was from way back so snacks that goes by that NASA don't go by are 365 in the 4th calendar Dave they have to get them stars lined up the moon lined up and everything to shoot a rocket so they go by the moon all the moon phases and all those things so this guy brought the lunar table down and now remember if we got one week left after the rapture that's 20 520 lunar days everybody got that this is where we didn't cover this much last Sunday 2520 days is 1216 remember in Daniel 9 27 the prince will make a covenant for one week and he shall make a covenant not Jesus the Antichrist will make a covenant with many for one week and in the midst of that week he'll because that he will come in and say the sacrifice is going to be finished alright so now so if you got 1260 days and 1260 days that makes 2520 days okay right now this guy's and it was really good we brought it in because he showed that 2014 2016 and 2019 is the only 33 years that if you add seven years to it it comes with that day I mean after that date but you had seven years to finish the stem and you finish the one the 2520 day cycle he called the so it's kind of strange that you got you put these two together you got seven years not this one that's this year that one we know it didn't happen but there's only one year left that fits the 2520 lunar cycles to make exactly seven years to the end of the 70 weeks and a okay then it's just something that you own a little while if you bring it back to that wind when the Antichrist walks into this temple right here and he desecrates the temple right at the Bible Daniel 9 27 he shall bring that coming in the middle of the week when he breaks that covenant he has desecrated the temple but what is he doing he's going to walk into the temple and say I am I am the man I'm the one that you're supposed to be worshiping not this bulls and goats in this Messiah you say is coming and all this they see he's now going full 144,000 they're going to be separate it's going to be the old of the Orthodox Jew that hasn't received holy ghost of these two prophets are going to prophesize 1260 days take out 144,000 and they're going to leave all right they're gone the Antichrist is dealing with the ones that are still building temples and putting sacrifices up and having all these offerings well now when do you do when do you make your one made your offering for the year that's over there's only one time of year that made that they could take that one lamb and make that one sacrifice and that covers them remember we look that's like a little bit but Passover if he comes in and Passover which is missing then you ought to be able to back it up 1260 days and that's where you got October of 2019 so that's the hardest time that is when the Feast of Trumpets occurred because remember the day of atonement there's not a morning for killing anything it's the morning that something has already been killed anyway we're going through that they haven't told us not a day that you make a sacrifice all right so now if you'll go to Zechariah Zechariah says to preach the prophet comes and they say where did you get those scars he says in the house of my friend through those two prophets they and then remember the Bible says that the man goes away from the wife and they mourn for so many days because they what some morning that they realized right here they realized they killed them aside two thousand and some odd years ago that's what the two prophets are going to preach to right they're gonna preach you killed him already well you are you looking for him for you've already killed him he's already brought a Gentile bride he's coming to get you and they're gonna mourn the Day of Atonement there's a mourning for the kill not that something's killed alright so we okay with those that right now you can position okay i'm not saying today listen I've told you 29 thing comes and leaves i'm still be standing around here i missed it somewhere i missed it but i think one thing for sure if we go to 20 if it goes through 20 27 that's the 71st you believe they can't be assembly first jubilee that's right if you go 50 years past 1977 you went into a 71st you believe you can't do that I mean there's no sending first you believe the 70 of Jubilee is going to continue on for the Jews did you believe for the Jews that's what they're looking for they're looking for time if you read Ezekiel where everything is going to come back together they're going to build a temple and they're going to have all this the tribal orders going to be back in and there's going to be peace for a thousand years it's not to us even the millenniums not to the bride we're barely human we're very as observes we're they're just having a vacation right cuz we don't have to build a temple and we don't have to do this we're done hey we gotta clarify how you're right mm-hmm will you need beside the glorified body total guy so far I'm just showing you that how perfect they will watch what the property God said we might kind of understand what are you talking about let's read one thing before we go I think I got any more ain't that a pretty girl asked my friend a that's my grandbaby rat very beautiful blue chenille assessment how I can say let's just make sure we see because because it may have been a little bit of cocoa on a t30 could watch 70 weeks a day all right here I Jesus Messiah rota the city of Jerusalem triumph on the back of a white mule on Palm Sunday now what is Palm sunny the the Sunday before the resurrection okay April the second 8030 users from Jerusalem Palm Sunday 8030 now we find from bc 4 45 280 30 is exactly 475 years but remember you had converted it into the 30 year calendar that's what he's going to do and then watch what we did on the sixth seal they say well run around meant a t-33 well I don't think something now this is the sixth seal brother Brian was talking about 90 24 24 and when was it preached now let's stop here these three verses they took place actually on Tuesday afternoon April of four sandy is April a sec that 90 was the third Tuesday was the fourth 8030 Jesus was crucified that friday that makes friday that same thought that week on friday and the first two verses took place in afternoon April fourth in a t30 all right no hello questions and answers 1963 after the sales and freight return from these people we know that Jesus was slain about 80 30 all right but we pretty much put that down he was he was killed in a t30 we proved he was born in for PC because that's when Herod gave the thing and Herod died right before the end of the end of the beast thing so he's born for me saying he died 8030 is 33 years old right it was about the middle of the year 1830 so so that mark on your count on your thing where the cross is that's a t30 not 33 nobody goes my toe brother brown say that and you know eat my flesh and drink my blood that wasn't explained very well but all explained in it communion that's what we're gonna have this afternoon session sunday will probable
