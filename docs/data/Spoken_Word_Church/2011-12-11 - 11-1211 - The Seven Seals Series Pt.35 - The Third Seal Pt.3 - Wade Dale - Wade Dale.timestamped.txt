[1:41] okay
[1:43] right
[1:45] all right chapter six verse five and
[1:49] when he had opened the third seal
[1:51] I heard the third Beast say come and see
[1:53] and I'll be held in a little black horse
[1:54] and he that set on him had a pair of
[1:56] balances in his hands and I Heard a
[1:58] Voice in the midst of the four beef say
[1:59] a measure of wheat for a penny three
[2:02] matches of barley for a penny and see
[2:04] thou hurt not
[2:05] the oil
[2:07] and the wine all right let's go over to
[2:10] Matthew
[2:12] before
[2:13] and read that part that Jesus was
[2:16] speaking to the disciples
[2:20] about
[2:22] the third seal
[2:24] which will be Saint Matthew chapter 24.
[2:31] verse
[2:33] seven
[2:38] because watch
[2:40] now remember we're looking at a
[2:41] progression of God but we're also
[2:43] looking at progression of the devil
[2:44] remember he goes from just being a
[2:46] saying to a deed to a Doctrine to a
[2:49] full-blown hope all right all right or
[2:51] someone that they can Crown look at the
[2:54] number verse 5. now watch this in the
[2:57] natural sense for many shall come in my
[2:59] name saying I am Christ and shall
[3:01] deceive many
[3:02] verse 6. well that was the first seal
[3:05] verse 5 verse six
[3:07] is the second seal and you shall hear
[3:11] well it's not here
[3:13] of wars here of wars
[3:17] and rumors of wars
[3:19] see that there'll be not trouble for all
[3:21] these things must come to pass but the
[3:22] end is not going to come now look at
[3:24] verse 7 is the third seal for a nation
[3:26] shall rise against Nation
[3:28] they're going to battle it's not just
[3:30] rumor Wars
[3:33] it was happening
[3:35] it wasn't just a rumor it wasn't just a
[3:36] saying or a deed it became a Doctrine
[3:39] somebody said I'm declaring war on this
[3:40] person here we're going to battle all
[3:42] right right you see that you see the
[3:45] progression
[3:46] see look for a nation shall rise against
[3:48] Nation see out here in Kingdom
[3:52] Satan against Kingdom gods
[3:55] all right Kingdom of Satan is going to
[3:57] be fighting against the kingdom of God
[3:58] and that shall be famines now what does
[4:00] say not to do hurt not the oil in the
[4:02] wine
[4:04] all right
[4:05] and pestilence and earthquakes in
[4:07] diverse places
[4:09] all these things are the beginning
[4:11] of Sorrows see now look you go to the
[4:14] fourth seal which we're not doing now
[4:16] but look at verse 9. then shall deliver
[4:17] you up it's not Nations fighting against
[4:19] Nations
[4:21] watch it narrow down more and more now
[4:23] they're coming after you not just the
[4:25] United States fighting Russia
[4:29] or Satan's kingdom and God's kingdom
[4:31] it's come down to where Satan's kingdom
[4:33] is fighting you
[4:35] and they shall deliver you up
[4:38] to be afflicted and kill you it's not
[4:40] just Nations not just the same it's not
[4:43] just see that shall say I am Christ
[4:46] verse five say it
[4:48] mouth
[4:51] verse 6 here
[4:54] verse 7 is going to happen
[4:57] same way with justification
[4:59] justification you say you're a Christian
[5:01] you start trying to act right then you
[5:03] come up and you shall hear what what's
[5:05] the first thing you got to do in
[5:06] sanctification you got to hear the word
[5:07] of God because that's what sanctifies
[5:08] you right right you got to not just say
[5:10] I'm a Christian you got to start what
[5:15] you're in the word all right hearing the
[5:18] word
[5:18] all right in verse seven then you got a
[5:21] war remember Black Dog white dog
[5:23] there's no war before that you're just a
[5:26] devil
[5:28] now you got God come in and clean the
[5:29] shovel up but the devil's still playing
[5:31] with your body and your spirit so you
[5:33] got a war
[5:34] it's not a rumor anymore
[5:38] it's a battle
[5:40] because remember this third seal times
[5:42] what the baptism of the Holy Ghost we
[5:44] ain't got to do it yet but if what it
[5:46] does this this justification
[5:48] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[5:50] third seal death with this old guy
[5:52] someone's got to die
[5:54] because you can't be newborn if you're
[5:57] the old person
[6:03] see he knew the natural part yeah
[6:07] but Jesus said you can't you can't
[6:09] understand that that's not natural
[6:11] happening that's a Heavenly happening
[6:13] right that's Supernatural not natural
[6:16] the natural happening he was looking at
[6:18] he could see Nicodemus in the product of
[6:20] the natural Act
[6:21] but he said Nicodemus in other words you
[6:23] got to be born again
[6:25] and that doesn't say b-r-n-e-d
[6:29] it says born again
[6:31] we get into that later he said you must
[6:33] be born again
[6:36] what Jesus said born from where
[6:39] above a new birth all right same thing
[6:42] well here's the nations are going to
[6:43] rise against Nation when did you start
[6:45] having all your real battles
[6:49] when you became a Christian that's right
[6:52] right that's right Nation shall rise
[6:55] against nation and Kingdom against
[6:56] Kingdom if you'll read through all these
[6:58] and we're going to go all the way down
[6:59] through it you'll see what we were
[7:01] talking about even in Abraham's life
[7:03] last Sunday
[7:05] with Abraham's Life coming down typing
[7:07] justification saying everything has to
[7:09] type those three
[7:10] there's no way you can get around
[7:14] there's no way you can get around
[7:17] foreign
[7:17] these times
[7:20] there's no way you've got to go through
[7:22] justification you've got to go through
[7:23] sanctification you've got to go through
[7:25] the baptism of the Holy Ghost to be born
[7:27] again
[7:29] not born from your mama but born again
[7:31] born from above all right a new birth
[7:34] all right
[7:35] so let's go never get away from that
[7:36] let's don't ever get away from the New
[7:38] Birth let's don't ever get away from
[7:39] being justified let's don't ever go get
[7:41] away from being Sanctified I want you to
[7:43] keep that in your mind because even when
[7:45] brother Brown gets to the uh
[7:47] future home he types this world going
[7:49] through the same thing
[7:51] and anytime then he tells you you're
[7:54] going to go through the same thing water
[7:56] and Noah's day blood when Jesus dripped
[7:58] on the Earth and the Earth remember goes
[8:01] after us
[8:02] we get our fiery baptism here for those
[8:05] of us that are born again we've had a
[8:06] fiery baptism already had that burnout
[8:09] but the natural world is going to get a
[8:11] fiery baptism the Holy Fire God is going
[8:14] to burn this thing up in the Battle of
[8:15] God in Magog when all the spirits are
[8:18] killed and we come back to rule the rain
[8:21] now the one the Millennium is not
[8:23] that's not the fire of God
[8:26] remember it's not the fire of God that's
[8:28] man's fire that's Atomic waste that's
[8:31] atomic explosion the man is going to
[8:33] destroy this world but after the
[8:35] Millennium God's going to come back and
[8:36] Satan's going to rise up and and God's
[8:39] going to kill him with not nuclear fire
[8:43] of nuclear fire you still have no it's
[8:46] going to be wiped off
[8:47] clean
[8:49] then he's going to come down with the
[8:51] city
[8:53] and guess who's going to be in the city
[8:55] you and I all right so everybody
[8:56] understand that's where we're up to
[8:59] as far as the third seal natural
[9:01] happenings spiritual happening all right
[9:05] pair of balances
[9:07] wheat and barley what did it say right
[9:09] here there shall be famines now you say
[9:11] well that's natural yes but that's also
[9:13] a spiritual family
[9:15] what did the Catholic church do they
[9:17] took all the wheat and barley away from
[9:19] the people and said we got it
[9:20] we'll give you what we want to give you
[9:24] same wave of famines and pestilence and
[9:26] earthquakes in in many places and all
[9:28] these at the beginning
[9:30] of Sorrows all right so now let's get
[9:32] our seal book out let's read what the
[9:33] problem said
[9:36] on page
[9:38] 234 if you have the regular book but
[9:41] it's paragraph
[9:43] 250
[9:46] in the third seal paragraph 250.
[9:51] third seal all right
[9:57] everybody got it
[9:59] paragraph 250. third seal
[10:03] that's where we're going to start today
[10:05] we're going to properly explain
[10:08] try to get the basis of what we're
[10:10] looking at
[10:13] all right everybody got it
[10:17] huh
[10:20] this book right here paragraph 250 of
[10:24] the third seal don't go look at 250 in
[10:26] the first seal now the breach or the
[10:32] it says the third sale
[10:37] yeah
[10:42] if we wait on you baby
[10:45] all right you need a book yeah uh
[10:48] somebody got a bookmark
[10:51] okay okay all right everybody guys say
[10:54] Amen
[10:56] okay we're there I got a few 50. now if
[11:00] you get Spanish reading the scripture
[11:02] all right now a lamb has got the book in
[11:04] his hand breaking the seal he's broke
[11:07] the first one second one and now he
[11:08] breaks the third one and as he breaks it
[11:11] the lamb breaks it the third seal the
[11:12] third Beast now how many knows what the
[11:15] third Beast look like look like a man
[11:17] remember lion ox man and Eagle all right
[11:19] the first one looked like a lion the
[11:21] other one looked like a calf or an ox
[11:23] and the third one looked like a man
[11:25] as a man and he heard the living
[11:27] creature of the Beast living creature
[11:29] like a man say to John come see what it
[11:31] is this mystery that's been hit all down
[11:34] through the years of redemption since
[11:36] the foundation of the world has been hit
[11:37] under this seal what's going to happen
[11:40] now come look what it is so he opens it
[11:42] up a thunder blast and the lamb opens
[11:45] the seal
[11:47] see there so it's not that the Thunders
[11:48] are sounded on the first field the
[11:50] Thunder sounded every sealed you see you
[11:51] read that right there let's read it
[11:53] again
[11:54] so he opens it up a thunder blast and
[11:57] the lamb opens the Seals All right what
[12:00] did he see he seen a black horse
[12:02] paragraph 253.
[12:05] and his rider had a balance or scale in
[12:07] his hand now that's the first thing he
[12:09] saw when the lamb announced it broke the
[12:10] seal then the other BC then beasts are
[12:13] taking turns about announcing come see
[12:15] and John where he was standing may be
[12:17] like this he walks over here when the
[12:19] lamb opened and walked over usually the
[12:22] Thunder strikes as we've seen the first
[12:24] seal
[12:25] he watches to see what takes place and
[12:27] he sees a man coming first on a white
[12:29] horse
[12:30] he watches him ride down on down through
[12:32] John sees him Plumb to the end but you
[12:35] know Donnie and I were talking about
[12:36] yesterday that horse that horse didn't
[12:38] go away that horse is still riding
[12:41] that's why you can't talk to most people
[12:43] in the world they've got a white
[12:45] righteous attitude
[12:47] I got it
[12:48] and most people on the message the same
[12:50] way I got it you can't tell me nothing
[12:52] else all right
[12:54] once you get that you know what horse
[12:55] you're riding on
[12:57] all right
[12:58] and he sees a man coming first on a
[13:00] white horse who watches him ride down
[13:02] and on down through John sees him
[13:03] plunged to the end he sees him come down
[13:06] his White Horse got a bow in his hand
[13:07] the rider has has no Arrows with it the
[13:10] next thing he sees he gets the crown
[13:11] rides right on through and we find out
[13:14] the lamb Here Comes again he opens
[13:16] another one and look here comes the red
[13:18] horse this man has a sword in his hand
[13:20] he rides on down through the scripture
[13:22] see see he rides on down through the
[13:24] scripture
[13:25] this is a religious demon he's not
[13:27] riding through
[13:31] readers died yet Penthouse Magazine
[13:34] Cliff he's not running through that he's
[13:36] a religious devil
[13:37] he's riding through the scriptures
[13:40] because he's given his own
[13:41] interpretation of the scripture you see
[13:44] that
[13:46] actually I didn't have that underlined I
[13:48] just see that so I I just saw that okay
[13:50] so
[13:51] all right
[13:53] you gotta listen to what brother Brown
[13:54] says he he don't just fill up space with
[13:56] words
[13:58] all right he rides right on down through
[14:00] the scriptures see with this sword in
[14:02] his hand and was to kill and take peace
[14:05] from the earth now the lamb opens
[14:07] another seat another one of the living
[14:09] creatures like a man says come and see
[14:11] now he walks up he saw my John he walks
[14:14] up to see what it is when he does there
[14:16] comes a rider on a black horse now last
[14:18] night we found out that the same Rider
[14:20] that rode the White Horse with the same
[14:21] one on the red one and the boy said in
[14:24] the midst of the beast called out you
[14:26] see
[14:27] there come to see what it was he was in
[14:30] this living
[14:31] in this living creatures and he saw this
[14:33] Black Horse let's stop right here for a
[14:35] second I want everybody to understand
[14:36] one thing those four creatures lionox
[14:39] man and Eagle do you know what that is
[14:43] bottom line that's the Holy Ghost
[14:46] right that's the Holy Ghost bottom line
[14:48] you can call it whatever you want to
[14:49] call it as far as intelligence and
[14:51] sacrificial locks and and Eagle be able
[14:55] to but it's the Holy Ghost
[14:57] bottom line those four living creatures
[14:59] because when we get to the fifth seal
[15:01] brother Brown says the raster takes
[15:03] place on the force seal and he types it
[15:05] and shows he said see those creatures
[15:08] are not on the earth anymore
[15:11] so what happened
[15:13] now the four seal didn't say a thing
[15:14] about the Rapture taking place
[15:16] but in between the lines we read the
[15:19] love letter that brother Brown was
[15:20] telling us that Jesus wrote to us that
[15:23] hey once those creatures are have
[15:25] disappeared
[15:27] the bride has to disappear because that
[15:29] line oxman and Eagle was given to the
[15:31] bride to protect us go over into Ezekiel
[15:36] they stand faced all four corners
[15:39] whatever you need that's what they're
[15:41] there for to do they're they're symbols
[15:43] to of the Holy Ghost in The Believer
[15:47] combating
[15:51] that living creature is not just not
[15:53] doing anything he's moving read Ezekiel
[15:55] he's moving all the time moving forward
[15:59] and it's like I think Ryan had a
[16:01] question about that one time remember a
[16:03] couple years ago or something you
[16:04] wondered how the there was four
[16:06] creatures but they all were walking
[16:07] forward
[16:09] well you have to just look at it more
[16:11] like a
[16:13] like a movie scene
[16:16] you know lionox man and Eagle it's kind
[16:18] of like a hologram you know what a
[16:19] hologram is hologram is you see
[16:21] something here but you can move over a
[16:22] little bit and there's something hid
[16:24] behind that a different image if you
[16:27] need the line if you need the oxman and
[16:28] Eagle they're always going forward
[16:31] but you may not need them all at one
[16:33] time and we're not Catholics to call on
[16:35] the line call them no we've talked to
[16:37] the Holy Spirit but in our brains we're
[16:40] supposed to realize
[16:42] in our in our intelligence that God give
[16:44] us not intelligence about the
[16:45] intelligence God give us we're supposed
[16:47] to see that that line is bold we're
[16:49] supposed to be a bold Christian
[16:51] but sometimes we have to be sacrificial
[16:53] in the work that we do
[16:55] we have to be intelligent as man is
[16:57] intelligent you've got to hear the word
[16:59] first all right and you got to be in
[17:01] Talent the intelligence of God always
[17:03] defeats Satan always
[17:06] and then the eagle is
[17:09] we can see further than anybody in any
[17:11] age
[17:12] but you don't go praying uh to a lion
[17:15] image or an ox or a man or an eagle get
[17:17] that that's Catholicism get that junk
[17:19] out of your head
[17:20] but we do realize that
[17:23] they're there for our protection
[17:26] the lion oxman and Eagle just like the
[17:29] just like in the uh when the
[17:33] when they camp
[17:38] it's with the ark
[17:45] line ox man and Eagle each one of those
[17:47] had like the line of the tribal Judah
[17:49] Judah was right here with his Bantam
[17:51] with his other two you had there's 12 12
[17:54] tribes right three six nine twelve
[17:56] twelve trials and that's the same thing
[17:58] in Ezekiel
[17:59] Ezekiel said there was man lion ox man
[18:02] and eagle and each one of these banners
[18:04] tribe of Judah so he had Judah over here
[18:06] he was kind of the head but he had two
[18:08] others that was with him on this side
[18:10] the Ops was Reuben or somebody I think
[18:12] it was on this side
[18:14] didn't the man and then the eagle
[18:16] but what was it protecting what is this
[18:18] right here
[18:19] this was the holy of holy
[18:22] which is what type of what the Holy
[18:24] Ghost the New Birth the believer
[18:28] there's no way
[18:31] if an enemy come from this way
[18:34] they didn't just have to fight Judah but
[18:36] they kept enough people around here in
[18:38] case in case the devil made a put a
[18:41] back door slip on you you get my you get
[18:44] my drift you understand what I'm saying
[18:45] in life
[18:47] there's something there to protect your
[18:49] backside
[18:51] there's something here to protect here
[18:52] if they attack from this way this way
[18:54] this way or this way
[18:56] now these didn't you know in a natural
[18:58] battle you would who in the world would
[19:01] take all if it attacks from here who in
[19:03] the world would take all these
[19:05] and run them all over here well if I was
[19:07] a good enemy that's the first thing I'd
[19:08] do
[19:10] I'd make a sneak attack around on the
[19:12] backside I'm just saying natural but
[19:13] that's what God's doing for us
[19:16] protecting the holy of holy brother
[19:18] Brown said Matthew Mark Luke and John
[19:21] protected the what book of Acts
[19:24] which is the actual the Holy Ghost and
[19:25] the believer so he got the book of Acts
[19:27] you got Matthew Mark Luke and John which
[19:29] was the Lamb's protection
[19:31] right here was the most important thing
[19:33] to Israel
[19:34] nobody got into that all right until
[19:37] they sinned in the natural type they had
[19:40] the sin to give us a chance all right
[19:42] but they backslid and let them take the
[19:45] holy of holies and tear it apart and do
[19:46] all that stuff you know in a spiritual
[19:48] that can't ever happen
[19:51] once you get the Holy Ghost what the
[19:52] Holy Ghost is in that holy of holies in
[19:54] in the in the inside Satan can't come in
[19:57] there and get it that's right but he
[19:59] sure can find a battle
[20:01] all four ways so the lion oxman and
[20:04] Eagle was given now when brother Brown
[20:06] saw them gone in the fifth seal
[20:09] he goes back and the Holy Spirit says
[20:13] they're gone
[20:15] brother Brown probably asked a question
[20:17] they're gone where are they
[20:19] he said they went up with the bride
[20:22] so the bride takes a Rapture after the
[20:24] four seal which is justification
[20:26] sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost
[20:27] and the word made flesh
[20:30] that's your four
[20:32] remember it was Palm warm canker worm
[20:34] caterpillar Locus four ate it down four
[20:38] has to bring it back all right there's
[20:40] only three just in case they came back
[20:42] in the Holy Ghost but you got to have
[20:43] that word incarnate This Is Us in the
[20:46] end time line ox man and what eagle
[20:50] see further see higher man intelligence
[20:53] that's good
[20:54] but that eagle can see a lot further the
[20:56] word incarnate is what we're looking for
[20:58] in the end time everybody understand
[21:00] that I'm kind of stuck on that but let's
[21:02] stay stuck on it for just a minute make
[21:04] sure that we know that this we're not
[21:06] just talking about a symbol of a line
[21:07] symbol of an oxman no that's the Holy
[21:09] Ghost
[21:11] in your life teaching you and training
[21:14] you like I said before get all the
[21:16] images out of your mind that you got
[21:17] well unless I'm going to be gold bold I
[21:19] got to pray to the line no that's
[21:21] Catholicism
[21:22] it's the Holy Ghost it's the
[21:24] characteristics of the Holy Ghost one
[21:26] day I'm going to preach on the
[21:27] characteristics of the Holy Ghost and
[21:28] it'll be real good because I've already
[21:30] got some thoughts on it actually this
[21:31] morning I got a few thoughts on it
[21:35] but the Holy Ghost has a characteristic
[21:37] because it's a person
[21:38] Holy Ghost is not just a spirit right
[21:41] it's a person
[21:43] brother Graham said the person of Jesus
[21:45] Christ come to you to baptismal Holy
[21:46] Ghost who is that that's the Holy Ghost
[21:48] it's a person it's not just a spirit
[21:50] that moves somewhere it's God
[21:54] you can fly right into the sun right
[21:56] sure
[22:00] and I'm telling you it's it's just a you
[22:03] know and I made a statement last Sunday
[22:05] I think and and out in Kansas and I
[22:07] wasn't doing it to be boastful but but
[22:10] the lion couldn't take us
[22:12] another word Luther's message
[22:15] it was bold Oh my he protested that
[22:18] Catholic Church
[22:19] he was bold he spoke bold that first
[22:21] three ages spoke Bowl
[22:24] ox
[22:25] Luther and Wesley they have they were
[22:28] just they they just got enough to get in
[22:30] the body and and become a Christian
[22:33] but there's more requirements As you
[22:35] move higher right right more
[22:37] requirements
[22:39] line
[22:41] ox
[22:43] man Eagle you're going high you're
[22:46] you're stack the stature even of the
[22:48] animals are higher
[22:51] but the line you won't miss you don't
[22:53] want to mess with a line he might be
[22:55] just this tall all right you don't want
[22:57] to mess with him though he's bold but he
[22:59] can't see very far
[23:02] right he has to get up on the hill to
[23:05] see down in the grass
[23:07] the auction's a little bit higher he can
[23:09] see the line coming
[23:11] the man's got the intelligence
[23:14] to be able to see and understand
[23:16] everything that goes on around him but
[23:17] you know what if there's a mountain
[23:18] right over there
[23:20] I can't see past the mountain I can see
[23:22] further but I can't see past the
[23:24] mountain but the eagle he gets up so
[23:26] high until he just every time he flies
[23:28] he just keeps seeing more sky more of
[23:31] the curvature of the earth more than he
[23:32] doesn't there's there's as long as he
[23:34] keeps flying even over the Rocky
[23:36] Mountain doesn't matter if he's in the
[23:37] Alps he flies right over the top of that
[23:39] and that's what we're in the end time
[23:41] that's what we are not making us
[23:44] anything but God made us his way God
[23:46] made us to what we could see where
[23:47] Luther couldn't preach this message
[23:49] Luther couldn't teach the seals Luther
[23:51] couldn't teach the sanctification like
[23:53] we know sanctification Wesley could
[23:55] teach sanctification but not like
[23:57] sanctification we did because see he
[23:59] went lean more to the Natural part where
[24:00] T didn't have any uh natural
[24:03] ingredients in it that would help you so
[24:05] quit drinking it you know quit this and
[24:07] quit that but see in your journey you
[24:09] got to do that you got to start quit
[24:11] doing this and quit doing that in
[24:13] sanctification all right so here we are
[24:16] in the stage of the of the baptism of
[24:18] the Holy Ghost
[24:19] we see a pair of balances we see wheat
[24:22] and barley we see oil and wine which is
[24:24] which is what the Holy Ghost and
[24:26] stimulation of Revelation all right
[24:27] which is the Holy Ghost but it's also a
[24:30] black horse which is the worst death you
[24:32] can have is being denominationally dead
[24:35] the Bible says
[24:37] the woman is dead while she lives with
[24:39] one's top of the what church
[24:42] so she's dead while she's alive
[24:44] she goes to a dead church but they're
[24:47] the most alive people like I said last
[24:49] Sunday they're all worshiping there it's
[24:51] just everything's worshiped now let's
[24:52] just worship worship
[24:54] and wear our plants and cut her hair and
[24:56] you know believe in Eternal health and
[24:59] you know but
[25:00] you can't do that and be a real True
[25:03] Believer all right so let's read let's
[25:05] keep reading just for a second
[25:09] everybody okay with that I mean you see
[25:11] you see what we're talking about as far
[25:12] as the Holy Ghost it's the lineup it's
[25:14] all those characteristics of the Holy
[25:16] Ghost that's what the Linus man and
[25:18] Eagle is go to Ezekiel and read Ezekiel
[25:20] and you'll see how they fly
[25:23] they're always moving
[25:25] they're not stopped they're moving if
[25:27] you need help this is what comes to help
[25:29] you and this is what comes to help you
[25:30] it's not some saints see that's where
[25:32] the Roman Catholic Church gets all that
[25:33] they don't just pull things out of the
[25:35] sky because what did I tell you
[25:37] that Rider rides through the scripture
[25:39] so those Roman Catholics took the
[25:42] Ezekiel and said hey there's a symbol of
[25:45] a line symbol of an ox symbol of a Man
[25:47] symbol of an eagle
[25:49] and they Twisted Satan twisted around
[25:51] said okay let's pray to our store let's
[25:53] pray to Zeus let's pray too and then
[25:56] they have that all mythology that they
[25:58] brought in
[25:59] and then what Satan do he put it right
[26:01] in Scripture
[26:03] he put it right in the word
[26:04] because see he was there when the word
[26:06] was being written remember Satan was
[26:08] there watching it so he's he's a better
[26:10] reader than we are he just can't get the
[26:13] revelation of it he's what a copycat so
[26:15] these are copies
[26:18] what
[26:19] red black and pale are all a copy
[26:24] of the lion oxman and Eagle this is the
[26:27] opposition
[26:28] that horse is in opposition you read
[26:30] brother Brown many times in the seal but
[26:32] he says in opposition so that's what he
[26:34] does he opposes right the Bible says he
[26:36] opposes and exaltes himself above God
[26:39] all right
[26:41] you said Satan put it in the word that
[26:44] sound might sound funny to somebody well
[26:46] Satan took it out of the word
[26:48] and misplaced it
[26:51] sorry thank you misrepresented
[26:53] he never put anything in the word
[26:55] because you can't add two
[26:56] but what he'd done was he added his
[26:58] interpretation
[27:00] okay thank you
[27:03] that's my sweetheart thank you I don't
[27:05] mind that listen I I'm going my mind's
[27:08] going 90 miles an hour so actually we
[27:11] weren't going this way this morning but
[27:13] we're heading this way now
[27:15] we weren't going toward the lion oxman
[27:17] in Eagle because I wanted to get to this
[27:18] listen
[27:19] uh
[27:21] 258 and the boy said in the midst of the
[27:23] beast called out you see there come to
[27:25] see what it was he was in this living
[27:27] creature he saw a black horse
[27:30] let's read the scripture and when the
[27:32] voice in the midst of the four beats
[27:33] called out a measure of wheat for a
[27:35] penny and three measures of barley for a
[27:36] penny but see thou not hurt the oil
[27:39] and wine see this Rider let's discuss
[27:42] him if you'll notice the first Rider who
[27:44] he was and we found out last night
[27:46] script Charlie that the second writer
[27:48] was exactly the same man only was on
[27:51] another horse
[27:53] what happened he changed his ministry
[27:57] see the Holy Ghost don't change his
[27:59] ministry he just goes in the symbol of a
[28:01] lion oxman and Eagle but he don't change
[28:02] anything God's unchangeable that's
[28:05] Satan's problem he has to change he
[28:08] adapts because remember he goes after
[28:11] if you're the original you never have to
[28:13] change
[28:15] it's people that takes a copy off of you
[28:17] they have to change certain things or
[28:18] they'd be the original that's right all
[28:20] right same way in anything if you close
[28:23] and and all these things you know you
[28:25] there's some little something off or or
[28:27] City's brand name things they just want
[28:29] some little something off why because
[28:31] it's a copy of if it was not a copy of
[28:34] it'd be the original
[28:35] so he's a copy of all right there's some
[28:38] little something wrong what he misplaces
[28:40] the word
[28:41] and the writer less disgusting if you'll
[28:43] notice the first seal who he was found
[28:45] out last night script believe that the
[28:46] second rider was exactly the same man
[28:48] only it was on another horse what
[28:50] happened he changed his ministry see
[28:52] right we found out he was an antichrist
[28:54] and he had changed his position we find
[28:57] out that when he first just was a white
[28:58] horse he became a Doctrine now we've
[29:01] taken every one of these right down to
[29:02] the scripture see now watch here we're
[29:04] at tonight the other churches now see
[29:06] we're coming down to the third churches
[29:09] now just exactly on the third Church
[29:10] stages exactly like the third horse
[29:13] now the first church age what was it
[29:15] Nicholas in the doctrine
[29:17] this this kind of paraphrase I need
[29:19] let's get over here because he's running
[29:20] out of town let's go to paragraph you
[29:22] see what he's doing he's counting it
[29:23] down Through the Ages 263.
[29:25] which is on page 236 all right
[29:31] and just as that church is that kind
[29:33] Antichrist Church progresses so has the
[29:36] Bride come along with different things
[29:38] now watch him he's placing
[29:41] justification sanctification and the
[29:43] baptism of Holy Ghost and moving right
[29:45] on
[29:46] it's not with the Holy Ghost and moving
[29:49] right on
[29:51] so so there's something beyond the Holy
[29:53] Ghost you say oh listen to what I'm
[29:55] saying
[29:56] give the Holy Ghost and really you just
[29:58] get started so there is a lot Beyond
[30:00] okay we don't go beyond the Holy Ghost
[30:03] the Holy Ghost takes us beyond the baby
[30:06] birth of being born again takes us into
[30:08] these stages that's why there's another
[30:10] form of justification just like we
[30:12] preached before there's another form of
[30:13] sanctification
[30:15] it's not a different I didn't say a
[30:17] different when I said another form of it
[30:18] all right
[30:21] higher order each time
[30:23] and moving right on see just like that
[30:25] only they taking their Revival first and
[30:28] the church is taking it the last their
[30:30] first three years first three stages of
[30:32] them that went through the Dark Ages
[30:34] then the third three stages comes comes
[30:37] the church out from justification
[30:38] sanctification baptism holy ghost in
[30:41] incarnate God made manifest Among Us
[30:44] here he comes in as the Antichrist as a
[30:47] false prophet then the Beast then the
[30:49] dark agent
[30:50] then in the Dark Age I'm sorry and the
[30:52] church comes out of that Dark Age
[30:54] justification of sanctification baptism
[30:56] of the Holy Ghost Incarnate Word the way
[30:59] now
[31:00] see there that's four stages
[31:03] got it
[31:05] justification sanctification baptism the
[31:07] Holy Ghost Incarnate Word that's the
[31:10] fourth stage the word's got to be
[31:11] incarnate sure it was incarnate in those
[31:13] people but not but it was in a baby form
[31:15] it was in a partial form all right
[31:18] now he goes down uh-huh you see that he
[31:21] goes down the church goes up just as
[31:23] perfect as it can be oh it's beautiful I
[31:25] just love it this writer is the same one
[31:27] but another stage of his ministry
[31:30] the first stage the White Horse scene he
[31:33] was just a teacher just an antichrist
[31:35] teacher he was against the word of God
[31:37] and how now how can you be an antichrist
[31:40] anybody that denies that every word of
[31:42] this isn't true
[31:45] and to be taught just the same as an
[31:47] antichrist because they deny the the
[31:49] word and he is the word now let's skip
[31:51] over
[31:53] to 273
[31:57] same Rider now everybody okay you got it
[32:00] same router now this first stage he was
[32:02] innocent second now if you went a little
[32:04] bit higher a little more than that the
[32:07] second stage the Bible said he was given
[32:08] a crown and they crowned a man a
[32:10] Superman so he crowned him and then the
[32:12] Bible didn't call him a pope the Bible
[32:14] called him
[32:15] a false prophet
[32:18] look at verse two look at 245. now the
[32:21] next thing we find out that the devil
[32:23] controls all politics that ever has been
[32:33] and the next thing we find out that the
[32:35] devil controls all politics that ever
[32:39] has been
[32:40] are ever will be
[32:44] ever has been
[32:45] or ever will be excluding none all right
[32:50] but he's trying to get to church
[32:53] so he goes down to deceive it and he
[32:55] gets his Superman
[32:57] Works him into an organization and
[32:59] crowns him Banker of Christ Christ acted
[33:03] instead of God see this guy is a biker
[33:05] instead of God just the same instead of
[33:08] God what he's supposed to be a biker
[33:10] under Christ all right now
[33:19] go to 280
[33:22] one we're going to read this just for a
[33:24] second and then it will be done right
[33:25] here
[33:29] now as great power comes he was made
[33:31] biker of heaven and worshiped as God
[33:33] ruler of the Earth by uniting the church
[33:36] and state Together made him ruler on
[33:38] Earth gave him a crown over that
[33:40] he could pray this old out of purgatory
[33:42] he could also Enter he was just like God
[33:45] on Earth instead of God together he had
[33:47] great power to kill whomever did not
[33:49] agree with his command
[33:51] what was that that was the second seal
[33:53] he's really talking about a second seal
[33:54] if you look in paragraph 279 he's
[33:55] talking about the second seal but listen
[33:57] to this but he's going to say who is
[33:59] going to say anything to him now look
[34:01] that Spirit never died
[34:06] brother Brandon said he got into people
[34:08] the people died but the spirit moved on
[34:10] all right and today
[34:13] who is going to say anything to him the
[34:15] church can't say nothing he's head of it
[34:17] State can't say nothing he's head of it
[34:19] so they died by the millions all them
[34:21] little churches brother was busted up
[34:23] killed and murdered and fed the lines
[34:25] and everything else see the dragon Rome
[34:28] give him his seed and Authority the
[34:30] Bible said so see so he rode his tight
[34:33] red horse through human blood till it
[34:36] became
[34:37] a red horse now see that's number two
[34:41] now let's go one more let's go on over
[34:44] 294.
[34:47] you'll have to flip over a couple of
[34:49] pages 294. I'm just kind of trying to
[34:51] set a base here just for about a few
[34:53] minutes
[34:54] now here is the mystery of this and now
[34:57] it when it revealed to me earlier this
[34:59] morning next on my third seal for
[35:01] daylight then I went quickly the
[35:03] description began to look search it up
[35:04] there it was three of them so far has
[35:07] been absolutely supernaturally revealed
[35:09] yeah now here's the mystery of the black
[35:10] horse corn to what's been revealed to me
[35:13] he started writing in the time of the
[35:15] Dark Ages that's what the Dark Horse
[35:17] represent the dark ages for it was a
[35:18] time of midnight to the True Believer
[35:20] that was left all right now look going
[35:22] down to
[35:23] 298. now we're going to get back to this
[35:28] I'm gonna give you the symbols as he
[35:29] gave them
[35:32] his balance is already scaled in his
[35:34] hand everybody on 298 calling out
[35:36] measure of wheat for opinion three
[35:37] measures of barley for a penny see
[35:39] actually that is sweet and barley is
[35:41] natural staff of life
[35:43] that's what bread and stuff is made from
[35:45] but you see he was charging for this
[35:46] what it means that he was charging his
[35:49] subject for the kind of Hope of life
[35:51] that he was sending out to them by
[35:53] making he started in that very time of
[35:56] making them pay for prayers charging for
[35:58] prayers they still do it no Venus
[36:01] because what was he doing capturing the
[36:03] wealth of the world a scale weighing out
[36:06] measure of wheat for a penny three
[36:07] measures of barley for a penny now you
[36:09] see that's still going on today that's
[36:10] my point you see that
[36:12] so let's don't let's don't look at these
[36:14] seals and that was my point really to
[36:15] come to right there because we're going
[36:18] down if you'll read it
[36:19] to uh 305 now oil symbolizes the Holy
[36:23] Spirit and then he talks about uh the
[36:25] wine the stimulation of Revelation okay
[36:31] paragraph 308 really good when the truth
[36:34] of a promised word of God has been truly
[36:36] revealed to his Saints that's filled
[36:38] with the oil they all get stimulated
[36:40] wine is a stimulation
[36:42] boring
[36:44] all right
[36:46] but watch that thing's not dead I want
[36:50] you to realize that that thing's not
[36:51] dead
[36:52] I don't want you to separate these seals
[36:55] that that wild horse rider we said well
[36:56] he wrote off into eternity and everybody
[36:58] just kind of forgets him no
[37:01] how are you gonna forget the
[37:02] justification you went through if you're
[37:05] not gonna forget that sanctification
[37:07] same thing you're not going to forget
[37:08] that
[37:09] okay so let's not forget that these
[37:11] spirits that are that we're working we
[37:14] say in the coming out of the of the
[37:17] fourth age into the fifth age Lutheran
[37:19] Wesley
[37:20] the tech thing's still working today
[37:22] that's what we have to come back and the
[37:25] only way we can combat it is with the
[37:27] Holy Ghost you can't combat it any other
[37:28] way because any other way you're going
[37:30] to be trapped into it
[37:32] without the Holy Ghost you're going to
[37:34] be trapped into this
[37:36] all right
[37:37] so without the Holy Ghost read what
[37:39] happened
[37:41] and you'll see that's what happened
[37:42] that's what's happening to the people
[37:44] what's happening now is there's nothing
[37:46] for us to fall back on there's not other
[37:48] another age to shovel this off to this
[37:51] is it
[37:52] so as we get closer to that four seal
[37:54] we're fixing to take a rapture
[37:57] you know we got five six and seven to go
[37:58] but we're going to take a raptor in it
[38:00] for sale and type
[38:02] so as I showed you how it moved up
[38:04] closer to a nation should Rise Against
[38:06] nation and then for sale they're going
[38:08] to come to kill you
[38:10] you're gonna come after us personally
[38:13] all right so keep that in your mind and
[38:16] in your heart that the devil's not stop
[38:20] when you see the wild horse rider going
[38:22] off and he starts over on the black
[38:23] court and now you keep it in your mind
[38:25] this right here
[38:27] Satan's always going to come around
[38:29] brother Brown said he's got one shot
[38:31] left at you right and it's at your weak
[38:33] point so you keep that point covered all
[38:35] right same way with here
[38:37] in battle you always cover your weak
[38:39] spots in anything Sports whatever you're
[38:42] Hunting Fishing whatever you cover your
[38:44] weak points why because you know that's
[38:46] where you can be attacked as quick as
[38:48] that all right all right let's go
[38:56] thank you
