[3:46] evening I'm going to read two places in
[3:48] the
[3:49] scripture one is Isaiah the 61st chapter
[3:54] and Ephesian the thir chapter but Isaiah
[3:57] the 61st chapter of
[4:00] is and I want to begin reading this a
[4:04] lot better for me to look right here and
[4:05] this on this little letter I
[4:07] got and I like this better I hate to say
[4:10] this it say The Spirit of the Lord is
[4:13] upon me because the Lord has anointed me
[4:17] to preach good Tiding right unto the
[4:21] meat he has sent me to bind up the
[4:24] Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the
[4:27] captive and the opening of Prisons to
[4:31] them that are bound to proclaim the
[4:34] acceptable year of the Lord Y
[4:38] and I think he stopped right there and
[4:41] he didn't go that part he just stopped
[4:43] right in there somewhere in other words
[4:45] because it was not the day of Revenge is
[4:47] was not that was not his message he only
[4:50] went to the part that was concerning
[4:52] himself and he stopped why you that why
[4:54] St Luke when Jesus stopped everybody was
[4:56] standing there what's going on why
[4:58] didn't read the rest of it because he
[5:00] only read the part that was concerning
[5:01] his ministry okay uh Ephesians

[5:12] 3D
[5:13] chapter me yeah Ephesians the 3r chapter

[6:13] Jesus spoke it in uh Isaiah spoke it
[6:16] here he said the spirit of the Lord is
[6:19] upon me because the Lord has anointed me
[6:22] to preach the good uh to preach good
[6:25] Tiding unto the meat and to and
[6:30] and good time unto me and to have sent
[6:33] me to bind up the Brokenhearted to
[6:36] Proclaim Liberty to the captain and the
[6:39] opening of the prison to them that are
[6:42] bound my title is you are in somebody
[6:46] prison house right you are in somebody
[6:49] prison house and uh uh you know today we
[6:53] are in somebody prison house if you
[6:55] don't want to believe it or not right it
[6:57] a but two sources in the world
[6:59] is either God prison or you going to be
[7:02] a prison for the in the devil prison
[7:04] house so I begin to look at this thing
[7:06] here as I begin to think on anything
[7:08] here what is a prison what is a prisoner
[7:11] a prisoner is a it means a a
[7:15] person a prison is a
[7:17] building a cell for locking up peoples
[7:22] convicted of a crime right it says a p
[7:25] to have a prison you got to have a
[7:28] prisoner right yeah what good would be a
[7:30] prison it was not a prisoner so a
[7:33] prisoner is a person who is held caped
[7:38] by someone or something right yeah then
[7:42] Paul did a definition it was a
[7:43] definition a prisoner of love and then
[7:46] it goes on here and says here and to be
[7:48] a prisoner you have to have a conviction
[7:52] somebody had to bring you up convict you
[7:53] of a crime and it said to convict to
[7:56] judge and found guilty
[8:00] in a in a court of law the jury convict
[8:04] him for a
[8:06] robbery a person who is sentenc to serve
[8:10] a person who who is serving a sentence
[8:13] in prison this is the natural ter right
[8:16] prison so now I want to look here and we
[8:19] begin to here a prison is been bound by
[8:22] someone or something hallu it don't mean
[8:26] that you are are prison somebody that's
[8:29] held by captive even by a power of some
[8:33] source and you can't get free of it it
[8:36] could be a drug you can be a prisoner
[8:37] the drug you can be a prisoner to sex
[8:39] you can be a prisoner all the things if
[8:41] you can't get free from it you in prison
[8:43] but I'm going to use this right here the
[8:45] prophet said in the in the in the
[8:47] message uh in the old seal book he he
[8:50] talking about here in the Old
[8:52] Testament he said in know and he talk
[8:55] about speaking of the Jubilee He said
[8:57] but if you do not he said but but if he
[8:59] do not want to go if he do not want to
[9:02] go he is satisfied with his slave master
[9:05] then he is taken into the into the
[9:07] temple and they would they and
[9:11] they want would would take an all you
[9:16] know what all is and and they would
[9:19] pierce his ear and put a hole in his ear
[9:22] and it is a Mark that he can never go
[9:26] back right is that right he has so that
[9:30] he he has to serve his master for all
[9:33] the time I do not care how many times
[9:36] the Jubilee sounds that's right or
[9:39] whatever happen he has absolutely sold
[9:42] his Birthright he he has sold his birth
[9:45] rate out of for being free right when
[9:52] Satan when a man turn down the gospel
[9:56] right Satan marks him yeah what in there
[10:00] he deed him so he can never hear the
[10:02] truth no more he is finished he stayed
[10:05] with the group that he is in that he
[10:07] stays with that group he stays with the
[10:10] group that he is with he do not want to
[10:13] hear the truth you shall know the truth
[10:16] and the truth shall make you free and
[10:19] then he go to when God he marcks his
[10:21] people's too HJ but God walks his people
[10:25] and we don't want to HJ we want to stay
[10:28] with God I begin to look here I say I
[10:31] want you to notice this thing right and
[10:33] we begin to build for a few minute so so
[10:35] he say the prophet said he should know
[10:37] the truth we quote that scripture a lot
[10:40] we say well you should know the truth
[10:42] and the truth shall make you free well
[10:45] that is not necessarily the way it
[10:48] go cuz a lot of time people hear the
[10:50] truth and it's still in
[10:52] bondage so this hearing the truth just
[10:55] hearing the truth and just say I hear
[10:57] the truth I made fre free that is not it
[11:01] but the Bible say if you continue in my
[11:03] word you must stay in the word to stay
[11:06] free if you continue in my word then you
[11:09] shall know the truth and the truth shall
[11:11] make you
[11:12] free talking about prison for a few
[11:15] minutes now I want you to notice
[11:18] here I want you to notice these few
[11:20] things poters I want to use when Jesus
[11:24] when the first Man was created that God
[11:27] created on Earth
[11:30] put him in the Garden of Eden yeah and
[11:33] he said to her I'm giving you Dominion
[11:36] right I'm the Lord over you Paul I'm the
[11:39] Lord over you Adam Hallelujah in other
[11:41] words I rule you what did he do the
[11:45] first man that God ever created and
[11:49] spoke into it he walked out on the earth
[11:52] that man was a prisoner yeah he was a he
[11:56] was a prisoner to eternal life right and
[11:59] as long as he believed and stayed with
[12:01] God word he was B by eternal life Adam
[12:05] should never have broke the Bell that
[12:08] Adam should never had escaped right he
[12:11] was in eternal life he had a life
[12:15] sentence Adam had a life sentence and
[12:18] long as you stay behind the word
[12:20] continue in my word you got eternal life
[12:23] Adam Adam had a life
[12:25] sentence but Satan came along
[12:29] and Satan begin to set up a plan so Adam
[12:33] can escape yeah and only to escape God
[12:38] prison to escape God prison is actually
[12:42] is a
[12:43] felony Hallelujah in other word Adam
[12:46] committed a felony against God
[12:49] hallelujah and when he did Escape Satan
[12:52] put him on death
[12:53] row Adam didn't have to die until he
[12:56] escape now Adam is on the death row
[12:59] right now Adam know what it feel like to
[13:00] die he shouldn't have know that Adam
[13:03] should never had tasted death he was on
[13:07] Life Center but Satan got him to
[13:10] escape look at this here in other words
[13:12] you say what he do I want you to notice
[13:14] these few things I want to bring to your
[13:16] attention a
[13:18] felony a felony is a a felony is an
[13:22] interment is a is is a a punishment it
[13:27] in other words it is is punishment in
[13:29] fact by death or in prison you know a
[13:33] life sentence a a felony is is counted
[13:36] as uh as as
[13:39] robbery felony is counted as rape felony
[13:44] is counted as uh uh hom homicide felony
[13:48] sign at all these things that we do rap
[13:51] robbery uh all these things is felonies
[13:54] in the natural they all got a lay they
[13:58] all got a a prison sentence to it how if
[14:01] you break it do one thing automatic you
[14:03] saying I want to go to prison how so a
[14:06] felony is a present is is a penalty or
[14:09] it could mean
[14:11] death so ath can send you to death Ro so
[14:16] now when Adam fell Hallelujah he fell
[14:18] from eternal life he fell from his
[14:21] eternal life sentence right Satan put
[14:23] him on death row exactly Satan put him
[14:26] on death row see because now no longer
[14:30] will a man be able to live a thousand
[14:32] years on earth right Hallelujah he why
[14:34] become man on death road cuz D with the
[14:36] Lord is a thousand years and a thousand
[14:38] years at a day how meusa live 969 years
[14:42] the oldest man that ever live but he
[14:44] never lived out a thousand years he was
[14:46] on death rad he had to die H that why we
[14:50] come back to eternal life again in the
[14:52] Millennium we walk out for a thousand
[14:55] years how to to pick up that old sa and
[14:58] live
[14:59] Eternal day
[15:01] on right how they begin to look here I'm
[15:04] going to go in here and look at this
[15:06] look Clos so we begin to realize but I
[15:08] want you begin to realize felonies how
[15:10] the things that we do how now you said
[15:12] brother Joel I use the term a felony is
[15:17] Rob if you rob
[15:20] somebody you done done something against
[15:23] somebody will yeah a force you took it
[15:28] by force
[15:29] right a robbery and I begin to say what
[15:33] do they got to do with the kingdom of
[15:35] God yeah robbery got to do a lot with
[15:38] the kingdom of God cuz the Bible says
[15:40] Satan come to
[15:42] steal kill and Rob right that is the
[15:46] three attributes of his coming yeah to
[15:48] kill steal and Rob right Jesus said
[15:52] these words will a man rob God right
[15:55] right right will a man commit a telling
[15:58] the oh God right when a man do not pay
[16:02] his ties and his offering he is he is a
[16:06] robber he's stealing from God he's the
[16:10] same anointing that old Judas is is on
[16:13] that man he's a thief I you let me use
[16:16] this here let me make this play in St
[16:18] John 12 you know when Jesus when Judas
[16:21] when this woman chck the
[16:23] allil and she came and she was KN Jesus
[16:26] feet and and all these things were
[16:28] taking the Romans in there Judah says
[16:32] why to this woman knowing his feet which
[16:35] is explicit all won't she give us all to
[16:39] the poor yeah that it price love the
[16:42] Bible say he didn't care nothing for the
[16:44] poor right the Bible say he was a thief
[16:47] right and had been stealing out of the
[16:50] money bag right so he was concerned
[16:53] about his own pocket he was not
[16:55] concerned about the gospel right that
[16:57] why Judas never made
[16:59] because he was a thief from the
[17:01] beginning that what God never gave him a
[17:03] place HJ in other word he had the
[17:05] attribute of sat in him and robbery does
[17:09] not always mean hallah I'm I'm tiing
[17:12] over robbery mean got the pr life the
[17:15] time with the word the time with Christ
[17:17] if you rob God right Amen Let take this
[17:21] thing here for a little further here I
[17:23] just throw the things in to get disturb
[17:25] our minds in the way remember how so
[17:27] that was that
[17:29] so that what man man have begun to Rob
[17:31] God is more than one way in more than
[17:34] one way he said in other words if for
[17:36] you ought to be convicted for something
[17:39] or something amen something got to have
[17:42] you in
[17:43] bondage how something got to have you in
[17:46] bondage either you be in bondage to God
[17:50] or you can be in bondage to a Doctrine
[17:53] something that's false that carry you
[17:55] down the wrong road and you cannot get
[17:57] away from it right that's
[17:59] bondage Hallelujah in other words I
[18:01] begin to look at these things that I was
[18:03] studying these things out I'm talking
[18:05] about being a PR most people's in
[18:07] bundage by
[18:08] fear fear is the biggest test Master
[18:11] over people life he a demon CU we all
[18:15] got to come man you almost preached my
[18:17] message today sorry I was going to use
[18:19] that me he got to talk about F that we
[18:22] start talking about that day so fear is
[18:24] one of the things I had in my T how so
[18:26] fear is one of the most powerful test
[18:29] Masters how the devil you to hold you in
[18:32] prison to Satan to keep you on death
[18:35] road because he know as long as you Fe
[18:37] God can't heal you right T would not
[18:40] move if you fear it right demon would
[18:43] not move if you Fe on demon that what
[18:45] Jesus said I did not give you the spirit
[18:48] I did not give you the spirit of fear
[18:51] but I gave you the spirit the spirit of
[18:53] peace and of a sound
[18:55] mind how because fear pace of Visions is
[18:59] not real what it do it's stealing you
[19:02] from Faith it's robbing you from faith I
[19:05] would believe but what about this no you
[19:07] need to forget about that and just
[19:09] believe God hallelujah other words it
[19:11] ain't no what about this and what about
[19:13] that I believe God word against every
[19:16] obstacle I believe that God said he was
[19:18] a Healer he was a deliverer I don't care
[19:20] what the devil say he not going to rob
[19:22] me out of my
[19:26] faith let look at this stay here a
[19:28] little closer let's just take a look Rob
[19:31] I'm talking about I'm just talking about
[19:33] Rob and thievery so you said brother
[19:36] Jewel let's here see we go in the
[19:37] religious realm because we think in the
[19:40] day that everything that look like God
[19:43] is God but everything that look like God
[19:46] ain't God how a lot of we got I tell you
[19:50] what let me just use a quotation for a
[19:52] second he was
[19:54] speaking uh he was speaking on this
[19:57] message choosing of a brother
[19:59] more peoples is robbed by human Spirits
[20:05] more than any other
[20:07] thing more people look to man more they
[20:11] look to God that why today we find
[20:14] people falling away from the faith
[20:16] because they not looking at God they
[20:18] looking at what man do right but God say
[20:21] look I he the author and the finish of
[20:24] our faith Glory yes sir he said this is
[20:27] the problem here
[20:29] he says he says the same implies the
[20:31] choosing the church now you watch now
[20:36] now you must pray over the church that
[20:38] you are fellowshiping then because
[20:40] church has
[20:42] Spirits
[20:44] PL not singular yeah because it
[20:47] shouldn't be but one spirit in the
[20:49] church Hallelujah it should not be
[20:51] plural many spirits in the church
[20:54] because they but one Spirit One Faith
[20:57] one Lord and one
[20:59] baptism that's what the power of God lay
[21:02] not in the spirit but in our spirit if
[21:05] the same spirit that raised Christ from
[21:08] the dead if it dwell in you it will
[21:11] bring your body to the same level
[21:13] Revelation he
[21:15] had but churches has
[21:19] Spirits then he said now I want you now
[21:21] I want to not be a critic but I
[21:25] recognize I I am an old man I'm I got to
[21:28] leave here one of these days but I have
[21:31] got to answer at the day of judgment for
[21:33] what I say tonight or any other time and
[21:35] therefore I got to be dead earn truly
[21:37] convicted convict you go into a church
[21:40] you just watch the behavior of the
[21:42] church you just watch the pastor and you
[21:46] will usually find that the PE the church
[21:48] act like the pastor does nothing wrong
[21:52] but acting like the pastor if he
[21:53] preaching the word because if he
[21:56] preaching the word you're not acting
[21:58] like him you are acting like the word of
[22:00] power of the Holy Ghost he preaching but
[22:03] if he preaching himself
[22:05] right if he preaching himself then you
[22:09] acting like him because that's his
[22:12] Spirit he preaching to you sometime I
[22:15] wonder if we just not get in one another
[22:17] Spirits instead of the Holy Ghost that's
[22:21] why today I say here we got more thiefs
[22:23] in the message how end of the word what
[22:26] they call the day when somebody steal
[22:30] identity yes that's the word identity St
[22:34] somebody get your identity and other
[22:36] word but in the me and and when you say
[22:39] somebody steal your identity what would
[22:41] you call that a

[24:40] ruption right does not even mean that
[24:42] you
[24:43] saved because you got the Holy Ghost and
[24:46] now let me just read this the reason I
[24:49] say this we talking about thevery how
[24:52] because we realize here this is the AG
[24:54] Satan is come to kill steal and destroy
[24:58] right he's trying to get everything he
[25:00] can and when Satan is done with you he
[25:03] to get rid of you Satan to talk you in
[25:05] the Rob in the bank then he go back and
[25:08] call the police on you
[25:10] yeah he T me into getting drunk one
[25:13] night he call the police T Elija for
[25:15] four
[25:17] years dirty
[25:23] devil

[25:28] and other word I'm saying that to let
[25:29] you know he's not your friend Hallelujah
[25:32] in other words he's a thief he's a liar
[25:35] he's a he's a murder how how you can
[25:37] trust somebody like that brother BR say
[25:40] i' rather have a drunk with me than a
[25:42] murder right a liar excuse me right but
[25:47] then look at this thing real quick we
[25:49] talking about a Thief Identity thieves
[25:52] okay look here the Bible says here in St
[25:56] Matthew say many any will come to me
[25:58] that
[25:59] day saying Lord Lord right have not we
[26:03] prophesied in thy name Lord have not we
[26:07] cast out devils in thy name that say
[26:09] Matthew 7:21 you want read it he said
[26:12] have not we done great one is ass sign
[26:14] in thy name and Jesus says depart from
[26:18] me right I never knew you that's right
[26:22] it never was an intimate relationship
[26:24] between me and you now what we got right
[26:27] here I said the what we have right here
[26:29] is identity thieves what they doing they
[26:32] are stealing from the anointing of God
[26:35] to glorify
[26:36] thems the television Val what they do
[26:40] they steal from God's anointing they see
[26:43] Power they see the Holy Ghost move but
[26:45] you don't see the life and if it is not
[26:48] burn the same life that Jesus Christ had
[26:50] then is not none of his because we not
[26:53] mag we do not we do not look at how many
[26:56] gifts we got we look at get the F we bur
[26:59] so the life is known by the tree is
[27:01] known by food outside of that you got
[27:05] impersonation right a thievery of the
[27:08] anointing of Jesus Satan was a
[27:10] thief he tried to steal God's glory for
[27:14] himself and man says that try to operate
[27:17] in the law of healing operating in the
[27:19] law of Prophecy without the life is a
[27:22] thief power of pect church is satanic
[27:25] how you using God glory to glorify and
[27:28] Jesus said I don't know you why because
[27:30] there was no faith there was no life to
[27:33] make it
[27:35] work see gifts and calling a move if
[27:40] people got faith to believe it it could
[27:42] happen but don't mean that because you
[27:45] got the Holy Ghost anointed on you that
[27:48] you that you got it h that does not mean
[27:50] that you got it in the M of
[27:53] leadership this a quote I want to use
[27:56] here in the M of the leadership he said
[27:59] the choice of your conduct you
[28:03] say you cannot mix it now you either for
[28:07] God or against God and if you try to use
[28:10] God glory and not be in the Holy Ghost
[28:14] then you against God right so you
[28:16] stealing from his anointing you stealing
[28:18] from his glory how you identity if
[28:21] you're trying to be an impersonator is
[28:23] somebody that's trying to act like
[28:25] somebody else but not really got the
[28:26] real person
[28:28] Hallelujah and he says here and you
[28:30] against God and the outside expression
[28:32] shows exactly what's on the inside see
[28:35] the cerber you may you may think well I
[28:38] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm
[28:41] going to heaven that does not mean a
[28:42] thing that did not mean one thing you
[28:45] you going to heaven no sir you can have
[28:48] the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour
[28:51] in your life right in your life and
[28:54] still be lost and go to hell
[28:58] if it just fall on your spirit you will
[29:00] do these gifts you would do these signs
[29:02] of Wonder and still be L but if it ever
[29:05] fall in your
[29:07] soul how if it ever fall in your soul
[29:11] then nothing can separate you you're a
[29:13] prisoner for life amen yes sir now look
[29:17] at this thing here I say if we didn't
[29:21] have prisons we got to deal with things
[29:23] that's trying to hold us yeah trying to
[29:26] hold us out trying to keep us from going
[29:30] on into the word let us look at one in
[29:34] let me look at Second
[29:37] Corinthians second
[29:39] Corinthians the 10th
[29:42] chapter and the fourth and fifth verse
[29:44] Paul speaking here second Corinthians
[29:46] the 10th
[29:47] chapter the fourth and the fifth verse
[29:50] Paul was speaking these words right here
[29:53] he was letting us know we got to keep in
[29:55] we got to keep these things right that's
[29:58] trying to hold us back things are
[30:00] keeping us in bondage Hallelujah here
[30:03] what Paul says right here uh Second
[30:05] Corinthians the 4th verse 2 Corinthians
[30:09] the 10th chapter and the 4th verse
[30:11] says for the weers our Warfare are not
[30:16] conal but mightily through God the
[30:19] pulling down a stronghold right a hold
[30:22] it something that's keeping you from
[30:25] being a preson of a God right something
[30:28] keeping you from your pright something
[30:29] keeping you from being a dedicated
[30:31] Christian is a
[30:33] stronghold it may be a
[30:35] teaching it may be a false teaching it
[30:38] may be a job it may be anything that
[30:42] holding you back from the word of God
[30:44] you are in
[30:46] bondage you see people think bondage is
[30:49] a well I just got a little sin see God
[30:52] ain't got no
[30:53] misdemeanors
[30:55] right I don't think about God in at
[30:57] least in the courtroom you get a little
[30:59] Grace you got a misin child H well you
[31:02] know I seen a man stealing onions one
[31:04] time that was not no big deal the judge
[31:07] just looked at him and say no more
[31:09] trespass said Miss Addis don't you never
[31:11] steal no more I was there in jail with
[31:13] in court when they gave him that he said
[31:15] you he said he said right now he said
[31:17] you not to go back on her property and
[31:19] you better pay her for her onions and he
[31:21] trying to tell the Jud only reason I
[31:23] stole the onion because when I eat pork
[31:24] salad I love
[31:26] onions
[31:29] am the judge say I can't believe him she
[31:31] charged him for stealing onion but
[31:34] anyway that's a misdemeanor yeah that
[31:37] but if he would have stole $25,000 for a
[31:41] bank that would have been a different
[31:43] thing it would have been a felony crime
[31:46] and the Jud wouldn't say go home he's
[31:49] not that
[31:52] home so Paul telling us
[31:55] here casting
[31:57] pulling down
[31:59] strongholds cast down
[32:02] imagination more people isound
[32:05] imagination and they Bound in any other
[32:07] realm in faith he said cast down
[32:11] imagination and every High thing that
[32:13] exalted itself against the knowledge of
[32:15] God and bring into
[32:17] captivity bring into captivity every
[32:20] thought to The Obedience of Christ the
[32:24] knowledge of God right cast down every
[32:28] thought that come against the knowledge
[32:31] of God what is the knowledge of God how
[32:34] it we should s wly after we have receive
[32:37] the knowledge right of Truth Glory now
[32:40] how would you get knowledge of Truth am
[32:42] 3 and7 says surely the Lord would do
[32:44] nothing except he reveal his secret to
[32:46] his servant the prophet so if you
[32:47] getting God knowledge it got to be a
[32:48] prophet on the scene to make it known so
[32:50] how once the knowledge come didn't demon
[32:53] going to come the CH
[32:56] teaches to try to get you to turn your
[32:58] back on what God is
[33:00] doing you you but the point of it is
[33:03] when these things come up cast them down
[33:06] don't get discouraged in your Christian
[33:08] walk stay with the message stay with
[33:12] Christ and look at this thing right here
[33:15] let's go on here and think of this thing
[33:16] on prison on Prison we looking at
[33:19] prisons a prison for Christ cuz Satan is
[33:23] going to deal with you and there a the
[33:26] attack
[33:27] it's in the it already got the world
[33:30] they serve him you know but we we we we
[33:34] putting up a resistance so now the only
[33:36] way that Satan can fight you is trying
[33:38] to get you to turn and become a prisoner
[33:43] or either escape the power of God and be
[33:46] put on death row now one thing about
[33:49] death row you put on death row and they
[33:51] tell you going to die tomorrow at 10:00
[33:52] believe me tomorrow at 10:00 you going
[33:54] to sleep
[33:55] yeah yeah
[33:57] sir you going to be sleep tomorrow at
[33:59] 10:00 but let me finish this I get back
[34:01] to that in a
[34:03] second so Paul teach this so Satan
[34:06] knows the only way he could get to a
[34:10] Christian is get us to reject the
[34:14] knowledge of truth right so now if you
[34:18] notice in that 1 Timothy 3 says that
[34:22] many shall depart from the faith yeah oh
[34:26] yeah the be a Deport there got to be
[34:28] something to cause you to get upset
[34:30] there got be something to cause you to
[34:32] want to leave how you might you might
[34:34] have been looking at event you might be
[34:36] looking at what this person said and
[34:38] what that person said over there but
[34:40] that something caus you to depart from
[34:43] the faith right and the Bible say give
[34:45] it heed to seducing spirits and
[34:48] doctrines of
[34:50] devils lead the faith not that you was
[34:53] in it you lead the faith and all of a
[34:56] sudden you lead the faith and all of a
[34:58] sudden how you you giving heed to
[35:00] seducing spirit and now in other word
[35:03] Satan got you Bound by the spirit of a
[35:05] demonic power H and now you fighting
[35:08] against the very thing that save you
[35:11] amen sir oh man I looked at this stay
[35:15] right here I'm going to deal with
[35:17] prisons then I got some good things to
[35:19] say in a second but I want to let you
[35:21] know this is a serious hour see because
[35:24] we living in an hour that we living in
[35:26] an hour that felonies have become in the
[35:30] way people look at it as a
[35:32] misdemenor you go and kill somebody
[35:35] today long as you don't shoot that dog
[35:36] you'll get
[35:39] out yeah you shoot that dog that's they
[35:42] give Li give you double life you'll get
[35:45] more life for a dog you will for a human
[35:48] Hallelujah in word my son-in-law had his
[35:50] dog uh no not a friend a friend of mine
[35:53] had his dog in the
[35:55] car and the son and he just run in the
[35:58] store just to get something right out
[36:02] but a lady was there when he come out
[36:04] had a phone calling in on him and he
[36:07] says what you doing she said that is
[36:10] animal cruelty you going to kill that
[36:13] dog and all is he said Miss I just run
[36:16] into the store he I'm I know the dog was
[36:19] in the car you better get him I don't
[36:20] play
[36:22] that I said man she's upset about the
[36:25] dog and people killing babies 44,000
[36:27] babies a year die left in the car
[36:31] Hallelujah in other words in a lot of it
[36:32] people got enough money to pay the way
[36:34] out of it right but people see felonies
[36:38] in his head how felonies in because what
[36:41] what callus them felonies to be accepted
[36:44] because men have not been able to
[36:47] discern between right and
[36:50] wrong when you lose your knowledge of
[36:53] how to discern between right and wrong
[36:56] how can you judge a nation right right
[36:59] when they'll call evil good and good
[37:02] evil amen let me look here real quick
[37:06] this ain't going to keep you all night
[37:08] but I want you
[37:10] notice we have come so
[37:13] weak and over the last let's say last 25
[37:17] years with our Christian
[37:20] vales we know that we realize that this
[37:23] nation as a nation had rejected God 1956
[37:29] she had a chance to receive it or turn
[37:31] around but the Bible say when you
[37:32] receive not the knowledge of the truth
[37:35] how then never remain no more sacrifice
[37:37] for your sin so now the knowledge of the
[37:39] truth was presented the people say we
[37:42] don't want it we want our freedom they
[37:46] chose to be mocked with
[37:48] death yes sir freedom is not being able
[37:51] to go out here and buy cigarett when you
[37:53] want to and buy B when you want that is
[37:55] not freedom freedom is when you know
[37:58] when I lay down at night I know where my
[38:00] soul
[38:01] rest H that's real
[38:03] Freedom that's right so we begin to look
[38:06] here because I say our nation was
[38:08] founded on value Christian value in God
[38:11] we trust I understand when they sat
[38:14] around and had
[38:15] meetings they would sat around the table
[38:19] all the coms and them guys in big
[38:21] offices they would sat there around the
[38:23] table and they would bring an empty
[38:25] chair and they would lead there for the
[38:28] invited guest Jesus
[38:31] Christ that when we were standing for
[38:34] something now they sat around the table
[38:37] and they do got an invited guest Jack
[38:40] Daniel it is a
[38:44] spirit it is a
[38:46] spirit but was it is a spirit but no
[38:50] longer they got the word as the absolute
[38:54] right pray because people is calling bad
[38:58] the good bad and bad
[39:01] good now I'm going to show you I'm going
[39:04] to throw this little thing in here and I
[39:06] want to baby like those saying stir up
[39:09] your mind in the way of
[39:11] remembrance I want
[39:13] brother way to come and read something
[39:15] real
[39:16] quick I was looking up in the Law
[39:21] Dictionary legal guidance you anybody
[39:23] got that book is ever law
[39:27] that was this nation was founded on was
[39:29] in this book ever law that this nation
[39:33] said that was a law and this is what we
[39:37] stand for at this time it was it was a
[39:41] law but for some way how did this law
[39:45] get swept under the rug yeah come here
[39:48] go to the mic and read it to us that one
[39:51] at the
[39:53] top crimes against nature
[39:57] sexual deviations which were considered
[39:59] crimes at common law and have been
[40:01] carried over by statutes include solomy
[40:04] and
[40:05] beastality solomy and beastality is in
[40:09] the Law Dictionary mhm yep that's it
[40:13] yeah that's it what happened to that law
[40:17] yeah when men heart turn from God right
[40:21] that's what happened because God can not
[40:24] destroy a nation until Nation totally
[40:27] reject him order St Luke 17:30 could not
[40:31] be fulfilled until that
[40:33] happened when laws that we once stood
[40:37] for it was beastality
[40:40] salamy when two men mating with each
[40:43] other was actually a crime against
[40:46] nature right but now it's accepted as
[40:49] marriage I can find a lot of things to
[40:52] go to hell for but that ain't one of
[40:53] them yeah
[40:55] right
[40:57] that is not one of them right but see
[41:00] what I'm say to say why did they do this
[41:05] because men's Hearts have turned from
[41:07] God they don't want to hear God a girl
[41:10] sneez the other day and some somebody
[41:12] Snee she said bless you they put this
[41:15] girl in
[41:17] court wonder what they say when somebody
[41:19] use the Lord name in vain yeah I ain't
[41:21] heard nobody go to court for that H I
[41:24] ain't heard nobody go to court for using
[41:26] the MF words and all this kind of stuff
[41:28] nobody went to jail for that or went to
[41:30] court for that but you say bless you
[41:32] then it become a crime they no longer
[41:36] can discern wrong from right we living
[41:40] right here now we don't need no
[41:42] interpretation we at the end time hallel
[41:44] that was going to happen say as it was
[41:46] in the days of Norah see we tried to try
[41:47] to make the events happen but we
[41:49] couldn't make them happy we had to
[41:51] happen according to prophecy to
[41:53] happen now
[41:56] I just thought I thought this is this is
[41:58] actually another message I'm on right
[42:00] here but it's so good it fits so good
[42:02] with this message that I brought in so I
[42:05] want you to notice
[42:06] here before God can ever burn this
[42:11] nation this Solomon Spirit had to raise
[42:15] because that was what they burnt solom
[42:17] Kamar for for the inmal level for the
[42:20] men's the women's did change the natural
[42:22] youth what was he preaching here and
[42:24] women begin to go with women and men
[42:27] begin to go with men what was he
[42:28] preaching there souls in prison right
[42:31] how souls in prison because he said he
[42:33] gave them over to a reate a mind that
[42:37] cannot repent anymore that's it turn
[42:39] them over to a reprobate mind to do
[42:41] those things in the flood
[42:44] pity now I ain't got a reason to destroy
[42:47] the nation so now I ain't got a reason
[42:49] to let storms come anytime they want to
[42:52] he got a reason to let hurricanes come
[42:54] anytime they want to he got a reason to
[42:55] let earthquakes come anytime they want
[42:57] why because there's no way to hold it
[42:59] all because the world have rejected him
[43:01] only reason they ain't destroyed yet the
[43:03] bride is still
[43:05] here the bride is still here thank you
[43:09] Lord that's right let me just show you
[43:12] if you never looked at it it's a
[43:14] strange I think maybe when I looked at
[43:17] it last time it was 19 states have
[43:19] accepted same seex me marriages it was
[43:23] only 19 States was left every other
[43:25] state had they accepted now I don't know
[43:27] how many it is now they have
[43:30] accepted same seex
[43:33] marriages but believe me the world going
[43:35] to go right and keep grossing in
[43:38] darkness because they don't know what's
[43:40] right and wrong they don't know nothing
[43:41] about God they ain't got God on their
[43:44] mind you sneeze you want to to B not say
[43:45] nobody bless you your best Ain to say
[43:48] shut
[43:50] up you don't have to go to court for
[43:52] that but you better not say bless you
[43:55] but I want you to know
[43:56] so you you see had you noticed this look
[44:00] at this real close all of a sudden the

[54:40] right yeah and he thought he had the
[54:42] Holy Ghost and he was killing the
[54:43] Christians and he was on his way to hell
