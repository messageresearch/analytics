[35:56] signed his name on every promise in the
[35:59] Bible amen you know tonight Dave we can
[36:03] just cash that in we can really get a
[36:05] blessing maybe I believe God's Got a

[37:27] all alone broken heart
[37:31] trying to calm the Raging battle in my
[37:36] mind
[37:39] I saw a flower blooming where it had no
[37:44] rain no
[37:46] sunshine
[37:47] and are you not that this flower
[37:52] would change the risk of my life
[38:03] my Fast Trip when I was born

[39:36] a place
[40:07] I found a place
[40:42] foreign
[41:00] ERS but we say one thing to you we
[41:03] always have a kind of a way of doing
[41:05] things here
[41:06] if you're here the first time
[41:08] we welcome you as a visitor
[41:11] okay you ever come back again don't
[41:14] expect to be welcomed
[41:16] because we don't have anything to join
[41:19] we don't have anything to be we're just
[41:21] part of the body of Christ so all around
[41:23] the world we're just one and we say to
[41:26] you that if you've never been here
[41:27] before welcome amen amen come on Tom
[41:31] Cruise Shane up in Sweetwater Tennessee
[41:34] amen
[41:37] well it's good to be back in the house
[41:38] of the Lord amen hallelujah I'm counting
[41:42] on the patience and the brotherly
[41:43] kindness I'm late
[41:45] now I once said even here I think it was
[41:48] I'd never be late again if I had to go a
[41:50] day early
[41:52] well I've got a lot of zeal I was wrong
[41:58] sometimes it don't always work you know
[42:00] I thought I'm going to be very smart man
[42:01] I'm going to buy myself a GPS
[42:04] you know we're going down the highway
[42:06] real good and I thought well we're
[42:08] perfectly aligned with what the GPS is
[42:10] saying but it didn't feel right
[42:12] and all of a sudden the GPS says take
[42:14] your next exit and turn around
[42:16] we went 50 miles out of our way using
[42:19] the GPS
[42:21] before that it was raining so hard we
[42:24] couldn't even see how's this machine
[42:26] just just changed its mind
[42:31] I guess I was wrong
[42:36] so it's not her fault and I guess I'll
[42:39] take the blame though
[42:41] but I'm glad I'm glad because it's not
[42:44] so bad just to say you're wrong
[42:46] you know that makes me wrap your
[42:49] material in this day amen I'm glad this
[42:51] message you know it upset me very bad
[42:53] when something says you have 12 minutes
[42:56] and you'll be there and all sudden it
[42:57] says you got 48 minutes and you'll be
[42:59] there
[43:01] you know I once preached GPS if we could
[43:03] ever forget where we're going and just
[43:05] follow the voice of the GPS we'd make it
[43:07] well I'll hold to that but not the Tom
[43:10] Tom
[43:12] now I'm going to call it the Tom Tom
[43:16] but uh God's GPS will get you there and
[43:19] you don't have to worry the traveling
[43:21] the path you're making just follow the
[43:23] voice of almighty God he will get you
[43:25] there and he's not an electronic voice
[43:28] he is a spiritual voice that will lead
[43:31] and guide the bride to all truth and
[43:34] I've been reading in the Book of Ezekiel
[43:35] and there's a place near the end of
[43:38] Ezekiel where God is
[43:40] hollering at the priests and the Levites
[43:43] he said you Levites have caused all all
[43:46] of Israel to fall into idolatry you have
[43:49] caused Israel to fall apart and and your
[43:52] iniquity is going to remain with you and
[43:54] a little bit later on he goes back to he
[43:55] says but you Levites you cause Israel to
[43:58] fall and you are going to Bear your
[44:00] shame and your iniquity and you think
[44:02] what a horrible thing to be judged by
[44:04] God like that these are the the priests
[44:07] that have done such wrong and then he
[44:08] says then he says but he says you will
[44:12] be in the house of the Lord and you will
[44:14] be in the office of a priesthood and I'm
[44:16] going to have you do this I'm going to
[44:17] have you do this and maybe do this he
[44:19] says but the sons of zadok he says they
[44:21] stayed true the whole while and he says
[44:23] they will be able to draw near unto me
[44:26] you know and I read about that and I
[44:28] thought what a wonderful thing it would
[44:29] be to be a son of zadok in that day amen
[44:32] then you're just reading a couple other
[44:34] little spots in the Bible get to the
[44:36] book of Hebrews even and it says that or
[44:39] it says the blood of bulls and goats
[44:42] could never make the worshiper perched
[44:44] it could never clear the conscience and
[44:47] I thought no I don't want to be in the
[44:48] days of zadok I want to be in this day
[44:52] because if I had to type myself to
[44:54] anybody it'd be the Levites I spent 28
[44:57] years of my life messing everything up I
[44:59] could I'm so glad for the message of the
[45:01] hour but you know those priests could go
[45:04] back and they could never find a
[45:07] conscience clearing sin killing method
[45:10] to to lead and guide them along the way
[45:12] although they live straight and they
[45:14] live clean
[45:15] how is so is it in this day so many
[45:18] straight Living Clean living people
[45:19] caught in doctrines of three Gods caught
[45:22] in doctrines of all sorts of false
[45:25] things and here we have the truth
[45:28] and here we had a high priest step to
[45:30] the throne of Mercy for us to go up
[45:33] calvary's hill with our sins on his back
[45:36] to carry all of our you know I'm so glad
[45:38] uh Isaiah says he bore my shame in my
[45:41] iniquity because I don't have to bear my
[45:43] iniquity he bore my iniquity
[45:46] he Bears our shame and this message is a
[45:49] superior way it is a higher level of
[45:52] knowing god it is a more personal
[45:54] relationship with Jesus Christ it is the
[45:57] it is the Fulfillment of God's Mysteries
[45:59] that he wanted to bring to a people and
[46:02] he's brought that people to such a place
[46:04] they oh they can live with taking a
[46:07] wrong turn or they can live with falling
[46:10] even because they're able to get back up
[46:12] that is the strength of this message we
[46:15] can get back up when we fall and I'm so
[46:17] glad of that and I can't wait to hear
[46:19] the preaching the church is doing real
[46:21] good in Sweet Water and uh my children
[46:24] I'm just a first-time parent they went
[46:26] and grew up on me they're working today
[46:30] they've got a little vegetable stand and
[46:32] one wasn't good enough now they got two
[46:34] little vegetable stands they got
[46:36] themselves a little Ministry they're
[46:38] earning their weights or church camps
[46:40] and and getting other people through the
[46:42] church camps and they knew they knew a
[46:45] young man years ago his name is Kyler
[46:48] and uh he was some kind of oh like a
[46:51] soft Baptist good kid though a good
[46:54] straight living kid and his dad wrote a
[46:56] book one time and I remember reading it
[46:57] and it was a terrible book and at the
[47:00] end of it it even said that Jerusalem
[47:02] was the seat of the Antichrist mystery
[47:04] Babylon I looked at that and my family
[47:06] says well what do you think of this book
[47:08] so just got a nice cover

[47:19] know where he's at and he's supposed to
[47:21] be a pastor and she's supposed to be a
[47:22] pastor's wife and a minister and uh Port
[47:25] Kyler and I always hat sideways I guess
[47:27] that's what happens when boys parents
[47:29] split up their hats turned sideways and
[47:31] he's got a bunch of holes in his ears I
[47:33] guess you start leaking and he is just
[47:36] in such a mess but he loves my children
[47:38] and my children and his people are not
[47:41] the same Doctrine but you know they've
[47:42] invited them to brother Burley Williams

[48:02] against being baptized in the name of
[48:03] the Lord Jesus Christ he's put no so uh

[48:15] it's exciting you know a little group of
[48:17] Christians went up to the uh to the
[48:20] courthouse in Washington DC to the
[48:22] Supreme Court House and they looked at
[48:25] it and right before they left they said
[48:27] we're going to pray on the steps of the
[48:28] courthouse did anybody hear about this

[1:01:12] Samuel name in Gainesville we had a
[1:01:13] wonderful opportunity to be able to go
[1:01:15] up and fellowship with them and you know
[1:01:17] and had a wonderful time fellowshipping
[1:01:19] and all and I told them the only thing
[1:01:21] that it didn't matter how they spelled
[1:01:23] it what it is I still don't like
[1:01:25] guacamole's

[1:01:57] appreciate him coming down
[1:02:01] amen
[1:02:09] God bless you man well it's also a great
[1:02:13] privilege for me to be here in these
[1:02:16] meetings I just found out yesterday
[1:02:18] that you were having some fellowship
[1:02:20] meetings so I said well let's go and
[1:02:22] meet with the brothers it's always a
[1:02:23] pleasure to meet some of the people that
[1:02:26] we have not been able to meet before
[1:02:27] amen and since we are scatter all over
[1:02:31] it's always a privilege to meet you and
[1:02:34] others for the first time even though we
[1:02:35] know that we are family
[1:02:37] because uh the brother said brother
[1:02:40] they'll say you're a visitor you know if
[1:02:42] this is the first time I've been you are
[1:02:43] a visitor but I never feel like a
[1:02:45] visitor you know wherever I go I just
[1:02:47] feel part of the family because if
[1:02:50] you're not willing to feel or able to
[1:02:52] feel as part of the family then you're
[1:02:53] not part of the family that's right
[1:02:55] that's right so but since we know that
[1:02:58] we are one family then I don't feel no
[1:02:59] stranger you know amen
[1:03:03] so it's great it's great it's great to
[1:03:05] be here with you and uh to see some of
[1:03:09] the faces for the first time and I hope
[1:03:11] it's not going to be the the only time
[1:03:13] so I come often actually here to uh
[1:03:16] Atlanta or to Gainesville to be with the
[1:03:19] brothers a few times a few years we
[1:03:22] started a little work in the Atlanta
[1:03:24] area
[1:03:26] we have some family you know that
[1:03:28] took the message they believed the
[1:03:30] message so we had to send somebody from
[1:03:31] our church in Chicago
[1:03:33] so that they can be with them and help
[1:03:34] them you know they'll always have
[1:03:36] somebody to to start a church you know
[1:03:38] because the people need somebody they're
[1:03:40] by their side so we started the work
[1:03:42] since we usually do missionary work in
[1:03:44] different places you know I've been kind
[1:03:46] of all over
[1:03:48] um I spent some time in Chicago it's
[1:03:50] been been the pastor in Chicago and some
[1:03:52] of the time being outside you know like
[1:03:54] this summer I haven't been too much in
[1:03:57] in in the area in Chicago too much
[1:03:59] outside
[1:04:00] so but then some of these people in
[1:04:04] Gainesville like the family the Reyes
[1:04:06] family came into the message we decided
[1:04:08] to move from Atlanta to Gainesville to
[1:04:11] be the side of the the state but we
[1:04:15] ended up you know having a little group
[1:04:18] staying there you know in in the area of
[1:04:20] Atlanta for the people that's over there
[1:04:22] that are more comfortable being there so
[1:04:24] we decided to move it over here and be
[1:04:25] in Gainesville
[1:04:27] very close to Lula Georgia so anyways we
[1:04:32] just work this way and trying to do any
[1:04:35] thing that we can to help anybody we
[1:04:39] still find one seat here and one seat
[1:04:41] there you know still willing to hear the
[1:04:43] message of the hours
[1:04:44] and you get surprised sometimes we think
[1:04:47] that there is nobody else but still you
[1:04:48] find some here and wonderful we're still
[1:04:51] doing whatever we can so it's a great
[1:04:54] privilege and uh what I want to say just
[1:04:57] like brother uh
[1:04:58] Samuel said we don't have no singers
[1:05:01] with us
[1:05:02] so you're going to have to forgive us
[1:05:05] and we have some singers actually but
[1:05:08] I'm not sure if they're prepared though
[1:05:11] let's see I don't know
[1:05:17] I'm saying in Spanish
[1:05:23] because they didn't prepare anything we
[1:05:26] just found that up at the services
[1:05:27] yesterday but I know that we're at home
[1:05:29] and if they want to sing in Spanish I I
[1:05:31] think you don't mind I mean
[1:05:38] you know when I I heard the brother
[1:05:40] singing back there it says man you know
[1:05:42] he's singing so I should sing something
[1:05:43] myself you know
[1:05:46] laughs I'm kind of a young and I said
[1:05:48] that I cannot sing I mean we can sing
[1:05:50] something so I don't know maybe one of
[1:05:51] the sisters sister you might want to
[1:05:54] sing a little a little something a
[1:05:55] little chorus or something don't you
[1:05:57] know since okay
[1:06:06] okay
[1:06:14] she is not prepared but we are prepared
[1:06:18] because we need to get prepared you know
[1:06:20] this is our base preparation
[1:06:23] unfortunately I'm not a singer otherwise
[1:06:25] I will sing something though but
[1:06:27] sometimes I sing it in church
[1:06:30] and I suppose they sang before they can
[1:06:33] sing at least a little chorus so we're
[1:06:34] gonna let it come and man just say sing
[1:06:36] something
[1:06:40] doesn't matter
[1:06:51] yeah
[1:06:53] amen amen hallelujah
[1:07:00] foreign
[1:07:52] deals this time again
[1:08:11] dinosaurs
[1:08:41] foreign
[1:09:08] I believe
[1:09:24] say
[1:09:29] happy
[1:09:34] again
[1:09:59] foreign
[1:10:33] thank you
[1:10:37] foreign
[1:10:59] have we missed anybody whoa is there any
[1:11:02] other pasture in here that we haven't
[1:11:05] recognized
[1:11:09] this talks to somebody's supposed to
[1:11:11] sing from here so don't ask me if
[1:11:13] they're supposed to have done brother
[1:11:15] Joe you should get out here and get and
[1:11:17] they're they're supposed to get
[1:11:18] everything together and have a little
[1:11:20] singing for you and kind of a quartet
[1:11:23] but uh right we don't know where they're
[1:11:25] at because they're scattered all over
[1:11:27] the place but while they're coming I
[1:11:30] guess you wander up at the front of here
[1:11:31] while you're looking at what most people
[1:11:33] think is two pictures of Hoffman's head
[1:11:36] of Christ
[1:11:38] you know
[1:11:40] but if you'll come up later and pay
[1:11:42] close attention
[1:11:44] you will see the difference
[1:11:46] yes Hoffman painted a picture of what he
[1:11:50] thought Christ looked like and you know
[1:11:51] right around said he thought Hoffman was
[1:11:53] the best picture of all of them and
[1:11:55] that's fine I just think it's a
[1:11:56] beautiful picture but the story is that
[1:12:00] he painted a picture
[1:12:01] well then some years later he went back
[1:12:04] and he painted another picture most
[1:12:07] people don't know that story he painted
[1:12:09] one of the Lord Jesus at what he thought
[1:12:11] he looked like at 30 years of age
[1:12:14] then he
[1:12:16] painted one of what he thought he looked
[1:12:18] like it 33 years of age
[1:12:20] all right even according to the artist
[1:12:23] you know the people who that know they
[1:12:26] said he had developed greater in his
[1:12:28] ability to paint over the amount of time
[1:12:31] that he had put in between you know the
[1:12:33] two drawings but still if you look at
[1:12:36] them real close you'll see that one is
[1:12:41] young looking man
[1:12:43] everything is kind of clothing is kind
[1:12:45] of you know natural looking than the
[1:12:47] other
[1:12:48] the other the clothing is kind of worn
[1:12:51] he's more Shaggy looking
[1:12:53] and he looks more older yes
[1:12:56] and
[1:12:58] you know
[1:13:00] that's me in between
[1:13:02] because that's what caused him to look
[1:13:06] like that that's right that's right from
[1:13:08] what he was at 33 I mean 30 to 33 that's
[1:13:12] what my I'm the one at college that so
[1:13:16] that's me between amen amen amen amen
[1:13:33] routine
[1:13:34] tears in the eyes

[1:13:48] hands

[1:13:53] thorns in his bro and only God could

[1:33:44] I told the sisters in the back I ran
[1:33:46] away from church with my piano player
[1:33:48] and that's her right there
[1:33:50] she plays the piano so we had to get
[1:33:52] somebody else to fill in for her this
[1:33:54] week but uh I'm sure glad that she came
[1:33:58] with me
[1:34:01] oh my
[1:34:03] you know what that GPS really is that's
[1:34:05] God's predestinated seed
[1:34:08] inside you as long as you got that GPS
[1:34:10] you'll be all right
[1:34:12] y'all please forgive me I got I already
[1:34:16] apologized to brother Samuel here and a
[1:34:19] brother Wade
[1:34:20] uh and I'll have to
[1:34:24] say that uh I don't know if anybody else
[1:34:26] came in after brother
[1:34:28] Tom or not brother Christian but I did
[1:34:31] just barely beat him here so
[1:34:34] if you're gonna give him Grace you're
[1:34:36] gonna give me Grace too
[1:34:38] all right come in just a little bit
[1:34:40] before he did I was about 15 minutes
[1:34:42] late just only that's a quarter of a
[1:34:45] hour
[1:34:46] they're docking me for my likeness
[1:34:50] but uh
[1:34:51] I um
[1:34:53] just take it down the offering brother
[1:34:57] oh innocent the Lord good to us
[1:35:03] but uh I'm really glad to have my wife
[1:35:07] with me and we've got two preachers to
[1:35:11] cover home base and my song leader is
[1:35:14] going to be there my Deacon's gonna be
[1:35:15] there and we got a special piano player
[1:35:18] coming in tomorrow and everything's just
[1:35:19] all right we come here just to let off
[1:35:22] their pressure and help fellowship and I
[1:35:25] just feel good about being here amen
[1:35:29] just feel real good about being here so
[1:35:32] now let's just concentrate and set our
[1:35:34] hearts and affections on things above
[1:35:36] we've got to know one another we've
[1:35:38] expressed our uh selves and uh brother
[1:35:42] I'm not no longer
[1:35:44] it's not necessary to make me welcome
[1:35:46] because I've been here before I've been
[1:35:48] behind the pulpit here before and I
[1:35:51] appreciate the privilege for the day of
[1:35:53] real my to me one of the greatest
[1:35:59] um
[1:36:00] commendations that you could give to a
[1:36:03] man or honors would be to give him your
[1:36:06] pulpit and then for a man to take
[1:36:08] advantage of that or abuse that to me
[1:36:11] that'd be one of the most terrible
[1:36:13] things a man could do too yeah amen and
[1:36:15] so I highly regard the position here of
[1:36:18] being behind this sacred desk and God
[1:36:21] bless this assembly now the importance
[1:36:24] of Fellowship
[1:36:27] really understood and and by the grace
[1:36:30] of God today we'll go out with a greater
[1:36:32] understanding than when we came in amen
[1:36:35] but we'll see and I believe this is
[1:36:38] going to what y'all are doing the
[1:36:39] efforts for the day when you're putting
[1:36:41] forth here
[1:36:42] and and The Minister's meetings brother
[1:36:44] Calhoun and the different things you
[1:36:45] know Fellowship has to start from the
[1:36:49] top down that's right God is the author
[1:36:52] of Fellowship amen amen God
[1:36:57] is the author of Fellowship
[1:37:01] oh my amen yes
[1:37:04] now just think about the scripture we
[1:37:06] just read for a moment
[1:37:10] the blood of Jesus Christ is not even
[1:37:13] efficacious it's no longer effective to
[1:37:17] you or to me that blood is absolutely no
[1:37:21] and void and of no use whatsoever I
[1:37:24] don't
[1:37:25] the Bible says if we walk in the light
[1:37:30] then we will have Fellowship one with
[1:37:33] another and then and then only does the
[1:37:37] blood cleanse us all sin
[1:37:41] amen if you're walking in the light as
[1:37:44] he's in the light you're going to have
[1:37:46] fellowship with light right amen says we
[1:37:49] should not have fellowship with Devils
[1:37:51] right that's right cannot fellowship
[1:37:54] with Darkness amen if you say that
[1:37:57] you're walking in the light and you
[1:37:59] fellowship and with Darkness you're not
[1:38:01] in the truth you're lying amen amen is
[1:38:04] that okay yes yes holy my the purpose
[1:38:10] God's Great purpose
[1:38:15] in the message knoweth that not the
[1:38:17] prophet said God's whole purpose was the
[1:38:19] church right yes and the church age book
[1:38:22] he said in order to give himself a
[1:38:24] purpose and a reason in existence of
[1:38:27] being
[1:38:28] he had to predestivate a church that
[1:38:32] would need Redemption amen
[1:38:35] amen think about how much God loves you
[1:38:39] how much
[1:38:40] fellowship with you
[1:38:43] yes that's right
[1:38:49] he had no purpose and existence apart
[1:38:53] from you right amen
[1:38:56] hearing that our Prophet tried to commit
[1:38:59] suicide don't you know that was only
[1:39:01] reflecting something that God what is
[1:39:04] reflecting yes God had no purpose of
[1:39:07] existence
[1:39:09] wow did he want to commit suicide he
[1:39:13] tried to do it ain't no beating around
[1:39:15] the bush about it he tried to take his

[1:42:27] of who is this melchistic
[1:42:30] oh my
[1:42:32] God and
[1:42:34] the prophet of God said something on
[1:42:37] there I'd never heard him say before I
[1:42:39] hadn't heard the text before now okay
[1:42:40] you hear it but hearing we hear it off
[1:42:43] sometimes that's right but in there he
[1:42:45] said you know the whole purpose of God
[1:42:47] now I'm paraphrasing you'll have to go
[1:42:49] get it yourself you know when you
[1:42:51] paraphrase something at least it'll
[1:42:53] create a little incentive for you go
[1:42:54] check it out okay quit your appetite but
[1:42:58] I don't have the quote before me but he
[1:43:00] said something on this order he said
[1:43:02] that was the reason that God created man
[1:43:05] in the first place was for Fellowship
[1:43:07] amen amen
[1:43:12] and in the first place was for
[1:43:14] Fellowship
[1:43:17] oh how sweet and how pleasant it is for
[1:43:20] Brethren to dwell together and unity oh
[1:43:24] it's like the annoying oil it was poured
[1:43:26] upon the head of Aaron ran down on his
[1:43:28] spirit and even to the skirts of his
[1:43:30] garbage yes oh he got a baptism of love
[1:43:33] and fellowship and unity that's what we
[1:43:36] need amen when we get a baptism of love
[1:43:40] the church can go forward
[1:43:43] half the Little Women in the East for
[1:43:47] the tavern around their head to show

[1:44:31] out when she committed adultery yeah

[1:44:36] and so that was a sign of something that
[1:44:39] was unfaithful right amen and all she
[1:44:42] got concerned because her husband she
[1:44:44] knew it was time for him to return amen

[1:50:28] kindness you'll never get it on that one
[1:50:30] up to perfect love that's right
[1:50:34] Prophet said brotherly kindness in the
[1:50:36] Statue of a perfect man he said he's
[1:50:38] putting up with one another yeah
[1:50:42] learning to put up with one another
[1:50:44] that's right and you know if you'd put
[1:50:46] up with one another long enough you you
[1:50:48] learn after a while she's kind of like
[1:50:49] your wife you know or
[1:50:51] your husband
[1:50:54] After Fall it'll be where you just
[1:50:56] realize hey you can't do that one
[1:50:57] another
[1:50:58] and I believe that's the way we gotta
[1:51:00] come
[1:51:01] amen I just need one another or loving
[1:51:04] one another putting up with one another
[1:51:06] but we need to be the place to where we
[1:51:08] realize we gotta have one enough
[1:51:14] thank you
[1:51:16] Glory nothing on you
[1:51:19] of Godly Fellowship
[1:51:23] yes and the purpose
[1:51:25] the purpose of Fellowship is to bring us
[1:51:29] to a relationship right yeah amen every
[1:51:33] one of you we all live
[1:51:35] in a three-room house that makes us all
[1:51:39] on the same level right amen I don't
[1:51:42] care you might live in the Mansion you
[1:51:43] say oh brother you stopped me I got
[1:51:45] three bedrooms and three baths or
[1:51:47] whatever listen you all live we all live
[1:51:50] in the same size three room house that's
[1:51:53] what the prophet said how many of those
[1:51:55] said that amen yeah and his body's own
[1:51:58] spirit
[1:51:59] we're all in this we're locked in right
[1:52:01] here and then he also identified those
[1:52:04] three rooms
[1:52:06] as I think he said on this order
[1:52:09] the um kitchen The Parlor in the bedroom
[1:52:12] yes and he said now in here you know I
[1:52:16] like two couples whenever maybe they
[1:52:18] come together they get married or
[1:52:19] whatever
[1:52:20] and uh he said out here they eat we have
[1:52:24] Fellowship I guess we're going to have
[1:52:25] that here's what I heard
[1:52:27] oh that'd be wonderful because you know
[1:52:31] what I didn't have much breakfast this
[1:52:32] morning but I had some good fellowship
[1:52:36] with the Lord thinking about what was
[1:52:37] going to have today amen and so I'm
[1:52:40] going to have a little appetite after a
[1:52:41] while right but you know what in there
[1:52:44] when you eat together oh wow that's
[1:52:47] having real Fellowship you sat down
[1:52:48] across the table or next door you know
[1:52:51] somebody here rub shoulders with
[1:52:52] somebody and enjoy a good meal right
[1:52:56] amen refreshing something satisfying
[1:52:58] take away your hunger
[1:53:00] well then after the kitchen you know
[1:53:03] you're going to kind of retire a little
[1:53:05] bit toward the Parlor I think he said
[1:53:06] you know and you get a little bit more
[1:53:08] closer relationship like a a man that
[1:53:11] was taking his wife into her new house
[1:53:15] and that's good to have Fellowship
[1:53:21] then he said there's where you have
[1:53:24] relationships right amen and just
[1:53:27] Fellowship is not sufficient but
[1:53:30] Fellowship is necessary to bring us to
[1:53:32] what is sufficient amen relationship
[1:53:35] amen so my subject tonight again
[1:53:38] Fellowship on two relationships amen
[1:53:42] amen and the importance and the purpose
[1:53:44] of Fellowship amen
[1:53:47] now Jesus spoke of the fellowship that
[1:53:50] he opened his
[1:53:51] the foundation of the world all right
[1:53:53] remember that
[1:53:55] right amen oh my what was it God and his
[1:54:00] fault God and His attributes
[1:54:04] amen my God and His GPS's
[1:54:09] he's getting it all coordinated wasn't
[1:54:11] it ain't no messing up for that man's
[1:54:15] satellites might not always this storm
[1:54:17] might mess it up you know right you
[1:54:19] might not get the signal from the
[1:54:21] satellite but oh I'll tell you what
[1:54:22] Jonah and the belly of the whale in the
[1:54:25] bottom of the sea still got a signal
[1:54:29] Jerusalem you know there was a sacrifice
[1:54:32] over there and he had met God's
[1:54:34] requirement once again while I turn oh
[1:54:37] he knew Solomon had prayed and dedicated
[1:54:39] the temple amen that GPS worked yes
[1:54:55] sir man amen
[1:55:00] when man didn't have enough Intuition or
[1:55:04] sense or Godly drawing why they get
[1:55:07] rejected the message that's right
[1:55:10] same thing comes again today is that
[1:55:13] right yeah amen yes
[1:55:16] fellowship before the foundation of the
[1:55:18] world now
[1:55:20] if Christ had fellowship with us
[1:55:24] okay and the scripture plainly declares
[1:55:27] he hath predestinated us together with
[1:55:29] Christ
[1:55:31] before the foundation then that makes
[1:55:34] you just as predestinated as Christ is
[1:55:36] amen that's right and the same you love
[1:55:38] Christ but if he loves you with the same
[1:55:41] love right
[1:55:42] right sir yes then you can no more fail
[1:55:45] that Christ can fail all right amen and
[1:55:49] God desires your fellowship
[1:55:51] right there just as much as he deserved
[1:55:54] The Fellowship of Christ yeah amen
[1:55:57] in fact the prophet put it like this
[1:56:01] when Jesus was praying in Saint John 17
[1:56:03] the only thing he asked for for himself
[1:56:06] was for your fellowship yes
[1:56:11] which seems selfish huh
[1:56:14] or something for himself but God is
[1:56:16] totally unselfish that's right man he's
[1:56:18] totally unselfish but he did ask for
[1:56:21] your fellowship that's where I am there
[1:56:24] they may be also
[1:56:38] what do you like
[1:56:39] when the word of God is made manifest
[1:56:42] that was the prophet's definition of
[1:56:44] Life
[1:56:45] your name if we walk in the light as
[1:56:48] he's in the night light not Methodist
[1:56:50] light yeah Luther Knight
[1:56:53] not Pentecost
[1:56:56] flights
[1:57:02] we'll walk we'll walk walk in the light
[1:57:06] is that right sure amen such a beautiful
[1:57:08] light shines where the Dew drops of
[1:57:10] Mercy are bright called fellowshipping
[1:57:12] with his attributes but you know what
[1:57:16] that was not perfect Fellowship God
[1:57:18] wasn't satisfied just with that
[1:57:20] Fellowship that we had before the
[1:57:22] foundation where amen he wasn't
[1:57:24] satisfied with that right
[1:57:26] ah
[1:57:28] do you know what worship was not
[1:57:32] perfected
[1:57:33] the Angels
[1:57:36] if God was satisfied with the fellowship
[1:57:39] and worship of the Angels he'd never
[1:57:41] made you
[1:57:42] amen
[1:57:44] amen your worship is more desired than
[1:57:48] the angels are
[1:58:07] God was talking about Mary nursing the
[1:58:10] word yes bringing it to maturity the
[1:58:14] word was a thought expressed in the mind
[1:58:15] of God first and then it was spoken yeah
[1:58:18] amen Elohim become gave birth to himself
[1:58:22] that's right all that was in there with
[1:58:24] him he poured into Christ
[1:58:26] God Elohim giving birth to himself yes
[1:58:30] oh oh my God here he comes look oh gosh
[1:58:34] coming forth
[1:58:37] ah no no
[1:58:38] more but all that was in God Amen not
[1:58:42] part of what was in God
[1:58:47] oh that was in God he poured into Christ
[1:58:51] here comes
[1:58:54] right fellowship and with Abraham on the
[1:58:57] plates of memory yes amen having
[1:59:00] communion with Abraham down there he's
[1:59:01] you know right
[1:59:04] that's right and coming on down it
[1:59:07] became Jesus Christ what was it God
[1:59:11] coming on down yes condescending
[1:59:14] Fellowship amen right amen hallelujah
[1:59:18] Fellowship yes sir amen come on down God
[1:59:23] condescending he could never think in
[1:59:26] terms of my sinning he's already the
[1:59:28] highest that's right eternity to
[1:59:30] Eternity but you can only think in terms
[1:59:33] of condescending materializing yes the
[1:59:36] program and Plan of Redemption is
[1:59:38] Jehovah God or Elohim materializing
[1:59:41] himself
[1:59:46] thank you
[1:59:47] oh brother
[1:59:49] coming on down coming on down but you
[1:59:52] know what then he let these attribute
[1:59:54] seeds right right bypass their theophany
[1:59:57] come on down for they can be tempted
[1:59:59] right and that's the difference between
[2:00:00] Christ and you've seen yeah oh my God he
[2:00:04] became see that melchized dick in that
[2:00:07] word form body and so forth in theophany
[2:00:09] form uh in morphia see it just got
[2:00:12] changing his mask he's doing all things
[2:00:15] that's right amen but you know what when
[2:00:17] he came down on Earth and took on the
[2:00:19] form of Flesh he didn't necessarily know
[2:00:20] all things that's right it was God
[2:00:22] limiting himself in a man

[2:05:17] humility right amen
[2:05:20] now here was Jesus having fellowship
[2:05:22] with his disciples that was wonderful
[2:05:25] and he didn't want to leave them he left
[2:05:27] them to the end but they knew he had
[2:05:29] another thing coming that was going to
[2:05:31] be greater and he said he who is that
[2:05:33] with you shall be in you amen amen this
[2:05:38] Fellowship is going to get good

[2:06:42] he knows what's good for us amen amen
[2:06:49] Fellowship on a higher order
[2:06:52] then the disciples had fellowship with
[2:06:54] one another on the day of Pentecost like
[2:06:55] they've never known before they had
[2:06:58] Unity do you know brother Ben said the
[2:07:01] disciples did not
[2:07:02] one another or even with Christ while he
[2:07:06] was here with him on the Earth
[2:07:10] you say but my Bible
[2:07:14] School of Theology and Theology and
[2:07:16] Jesus himself was a teacher for three
[2:07:18] and a half years that's good that's true
[2:07:19] that's wonderful that's right
[2:07:21] but he said also the prophet of God
[2:07:24] and it brings your profit he said this
[2:07:26] for a reason he said Jesus and his
[2:07:28] disciples had no fellowship or unities
[2:07:32] where do you excuse me
[2:07:34] I'm kind of Italian Fellowship you
[2:07:36] understand for the sake of emphasize
[2:07:39] they didn't have that True Fellowship
[2:07:41] didn't have that true Unity right
[2:07:45] right
[2:07:47] see there's a True Fellowship
[2:07:50] amen
[2:07:52] not true in contrasting with false okay
[2:07:55] but
[2:07:56] ah full Revelation yes and full
[2:07:59] Fellowship as contrasted with partial
[2:08:01] Fellowship that's right oh my God

[2:08:11] him that wasn't all there was to it at

[2:14:37] for the second Adam a bride right for
[2:14:41] the Tree of Life Christ
[2:14:43] and so Satan didn't like that and the
[2:14:46] first thing he done was destroy the

[2:15:05] stripped it yeah all right the next
[2:15:07] tender part of the tree was the leaves
[2:15:11] brother Graham said that was Fellowship
[2:15:14] the devil knows the power of Fellowship

[2:19:08] reveal word is your husband is that what
[2:19:10] we're taught yeah amen
[2:19:13] gotta kind of try to condense this and
[2:19:15] bring it down to a close cause I don't
[2:19:16] want to take advantage of you seven
[2:19:19] instead leading up
[2:19:20] pyramid to the
[2:19:22] or he called it so the king's chamber
[2:19:25] and on the seventh step is where the
[2:19:27] introducer comes forth to introduce the
[2:19:29] comer unto The King and I want to ask
[2:19:32] the question today in your relationship
[2:19:34] or your fellowship with Christ under the
[2:19:37] blood
[2:19:39] where are you at are you just on the
[2:19:41] seventh step or are you in the king's
[2:19:44] chamber yes are you just in a fellowship
[2:19:48] standing on the front porch and
[2:19:50] fellowship out there on the steps you
[2:19:52] know that's right yeah or are you in a
[2:19:55] relationship yes in the king's chamber
[2:19:58] there has to be a relationship
[2:20:02] and when that relationship comes
[2:20:06] this relationship I'm talking about
[2:20:09] where your soul is sealed in with God
[2:20:11] eternity behind the veil where the glory
[2:20:13] never fails
[2:20:15] brother the womb of the soul is sealed
[2:20:19] closed
[2:20:21] and no other seed can conceive or take
[2:20:23] place from then on and the prophet of
[2:20:26] God taught us that this little bride is
[2:20:28] already called
[2:20:29] amen he said was already married to
[2:20:32] Christ and he also said she's pregnant
[2:20:35] that's right
[2:20:37] yes
[2:20:42] what a relationship not just a

[2:21:37] from the king's Fellowship that's right
[2:21:39] but Esther was chosen right yeah now
[2:21:42] there was 127th of them in fellowship
[2:21:44] with the king oh yeah
[2:21:47] I'm trying to tell you now that
[2:21:49] Fellowship alone is not sufficient amen
[2:21:52] amen have I got your attention amen
[2:21:55] Fellowship alone is not sufficient oh
[2:21:58] it's wonderful we gotta have it and it's
[2:22:00] necessary to have the right kind of
[2:22:02] Fellowship yes right right but there's
[2:22:04] something more yes
[2:22:07] 127 women had fellowship with the King
[2:22:11] they went in one night with the king oh
[2:22:14] what a text that being one night with a
[2:22:16] king uh-huh
[2:22:18] and then they went out and they went to
[2:22:19] the house of the concubines
[2:22:22] and they return no more to the house of
[2:22:24] the king except
[2:22:27] the king had pleasure in them delighted
[2:22:31] in them and remembered their name and
[2:22:33] call them body
[2:22:35] amen amen the Mysteries are called in
[2:22:40] the names of the elect yes
[2:22:48] a death
[2:22:49] Mr
[2:22:50] she got a name change from something
[2:22:53] Earthly you know a murder tree a little
[2:22:55] Evergreen Bush to a star shooting star
[2:22:58] yes amen and she was called not just to
[2:23:03] a fellowship just called to relationship
[2:23:07] amen this bride must be in this hour
[2:23:11] that's right amen come out of the
[2:23:13] fellowship on up into the relationship
[2:23:15] does that do away with Fellowship no it
[2:23:18] just gets greater
[2:23:19] yes it is that right sure
[2:23:23] seven steps leading up to the king's
[2:23:26] chamber there is where
[2:23:28] the invisible Union has taken place for
[2:23:32] the for real true seed of God it is
[2:23:35] taking place and that blood will never
[2:23:37] lose its power till that last one comes
[2:23:39] in is that right sure he's still
[2:23:42] interceding until that last one comes in
[2:23:45] has to be there sure
[2:23:48] amen amen
[2:23:50] only for the elect of course only the
[2:23:52] elected are considered in this
[2:23:54] Redemption now where are you in your
[2:23:56] fellowship with God
[2:23:58] see that's the question you ask yourself
[2:24:02] are you really spiritually impregnated
[2:24:05] with the very Life of Christ and your
[2:24:07] womb sealed bringing forth Christ
[2:24:10] the word to full maturity in your life
[2:24:12] to the Statue of fullness of Jesus
[2:24:15] Christ the perfect man or or you maybe
[2:24:18] stagnated yeah there's a lot of
[2:24:21] difference between being pregnated and
[2:24:22] stagnated
[2:24:24] now the womb must be sealed no other
[2:24:26] seed can hold or take hold once you come
[2:24:30] into that King's chamber into that
[2:24:32] relationship
[2:24:33] now
[2:24:36] I'm just gonna close
[2:24:38] but I didn't really plan this but since
[2:24:40] they brought my briefcase up here
[2:24:42] I'm reminded
[2:24:45] of the pilot
[2:24:47] you know and the pilate's wife
[2:24:52] and I take what I better do
[2:24:55] maybe I'll just I didn't even read it a
[2:24:57] lot of these scriptures or quotes but

[2:41:30] and maybe but you know if that
[2:41:33] predestinated seed is in you in there I
[2:41:36] pulled you right here as a deep crawling
[2:41:39] to the Deep if there's any call in your
[2:41:42] heart hotter than there's something has
[2:41:45] to satisfy that hunger there has to be a
[2:41:47] need to respond what is it God wanting

[2:42:46] minister of the gospel for some 43 years
[2:42:49] that you don't have to come and try to
[2:42:51] correct anybody
[2:42:53] you just preach the word the word will
[2:42:55] correct the era and the Holy Spirit will
[2:42:58] deal with hearts if you love The People
[2:43:00] yes I wonder in the little message this
[2:43:05] afternoon the Lord laid on my heart this
[2:43:07] morning Ben
[2:43:09] get up say it brother Hughes I'm ashamed
[2:43:12] that I'm not in a greater fellowship and
[2:43:15] relationship with Christ I've been too
[2:43:17] busy with too many other things I've
[2:43:20] yet been with brothers and sisters
[2:43:23] maybe but what about my fellowship with
[2:43:25] Christ and you're ashamed you've been
[2:43:29] too busy
[2:43:30] you know God wants fellowship with you
[2:43:35] slip your hands to him now not to me
[2:43:37] slip your hand up to him if you feel a
[2:43:40] little bit ashamed that you haven't
[2:43:41] spent a little more time with you God
[2:43:44] bless my all over the church yes pray
