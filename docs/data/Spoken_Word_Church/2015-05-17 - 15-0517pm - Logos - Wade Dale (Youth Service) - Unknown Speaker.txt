quick here and uh try to get finished in a couple hours so let's buy our heads the heavenly father we pray Lord today that you would not be a bystander of this service but be the active participant Lord you be the one that does the speaking father you be the one that does the hearing and you the only one that can do the revealing so father as the word Goes Forth we pray that you just reveal

need Lord save our lost loved ones and be with us now as we talk about you just settle us now Lord and take care of us take everything away from us that doesn't uh pertain to you Lord that may hinder the service just you take over and have preeminence in Jesus name amen all right let's go to John 1 and then I'll let you be seated and then I want to give you just a little short testimony in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him who the word right all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made okay I I really like what brother dick uh his view of the Creator because you can say God mean many things but there's only one guy that can create amen amen that's the almighty Satan can't Satan can be called God he can be worshiped as God but you can't have a Creator only one you can only have one Creator and that's that's the uh that's the almighty in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not you may be seated in the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of his word we're going to U um try to bring something a little unusual or the ones in the Sunday school class they uh they know where I'm going because we've been studying on this and if any of you would like to attend or either watch online we're doing a um uh a subject called the three sons names remember God comes in three son's name comes in the Son of God the son of man son of David and in all that is a lot of things but to understand those three you must understand those dispensations because to be in if everybody says well we're in the son of man dispensation okay what is it Son of God dispensation what is it all right so that's where that we're going to look at today and bring something maybe a little bit different than what you thought before but you know when you say the word logos that just kind of blows your brain because you like that's for the scholars and that's for you know and we've had all these explanations but today I'd like to maybe bring it down to where it's very very simple what the logos is not what it was what it is but just for a moment for Testimony I want to tell you a little something comical that happened the other day that uh I told the ones downstairs so I'll tell you up here I was U cutting grass in Gillsville and and uh they've got a place there that I don't know why it's there but it's full of mud and I was a little bit behind so I kind of got a little bit close to the edge and went off in the hole well make a long story short I got stuck so I got stuck and I couldn't get out so I'm and as I'm trying to get out I'm almost out you know and I said well thank you Lord you know I'm you know I'm behind and I need to get this done and I'm you know I'm I can be on schedule if I get this done and then I knew that if I got stuck with those kind of lawnmowers you can't one person can't get them out because with a hydrostat transmission somebody's got to be driving it when somebody's pulling it or you're just going to be dragging dead weight so it has to take two people so I was the only one there and U so I'm almost out brother dick and I get almost out of that mud hole and it went I mean it stopped I had already dug such a rut till when it got to dry ground it had made such a rut it stopped couldn't get out back and forth and I you know I was kind of having a pity party I said Lord you know you've helped me do this and you've helped me do that can you not help me get out of this you know and I was you know and I wasn't blaming the Lord I was blaming me but I was wanting him to help me sister Anna you know I needed some help so I you know I so I get my cell phone out and I'm walking back to the truck and I'm mumbling and muttering to myself you know and I get on the cell phone and I call Daddy ring ring ring no answer I call the house ring ring ring no answer so I call and I get terance it was a day that ended in why so he was playing golf so he was in Gainesville he said well I'll try to find Zach of course by that time um man pulled up an older gentleman he said you need some help buddy I said yeah I believe I do he said well get in here he said I pull that other guy out of that hole couple years couple years ago that was the guy that did it before me so I didn't feel so dumb so so he said I'll help you come get out of that so he you know I get in the car with him and and it wasn't too far it was 2 300 yards and so I turn around you know and he I get in the car with him we go we hook it up well his son pulls up he said son says son says hey I got a rope so we'll just pull you out right here so in other words two minutes later I was out and going about my work well they drove off they I said I owe you anything they said no you don't owe me nothing don't worry about it so going down the road well I got from here to that door I'm like man Brother Richard I saved like 30 minutes cuz that's why I have to go find somebody to come get me out so I saved about 30 minutes or 45 so I got about from here to that door and something came on me and said what have you been preaching because usually when not not here but most of the time in other services I bring in the cup of water in my name uh sermon that you seem very insignificant but if a if a man changed your tire and I got to thinking I thought H and I said well Lord I'm sorry he said you know what he said if I have got you out you wouldn't have to called your daddy he said if your daddy had got you out wouldn't had to call your brother if your brother would have got you out that man would have never had a chance that man would have never had a chance and he said now that man has a chance at the white Throne judgment he has a chance to be given eternal life for helping me and I thought I was crying like a baby in all my pity party think about it though think about your problem though and your situations life that you come up to a place and you go why did that happen it wasn't for you it was for someone else but you it had to come through you because just you know some common person helping some common person they just help each other that's just good but when you help a child of God that's right he said I'll not forget it here or not forget it then so I just believe the man and his son will be blessed here and the be blessed in glory but if I'd have been able to get in touch with with Dad he'd have come pull me out you that's what was coming to me and I don't know if God speaks to you but he speaks to me in my voice right right I I've not heard but one time an audible voice that didn't sound like me talking to me hello it's me usually talking to me is who it is but through that God used that and said if he would have been here you would have had you wouldn't that man would have never had a chance and I thought Lord I'll never argue I'll never complain about a situation again that comes up that I think that I have a problem so you just thank God that he's G us a revelation you think God you talking about brother Dale this morning talking about a child of God now look to me that to me that's just an experience that helps me but it does show me that I am a child of God that God thought enough of me to stop me and say look buddy you see what you see what just happened all right and then you go into that situation so uh if anything happens like that to you start looking around if you're a child of God then it must be something that God has because remember God doesn't do anything haphazard he has already got this thing planned out he already knew what was going to happen then because see and I was texting Dad and Mom that night because I asked him I said did you not get my phone call he said no I didn't get my phone call and he picked his phone up and he said yeah you called at 147 right and he said well mom was at home why didn't she answer the phone mama said I don't know we were busy I wasn't answering the phone you know so I mean you see how God worked all that out to when I looked at Daddy's phone I knew you know I said well that's why cuz his phone said I called him at 147 he said no you didn't call me I said yeah I did I tried to call you so in situations like that God saw before the foundation of the world that all that that was going to work together and that that man could have an opportunity to receive eternal life just for helping a child of God so say so don't don't miss those opportunities when we're having py parties remember one thing you might be having that pity party and somebody else may be receiving eternal life so what better I mean you can't put money on that you can't put money or you can't put anything on that but what happened right there in that little 5 minute length of time is worth an eternity amen so but hey we got we are the children of God we get the benefits and the people around us get the benefits right cuz you know brother Brown said the United States is doomed and and and you know ready for Destruction but we what we're friends of Israel so God has blessed us from being for being the friends of Israel of course we know why the bombs are not falling on us now because you and I are here all right so let's go into this and let's look at this first form and let's go to the first back to John 1:1 it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God now that word word in the Greek lexican is logos okay that word logos now you can go to to the explanation of logos because we've had many things that that have that have come about that it's it's were it's speech and and all this and we're going to develop into something here and see what um see what the Lord has for us I know we've been enjoying it down in the Sunday school class and um and we may have brought something that may help you understand that word logos but it's it has to do with a word it's uttered by a living voice amen and like brother Dale was talking about uh the Lord had showed him some things about that and it is the only way you can speak is to have air right when you're speaking speaking like I'm speaking now I have to use air that comes out of my lungs goes over my vocal cords and it has to speak well see now I can understand where brother brandom says now before this he said there was nothing yeah he said there was no air there was no molecule there was no anything and then this person comes forth and says Let There be when that person says Let There Be there's got to be some air there's got to be something that has developed and listen before we get started into this real good remember one thing this is not for God's benefit this is for our benefit to be able to understand a God that we were talking about it downstairs you you you got to keep just keep going back and keep going back how are you going to understand Eternal you and I have a beginning and we're looking toward an end we have time and we have all these things but you know God before the foundation of the world he knew what this man in India right now is thinking what day he was born what he thought every day and what day he would die every person in the that's ever been born since the beginning of time God knew their thoughts before it ever started now how can you understand that I can't understand it and how can he be standing right here today and be in the next church or how can he be over in India or be over in Africa how can be he be there he's ever present you and I are not ever present amen so God has to bring a way though that shows us who he is cuz we must understand God right amen amen we must understand God why because God is doing something for us we got just like me and that lawnmower I had a human moment right I had a human moment that wasn't a supernatural moment it was but I didn't know it till afterwards how many times brother Brown tell you I'll be in the vision and not even know it remember he was in that Vision that uh when he killed the bear and all that he was in that vision and didn't even know it all right till it sometimes till it was over so in our Humanity sometimes we forget that there is a little bit of Supernatural somewhere that God is using that you may not see it till after it's over with all right so same way with God to as God condescends there's no way that we can understand God so he has to put it in a form that we can understand right he has to put it in a form he has to put it in something so you and I can understand roll it up a little bit it's a decree a mandate or an order of the moral precepts given by God so we know and it's a a discourse the act of speaking or speech The Faculty of speech skill and practice and speaking now to be able to describe something you either got to have it written down or you you got to speak it all right there's got to be something in in us that's visual as human beings remember us not God all right so it's reason the mental faculty of thinking meditating reasoning calculating so remember God before the foundation of the world he doesn't make any mistakes right he makes no um missteps he has no uh he has no surprise he has no uh fear what he says is going to come to pass that's right so we must go back excuse me and look into the mind of God because that's where it all begins from all right now how can you do that you can do that by the Holy Ghost right because that is the mind of God Amen so that's why the brother R said what the new birth was the most important thing you could have because that is the creator living inside of you so what whatever he did in the beginning you will be able to understand that if you have the Holy Ghost and yield yourself to him I said if that's a big word if you yield yourself to him so we see this logos was the was God coming into a form but let's read quote number a and let's bring it from the mind of God the word become flesh and India trip God in the beginning back there when he seen the world he seen you and I here this morning he seen you and I here this morning he seen my babysitting back Yonder he seen every hungry person in India see how we can't comprehend that I mean how can you you could sit there and go crazy comprehending that this man knew this before he ever was here all right but we're getting ready to understand him if you'll hang on just a minute he seen every hungry person in India he seen every preacher in the pull pit he seen every hypocrite walking he seen the whole thing the infinite Mind Of God foresaw it and he said now to redeem that Fallen race I will send forth my son Christ Jesus there was the word in the beginning before it was a word now watch this you got to read this right or you'll make him say something he's not saying because in the beginning before it was a word it was a thought right before it was a thought yeah now don't you can't say before it was a thought cuz it wasn't word it was a thought first see before comma it was a thought it was expressed in a word amen and the word became material and dwelt Among Us so does everybody understand that it was a thought the thought of God is eternal and that those thoughts had to be expressed for us to be able to understand him because actually you and I were a part of that thought let's go to the next quote this is the proof of his res Resurrection 1955 I told him down in Sunday school class and I'm going to tell you does it matter what year he said it does it matter what sermon he said it in we don't even have to read these okay everybody's hung on well it's got to be before forget it don't even worry I'm not I don't even read those anymore it doesn't matter he said it and we believe it and we we're trying to understand it now keep going though the word speaks it his mind can't comprehend it talking about us because it's a human mind he's got to have the mind of God in him to understand Godly things see so all the reading all the schools all the teaching as good as they may be yet that's not the real principle yet all right so go to the next one keep going that's a continuation just there you go now look before he ever put the printed word and this is the mind of God now I'm I'm saying he's holding up this right is that okay is that a is that a good interpretation is that all right he was holding up this right and this is the mind of God cuz he print printed word all right here it is this is a mind of God that he thought before the foundation of the world was ever laid it is it's the reason he could put it on printed word and say what he would be because he saw it before the foundation of the world and knew just what it would be and spoke it out all right so this word is eternal amen Heaven and Earth will pass away but this word will never pass away because this is to me this is the mind of God this is what he thought this is his thoughts expressed in words so that you and me can understand it and for an eternity we still be in this amen all right let's go to the next one real quick I want to just set a little stage here where was Jesus slain at at Calvary no no sir Jesus was slain before the foundation of the world Behold the Lamb of God that was slain before the foundation of the world God in the beginning when he saw the sin he saw what would happened he spoke the word and Jesus was slain before the foundation of the world and every person was saved was saved according to the Bible when the lamb was slain in the mind of God before the foundation of the world you were included in Salvation then so what are you going to do about it brother Bob this morning was talking about fear if you can get a revelation that that has come to you and it has to come by process of the new birth not just that you just saw it and they just believed it no process of the New Birth by the process of the new birth which was that God did see you before the foundation world see that's why many people don't understand what brother brandham said right brother brandham is bringing it straight from the mind of God down to you but then he's got to he's got to bring certain things to the human to the human part of you you weren't Burnal a certain day you always was eternal you need eternal life you're dead and you're lost now how you put those two together he's talking to the human man amen because in the mind of God if you were saved you were saved then but you didn't know it we'll read this later on all right so everybody understand that before the foundation of the world Jesus was slain that's how Adam could get by with what he got by with right amen all right let's go next one keep going up cuz this is this is this is a long read from the church age book so this is going to sum part of it up in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally now when he when brother Brown talks about us being Eternal that's what it is right right the mind of God because the mind of God is eternal all right though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decree season you come to the altar you go through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost you receive the Life of Christ that was always with him before the foundation of the world he knew what day you were going to get it right very simple you didn't come here with it no you can come here with it you came here lost he came here with it right and then you have to accept it if the spirit of him that dwells in you I love that word if it's a big word as each member came forth it became what expressed so you had to you had to express it's like brother Dale was talking about this morning the only way for you to know that you got the new birth is you express right you express what's inside of you whether you're lost or or or or born again because you're an expression all right of one of the other the devil or or or or God came forth became expressed and took its place in the body so each of us have a place in the body thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride so there must to be what something spoken not something from the loins of Man by sex and though she is feminine in designation she is also called the body of Christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same Source was eternal with him what the part of the eternal life all right came from the same Source was eternal with him and is now manifesting God in a many membered body whereas once God was manifested in one member right even our Lord Jesus Christ now why I've always asked I've always asked the people that says that you know you always was eternal and all these things why wasn't the disciples they were standing there with him and even like brother Dale said he breathed on them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost now buddy that would have been that was the word himself right why couldn't they get it he hadn't died yet to release the life he was held by what the word or they would have received eternal life right there same way with you and I there's got to come a place and a time sure sure sure people sure kids God knows the day you're going to accept him but it's because he knew you would accept he had it ready for you and where did he have it ready for you in the word he had it ready for you your part to play it is in this word right here amen you got to find it though but your place is here that's why the word had to be swn in here for him to come and Quicken it it's the part that you needed that's right you know why God wrote this for you and me he wrote this for you and me for us to be able to come forth a s went forth to s the word right amen everybody all right you sleepy wedes say Amen wake up always gift the Sleepy Crowd Oh by the way brother Danny stand up stand up for a second what you got on that looks pretty good man it's catching on catching on I'll have some Baron Brothers around here for long I like it though I don't have to go but listen also pray for me I'm going to Jamaica in July the 8th and do a youth camp so pray for me July the 8th through the 13th so just keep me in your prayers that'll be kind of different for me to do but I think I might be able to act like one and not act right ah funny funny funny funny all right so explaining this logos or this part of God that brother Brown said went out from God not like an arm going off so the children can understand remember one thing like I said before God never changes he has never changed since the beginning of time right or he's not God so he hasn't changed he's the same person with the same attributes with the same manifestations he's the same man all right he's never changed so whatever he speaks that man can you not have some confidence if you knew brother Mark everything you spoke come to pass what kind of confidence would that be well you know what what's the an adopted son of God supposed to do sir hello what's an adopted God supposed to do the mind of God come right through the lips of man same thing we're living way below our privileges all right so let's look at this logos and let's and we know cuz I want to stay back cuz we know that logos is the Angel of the Covenant it what you see him down through the Old Testament when you see that even in John 1 that he says and the Word was made flesh so we know that logos became flesh amen so we can follow him down but let's keep him back and see what's going on this coming from the mind of God because remember coming from the mind of God there has to something literally come out exactly cuz remember he was slain before the foundation of the world but he was literally slain down here on the Earth right right he he could have stayed up there and been slain in the mind of God it wouldn't have done us any good he had to take on human flesh had to come down here and literally die to release the life to go back to where we come from amen all right so let's read quote number one now I want you now we're going to start and we're going to talk about this person called logos because it's not a different person children it's not something another man standing beside God as far as a different personality it's the same person he's just what revealing himself or making himself known to our finite mind all right so let's read this 1950 and we're taught in the beginning that the logos are the Son of God one out of God now so now the logos has picked up a title that's where we go where we're doing what we're doing downstairs is three sons names Son of God Son of Man son of David all right and we know he comes back as son of man in the end time right now but let's try to get get the other part together first now look and I want to settle this for you too because a lot of people when we were talking about the River Jordan they they bring this quote up now I do not believe in Eternal sunship now Eternal sunship according to the Catholics is that God had a son three people go father son Holy Ghost there's no way to have an eternal sunship right he said that's just not natural look he said that's even radical to even mention such a thing Eternal sunship he had an eternal sunship you say brother wait he's already said he's the son of God that's Eternal God the same person the Catholics and everybody else is bringing Eternal sunship in as another person everybody understand that that's why brother R didn't believe in Eternal sunship in that form but he did look he'll never lose this title a Son of God right right God doesn't gain them and then lose them he gains he doesn't gain them or lose them he just is what he is right all right so he's the son of God something that you and I can understand and if you want to call it a lower form of God brother random does one time it's a lower form of God for us to be able to understand him but not to be God and then he had a son that's okay so that's Eternal sunship there's no way that can be Eternal that's why you can't have three gods co-equal co- Eternal that's not sensible one God with many manifestations all right so he first was god Jehovah and out of him let's just picture now little drama so you can get it let's see coming out of space where there's nothing let's make it a little white light like a Mystic light like a Halo and that was the logos that went out of God in the beginning that was the son of God that came out of the bosom of the father that was what was in the beginning was what the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God that's why you go back to John 1 that word translated is logos so in the beginning was the logos the logos was with God and the logos was God all right and then to to denote where he was he was in the beginning with God all right so now and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us so we know in the beginning was God and then out of God came the logos part of God that went out of god so let's go to the next quote we're going to read a few of these and then we'll get into what we're talking about now look and I want you to not get caught up because brother R uses this many times he said God covers all space Time and Eternity and he's this big light now look if God was a light and he began as a light you and I have to be a light right cuz he said let us make man in our image okay so God's always been a man okay like brother Dale said Moses met God in the burning bush but now all Moses Revelation was was a burning bush behind that burning bush had Moses saw a higher Revelation he would have seen a man standing there called Jesus Christ because that's what he saw when he walked past him and he said God I want to see you amen so it's so it's you know he said you can't see God you know the Bible says you can't God not you can't see God now why is that word see understand you got to translate that word to understand CU yeah we do see God it's Jesus Christ he said if you've seen me you've seen the father okay but the Bible says no man has seen God at any time okay nobody's understood God at any time but we're getting ready to understand him by this revealing or this unfolding of God but now watch what he says and then after he got all this creation made he said let us plural make man in our plural own image now now if God is unseen if the logos was in the form just mythically speaking all right so he's bringing this light in right and inside this light is a person don't wa and explain it cuz God wasn't a light and then he became a person we watched somebody do that one time on a video he brings this big pulsating light and then it drops down into an empty human form no God always was a human form he's just showing himself that you can't understand this big great light is that all right amen because remember he appeared over brother random in 1950 in the form of what a pillar of fire brother R said that was Jesus Christ amen the revelation of the camera was the Halo of light brother Brown knew who it was Paul same thing on the road to Damascus he saw a great light he says my Lord what he had a revelation but like brother Dale said everybody kind of puts that on Paul as his new birth he had to go visit anas and an I had to lay hands on him to receive the Holy Ghost right so it was something that was leading Paul to that experience but it wasn't the experience of the new birth because the life has to come through the body he couldn't receive listen have you ever thought about this he could why didn't Jesus just give him eternal life if he was already a seed of God and he had a seat why didn't God just say you're born again you you don't have to go nowhere no he said you get up and you go into that City and he's going to be a man named ananas he's going to meet you there pray for you that you get the Holy Ghost now why didn't God just give him the Holy Ghost brother call on the day on the road to Damascus why don't you just give it to him right then can't go past his word Seed Life must come through the body all right and who ananas was the body that that Paul had to receive the holy ghost from all right just mythically speaking drama so he's dramatizing right in the form of a Halo then it's supernatural then he had to make a man in his own image John 4 says that God is a spirit and he had to make a spirit man and he brought it down now there their's deity cannot be seen deity is the supernatural then he brings it down from a sacred Halo to a little white cloud something that's more visible that's man now man's not a cloud that's right man's not a cloud man's a man all right he gave him the rulership over the kingdom and he governed the Beast like the Holy Spirit leads the church today all right continue on cuz we know see then that logos began to speak and said let there be light and all those other things go to the next so then when God made his first man he was a spirit man all right so now he's bringing in Genesis 1:26 he was something in the order of God or the Son of God the logos now remember Adam if you go over in the Book of Luke in the in the genealogy of God what was Adam the last one Adam was a Son of God all right so Adam was a Son of God why because he had this logos in him amen amen he had this logos in Adam that's what God put in Adam the eternal life that God put in Adam was logos right amen now if we were look watch this right here that was the first man then he gave the man jurisdiction to lead the animal life just like the Holy Spirit leads the believer today go here do this roll scroll it up just a little bit brother M now if we were perfect in submission to the Holy Spirit God would lead us by the Holy Spirit just like Adam led the animals of that day Glory hello you read that I want you to read that while I take a drink now if we were perfect in submission to the Holy Spirit God would lead us by the Holy Spirit just like Adam L the animals of that day so the logos was the form of God to speak is that all right say amen amen amen that was the part of God that began to speak because look God thought it then he spoke it right and what he spoke had to come to pass because he's God he's the Creator I've always said the Bible even says Heaven and Earth will pass away but what does that mean brother bandam comes over into the future home and he says you look at that word pass away he said we think as in denominational terms that this world's going to be annihilated and God's going to bring a new one or we're going to heaven no when God made the sun it's been shining ever since he said let there be I believe those six days of creation that was an eternal creation Satan just came down and blackened or marred that for a time cuz this Earth is eternal a't it going to be brother Bram said only the sin is going to be knocked off of it right God's not going to annihilate something he's already created cuz he created it perfect so let's go to the next one now look all this talking about logos I was looking the other day and this is where the whole thought came from to understand that word logos which means speech word in other words description have you ever heard of the word logo yeah a symbol that is used to identify a company and that appears on its product add an S to that and you got the logos but that word logo comes from that it's in the same family of words so what is the logos the logos is a description of God how many of you been driving down the road and seen this right here turn go ahead first one I'll show you how God so simple it is what's the first thing you thought of hamburgers french fries right that's a logo right and that logo has progressed this was in 1953 this is the first one but as they progressed more and more and began to promote or to describe what their company was like now all you got to do is drive down the road and the kid's 3 years old goes hamburger well that don't say McDonald's does it does that say Hamburger does that say french fries soft drinks but in your brain what are you doing in your brain you're develop they have developed their logo to such a part to where you understand almost all of this but look that's only a m that's only a go we call it the golden arches that's a logo of the company but everything of that company is behind that same way with God when the logos come out it was God representing or I I you know I don't think God's going to going to cringe when I say this cuz he knew I was going to say it for the foundation of the world it's like a poster child the logos is a poster child he's one that steps forward and says this is what I'm all about you know you get a spokesperson we're not going to bring Ronald McDonald into this but he's the spokesperson if you see Ronald McDonald on the street you know that behind him is a company call McDonald's and they have employees and they have this and and you can go back even to the Salt and Pepper that they use you see what I'm talking about same way with God when the logos comes out he wants you to understand that's the logo of who he is all right same thing pull up the next one see each one of these companies have come this was 1978 that's kind of bland isn't it but now this is 2012 we know when you think of Microsoft what do you think of Bill Gates billionaire computers phones you know same thing with apple you see the logo and the logo is the representative of what's behind it now this is only one word that says Microsoft but you could sit down all day and you could give all the divisions and all the money and all the things they buy and all the things they produce and it'll take you forever listen it's the same way with God if he was to sit down and explain the logos you couldn't put it in this book right here right but but with the mind of God knowing what his logo is by the Holy Ghost your your human brain Redeemer healer savior Jehovah Mighty God Prince of Peace you can keep going all day long and through an eternity but that to so to understand a logo the logos it's the logo of God it's what God is McDonald's with that golden arches like I said it didn't say a word about hamburgers but that's the first thing come in your mind so the same thing with logos if you hear anybody talk about the logos that came out of God it's not a separate person it's God trying to express himself to me and you in the most simple terms because see I can can look at that logo and in very simple terms I can say I got one of those you know I don't understand how the thing works but Microsoft does I don't understand what God's doing sometimes but God does I don't understand how that computer can can process billions of bits and megabytes and all that in that little bitty box and then bring it out and we get to use it but man has simplified it so much to where we're able to just use it and then some people like brother join some of them that have learned more are you getting my point here that have learned more and studied more they have a different level of understanding what that Microsoft means amen Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists God has given them a gift to be able to show you by the logo or the logos of God what God's talking about and what he's all about amen so do you understand a little little better now I did when I saw that I said man that's pretty simple cuz Scholars have called logos all these things but it's the logo of God it's what God is everything that God is is in wrapped up in that logos because you got Son of God who was in the son of man and the logos was made flesh amen who's going to be in the son of David the logos who's inside of you today the same logos is inside of you and the only way for you to understand God is to have that logos in you so that you can understand God that's right amen that's why he says Jesus said I come from God I go back to God now 10 years from now they may change this a little bit but you're still going to know what Microsoft is that's right amen remember God doesn't change but his ability to explain to you yeah his ability to explain it to you and for you to understand it may change we thought he was a trinity at one time oh yeah right right I love that smile G where's she been all our life bless your heart good to see I mean just I like a Zeal but you see that 10 years from now you're still going to if you see that logo you're still going but you may understand more you may go to school you may go to school and learn how to read really break those things down and put the computer together same way with God brothers and sisters the logos of God is what is in you to teach you more about God that we can't understand there's no way you can understand God that's right there's no way you can understand and just like what happened to me the other day that was God doing that I didn't understand it at the time and I believe I got the logos inside of me but my stupid brain didn't filter it right right amen I was in the pity party Department God wasn't in the pity Department Department he was saving somebody Department amen so take that back down and let's read another quote the next one but everybody understand that kind of struck me that that would help us to understand God more it's the logo of God whatever God is is behind that Lo that logos exp to me explains everything now he said well he before that the logos was before that it's just God bringing it down to where we can understand what's going on all right now look let's keep reading he's going to bring it down a little further that look like a Halo hanging Yonder no man has seen God at any time now eye to eye and here's the logos see the logos steps forth the logos hey everybody when you have a logo for your company McDonald's has the highest pole right they don't unless there's an ordinance you don't put McDonald's you don't put the sign of McDonald's down here and hide it in a bush no when you driving down the interstate that's about the first thing you see cuz they put that thing as high as they can put it why so you can what see it first all right same way with God no man has seen God at any time now eye to eye and here's the logos looks like it's a supernatural being it's a Halo that's the Son of God now he goes back into Eternal sunship cuz the word don't don't go good together that's Catholic Doctrine how could it be a sunship be Eternal if he's a son he had to have a beginning amen but it was the logos that went out of God and there he was playing out there in space just like a child before the door I can see him draw the whole picture in his mind of the kingdom and what it might be and then the first thing you know I hear him say let there be light so God is just like brother R said it's a thought first and then it becomes word all right it's a thought you got to think of it first the only thing the only problem with us is we think about something study it mull it over think it may work it may not work and then maybe we speak it no what comes into God's mind he speaks it because that's Eternal it can't change it's right the first time all right then the first thing you know I hear him said let there be light and when he did an Adam broke you under well you can you know continue into the creation but keep going to the next one now look at him back there there he was standing there now light doesn't stand okay so it's a human being amen after all the clinkers you know he he makes that uh analogy of a child playing before the father's door it's kind of like a kind of like a kid playing with blocks but he's not a kid he's creating but what he's doing he's saiding okay I need the moon over here for a certain reason can you imagine somebody standing there just a Gil and all that's inside of it that's why we can't understand that man that he's standing there in eternity and there's nothing and all of a sudden he says let there be life light yeah Sunshine Sun you go right over there and you stay right here and it's been hanging there ever since I don't understand why people can't understand that there's a Creator somewhere this Earth is standing in the middle of space spending at about the same amount of time and it has been forever and there's not an intelligent something moveing this thing I I don't I don't understand but you know you see because brother R said God's writing his first Bible why is he writing his first Bible brother R says I won't read it he says he knew man would look up first it's not it's not it's in one of these quotes but I'm not going to read it for save time I don't want to be too long today but he said he God knew man would look up so he knew the first Bible would be in the Stars so he sat there and he put this one here and he put this one here he's just sitting there and he is like a kid but a kid's over here playing that God's not playing he's got a purpose because you know what that's going to stay there forever this is going to stay there forever the Earth's not going to move move out of his orbit now the orbit is going to tilt back up amen cuz we're doing this because of sin on the Earth right because of the flood what happened in the flood we got it off a little bit that's why it's 365 in the fourth day in the year but it's all going right back to the same what it was before because that's what God spoke sin has just marred it or left it till God comes here cleans this thing up first you know I was thinking about the other day Jesus was born into this world we know it was an Immaculate Conception it was an egg and a sperm that was put together by God himself created by God himself and put into Mary but being that it was put into Mary once it was put into Mary what Mary ate what Mary ate was connected to that body that's why he looked 50 something years old and he was only 30 the curse was on that body of his because of what Mary was eating and because what he eat when he got here he couldn't do anything about that because you know what that's what he said in Genesis 1 he said cursed is the ground that's the same way with you and I when we come up out of this ground and we're born we're cursed we're living in a curse that's why the Bible says I that we plant him in corruption and we raise him in incorruption amen we plant him in corruption but we rais him in incorruption because Jesus when he raised he raised incorrupted he was not corrupted when he raised so that's the same thing with Jesus you say well why did he look old he was eating cursed dirt that he had cursed before he he had cursed back in the garden amen all right so now look at him back there there he was standing there and then he continues on let's go keep going down and when he made everything that looked nice and good now he said let us plural make man plural in our own image what was he there is a supernatural being there's the one that could not be seen couldn't be seen right a logo is no good if you can't see it right just like I said took all the logos down and hide them you walk up to a building and go what is this place no now you walk up to a building and you see all their banners and all the things they tell you what's behind their what's in their building you don't go up to Texico and you you see they branded Texico and you go up to a Texico sign you go I think they sell hamburgers no they don't sell hamburgers you know they sell gas when you're out of gas you pull in a teso when your stomach's empty you pull in a McDonald's why they branded or made that logo so real I hope you're getting this they make that logo so real till you know what it is and when you just look at it in a split second you know what's behind that logo right same way with God when we begin to understand this logos or this son of God that's in you tonight if you have the new birth then you should be able to understand what all is behind it that's right right if you allow it there's the one that cannot be seen God the father never was seen never will be seen he's all nature and there he is and now here's the son which is the logos that went out of him Made In His Image so whatever the Loos look like what the father looks like that's right I've always said when when Adam the first time I believe when Adam turned and looked at God he said man I look like him and God looks at Adam and says he looks just like me we look alike why because that's where he came from right there's the one that couldnot be seen God the father never was seen never will be seen he's all nature there he is now here's the son which was the logos that went out of him Made In His Image a supernatural being that went out in the beginning now you say went out now let's explain that went out he didn't just go you know I go out the door okay God just didn't go out somewhere it's the form that he's using to explain himself all right he led the Beast around then like the holy spirit's can anybody read that say that would you supposed to lead the church today that's right he led the church around that's another thing you know I I I believe I the brother yesterday did a real good job very simple but did a good job you think my sermon is pretty U maybe carnal he his sermon was lounging around the pool the pool of Bethesda lounging around the pool and he made some real good points and one point he made and I really like it is is and I want to explain something to you to have the Holy Ghost that's the inside teacher and we know that some of us need help but we failed to read the quote where brother Bram says every time you come to the altar you get weaker now ain't know what he said you want me to find it I'll find it for you brother Bram says every time you come to the altar you get weaker he said you come one time you get prayed for you don't come back no more that's right amen why because you know that's what the an that's what the brother was saying he he was getting ready to pray for a brother and another brother brother's church and the Pastor said hold on a minute he said we prayed for that man three or four times and he said we're not praying for you no more and know what he said he said you either accept it he said you somehow you must be liking what you got cuz you come up here for every and you know you see like Daddy said you see many people in the in the youth camps the same person comes up every year they're just one year older every year they come up the same thing one year older why that brother finally stopped and he looked at that brother and he said look he said you're not willing to get rid of what you got he said when you're willing to get rid of what you got then God can help you but you just keep coming up here and going back coming up here and going back coming up here and going back shows you faith is weak Jesus said believe Centurion went to him one time he said I found no greater Faith so we see but the reason I made that point is just look supposed to lead the church today we have the full word of God brothers and sisters amen right and that full the word of God says to believe right even the Holy Ghost I want you to pray because I I want to when I go to Jamaica and do this Youth Camp I want to do it a little different than most people do it we're not going to do the crying and screaming and all that stuff they're either going to believe or they going to keep the same thing they got when I leave amen so you pray for me because I want to I'm trying to get a a few sermons together about inner strength because I'll just tell you the the story of Samson the story of Samson the Bible says the the Philistines went crazy they went Bonkers trying to find out he said they said where is the secret of Samson's strength now Samson would have been an Arnold Schwarzenegger 68 300 lb arms this big what secret is that there is no secret right the analogy I'm going to use is he looks like Barney 5 right Don not little because look they went Bonkers trying to find where his strength came from right and the Philistines remember the Philistines remember they were giants they were Fighters they loved to fight they wanted to know how this guy could pick up a city's Gates and him be probably about 5 foot tall weigh about 100 pound soaking wet right CU they the Bible keeps saying secret secret secret the secret was was Samson's Inner Strength it wasn't it didn't have anything to do with outside it was the inner strength that Samson had amen it was that hidden life in God God hiding him self in Simplicity Jesus was a common man they said right and actually the Bible says you didn't want to look at him he would may have been a little bit not very attractive what the Bible says do we even want to look on it so I want to I want to show those people the inner strength of God you got to have Inner Strength that's what brother Dale's preaching about and the only Inner Strength you gets a new birth you can get the Holy Ghost on your spirit and be anointed and do a lot of things but you get that Holy Ghost in your soul h you ain't got to preach Holiness you don't have to preach Holiness cuz when the Bible says for you not to put on a a a garment pertaining to the man why do the preacher have to tell you that why the preacher have to tell you that why the preacher I've tell you not to cut your hair the Bible tells you not to do that right brother Brown didn't bring us these things it was in the Bible all right so that's the same way I I want us to to get away from that of of of Dos and don't but if you get born again to me then brother Brown said it's a love affair right we do things because we love the Lord you know and like Jim said if if he can get on the cross and do the things he did and die for me what little bit can I do is to wear a dress and do what he says in the Bible and not cut my hair and do all those things that's a that's a very small thing versus a man giving his life for you very small same way with you and I oh a lot of times you know we as human beings go boy this person's successful and why is this one doing this why if you ain't born again it ain't going to matter right if ain't Born Again ain't going to matter you can be born again and live in a cave and be Eternal right or live in a trailer that ain't got to me it used to it used to bother me but that don't bother me no more money don't bother me no more than nothing because you can pile it all up and uh and well either the government's going to get it are the atomic bombs going to make it into Ash one of the two don't get me wrong it's okay to have some but but still the Bible has always said that it's better that you can pull a camel through the eye of a needle than to get a rich man into heaven cuz brother Ram said a rich man will lean to his money every time the Super Rich you watch them they do the same thing they sell their soul I don't know why I got into that but let's go to the next thing he put this supernatural being which was called what roll it up brother Bob wake up was called man the third person of the Trinity oh oh my goodness a prophet Lord have mercy look like brother Dale said he ought to put your third person of the Trinity Holy Spirit into mankind that's exactly right that man and he made him in his own image now you know what he's talking about he's addressing those people that were trinitarians at that time you know that if they were stuck into that in that age they didn't know no different the Holy Ghost was the third person of the Trinity to them but what's he trying to do he's trying to bring that out and explain that it's not three different separate people it's one person with three manifestation the triun of God not the Trinity see how close that is the devil many times is like brother Joe was talking about you know we um God teleported philli over to the Ethiopian in unit well see man now is trying to do the same thing in the carnal aspect he's trying to get man I mean wouldn't it be it's like he was talking about if you could if you could teleport something see a terrorist wouldn't have to go to your country to do it he just teleport a bomb from here over to the White House and boom blow it up so you see that's how Satan's doing it but God did it first always remember God's first he does everything first and then Satan behind him perverts it so let's go to the next one and then we'll quit right here excuse me questions and answers on Genesis now if God created man in his own image and his own likeness what kind of man did he create a spirit man now if you notice after you made all the creation and created a spirit man the close reading of this now to the one that asked the question will find this that God give dominion of the cattle and the fish and everything to the man but in his making up there he made him in his own image to lead the cattle lead the Beast of the field just like the Holy Spirit leads the believer today he was in other words Adam the first man in the lower creation the first creation was God himself that's what we just been talking about amen because what happened one day with Microsoft Microsoft Bill Gates and a couple other guys sat down around a table in in the late or middle 80s and they said we want to have computers but we really don't know how to do it but we're going to bring people in and we're going to what they do they developed a business plan there was no logo right but over time they developed a logo to go behind the business that they had created same way with God the only way listen the only way we can understand God Is by human stuff really honestly the only way we the only way I can understand adoption and things like that is by H by me being a human the only way I can understand one God is that I'm one person person but when my wife comes up to me I manifest a different attribute as a husband but now I'm also a granddaddy and Diana's not here today so I don't have to display that attribute but if she come running through that door y'all would just have to be quiet because I'd be a grandfather why I'm the same person though see the the way to understand God is to understand you and the way you grow up is the way you go through first grade all the way up to grade number 12 you learn by the things you suffer amen you learn by the things you s you know what the Bible says he grew in Grace and knowledge learned by the things he suffered same way with you and I we got to learn by the way we suffer but we must understand to understand this logos but in other words Adam the first man and the Lord creation of God the first creation was God himself now was the prophet confused or was he trying to tell us something the first creation Now the first creation wasn't God God is the creator but in our brain the First Development or the word fashion put in there the first fashioning of God was that Lo out of God comes the logos what something that you and I can understand we can understand now Microsoft because now they have what promoted their product they have put a sign on every store they have they put a sign on every uh computer that they have and you understand that that was what that's a computer company same way with God God when you see the word logos to me that explains all of God where he come from where he's going where he's at and what he's doing he's in each one of us that that's just to me that and to me that makes the Loos simple because when I first come back into the message that word logos bothered me because I'm like they explain it to be this and it's speech and it's this but it's a man it's God stepping out so that we can understand him condescending so that we as a peanut brain group of people can understand a God that you can't understand he's put his logo or his logos has stepped forward and the whole Bible to me to me you can see cuz you know you say well I don't see Jesus the Flesh in the Old Testament the flesh you hear but now I see MDC who was what the the logos right but it was Jesus Christ amen but it was Jesus but it wasn't the flesh Jesus that man mzc as he stood on Earth could not die for your sins right but that logos that was in him was the same one that gave his life to release that because listen I want this is I'm going to end it right here the only way we can get a revelation a true Revelation is to have the Revelator in inside of us the only way you can get I'm talking about a true Revelation sure there's things on earth we get a revelation a lot of times like I got a revelation I couldn't get myself out of that hole the other day but that was a human Revelation I didn't have nothing new with God but it but remember it did have something to do with God I just didn't see it at the time or understand see I didn't see it or understand what was going on but the logos is which was the son of God that shows all the way down all the way down even in now in me and you he's what the Son of God amen amen but the only way the only way brother that that you and I can look in the Bible and get a revelation or an understanding of what it says is because that same person that wrote it's inside you that's right that's right last illustration for some of the new ones that had been here the last illustration I'm going to sit here and I'm going to write my life with June for 36 years and I'm going to write it all down to some of you it'll be the most boring piece of literature that you've ever read but if there some way I could get my mind the very person of me right listen to this the very person of me inside of brother Mark see he just read it and go well that's pretty good y'all must have pretty good life cuz you did this and this and this and this that's pretty good thank you see you bye but if I can put myself project me that would that went through that I went through all those words that was written that was my experience but if I can put me inside brother Mark and then him read that and go man I was there wouldn't you read it a little different same way with that that was the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was now made flesh that's why we're under the son of man ministering it's the word made flesh in me and you today not one person but a many membered body we're able to understand how we act and how we how that God controls us amen CU remember if you're born again in your soul you're as Eternal as God is right why do you need to work on the spirit because the spirit's caught between here and there right right spirit's caught between here and there that's why to me the new birth births your soul amen this right here works on your spirit that's right amen this works on your spirit cuz remember it's either Faith or doubt in the soul it's not all these it's either Faith or doubt now it comes from down there and works its way out but it's got to work its way through the spirit and the only thing left now is the body if you have that if you don't have that you still got to work on that Spirit realm memory reason conscious affection that's where all this comes from memory reason conscience affection imagination that's why I said the statue of perfect man is very important right cuz you'll never get clean without it sure your Soul's clean sure everything's going to be fine but you know what you really never understand the logos because when he walked on the earth in a body of flesh he was these things he didn't lack any of them and now if that word was made flesh back then then if you take the word and it becomes a part of you then it becomes the word made flesh in you amen the word made flesh today we can Glory about the word made flesh in Jesus's time because we know who he is but why can't we be the poster child sir why can't we be the logo like brother Dale was talking about this morning the only way you're going to know it is on the outside that's the only way you're going to know it you're only going to know it and you know what you can trick somebody for a little while amen but you can't trick them forever somewhere down the line something's going to happen in your Humanity if you don't have that logos dwelling in your soul there's somewhere down the line that is going to be made manifest because look the logos is the word it's the word amen it's all the word not 99% of it it's the word and when it's made flesh it has to express itself it has to this is the day of manifestation let's stand this is the day of manifestation this is the day that you're going to either you're going to show your logo one way or the other amen is that all right that okay we can say say logo that's the logo that's the promotion of God and and you know what you and I we're going to either promote god of the devil one of the two amen you're going to promote god of the devil one of the two and if you promote the logos then you're going to act just the way the logos acted amen that's right our problem is preeminence that's our problem our problem is preeminence it's that one where brother brandham said supposed to be led by the Holy Spirit sometimes we lead our self and we get self- involved and when we get self involved we always come up wrong we all just like I did the other day I got self involved I got self emotions involved in that situation and to me it didn't turn out worth a flip until I look back I mean people I know I was heading down I said man this is great 5 minutes I'm I got about to that door right there and and I just had to stop the lawnmower and I just stopped I mean it wasn't like somebody physically hit me in the back of the head but it was like somebody physically hit me in the back of the head and said wait a minute what have you been preaching what do you preach out what do you what do you tell people that you're so insignificant but yet if somebody changes your tire sister G on the side of the road man change your tire he may be the biggest whoremonger that ever lived on the day of the earth and me biggest drunk but on the day of judgment God said I'll not forget it here and I won't forget it there he knows he's done for I mean he knows it but God thinks so much of sister Gail sister Gail's way in the back about 10 million people behind in the back she goes Lord he turns around goes what remember he changed my tire he said I just was waiting for you to say that he said enter into the joy of the Lord just because of that sister right back there so don't think you're insignificant if you ever get stuck in a hole with a lawnmower pray somebody comes by and helps you yeah let's thing a song the meeting in the air number 94 number 94 94 in the spiral book Daddy's done throw all the books out got to have one you love the Lord God's good to us isn't he he's just wonderful he's here when we need him and you know what you ain't got to call for him he's right there he's right there with you all right you have heard of fearless David and his SL you have heard the story told of dreaming J and of Jonah and the whale you often sing there are many many others Through the Bible I should like to meet them all I do declare Richard at that meeting in the air there is going to be a meeting in theet I am going to meet you meet you over there in that home

beond the sty singing you will hear never heard by morally will be glorious I to declare and God's old son will be the leading one at that meeting in the end amen the doubters will be missing at that meeting because a mner bench all the Skeptics will be absent on that day there will be no grumblers whoa present to disturb us and the achens will be busy far away there the Saints will have his seal upon their foreheads dressed in rment none but Ransom ones can wear Angels can't even wear that see even today like we're talking about see the Angels they saw when God was doing all this cuz he created angels first right to to worship all right but remember you and I were there before the Angels were right his children's got to be there before the angel amen we just weren't there in physical being we were there in the mind of God Amen he had those thoughts but to develop those thoughts he had to bring Angels because he was what he was God made him an object of worship so the Angels but you know what when it come down to where he said let there be and then he brought a man and then Adam and Eve come forth and the angels kind of looked at God and we don't understand this we don't understand this we don't understand what's going on here we cuz remember their intent was worship worship the Creator they're not Sons and Daughters of God they're not an offspring of of God so they didn't understand a lot of things amen they didn't understand they they don't understand a Redemption Song Redemption they that's not even part of their vocabulary why they're not Sons and Daughters of God we fail we fail and that's what the rest of that quote was in the in the church age book sure yeah we were Sons and Daughters of God before the foundation of the world not his people but the attribute now when that attribute comes into that logos and that logos comes down and comes into you then there's that attribute that it was before the foundation of the world and now you can say I come from God and I go back to God any of you that are born again you come from God that's what where it's where you came from no I come from Mom and Daddy temporarily temporarily temporarily just to get you down here to make a choice the prophet of God said get you here to make your choice when I didn't God know what that choice was amen didn't knew what that choice was but you don't they asked brother Brown they said brother Brown why you still preaching if all this is done and over with like you're saying he said I just don't know who's saved and who's not you just have to preach like they all saved throw the net out there you know and you get snakes and spiders and sea turtles and all that stuff he said but you catch a fish every once in a while amen you get a fish and that's what we're doing we're looking for that last fish I told brother Joe Dad read that scripture this morning where says Jesus said going to all the world and preach the gospel and then there's one where it says you know go into every uh nation and then the end will come well hello all we got to do is find five more countries to listen to us right if there's 191 that's already listen you say us I mean us the bride there's five of them that we got to find and when we do brother L we're gone cuz this this went to All Nations then there's five nations wandering out there somewhere blind but we we got to get to the last one you love the Lord have a safe journey back home I hope this has helped you just a little bit let's what we're I mean this is just a part of what we're doing downstairs and uh we haven't got from the logos yet have we sister Johnny we're still on the L God so we got to get down and keep going down and keep going down and we're going to break it down all the way down to the son of David because I believe it's it's important that we understand cuz like brother Brown said if you're at the bus station waiting on the train right what you want to go somewhere but you're in the wrong place that's right so and and it is good we know what the Son of God dispensation was the church a dispensation but to take a body change a Son of God didn't take a body change Son of God don't need a body change I don't like to say son of God does not need a body change never has that logos never needed a body change that was a supernatural body but now the son of man is the one that took the body changed so we've got to understand that son of man Revelation in order for our body to be changed so see without the son of man revelation we can't take a body change that's and look this is just this is the Son of God Revelation this is not the son of man Peter James and John preach this to hear that's the son of man Revelation they did not understand who that man Jesus was right and they will not understand who you are if you're born again the world will never understand you cuz they never understood Jesus right wasn't very popular cuz he wasn't normal I like that let's bow our head dear heavenly father we pray Lord that you would be with us take these words Lord that's been spoken and maybe it'll drop in someone's heart and they'll understand you just a little bit better Lord not that we any way comparing you to anything of McDonald's or anything like that you know that's not in our heart Lord but to get a natural EXP explanation of you Lord we have to use natural things we pray now Lord that you would be with us and bless us take care of us be with the pastor be with all the deacons and the elders be with the other ministers of the church here all the ones that has a part to do with anything in this congregation we pray that you would bless them Father give us strength for the days ahead bless us as we go home save our loved ones heal the sick be with the ones that are not here Lord that you would Minister to their heart we ask you now that you just take care of us lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit in Jesus name we pray amen your dismissed Heaven father I appreciate you heavenly father I appreciate you you I love you adore you I bow down before you heavenly father I appreciate you Holy Spirit you're a comfort to me Holy Spirit to to
