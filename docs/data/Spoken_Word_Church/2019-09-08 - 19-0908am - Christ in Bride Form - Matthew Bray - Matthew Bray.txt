blessings restaurant each one of you as we look to the word today and I trust that something will be shared in the inspiration of God's Spirit that will help but edify your faith amen and strengthen you in this journey amen because we all want to get ready to go meet the Lord last four verses of this chapter the Bible says in the voice which I heard from heaven spake on to me again ain't you glad he spake unto us again there's seven thunder voices spoke from heaven but John says after he heard that voice he spake to him again amen that's right we need to Lord Jesus to speak to us praise God and said go and take the little book what book you think that is go and take this book go and take the little book which is open is it a sealed book or is it on sealed book is it a closed book or non open book take the book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and we know what angel that is right king theophany jesus christ and i went on to the little angel and said unto him give me the little book he kind of says that brother wait reminds me of something it's almost like it belonged to him because he was Togo take the little book and he says give me the book does that book belong to you are you the people of the book are you written in that book is that book a book of redemption do you see yourself in Redemption amen is that book belong to you there's that book written about you amen and then went on said angels said onto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angels hand and ate it up and it was exactly like the angel said it would be and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter he got he got to digest in that word after awhile and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings let's pray our dear gracious Heavenly Father God we love you this morning we thank you Father for gathering us to in good health and strength and all those that couldn't be here father we ask that you send your healing angel Lord to sweep through their homes father and wherever they are grant your touch I pray and these that are sitting present father we just ask for the liberty of your Holy Spirit to come take this word God and so quicken it to our hearts that Christ can truly take flesh in us Lord that the mystery that you had in the back part of your mind can now come into their humble little lives of our selves father and be expressed so set forth and so real and such a blessed reality of your presence and and you take in flesh in us Lord God so we can be changed your prophet said Lord that Jesus will be so into their bodies he'd be able to change them father we know that's the promise of this age that's what we're looking at that's what we've been led up to to see that part of the word is now to be expressed and interpreted by you blessing father we ask him pray your touch today in Jesus Christ's name on each and every one amen and God bless you all so much you can be seated god bless your your precious pastor and all you dear minister and brethren here I really always appreciate this church and the support it's really blessed to have this kind of fellowship here you know you got brother Bob black right you got brother Aaron Roberts there you got brother Louise if there's any other ministers here god bless you so much we appreciate you this is an hour that the that the bride really needs to be pressing in this is an hour that ministers need to be ministering people need to be expressing the divine revelation of Christ they've been because faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God there's been so many times in my life brothers sisters where the Holy Spirit has blessed men and abled me to glean from ministers to glean from the Prophet messenger of the age because it's all the anointing of the Lord and the word of the Lord coming together through gifts and operations of the Spirit to benefit and bless our lives to benefit and bless our faith is that right so my prophet was walking through the woods one time and stepped over a cigarette pack and the Lord said go back and pick that up and he said huh not me and their lords toad brother brand go back and pick that up brother Brendan went back and picked up a cigarette pack and the Lord spoke to him and gave him a message you know what message I was thinking man's filter brethren got a message and got inspired because the Holy Spirit the Lord was directing him and I believe the bridesmaid of the same kind of material the bride can catch inspiration the bride can catch the revelation of faith because she's ordained as a vessel to be inspired of the Lord in that way is that right how many's gleaned revelation off the record sermons of a vindicated prophet our whole lives do I need to stand up here for the next two hours and say hey press play press play God sent a prophet you already know that we're supposed to get into the message and the message is supposed to get into us and the word is supposed to become spirit in life into people amen the great payoff of God sending a prophet is an endtime bride and I chose our pastors today to try to express underscore and highlight this simple principle and I'm sure you've heard it ministered on but I just want to kind of highlight it today if you notice brother Branham often referred to revelations 10-7 is that right and he told us showed us this scripture that the one that came down from heaven with the rainbow around his head was Jesus Christ he put one foot on the land one foot on the sea and we know the image of the beast comes out of the land and the beast came out of the sea so the Lord Jesus put his feet on these two things right here and brother brems says foot steps means possession so the Lord Jesus Christ is exercised and expressed in our book of symbols how he has total dominion over Jezebel and Ahab he's got total dominion over church and state he's got total dominion over Rome in the United States so there ain't no big back beast and there ain't no big bad image of the Beast is gonna hurt this bride because the bride's husband the word Jesus Christ has got a conquered just like when David went son that stone at the giant Goliath he hit the ground so hard it must have shook over around and in David when the Bible says David stood on top of glass and cut his head off is that right that's right so he conquered that and that serpent seed devil and art David in these last days has come forth been introduced by vindicated prophet because truly the vindication of John the Baptist was Christ on presence himself and the vindication of brother Benno's ministry is Christ himself coming forth and I believe with all my heart this worldwide bride is led by Christ you believe that they've been brother Branham fulfilled the one man ministry he's the fulfillment of that one man ordained for the Aged and brother Branham was everybody's pastor brother branch said Elijah was Jezebel's pastor so brother brand is a pastor of everybody in this age so when you when people claim brother branham's my pastor we know what they're mean and they're mean and they don't really go along with any other pastor but brother Browns their pastor well when you think about it in the light of what brother Branham said it ain't saying much cuz Jezebel was under the headship of Elijah Pope Francis is under the headship of William man Branham so brother Branham is a Pope's pastor God spoke through the mouthpiece in these last days and that's God's voice to everybody that's God's voice to the world but we know only the bride can actually pick up what the husband is saying is that right only the bride could come under perfect and complete headship to that word so all kinds of people claim brother Branham as their daddy is that right and Abraham's the father of our faith is that right but there's a difference between being in church and being in Christ there's a difference between claiming to be in the message and actually being in the faith is that right so I wanted to express today how there's this tremendous thing that the Lord's showed us through the years about this time where the scripture is read like when Jesus went into the synagogue they gave him the the scroll of Isaiah Isaiah is 66 chapters and brother Graham Tata said Isaiah represents the whole Canon of Scripture so when Jesus went into the synagogue as this custom was they handed to him the scroll of Isaiah and the Bible says Jesus found where it was written st. Luke chapter 4 verse 17 he found where it was written and what was written was written of himself what he would do in that hour the Lord Jesus was dealing with a present truth a particular part of the word brothers and sisters that God was making come to pass right there in the present hour now that is extremely important because we all see brother Brennan is part of the prophecy we all see that God sent Eliezer to call out a bride we all see brother Branham was sent by God but there's more scripture when you look up this part of the scripture and find places where brother Branham referred to it there's only a couple places but so many message focused stopped at revelations 10-7 that there's more scripture there's rest of the chapter revelations 10-7 was brother branham's part but there's another part there's other scripture when the Lord Jesus read the part of the word that he read that was the word for that very hour but there's more prophesy for other hours coming after that is that right so whenever you read the part that Jesus fulfilled the Holy Spirit reveals to you the power and the influence of that impacts our lives of the part that's already been fulfilled well what about the influence of the word that he's fulfilling right now are you conscience are you aware of what part of the words being interpreted in our lives right now because you see God sent a prophet and the Lord took him home in 1965 but what's been happening between 1965 and 2019 what part of the Bible can you identify is the word being interpreted in those days in your day many of us here are born after brother Branham was taken home I was born in 1970 isn't there any scripture pertaining to these days huh because it was so important in the days of Jesus for people to be conscience of what part of the word God was manifesting right there for had they missed it they missed eternal life that's right to walk in the consciousness of what part of the word God is making manifest in your hour is connected to knowing God not knowing of him not just reading the historical idea about him but actually knowing him to know Christ is actually know him personally to know him personally is to recognize that he's alive and that he is fulfilling some part of the word today what part is that I asked message folks sometimes did you know brother Graham was sent to restore the faith of the Apostles a made in Malachi 4 I believe it well what's the faith of the Apostles I thought using the message man because so many people today say well we don't understand that we just believe it well brother Brian said a true eagle will understand the message true Eagles understand Daniels 70th week - Eagles understand marriage and divorce torito's understand predestination election adoption because the Holy Spirit Christ is here to lead guides read the word them the bride in and through the word so I wanted to share this passage to show you don't make the mistake that so many people make they're scared to not read more scripture because brother Branham really didn't deal with that you'd be surprised with brother Branham dealt with that's just hidden right there in that message in the message called marriage of the Lamb brother Branham actually referred to memucan in the first chapter of Esther but he never called him by name brother Branham just referenced him and said but there was a man there with some wisdom about him and many ken was the seventh prince that sat in the presence of the king and he brought an indictment against Vashti you or does that remind you of somebody today somebody bring an indictment against Jezebel somebody bring an indictment against the church and in the first chapter of Esther you find the seventh prince bringing a message of indictment against a woman and then the king was so pleased with the amendment consent he had his message translated all the known tongues and sent around the world does that remind you of anybody first chapter of Esther brother Branham never brought that out but I want a message believer to deny that part of the scripture you can't it's right there in plain sight there's many places brother Branham took us to and then the idea was for you to pick up from there dig down in it because where the ban was sent to reveal there's a lot of thing he never explained he was just sent to reveal by the spoken word under the power and influence of the Holy Ghost the spoken word would shed light on the written word and you as a message believer are supposed to take that spoke and work back to the Bible and come to real faith is that right because we know that there's things hid in the word that pertain to us is that right because when you find you believe brother branham's wrote up in the Bible we had a little Bible study with Bob's family the other night and we've shown the kids how this Bible was written approximately 1900 to 2000 years ago but there's specific and graphic detail about brother branham's life his ministry and everything like that in the Bible and brother Brandon was born April 6 1909 but there was already a Bible written and it fit the pattern of his life perfectly people in the Bible and even like brother Branham and prophets and believers sometimes do things so unconsciously they're not even aware that that's what's written and that's what's being fulfilled but friends this end-time bride has come into such more and more of a divine consciousness don't you believe that because you must so in order to overcome and rise above this age you must know what's written of you you must know it the way brother Branham knew it you must know it the way Jesus knew what was written of him you have to come into such a place of reality that when you read the Bible you say right there that plan a Redemption that's written of me how many believes that today all right so just making a point the last four verses of Revelation even though brother Branham only referred to it a couple times doesn't mean you're not supposed to deal with there doesn't mean I supposed to be into it and ask to the Lord for a light on that word brother Graham told us the Seventh Seal has three parts right and we know by inspiration that there's a three-fold mystery to the whole Bible because in March he preached the seven seals 1963 but in July he preached Christ the mystery of God revealed and what he brought out of that sermon was that the whole Bible is one goal that God had in his mind but that one go had three parts right God in Christ Christ in you Christ in the bride and then the husband and wife take him back to a glorified Eden right so it's very simple the way that God has let the Prophet categorize the whole plan to us if you can just sit and meditate and receive that word you begin to see the whole Bible open up brother Graham said the Bible is like two great wings of an eagle old testament and new testament to take us out to give us a faith to fly away from this mortal world and he said it's like husband and wife though Testament is the husband the New Testament is the wife two halves in one whole husband and wife is that right you remember brother Graham saying that whenever the New Testament opens the Yosi husband and wife husband and wife husband and wife Joseph and Mary Zechariah and Elizabeth Anna and Simeon because it's a revelation coming forth that Lord Jesus had something sealed up on the inside of him is that right the Lord Jesus went to Calvary with a sealed mystery on the inside because when Adam was expressed in flesh like we were studying last night Adam had something sealed up in him Adam had a mystery sealed up in him everybody knows what I'm talking about now right Jesus had a mystery sealed up in him in these last days this Bible were taught was sealed with seven seals so the Lord Jesus and Adam both being spoken word sons of God had something within them that was sealed in Genesis 5:1 it says this is the book of the generation of Adam and then in Matthew chapter 1 says this is the book of the generation of Jesus Christ so the book always had a genealogy in it Adam's genealogy Jesus Christ has a spiritual gene and genealogy is that right so in the last days the Lord Jesus doesn't have to come back and flesh and be crucified because he already did that but when they tore his flesh open it was given birth to an alpha bride is that right so we know how the fall comes I want you to think about this today because this is so awesome whenever God opened the side of Adam brought forth Eve that brought a bride aged to Eden and in that bride age the serpent entered in and defiled Eve and defiled the whole place so whenever the Lord Jesus was opened up on Calvary opened up his side it brought out an alpha bride age and in the Alpha bride age the Antichrist spirit entered in with false teaching and false doctrine and defiled the Apostolic age and made it drift off into a church age is that right so in these last days the Bible talked about the Omega side of the equation the glory of the latter house will be greater than the glory of the former's at the prophecy but this book was sealed through the ages but it had to come a time when it becomes unsealed and that's why we're doing all revelations chapter 10 because where the RAM told us in plain language that's the seventh seal brother but you can see what the seventh seal is in Scripture because your prophet said revelations 10 was the seventh seal and it's the coming of the Lord it's a secret coming to unite himself with an enzyme bride to get the place of preeminence and an enzyme people so he can change them in the atoms and catch them away that's the mystery of redemption under the Seventh Seal is it not brothers the coming of the Lord but the coming of the Lord is mystery secret right but we're into a certain aspect of this threefold mystery because we see the first part is a shout or a message of Jesus Christ himself being expressed his personal presence but that is to call a people and unite with them the second part of that threefold mysteries revelations 10 8 to 11 because the third part is the Trump which were the branch said to prophets Moses and Elijah and that's in Revelation chapter 11 so you can superimpose shout voice Trump / revelations 10 one to seven would be the shout revelations 10 8 to 11 would be the voice because brother Brennan said she's the final voice to the final age and Christ in her makes her the voice of God for the hour I got quotes brothers am I on the message that's right she's the final voice to the final age we read in the church age book the other day where the ground said the voice of God would be in her and you just read a passage where the angel of the Lord Jesus Christ told John thou must prophesy again and who does John represent in this passage the bride right you can take it what's the overall church of the ages that's true but when you look close John actually represents the endtime Bride because they tried to kill John couldn't kill him because he's a type of the bride that goes home by way of translation and not death is that right and John also heard the seven thunders so then time bride hears the seven thunders john was also showed these great things by an angel who was a prophet is that right so it's actually john represents the end time bride everybody see that today so when you understand that john represents the bride you can see by type shadow and symbolic language which is prophetic language that God uses what the program is what the plan of God is now we know that the true Bride of Christ is scattered through all the nations because we're the RAM saw her out of every nation is that right remember the vision that he had to the bride brother branch said that she had the banner over her breast and there was representing every nation so it's a worldwide bride you'll never get the bride altogether until the resurrection and the translation and that's one of the issues that we have in these last days but in God's wisdom we see brother Martin that it's perfect God's called a Gentile bride out of all the nations amen that was all together in the Upper Room but we're not all together today all of our brothers and sisters are scattered out throughout the nations but there ain't no distance in prayer we can be praying for one another amen and the power of the Living Christ can take this bride on to full maturity and change her and Adams and catch her away how many know God's gonna bring it to pass that's right so you see the point I'm trying to make here brother branham's part stopped at verse 7 but the bride's part picks up at verse 8 the Lord gave me a message some years ago from 7 to 8 we translate because the millennium is the seventh day then we go from the seventh day into the 8th is that right when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's eternal life 7 speaks a time 8 speaks of eternity fro from 70 we translate we find this pattern all down through the Bible it's interesting to me that in Genesis chapter 37 it's the story of Joseph being rejected by his brethren sold by almost 30 pieces of silver young people well we went over the other day is that right but right in between Genesis 37 and 39 a Gentile woman comes in to receive seed why is the woman's part associated with eight huh even in the Millennium when John Luke he sees a bride coming down out of heaven as a as a bride adorned for her husband it's the new heavens and new earth coming after the Millennium so in Revelations 10-7 is the prophets part than 10-8 is the bride's part because God has placed us in a pattern we're moving from time into eternity and it's been foreshadowed that way in the Bible there's a reason why the Song of Solomon has eight chapters because the Song of Solomon is Christ in the bride going back and forth crashing the bride in there's eight chapters is that right I want to share something with you just today was just simply about Christ and bride form because we all recognize vindication with the Prophet Christ was veiled behind a prophet to bring forth the mysteries of the Bible tie up all the loose ends and it would be the revealing of the Son of man that actually calls out a bride we can't do away with that part it is extremely important but let's go on to know the present tense reality of what Christ is doing in a redeemed people Amen I don't believe the bride needs to be told God sent a prophet press play stay with the message I stay with the message every day the Lord Jesus comes to me and anoints me to understand what brother Branham saying I'm not trying to figure anything out I'm letting the Holy Ghost inspire to me what about you huh I try to tell young people how important it is to meditate in the word it ain't about starting a message just so you can finish it that's not what the sermons of the Prophet or for those sermons are so impregnated with certain truths you got to unpack those things you got to let the Holy Spirit inspire those things to you because there's people that's read the sermons for years go over things and miss stuff I'll be honest if you know boning me I'll admit I've been reading the message for years and years and sometimes the Holy Spirit really has to arrest my attention set me down and I find things in that spoken word message that I really miss prior I got an example here today that I shared that brother Sammy integers church one day and I was telling brother Dale in the office the Lord really got a hold of me one morning whenever I went to work I just picked the bestest book out of a bookshelf went to work and the boss told me Matthew you got two trucks today I want you to sit here and wait for them true trucks and when they get here unload them I said okay so I set an office and waited for the trucks to show up but I was reading my new ministry I was meditating in this sermon and I was taking my time because I had all day and the Holy Spirit was so sweet to me not come in just right there and the Holy Spirit would make sure I would was paying attention and the Lord ministered something to me out of the sermon that changed my life frankly it changed my ministry it's so powerful and it was done in such simplicity and just meditation in the word it was so wonderful it's communion with Christ I didn't say hey I listened to a message today it's more like the Lord Jesus came to me and shared something with me from the prophets message that opened up the whole Bible that's what the message is for I noticed for the first time because I always thought just in passing that there were six squirrels spoken into existence and I got once I seen what I seen I got on the phone I started calling preachers hey how many preach how many squirrels are spoken existence some folks said three some brother said four I said brother there was seven squirrels three in Salem Alabama in Salem Alabama Salem Indiana and four in Campbellsville Kentucky but the Lord showed me there's a pattern because brother Brahim said it was the Lord confirming my commission those seven squirrels represent the seven spoken word mysteries of the seven thunders because the same voice that spoke squirrels into existence is the same voice that unfolded the mystery underneath the seven seals and the seven thunders are the revelations contained in the seven seals so brother Barnett Branham was anointed with Christ to speak squirrels into existence he was anointed of Christ to speak what with the hidden mystery was in the Bible but whenever I was reading this brother sisters I noticed that there was a pattern to it that resembled how he ministered the seals because in between the six squirrel and the seven squirrel Tony's able put a question mark to Brother Browns testimony and those questions and answers inserted in between the sixth seal the seventh seal and then when brother Branham goes back to find that seventh and final squirrel he looks all over the place and he can't find it because it's at seventh mystery you got to dig a little bit deeper to find the first six seals are easy those are spoken clearly brother Brennan who publicly told us what they symbolize what they mean how they're placed out and the herd of deer ministers say that it none of the six seals cause contention among believers because you got a point blank it's the seventh seal that causes division the seventh seal remembers the coming of the Lord but watch how it symbolized there how God was patterning it through the Prophet while you're hunting squirrels he goes to look for that seventh squirrel and then the Lord spoke to him and said now say it'll be there and it'll be there because he looked all over he knew he shot at seven but he only recovered six and he went back the next day to look for the seventh one and brethren says that the Lord told him says go pick up that piece of bark right you remember that let's go go pick up that piece of bark and then he said he moved that piece of bark out of the way there wasn't that in there all right remember what the bark represented in restoration of the bride tree Brent said the bark was the doctrine of holiness Wesley's church age and then he said he looked down and wasn't nothing there and then he was standing there an amazement looked down again he's seen a piece of grey hair sticking out from underneath the leaf he reached down and there was that seven squirrel but I want you to notice it was under the bark and under a leaf under the bark that's the Wesleyan Church age the doctrine of holiness under the leaf represents the Pentecostals where the branch said clapping rejoicing so under Wesley's aged under Pentecostal age didn't you get the meat the word because Reverend said his favorite me was squirrel meat amen that seven squirrel was hid deeper than the other squirrels were and there's a great pattern to this brunch sisters because brother Branham says here and these quotes immediately after the seven squirrels the first time that third Pole operated on a human being was Hattie right so brother Branham is a seventh church age messenger he's featured in revelations ten seven right after brother Browns ministry is a bride being brought out and being brought to maturity under the headship of Christ and being brought into speaking conditions so right after the seven scores are spoken Hattie writers told whatever you say Hattie God's telling me right now to tell you whatever you say so it's a pattern brother Branham says immediately after the seven squirrels the first time it was done he says here in my new ministry I looked a sister Hattie the first time it was ever performed on a human being I said sister Hattie ask what you will and God is going to give it to you so get the idea it's very simple God anoints brother Branham why son squirrels brother branham is meditating in mark 11 Lord is that in the atonement an angel of the Lord said that's part of the atonement and in the Lord was dealing brother Branham who is that that speaks about the people on the platform is that you they says Oh Lord forgive me that's been you the whole time it's it's Christ in the profit and it's Christ in the bride it's all about the Lord Jesus amen like that poem in the church age book once it was the blessing now it is the Lord once it was the feeling now it is his word once his gift I wanted now the give her own once I sought for Hill and now himself alone all in all forever Jesus will I sing everything in Jesus and Jesus everything not the prophet of Jesus not preachers in Jesus not the church in Jesus just Jesus just give me Jesus come on is that the way you believe it's a day without him what do you have nothing what's brother Brandon without Jesus what's the bride without Jesus what's the message churches without Jesus huh so alien about him I think that should be our focus I appreciate the way God has blessed my life through ministers but I don't worship ministers I don't wash your prophets and whenever I go to heaven I don't want to go to be the first one to shake brother Browns hand I want to be like brother Branham when he went over there he said where's Jesus where's the one that died for me where's the one that purchased my soul is that right the Lord Jesus is who I see when I read the Bible amen and what you want is the Holy Spirit to anoint you with such a faith that you see yourself in him and you see him in you is that right so how many understands what I'm what I'm kind of laying out here after the prophets part there's a bride and God for shadowed this right in the story or in the experience of hunting squirrels after the seventh squirrel a woman is told to speak paddy had to say her part paddy has H and her first name in the H and her last name the letter H is featured in a lot of these women in the Bible that are typing the bride Ruth Rahab Rebecca right many of them and the letter H is the eighth letter in the alphabet right so we go from seven to eight we go from time to each see so you go from the seventh church age messenger to a bride and she's the final voice to the final age under her messenger but brother Brown said the voice that God will be in her and revelations 22 verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come the bride saying with the spirit saying is that right so it's really a fantastic reality amen I don't know that I've read many quotes here brothers but I think you are familiar enough with the message to know brother Brent says now it's begin to form in Bride form the Christ in the form of his bride that's the revelation of the hour Christ was veiled in a prophet now through the spoken word ministry and the power of the Holy Spirit that has called and separated a bride Christ has gained the place of preeminence and somebody somebody's got their mind renewed somebody's under preeminence to the word and that's an endtime bride is God gonna anoint this bride to overcome this age what is the overcoming factor in the bride its Christ himself remember pick up your pen and write the Holy Spirit said the word is in the bride as it wasn't Mary is that right and now that's in the church age book but in spoken words or in the original CD says the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word she has the word rightly divided to her because she's been divided from the church is that right the red description in Luke 12 because in our second service today the Lord will and I was going to get into at that chapter Luke 12 and talk about the separated bride because this is Christ and bride form today amen so you have something going on right now in this age that's been foreshadowed in the Bible the false church system was foreshadowed in the Bible government uniting what that church is for shout in the Bible Elijah come to prophesy its doom foreshadowed in the Bible a bride being called out and being brought into spoken word conditions that's foreshadowed down through scripture amen I wanted you to write this down and do this sometime go to the Book of Proverbs read the first seven chapters you don't have to do it right now but just make a note of it Solomon is speaking in 7 straight chapters and in the eighth chapter it's a woman starting to speak that woman's wisdom because jesus said that wisdom is justified of her children I asked the Lord one time says why does the Bible refer to wisdom as a woman as a she and then Lord direct me to a quotation of the Prophet in the church age book I believe I got my answer and like the reader for you remember there's eight chapters in the book of the Song of Solomon and I'm trying to share you a pattern that is totally scriptural amen and I believe it's important to understand because it's relating to you the bride the called out bride you must be conscience of what is written of you in this Bible because that's how brother Branham overcame that's how Jesus overcame and that's how the same time bride's gonna overcome you have to see the pattern you have to see how God placed it here because you got a walk conscience and swauk in that reality is that right sin doesn't overtake you you overcome it death is not to overtake you in these last days here to overtake it that's the reality so Christ has to be in your vessel re leaven in the lump that you are leavened with and sin right to re leaven you with eternal life and then you rise above the more Towe mortal condition and evil overcome death that's the Lord Jesus himself doing that into people that's very very serious don't you think friends that is a reality to people in the earth today we don't know who they all are but Christ sure does if anything see it as it's been given to us through the word to know that's the reality I keep telling the young people don't let the news media don't let you know people and things and this age and the media dictate the reality of this age to you because it's not accurate they feed you what they want you to think but it's the Bible a thinking man's filter that actually interprets the reality of the age that you live in you're at the end of a Gentile dispensation God's getting ready to turn from the Gentiles and go call little Benjamin that's the reality but before he does that he gets an endtime people ready and prepared brother Graham said in endtime evangelism that endtime evangelism is to get the bride ready and prepared for the rapture is that right so there really nothing else to be involved with we have church but what is church for its edify your walk with the Lord it's to help you get closer to Christ amen go with me to first Kings book of first kings I'm gonna read this quote to you about this woman brother Brandon refers to the bride and then I'm gonna share with you a pattern of something that the Lord Jesus let me notice and that is really floated my boat really good and I've been rejoicing in this for the whole year now I got it right here but I wanted to find it over here first Kings chapter 6 is where we're going to start we're gonna wind up in chapter 8 and that's another thing of all places first Kings chapter 8 is speaking of the temple that Solomon build amen you think that's a coincidence oh there's God portraying something here all right I want you to also notice in first Kings chapter 8 there's 66 verses and the 66 the verse which is the final verse of chapter 8 it says King Solomon sent the people happy and rejoicing to their tents hmm to their tents so King Jesus get ready dismiss his bride to their new bodies amen everything's been prefigured and foreshadowed in the scripture you just need the inspiration of the holy spirit right okay that's what that's where I wanted to go okay so in first Kings chapter 6 you're going to read about Soloman finishing and completing the temple but look at its 37 okay and 38 and 37 says in the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the Lord laid in the month zip okay and in this eleventh year so from the fourth year of Solomon's reign to the eleventh year seven years the Bible tells you that the temple was built in seven years that's like the seven churches right okay but I want you to notice what he says in verse 38 and in the eleventh year in the month bull which is the eighth the eighth month of the year the eleventh year of the reign you have a 8:11 like the last four verses of Revelations 10 8 to 11 because that is the temple of the Lord the bride is the temple now if you remember how program taught us the Temple of Solomon represents the body of Christ because the material that went into build Solomon's Temple was gathered from all over the world the stones that were they made and hone them stones there were some African stones huh there were some Indian stones there was there was some some Russian stones there I some Spanish and Latino stones is that right there was God from all over the world and that formed the temple is that right but the temple right here showing you that it was completed in the eighth month of the year and the 11th year Solomon's ring okay now when you go to chapter 8 you go to chapter 8 this whole thing on folks from verse 1 to verse 11 when the temple is being dedicated they bring the Ark of the Covenant into the temple right and it's in the seventh month that this is done and it's during the Feast of Tabernacles brother Branham said in future home that wonderful sermon that were worshiping now under the Feast of Tabernacles because Christ is entering into the tabernacle his bride and when you read revelations 10 8 to 11 what do you see the the word Christ entering into John so the words taken flesh and and endtime people the word goes from a one-man ministry until multiplied bride I don't understand why that's so hard for people jesus said except the corn of wheat dies it abides alone but if it dies it brings forth much fruit so Lord Jesus was the one man ministry he went into the grave and when he came out he came out multiplied they made all that anointed and all that Christ was he poured into the church and it was veiled behind the prophet but after the spoken word ministry why do you think his message against translated in all the other languages because Christ is multiplying his life through spoken word that's right that's how God multiplies his life is through spoken word Christ has multiplied his life in these last days to spoken word that's right and it's through the ministering and teaching of that that people become more and more conscience of these things right here this whole plans been laid out in the Bible do you think it's just a coincidence that they finished the temple and the eleventh year of his reign in the eighth month of the year read with me in first Kings chapter 8 it says in verse 2 and all the men of Israel assembled themselves together write unto King Solomon in the feast of the month F&M which is the seventh month right seventh church age somebody called us together right and all the elders of Israel came and the priests took up the ark right what was they gonna put the ark in the temple what is the Ark represent Jesus Christ brother branham taught us it was a box of wood overlaid with gold the wood represents your humanity flesh gold represents did see God from heaven so is a box of wood a man representing gold representing God such Jesus Christ as a god man so they bring the ark and they bring it into the temple which represents the bride and it has 8:11 connection like it's showing you in revelations 10 8 to 11 the word in it in the John this is the reality whether people want to admit it or not Christ was once veiled in a prophet now he's veiled and a multiply bride and in that bride body is a fivefold ministry to strengthen that body to nourish that body to minister to that body is that right that's hilarious when tape only people call me on the phone say brother Brent kid or brother Matthew can you tell me where brother Brent said this and explain this to me go listen to the tape if you're if you don't want no minister to help you I get the phone calls from tape only people brother Brando's my pastor and why you calling me that's right this friction of the Holy Spirit is what's needed it's the anointing of the Lord that's what's needed it we don't get nowhere it's the Holy Spirit I'm gonna read something for you out of the uncertain sound brother Brown was in the tavern and he tells the people I believe you wouldn't come to church hot today where we have to sit here and suffer under the heat just to be coming to church for the fun of coming I'm sorry brothers I didn't have this in my notes it's uncertain sound 55 July 31st paragraph 51 okay just to be coming to church for the fun of coming I believe there's a certain thing that you come for that is Christ amen did you come to feed on Christ today brother Brown says in verse 52 paragraph 52 and on certain sound 19:55 you never come to hear me although I may do the best I can but I can never draw anybody to God no one can draw it but Christ you come to hear the sing and perhaps the singing is very fine we like that kind of singing but singing doesn't draw people to Christ sing and don't draw people to Christ we got some good singers that I'm sorry ain't nothing against you singer folks but singing don't do it now check this out it's the Holy Spirit that draws people to Christ all right paragraph 54 preaching doesn't draw although we try the best we can pastor and I we do the very best to draw people to Christ or preach the gospel but it is the Holy Spirit who has to draw your heart and give you that certain sound we can preach the gospel what we think is right but it the Holy Spirit has to give the sound that echoes in your heart and there is a certain sound amen have you heard the sound of his voice today speaking in the innermost being of your soul is that right praise God for His grace is that right now watch how this connects up in the scripture because this is fantastic you have them dedicated in the temple in the seventh month first Kings chapter 8 but the temple was finished in the eighth month so when they finished the temple in the eighth month it was 11 months later when they dedicated it 8:11 because Christ is being portrayed here as inhabiting his bride the temple that Solomon built represents you it was finished in the seventh month and when you examine the whole chapter its verse 1 to 11 that the Ark is brought in then in verse 11 God fills the temple read verse 11 so that the priest could not stand a minister because of the cloud for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord and in verse 12 Solomon starts his prayer but it's chapter 8 1 to 11 see that's the second part of the mystery Christ and bride form he brought a message so vindicated prophet don't we love it but there's a reality and a maturing and a growth the bride's not afraid to read past verse seven the bride's not afraid to see herself in this word because they want you to stop at the prophet they want you to stop at Abraham sending their legs our Abraham sent LA's our Abraham sent la's our isn't there more to it than that a laser was sent to call out a bride from Babylon is that right but does the story stop there no I don't think so Rebekah went all the way to Isaac's tent is that right and they got together in a marriage union is that right so the object today is Christ in the union with his bride that's the Bible that's the scripture that's what the emphasis should be your soul and God so as one so he's teaching last night right first Corinthians 6 verse 17 but he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit oneness with Christ huh is that right now let me read for you this statement of the Prophet where he says that the temple was made of material from around the world if I can get my act together here it's a quotation that I thought I had in my notes maybe brother Joe can find it for me and put it up praise the Lord you get your mind going in a certain way amen it is the statement I know you are familiar with the right brother Graham says that the temple was made from material around the world right they brought all those things together to build a dwelling place for the ark the message has went through all the nations to call a bride to Christ the meeting place is not in a particular City it's not in a particular Church it's not under a particular Ministry of a one-man ministry it is in Christ God only has one place to meet you that's in Christ is it now what the profit stood for don't worship God in any Oh gate but the gate that I place my name and the name of God is placed in the word interpreted for the outer if you live in God's name was once represented by the Lutheran's because there was the voice of God for their day but they stopped speaking for God when they couldn't move on with the word is that right and people think today that they're speaking for God because they believe God sent a prophet the Pharisees believe God sent Moses all kind of people believe God sent a prophet in different ages and everything like that don't you think the devil believes God sent a prophet that prophet was anointed with the spear and power of Elijah the holy spirit and fullness of Christ and the devil God kits nine ways to Sunday that devil knows God sent a prophet and people in this age can know God sent a prophet and really don't do much for him hmm that's true all kind of people no God sent Moses cuz we got the Ten Commandments all right we got the Ten Commandments God sent Moses but the difference is you live by that word is that word expressing itself through you or have you become a written epistle read known of all men of the prophets message because we're taught that there's three Bibles the first bat was in the stars the second Bible was Enochs pyramid wrote in stone the third Bible is this right here sixty-six books of the Bible wrote by 40 different authors is God's thought expressed on page for you and I is that right but but the word don't stop there the final resting place of the word is always in flesh wasn't Jesus Christ the Living Word he's the Bible as the endtime bride to the Living Word he's the by it she's the Bible is that right this word is supposed to take spirit and life in flesh that's the revelation oh I want to say something real true spiritual revelation is you becoming conscience of the Word made flesh in the hour that you live in that's what real revelation is revelation is recognizing the word in flesh now the Holy Spirit anoints you to see things in the Bible I never saw this before this year how the 811 from revelations 10 8 to 11 is connected up then Solomon's Temple in different places of the word because the idea I hope you understand what I'm trying to preach the idea is Christ in the form of his bride and I've been seeing how that's been foreshadowed down through the Bible how after seven scores of spoke than a woman Hattie right it's a pattern after the seven churches messenger a bride age after the seven-day millennium the new heavens and the new earth you've been set to a pattern to walk in such a way and so conscience in God's power and God's economy he's fulfilling now what he's going to fulfill again in the future this is what faith is it's the mind of God thinking it starts through you and you're walking out the word in your day Christ is living his life out through you because the words reflecting through you does that make sense so do you see how in these last days Satan has gathered all of his powers through organization he mixes the false religion with the ikanai with the politics and war-making capability with the black horse which is economy he mixes all those three things together in a pale horse this endtime bride overcomes all of that this InTown Brides anointed overcome all those powers of the devil but false teaching and that white horse is still with us today Satan still rides the ride white horse because we're in said the white horse was the antichrist going forth in a teaching ministry then he Christ as a teacher because he's counterfeiting the Holy Spirit who is the inside teacher so the only way to combat the Antichrist teaching us have a real revelation of Jesus Christ and His Word and preach it true ministers need to be preaching more than ever you know what Satan's job is to always crop everything up around the true thing you go into a Christian bookstore they put a little bitty shelf for King James Version like then all the other perverted versions are all around that bookshelf after bookshelf he counterfeits the true then he multiplies it to drowned out the voice of the true bride you got more scallywags and more double-minded carnal minded people in the message today than ever but that don't mean there ain't a true bride somewhere in the midst of all that that's right people get so discouraged be like I don't know and then they just leave the message just because there's so much confusion and carnality and the churches don't mean there's not a real new birth they don't mean there's not a real Holy Ghost power that can take all kinds of things of the world from you amen don't be discouraged hold on to the promise see it in the work take the prophets message back to the Bible because it makes the Bible alive there's a quickening power that moves off of that into your life that enables you comforts you empowers you and gives you the mind of Christ you don't want to approach life no other way but with the mind of Christ trust me everything else is torment the uncertainty and not knowing torment so many people but the revelation of the word brings absolute faith it brings the absolute into our hearts day men so I just wanted to share some scriptures with you today that is really fantastic because the this chapter 10 8 to 11 if it is a prophetic truth in a revelation brother Branham taught us all scripture answers to Scripture and I'd love to point things out to people to show look how scriptural brother Rams thinking was brother Branham thought always in terms of Scripture and that's the way message people should be you can't hardly get message folks to read their Bible you should absolutely be in your Bible all the time the Prophet was is that right those gifts that operate in brother Browns life was to vindicate he had the authority from Christ to interpret scripture the interpretation of Scripture has done by Christ living it through you you become the interpretation of the Bible when the life of Christ takes hold in you and you begin to walk into divine consciousness amen so remember how we are saying that the temple is made up of material from around the world is that right and we know how that is reality in this story of Israel's history and I still can't find maybe that's what listen when they built the Temple of Solomon any of you Mason's here now could get this pretty good they brought the Cedars down from Lebanon they floated them in as far as Joppa and hauled them by ox cart and so forth you know then they cut out all their stones all around the world right stone upon stone didn't about didn't Bible say that your lively stones built up a spiritual house a holy habitation right now bring up the scripture Matthew 8:11 put up Matthew 8:11 for us check this out Matthew 8:11 says and I say unto you that many shall come from the east and west and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven come from all load of place 8:11 right and Genesis chapter 8 verse 11 it says then the Dove came into him in the evening time the language says that the languages not the Dove came on to him when you're reading about says the Dove came in to him in the evening time and lo her mouth was and in her mouth was an olive leaf sluggish she had a message in her mouth huh she had a message of peace Shalom in her mouth is that right and I've leaf tucked off so no one knew that the waters were abated from off the earth is that right but 8:11 the dove flew into him is there I so the ark is brought into Solomon's Temple in first Kings chapter 8 verse 1 to 11 Sara John is eating the book which is actually Christ the word in and into John in Revelations 10 8 to 11 is that right so go to Romans chapter 8 verse 11 Romans 8:11 you are to probably ought to quote that but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you it's all about Christ living in his bride Christ living in his people the Word made flesh seeing the prophets part is only just part of the program there's another part beyond that it's the bride's part because after Jesus was crucified his life was multiplied after God fills himself behind a prophet to reveal the Son of Man that is to be multiplied into people without that you don't have translating grapes or answering faith if Christ doesn't take if his word doesn't become flesh in you so you can see what has happened it's to keep the people's minds distracted with politics and debate and church when the reality is you should be working out your own salvation with fear and trembling you should be seeking and searching after the Lord to make your calling and election Shore to make sure that Christ is actually in your vessel amen so you can just go on and on with it and down through the Bible you go God's plan was always to in 12 man he said to Isaiah where is the place of my rest what house will you build on to me and where is the place of my rest but to this man will I look is that right and we heard last night in our Bible study that in Genesis 1 he was a spirit man but in Genesis 2 he was put in a temple God had a Feast of Tabernacles right there with Adam God tabernacled in a body right but when you read the passage it's in the Sabbath day Sabbath means rest God took rest when he entered into Adam that's the Sabbath what day of the week is the Sabbath seventh then what happened after that Eve came out went from a Sabbath day to a bride age riding the Garden of Eden is that right but in this glorious age when this Brides brought out right God had to open up Adam side bring forth Eve God had to open up Jesus side bring forth to alpha bride in these last days down comes Jesus with a book in his hand gives the mysteries out to a prophet the Prophet publicly speaks them out right the children of God with an ear to hear has been hearing what Christ is saying through that prophets message realize in her place in the plan of redemption and this Omega bride cannot fall like the alpha bride did like Eve did or Israel nobody that's the power of this our friend this endtime Brides predestinated to overcome everything now think about this by virtue of the fact that this is how it's pattern in the word this is the way you should believe it right if it's this way patterned out brother least that's the way we should expect it that's the way we should confess it that's the way we should live to it that's the way we should believe it the Alpha bride fell Eve fell Israel fell but there's something about this Omega bribed somebody identified to me what is it about this Omega bride that cannot fall how come she can't defy her skirts how come she can't fall short how come she can't be polluted and deluded how come the Antichrist can impregnate those other brides with this broad can't can you deal with it can you identify why do you understand how that's moving in your life do you know how that the womb has closed around the husband see today and same couldn't pregnant could not impregnate you if he tried they know false Antichrist teaching gonna be to pregnant this in time Brian that at all that's the power and the anointing and the reality of this age you should be understanding should be able to identify with that let me say it again calmly you have a historical fact that Brides fell Eve fell Israel fell Israel was Jehovah's bride she got corrupted pagan nations were just eating away paganism occultism evil spirits from the devil idolatry they was throwing their kids in the fire to a false God Moloch that was bound down the roots they was in all kinds of health Solomon set up golden horses in the temple for crying out loud in honor of false gods all that stuff was going on idolatry corrupted Israel that's why they went into a 70 year captivity is that right and when Jesus comes what are they all into Babylonian Talmud teaching for doctrines the commandments of men and making the Word of God of no effect all that influence was there and in these last days after seven church ages of the Gentiles you got tradition superstition denominationalism and organization all this Antichrist bunk but the Bible shows us God's gonna have a bride here without spot without wrinkle come out how does he achieve such a thing what's the details are you into it do you understand it do you see how it's been foreshadowed in the Bible well somebody here brother Bob has got to overcome all this Christ is the one doing it in his bride but there's a specific certain way there is a walk to walk there's a pattern there's something set it's specific it's outlined it's defined don't be so loose and you're thinking don't be so casual about the message young folks this is serious serious business spiritual scientists are working with things from the message from the Bible to put it together in these laboratories here to give you something to rise above the dread of this age that's right pay close attention to what the Spirit is saying through your ministry here watch and pray for the inspiration of the Spirit to flow freely to receive what Christ is saying I want to get ready to close but I want you to just encourage you I try to encourage people about this everywhere I go it's very simple but it's it's important in your personal private life spend time seeking the Lord pray and read your Bible don't just listen to a message to get finished with it listen carefully or read slowly and meditate I'm trying to teach my children my family about Christian meditation it's not how many chapters of the Bible you read it's not the quantity it's the quality what are you extracted from it how is it speaking to your life do you understand that's why Christian Fellowship is important the Lord inspires you about something we share the Lord inspires me about something we share not just ministers everybody should be into Christ who's your favorite person anyway huh my favorite person is Uncle Joe Bob your favorite person better be Jesus but Uncle Joe Bob gives me a dollar every time he comes to the house huh Jesus gives eternal life your favorite person better not be some flesh-and-blood person to better be Jesus you should be seeking after him he can be found knock and it shall be open seeking you'll find asking it shall be given your prophet said just don't knock gonna say oh well Lord I guess and walk away brother and said knock and keep on knockin be persistent be perseverance right so when you spend time with the Lord and this should be happening in between church services right poor old people today are so beat up and so drugged up don't even think about anything has to do with God so they walk in church here we are it's time to do to God thing again if that's your attitude you need to repent seek the Lord in your personal private life you'll find as you draw nigh to God God will draw nigh to you and inspire you friends don't tell you how it works Lee last night today I was meditating in Luke chapter 12 I know I'm supposed to bring the text out of that chapter what was read this morning Luke chapter 12 that happens all the time my song leader will be singing the songs that I got notes here and I'm getting ready to preach its continuity of the Spirit if you can get in that channel of inspiration you can hear what God's and you find things in your heart you're meditating on God and you when you think and you pray and you ask questions well lo and behold you come to church and if the pastor don't get anointed to speak the very thing that you got going on in your heart then you know that's God speaking amen praise the Lord God bless you today how many understands what I've been sharing with you today the brides part amen amen so the Lord's will and we'll get into a few more things like that the Lord just has me recognized the continuity of these things and it's really just so scriptural this message message folks should understand their Bible better than anybody listen what brother branch says about this bride in church age book in the ephesian church age part of the book real fashionable clothes he says seven golden candlesticks in Exodus 20:5 31 it says endow shout make a candlestick of pure gold that's the bride he's talking about now of beaten work the bride's bleeding right in the other place in the church area brother Brad said this image will try to stop her ministers from teaching and preaching and given comfort to the people who's trying to stop the bride from preaching the bride don't need to be stopped read revelations 10 8 to 11 oh excuse me maybe you stopped at verse 7 you ain't got the clue huh the Lord told the bride thou must prophesy that's right she's got something she's got to say census knows that he's speaking out of her mouth but if you ain't got an ear to hear maybe you can't hear what Jesus is speaking to his bride today oh I just pressed play I bet you 99% of the people that just press play still in hearing what Jesus is saying you got to have the Holy Ghost with your press and play and hear they got the Holy Ghost thing you got the love of God then you got discernment and the mind of Christ you can hear what God saying to a pastor or to a tape you better hear the voice of Jesus Christ huh that's right anything about Jesus anything about him hearing the voice of the bridegroom so you need to pray for your pastor amen so Christ can flow and channel himself through the ministry and you catch continuity in the speaking and inspiration of the Holy Ghost so he says the beaten work shall the candlestick be made his shaft and his branches his bows his knobs and his flowers shall be the same the true Church of Jesus Christ the bride is likened to pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him and what he is she is to reflect and what he has she is to manifest there is no fault in her Amen what he has she is to manifest there's no fault in her she is all glorious within and without from beginning to end and she is the work of her Lord and all his works are perfect in fact in her is summed up and manifested the eternal wisdom and purpose of God I believe that's the answer I was looking for I said Lord why is it in the Bible that wisdom has always referred to as a
