[4:29] had a good time this past weekend with a
[4:31] fellowship meeting brother Ernie
[4:33] ministering for us and and I also pray
[4:36] for him as he travels along ok first
[4:38] Peter 1 going to verse 18 for as much as
[4:49] you know that you were not redeemed with
[4:51] corruptible things as silver and gold
[4:54] from your vain conversation received by
[4:57] tradition from your father's but with
[4:59] the precious blood of Christ as it a
[5:01] lamb as of a lamb without blemish and
[5:04] without spot Hoover lee was foreordained
[5:07] before the foundation of the world but
[5:10] was manifest in these last times for you
[5:12] who by him do believe in God that raised
[5:16] him from the dead and gave him glory and
[5:21] that your faith and hope might be in God
[5:23] seeing you how purified your souls and
[5:26] obeying the truth through the spirit
[5:27] unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see
[5:31] if you love one another with pure with a
[5:32] pure heart fervently being born again
[5:36] not of corruptible seed but of
[5:39] incorruptible by the Word of God which
[5:42] liveth and abideth forever now to me
[5:45] there's only one thing that there's no
[5:49] way to corrupt it and that is the word
[5:51] you said well look what they've done no
[5:53] they didn't corrupt the word
[5:56] you can't corrupt the word now your
[5:59] thoughts and ideas can provide all of
[6:01] what you're thinking and confuse people
[6:04] which you can't mess with that word it's
[6:07] forever settled okay now then that way
[6:10] we can stand on it
[6:11] second Peter one Simon Peter a servant
[6:13] an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that
[6:16] have obtained like precious faith with
[6:17] us through the righteousness of God and
[6:19] our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace
[6:23] be multiplied unto you through the
[6:24] knowledge of God and oh Jesus our Lord
[6:28] according as his divine power have given
[6:31] unto us all things that pertain unto
[6:34] life and godliness through the knowledge
[6:36] of him that have called us to glory and
[6:38] virtue whereby are given unto us
[6:41] exceeding great and precious promises
[6:43] that by these you might be partakers of
[6:46] the divine nature having escaped the
[6:49] corruption that is in the world through
[6:50] lust and beside this giving all
[6:53] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[6:55] to virtue knowledge you may be seated
[6:58] the Lord added his blessing to the
[7:02] reading of the word now we've reached
[7:05] kind of a place and you know I've been
[7:09] heading toward this for months in the
[7:12] message but we reached a place that the
[7:16] we're going to have to make our own
[7:19] commitments you know within ourselves
[7:24] you know to find out and see what we
[7:28] believe and see the words the truth or
[7:30] what it is time is fastly running out we
[7:33] don't have enough time to start over and
[7:37] try to do anything we've got to move on
[7:41] in God all right now I've always taught
[7:45] you to believe it that you can take the
[7:49] Bible and make it say what you want it
[7:55] to say now you take it you make it it
[8:00] doesn't change the wording right
[8:04] and all of doctrines in the world is
[8:06] only one Bible there's not all not a
[8:09] thousand different Bibles there's one
[8:11] Bible that mankind has taken that Bible
[8:14] and you can prove anything you want to
[8:17] by pulling out quotes you know thoughts
[8:24] and make it say what you want it to say
[8:27] you can take this message and do the
[8:31] thing at the same time and you can make
[8:33] it say anything you want it to say but
[8:37] it don't change the letter of the word
[8:40] the word is there it's it's dark you
[8:43] know to be studied and you know but you
[8:46] can make it according to your thinking
[8:49] applied to anything you want it to be
[8:53] all right now that has caused in a vast
[8:58] difference in the people of the message
[9:01] all right and then like I gave you the
[9:05] quote where brother Branham said the
[9:07] baptism of the Holy Ghost had been so
[9:09] incorrectly talks that they had about
[9:11] 900 different ways of seeing it of one
[9:15] little thought or an idea how about in
[9:19] the message and all of the people and
[9:20] the thoughts of the people of this
[9:22] message and you know anything you say to
[9:27] me I don't mean this wrong what I mean
[9:29] it's it's the way it is done that you
[9:34] can take and make a quote you can pull a
[9:37] quote you can pull it out and you can
[9:40] run real good with it you know and try
[9:43] to make something say what you want it
[9:45] to say but now the Bible doesn't say but
[9:48] one thing there's one faith one Lord one
[9:52] baptism right all right now in the
[9:56] message there's one message what it's
[10:04] laid out the way it's supposed to be and
[10:07] you can't question why a prophet would
[10:11] say things in a certain way
[10:15] I said a certain way now I don't say
[10:17] saying it wrong now I know years ago
[10:20] some of them said what c-virus did you
[10:23] know the Prophet said he's too many
[10:26] following the message so he come up with
[10:28] something doc no you can't do that not
[10:30] to run people all that's not God in his
[10:32] wife he just comes on the scene and by
[10:36] coming on the scene contrary to mankind
[10:38] he'll automatically confuse mankind
[10:40] right so you can take the message you
[10:44] can make it say what you want it to say
[10:46] and you can can prove your point as I
[10:51] said by oh I've got these quotes I've
[10:53] got this I remember one brother said one
[10:57] time he said I told my wife said I only
[10:59] got about 2,000 quotes on this I don't
[11:01] know where to preach it or not well it's
[11:05] not quotes there's only one revelation
[11:09] in the Bible that's the revelation of
[11:12] Jesus Christ all right there's only one
[11:14] revelation in this message and that's
[11:17] the revelation of Jesus Christ okay
[11:20] now we may pervert twist turn do
[11:23] whatever we do with it to make it say
[11:26] what we want it to say try to prove our
[11:30] point with it
[11:31] but remember we'll answer for the things
[11:34] that we do in any form of that way okay
[11:40] now in in talking like that I'm trying
[11:43] to get you to think about something
[11:45] because you know I have my ministry has
[11:51] always seemed to be the I don't know how
[11:56] to explain it but it's always been in
[11:58] that realm that what was has been
[12:01] confusing to the people you know it's
[12:05] always seemed to be something within me
[12:09] wants to express it and try to get it
[12:14] correct you know and you say well
[12:16] everybody wants to do that I know
[12:18] problems I'm not saying that I'm just
[12:20] saying that the things that other
[12:22] ministers would not tackle or bring out
[12:25] into the open
[12:28] then you know that this seems to be my
[12:32] ministry that - worth it
[12:33] that I want it to be right because I
[12:36] believe it's right
[12:37] I believe there's just one faith one
[12:40] Lord one baptism
[12:42] I believe there's just one message that
[12:44] the Prophet has brought them to us but
[12:48] yet look at the splits the pools the
[12:50] divisions and the things and everybody
[12:52] says we say what he says and you know to
[12:56] the degree that's true
[12:58] you know there's I say in our moment ago
[13:01] where the Prophet said there's 900
[13:02] different ways of seeing the baptism of
[13:04] the Holy Ghost by mankind
[13:06] you realize each one of them has so much
[13:08] word each one out of 900 they have so
[13:14] much word it may be a small amount but
[13:18] still they have so much word all right
[13:21] and see then you can't just lay it on
[13:23] well well I got this quarter I got that
[13:25] one all right
[13:27] see then the way I do is when I see
[13:30] something that looks contrary I won't
[13:34] approach that until I see it in a
[13:37] satisfaction maybe okay no problem you
[13:40] know I don't claim to be the only pebble
[13:42] on the beach I mean they were a group
[13:43] they're worried about it I just hope I
[13:45] hope I'm on the beach the pebbles ain't
[13:48] worried about all right but I've always
[13:51] just said looked at something and said
[13:53] well okay now if there's so much wrong
[13:56] about this surely there's a truth some
[14:01] work you know if there's so much wrong
[14:04] well we don't need to know this we don't
[14:06] need to know that that's what I was
[14:08] making this statement the other night
[14:10] you know the other day about it I asked
[14:12] you a simple question how do we get the
[14:16] virtues we say well it's the opening of
[14:21] the word all right I hope you hold that
[14:22] point for a little bit opening of the
[14:24] word all right I believe that that's
[14:26] exactly what it is but the Prophet said
[14:31] 3:27 church age book this messenger of
[14:34] Malachi 4:2 Luke 1730 would do two
[14:36] things one turn ogress or the children
[14:38] back to the faith of the fathers to
[14:39] reveal the thunders which was a
[14:41] revelation contained in the seven seals
[14:43] and he said it would be these divinely
[14:44] revealed mystery truths that literally
[14:46] turn our hearts back all right darted me
[14:50] is the key that's the key that I've
[14:51] always preached since about nineteen and
[14:53] eighty when the Lord showed me that from
[14:57] the scriptures of DARS the key if you
[14:59] want to know how to get to virtues you
[15:02] got to go to the seals well I don't
[15:07] think you need to know about to seal
[15:08] well how are you gonna get diverges if
[15:12] that statement is true now I mean simple
[15:15] as that statement if it's true if the
[15:17] Prophet meant that if he said that and
[15:24] he meant that see then we have no right
[15:28] to question and like I asked how many
[15:32] people has even read a sealed book all
[15:36] the way through the biggest problem is
[15:43] is the ones that ain't even ever read it
[15:46] - ooh can you tell you all about it you
[15:51] know I mean argue were you like crazy
[15:55] and they ain't even never read the book
[15:58] well see but that person is popular
[16:01] because they have an argumentative point
[16:05] of trying to make their point so we
[16:06] don't have to understand well now why is
[16:09] it in the Bible to understand I mean I
[16:15] thought one of the virtues was knowledge
[16:17] I thought it was whether or not acts
[16:20] 2:38 contradicted Matthew 28:19
[16:23] I thought that was the kind of knowledge
[16:25] if you understand what I'm saying
[16:29] see we can take it and make it say what
[16:32] we want it to say well I think if God
[16:37] wants me to have them things here let's
[16:38] give them to me yeah I know how to quote
[16:43] a little bit of that I know where the
[16:44] quote is there that if God's obligated
[16:48] to give us the word and that if it's
[16:51] needed he'll put somebody on the pulpit
[16:53] to bring that word I know I know what
[16:57] the message says but what if the person
[16:59] he puts on the pulpit is bringing what
[17:03] we have need of but yet we don't know
[17:06] that's what we need and see that way
[17:11] then it's always to work that people
[17:13] think well you're just trying to be this
[17:15] you're trying to be that no I'm trying
[17:17] to do one thing I want to know we've
[17:22] been here 50 years since we're leaving
[17:24] of the Prophet I mean what's gonna
[17:31] happen well we got to figure it out this
[17:36] way though okay I pray to God that
[17:39] something will happen very quickly you
[17:43] know because if not then you know a lot
[17:48] of us is getting too old to try to worry
[17:50] about it tomorrow
[17:51] we better be worried about the rest of
[17:53] the night right you know when you when
[17:57] you pace that 70 mark you're downhill
[18:01] and you quit thinking about anything
[18:03] future and you start trying to think
[18:08] about what was the paste then after a
[18:10] while you get to the vices you can't
[18:13] remember and when you can't remember
[18:15] where you're at he saw you silly well
[18:18] that's true but it's true and you know
[18:22] no but listen Church all I'm trying to
[18:27] say is one thing that to me the Bible
[18:33] the message on the Bible and the message
[18:37] shows one revelation I've never believed
[18:43] it would not be a body of Christ to say
[18:45] everybody has got the same little parts
[18:48] you know or whatever you want to say it
[18:50] wouldn't be a body of Christ I've never
[18:53] taught nothing like that quarter don't
[18:54] believe it and I never have believed it
[18:57] it's only at Lula I've never taught
[19:01] nothing like that I believe it's around
[19:02] the world you know and around the world
[19:08] God is dealing with his bride I'm just
[19:13] interested in finding out I got a little
[19:15] note the other day on something that I'm
[19:17] I'm really going to give some emphasis
[19:18] because you know it came through and and
[19:22] and I read it and you know the man's got
[19:27] a real good talks about the new birth I
[19:31] want to find out some more about it of
[19:35] what he's saying because from what I
[19:38] read I couldn't find anything wrong with
[19:39] it well if you can read a whole lot like
[19:42] I did it's a full book it's about 70
[19:44] something pages and I'm interested in
[19:49] hearing what somebody else has to say
[19:52] because I've always believed one time
[19:55] faith don't come by preaching now
[20:00] somebody's got a priest you understand
[20:02] get the point but faith that doesn't say
[20:05] comes by preaching it says faith comes
[20:07] by hearing right that's why did I've
[20:12] never understood the people about it
[20:14] color you know they say tongues is
[20:15] evidence well it was never tongues
[20:18] it was the hearing right it was the
[20:24] hearing not to talk not to speaking you
[20:27] know I don't get to help but that's
[20:29] alright but still think about it so
[20:32] you'll see what I'm trying to drive that
[20:34] I've told you what I believe I went
[20:38] through it this past Wednesday I kind of
[20:41] covered all the way through covering
[20:44] into seeing what to expect and what to
[20:47] do you know and and and I believe the
[20:52] message is right
[20:55] all right but I believe that if you
[20:58] don't make a statement see that's
[21:01] working mostly ministers they won't well
[21:04] I believe it but didn't you tunne say
[21:06] something they just kind of they kind of
[21:08] bounced around you know a little bit
[21:10] they don't want to just be put right on
[21:12] that spot that's why I've always say it
[21:15] I believe in one true and living God I
[21:21] believe in water baptism in the name of
[21:25] the Lord Jesus Christ I believe the
[21:29] things of the Bible is true all right
[21:32] and I don't mind putting my life behind
[21:35] that point of interest to say that's
[21:40] what I believe you saw brother Dale what
[21:42] do you believe you you asked a lot of
[21:45] people why they believe you're gonna get
[21:46] a bypass answer or a halfway answer or I
[21:50] don't know answer or some kind of
[21:52] something but you ask me I'm gonna tell
[21:54] you you know now if you don't want to
[21:58] know don't ask me because when you ask
[22:01] me I'm gonna tell you what I believe to
[22:03] the tee because that's what I believe I
[22:08] want it I want to be honest and sincere
[22:10] with you the word at least when it comes
[22:13] to the last days and we're all standing
[22:15] there I want it to be whether or not
[22:17] that I tried to help you to get to that
[22:21] place is my desire all right and see
[22:25] then in doing it just like I said or any
[22:27] face 900 different ways of seeding the
[22:31] baptism of the Holy Ghost all right then
[22:36] I think it's serious matter for us to
[22:38] find out what is the baptism of the Holy
[22:40] Ghost you know what the truth is but I
[22:46] can take the Bible and the Prophet and
[22:49] make it say anything you want it to say
[22:53] about the baptism
[22:58] but that's no good but it's true you
[23:04] ought to know it's true and when I look
[23:06] at his things I look at it and when I'm
[23:09] reading and studying it now I'm looking
[23:14] at what I believe will be helpful for me
[23:19] and you all right and you say well
[23:24] brother Brown said this brother Dale why
[23:27] did he say this why did he say that
[23:29] well I at least want to be able to be
[23:33] familiar of what you're saying
[23:35] you know to study that thought and then
[23:40] wait on the Lord to try to get an answer
[23:42] don't claim all the answers but at least
[23:45] I'll study the thought to try to get the
[23:49] right answer because my concern is you
[23:52] you know and I don't have to worry about
[23:56] it because I'm like what brother around
[23:57] him said and I love that point he said
[23:59] don't matter where I preach or not he
[24:01] said I'm saved
[24:02] and that don't have nothing to do with
[24:04] it I'm not preaching to try to get saved
[24:07] I'm not preaching to try to go to heaven
[24:11] that's already saddled what I'm
[24:15] preaching to try to help somebody else
[24:17] you know to where they can I thought we
[24:21] believed in Christianity was living for
[24:22] others I thought that was the point of
[24:24] eternal life was to live for others and
[24:26] and trying to do like that and in doing
[24:29] it then trying to help all right
[24:32] and see then we're heading now to in the
[24:38] next message the Lord willing probably
[24:41] the next or the next somewhere right in
[24:44] there we're going to start dealing in
[24:47] the message that was taught by the
[24:49] Prophet that was called adoption all
[24:53] right so if you want to read a lot in
[24:56] those times there's one book dard it's
[24:58] got four in it you know the different
[25:01] things of adoption you want to read that
[25:03] listen to the message here um there's
[25:06] about 20 or 30 of them listen to the
[25:09] hose whatever you can do
[25:12] I'm asked sometimes with what should I
[25:13] read or study all right read real
[25:16] careful Romans 8 read it over and over
[25:21] and over to you well familiar with it
[25:23] read Galatians 3 and 4
[25:27] especially Galatians 4 that when you
[25:30] come in to your tutors and you go of
[25:32] nursing or different things read those
[25:34] things and you'll be familiar with it
[25:36] and then when you do you'll understand
[25:39] why I'm saying this or that or the other
[25:42] about it because we try to follow what
[25:47] was brought to us by the Prophet we've
[25:53] got what he says but it's not a jumbled
[25:56] up mess of an argument from one to the
[25:59] other you know it's the truth and I
[26:04] admit that sometimes you got to wait a
[26:08] long time to find the right answer you
[26:13] know I don't have no problems with that
[26:16] you know you ever heard right around
[26:19] said he wouldn't preach on hell and
[26:20] talitha till he found out what it was
[26:22] you know until it was revealed to him he
[26:26] wouldn't preach well I've held off many
[26:29] a thing that I wouldn't preach on
[26:30] because I didn't have a clear
[26:32] understanding and then sometimes you
[26:36] have to move out into realms to get
[26:41] understandings you know and wait on the
[26:44] Lord then as of what to do and we spent
[26:47] quite a while talking about salvation
[26:53] talking about how this on vote unveiled
[26:56] before us - all the way through the Old
[26:59] Testament come into the New Testament
[27:01] then with it and we start now on the day
[27:04] of Pentecost speaking about the new
[27:07] birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost all
[27:10] right now I have made myself clear and
[27:13] straight of what I believe about the new
[27:16] birth
[27:18] okay we've taken some things that
[27:20] brother branham has said that you could
[27:24] take those things and make him say what
[27:28] you wanted him to say you know and just
[27:32] do what you want to be could twist it
[27:34] but trying not to - but trying to
[27:36] believe it and trying to accept him why
[27:39] he would say it all right as I was
[27:43] bringing our moment ago
[27:44] I don't believe brother branham you know
[27:47] he said there's too many following this
[27:48] message all right but did he
[27:52] deliberately go out and catch up a
[27:54] doctrine or an idea to try to confuse
[27:57] people or did he just go on with the
[27:59] truth I believe he went on with the
[28:02] truth I don't believe he had to worry
[28:04] about none of it yeah he didn't have to
[28:06] make up something you can't have the
[28:09] Prophet you can have God deliberately
[28:12] blinding the eyes of people without a
[28:14] day of grace to be given there has to be
[28:19] a grace to be given like the field field
[28:21] you yeah God blinded the eyes are those
[28:24] shoes where we could be brought in but
[28:26] he's going to give him eternal holiday
[28:29] okay see then he's wonder what bringing
[28:34] the grace all right
[28:36] I've talked to you in this series over
[28:41] and over one thing that I believe and
[28:46] then we're going to make some statements
[28:48] when we get to the end of the message
[28:49] didn't hide a little bit that's gonna
[28:51] sound contrary to what I've said well
[28:56] let's wait and see you know find out
[29:01] what God has to say about the situation
[29:05] could I believe that your new birth
[29:09] according to the Prophet starts when you
[29:12] believe didn't say complete it didn't
[29:20] say it was done he just said it stars
[29:22] when you believe because everything's
[29:25] got to start when you believe
[29:27] huh accepting Jesus Christ as your
[29:31] Savior believing in him that starts your
[29:36] Christian journey better known as
[29:40] repentance our justification you know
[29:44] whatever you want to bring it to the
[29:46] point of see you believing and then when
[29:51] it comes to the day of the quickening of
[29:56] what you believe if that's right it'll
[29:59] bring forth of birth when that word that
[30:03] you've received is quickened or made
[30:06] alive it'll bring forth a birth unto you
[30:09] all right see then I believe the new
[30:13] birth the being born again according to
[30:18] Jesus and John 3 you must be born again
[30:23] I believe it takes justification st.
[30:28] case the baptismal goes to make the new
[30:30] birth it takes justification
[30:34] sanctification baptism with hold ago to
[30:36] make the born-again experience to be
[30:41] into reality then it takes the baptism
[30:48] of the Holy Ghost to seal all of that
[30:50] off then I believe the new birth the
[30:57] baptism of the Holy Ghost and being born
[30:59] again it's one in the same it's not one
[31:04] thing coming out to make away for
[31:06] another where do we get to that one when
[31:08] the Prophet says it and he quotes to
[31:11] Charles fuller and somebody else and he
[31:13] said I didn't never know that anybody
[31:15] else believed like I did he makes a
[31:18] statement there that his sounds like he
[31:20] don't even believe what in the world
[31:22] he's taught yet we believe it's the
[31:30] truth but I can take the prophets
[31:34] message and the Bible
[31:37] and try to show you the new birth is
[31:40] this something over here or the
[31:41] born-again is something here or the
[31:43] baptism is something here but why would
[31:50] it be any different if the new birth is
[31:56] justification same case in the baptism
[31:59] of the old God
[32:00] if the born-again experience is
[32:02] justification sanctification the baptism
[32:05] in the Holy Spirit
[32:06] if the baptism of the Holy Spirit is the
[32:09] baptism in the Holy Spirit and we don't
[32:11] have to - you remember that quote we
[32:14] don't to have have two baptisms of the
[32:16] Holy Spirit prophet said there's only
[32:19] one Holy Spirit yeah but there's no no
[32:23] no don't try to jump on anointed one to
[32:25] try to make it to different spirit it's
[32:27] the same spirit I didn't teach you -
[32:31] anyway your prophet did it's the same
[32:35] Holy Spirit it's just according to
[32:38] what's on the interior part that could
[32:41] be quickened we're the anointed one is
[32:44] on your spirit but it's still the same
[32:46] Holy Spirit may I quote the Prophet the
[32:52] Holy Spirit the baptism of those quicken
[32:54] or justifies you it sanctifies you and
[32:58] then the baptism is the Holy Spirit the
[33:02] very person itself see then you can pull
[33:07] anything apart to make it say what you
[33:10] want and it sounds like that sometimes
[33:14] even the Prophet
[33:19] doesn't have understanding and listen I
[33:23] do believe honestly he groped in Grayson
[33:26] knowledge I do but then once he begins
[33:30] to make his statements once he settled
[33:36] down on something from then on that
[33:39] statement is correct you may have
[33:42] something to fight with or argue with as
[33:44] to dis and I believe he said this and I
[33:47] believe he said that but I thought it
[33:50] was to be one message and one
[33:55] understanding and see then it would fit
[34:00] all the way see that way you don't have
[34:04] to worry about even just you believing
[34:07] on the Lord Jesus Christ without it
[34:10] coming to eternal life you realize when
[34:14] you come to the white throne judgment
[34:15] you have something to help you that God
[34:19] could then give you eternal life because
[34:22] of your confession while you was on
[34:24] earth so don't stop we went through
[34:27] messages of that right we went through
[34:31] things to try to bring it to something
[34:33] and with the last few messages we've
[34:35] dwelt heavily on that what is the new
[34:38] birth
[34:41] it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's
[34:44] the Spirit of God baptizing you into the
[34:47] body and it's a revelation of Jesus
[34:53] Christ
[34:55] right it's a revelation of Jesus Christ
[34:59] I didn't give these to the brothers he's
[35:03] on one but I didn't give him so I'll
[35:05] just read him often but listen in the
[35:10] church age book 144 you remember we were
[35:13] giving this and we're talking about the
[35:15] you talking about the different things
[35:16] and he says now people say that
[35:18] receiving Christ is being born again all
[35:21] right now to receive Christ is to
[35:26] receive His Spirit to receive his Spirit
[35:29] is to be born again
[35:32] well to receive the spiritually baptized
[35:36] with the Holy Ghost
[35:43] why can't we believe it that away look
[35:46] what he says on that was paragraph 144
[35:50] let me get it 154 no go on tell okay
[35:56] 154 somewhere in church a church what is
[36:00] the baptism with the Holy Spirit
[36:01] it's the spirit baptizing you into the
[36:04] body of Christ it is the new birth it is
[36:07] the Spirit of God coming in and filling
[36:08] you after you've repented having heard
[36:11] the word when baptized in water huh
[36:14] so what's he saying what is the baptism
[36:16] when holder it's a spirit baptized into
[36:19] the body it's the new Bond he's saying
[36:24] here that you receive Christ who
[36:26] received Christ to be born again to
[36:29] receive the spirit is to be baptized
[36:31] with the Holy Ghost see then why
[36:35] wouldn't we accept our that to me see
[36:38] makes it to work I can say this is what
[36:41] I believe and it's up to you to decide
[36:46] what you believe I've never tried to
[36:49] convince nobody I've never tried to
[36:50] convince my family or anything and I can
[36:55] - daughter-in-law sitting back there our
[36:57] son-in-law you asked them if I ever
[36:59] tried to overload them with them what I
[37:01] believe as a matter of fact I'm in the
[37:05] opposite direction right I got $2 long
[37:11] shaking their head I don't know where
[37:12] the son-in-law is you in the back room
[37:13] oh yes but those two daughter-in-laws
[37:15] will tell you I've never tried to
[37:17] influence them about it
[37:21] I'll answer their questions yes but I
[37:25] never try to influence I've never tried
[37:26] to influence my wife I've never tried to
[37:29] influence my boys or the kids the
[37:31] grandkids reason I want them to make
[37:34] their own decision but I want them to
[37:38] have an opportunity now by I didn't run
[37:43] them all over the country and take them
[37:45] to all kind of places and everything
[37:47] else you know to let their minds get
[37:49] infiltrated with doctrines and ideas I
[37:51] didn't do that that's up to you and your
[37:54] children you're raising your children
[37:57] let's see I'm just saying it that way go
[38:01] be careful what you're taking your
[38:02] children's to here children to here well
[38:06] there and they they they believe the
[38:08] truth over here well some of you have
[38:11] come back and told me that they didn't
[38:13] believe it too much huh okay I'll take
[38:15] your word for it cuz I wasn't there but
[38:18] now listen season I believe that no man
[38:25] can come as the scripture says to Jesus
[38:29] Christ without the father draw on him
[38:33] and that no man can call Jesus the
[38:36] Christ except it be by the baptism of
[38:39] the Holy Spirit not to just say it
[38:43] anointing come on mind spirit in me say
[38:46] it that's still not correct even though
[38:49] it might be the baptism of the Holy
[38:51] Spirit may not you know baby the genuine
[38:53] what I'm talking about something from an
[38:55] inward experience why do you believe
[38:59] what you believe you've got to have your
[39:05] own personal experience that's wild well
[39:08] so heavily from cross the mystery on the
[39:11] message of what did the prophets say
[39:13] what is the new birth brother branham
[39:15] it's a revelation of Jesus Christ
[39:17] personally to you it's not written to
[39:24] everybody it's written to those that are
[39:27] in Christ Jesus it opens up to you
[39:31] because you have accepted Christ and
[39:35] seeing that then it's a revelation I've
[39:39] tried to emphasize that over and over
[39:41] though we say well brother Dale I didn't
[39:43] get no revelation when I got born again
[39:46] what was what was he doing I mean come
[39:53] on did you just walk in church I want to
[39:55] be born again they told me I need to do
[39:58] this I need to do that I need set Creed
[40:00] I need speaking tongues I need to shout
[40:01] I need to let me do what I got to do so
[40:03] let me just be saved now that ain't
[40:06] according to Scripture now that kind of
[40:08] confession
[40:09] I'd say you didn't get the new birth
[40:12] they worried about it because it's not
[40:15] on that basis if God is calling you
[40:21] he'll call you through somebody right no
[40:28] I got his voice out of heaven yeah you
[40:31] never had been to church and heard
[40:32] nothing I guess
[40:33] okay do you know what I'm talking about
[40:37] it's true
[40:38] somebody brought to you a truth and
[40:41] you've seen that truth and they began to
[40:43] burden you and as it did that's God
[40:46] calling you and then when he when you
[40:51] accept him as your Savior and he accepts
[40:54] you brother Branham said he gives you
[40:57] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and said
[40:59] if you're not accepted of God he won't
[41:02] give it to you so then it could be a
[41:09] young child what what does it say in
[41:11] Christ the mystery to the most
[41:12] illiterate person here give me a young
[41:16] child but they don't know what that
[41:18] means
[41:20] that's why people don't understand you
[41:22] when you say it when you read something
[41:24] to the people they but I didn't get a
[41:26] revelation they don't think about what
[41:29] revelation is they what they think
[41:32] you're saying is and there's in no way
[41:34] am I saying it or you know do you know
[41:37] about the seals you know about the file
[41:38] you know about the plague go over to the
[41:39] over there you ever got a revelation
[41:40] each time well I doubt were you born
[41:43] again cause you ain't got that now I
[41:44] ain't never talked nothing like that and
[41:46] I'm against that and any of these
[41:48] ministers gets up here and start telling
[41:50] it that way you'll find me in a hurry
[41:52] saying hey back off because it can't be
[41:56] something like that
[41:59] it's God dealing personally with you he
[42:07] doesn't deal the same with any you know
[42:11] what he deals different with each one of
[42:13] us but can you remember when something
[42:17] begins to working in within you and you
[42:22] begin to feel different
[42:23] we call it coming under conviction we
[42:27] call it reaching the age of
[42:29] accountabilities we call it no sign but
[42:33] it's God calling you if you answer that
[42:37] call he can give you eternal life
[42:42] there's the revelation see we think it's
[42:48] got to be some revelation some great big
[42:50] thing no it's the most simple thing that
[42:54] there is is accepting Jesus Christ as
[42:57] your Savior and then when he accepts you
[43:04] he'll give you the new birth and that
[43:08] new birth is a revelation of Jesus
[43:10] Christ that maybe the church he was in
[43:15] never taught nothing about Jesus Christ
[43:20] you know not a whole lot about it maybe
[43:22] they didn't teach the way the truth of
[43:25] it is but still God can bypass every bit
[43:27] of it and go right down into that heart
[43:30] and speak to that person and convict
[43:35] them then got them right you remember
[43:42] well see I'm not doing away with your
[43:44] experience I'm believing your experience
[43:52] because everybody's experience would be
[43:55] the same experience and I believe that
[43:57] way codasyl revelations Jesus Christ
[43:59] but it's degreed two different ways and
[44:02] thoughts and ideas
[44:06] you'll get far tonight I wanted to go on
[44:08] bender something if I do I'll just jump
[44:10] them in it take off what did brother
[44:14] branham say about this being born again
[44:21] we went to spoken word as regional seed
[44:24] paragraph 151 and then to 161 where
[44:27] brother Brown is talking about the birth
[44:29] of the word is Christ and how God took
[44:37] that word and planted it and the Holy
[44:41] Ghost coming quickened it all right Road
[44:51] ran him on paragraph 161 of spoken words
[44:53] at Regionals see he says now one of them
[44:57] that's the one in the tube so he said it
[45:00] brings you right back again unto the
[45:03] place where you should have been at the
[45:06] beginning you mean that that simple
[45:14] little new birth that you receiving
[45:19] eternal life by accepting Jesus Christ
[45:22] as your Savior brings you back like you
[45:27] should have been in the beginning like
[45:30] you was in the beginning we went through
[45:33] all of that right Adam and Eve had
[45:35] eternal life in their soul the new birth
[45:39] brings you eternal life into your soul
[45:42] that's the way you should have come to
[45:44] start with this is one we didn't give
[45:49] but a random says let me let me read
[45:53] this one we didn't read it they don't
[45:56] have to pull it up I'll get it when
[45:59] spoken word is reading the seed
[46:00] paragraph 2 16 through to 18 he said you
[46:05] were supposed to be here in the right
[46:08] way at the beginning now listen your
[46:11] prophet but being that you come the way
[46:14] you did you're subject to the following
[46:17] but being that you're predestined
[46:20] did you hear the word it brings you
[46:23] right back where you were predestinated
[46:26] Amen now listen what he said never saw
[46:30] that before he saw something he'd never
[46:35] saw before that's what he said
[46:38] brings you what what makes you believe
[46:41] the Word of God and didn't turn down
[46:43] these other things predestination brings
[46:47] you right back to where you should have
[46:49] been to start with
[46:50] he said never saw that he caught
[46:53] something right to see what it is to be
[46:58] who you and me we were supposed to be in
[47:01] here right to start with but how long
[47:07] did we spend I'm gonna place a lot of
[47:09] this now what is the new birth it's
[47:12] revelation to Jesus Christ if you
[47:16] believe that you can be saved off a
[47:18] mystical faith of substance if you don't
[47:21] believe it you can't be saved now that's
[47:27] how serious it is if you believe it you
[47:30] can be saved if you don't believe it you
[47:33] can't be saved so it's not what you
[47:36] believe
[47:36] right earnestly continuing to the faith
[47:39] he's accepting your faith
[47:45] he's accepted your faith your revelation
[47:50] your point of believing him sure the
[47:57] biggest portion of our faith is mental
[47:59] faiths but lastly be ensigns you
[48:01] remember we went through we said when
[48:02] that Holy Ghost coming down through he
[48:07] said it will bright make your mental
[48:11] faith a spiritual revelation there's a
[48:19] new birth is a spiritual revelation
[48:24] there's the baptism to see that's the
[48:26] hard part I've said baptism we look at
[48:29] baptism we think something's got to be
[48:31] coming down it's got to be something
[48:33] crawling all over us and happening I was
[48:36] looking at one today where bread around
[48:37] said we he said we've had the thunder
[48:40] we've had two lightnings we've had the
[48:42] thought but he said we didn't listen to
[48:44] the steel small voice vennett what the
[48:49] Prophet done the steel small voice we
[48:58] think the baptism has got to be a
[49:00] Baptist
[49:00] why don't we baptize in water the word
[49:03] baptize mean to submerge we say well I
[49:06] was just submerged with the Holy Ghost
[49:08] well why don't you go out and baptize in
[49:10] the water and call it out no it's not
[49:14] that well it's not that either what I've
[49:18] said upper room sure when sure all kind
[49:23] of things happening but where was the
[49:25] birth when that liquor file little each
[49:28] one of them in quickened within their
[49:31] their heart what they had heard darzee
[49:38] baptism when the Holy Ghost that's why
[49:42] your prophet could say you believe in
[49:44] what the baptism goes without a
[49:46] sensation now he never said you without
[49:48] an experience without a sensation
[49:53] but see Church on the statue of a
[49:58] perfect man he says the Holy Ghost
[50:00] coming down true Christ Holy Spirit
[50:04] welding these things together what'd he
[50:08] say blaspheme his name he says all of
[50:15] this gets finally welded together and
[50:21] see when it's all finished as we walk
[50:23] off this earth we can say we have the
[50:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost we can say we
[50:30] have the new birth we say we can say we
[50:32] have the morning and experience but each
[50:35] one will be a little bit speaking of it
[50:38] a little bit dividing I liken it in my
[50:41] thoughts to the five times of coming of
[50:43] Elijah when John gets over there and it
[50:47] emphatically seems to deny the very
[50:52] words of God when they said are you
[50:56] Elijah
[50:56] he said no
[51:04] am i right is that in the Bible John
[51:07] says no go see he was not all of Elijah
[51:12] there was for others to be tied up into
[51:14] that so he didn't have all of it
[51:19] so he said I'm not Elijah they said well
[51:23] who are you he said I'm a voice of one
[51:24] crying in the wilderness he made his
[51:26] statement right in the word and see
[51:30] that's the way it is with the baptism of
[51:31] the Holy Ghost the new Merck the
[51:33] born-again experience it's all of the
[51:35] same bringing us to a place to where
[51:39] that is Christ living in you we haven't
[51:43] started up the pyramid with the
[51:45] adoptions in time
[51:46] we're just laying this to the point of
[51:48] understanding of getting us to see
[51:53] what's taking place all right well that
[51:57] number 10 up if you want to brother cuz
[52:00] we didn't put that on the others are you
[52:03] getting to number 10 I'll be with number
[52:05] 8 number 9 where he's talking about
[52:07] blasphemous names biggest portion of our
[52:10] faith is mental faith and this coming
[52:14] from above oh brother
[52:17] what's coming what's drawing you is it
[52:21] true now that you can't be saved unless
[52:22] the father calls you know mariah is that
[52:26] Bible
[52:27] well worse the father well where's he at
[52:38] right he's drawing you he's drawing you
[52:46] and wind that Holy Spirit watching
[52:50] biggest part of my faith is mental faith
[52:52] that coming from above if it ever
[52:55] strikes this there's a godly spiritual
[52:59] faith right now watch what he says off
[53:05] the statue of a perfect man right in
[53:08] here right in here you see I got in
[53:10] between all these works in here and here
[53:13] are these little light waves come what
[53:16] is it
[53:17] listen at him listen to your prophet say
[53:22] something that to the world would be
[53:24] mass confusion listen to what he says
[53:29] the Holy Ghost coming down through
[53:34] Christ to see Holy Spirit the Holy
[53:45] Spirit is above all this I thought the
[53:48] Holy Spirit was the whole that's what
[53:51] I'm saying you could take anything you
[53:52] want to make him say the Holy Spirit is
[53:54] above all this welding this together
[53:56] building water perfect church for the
[53:58] capstone to cut off that sounds like two
[54:02] or three different persons you've got
[54:03] one holy ghosts up here you got one Holy
[54:05] Ghost in the middle and you've got one
[54:07] Holy Ghost down here but our three Holy
[54:09] Ghost know you only have one holding up
[54:12] that's three manifestations of the same
[54:16] Holy Ghost same Holy Ghost to justify
[54:20] the loser sanctified the Methodist
[54:22] baptized the Pentecostals it's now
[54:24] sitting in order the coming of the Lord
[54:27] is that what the Prophet had to say but
[54:31] see we've got to make it to understand I
[54:33] can take it you can you can make it say
[54:35] what you want to with brother down there
[54:38] he taught three of them cuz he taught
[54:41] Christ and he taught the Holy Ghost and
[54:44] he talked to Holy Spirit
[54:51] if you make him say anything you want
[54:54] him to say by twisting what you're
[55:00] talking about all right now let's get
[55:04] this Feist we went through the message
[55:08] there the other day talking about it the
[55:11] statue of a perfect man you've read it
[55:13] over and over brother Branham says Peter
[55:19] says I have obtained this like precious
[55:23] faith and I'm addressing it to those
[55:27] with like precious faith now told you
[55:33] there the other day making the
[55:34] statements about it to know Holy Ghost
[55:36] people then she didn't have the Holy
[55:37] Ghost and right they say you got turned
[55:39] upside down because you got to get you
[55:44] know you're trying to get it lined up
[55:46] mechanically and it won't work the truth
[55:51] is the truth it's been the Holy Ghost in
[55:55] every Church age it's been the new birth
[56:00] in every church age it's been Christ in
[56:04] every Church age but he said I've
[56:06] obtained paragraph 38 and 33 3 through
[56:11] 37 I have obtained this faith and I'm
[56:15] addressing this to those that have
[56:16] obtained this same faith I'm speaking
[56:20] this to those that are in Christ Jesus
[56:24] born again
[56:29] born-again Christians what's the
[56:33] foundation of all Christianity brother
[56:35] branham we're about 131 through 134 it's
[56:39] the foundation of faith 143 right in
[56:46] there he says he lays the foundation we
[56:49] went through these life wins t he lays
[56:52] the foundation what is the foundation of
[56:54] all Christianity faith it's laid upon
[56:59] your faith what did the prophets say
[57:04] about it he said you got to be born
[57:10] again you've got to be born again and
[57:15] said you're born again at faith now if
[57:18] you want me to read these I've read
[57:20] about a river life's Winston you're born
[57:25] again at faith but remember now I've
[57:32] went over it and over it for all the
[57:34] years you think well I don't mean thing
[57:36] to be you explain two phases two things
[57:38] at penny
[57:39] well you explain it you explained to me
[57:43] how brother Branham could say he met
[57:45] people with the baptism of the holy
[57:46] ghost 50 years before him that was
[57:49] exactly like the day of Pentecost
[57:58] then that's why I came up with that
[58:01] thought many many years ago that God
[58:03] helped me to understand it she then
[58:05] added up a room experience they had been
[58:08] tutored now not ever one of them don't
[58:10] just play with me with words I know how
[58:12] to talk and the 120 a Upper Room I 120
[58:16] wooden with Jesus for the three and a
[58:17] half years they was only with him for
[58:19] short periods of time in the life some
[58:21] of them coming in but at least they did
[58:23] here more than one but that when that
[58:25] Holy Ghost fell nobody they got the Holy
[58:30] Ghost outside with the 3000 was used to
[58:35] write the word show it to me
[58:40] no no war it was only the one in the
[58:45] upper room when that Holy Ghost failed
[58:47] remember the pot the disciples had been
[58:49] tutored for three and a half years no
[58:53] they didn't have the baptism of the Holy
[58:55] Ghost but they had God with them that
[58:59] taught him the word when the Holy Ghost
[59:02] failed look were placed him that's hurt
[59:08] the faith of the fathers called
[59:09] brotherly kindness and Holy Spirit faith
[59:14] of the father's that route we'll cover
[59:18] this on another message later that way
[59:20] was lost until the Prophet came to bring
[59:24] it back to us lost in the ages when the
[59:28] word was eat down the way to understand
[59:32] the statute of a perfect man was lost
[59:34] and you come up with the Pentecostals
[59:36] the best you could do and brother
[59:38] Brennan said born into the body of
[59:40] Christ
[59:41] I said not realizing there were just
[59:44] babies now realizing they were just
[59:46] beginning said they thought they had
[59:50] everything right we see that one hundred
[59:55] and twenty three and a half years a lot
[59:58] of them was tutored and trained by the
[1:00:01] Lord Jesus himself when the Holy Ghost
[1:00:03] fail look workplace
[1:00:06] but the 3000 outside heard one Sherman
[1:00:10] the house of canoe use heard one Sherman
[1:00:13] I'm not kind of years which one um yeah
[1:00:17] I guess it is can use it not heard one
[1:00:20] Sherman and the Holy Ghost fail and the
[1:00:23] Bible says can we forbid water to seeing
[1:00:26] the baptize day and they've received the
[1:00:28] Holy Ghost that we did at the beginning
[1:00:35] what you see the difference I mean look
[1:00:38] at it and just think about 120 they had
[1:00:42] the message planted when the Holy Ghost
[1:00:43] fell it quicken these to them but around
[1:00:47] said stature forgive and they had these
[1:00:48] ruptures what he said the headstone
[1:00:51] hadn't come yet all right now but ones
[1:00:56] that were born again of the 3,000 just
[1:00:59] finally got into the body across that's
[1:01:02] the best way of saying it because they
[1:01:04] couldn't have been nothing out they
[1:01:05] didn't know anything else they didn't
[1:01:07] even know about Jesus they heard the
[1:01:09] message and we're quickened and said men
[1:01:11] and brethren what must we do to be safe
[1:01:13] repent every one of me baptized in the
[1:01:14] name of Jesus Christ and 3,000 receive
[1:01:21] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:24] you read statue of a perfect man over
[1:01:26] and over and over we read around said
[1:01:28] see there he says you're born again at
[1:01:31] faith you're in the body of Christ
[1:01:38] you're converted
[1:01:46] read the message you've got the new
[1:01:50] birth
[1:01:57] and he talks about people of like
[1:02:02] precious faith
[1:02:05] Peter said I've got this faith what was
[1:02:10] he doing Peter had the same Holy Ghost
[1:02:14] right he's writing to those that are in
[1:02:18] Christ Jesus who have the Holy Ghost
[1:02:20] right cause it's not written to the
[1:02:23] world surely it's not written to the
[1:02:26] world to try to explain adoptions and
[1:02:28] and all of these things and headstones
[1:02:30] and things like that to the world come
[1:02:32] on at least give the opportunity to get
[1:02:35] the baby here and let it grow a little
[1:02:37] bit all right it's based upon your faith
[1:02:45] and remember what I've said over and
[1:02:48] over it says add to your faith now it
[1:02:55] doesn't come on then and say add to your
[1:02:58] virtue add to your knowledge you better
[1:03:00] do it add to your faith
[1:03:03] you don't mean a thing to most of you
[1:03:06] but brother Branham note exactly what he
[1:03:08] said he said there are seven adds to the
[1:03:12] pyramid count them behind me these eight
[1:03:18] things come on nine technically one two
[1:03:24] three four six seven eight nine
[1:03:28] technically but the Holy Spirit is there
[1:03:32] to weld it in and seal it he says
[1:03:36] there's seven I adds because see you
[1:03:38] don't add faith faith is a birth it's
[1:03:46] your faith quickened unto you and it
[1:03:52] brings it to his faith
[1:03:56] that's why I've told you this well it
[1:03:59] was seven rayher time brother Brown says
[1:04:02] how faith in God you see there's a lot
[1:04:05] of difference in having faith in God and
[1:04:07] having the faith of God
[1:04:09] the faith of God has eternal life
[1:04:12] having faith in God is just your
[1:04:14] faithfulness to believe it how faith in
[1:04:21] God right we're supposed to but have the
[1:04:24] faith of God and see where do we get to
[1:04:29] it and you'll see how it ties together
[1:04:30] that Peter is taking it to add add to
[1:04:35] your faith that's like precious faith
[1:04:39] and he said add virtue and knowledge add
[1:04:42] tempers to work to your experience
[1:04:47] because when you are born again you have
[1:04:50] that new birth in your soul which is the
[1:04:55] life of Almighty God right which is the
[1:05:00] new birth which is the born-again
[1:05:02] experience which is the baptism of the
[1:05:06] holy spirit to give you eternal life in
[1:05:12] your soul but now we're going to read
[1:05:19] something just a minute so hold on
[1:05:21] listen to the point you must be born
[1:05:26] again and the born-again experiences
[1:05:31] faith when your faith your faith to
[1:05:37] believe God is accepted of God it
[1:05:44] becomes eternal life read blasphemous
[1:05:47] names and statue of a perfect man
[1:05:49] together it becomes eternal life in your
[1:05:53] soul then you can add virtue to that but
[1:05:58] it only makes you a baby when we receive
[1:06:03] the Holy Ghost there's none of us
[1:06:05] receive the Holy Ghost as the Apostles
[1:06:07] did it was never after then
[1:06:12] even the great Apostle Paul to come to
[1:06:17] where the disciples were he had to
[1:06:19] receive the new birth and go to himself
[1:06:23] birth three a ninth years same amount
[1:06:27] town to the stop of God right and when
[1:06:32] he comes out of there and watch him Paul
[1:06:36] doesn't preach the stature of a perfect
[1:06:39] man that was Peters message Paul
[1:06:45] preaches adoption now don't you believe
[1:06:53] they were both saying the same thing
[1:06:57] Paul's preaching adoption Peters
[1:07:00] preaching statue of a perfect man now
[1:07:04] how do you get adopted stature of a
[1:07:07] perfect man tells you how to get adopted
[1:07:14] right so Paul comes out preaching the
[1:07:18] same thing Peter was preaching but
[1:07:21] preaching it on the basis of what God
[1:07:23] give him to show the growth development
[1:07:26] in their and the lives of mankind after
[1:07:29] you're born again then you're being born
[1:07:32] again as you're coming up through faith
[1:07:34] virtue knowledge temperance because all
[1:07:37] that is holy ghost' added to you it's
[1:07:40] added to your faith your faith in has
[1:07:45] become a spiritual revelation which is
[1:07:47] eternal life so then it's not your faith
[1:07:49] anymore but it's your faith go God has
[1:07:52] given it to you it's his faith it's his
[1:07:58] faith making your faith alive giving you
[1:08:09] the new birth the Paul and Peter Bowe is
[1:08:13] explaining the new birth
[1:08:17] now watch pipe Peter Peter says having
[1:08:20] escaped the corruption that is in the
[1:08:22] world through lust and all this coming
[1:08:24] to like precious faith I'm addressing
[1:08:26] this that and he says that you've
[1:08:28] escaped that of corruption and all
[1:08:30] through the world and he says add to
[1:08:33] your faith virtue knowledge temperance
[1:08:39] what does Paul say Paul says Romans I'm
[1:08:47] in Galatians 4 Paul said a son is no
[1:08:52] different than an heir though he be Lord
[1:08:59] of all but is under tutors and governors
[1:09:05] Peter is saying the Holy Ghost is your
[1:09:08] tutor or governor Paul is saying the
[1:09:11] holy the tutor the governor is the
[1:09:14] growth development of the statue of a
[1:09:16] perfect man do you understand
[1:09:19] Paul and Peter we're not teaching
[1:09:21] different they were both teaching the
[1:09:23] one thing the growth development of
[1:09:27] Christianity into the hearts of mankind
[1:09:30] to bring us to an adoption 'el stage and
[1:09:36] the last of it all is Paul in Romans 8
[1:09:38] the adoption to wit to understand the
[1:09:42] redemption of these bodies why because
[1:09:45] Paul could not take you to the
[1:09:47] redemption of the body he could only
[1:09:50] speak of it he couldn't take it to the
[1:09:53] moment in the twinkling of an eye he
[1:09:55] could speak of it he couldn't take it to
[1:09:57] the point of corruptible putting on
[1:09:59] incorruption
[1:09:59] he could only speak of it because it
[1:10:04] could not be made manifest back there it
[1:10:09] was to come down to this day
[1:10:15] I'm not gonna ask for a raise of hands
[1:10:17] somebody's gonna continue the message
[1:10:22] because I'd wonder how many of you have
[1:10:24] called it now to where we can read
[1:10:32] something brother Branham says and
[1:10:35] listen to it now remember what I'm
[1:10:41] saying what I'm reading here is right he
[1:10:47] just don't sound I don't know how to say
[1:10:53] it
[1:10:56] he ends up the last quote that I gave
[1:10:59] you first thing you got to do is be
[1:11:02] going born again this is from statue of
[1:11:05] perfect man paragraph 94 to 96 you've
[1:11:09] got to be changed and when you're
[1:11:12] changed you become a new creation
[1:11:15] now you're getting right now now you
[1:11:18] don't have to worry about the feathers
[1:11:20] it can take care of itself when you're
[1:11:23] born again now notice you must be born
[1:11:29] again that is changed there's got to be
[1:11:32] a change jesus said except a man be born
[1:11:36] again
[1:11:39] you cannot understand the kingdom
[1:11:43] alright I'm not asking you for a raise
[1:11:46] of hand I'm asking you for a simple
[1:11:48] understanding within your sale do you
[1:11:51] see the statue of a perfect man and what
[1:11:53] it is that your faith is when God gives
[1:11:56] you the new birth and that's at the
[1:12:01] bottom of the pyramid and ever
[1:12:03] born-again believer the Apostles came to
[1:12:06] this part Holy Spirit called the faith
[1:12:09] of the father's that's why we got to be
[1:12:11] turned back to where they were but we
[1:12:13] start our down here as newborn babes
[1:12:15] desire the sincere milk of the word that
[1:12:18] we may grow thereby we started off with
[1:12:22] babies as with an earnest of our
[1:12:24] inheritance until the redemption of the
[1:12:26] purchased possession I'm quoting
[1:12:28] scriptures now let's see if we can hold
[1:12:33] on a minute
[1:12:42] let's read some things go ahead brothers
[1:12:45] were gonna jump all the way over to 19
[1:12:47] okay never who's on the pole back turn
[1:12:50] you jumped to 19 the message called key
[1:12:56] to the door so communion is for
[1:13:00] Christians that's born again of the
[1:13:02] Spirit of God and born again does not
[1:13:06] necessarily mean now that you got the
[1:13:08] Holy Ghost
[1:13:17] now remember our now many teach that and
[1:13:23] watch him I don't know anybody that
[1:13:25] teaches it like this watch him now as
[1:13:29] old brother organ right said that not
[1:13:33] from the pulpit here is he but new birth
[1:13:36] is not the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:13:39] the scripture doesn't support it I don't
[1:13:44] think see to my way of seeing it I
[1:13:48] believe that you're born again no
[1:13:52] brother Brad what do you say it well
[1:13:59] brother out of sure hid that one because
[1:14:01] you you said all the whole time that the
[1:14:04] born-again experience the baptism of the
[1:14:06] Holy Ghost and the new birth is one in
[1:14:08] the same
[1:14:11] that's exactly what he just said he just
[1:14:19] said that
[1:14:26] short don't sound like it well
[1:14:29] let's go some further then beings you
[1:14:32] think that much of it let's go some more
[1:14:37] number 20 that was the key to the door
[1:14:45] priest is 62 this is why I'm against
[1:14:48] organized religion piece of 62 and this
[1:14:53] is after the the statue of perfect man
[1:15:01] was preached now listen let's that thing
[1:15:04] that other one was to be able to keep
[1:15:06] through the doors after it - is that
[1:15:07] right I believe that's right we'll get
[1:15:10] it in a minute he's bringing it down and
[1:15:12] trying to explain something and look
[1:15:13] what he says I never thought there was a
[1:15:16] person believed that like me till this
[1:15:20] morning I heard charged fuller as I was
[1:15:24] going down he believes too that the new
[1:15:28] birth is not the baptism of the holy God
[1:15:31] the new birth is being born again the
[1:15:34] Holy Ghost is the baptism
[1:15:43] brother branham's just say it that's
[1:15:47] what I'm saying you won't read it
[1:15:48] you read it little brown just said the
[1:15:50] baptism when the Holy Ghost a new birth
[1:15:52] and the born-again experience is all the
[1:15:54] same he just said that but can you read
[1:15:59] that
[1:16:02] go ahead questions and answers on
[1:16:06] Hebrews 1957 and by one spirit we're all
[1:16:13] baptized into one body that's correct
[1:16:16] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:16:18] different is a different act from the
[1:16:21] new birth one is a birth one is a
[1:16:29] baptism one brings you eternal life the
[1:16:34] other one gives you power it gives power
[1:16:36] into eternal I see to operate now you
[1:16:39] got it he just said the new birth the
[1:16:43] born-again experience the baptism when
[1:16:44] hole goes and one more sign can you read
[1:16:47] it go ahead you must be born again 1961
[1:16:58] this would have been before the stature
[1:16:59] of perfectly come here 62 I think 318
[1:17:02] ugly that's right now I want to say this
[1:17:05] to the pastor's that will perhaps
[1:17:07] receive this tape I suppose maybe just a
[1:17:12] little different from what the regular
[1:17:14] Church teaches it I teach and believe
[1:17:19] and believe can sufficiently prove by
[1:17:24] the scriptures that you're born of the
[1:17:27] Spirit and then baptized into the body
[1:17:31] by the Holy Spirit again he's saying the
[1:17:41] new birth the born-again experience the
[1:17:43] baptism with the Holy Ghost is the same
[1:17:45] can you read it man you got us okay
[1:17:51] go ahead to the next one this is still
[1:17:54] over you must be born again 23 I
[1:17:59] remember what he said I teach them to
[1:18:01] believe that you're born to the spirit
[1:18:03] then baptized into the body not the Holy
[1:18:06] Spirit that's exactly the statue of a
[1:18:07] perfect man that's exactly what he's
[1:18:09] taught in the message the statue of a
[1:18:11] perfect man go ahead to the 23 you must
[1:18:16] be born again
[1:18:17] he's talking about you couldn't pull it
[1:18:19] back no matter what happened that Souls
[1:18:21] got to be changed here born again you
[1:18:23] say what about the Holy Ghost brother
[1:18:25] branham the Holy Ghost baptizes you into
[1:18:29] the body for service but you believe
[1:18:31] unto eternal life he they hear of my
[1:18:34] words and believeth on him that sent me
[1:18:37] has eternal life then you're baptized by
[1:18:40] the Holy Spirit into the body for
[1:18:44] manifestations of the gifts and so forth
[1:18:49] but you believe to eternal life he that
[1:18:53] believeth has eternal life and you
[1:18:55] believe when you're dead and are born
[1:18:57] regenerated a new creature that's when
[1:19:00] you really believe I still saying the
[1:19:03] same thing statue a perfect man this is
[1:19:06] you're born again at faith that's what
[1:19:09] he's explaining you're the next one the
[1:19:14] back to the key to the door I think yeah
[1:19:19] you believe in to eternal life and are
[1:19:21] born again by your faith jesus said in
[1:19:24] st. John 5:24 he that heareth my word
[1:19:27] and believeth on him that sent me has
[1:19:29] everlasting life not the Holy Ghost just
[1:19:33] has everlasting life
[1:19:36] he's born into the family of God and
[1:19:39] then baptized into the Holy Ghost with
[1:19:43] power of the intelligence of faith to
[1:19:47] believe the gospel and put it to work
[1:19:48] and make it act then he acts like the
[1:19:52] Son of God then he can cast out Devils
[1:20:01] to the next one questions and answers no
[1:20:06] when you believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:20:07] Christ you then have the new birth when
[1:20:10] you believe on the Lord you receive a
[1:20:12] new thought a new life but it isn't the
[1:20:15] baptism of the Holy Ghost see you got
[1:20:18] the new birth when you believe you got
[1:20:21] eternal life it's a gift of God this
[1:20:22] gift to you through Sovereign Grace by
[1:20:25] accepting the gift that God is giving to
[1:20:27] use it he that here at my words and
[1:20:30] believed on him that sent me hath
[1:20:31] eternal life has everlasting life that's
[1:20:35] the new birth you're converted it means
[1:20:38] you're turned around but the baptism of
[1:20:41] the Holy Spirit puts you into the body
[1:20:43] of Christ subject to the gifts for
[1:20:47] service what it doesn't make you any
[1:20:52] more of a Christian I know that's
[1:20:59] floating hard through the mind so I'll
[1:21:00] back up and say it the new birth that
[1:21:04] you receive right here at faith the
[1:21:08] headstone don't make you no greater
[1:21:10] Christian I don't mind saying it just
[1:21:17] puts you into the body of guilt now why
[1:21:22] one spirit were baptized firstly into
[1:21:24] one body
[1:21:25] that's it Paul gar different gifts and
[1:21:28] then this body is nine spiritual gifts
[1:21:29] in this but look you have to be baptized
[1:21:33] into a body and remember you Bab gets
[1:21:38] into the body with the baptism in the
[1:21:40] Holy Spirit right is that what he said
[1:21:41] over here now watch him you have to be
[1:21:44] baptized into the body to possess one of
[1:21:47] these gifts that was born again scarlet
[1:21:51] about repentance
[1:21:52] well guess is he talking about
[1:21:57] how about this quote the gifts without
[1:22:05] the virtues is a stumbling block to the
[1:22:12] unbeliever brother branham must have
[1:22:18] knowed what he's talking about because
[1:22:21] he says you got to be baptized into the
[1:22:22] body you really have one day yes outside
[1:22:26] of that it can be anointings it can be
[1:22:29] anything under the National countdown
[1:22:36] priest after statue of perfect man and
[1:22:41] the new birth is people taught that the
[1:22:45] baptism with Holy Ghost is the new birth
[1:22:46] now that's wrong the baptism of the Holy
[1:22:53] Ghost is different from the new birth
[1:22:59] he's still explaining the new birth the
[1:23:03] baptism when the Holy Ghost the
[1:23:05] born-again experience it's all the one
[1:23:06] thing you just st. reading look the
[1:23:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost is different
[1:23:12] from the new bar the new birth is when
[1:23:14] you're born again oh the new birth is
[1:23:21] when you're born again and he just
[1:23:26] explained you're born again at faith
[1:23:34] the new birth is when you're born again
[1:23:36] but the Holy Ghost is when power comes
[1:23:39] into that birth for service any times do
[1:23:45] you need this scripture you shall
[1:23:48] receive power after the Holy Ghost is
[1:23:54] come upon you not before what but the
[1:24:03] Holy Ghost is when power comes into that
[1:24:05] birth for service that's the exactly see
[1:24:07] the Holy Ghost is baptized into the Holy
[1:24:10] Ghost the new birth you have the new
[1:24:12] birth by being believing on the Lord
[1:24:14] Jesus Christ see by having faith and
[1:24:17] accepting him as your Savior are we on
[1:24:21] the statue of perfect
[1:24:23] that's birth see because you PI's from
[1:24:25] death under life if you want to back
[1:24:29] that up take st. John 5:24 he that
[1:24:31] believeth in him that sent me has
[1:24:33] everlasting life he's got life because
[1:24:36] he believed and that same group had to
[1:24:38] go to Pentecost to be baptized with the
[1:24:40] Holy Ghost now it doesn't mean that they
[1:24:42] had to do it they had to go there to get
[1:24:44] to holy hood the Holy Ghost is power for
[1:24:46] service
[1:24:48] so when talk about you got to be born
[1:24:54] again and applying that to the Holy
[1:24:56] Ghost he's saying other people does it
[1:25:00] after the Holy Ghost is come upon you
[1:25:03] you already believed into eternal life
[1:25:05] so forth but they had to have the Holy
[1:25:08] Ghost for power what about it
[1:25:25] what about it
[1:25:30] either brother branham is teaching the
[1:25:32] same thing or we're massively confused
[1:25:42] either he's teaching the statue of a
[1:25:44] perfect man that you're born again at
[1:25:47] faith and then when you receive the
[1:25:53] faith of the father you receive the
[1:25:57] baptism when the Holy Ghost the father's
[1:25:59] did which is the word revealed and then
[1:26:09] we can be waiting on the headstone is
[1:26:15] why sure don't sound what I'm saying is
[1:26:19] reading I read them you can make him say
[1:26:22] anything you want him to say but
[1:26:27] everything I read just staying the same
[1:26:29] time well brother I sure didn't get it
[1:26:40] maybe you need to pray a little bit and
[1:26:44] say Lord was that prophet so massively
[1:26:46] confused that he taught us that the new
[1:26:50] birth the born-again experience the
[1:26:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost is one on the
[1:26:52] side then he turns around and says I can
[1:26:54] emphatic ly prove that you're born again
[1:26:56] and then baptized into the body
[1:27:05] see that's why we've got it all figured
[1:27:07] I'll look at the statue of a perfect man
[1:27:12] you're born again at faith each one of
[1:27:16] these is a virtue that you are baptized
[1:27:19] in to that sealed into you by the Holy
[1:27:25] Spirit from above welding it together
[1:27:27] bringing it down
[1:27:32] we remember the statute of a perfect man
[1:27:36] is not the statue of you it's the statue
[1:27:41] of the perfect man which is Christ Jesus
[1:27:42] in you so you're born again at faith and
[1:27:53] you're baptized into all of these things
[1:27:56] and what will be the headstone as we end
[1:27:59] it come on musician what'll be the
[1:28:01] headstone the prophet said one day
[1:28:03] they'll come such a baptism of the Holy
[1:28:06] Ghost from heaven that will feel every
[1:28:09] fiber of our being and take us in the
[1:28:13] rapture what are you looking for our
[1:28:17] brother Dale I'm looking for the faith
[1:28:19] of the fathers and that brings a baptism
[1:28:26] that brings it to word that we've gotten
[1:28:29] a word revealed and we're back to the
[1:28:31] faith of the fathers and even then it's
[1:28:37] just a place to be waiting for the
[1:28:41] headstone now I don't mind go ahead and
[1:28:47] tell me the way I believe it because you
[1:28:49] see folks I'll never believe at one time
[1:28:51] the headstone to the church you can
[1:28:55] believe it's this you can believe it's
[1:28:56] that you can put it here say if this but
[1:28:59] you don't tie it all together in one
[1:29:00] place
[1:29:05] I believe the headstone to the church is
[1:29:07] the opening of those seven seals because
[1:29:15] we remember now you say yeah but I
[1:29:18] believe in that this has got to happen
[1:29:20] and this has got to happen we got to get
[1:29:21] this message there ain't gonna argue
[1:29:23] with you
[1:29:24] I'm gonna just ask you where you got it
[1:29:27] because according to my understanding
[1:29:31] when I asked a man is sitting in my
[1:29:33] house one day and he was lambasted in
[1:29:37] the message and I said you believe that
[1:29:39] y'all going out beyond brother on him I
[1:29:43] said brother I won't ask you one
[1:29:45] question
[1:29:46] what can you preach to me pipes brother
[1:29:49] Brown I said because he's already
[1:29:54] preached to the future home right the
[1:30:01] prophets already preached this to the
[1:30:02] future home what can be passed to future
[1:30:06] home sure there's a message of here to
[1:30:11] be brought down to the endless of Ages
[1:30:13] all through that so we're not going to
[1:30:15] end it all but the point is those seals
[1:30:22] now my quoting brother Randall marriage
[1:30:26] and divorce was revealed in the seals
[1:30:31] what else was revealed in the seals and
[1:30:35] he said serpents he was revealed in the
[1:30:38] ceilings in serpent seed was preached in
[1:30:40] 1958 I'm just full hearted enough to
[1:30:47] believe what he says those seven seals
[1:30:50] contain the complete full plan of
[1:30:54] redemption so now if anything else
[1:30:57] you're expecting to happen it can't be
[1:31:00] redemption I'm sorry I'm blunt
[1:31:05] statements in fact if you're looking for
[1:31:08] something else in redemptive plan where
[1:31:10] are you going to get it from because the
[1:31:12] seals is the full plan of redemption
[1:31:16] I didn't say that your prophet said it
[1:31:20] I'm not against anybody in their beliefs
[1:31:23] and their thoughts what this is going to
[1:31:25] be no I've never been against anybody in
[1:31:32] that college I've always been the same
[1:31:39] line the same thoughts I don't mind even
[1:31:45] being blunt so you say well I'm
[1:31:46] expecting brother Branham to come back
[1:31:48] amen because he'll be the first one to
[1:31:51] resurrection
[1:31:52] I believe that always believe that well
[1:31:59] we're gonna have this we're gonna have
[1:32:00] that I've always believed we've got a 30
[1:32:03] 40 day time after the resurrection of
[1:32:06] the saints I guess you think for 30-40
[1:32:10] days we're gonna call off two or three
[1:32:12] services because well we're just too
[1:32:14] tired or not Wingo house services I mean
[1:32:17] after the dead raised any come on you
[1:32:21] know I mean the dead raised and you're
[1:32:22] happy and rejoicing well I don't know
[1:32:24] where we'll go to church or not I'm too
[1:32:27] tired I just don't feel good now we
[1:32:33] ain't gonna be that way it's going to be
[1:32:39] 30 or 40 days or the greatest rejoicing
[1:32:42] that has ever been my brother branham
[1:32:48] said you'll look no then those people
[1:32:53] made it and what a happy time that'll be
[1:33:00] that's why I believe the same thing I've
[1:33:02] always believed I had to change it I
[1:33:07] just believe in a progressive
[1:33:10] understanding there won't make it a
[1:33:15] statement again so now everybody working
[1:33:16] huh I believe read a random talk the
[1:33:21] stature of a perfect man before he came
[1:33:23] to 62 he said himself he had just got
[1:33:28] up in the woods that scripture of faith
[1:33:33] virtue or knowledge temperance patient
[1:33:35] he said I just got this up in the woods
[1:33:38] on what I was going to preach on you
[1:33:43] want to stay to a midnight you want to
[1:33:46] go in to the old message called
[1:33:48] Intervale or why my people so talked
[1:33:52] about her what the title that changed
[1:33:54] its a much better Branham said in that
[1:33:57] message looking for a walk in
[1:34:03] instrumentalities maybe the words as a
[1:34:07] people that Jesus Christ would be living
[1:34:11] in before the change the statue of
[1:34:17] perfect man he says these virtues will
[1:34:21] have to be in the seven church ages as
[1:34:24] the church that will go in the rapture
[1:34:27] he said in these virtues have to be in
[1:34:31] the individual that will go in the
[1:34:35] rapture I didn't say that he did well
[1:34:41] brother Dale I just don't understand
[1:34:42] you've confused me because you read some
[1:34:44] statements that are totally contrary to
[1:34:47] what you stated over and over to us that
[1:34:49] the new birth the baptism with old ago
[1:34:51] in the morning an experience of self
[1:34:53] thing but the Prophet said it's wrong
[1:34:56] let's go out going to the Prophet so
[1:35:01] long I told you when I get through we'll
[1:35:06] see whose anchored in tomorrow I'll go
[1:35:12] see who was anchored
[1:35:16] you sure honey try to do no correction I
[1:35:19] read to you what he said
[1:35:24] yeah but he said that listen I believe
[1:35:29] the baptism believe you're born into the
[1:35:30] body across and then baptized in the
[1:35:32] body don't you realize what he's
[1:35:34] teaching adoption adoption that when a
[1:35:41] child has grown up and become to the
[1:35:43] maturity of the manifestation of the
[1:35:46] sons of God Romans 8 adoption is what he
[1:35:54] was teaching in his early men history go
[1:35:56] back and run it in your computer the
[1:35:58] first one I found was 1950 that he's
[1:36:02] preaching adoption I believe he grew up
[1:36:10] in grace and knowledge but I don't
[1:36:13] believe he was wrong when he says I can
[1:36:16] prove that you're born into the body and
[1:36:19] in baptized with the Holy Ghost I
[1:36:22] believe that's exactly right
[1:36:24] that's 1000% true because I believe in
[1:36:33] adoption that's down oh yeah number 6 in
