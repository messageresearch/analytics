========================================

Gabby you alright here we go now everybody here with us today being outdoors with Revelation chapter state now what we're doing if we're talking on the for sale and we were talking about last Sunday the rapture come on the fourth seal all right but that five six and seven can't do away with so what do please leave a comment doing hanging five six and seven and put them back under the fourth okay not to lift you can't you got to remember you got our understanding this in a supernatural way or in a way that five six and seven natural will will not have them all four five and six will never happen one over here cuz it is the Israel getting saved literally it's the it's and you can say that you gettin killed in two prophets Consing we will not be here during that time okay but the chronolock saw programs that you can compare the seal with the church ages but you can't compare me but you can't exactly put seal one with Church agent one still vision okay but you can because remember with the first seal covers three churches right okay the second seal covers what one church age all right okay third seal we just got me from the third seal the man covers to charge ages basically going on that all right then you got what the one we're talking about the rapture happens on the fourth seal seven church age so don't worry about your numbers okay don't worry about your numbers going one two three four because I'm sure that a lot of people do not understand is when building ramps there's a rapture takes place on the fourth seal yeah yet the seven seals Lord see everybody just go well now he painted we got in God anything is possible everything is possible there is a natural meaning listen we have to bribe know there's and there's a natural happening to the world there's a spiritual happening to the world there's a natural happening to the bride there's a spiritual happening to a bride there's a natural happening to Israel there's a spiritual have a vehicle so man you you know and you get old clutch you get a cluster up and you think well now I can't understand this number one we know about the natural that ought to be easy we're living in the seventh circuit okay supernaturally we're not in the cemetery okay we're already called a mini eight-day we're already a sucker it's the saying the other day you know you you get your preaching that so much oh well somebody's going to catch it going brother bro away just like brother Paul he said to the rap she's going to do a place in the resurrection it doesn't happen and all it's done to play no but tell me one thing what it is a rapture the rapture happening on the fourth seal has got to be a supernatural happening simply because the one thing is it's prop what is promised to happen but timewise it's promised to happen in the 7:30 you got that girl cuz the raptures not is not a natural happening so supernatural happen okay did something that's not natural alright alright so the wrath which is going to take place on the fourth seal because the combat these are gone in other words the Holy Ghost has lifted off the earth prophet signal time he said the Holy Ghost will live off the earth and then what return to the Jews right and how how amazing because it will try might last night and brother julep region on Wednesday night the reason that other things are not happening this earth that that that more of the happenings in the Bible is not happening on the earth over here right so we're here the Holy Ghost is still on the earth in the for combat beef what getting and getting a bride ready this is not for the world right they don't care ok because when when when the rapture takes place is going to take the Holy Ghost off the earth and the only thing that's going to come back to is one hundred and forty six thousand people not three 144 into darkness 144 into no the Holy Ghost is going to kill 900 of the two prophets wrong they're going to breach and listen at that moment they're the only few people with the Holy Ghost on the whole phase they are afraid how awesome they look but they have but look at their control God has his funneled everything down to two men now the 144,000 going to receive the Holy Ghost sure but when they leave that's why the Battle of Armageddon is going to happen there is no flesh saved savable at that time right you heard what I said I said no flesh saleable I didn't say that the Phyllis virgin won't get eternal life later or some am given water my name will give eternal life later but they're going to come up in that white throne judgment in a dead flesh or flesh that's that's dying okay then I got that point so what happening that this for seal is that all this is going to be lifted up off the earth and there's nobody what a horrible thing there's nobody going to have the hold up that's why the place can fall programs different time you know you just get you just get a minor piece of it now let's go out and holding up a trap because why the older background because you're walking around here because there's Brian in Afghanistan alright I understand all these places for this you know with the troubles are really big even in true there's a bride that touching nothing on it do my prophets no harm but what about when they're all gone then the wrath of God brother Esther is going to be poured out what on the Gentiles then come to the Jews while 144,000 is getting their Redemption are their message of redemption see their message your redemption is like it's like you know the day of atonement the day of atonement is not killing the dammit oma if you don't kill up an animal it's morning for the kill that's already been so what happened is they're going to come enough crucified Christ again they're going to realize he was already killed they're gonna realize that they did it right they going to realize that they the Jews Jewish Israel because Jesus cause of death but remember what the Bible says where you get those charts in the house of my friends don't worry it was done to preserve life in other words to the 144,000 the two prophets are going to easily turn and say those people that come to a rapturing condition rattling revelation the jinjo God has taken them out of the way now is your time right now you're not and they're gonna be so focused on that three and a half years of look what it's cooked on how long it took us so many even 50 or 60 years just to go up statute perfect man and look at them they don't have to all go up to a perfect man they don't have to be manifested sons died but but wow these P products are I believe because they're they're controlling nature there they're going to absolutely do what I could have done and then I've been a fault but they're going to bring down plagues because why because of the rejection man has rejected this whole thing I I was looking up this morning and no disrespect to anyone but the paper had a they always have a little snippet from a preacher in the area you know come in and in say little comment or something you know and this woman it was the woman to Methodist Church and I thought man Methodist Church John Wesley would absolutely pay them people apart no one knew the woman treatment she's got down at the very end she said we pray to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Ghost to bring these blessings upon you but you see it but see that's why I was saying the other day you gotta look at this thing in in two two spots and once you really get this though it's going to help listen it's going to help you from now till we go in after that there was two parts of brother grounds message [Applause] the first one was what restore us back to right here this is the pyramid right okay this is so this is his first part restore the hearts of the children back children back to the fathers children babbling Pentecostal baby back to the faith of the father that was once delivered to the Saints in this birth birthday front right the second part of his message was what absolutely the headstone himself okay remember it was rejected it became the chief Cornerstone and grew back up how did it only grows up we're coming out last night it only grows through profits but a 500 ministry catches what that Prophet says and brings it to the people then in the days of the boys sure the property God brought this but you can't do away with it that some Steve my brother upset about taking a leap of the one that's an delete from the Trinity put it together and it grew a big tree a nice big tree you can't do like some dead will from 47 to 63 was was Paul he had yet fallacies and he and he me and he and he and he just keep going on you heard it so we did away in 47 63 and then we take 63 to 65 they have portrait that part truth brother Brown did have some fallacies in here he talked about Moore's Rider was the holy note he talked at love with the evidence of the holy note there sure but what happened was what was God doing God was honing a man one man he was only one man well what he had to go back dad you've heard of man's hippo he was holding he was only the Prophet to wear what this would sit on top of this yes joy 1963 when the Lord made him out there in Arizona brought him a revelation of what we're talking about of the seals that his new manager he always said he was looking for any man for something new something whatever he just didn't really know but from 63 to 65 but you can't say well we're just gonna you know we're going to major on this and minor on that it's all these people get these pretty strong counter sermon you know about me you can't understand him from 63 to 65 till just a with a simple 47 to 53 well let me tell you talk about 47 to 63 that's not so example back to faith of the Father I want them to come back and do what happened in the book last do what happened in the book of Acts and we'll say that we took 47 63 and we have become that and now let's move on but they're still down here what with the children they're down here with the babies drink the milk all right so you got to have the whole picture the whole picture so from 63 to 65 it was the same grand I had your message that Jesus Christ preached while he was on the earth no no right amen could he take 63 65 63 64 65 because he died of delayed 65 so that's three years but if you go back six months when you started preaching on a person one thing another but spoke more in C bring all that in and need priests because remember there's a lap over brother Brown's Menifee there's a lap over and everything God the only thing about God is is one day he's going to work on a have a a rapture anymore not going to have an overlap or three or days later no we're going out after and we all want to go another round tip we'll be getting together then we all want to leave but now in Gaza everything he does is he gives grape he gives a lap over there was a lap over brother gravel ministry going from 60 about 61 62 you see he preaches - anyway preachers own book more driven c4 this with preachers anyway I think about say my good morning let's create so today but that was a it was a walk it was something building up to not you're dumping the seals because honestly they didn't get it he told me get it after the seals were broke they did anyway and God was still but what you're doing though he's bringing it to me and you where it's Frank is bringing us up bring us up bringing us up bringing us up to schedule perfect man to where we can get this headstone message now truly and honestly that has stone message now that is only for a small group of people that's going to really understand that okay and that's all right that's no big deal it's really not dottie turned around last night and said we come about being in the temple you know then and he said why just wanna be a share that's a lie like David I said just put me at the door let me I'm too big let me be a doormat in the house of God just let me be somewhere inside the you know inside of the door but but we can't have that all because there's got to be someone like we're coming let's not there's got to be someone that brings describe your profession so it's got to be through a fivefold ministry trying their best to get you to see who you are not belittle you're not saying you don't know nothing I don't like that because you know you you do if you're born again you're a child of God period if you're born again and as we've said for Nate mom roll out last night now what about people with the Holy Ghost different listen you can refuse further minh of the word and be born again that's a paradox to me but some people can only go so far and that's it and God said I am well pleased to go in that person but I've got these other people that want to go on now he's not going to keep that child out remember the bar well done when he went out he was a child when he come back he was a child with some more authority he was put back in position okay same way with you and I same way with a prize Jesus Christ is going to be some that's going listen we're all belong just barely maybe there's not going to be so nice standing at the end time because brother Graham said your pleasures gonna be sticky right up to the day you're changing today right all right so the day we're changed when we're changed we can finally say it's over okay is there done it's finished but until then listen we'll talk about a little bit after noon about what the flesh did we'll program talk about the flesh because the metal Genesis 1:26 man never fell but when he put that 1:26 man into the 2:7 man the two-seven man fell by his nature by the natural things that he did and by his body reacting to the things we'll talk about that let's go but so the word never fails yes see the word eternal man they're just adding stuff to it okay I always ought to make it we all you know we all got to be in this yeah well I understand about that blast question I mean I I really I was thinking brother Nasir went to Pakistan even though we don't agree with a lot of things he said but he still did message for you he's got some good knowledge at least but he went to Pakistan and he said I don't preach just giving the ministers together and let's have a ministers conference and that's the way to do it that's really the most effective way to do it is go in have a conference with you know 100 ministers cuz if you have a you know link of the Philippines it was six seven hundred some people grow story on the church I need an effect I don't know if it was dirty preaches there's no when they got something they got it they're still getting it two years later they're still getting it and it's growing exponentially that way not maybe sometimes do the way okay he knows well as I do sure they love you because you're in America me because he's asking is that but when you leave they got to deal with in same ol Devils as they dealt with when you know the only emotion which brings you up and we're glad to have this one that's good word that's news if that's it but when you leave and go drop back down we lose we're going to pick it back up the preachers are gonna have to pick that thing back up and say oh I got this and now we're going to preach on this and now we're preaching on this and then we can preach on this to me that's the most important way of getting to people is through the ministry okay and it is and it can go both ways you can have some little like filters and I mean it's almost to have ministered meet one day at bill does not mean yes denial is the resurrection is all the web you know there's a lot of reason but you know better than that so what the word will what the word will bring the manifestation back around okay if it's of no use like those that somehow maintenance posited I've tried to help them I'm turning them over okay same thing with this message I'm telling you these seals are not for everybody these sealed sure we can all get new growth out of it but to get the fruition to get something that will put the fruit on the end of the tree we got to see that this is a natural happening and this is the spiritual happening okay all right because there is a certain thing called death of Hell I mean this power take a poor farmer killed with a sword with hunger with it we see that over in foreign countries they're killing them other thousands naturally why because of a spirit not because of a man we're not fighting men we're buying principalities powers spirits and not places that what the Bible said okay so we're fighting this same horse rider in the natural world but we're fighting this same horse rider in the spiritual world all right all right all right so this pale horse is what a mixture of all things he got a name now he's got a name remember the Bible says you got a name he called by what you did well son Holy Ghost baptism is dead that's what's probably God says he's the doctrine comes pizza hell but he went to dig up some this is the people that are baptized name puzzles no puzzles so you see what Donna yeah and and to bring this these fields coming from one two three the reason for is God we got to push everything while I'm trying to push everything are there it's because really five in its natural pure form is not to us six and our natural pure form is not to us but there is a spiritual application of five and six that there's something underneath in between the lines that we have to get back under these six the one two four is that confusing or that help good on it I mean it's a it takes all that to come back under this seal right here yeah this seal is not anything that work on a physically sick right you better not here and number six you better not be here glass the plays come in times 1 million you know I see that's the two prophets calling them just control the nature any way they want to but the reason like we were talking last night we were talking like a powerful ministry for those using weren't they will come at five fold ministry and we're talking about being prophetic this listen this is a prophetic days this is why you can no I don't like to use it word no because you can know about something growing I think there is a hammer but you get a revelation a prophetic revelation it for you as much as it is for the Bible mentions okay you can prophesied you can be prophetic yourself right as long as you stay under what you're supposed to be right and then as long as you stay under what sisters you can't preach the you can say this is what gets sticky you can't give me a revelation that's no preacher can give you right right no one can own one what cause it's prophetic it's coming straight down to you but it has to come through a file photo filter inside yes by a bold filter it has to come through that because you remember how many times you get you know you get a thought from God I'm doing the seal cuz we got to get this this is our this is our going home sale if I got this is our dope this is when the Seventh Seal produces itself to the Gentile alright the South still produces itself under the forcefield plumbing dent out there by clear with that alright so he's come here to produce yourself he's going to do away with death inhale this seal shows that death in half to death and he'll has got some kind of power but it can't be a powerless against that's going to overwhelm us right because we're going to overcome this power and we're going to leave come up that right there that's your bar from the change just worry about that but that is your bar from natural sumac it'll either take you to the supernatural or when it's destroyed we'll bring the supernatural here ok because to me that's the whole key the reason the 6th dimension can't come here because there's death here right but when death is destroyed in someone that says that program says death to come up your sleeve you when it means nothing here that's when they can come here and say there's still fear here because of the death because of that we die listen you die in this dimension if you pass away you pakil in this dimension and then whatever happens goes into another dimension five or six whichever one you say but that happened here but once death is destroyed here that's might destroy it in the force field not in five is it for us the guy for us I'm going to know from my kids an ash man come with the spiritual aspect of this 4-cyl is is that all this is together wrapped up into one it's just a second bathroom hose up and the word brother Brown says the word what would that quote Joe give us the other day man I was getting a word for the word was quoting the word cousin what the Jesus been Jesus quoted the old axle and he said it was the word quoting the word and the word in other words materialize out of the word so it's a word altogether because Jesus was standing that he wants the word he was quoting to learn he was quoting itself trying to say before Abraham one night he was he was the law that he was the leader before I ran the math in that Genesis 1:26 part we'll see this afternoon that was that was gone online you can't make them separate people if you may ever make yourself the Holy Ghost inside of you different from God you got to pee you got to beef it up right okay whatever I guess in 1:26 man was a part of God that was manifested in another form called a bride okay staying here this death is gone it's being it's being manifested here but now when what when we want that part away because look power was given unto them to do what they're doing so go ahead to watch from it that I were to happen so really I mean really now I'll read this afternoon brother Brown said when Jesus died he destroyed that he destroyed cancer he destroyed everything and he was he took your soul and your body under his rulership you - oh my lord yeah he did he claimed both of them at Calvary when he resurrected in that glorified body you resurrected with him now what we are doing is just make sure we believe that we'll talk about this afternoon but don't get burned on them but this pale horse death is hell followed with him that the main that sound on him was death comma and hell followed with him kind of orders that there's hell Hades shut so because remember there's no burning hell right man no remember stop talking now and there's no burning he'll run no there's a lake fire hell is to me hell is where God's not that's right okay I lived in Hell where loads up you know cuz I was work out one okay okay and that is the worst part is to know that you're in this place and can't get out what does what does the rich young ruler he said I would love to go to bosom Abraham what but laughter what he says you know there's a great gulf fixed Miller doesn't dimension that you can't come back across we can't come back into this dimension or you can't even go to the dimension that I'm in he said we'll tell my brothers or give me one temple of water for my column see he wasn't burning it would be wonderful to just go to mother would but if you were just a senator I'm just going to burn up since I'm getting you know soon as I get my judgment I'm gonna burn and I'll be gone done no it's going to be an ongoing thing it's going to be a process that you said someone goes through why because it's devoid God is nowhere to be saying there's no my brother instead it has no foundations with your skin oh I nearly had a dream that did you fail I had a dream that because that fell one time in a fitting will catch a hold of anything you know and you just keep telling me and it's horrible because you're trying to grab something there's nothing laughter that's my brother round and basically the same thing okay why is he killing with he's killing with a store now we know that naturally that that was happening but we know that spiritually he killed the worse by syrup spirit Authority right Satan word is what's killing people God word that killed anybody's board that not killing know God's Word is life okay now you guys kill the old anger you gotta cut out the old barge but when the word comes up like um Jesus was 11 he was the living word he lived the word that he was a friend with you and I you and I will live the word that we are all right hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth all right shall we come to now this is the prophetic or Eagle anointing all right so we're bringing in the fourth beast that fourth piece trust has this come and see so he says come here I want you to show you this John this is the last thing that you Gentiles are going to see then alright because we're not going to see the souls under the altar cry how long how long has been your blood let me see that we're almost see physically the two prophets I feel that in the word and in Revelation and in prophetic insight I looking can see what they're going to do one closer Bible probably going to send us a message to tell us exactly who they were the spirit of Moses beautiful eyes are coming on to you over there teaching the people basically this message when I'm saying baby but that first thing I'm doing get them to repent first you know you know they killed Jesus don't you have to repent first and then I don't know that they'll all come in together it doesn't matter they got three and a half years to get 144,000 doesn't matter if it takes three years five months in 28 days but God said like I said last anything go I'd give them 1260 days and that's all they get once they get that 12 hour 60 days the door shut they're done there's no more be safe than guns going to take them off the earth but see that's going to happen to them down here but what what we're going to do next Sunday I'm going to review this just now next time we're going to talk about 50 will may go back to the portal we'll talk about the fifth seal and talk about its natural happening so it's going to happen that but you're going to have to watch you watch this fifth seal open you're going to have to see the natural part that you got I mean the supernatural work that you do have the revelation the prophetic I'm telling you we are all prophetic because of the anointing that were under doesn't matter if you know that if you know what it you know what about hearing the name Lord Jesus Christ is correct that's prophetic because the world doesn't see it that way your prophetic if you can read the anointing that we're under when you read the Bible and you see that it was you know what happened in the garden okay you got it look at all the people that are blinded the man all these always doctors did we take that we say are our milk you know what happened the garden should be milk but - but there's somebody just coming in what a powerful revelation will entice me because really what's going to happen if they don't get it go job yeah how many people in deep trouble really by telling them that and then going yes well what you do is you choking them they can't take that strong need all right that's why we don't need to you know we are we don't need to force marriage and divorce and the seals and major doctrines don't force people with that don't even marriage and divorce should never be discussed listen outside of your home turf I'm gonna put it right down to the very wet outside of your home church managing divorce should never be discussed with those you're just casting pearls before swine you are wasting your time and I said local church because when your local assembly marriage and divorce is like they're the case could happen in this church that brother Dale would handle one way and another brother would handle another way another church that's his business this is our business so imagine divorced amazing all they discussed to me would be discussed among us you see our program positions for my people only now remember it did not set I think they had like 2400 people at the festival Scoob when he was preaching that or something like that it was several thousand now when he said additions to my own people only and you know don't got the vigil do it anymore he gave him the great American divorce now he didn't give 2,400 people as medicine woman is it most of that grace was given outside of the wall but it was given to someone like us that needed it in this room right man we were sitting there and some weren't even born of 1964 a little four-year-old kid you know you know say one thing for 65 seats for six months when he gives the grace of management divorce so what am I saying there's layers they some people took it you know what some people just get increased polygamy and it's still free completely off of that marriage in the wars book now that's not what he breaks free so that's not to them that's what it's just to the little elect that will catch what's going on number one get the grace of marriage and divorce inside first yeah then you work on the outside I imagine right because you're still making old husband in the world you're committed okay already yeah so get that set that's why did tell about Jesus Christ I'm up the saving grace Jesus Christ and what is that that is a great American boy that we were married to another man safe and then and if you know if you're not divorcing this guy he's going to be dated let brother Ram say god you're the one who can kill that old you can't kill it same can't kill your own maker he doesn't want it here that old nightmare but God the only one who can kill that whole nature and say you are now divorced are not divorce you are now free to marry whoever you wanted marry me I'm going to cross your Matt Christ come to me all ye that labor heavy labor I'll give you I'll be your husband I'll be the one talking about last night become a minister's preaching that didn't have home churches so music whatever may I understood that well that means that that he's just like a rogue preacher right everyone has to have met you we are all sheep I don't care if you are from Samuel Dale leave ale I'll go to your wedding you got to have some kind of head not sometimes you answer to and you know I will come a bit no but you got to have some times like brother they'll said he won't preach in I agree 100% he won't appreciate about it they're never on Church I was neither why because he's just a rogue guy he's just out here because you want to tell you real quick there brother Tim hymns is this possible then when he ain't our preaching he goes to that church he don't stay at home - boy I've been preaching for five days now I don't think I need to go to church no sir he's right there in that church so see ya to me that's a true evangelist a true person that comes into this job but he's got to have a home church that's why he got out of headship crisis our head wait but he clipped that many brother last night he gave us those five gifts to operate through and we must operate through those five years whether we be a hostile prophet recitation man we all got to work under the headship of his Christ man Christ is our head ok same way here we got to see that crises are they're not they're not just awful thing here and always other stuff that will be that will be illuminated in the right way but now remember see this is where you got eaten you've got to be able to think in different level death will not be destroyed until we until the future home but there has got to be destroyed and the horsetail in us before we can go in it for the world can go any further because remember they still gonna be deaf going on when we leave that alarm again then you go over to the end of the millennium saying it's going to raise up an army God is going to kill all them demons see there's death all the way through there but you know what there's a good staff and a bad bet the good death between Satan died and you okay mmm very good there but Paul to death where'd you stay great were you bigger that's what we got to look at right here let's go we'll be a little bit along this next night and then we'll come on this thing [Music] [Applause] [Music]
