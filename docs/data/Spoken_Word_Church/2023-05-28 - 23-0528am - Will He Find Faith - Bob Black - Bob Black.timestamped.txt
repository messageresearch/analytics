[17:50] Martin's this morning
[17:52] brother Ryan already mentioned that and
[17:54] uh and uh sister June doing well and I
[17:58] saw the pictures and everything of the
[18:00] little birthday party and everything so
[18:01] she that's wonderful to see her up and
[18:04] doing and and uh brother Ryan mentioned
[18:06] my dad so let me talk about my dad
[18:09] you know I I I I I I mentioned on the
[18:13] little chat that my my dad had
[18:15] my mom was out in the out in the yard
[18:18] and and she noticed that he's his face
[18:20] side of his face was drooping and he
[18:22] wasn't able to respond to her questions
[18:23] and looked like something something was
[18:26] happening so she took him to the ER and
[18:28] you know everybody was real worried and
[18:30] everything but um we certainly thank
[18:32] everybody for your prayers what happened
[18:34] was when he got to the hospital you know
[18:35] that he wasn't able to answer the
[18:37] neurologist questions right and
[18:38] everything but
[18:40] um prayer got to working and something
[18:42] began to happen
[18:43] because the next day he he was fine they
[18:47] did an MRA MRI
[18:52] and I'm not just trying to you know
[18:55] exaggerate or nothing I they did an MRI
[18:57] and he they said that he got the brain
[18:59] of a 30 year old they couldn't find any
[19:00] kind of evidence of a stroke or anything
[19:02] in his brain
[19:03] um they you know they're telling him you
[19:05] know he just needs to stay on some blood
[19:06] thinners and things but as far as you
[19:08] know that's that's concerned everything
[19:10] looks fine and you know I think we've
[19:12] been we've been seeing a lot of things
[19:15] lately God moving on the scene and
[19:17] testimonies and it sure is good to see
[19:19] evidence of Faith working and I sure I
[19:22] just I just can't thank God enough for
[19:23] his goodness to us
[19:25] so at this morning I want to talk to you
[19:27] about Willie Find Faith because we've
[19:29] been kind of studying in Sunday school
[19:30] about faith and uh you know to think
[19:33] about that question will he find Faith
[19:35] so before we read in Luke chapter 18
[19:37] verses 1 to 8 let's just go to the Lord
[19:39] in prayer
[19:41] Lord we're so grateful to you Lord that
[19:43] to wait to know that we have a God that
[19:45] answers back that responds to our faith
[19:47] in you that you didn't just give us a
[19:49] word that'll fall to the ground and
[19:50] return void that you gave us a word a
[19:53] gospel that will do something and you
[19:55] promised us that it will accomplish his
[19:56] purpose Lord Jesus if we'll just let it
[19:58] fall into the ground of our heart it'll
[20:00] come up and it'll produce something
[20:01] that'll produce a change in her life
[20:03] it'll produce healing in our bodies
[20:04] it'll produce a sound mind and joy in
[20:07] our life Lord God and I pray Lord that
[20:09] you're just Lord let your word go forth
[20:12] to your people and minister to whatever
[20:13] the needs that they have this morning
[20:14] Lord you know all of our needs Lord you
[20:17] know what we have need of Lord Jesus and
[20:18] I pray God it is the word is spoken that
[20:20] it'll be Lord you'll have Liberty Lord
[20:22] among Among Us and just build our faith
[20:24] up Lord to the place where we can
[20:25] believe the promises that you have given
[20:27] unto us that are laying here in this
[20:29] word Lord in this in this Bible that we
[20:31] all claim to believe Lord Jesus build up
[20:33] our faith we ask granted Lord did you
[20:35] just be with us this morning Lord Jesus
[20:37] be with all of your Saints be with the
[20:39] the brother Wade and brother Louise
[20:41] they're ministering for Brother Martin
[20:42] or this morning I pray God he shall give
[20:44] them a special outpouring a special
[20:46] blessing this morning Lord granted Lord
[20:48] that you'll just be with us Lord in this
[20:50] house we pray in your name amen
[20:54] now I'm gonna just try to take it slow
[20:57] this morning
[20:59] in Luke chapter 18 and verse 1 to 8
[21:01] let's just meditate on these words as we
[21:03] read
[21:04] it says
[21:06] Jesus gave this little parable
[21:08] and he spoke a parable unto them to this
[21:10] end
[21:11] that men always to pray
[21:14] and not to faint
[21:17] saying that was in City a judge which
[21:20] feared not God
[21:21] neither regarding man
[21:23] and there was a widow in that City
[21:25] and she came unto him saying avenge me
[21:27] of my adversary
[21:29] and he would not for a while but
[21:31] afterward he said within himself though
[21:33] I fear not God nor a guard man yet
[21:36] because this Widow troubleth me I will
[21:38] avenge her list by her continual coming
[21:40] she weary me
[21:43] and the Lord said hear what the unjust
[21:45] judge saith and shall not God avenge his
[21:49] own elect which cried day and night unto
[21:51] him though he bear along with them
[21:53] I tell you that he will avenge them
[21:55] speedily
[21:57] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[21:59] shall he find faith on the earth he may
[22:02] be seated the Lord at his Blessing to
[22:04] the reading of the word
[22:07] now you think about that this morning
[22:09] brother Brown said when when he was
[22:11] explaining this scripture he said that
[22:13] you know God's not looking for to see
[22:15] who's coming to church or who's real
[22:17] religious and he kind of went down
[22:18] through the list of all the different
[22:19] things that what God is looking for is
[22:22] Faith and to think about this morning
[22:23] that that if you really want to please
[22:25] God that just show him your faith let
[22:27] his let your faith be observable to God
[22:30] that's that's the really the thing that
[22:32] makes God happy when God speaks a word
[22:35] out
[22:36] and it falls into the good ground of
[22:38] your heart and you say I believe that I
[22:41] believe that it's you see that's what
[22:42] that's what we come to church for that's
[22:44] what we gather together to hear the
[22:45] preaching of the Gospel to stir up our
[22:47] faith to a place where we say you know
[22:49] what I I do believe I believe that God
[22:52] cares about me I believe that I believe
[22:54] that these promises that he told I
[22:55] believe that there's healing that's
[22:57] laying in the Bible and I believe that
[22:59] this promise that God made is for me oh
[23:02] you see that's what with something when
[23:03] you really begin to glue lay claim to
[23:06] God's promise something begins to work
[23:09] and you think about this this story that
[23:11] Jesus is explaining about this woman
[23:13] that that she something that happened to
[23:15] her in her life maybe maybe we'll say it
[23:17] like this maybe maybe just put it in
[23:19] present day maybe her Joy got stole
[23:21] maybe somebody stole stole some of her
[23:23] lands her possessions something
[23:24] something maybe if we'll say maybe
[23:26] something that God had promised to her
[23:28] maybe some you know she she had a
[23:30] possession that that her that had been
[23:32] passed down through generations and that
[23:34] was hers and somebody come in and stole
[23:35] it from her and she had to go before the
[23:37] judge that she was saying it was mine
[23:40] and somebody stole it you got to pay you
[23:42] got you got to make it make this right
[23:44] and it was a in the story it's an unjust
[23:47] judge a judge that's sitting up there
[23:49] that didn't know God and doesn't doesn't
[23:51] know doesn't care about man doesn't care
[23:53] about maybe this little widow woman
[23:55] that's that's got this real problem but
[23:57] to think now that this widow woman that
[23:59] would come and would implea implore
[24:01] you've got to make this right that God
[24:04] is saying that if we'll come with that
[24:06] same kind of a confidence the same kind
[24:08] of a confidence coming to God if if that
[24:11] unjust judge if that unjust judge would
[24:13] make it right just to get that woman
[24:15] away to make her go away what will God
[24:17] do to to to to to somebody that comes
[24:21] with confidence that he's going to
[24:23] fulfill his promise with faith in his
[24:25] word how will God reward that you only
[24:28] to think about that God
[24:29] Jesus was was telling us this story to
[24:32] stir up within us to stir up within us
[24:34] that we should have confidence to know
[24:37] that God will reward will reward our
[24:40] faith isn't that what Paul was saying
[24:42] there in Hebrews 11 that that you've got
[24:44] to have faith in God you've got to have
[24:47] faith that he is a rewarder of them that
[24:49] diligently seek Him you've got to have
[24:51] confidence that if you need something
[24:53] from God that he will reward you I I
[24:56] want to say this morning maybe it may be
[24:57] somebody's maybe maybe you you aren't
[24:59] able to pay your bills you got to have
[25:01] confidence that God will come on the
[25:03] scene and and work a miracle in your
[25:05] life you've got to have confidence
[25:06] that's the kind of faith that we can
[25:09] have oh you go back and listen to that
[25:11] first message that brother Brown ever
[25:12] preached the faith is the substance and
[25:14] he laid it out how strong that faith
[25:16] faith if you really know what faith is
[25:19] faith will take an obstacle and move it
[25:22] out of the way faith if you've got great
[25:24] big old faith that might start as a
[25:27] little Mustard Seed but you let it grow
[25:28] up big enough faith faith faith it will
[25:30] move move any obstacle out of the way
[25:33] you got a problem at work it'll move it
[25:35] out of the way you got a problem in your
[25:37] family it'll move it out of the way
[25:38] faith will overcome any obstacle
[25:42] now the question that Jesus is asking
[25:44] there nevertheless when the son of man
[25:45] cometh shall he find faith on the earth
[25:48] oh you think about this morning now that
[25:50] God God is watching this congregation
[25:53] God he's he's moving just like in those
[25:54] meetings when brother Brandon was
[25:56] speaking now of course certainly we
[25:58] don't we don't compare at all to the
[26:00] ministry that brother Branham had but
[26:01] yet we're preaching the same thing that
[26:03] he preached and in his ministry that the
[26:05] pillar of fire would move over the
[26:07] congregation and move and he'd say there
[26:09] it goes and watch it and I believe
[26:11] within my heart that what that Pillar of
[26:13] Fire was doing was watching for Faith
[26:15] where can I find somebody that will
[26:16] believe the words that are being spoken
[26:18] where can I find somebody that'll that
[26:21] will believe when all in the world all
[26:23] that Pentecostal age all the
[26:25] denominations turned their head and said
[26:26] we don't want nothing that you've got
[26:28] but yet there were little people sitting
[26:30] out there in that congregation that said
[26:31] I'll take it I'll believe it and that's
[26:34] what the pillar of fire was looking for
[26:36] that's what God is looking for this
[26:38] morning I I was I got a the privilege to
[26:41] talk to brother William and he was here
[26:42] in my home and and we got you know
[26:45] you're just sitting around talking and
[26:46] we were talking about how that in many
[26:48] meetings that they've been in and many
[26:50] many people many ministers have began to
[26:52] notice while they're preaching the
[26:54] gospel they'll be an angel standing on
[26:56] the platform you see this we're
[26:57] preaching a supernatural gospel where
[27:00] God is still manifest in the in the
[27:02] meeting and that they would say he asked
[27:04] he had the privilege to ask a brother
[27:07] when you looked over there and you saw
[27:09] that angel standing on the platform
[27:11] watching the people as you were
[27:12] preaching with his arms folded and
[27:14] listen it's this happens frequently I
[27:16] just want to stir up your faith this
[27:17] morning but he would say what would the
[27:19] angel be doing and he said watching the
[27:21] people now you think this morning that
[27:23] there could be Angels moving down the
[27:25] aisles this morning watching you
[27:27] watching you to see what's going to
[27:28] happen one time he was he he said he was
[27:31] at a meeting and there was an angel a
[27:33] brother nudged at one brother and he
[27:35] said look there's an angel over there
[27:36] and he looked and there was an angel on
[27:38] the platform and the angel was standing
[27:39] there watching the people and he stood
[27:41] there until the preacher happened to
[27:43] move over where the angel was and then
[27:44] the crowd just erupted because the
[27:47] Angels there to recognize your faith the
[27:49] Angels there to do something God is
[27:51] looking to see if there's anybody that
[27:53] wants to believe him and he could be
[27:55] standing here this morning and looking
[27:57] to see if there's somebody that will
[27:59] take him at his word up don't you
[28:00] realize that morning this morning that
[28:02] if you believe if you have faith in what
[28:05] God promised something will happen that
[28:08] your healing could be manifested in your
[28:10] body or you say well it's just for your
[28:12] dad it's your dad's the only one that
[28:14] can be healed if you see one person
[28:16] being healed it can happen to anybody if
[28:18] you see one person receiving the Holy
[28:20] Ghost you could claim it oh that should
[28:23] stir up our faith to believe well if
[28:24] somebody if that person over there can
[28:26] get it why not me oh without faith you
[28:30] cannot please God that's the only way to
[28:32] please God or you say well I'm I've
[28:34] gotta I've got a good track record for
[28:36] coming to church I've showed up my
[28:37] attendance streak is really good I've
[28:40] been here for the last 40 years and I've
[28:41] been here but but without faith you
[28:43] can't please God without faith your
[28:45] attendant streak does not mean nothing
[28:47] to God without faith your your tithe
[28:50] pain doesn't mean nothing to God without
[28:52] faith you're paying the parking lot and
[28:54] painting the building and putting
[28:55] shingles on the place and maybe even
[28:57] helping people not do nothing for good
[28:59] doesn't mean nothing to God without
[29:01] faith you cannot please God faith is the
[29:04] only way that you can please God oh
[29:06] you've got to believe God's word oh
[29:08] there's some benefits tied up in this oh
[29:11] there's some benefits that you can reap
[29:12] by believing God's word if you believe
[29:14] he's still a Healer you can be healed if
[29:16] you and I'm not just trying to trying to
[29:18] excite you I'm trying to stir up your
[29:20] faith because brother random sin oh he
[29:24] said if you can have faith as a mustard
[29:26] seed you can move a mountain and if a
[29:28] mustard seed faith will move a mountain
[29:30] there in faith is the substance he said
[29:32] how much little less Faith would it take
[29:35] to move that little bracelet hanging
[29:36] there in the room
[29:38] if you've never read that sermon before
[29:40] I I encourage you to do that he's
[29:42] talking to that little sister there in
[29:43] the room and he said if you got you say
[29:45] you've got all Faith well move that
[29:46] little bracelet that's hanging there and
[29:48] he he moved and concentrated on it and
[29:50] moved it and she said how did you move
[29:51] it and he said he said she said who who
[29:55] moved that was it the devil was it God
[29:57] he said no I moved it now you didn't
[29:59] think think that your favorite see that
[30:01] just go goes over our head to think that
[30:03] faith is so powerful that your little
[30:06] faith your faith can move an obstacle
[30:09] your faith can change something and he
[30:11] said if faith is a mustard seed could
[30:13] move a mountain how much little less
[30:15] Faith would it take just to move
[30:17] something like that
[30:18] oh to think now that he said if you're a
[30:21] pocket knife hitting in your pocket
[30:22] faith will put it there and that
[30:24] stumbles us now that stumbles us but it
[30:25] it's yet it's true because the prophet
[30:27] we believe the prophet don't we
[30:29] we believe the prophet y'all don't draw
[30:31] up on me now
[30:33] we believe the things that he said is
[30:35] true faithful faith will do something
[30:37] Hebrews 11 6 says but without faith it
[30:40] is impossible to please him for he that
[30:42] cometh to God must believe that he is
[30:44] and that he is what a rewarder of them
[30:46] that diligently seek him now that's what
[30:49] we fail to recognize sometimes that God
[30:51] will reward our faith now you think
[30:52] about this little this little woman in
[30:54] this Parable the little Widow that that
[30:55] she didn't have a husband that she could
[30:57] turn to and do go to battle for with it
[31:00] with the judge but she just come up
[31:01] there by herself and started troubling
[31:04] the judge and telling him I I I've lost
[31:06] something out to see if this morning if
[31:08] you've lost if you've lost your joy you
[31:10] just believe that God will give you back
[31:11] and he'll give it back if you this
[31:13] morning if you've lost your children if
[31:15] the devil has taken away your children
[31:16] you believe that God will give them back
[31:18] to you you see I remember Ron Spencer
[31:21] preached one time he preached a sermon
[31:22] take back it's time to take back where
[31:24] the devil stole and I think we can have
[31:26] confidence with Faith by faith that if
[31:28] the devil's taking something from you
[31:30] that you've got a right to go and claim
[31:32] what the devil stole from you you've got
[31:34] to write like this little widow woman to
[31:36] come and and making them make your
[31:38] appeal to the judge make your appeal to
[31:40] God and say come on the scene for me I
[31:42] need you to come on the scene now God
[31:45] will reward a little if an unjust judge
[31:47] will reward a little winner woman that
[31:48] is an aggravation what about a real
[31:52] child or daughter of God that comes by
[31:54] face believing in a god that is touched
[31:57] by the feelings of our infirmities
[31:58] believing in a God who is the
[32:00] heartbreast of our confession oh you
[32:02] should have confidence didn't Paul tell
[32:04] us to come boldly come boldly to the
[32:06] throne of grace recognizing that we've
[32:09] got somebody that's a help to us
[32:11] brother Brahman he said he said in
[32:13] accepting God's provided a way of the
[32:15] end time
[32:16] he said cry for your knees that's God's
[32:18] provided away I didn't Jesus explain it
[32:21] when he said the unjust judge to the
[32:22] woman that cried day and night how much
[32:25] more will the heavenly father give than
[32:26] the spirit who cry out for it day and
[32:28] night oh my you think now this morning
[32:31] and if you're if you're if you're
[32:32] seeking deliverance from the things of
[32:34] this world you've got to promise that
[32:36] God God wants to give it to you more
[32:37] than you want than you want it if you're
[32:40] seeking the new birth
[32:41] and everybody's telling you and the
[32:43] devil's telling you it's too late for
[32:44] you to get it you just keep knocking
[32:46] keep seeking that's what he said seek
[32:48] keep seek and not keep knocking just
[32:50] keep on till he opens stay out with it
[32:54] cry until the promised word is
[32:56] Vindicated then you got it you don't
[32:58] have to worry no more you see the Bible
[33:00] promised it then stay right there and
[33:03] cry until you get it now now that's what
[33:06] our problem is we back off from the
[33:08] promise we come to church and we just
[33:10] kind of get into our little State we
[33:12] feel like we're we're doing our our
[33:14] weekly uh
[33:15] we like I think it was William or
[33:18] somebody said checking it off our list
[33:20] but and and we failed to just press into
[33:23] the promise oh if you could recognize
[33:25] that if you press if you persevere God
[33:28] will give it to you to think about that
[33:30] now whatever whatever promise you can
[33:32] find laying in the Bible you you got to
[33:34] have something to base your faith on and
[33:35] what we base our faith on is the word of
[33:37] God so if you can find it in the word
[33:39] lay in there you persevere until you get
[33:41] it like Abraham he just kept pressing on
[33:44] believing believing for 25 years that
[33:46] God promised him a child that God
[33:48] promised him he'd be the father of
[33:50] Nations that God promised him his seed
[33:52] would possess the Gate of their enemy
[33:54] and he just pressed on through all that
[33:56] oh you think this morning that God gave
[33:58] you that same promise that his seed will
[34:00] possess the Gate of their enemy so you
[34:02] got that same promise so whenever you
[34:04] see the enemy's gate coming up against
[34:06] you you press on and say oh maybe in
[34:08] your little prayer closet you say oh God
[34:10] you're the one that made the promise you
[34:12] made the promising you've got to make a
[34:14] way and Faith begins to go to work
[34:16] something begins to happen something
[34:18] begins to move you begin to call upon
[34:20] God and say I know you made the promise
[34:22] for my children I know you made the
[34:24] promise I got something wrong in my body
[34:26] I need it I need healing I need a touch
[34:28] from you so that I can preach your
[34:30] gospel that I can serve you so that I
[34:31] can be a real testimony of what you are
[34:34] and who you are shout them begin to go
[34:36] to work oh you got to persevere Church
[34:38] you got to press in press on to the mark
[34:42] of the high calling in Christ this
[34:43] kingdom is taken by force not just a
[34:45] little haphazard not just a little well
[34:47] I'm just going to go to church and
[34:49] that'll be it but you got to press on
[34:52] brother bear said when you hear that God
[34:54] made a promise
[34:55] [Applause]
[34:57] when you hear that God made a promise be
[35:00] persevered to see it come to pass oh how
[35:04] many of us could say it you don't have
[35:05] to raise your hands but just think
[35:06] inwardly how many of you know that
[35:08] there's a promise laying there in the
[35:10] Bible that you want to see come to pass
[35:11] you want to see it come to pass and
[35:14] maybe you've just backed off from that
[35:15] promise and you said well maybe one day
[35:17] it's going to happen but oh if we could
[35:19] just really we just push forward and say
[35:22] God I I want to see it now I want to see
[35:24] the healing in my body I want to see I I
[35:27] know that you're the one who made the
[35:28] promise brother I'm said job look at job
[35:31] when he was afflicted soars all over him
[35:34] he was all in the plan of God but job
[35:36] too was persevering because he know that
[35:39] he was keeping God's word nothing was
[35:41] going to bother him oh you think about
[35:43] that little woman that Jesus called a
[35:45] dog he's he said I'm sent to the
[35:47] children of God and you're nothing but a
[35:49] bunch of dogs but he said you know Faith
[35:51] she held on she was persistent
[35:53] persevered oh that's what perseverance
[35:56] does when somebody says something wrong
[35:57] to you when somebody somebody said
[36:00] something to put a block in front of you
[36:01] but yeah you know you read it in the
[36:03] Bible somewhere and you're just going to
[36:05] persevere and hang on to what God Said
[36:07] oh listen all of us we look back in our
[36:11] spiritual journey you look back to when
[36:12] God gave you the Holy Ghost that's my
[36:14] testimony when I was seeking the Holy
[36:16] Ghost people would tell me that I
[36:18] couldn't do it if I wasn't in this
[36:19] person's specific genealogy or that was
[36:22] all these reasons why it wasn't for you
[36:24] laid reasons down before you but you
[36:26] look into the word and you claim it with
[36:28] perseverance recognizing that if God
[36:30] made the promise he's able to fulfill it
[36:33] the whole thing about little David that
[36:35] he was anointed by Samuel and and he
[36:38] knew that he wasn't going to die he knew
[36:40] that if God had delivered him from The
[36:41] Lion and from the bear that he was more
[36:43] than able to deliver that Philistine
[36:45] that uncircumcised Philistine into his
[36:47] hands and he went forth with
[36:49] perseverance with faith faith knowing
[36:52] that that same God that was with him
[36:54] with the lion and the bear was going to
[36:56] be with him when he fought the Goliath
[36:57] and brother Brown said he grabbed up his
[36:59] little slingshot and went and brought
[37:01] that sheet back by killing the lion why
[37:03] he was persevering he killed slew
[37:06] Goliath because he was persevered
[37:09] you got to be steadfast you got to be
[37:12] persevering you got to take your faith
[37:15] and claim what your god-given right is
[37:17] take your faith and hold it up over the
[37:19] over what God Said and lay it out there
[37:21] and James chapter 1 it said James said
[37:24] blessed is the man who remains steadfast
[37:26] under trial for when he has stood the
[37:29] test he will receive the Crown of Life
[37:31] which God has promised to those who love
[37:33] him
[37:34] in James chapter 5 said behold we
[37:36] consider those blessed Who Remain
[37:38] steadfast you have heard of the
[37:40] steadfastness of job and you have seen
[37:42] the purpose of the Lord
[37:44] how the Lord is compassionate and
[37:46] merciful oh you you got to you got when
[37:50] you see a promise of God you grab a hold
[37:52] to it and you just lay claim to it and
[37:54] say God this is mine Hebrews chapter 10
[37:57] said for you have need of endurance so
[37:59] that when you have done the will of God
[38:01] you may receive what is Promised oh to
[38:04] think about that endurance now endurance
[38:06] is that that mundane that brother Louise
[38:09] was preaching about on Wednesday night
[38:11] the mundane that that that slowed slog
[38:15] up the statue of a perfect man well
[38:17] you're you're yoked up to the ox you're
[38:19] under the ox anointing and you're going
[38:21] up and you're just you're going through
[38:22] endurance you have need of endurance
[38:25] Paul says so that when you have done the
[38:27] will of God you may receive what is
[38:28] promised that slog like like like Abel
[38:32] when he brought his sacrifice up there
[38:33] but just believe even believe in that
[38:35] God would come on the scene and accept
[38:37] his sacrifice coming coming with his
[38:41] faith believing that God will come on
[38:43] the scene and God accepted it went by
[38:45] fire
[38:46] in First Corinthians chapter 15 it says
[38:48] therefore my beloved brother is be
[38:50] steadfast and movable always abounding
[38:53] in the work of the Lord knowing that in
[38:54] the work that in the Lord your labor is
[38:57] not in vain oh that's that's an
[39:00] encouragement to any preacher to know
[39:01] that their labor is not in vain many
[39:03] times we preach and preach and not see
[39:05] seems like nothing's really moving but
[39:07] yet something's working because the word
[39:09] will have an effect in people's lives
[39:11] many times you don't see it many times
[39:13] it looks maybe maybe it may be
[39:14] disappointing but there's an
[39:17] encouragement in the words that to be
[39:19] steadfast and movable knowing that in
[39:21] the Lord your labor is not in vain in
[39:25] Galatians chapter 6 verse 9 says and let
[39:27] us not grow weary of doing good for in
[39:29] due season we will reap if we do not
[39:32] give up
[39:33] oh you think about how many times in the
[39:36] Bible Paul and all the all the apostles
[39:39] encouraged us to not give up to just
[39:41] keep pressing on to just keep pressing
[39:44] on toward the mark of the high calling
[39:45] in Christ and not grow weird don't grow
[39:47] weary of saying good things to other
[39:49] people don't grow weary of coming to
[39:51] church don't grow weary because in due
[39:53] season the fruit is going to come up
[39:55] it's going to produce it's going to
[39:57] ripen it's going to produce a harvest in
[40:00] Romans chapter 5 verses 3 to 4 we
[40:02] rejoice in our sufferings knowing that
[40:05] suffering produces endurance
[40:07] and endurance produces character and
[40:09] character produces hope oh you've got to
[40:12] endure you've got to endure to get the
[40:14] prize
[40:15] I was talking to my brother at work he's
[40:18] been running those uh he's been running
[40:19] marathons recently
[40:21] I think I mentioned that before but he
[40:23] he you know he just to talk to him about
[40:26] running America the ultra marathons like
[40:28] not not 26 miles but like 50 miles
[40:30] through the woods or whatever running
[40:32] through the dark in the middle of the
[40:33] night and you got to have endurance then
[40:35] that's why Paul said to run this race
[40:37] run this race well you start you start
[40:39] off the race but in the middle in the
[40:42] middle of the night one time he actually
[40:43] did that he got tired and he just pulled
[40:45] off and he said after about 30 miles he
[40:47] said I I'm done but you see God don't
[40:50] want us to be that kind of a Christian
[40:51] to just get get halfway and just say
[40:54] well I'm done I can't go anymore but you
[40:56] got to persevere press on toward the
[40:58] mark of the high calling in Christ press
[41:00] on press on toward what we get we get
[41:02] seems like sometimes we'll get weary and
[41:04] tired about what we're doing here what
[41:06] are we doing here we're pressing on for
[41:07] the Capstone pressing on to the to the
[41:10] unveiling of the Seven Seals to give us
[41:12] rapturing Faith so don't just cabbage
[41:14] down and say well I got it all I'm I'm
[41:16] good but press on why because faith
[41:19] faith wants the outcome faith wants a
[41:22] body change faith wants to see God do
[41:25] something in your life
[41:27] and Hebrews chapter 12 Paul said
[41:29] therefore since we are surrounded by so
[41:31] great a cloud of witnesses let us lay
[41:33] aside also every way and sin which
[41:36] clings so closely and let us run with
[41:38] endurance the race that is set before us
[41:40] looking to Jesus the founder and
[41:42] Perfecter of our faith who for the joy
[41:45] that was set before him endured the
[41:46] cross despising the shame and is seated
[41:49] at the right hand of the Throne of God
[41:52] oh you think all these promises lay in
[41:54] here about somebody that will seek in
[41:56] Luke chapter 11 he said I say unto you
[41:58] ask and it shall be given you seek and
[42:00] ye shall find knock and it shall be
[42:02] opened unto you for everyone that asketh
[42:05] receiveth and he that seeketh findeth
[42:07] unto him that knocketh it shall be open
[42:09] I wonder if we could ask that question
[42:11] this morning just down in our hearts if
[42:13] if there's something if if you want a
[42:15] further revelation of the of the of of
[42:17] this of the message have you asked God
[42:19] for it have you sought God for it or if
[42:21] you just kind of come to church and said
[42:23] well it's good enough for me to be here
[42:24] it's good enough for me to just check
[42:26] check it off my list but if you got
[42:28] along with God and said God I need to
[42:30] know I I you know I going along my
[42:33] Christian Journey I've seen people cry
[42:35] and get all frustrated because they
[42:37] don't understand Daniel 70 weeks and get
[42:39] all frustrated and you know that I think
[42:41] that's a good thing I think that's a
[42:43] thing that should be encouraged we
[42:45] should we should want it so bad that we
[42:48] we cry when we don't see it because
[42:49] that's somebody that'll get to Knocking
[42:51] you get to to knocking on the door of
[42:53] Christ getting on the on the door get
[42:56] knocking on the door of his promises and
[42:58] God there's God said he would open it up
[43:00] to you now he said now if you notice it
[43:03] isn't just Lord I want it he that asketh
[43:05] seeketh keep on seeking keep on knocking
[43:09] just keep on on you've arrived there so
[43:12] just keep on knocking till it happens I
[43:15] believe it Lord I'm on your hands
[43:18] I'm on your hands oh if we could just be
[43:21] persist persistent
[43:23] be persistent like Ruth who said I'm not
[43:25] going back where I came from I'm not
[43:27] going back I like I like what brother
[43:30] Louise said on Wednesday night I'm not
[43:31] going back I'm going forward I I I I I'm
[43:35] going on David persisted with when he
[43:38] went got to Goliath shamgars find the
[43:41] promise of God that the land was for him
[43:43] and he he grabbed up that Ox goat and
[43:45] who went after his promise because he
[43:47] persisted with by faith believing that
[43:50] God is the one that made the promise
[43:52] Abraham going on for 25 years persisting
[43:55] and Moses who who 40 years through the
[43:59] Wilderness persisted to believe God's
[44:01] word and and to find that promise
[44:04] all these promises that we're laying
[44:06] here all these examples of great faith
[44:09] people that would would persist and
[44:11] believe what God had said
[44:13] brother said just keep on knocking just
[44:16] keep on seeking just keep on on and Luke
[44:20] chapter 11 if a son shall ask any bread
[44:22] of you that is a father will he give him
[44:24] a stone or if he ask a fish will he for
[44:26] a fish give him a serpent or if he shall
[44:29] ask an egg will he offer him a scorpion
[44:31] if ye then being evil know how to give
[44:33] good gifts unto your children how much
[44:35] more shall your heavenly father give the
[44:37] Holy Spirit to them that ask him what's
[44:40] Jesus doing building up our faith oh you
[44:43] see that's what happens as the preaching
[44:44] Goes Forth it something begins to stir
[44:46] within your soul to know that God cares
[44:48] about you think that God cares about you
[44:50] you might have got to a place in your
[44:51] life where you think well God just don't
[44:52] care about me anymore but God still
[44:54] cares God still cares about that gift in
[44:57] your life to minister to the church he
[44:59] still cares about that gift in your life
[45:00] to play the piano or to sing songs he
[45:02] still cares and he ain't forgotten about
[45:04] you he cares about you and if we could
[45:06] if our face could just be built up to
[45:08] recognize that we've got a God that will
[45:11] reward our faith that he cares about us
[45:13] we you've got a God that answers prayer
[45:15] to think about that when you get it down
[45:17] on your knees your prayer is not in vain
[45:19] that there's somebody that listens and
[45:21] hears and will answer back that's why
[45:24] the Bible says pray without ceasing pray
[45:26] you praying will do something praying
[45:28] will accomplish something you get down
[45:30] on your knees in faith or pacing around
[45:32] like the Bible says I stand praying
[45:34] whatever whatever way God will reward
[45:37] perseverant faith
[45:40] Jesus is saying God rewards perseverant
[45:42] Faith but will the son of man be able to
[45:44] find anyone that believes that
[45:47] oh you think about this morning
[45:49] we got a lot of people that come to
[45:50] church
[45:51] you got a lot of people that congregate
[45:53] around Believers I got to read a thread
[45:55] online a message thread of just people
[45:58] talking about all the all the different
[45:59] churches that they've been to just
[46:01] denominational people seeking seeking a
[46:03] good church to go to and you you think
[46:05] about think about the condition of the
[46:07] world that it's gotten into where
[46:09] churches now they've got light shows and
[46:11] and fog machines and I I was reading one
[46:14] person said they went to a church and it
[46:16] was a woman preacher got up and they
[46:18] just read real quick a scripture and
[46:19] then they looked like they had like an
[46:20] advertisement playing on the screen and
[46:22] nothing nothing really pertaining to God
[46:24] at all and that's what this the God of
[46:26] this evil age is calls that's why Jesus
[46:28] could say back then he said when the son
[46:30] of man comes will will he find faith is
[46:32] he going to find somebody that believes
[46:34] now
[46:35] oh you elevate that on what what's God
[46:37] looking for in this day God is looking
[46:39] for somebody that where the faith the
[46:41] faith has been built up built up from
[46:43] Luther's preaching and Wesley's
[46:45] preaching to the Azusa Pentecost to
[46:47] brother random is preaching to restore
[46:48] us back to the original Faith the
[46:51] original faith of the apostolic fathers
[46:53] to believe the word for their age that's
[46:56] what God is looking for in this age
[46:58] somebody that will believe what he's
[47:00] saying somebody that will believe that
[47:01] we're going to take a body change
[47:02] somebody that will believe what like
[47:04] brother Ryan was preaching this uh
[47:06] talking about this morning that that
[47:07] that the statue of a perfect man is not
[47:10] out of our reach that God has given us
[47:12] the recipe for these things he's given
[47:14] us the recipe to come into perfect
[47:16] Oneness perfect Unity with him
[47:19] oh God wants to see our faith God wants
[47:22] to see us God wants to see us
[47:24] enthusiastic about the word excited
[47:26] about the word wanting to see the word
[47:27] made manifest in our life not just tired
[47:30] about it not just all drawn up about it
[47:32] and saying well I'm just going through
[47:33] but if you've got as Jesus said if
[47:36] you've got faith as a grain of mustard
[47:39] seed ye shall say unto this mountain
[47:42] remove hints to Yonder place
[47:45] another place he said if you had Faith
[47:48] as a grain of mustard seed you might say
[47:50] to this sycamore tree be thou plucked it
[47:52] by the root and be thou planted in the
[47:54] sea and it should obey you Now isn't
[47:58] that the same thing brother Ryan will
[47:59] say and what he said if you got faith
[48:00] you can move you can move the little
[48:02] thing hang in there in the room if
[48:04] you've got faith it'll put the pocket
[48:06] knife in your pocket now how many of us
[48:08] have testimonies that we can relate to
[48:10] and say I remember when that was
[48:13] manifested in my life
[48:15] I remember I remember brother in South
[48:17] Carolina brother Al Arnett talking about
[48:18] him and Pat Tyler were riding on the
[48:20] road and they lost their keys and they
[48:22] prayed they leaned over the hood of
[48:23] their car they said we need our key and
[48:25] they asked God to give them their keys
[48:26] back and they they raised up from off
[48:28] the hood of the car and the keys were
[48:29] sitting there right where they had been
[48:31] praying how many of you have the same
[48:33] kind of testimony where you lost your
[48:35] keys or you lost your wallet and you
[48:36] prayed and Faith what was it Faith put
[48:39] it there no you see you think it's out
[48:40] of your reach but you believe and you've
[48:43] got your own testimony where God did the
[48:45] same thing you believe
[48:50] oh oh you you have a need in your body
[48:54] and you believe you're sitting there in
[48:55] church and as the words going forth is
[48:57] being preached and Faith takes a hold
[48:59] and something happens and you get up and
[49:01] your backache's gone and you get up and
[49:03] your kidney problems gone and you get up
[49:04] and your kidney Stone's gone because
[49:06] what faith took a hold faith will do it
[49:09] now Faith just is a grain of mustard
[49:11] seed can move a mountain now brother
[49:13] Brown said he'd say now you start off
[49:15] you might start off with just a little
[49:16] Mustard Seed of Faith but you keep what
[49:18] do you keep adding you keep adding the
[49:20] word and it'll keep growing oh how many
[49:22] don't have to raise your hand but how
[49:24] many wants your faith to grow this
[49:26] morning how many would want your faith
[49:28] to grow
[49:30] so I I want to encourage you this you
[49:34] got this little Mustard Seed Faith this
[49:35] morning it don't have to stay a little
[49:37] Mustard Seed but you know if you that's
[49:39] if that's all you got mustard seeds
[49:41] faith will accomplish a lot just a
[49:44] little Mustard Seed Faith if you just
[49:45] keep hanging on and hanging on
[49:47] eventually you're going to see that
[49:49] mountain move but if you've got great
[49:51] big faith in the mountain will just move
[49:52] right out of the way must you see your
[49:55] little Mustard Seed Faith now brother
[49:56] Brown said this it'll grow into a marble
[49:59] and then it'll grow into a grapefruit
[50:01] and then it'll grow into Mountain sized
[50:04] faith and now we got to have faith he
[50:06] said you you ain't even hardly got faith
[50:08] to see a toothache healed but you got to
[50:11] have faith for a body change so we got
[50:14] to have a great big amount of faith we
[50:16] got to have faith to overcome all these
[50:18] obstacles I I want to encourage you if
[50:20] you maybe you're struggling with faith
[50:22] to see a toothache healed that that
[50:24] there's let me encourage you that
[50:25] there's a promise in the word that all
[50:28] things are impossible it doesn't matter
[50:30] if it's kidney stones it doesn't matter
[50:32] if it's a toothache let's get all these
[50:35] let's get all this reasoning out of our
[50:36] mind see as soon as you start going to
[50:38] preaching along these lines people start
[50:40] the reasoning you start talking about
[50:42] what Paul Paul wasn't healed for this
[50:43] and I remember what brother Brian wanted
[50:45] to heal to the squirrel and all this
[50:46] kind of stuff let's cast down reasonings
[50:48] and just look to what God's word says it
[50:51] doesn't matter if you've been sitting on
[50:53] your sickness for years and years and
[50:55] the devil's got it in your mind that you
[50:57] just got to deal with it you just got to
[50:58] sit on that you just gotta you just
[51:01] that's just the way it is but yet
[51:02] there's a promise in God's word laying
[51:05] there that we've got to come to we've
[51:08] got to come to the place where we can
[51:09] believe that we can believe like brother
[51:11] Branham did the little fish he did fell
[51:13] over there and he spoke about their life
[51:14] that Hattie rice children were laying
[51:16] over there laughing in the corner and
[51:18] the word the faith came into the room
[51:21] and Faith had an effect to bring those
[51:23] children back to her
[51:26] that's our problem reasoning goes to
[51:29] work that's what the statue of perfect
[51:30] man is to cast down reasoning the word
[51:33] will get rid of all of our reasoning
[51:35] until our spirit completely lines up
[51:37] with the soul the faith that's down on
[51:40] the inside of our heart
[51:42] that's why if you really see what faith
[51:45] is like like that quote brother Ryan was
[51:47] was saying if you really see what faith
[51:49] is it's an impartation of eternal life
[51:51] from you from God himself to you that
[51:54] starts your journey at the bottom of the
[51:55] pyramid faith faith the faith that I
[51:58] have
[51:59] the the life that I now live I live by
[52:02] the faith of the Son of God faith is
[52:04] what God has given you as part of the
[52:06] new birth it's his faith it's his life
[52:09] in you his life in you to believe the
[52:12] word until they claim to the word that's
[52:14] why you've got to be born again because
[52:16] without being born again you can't have
[52:18] that kind of Faith you might have a
[52:20] little bit of faith for the time like
[52:21] the Believers in the Old Testament Faith
[52:23] to just kind of get get a quick Glimpse
[52:25] at what God wanted them to do but faith
[52:28] that comes with a new birth is God
[52:30] himself in you believing his word to see
[52:33] his word come to pass in you
[52:36] oh that's why it'll produce a miracle in
[52:38] your life that's why it'll change you
[52:40] that's why it'll change your nature or
[52:42] to change your thinking as as we'll get
[52:43] to this afternoon when I'm I'm gonna
[52:45] talk about Oneness brother Adam said
[52:47] that when Eve listen to The Devil's lie
[52:49] it changed your thinking what will the
[52:51] word of God do to you it will change
[52:53] your thinking it will change the way
[52:55] that you act so that you love your
[52:57] brother and love your sister and it'll
[52:59] change you because what is it faith is
[53:01] having a an effect
[53:03] and be not afraid to desire Brotherhood
[53:06] said why did he say that
[53:08] about must receive Faith you cannot
[53:10] hybrid mustard it won't cross with
[53:13] nothing you can hybrid kale get rapes
[53:16] blood and so forth but you can't hybrid
[53:18] mustard it won't cross no sir it's
[53:21] genuine mustard and if you got great big
[53:24] Faith a miracle will happen
[53:27] but if you got just a little bit of
[53:28] faith and this genuine Mustard Seed
[53:31] watch it bring you right on through
[53:33] every case
[53:35] bring you right out why cause must
[53:38] receive Faith still believes that God is
[53:41] still God Amen oh Mustard Seed Faith
[53:44] will lay Hank claim to it must receive
[53:46] Faith oh think about what muster see
[53:48] faith is it's not going to mix it's not
[53:50] going to mix with a reason it's somebody
[53:52] says well I don't know if I think you
[53:53] just lost your heel and I don't think
[53:55] you really got what you you did but
[53:56] Mustard Seed Faith will just it'll hang
[53:58] on because it's not going to mix it's
[54:00] not going to mix with the devil's lie it
[54:03] just hangs on Mustard Seed Faith what
[54:05] does it do it believes that God is still
[54:08] a rewarder it believes that God will
[54:10] reward you oh you say you come you come
[54:13] to God in the middle of the night beside
[54:15] your bed with that kind of faith and you
[54:17] might think well my children are past
[54:19] saving well it just don't matter anymore
[54:22] I've tried and I've tried I've tried and
[54:24] I've tried to be healed and I've went to
[54:26] all these doctors but you come claiming
[54:28] claiming your inheritance with Mustard
[54:30] Seed Faith
[54:32] Mustard Seed Faith can wait patiently
[54:35] and confidently like Abraham for 25
[54:38] years
[54:39] that's why the Bible says they that wait
[54:41] upon the Lord shall renew their strength
[54:44] as long as you wait the more you wait
[54:46] the more your faith builds up the more
[54:48] your strength and the longer it takes
[54:50] the more you believe not the less you
[54:52] believe that but the more you believe
[54:55] and God has given us this morning
[54:58] a recipe for faith
[55:00] and it's laying there in Romans chapter
[55:02] 10.
[55:03] I know this morning this morning is the
[55:05] short lesson so I don't have much longer
[55:08] Romans chapter 10 verse 14 says how then
[55:11] shall they call on him in whom they have
[55:13] not believed and how shall they believe
[55:16] in him of whom they have not heard and
[55:19] how shall they hear without a preacher
[55:21] how do you even know what to do without
[55:23] a preacher how do you even know what to
[55:25] do without hearing hearing somebody tell
[55:27] you that God made a promise
[55:28] and how shall they preach except they be
[55:31] sent as it is written how beautiful are
[55:33] the feet of them that preach the gospel
[55:34] of peach peace and bring Glad Tidings of
[55:38] good things are the feet of them
[55:39] beautiful that bring glad tidies some
[55:42] sometimes you know it feels like they're
[55:44] not sometimes you know like brother
[55:46] Brown said he got pulled over by that
[55:47] cop one time and he pulled out his wall
[55:48] and it said he was a minister and that
[55:50] guy got to got to mocking him and God I
[55:52] think this is an age where you should we
[55:54] should be given more respect to the
[55:55] ministers why because they're bringing
[55:57] something to you to help you to get you
[55:59] out of to preach a message of Liberty to
[56:01] get you out of the condition that you're
[56:03] in this this is Aid where we shouldn't
[56:05] be putting down ministers and and making
[56:07] fun of them and putting them under our
[56:09] feet and trying to trying to say we know
[56:11] more about them more about it than them
[56:12] and and the Bible says that the feet of
[56:15] the of a Preacher is supposed to be
[56:16] beautiful the beautiful because it's
[56:18] bringing you something that will help
[56:19] you and so then Paul's goes on to say in
[56:22] verse 17 so then Faith cometh by hearing
[56:25] and hearing by the word of God
[56:28] so if we want more faith it comes by
[56:30] preaching if we want more faith it comes
[56:33] by the word if we want more faith it
[56:35] comes by repetition just hearing it over
[56:38] and over again now I don't know about
[56:39] y'all but but I like I like hearing
[56:42] things over and over sometimes it seems
[56:43] like you know we want to hear the great
[56:44] the next big thing something that'll
[56:46] just knock our socks off but I like
[56:48] hearing somebody just tell me about
[56:49] being born again I like somebody telling
[56:51] me about the stash you're a perfect man
[56:52] why because hearing those things over
[56:54] and over again it builds up my faith it
[56:56] causes me to know praise God somebody
[56:58] else is getting it somebody else is
[57:00] understanding I like to hear I hear kind
[57:03] of things rehashed a little bit why
[57:04] because hearing is connected with your
[57:07] faith maybe somebody will rehash
[57:09] something that I preached a long time
[57:10] ago or brother Wade or something but you
[57:12] you preach it again you say it again say
[57:14] it again in the parking lot many times
[57:16] I've heard somebody say it again in the
[57:18] parking lot and it'll be something that
[57:19] I never thought of and I thought oh God
[57:22] thank you for that why because hearing
[57:24] is what is connected with your faith as
[57:26] you receive it in your ears as you
[57:28] receive it through your through your
[57:30] reading sitting there you're just
[57:31] receiving it in and it's building up
[57:33] something that you can something that
[57:35] you can base your faith on brother Brown
[57:37] said what a beautiful thing tonight for
[57:39] Divine Healing The Promise is given to
[57:41] you by his stripes you were healed
[57:44] what do you think about that
[57:46] by his stripes you were healed it's
[57:48] yours by promise
[57:50] now we have to go in and take it maybe
[57:52] you can't take it all at one time maybe
[57:54] you can just accept it tonight like I
[57:57] said this morning if you wanted an oak
[57:58] tree in your front yard and somebody
[58:00] give you an acorn you've already got the
[58:01] oak tree you've got it in seed form the
[58:04] only thing you have to do is plant that
[58:06] seed it'll produce the tree so as soon
[58:09] as you get the seed you've got the tree
[58:12] that's right and seed for now what was
[58:15] he saying now as soon there's the seed
[58:18] by his stripes you were here
[58:20] by his stripes you were healed and
[58:22] that's preached over the pulpit and you
[58:23] hear that preach by his stripes I'm
[58:25] Healed and you and it falls down in the
[58:27] good ground of your heart and you just
[58:29] you just sit there and meditate on that
[58:30] God you said by your stripes I'm Healed
[58:33] and you start thinking about how all
[58:34] that ties together he died on that cross
[58:36] for me he stretched his arms wide for me
[58:38] all the all the scripture types ties
[58:41] together and he's the one that made the
[58:42] made the sacrifice and you begin to
[58:44] meditate on that that's the seed it's a
[58:47] seed that's planted in your heart and
[58:48] you keep hanging on to that and it's
[58:50] going to come up oh I thank God that
[58:53] we've got a promise like that that you
[58:54] hear every promise of God if you'll just
[58:57] hold it in your heart it's going to come
[58:58] up and he said just as soon faith comes
[59:01] by hearing hearing of the word and when
[59:04] you hear that Jesus Christ is the Healer
[59:06] he's raised from the dead reproducing
[59:09] his life has healed the sick you've
[59:12] already got your healing in seed form oh
[59:16] to think about that now that is the word
[59:18] is being preached you've already got it
[59:19] you hold it down in your heart you've
[59:21] already got it now now you just got to
[59:22] hang on to it hold it hold don't let it
[59:25] go hold on to it until it comes up man
[59:29] it will manifest now there's there's you
[59:31] the recipe recipe for receiving every
[59:33] promise of God that's from the new birth
[59:35] to Healing to Salvation to your children
[59:37] to paying the bills every promise of God
[59:41] you the word is received down in your
[59:43] heart and you just hang on to it you've
[59:46] got the thing you got it just hang on
[59:48] and it'll come up now now
[59:52] bear with me just a little bit just walk
[59:54] through walk through the process of
[59:55] being born again the word you hear the
[59:57] word and you it tells you you need to be
[59:59] justified and you turn around and you
[1:00:01] start walking a little bit Direction
[1:00:02] what the word is having an effect on
[1:00:04] your life the word is is falling down in
[1:00:06] your heart and you're hanging on to it
[1:00:07] it's causing an effect in your life the
[1:00:10] word you keep you keep laying there
[1:00:12] under the subjection of the word and the
[1:00:14] word gets rid of that the word that
[1:00:16] you're holding down in your heart gets
[1:00:18] rid of that unclean spirit and you begin
[1:00:21] to come to church you begin to want the
[1:00:22] things of God and you begin to act
[1:00:24] different hang around hang around
[1:00:25] Believers if you want different things
[1:00:27] and you're you're the the life the life
[1:00:29] starts to change because the unclean
[1:00:31] spirit's going out but then that word
[1:00:33] that you've been packing down in there
[1:00:35] that word that you hell that promise
[1:00:37] that promise of the new birth now you've
[1:00:39] hold held on to it and the baptism of
[1:00:42] the Holy Ghost can come on that word and
[1:00:44] Quicken it now that the unclean spirit's
[1:00:47] gone out now that you've turned around
[1:00:48] your trajectory has been changed and
[1:00:50] it'll bring it up bring it and manifest
[1:00:52] it in your life
[1:00:54] see if you've got the seed you've got
[1:00:57] the thing but you just got to hang on to
[1:01:00] the promise and watch it produce
[1:01:02] brother Adam said let me plant the word
[1:01:04] of God in my heart and purpose there
[1:01:06] that I will not turn to the right hand
[1:01:08] or to the left hand away from it but
[1:01:10] I'll live true to it all the days of my
[1:01:12] life oh we sometimes we think the word
[1:01:15] the gospel is so complicated but it's
[1:01:17] just as simple as it's so simple you can
[1:01:19] preach it to some uneducated people in
[1:01:21] the jungles of Africa it's just like
[1:01:23] just like planting a seed in the field
[1:01:24] you plant you plant the word in the
[1:01:26] heart of a Believer you find some good
[1:01:28] ground and plant that seed in there and
[1:01:30] it's going to come up Let the Holy
[1:01:32] Spirit move into our hearts brother
[1:01:33] Brandon said and plant the word let us
[1:01:36] be the feel that the word will fall in
[1:01:37] that will bring forth fruits in the
[1:01:39] coming year Grant it Lord another place
[1:01:41] brother Raymond said I believe that God
[1:01:43] has to do the saving I believe God has
[1:01:46] to plant the word I the Lord says the
[1:01:48] Bible Isaiah I the Lord hath planted it
[1:01:51] all water it day and night unless some
[1:01:53] should pluck it from my hand oh to think
[1:01:56] this morning that God is looking for
[1:01:57] somebody that'll hang on to his word
[1:01:59] like that God is looking for Faith and
[1:02:01] how do you get Faith by the word he's
[1:02:03] looking for somebody that will take what
[1:02:05] he said and just believe it say that's
[1:02:07] nothing but the truth like had it right
[1:02:10] Patty Wright got her children to fall
[1:02:12] over her knees because she just said
[1:02:14] that's nothing but the truth the word
[1:02:17] was born and married because she just
[1:02:18] grabbed hold to the word and said be it
[1:02:20] unto me according to Thy word the angel
[1:02:22] spoke a promise over her life and she
[1:02:24] said be it unto me according to Thy word
[1:02:26] and now that's that's real Mustard Seed
[1:02:28] Faith that ain't mixed with no reason of
[1:02:30] the world there was plenty of things
[1:02:32] that Mary could have reasoned about she
[1:02:33] could have said well I'm not married
[1:02:35] that would have been a big one I'm not
[1:02:37] married I've never known a man all these
[1:02:39] things laying there that she could have
[1:02:40] reasoned about but instead of that she
[1:02:42] cast down reasoning and said be it unto
[1:02:45] me according to Thy word
[1:02:47] God is looking for for somebody that he
[1:02:50] can get a hold of he's looking for that
[1:02:52] good ground that he can plant that word
[1:02:54] in he wants to think that he wants to
[1:02:56] plant the word and the ground of your
[1:02:58] heart yes he wants to see you bear fruit
[1:03:01] he wants to see his promises fulfilled
[1:03:03] in you
[1:03:05] and I believe this morning and that's
[1:03:07] every one of our confession this morning
[1:03:09] that I want to see God's word fulfilled
[1:03:11] in my life I want to see his promises I
[1:03:13] want to see you know you know look at
[1:03:15] the Statue of a perfect man there's a
[1:03:16] promise in here that you can have the
[1:03:17] same kind of temperance that God had
[1:03:19] that Jesus had the same kind of patience
[1:03:22] that Jesus had and that that this the
[1:03:25] recipe is laying here in his Bible to
[1:03:28] get that same kind of a life you just
[1:03:31] got to lay under the word and let it
[1:03:32] have an influence on you you just keep
[1:03:34] taking in those seeds those little seeds
[1:03:36] as they're planted the little the little
[1:03:38] bits of word as they're planted and grab
[1:03:40] a hold to it and believe it and it will
[1:03:42] start to have an effect in your life in
[1:03:44] Matthew Chapter 13 it says that he that
[1:03:47] Jesus was telling that parable of the
[1:03:49] sower he that soweth the good seed is
[1:03:51] the son of man and he said in Luke
[1:03:53] chapter 8 now the parable is this the
[1:03:55] seed is the word of God and brother
[1:03:57] Brown will say every spoken word of God
[1:03:59] is the Original Seed God planted
[1:04:02] everything in the Earth by his word and
[1:04:04] as long as you stay with the Original
[1:04:06] Seed
[1:04:07] it will breed itself right back and
[1:04:10] reproduce itself again let's let the
[1:04:13] musicians go ahead and come forward and
[1:04:14] we'll stop like there now sometimes like
[1:04:17] you're watching a wheat plant grow up
[1:04:18] from the little seed it takes time it
[1:04:21] takes patience for seed to come up it's
[1:04:23] Taken 2 000 years for the bride to come
[1:04:25] to a place of maturity that that the
[1:04:28] original word the original Faith to be
[1:04:30] restored back sometimes it takes time
[1:04:32] patience but that don't matter sometimes
[1:04:35] it takes time to see something happen in
[1:04:37] your life and your family's life and
[1:04:38] your children's life but that doesn't
[1:04:39] that doesn't matter you just keep
[1:04:41] holding on to God's word and you'll see
[1:04:43] it you'll see something happen you love

[1:05:04] all I want to see I want him to see my
[1:05:06] face I want him to know that I believe
[1:05:08] his word I want him to see that I accept
