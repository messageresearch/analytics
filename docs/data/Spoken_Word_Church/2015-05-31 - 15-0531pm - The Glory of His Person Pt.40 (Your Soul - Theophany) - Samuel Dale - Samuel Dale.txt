Gospel business and Men meeting in Gainesville and what came across my mind was brother dick was out of town in 2006 and I got a pair of leading song music one afternoon if you remember and something struck me just like a spear hit me in the back and that's that period of time I went through with osteomyelitis and was very very sick and so I gave a testimony and you know if you don't never take or never pass up the opportunity to share what the Lord's done especially a testimony there's a time or pray for somebody don't ever pass up the time to stop and pray for somebody if it's burdens on your heart I've I've failed to do that one time and it worried me it worried me till I came across that person again but just a little testimony that about this time of year no brother dick was out of out and I just praise God for his healing atonement amen that testimony in itself was just a god-working but it was pain his weakness leaving the body so that's all about our healing amen B Flair I I'm weak but Thou Art strong Jesus keep me from our own oh be satisfied as long as I walk let me walk close to thee the judge just a closer walk Within the Great granted Jesus is my place daily walking

power and love as we sing hold me holy holy loving thank you holy holy holy holy holy truly the Holy Holy I want to see you amen and amen and amen just keep on looking you'll see I mean good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like turning your scriptures turn where we read this morning we read from Revelations 1 and then we read from Philippians 2 we'll try to continue our thought on to you know this message uh to a lot of people thought that I was talking about the wrong Anna this morning is our daughter Anna that's having the operation Thursday so remember to pray for her I'm sure sister Anna marunga would tell you to pray for her too but not about an operation so just remember that it's Anna Roberts and they will be cake and ice cream after the service today so make sure you do and we're glad to have one more we're getting more people on the platform playing uh musical instruments than we used to have in the church all together so little Esther black is now playing the mandolin with us so we appreciate that Gloria give you a gift you use the gift you know and put it to work it'll work all right I think we've got all of the announcements but remember now the uh bible study this coming Saturday six o'clock come and be with us and then remember the Father's Day fishing for the brothers and for the sisters on the Friday night of that week they will be having their time here to church too kind of a little art and class and things and doing and eating together and fellowshipping I like to see people get together because you know you you've always said and a lot of people do you know well we just don't have no Fellowship you know nobody won't get the world if you'll get together we have something for you to do sometime to where you can Fellowship together because that's what we want to do you know and to make it that way so you don't have an excuse to say well well we just don't what you mean is you want everybody to get in your ship in your front yard you know probably your own home but uh you know sometimes you have to get out and go and everything else in other people's ship to do a little bit all right so just remember that okay the heavenly father we thank you that today and the hour has come upon mankind that we can truly talk about is Paul and Peter Nim would say that the end of all things has come upon us we know that we are not making dates and setting times we're not concerned about that we're concerned about getting ready against the day that we're living and that would be more important than to know anything about the day or the hour who's going to be president what's going to be that's not for us to worry about you said you put in Kings and you take out Kings who you take care of all that business we just sit back and and watch it all transpire we ask you to be with us and bless now remember the sick one remember Brother Gary touching mother and just delivering from that because we believe in a total deliverance we thank you for all of the medical signs you have given us and things that we can do Lord and help our Earthly bodies and things as we hurt and things we thank you but we know who the healer is we know who the deliverer is we thank you for that have your way now forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and keep us in Jesus name you mean all right Revelations 112 and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the pouch with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like undefined Bryce as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters all right remember now that's what we're talking about his the glory of his person all right so now we go to Philippians 2 and verse 5. let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient to death even the death of the Cross you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now they're not to try to back up much but to you know tie the thought together and continue on because surely by now after all of these years you were to at least know one thing for certain you know that brother Dale believes in a real God and you know a lot of people have have went through it and I'm not throwing off now but you know back when they what was that guy's name altizer was that his name anyhow the guy that said God was dead uh you know when that went out and he published stats you know saying God is dead you know everybody oh every denomination ever thing you know oh no God's Not Dead we talked to him this morning we prayed to him and all that was well and good that's that's fine that's not a a problem in in the sincerity though of it is what kind of a god did they believe in you know did they have anything to take show of that God right then you move up into ranks and you get into places if you got churches that believe in signs and wonders and and you have those things in order to take place and uh but the point is what about the word if the new birth is the birth of the word and I believe that the way that I've always tried to teach it to you all right then God must be the word and not just letters on a page but it must be the very god of the word the the word the letters the spirit the all and all and Jesus is his name all right then in that we're watching him condescend down to uh you know to life and doings and and asking you uh what kind of a god do you have I'm honest I've always tried to be with you as sincere as I can uh why serve a God that you don't believe that he can take care of your problem I mean what's the purpose is it just a totem pole but you know to most people God is no more than a totem foe totem pole uh religion form because it's just what they've been taught all their life and they just go to church and they do and they they're wonderful and all that's wonderful and great but what about the one true and living God what do we have to understand all about God to be able to to have salvation but may I turn it around how can you have salvation without knowing about God you know a doctor friend of mine he I was talking to him one day there and he he was saying that some people you know were kind of making light of him that they were you know more in the atheist form and doctors and things and said one of them said to him said I don't see how you can believe in a real God knowing as much as you do about medical science he said I don't see how you can know as much as you know about medical science and not believe in a God you know well see that's that's the truth that's the point but this my point is to make sure that we serve a true God and not just the thoughts of our mind or or what mama taught us or what you know but to believe in God as being real and that whatever real he is remember he always has been because he doesn't change is that the scripture I'm God and I change not right he doesn't he doesn't change with time we change but he doesn't change he's always been the same now he may not reveal himself in the ages of down through time as being uh all you know at one way because that's the unfolding but remember once it's unfolded all of the pieces have got to be put together to make the puzzle so how can you uh not accept what Luther taught or the just shall live by faith how is it we would not you know that we could would not accept what Wesley taught of sanctification or what do many others you know the that come down through there in Azusa Street Pentecost where would we reject something like that and try to believe in God we can't do it it's got to stay and remain the same all right now but remember Hebrews 13 8 said he's the same yesterday today and forever the prophet would say it this away he said whatever he is he always was because he doesn't change all right so why can't we believe that as being the reality of him being real instead of just thinking well you know God is a spirit and we're you know we just don't really know about God uh the theologians can't explain it well I I haven't never asked any of them to explain it to me because I I the one that I depend upon is the holy spirit that is within me because he's the only one that's the only one that can explain it to me even brother Branham in greatest he was to make it as simple as he did it still didn't reveal God to the world it's not going to do that you know it might might be enough to condemn them yeah but not enough to save them because that's the point all right so then I believe in a real God I believe in real salvation I believe in the reality of Life of doings and you know and knowing that God is real and uh you know everything's okay uh maybe we can get this thing straightened out somewhere I'll pin it up nothing else maybe that'll do it okay may not look too good but it stopped the bloom Plum I don't know if I can hear it I know you can all right but listen the point is you know we we remark about people saying God is dead but see I don't think the demand back there even was saying God died right you know because it'd be stupid to think it's of a God and then God died I mean that would be stupidity in the highest form if you're going to believe in a God and then believe that God died well that would make him something like we are but to believe that he died in the lives of the people then I would agree I would agree to that that the biggest portion of people of the world today that their God is a is in the form of a totem pole it may be called Jesus brother Reynolds said you can call him Jesus Jesus and worship the devil now that's that's pretty strong right yeah all right but now we got down to trying to bring it forth as we've been teaching it for months and months and months bringing it down to to the truth of the one true and living God and seeing that we tied it in this morning as to Bringing Down that I hope you caught that point that whatever he was he was back there then he literally uh in his descending he he was lowering himself instead of being over here and getting greater going that way he was really bringing himself downward to where that we could start from Genesis 1 and then go back upward in our understanding our Revelation you know to where we could see God in the way that we're supposed to see him well then he was just as real before the world as he is now because we're the ones that's dethroned him I I like a message that brought a random priest back there he said uh you know dethroning God you know an exactly title but it's dethroning what about the one where he preached like raising God from history now what does he mean by that well he was that big here and they they lost him enough that's no that's not my understanding when you're talking about raising God from history you're you're trying to bring him to the position that he always wanted to be not trying to raise him up is something else all right and seeing that one true and living God I'm seeing how real he is and how that he's manifest himself and all of the titles are the things that the Bible would call him you know that theologians would come up with words and that's where brother random picked it up from because see like logos means speech or or thought presented by speech or words all right see then uh he would be talking about uh theophany and see we've got our minds still hooked on oh it's way up that way when that's not what the scripture even says he said if this perfectly Tabernacle word dissolved we have one all right before the world God knew everybody that it would ever be saved right and he wrote our names in The Book of Life or left them out right well what's the problem you got to have something up yonder you know or is it in his mind the I'm trying to get us to see God here a god up in heaven doesn't help us very much all right you ain't careful you just got a totem pole you're trying to beg him to come down huh I'm trying to get him to where that he'll come into reality because that we can call him on the scene all right now see then those words that we use are words like Elohim that's a word in the the the scholars would know those words but see then when you break it down as meaning self-existing now it's coming down to understanding for you and I right it's bringing God forth into our words you know I I love to listen to The Prophet's message because that's what caught my attention was how that a man could take the the the things and even use the big words that the theologians would use you know and uh but he could make that simple enough that I could understand it you know and you know to do that he had to put a lot of it in his own words brother random will say something and he'll said see that the Bible says that and there's literally not a trend not a word verbatim of what he said but it's his thought from the word well I'll take that won't you I'll just stay with that part and believe it all right now so then we got down to thinking and talking about why can't we just see that if if a theophany is a word body not just a body produced by the word but a word body why can't we believe that as being something real why not make it that simple why not simplify in the basis of logos theophany speech you know simplify it and just simply say God is real what's what's the problem see the other way you think in your mind is so great is you've got all these words you make it sound so beautiful but it's like I've always tried to explain to you I know how to wire a house I know how to cook hook up the whole house and wire it I can do every bit of it I can do three ways I can do basically any type of house wiring well I'd be an idiot to want to talk to Einstein but all it is is just a little higher electrical outlets and fixes and you remember the first computer covered a city block you know the reason it did it had so many on and off switches that it took that much territory for it to cover all right but see the point I'm trying to get you is is why can't we make it simple enough to see our own sails and to see what's taking place and then that way it's not making it something great he's already great we don't have to make him anything we just try to believe him all right and tying together all we did this morning and bringing it out to the bases and seeing what and all of those terminologies logos theophthany's word word body anything you want to bring in Son of God um great words that we come to can be simply summed up in one thing God is real and that not not that God has a soul because then you'll run into your nature situation but to say that God is a soul because what is a soul so being it's a person it's what you are right but but brother down all I see is outside well if we have time to get through the things when brother Branham went beyond the curtain of time you know what he he didn't see as I said this morning not making light of nothing he's telling the truth he didn't see little inch square compartments he didn't see little floating Spirits floating around he even in his early Ministry before he had went there he believed that he would be able to see those people but he would not be able to touch him you remember that he said I'd see brother Neville and see him well he didn't say I just see his foot floating by and say Hey Brother Neville you know no no he explained it that it would have hand and it would he would see it he'd know his brother Neville but that he couldn't touch it but when he went beyond the curtain of time he found it was a whole lot more real than that all right and watch as we get on down to it then what did he see when Jesus descended to preach to the spirits that were in prison brother Randall said he saw them and we'll read it in a minute where he's talking about both The Sinner and the saint he saw them in the same form of a body that that's what Jesus went and preached to the same form of the body of the people that he saw beyond the curtain of time I mean do we decrease did something happen and all at once but see the the main thing is people can't get it together to see how that within us is a soul that that's what we are right this out here I can deceive you with it I can deceive you with this outward parts but inside of there may I quote wrote around him have you ever noticed him explaining the lie detector test to where you can't lie you know because something now be real careful don't answer me is the lie detector detesting your spirit or your soul okay you're going to jump to the spirit right but you better jump off in a hurry because the spirit can be activated and done and you know what I can do they can hook up that because I remember seeing it in a movie one time and I thought well that's a good point I'll remember that he was asking a man a question and he had a pen sticking in his leg every time that question was asked he's picked that pen well that pen showed it made that movement and they thought he was telling the truth when he was lying like everything to him all right see that Spirit can be fooled with with that inner part of you can't lie come on even if it's Fallen estate it's in the image of God so get away from it get to thinking that's what I want you to do I want you to think things over see that that being that we are the soul is a whole lot more real than this body you're looking at right because this body you're looking at it will go back to the dust rotting and Decay totally annihilated other than a spoon of dust but that Soul lives on brother Branham didn't see little Spooks beyond the curtain of time he described the people that even the men had a maybe a little long hair you remember them you know he described them to the detail see that was where did I used to be and I told you I preached it but when I seen the truth about it I could come back here and told you I used to think that the theosity would be no way that it could have any feelings whatsoever because I knew the quotes from The Prophet about the things that a theophany don't eat et cetera and things like that but then one day when I noticed he said they went beyond the curtain of time and they had their senses he said when Jesus went and preached to the spirits in prison he said he had all his senses well see we want to put senses to body connected through spirit I'm still trying my best to explain how real God he is you may think that I'm over on the other part but I'm trying my best to explain how real he is and what is all right go see he's more real than anything we think about because he created us that would be enough right there tonight but yeah we do the best we can to try to explain things well why can't we call Logos theophany on us why can't we call it this simple terminology so I'm going to say this old because your body spirit and soul brother Ryan said without any of without one of those you're not complete that's what's the difference between the animal and the human right we'll see what we think the difference between an animal and a human is you've got animal life you know flesh whatever Birds what and then you've got a spirit motivating and then we just want to make a a soul as being something sprinkled over that spirit or some nature of that spirit so I told you I quoted that to that man that time where brought around and said the nature of your soul is God if you're born again if not it's of the world he said how can a nature have a nature I don't know one of you argue with him you're not in downtown Fool with It but you see we get in our mind and we think and you'd be surprised how much we still hold on to those things I'm trying my best to get you and I to realize a soul a being is what you are run around them what is a soul he says this to you that's inside well is there something inside of me but what do you think when brother Brandon went beyond the curtain of time remember he was young you remember the people were here but remember you can look back on the bed and see his body and it was still wiggling but remember also there wasn't no babies in heaven beyond the curtain of time there were no babies but when he saw which one was it um Sharon Rose when he saw her not in the situation beyond the curtain of time on that I know the difference okay but he did see her in the last time he seen her was just a few months old one time he said six months one time he says eight months one time he says 18 months or something you know he's just human but he said she was a beautiful young girl and you know what she didn't go into all the opening of the seals and all of the great things because she was a child but she told him what was going to take place I'm waiting here on Billy Paul's and he'll be alone but see how real do we think reality really is let me ask you this question do you think that your theophany be in your soul is going to be four foot tall and you're six foot right right I mean here's my theophany is going to look like brother collie to see me beyond the curtain of time and what the prophet would call my soul my theophany my being and talk about his own would I look like brother Colleen he'd look like me no not exactly now I don't think me and brother Carly either one is going to be a little over 200 pounds I said a little over again I don't think so I like the way the prophet described it he said somewhere around you know 18 20. 25 or something years old and and I like that because that signifies the prime but I've seen some people at 18 years old that I know what I mean but they've been a whole lot prettier at 25. you ever noticed that never run talk about his first girlfriend not to tickle and Evil I would leg like a swan arms I describe my wife like that and I'd get breakfast wrote at me well yet he was just a human but he was always trying to describe what he saw right trying to tell us what he himself had experienced and he saw that and he'd come back and tell us we may not have the experience of going over there and coming back you know because it's maybe not made for us and uh I I'm human I believe some people tell about having great ex out of body experiences and and that's that's all I believe in it I'm not wrong I believe in it but I listen to the way they describe what they saw and as they described it I had this out of body experience and I went there and I saw all these men with higher way down on their legs on their waist and time I thought uh that that don't fit it just and then especially after a while they begin to start preaching it like that you know it's okay for men to have long hair because I saw them there were longer I'm going to argue what you saw I'm just going to say you misinterpreted what you saw that'll come out a little bit different all right listen folks try to get you to think how real is actually real how real are you the only way I can know that is by the soul that's within you and you can deceive me with the body you can deceive me by the spirit but you will not deceive me from that soul you know why because if that Soul doesn't follow the word I don't care what you say if it doesn't line up with the word and I've got a quote in here so you'd know that I wouldn't make too much without but what about you no Brother Ray we kid him about being little but he keeps us about being tall so you know what's the disadvantages or advantages what's the problem I mean you know I don't get offended at saying hey you know you're you're tall no problem it doesn't hurt my feelings for somebody to say something like that to me why because I'm just me all right but if we rile up you know and start getting upset about what somebody has said let's just jokingly with us then we need to think that thing over a little bit we've got kind of a a complex on that you know and we shouldn't have that it don't matter where it's big little or whatever you know we should just be ourselves you know I used to kid old brother Fred Hooper most of you know him and uh we'd rag him and he but he just ragged you back and that's the way I liked it me and him always got along good in fellowshipping you know because then you know and he he'd do something about what he's doing because he always brother colleague in a minute he always had the biggest hammer was up here working on the church and you know instead of a little claw hammer you know a regular top Carpenter's hand handled I mean you know the lint he had one about that long and buds you better not try to draw nails with him either because he he could do it but he also liked a big old gun and he had one that hung down and walked through the woods he'd have to get over the logs rely out on them can win all life about Sin but you know what he made his point don't fool with the old boy he'd work you to death what am I talking about you and what you are I don't need of us trying to be anything other than what we are just be ourselves I don't try to put on any show somewhere I'm just myself I've worked with these brothers they got a right to get up and tell you that I worked with them for years I didn't live no different darn than I do here don't let no dealer here and I did dire because that was just me because that's what me that's my being and I believe God has given me an understanding to to try to express what a real person is all right and but the reason I tried to express it is to see how real he is right now when Abraham saw or excuse me Moses but but Abraham coming over melcha when Moses saw the back part of a man that brought a random call to the theophany all right then what would that be a word body we read this morning all right then when he saw that who did that back part look like I believe it looked like Jesus Christ I believe it looked like him when he come in flesh because why would you make it any different I believe the one that came to melt to Abraham that we talked about in the mail Saturday I believe he looked like Jesus Christ because why would you want it something else see if your your soul steps out of your body it's got to go somewhere right sinner or saint borned again or not born again the second you die that Soul leaves that body and it goes somewhere all right what does it look like watch it in a minute when brother Brennan was talking about how that Jesus went down and preached to those that couldn't repent he preached to those that could repent he's not talking about two different degrees of a hail or whatever you want to talk about he's talking about what those who were unrepentant as in the days of the no way don't Rafael and those who could come out of paradise with him why not he had to testify to all of them because of being a witness all right follow that keep that thought and then you begin to see that when it said when brother Randall said like this morning a theophany it's a word body it's a body it's not just a spirit floating around it's a body and what would that body look like you beyond the curtain of time they look so much like the brother random knew his wife come on we'll see the word theophany you don't have that word in your Bible to run our strong concordance or anything off of so Webster gives the definition of a theophany as being a manifestation or appearance of God or like an appearance of God to man you know bringing him down to understand Look up the word soul and it'll be the real you run around and say it's you that's on the inside of you but I know see but I just can't see well what is it what size is it what what's wrong with being the size you are I've done Express now I don't think me and brother coli is going to be a little over 200 pound in a theophany that's why I don't think we understand a new birth because when we talk about the person of Jesus Christ coming in you we think this well when I got to New Birth I had to move over a little because God come in and stood over here and I'm standing over here why can't you think about did he just gave you eternal life why can't you think about that or just giving you eternal life then that would be his own life given to you all right but that's quote see the person of Jesus Christ coming and living in Iran this quote right the baptism of the Holy Ghost coming and living in you right but why can't you get the real point of seeing it you don't have to put another person inside of you you just clean up that old fella that's there and get everything out of the way and God gives that old fellow that was our eternal life makes your soul eternal all right but see was God ever real right around him they asked him said did Jesus did God have that body he said yeah he said he came here on Earth and he said he even went to hell in that soul because he said said his body went to the Grave his Spirit went back to God who gave it he said his soul went to hell well now when his soul what the hell was it look like come on that's all I'm trying to get you to think then you realize how real God is and you'll realize eternal life and what it is god uniting with you in your soul to make your soul eternal you see why I fought so hard all of these doctrines you know you came here with eternal life brother Al and them brother calling them was coming back out of the mountains one day you heard me tell about it and this brother in there he he he had that Doctrine and uh I just asked him a simple question I said where was that seed that you're talking about was it in your body your spirit or your soul I'm not gonna answer you well I got to feeling sorry for him because the brothers kind of took it up and began to do a lot of quoting and I believe he'd walked halfway out of the mountain if we'd have stopped but we took him home and he never did want to ride with us again but I got the feeling sorry for him because they were tearing him up with the word but yet he I'm not going to say well if you're not going to say then what do you believe well brother Dale I just can't explain what I believe you came you can't explain what you believe maybe you don't have very much of a believing now you don't have to explain everything in detail we're not but you're to be able to explain a little bit and then you shouldn't get offended if I'd say to you and say well brother Dale when I was born again I cried and I'd say well and I've run around and said a lot of people cried a lot of people didn't cry well are you saying that I didn't get it no you're saying it because the attitude you got you're getting all upset because your attitude but think what about words like brother Brown was saying God's first creation was himself when I don't want to do away with all of our thinking about the word creation we want to start realizing hey wait a minute the man is trying to explain God coming down to work that we can understand him and how some idea about his eternal supernatural being that has created all of these things and how real he really is he says that the logos the Son of God back there went out of God all right well did it did something to be here and it went out of it or was the way he's always described it as what the same God that's here moved over in another form that to me is simple he said yeah but now you've gone too much into Oneness I'll be glad to talk to you a little bit and let you see where there's wonders or not because you see you you're thinking about Oneness like the old Oneness idea I don't think like that about Oneness I think it takes Father Son and Holy Ghost to make one true and living God you can't separate it you are Oneness there had to be a time he could manifest himself as father as son as Holy Ghost and see he couldn't manifest himself as Holy Ghost when the time that he was manifesting himself to the son of God he was limited his own self to that partner you see a theophany what is a theophany we think about a theophany as in Corinthians where it says if we you know we die we have one waiting and we want to keep going up that way with it when as I said brother Branham would go beyond the curtain of time and he would call that a theophany and he called out a soul he called it a big a person it could be felt could be seen they could talk they could do all things and he's describing a person what's the problem with that what's the problem that that we would think about his soul was preaching to those people in hell his soul descended to hell for you and I I don't have to go right why because he's already been and paid the price well see the reality of him doing that run it over Brothers if you can pick up to about number nine let's just read a couple you know the way that I'm trying to bring it and look what he brings out about your soul this is taken from the interview when you say you're a Believer and do that it shows that there's something wrong you don't believe you're making out like you believe you're taking reasonings and not taking your Soul's conviction are you reading because your soul is the part of God that's in you watch that'll agree with God's word being true if not you're just take our intellectual about it does your soul being does it agree with the word well they keep on agreeing with the word I thought that we concluded by establishing the fact that that was the evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost or not was whether or not there's a spirit that was in us would agree with the word now how can all of these people all of these years that Acclaim even preached behind the prophet and then go out and say the prophet's wrong hmm now their souls not agreeing with the word sure they got a problem right right well now brother Dale you're thrown off or not not throwing off on nobody telling it like it is but see we want to try to make it some spiritual part instead of taking all of the things that we have the value of the message of the hour to be able to study these things in relationship to the word of God not from our own ideas but from the prophet of the day when he would say that on entombment his soul his Spirit his theophany of his own being you need that one that's number 11 film to pull it up his soul his the off his Spirit his theophany of his own being that's true may have gave you the wrong ones don't entombment that's number 11 but it's on entombment that's not the one I'm looking for but you can take it there it is he went and preached to the souls that were imprisoned that reprinted not in the long suffering of the days of Noah his soul his Spirit his theophany of his own being went down now he could put them all together right why can't we his soul is theophany his Spirit of his own being his soul was in Hell preaching alive let's see back up we're on I've got a number off here this reason it's not them it was me because I changed my notes all right back up to number eight let's get number seven and number eight unless establish a point so go with number seven well you and I brought around and says on the Oneness there's nothing got a soul like a man because that's what we are now our sacrifice today not only an ordinary human being but it was God himself that identified in flesh here upon the Earth when the blood cell broke not only did the soul of a man or a spirit of a man but God himself listen who was identified in that man returns back upon the Believers in The Believer in the baptism of the Holy Spirit the baptism of the Holy Spirit all right look at the next one number eight which is Israel and the church paragraph 94. and look what he said his soul returned back in the form of the baptism of the holy ghost that comes into ever believer well now his soul come into my soul now we need to stop right here and that's the way off I knew when I got to this point I'd either have to express it or bypass it to pick it up at a later date so let's talk about it a little what is the new birth it's the birth of the word where does it take place not in your body not in your spirit in your soul does God come down as you be in the soul and him come down and stand in there with you why do you have to have it done away why not think about as I said a moment ago did he come down and gave you eternal life he said he sent back the holy sent back his soul in the form the amorphied to worry that he could come down and give eternal life to our being or so not this body and spirit it don't work right it's that inner being part of you that's called a soul he doesn't have to come in to dwell and say persons together he just gives you eternal life that is the person of God right come on remember we're talking about a supernatural God we're not talking about some man that created a bunch of people and then comes down to living a bunch of people we're talking about the great Eternal God that could give today there's over seven billion people in the world today that he could give every person in the world the baptism of the Holy Ghost and not run out of God brother moat used to make the illustration the way we think it's like taking an apple cutting it up you give out pieces and you give out a while you're going to run out of pieces you ain't got no more Apple but you know what I believe that the more he divides himself among the people in the New Birth the greater he is instead of the Lesser he's multiplying himself into many sons and daughters of God by the new birth so he doesn't have to come and live in you as we say a person is the person of eternal life that gives you eternal life and then you and God are one together as persons a prophet would say why because you have the person of eternal life right I agree with you Ophelia back there is talking to me so you standing up looking and do you understand what I'm trying to get out like I tried my best to explain about the anointing that is able to come upon your spirit and really baptize your spirit without anointing the prophet would say but you know what that does not give you eternal life you can have the genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit upon your spirit every day of your life and still be lost right so it's a lot different from just words it's words to bring a revelation right you know what brother random said about a minister not only the gift that he had you remember this one the only gift a minister has is to break the spell that Satan has over your eyes to where God can speak to your heart right that's very close to mind convincing isn't it but that won't work because you mind convinced and you get him in with a hot dog you get him out with a hamburger somebody come along just a little better way of explaining things but can anybody take away from you what God has revealed to you because you know I believe in a personal God you know that that he's to every one of us a personal God think about it his soul his person of his being his theophany went to hell well then why would we have any trouble then when he gets over on the Hebrew Book and he says your soul is your theophany why would anybody want to argue then but but it might be often okay that's number I've got number 12 so check number 10. that's what I said I'm the one that's got them all check number 10 and see if that's what it is paragraph 279 Hebrews chapter 2. all right and when Man became into that body now I'll read it next but I was going to read Genesis 1 26 and 27. so now that's what he's talking about right and when Man became into that body he had control of the fish using the fowl remember that's in the spiritual body and there was no man to till the soil he done made male and female but there was no man to till the soil then God made man out of the earth dust of the earth he gave him their life like a chimpanzee and all your bodies made same kind of material but look what he said but the difference between an animal and a man God put a soul in a man he didn't put it in the animal because the soul that was in the man is that theophany all right now you follow that soul is that theophany Jesus when he went to hell the prophet we gave you his Spirit his soul his theophany of in being went to hell and brother Brown and went beyond the curtain of time the angel of the Lord referring to it said this is sold under the altar and then he'd call that a theophany the body that they were in so then we take the word theophany as just being some great big word that means eternal life what about a sinner where's he at today all born again believers come on go what behind the curtain of time right as your soul it's your theophany that's your being is that your body's in the grave your spirit went back to God who gave it all right and you're there waiting where's the sinner get the difference in the word theophany of one point the word theophany doesn't always refer to eternal life it refers to a body sinner don't have eternal life but he's in a body is he just a spirit flopping around somewhere no no he's in the body let's read that all right let's see if I can find it in my nose man we'll have to come back to that in a minute okay we're on Earth they offney being the body part okay now they won't have this and I'm sure but it's on the morning message number nine see I gave them two sets I don't even know how far we're going this evening it's off the message adoption and if they can pull that up never who's there can get it because he said Paul says hey they doing right because it does not already hear what kind of a body we'll have but we'll have a body like his what did he ever have that theophany body I'm a Jesus right he said yes sir when he died the Bible said he is a personal pronoun again he went to hell and preached to the souls that were in prison hallelujah how did he do it he had censored a feeling he had sensitive hearing he had sensitive speech he preached now once with that same kind of body I saw those glorified ones in the other night so it's easy to follow what kind of a body he was in but what was the others notified what he's talking about he preached to the souls that were in hell now what's the point okay where's it at I'll find it coming down to it he preached with that same kind of a body glorified one he preached to the souls that were in hell that repented not in the long suffering are you getting the point when he rose you get to the point what I'm talking about he preached to those who were of what you would call repentant Christians as we would call them that day Abraham Sarah right and he testified to who he was but he also preached to the one who repented not they were there in their home what body that they lived were living in their soul they said what the scripture said technically the scripture says Spirits in prison but you know what your Prophet said he said Souls that were in prison they repented not in long suffering all right because her spirits wasn't there it's just like I've always tried to tell you you take if you don't believe it come sit down we'll look at it you take the word Spirit you take the word soul and run it through your your constraints concordance you'll come out with the same definition so don't get flip-flopped just cause one time you might say something brought around and wasn't changing that it was the souls that were in prison who repented not see we think well now what it was the the Abraham and him they was in their soul we'll go along with that but these others was over here in a spirit no Spirits are never judged and don't say the spirit that sent us he'll die there's a soul those people in hell are there in a real body themselves which is their soul you follow me if not right questions I'm trying to bring it on around to where we can just tie this together and we'll pick it up Wednesday as questions and answers I believe a sinner has a soul don't you and I believe when he dies that soul will go as it's used in the scripture is technically oh you can use it three different ways show Gahanna Hades which each one of them will refer to the grave and then the others will refer to a holding place you know because that's where they're at and Jesus went and preached to those sold in prison but he didn't bring them out but he preached to the ones that we just read on Earth that had repented the ones that were real genuine people you preached to them and he was able to bring them out right why because they were in their soul what do you think what's going to happen to you the day you die I mean it doesn't make you feel good to realize that it's not like we used to be come on what you used to think about dying right not much different than anybody else had we just kicked the bucket and we don't know what it's going to be we're just going to float around somewhere do something happens in him uh-huh may I say it this way what about the illustrations brother Branham gave of the old man that was struck by the car right the people saw the card felt at lunch but they went back and they couldn't find a man what about it what about it Jocelyn he runs into a tree and ain't nobody in the carpet him but three two or three people in another car show a man get out of Josh's car and walk off now I'm sure you'd have problem trying to convince them that they didn't see it how close is that world brother random gave it this way and a slant maybe 20 feet away right what did he mean I don't know I don't know what a slant means in Bible terminology I do know that there are dimensions and in that Dimension the fourth dimension is like TV things like that Supernatural things happening Fifth Dimension is the center dead the sixth dimensioners are sold under the altar Now where's all of them other people where's your foolish virgin that's Fearless virgin ever age you agree where's the foolish version don't send them to hell and bring them out that doesn't work too good but don't put them in with a bride that don't work too good so in that sixth Dimension must be a lot of different dimensional situations I'm just trying to get you to think about God being real but brother Dale I've always been taught that my theophany was up you under the sky and one of these days I'll go to it right but I'd like you to read that scripture it says if this Earthly Tabernacle were dissolved we have one waiting is it dire if you read it I've got it in here you want to find it out of the service listening to the message he's explaining the theophany and he says we have not yet the bodies we'll pick it up Wednesday and just back up a little bit and pick up how we bypassed and what took place because too late now and how we came into the world as beings and must be born again amen that's right do you have a body up there you know that in God's mind every person that will ever receive that love of The Headstone as far as his mind is concerned they've already received it all who as far as his mind is concerned they've already received it brother random talks about now listen he talks about when he went beyond the curtain of time he talks about leaving his body and going there but remember he's a prophet God was showing him that because a lot of people claim that have these out of body experiences that doesn't match up I'm not going to tell them they didn't have one I'm just going to ask him where does it fit in the rest of the word you ever heard people talk like this bless God I'm so much trinitarian I get up to heaven one of these days and if they ain't free Thrones I'm leaving that's pretty strong here you've ever tell you like that I believe in three gods they're going to be a throne for the father and the son and what's wrong called if not then I'll be in the wrong place well I agree with that you're being the wrong place because I don't believe when we get up there it's going to be three Thrones I believe there'll be one which is Jesus Christ come on musicians think on these things we'll background a little bit Wednesday and take it on to where what we bypassed and how we come into the world and then we'll have questions and answers but take on these things how real do you think God is and how real do you think your Prophet has described you as being when there's something in her old days we used to wonder what a heaven be like oh we'll set up on clouds and play Hearts you know well I never was too good at it ain't never been too good at it down here I did ask the doctor when I was kidding with him one day I said you get this heart straightened out will I be able to play a piano he said why yes I said we're good because I ain't never been able to play one yet he kind of snarked at me a little bit what do you think about it you leave here where do you go do you go into another body you know if you leave this body do you go into another body or is that Soul leaving out of that body what you really are and just goes to another dimension because that's what your Prophet describes or how Jesus when that Soul left out of that body the body hung there right the spirit went back to God who gave it that soul that being of what he was went to hell preach to those people what do you think about it let's stand what we got 323 323 in this fire book anybody have a need his stripes we are here and by his blood what about it I'm talking about a real God I understand feelings now some Spirit you feel but when he said I'll never leave you alone thank you I'll be with you always cause sometimes we grieving he has to pull away his presence he just pulled away his presence foreign I do cause you're real well you're not inside my brother he's my savior he said eternal life Hallelujah who said his words say no we can't do it right away I don't understand and he agrees with his words get along and go put on a pair of pants because she can't do it he said well it don't bother me well I just said what he said that you can't get a holy ghost to see a woman to put on a purple hand unless don't be stupid I always ask questions I have been you know his Pastor you get some sometimes that that's so dumb until you you want to call them dumb but I try not to ask you about a woman wearing pajamas to bed what's wrong with her wearing pajamas to bed what's wrong with you going around your home will you dress over the top of your pajamas now don't run around and say brother Dale said it's hard to go wearing your pants all day I didn't say pan I said pajamas all right what's wrong in your own home that you can't stay warm you know if you was an Eskimo you'd probably half brother Brown and said brother Brown was it all right for me to wear these undergarments under here and he'd probably say yeah cause you don't you're gonna freeze to death don't bring them outside right well I don't agree with that well that's all right you tell me something sensible nobody said one time do you think it's all right my wife to to put on uh work out clothes to to work out in our home all right I don't care she goes buck naked as long as she's in the house and the doors are closed ain't no kids around right come on sorry maybe I just talked too flying let's sing that again brother I love that song they're getting everything ready are you and by his blood we are sins singing to one another as you're going to church again advice
