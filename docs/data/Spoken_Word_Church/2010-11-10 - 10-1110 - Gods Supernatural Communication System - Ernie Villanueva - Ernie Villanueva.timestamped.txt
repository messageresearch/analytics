[25:24] you to be seated just for a couple of
[25:26] minutes I'd like to give give you a
[25:28] quick update on what's taking place in
[25:31] the mission field um we sent out these
[25:35] Faith challenge reports I don't know did
[25:36] they arrive at your assembly Brother Sam
[25:39] great um I I can tell you that to me
[25:43] over the last year or so the whole the
[25:46] whole process of getting the message out
[25:50] into the hands of people all over the
[25:52] world has taken a just a Quantum Leap
[25:56] and uh the the message Hub it it
[26:00] basically is uh it's a
[26:04] multi-lingual
[26:06] operation and uh what what it does is it
[26:09] takes the library resource of brother
[26:11] brandom's message in both voice and
[26:13] print format and puts it into the hands
[26:16] of people even people in third world
[26:19] countries who are living out in in
[26:21] thatched Huts who have no access to the
[26:23] internet if they have a computer it
[26:26] doesn't have to be a real fancy computer
[26:28] and if they have one of these printers
[26:30] then uh we send them a dis and that dis
[26:33] has every message in every language
[26:36] available to them and they just plug it
[26:38] in and every month a new disc is sent to
[26:41] them and right now there's
[26:44] over50 of these Message Hubs that are
[26:46] located in various parts all over the
[26:49] world and uh right now on an average of
[26:53] every two weeks over 1,000 cities from
[26:57] 100 count countries around the world
[27:00] connect to the message Hub and download
[27:02] brother bram's messages uh just recently
[27:06] in our assembly we have had we have had
[27:08] two explosive spurts with our young
[27:11] people one of them was they wanted to
[27:14] take every message and you know many
[27:16] people when they come into the the
[27:18] revelation of Truth uh they just assume
[27:21] that all the messages are available and
[27:24] and you can just go to any message you
[27:26] want to but there are there are almost
[27:28] 700 messages that have never been
[27:30] printed they've never been put into a a
[27:33] print form and you can get them when you
[27:35] go on onto the computer you can find
[27:37] them and you can you know download them
[27:39] onto your computer but uh and many of
[27:42] the people who have translated we take
[27:44] it for granted sometimes because the
[27:46] message came in English and I am so
[27:49] thankful the message came in English I
[27:52] I'm in awe at at brother like brother
[27:54] milco from our assembly anywhere he goes
[27:57] all over Europe whether it's German or
[28:00] Italian or or Slovakian or Serbian he
[28:03] can speak he can speak enough of their
[28:05] language and within a short time God
[28:08] just puts them in that channel where
[28:10] they can they can communicate so I'm I'm
[28:12] thankful for people who can speak many
[28:14] many languages you know God only gave me
[28:16] one one language and uh you know a
[28:20] couple of I can count in a couple of
[28:21] languages and I can say how are you and
[28:24] you know thank you and a few other
[28:26] things but many people
[28:29] they are just waiting with breathless
[28:32] anticipation for a new message to come
[28:35] their way right and at this at this
[28:37] present time there are over 5,000
[28:41] messages that have been translated in 44
[28:45] languages and by the end of this year
[28:48] there will be over uh we expect to have
[28:50] 6,000 messages available in 50 languages
[28:54] amen and uh what what these
[28:59] messages have done in the beginning we
[29:01] had to have the printer and and you know
[29:03] it's always the cost factor and the cost
[29:06] Factor was the toner and the toner
[29:09] sometimes for a printer can cost
[29:11] $200 and uh we had a brother in Mexico
[29:14] and I'm so thankful for the creative
[29:17] imagination that comes with a burden and
[29:20] a vision to get the message up cuz this
[29:22] brother figured out he looked at that
[29:24] toner and he said there's no reason why
[29:26] I can't just take a little a little
[29:28] punch and I can't punch a hole in that
[29:31] toner and we can't get uh powdered ink
[29:34] and we can't fill that toner up with
[29:36] powdered ink which is what it's got in
[29:38] it in the first place and all they do is
[29:41] take a piece of tape and put that over
[29:43] it and that toner is now good to print
[29:47] about a th000 new messages and the cost
[29:50] of the the the uh the powdered ink is
[29:54] $16 as opposed to $200
[29:58] so uh we just sent over 50 consumable
[30:01] kits over to the Philippines and these
[30:04] brothers with the ink that they have now
[30:06] got they're they they have the capacity
[30:09] to print 100,000 messages amen so just
[30:13] pray that that God will give them the
[30:15] burden and God will take that message
[30:17] and send that message to the to the
[30:19] right people uh brother brother Murphy
[30:22] has been been very very busy over the
[30:24] last couple of years and and uh he he's
[30:27] got a whole team of people in China and
[30:30] and they're working on the phones back
[30:32] and forth every day they you know they
[30:34] they they get a book one translates it
[30:36] and he sends it over to another brother
[30:38] he proofreads it then they grammar
[30:40] eyesee it then they correct it and then
[30:42] it's all ready to go and and and they're
[30:44] producing like sometimes a book A Day
[30:47] translated book a day and right now 450
[30:50] message titles are now available in the
[30:53] Chinese language just over the last
[30:55] couple of years and brother Murphy has
[30:58] personally done
[31:00] 306 audio voice overs where brother
[31:03] brandom's voice and then Murphy's voice
[31:05] and brother Brandon's voice and Murphy's
[31:07] and you know to to the people in China
[31:10] that that is a it's a tremendous
[31:12] tremendous blessing to those people many
[31:14] of them have never heard the name Jesus
[31:17] Christ one time in their life brother
[31:20] Murphy was just over there and they were
[31:22] trying to get the message cood they were
[31:25] trying to get it printed they went to
[31:27] three different printers in three
[31:28] different parts of the country to get
[31:30] quotes and then they got a text message
[31:33] shortly after that and one of the
[31:36] brothers or one of the men who was who
[31:39] was giving them the quote had a print
[31:41] shop he sent back a message and he said
[31:44] is there anybody in the world who can
[31:47] baptize me in the name of the Lord Jesus
[31:50] Christ because what it happened was he
[31:52] went to the website he went to the
[31:54] website and he downloaded the messages
[31:56] and he began to he began to read them
[31:59] and then uh uh an an illness struck his
[32:02] eye you know what pink eye is right how
[32:04] how many ever had pink eye okay well he
[32:07] got pink eye his wife got pink eye his
[32:09] whole family got pink eye and he had to
[32:12] stay home from work for two weeks and in
[32:14] that two weeks he downloaded 140
[32:17] messages and he and his wife were
[32:20] reading messages for 10 to 12 hours
[32:23] every day in in the message and then the
[32:27] man was so he was so gripped he he
[32:29] belongs to one of the government
[32:31] churches a three self church and it's
[32:33] like a it's like a Catholic Church
[32:35] basically is what it is but uh you know
[32:38] they're self-governing self-propagating
[32:40] and self-supporting and that's how China
[32:43] says we have religious freedom in the
[32:45] country but it's dead as a doornail and
[32:48] so this man he is he is a high official
[32:51] he's in charge of all the evangelism all
[32:53] the Outreach all the books that go out
[32:56] all the material that come this man is
[32:58] in charge of it and now the message
[33:00] comes into his hands and he is gripped
[33:02] with the fact that a prophet has come
[33:05] and he starts passing this message out
[33:07] to all the people in the church well you
[33:10] can imagine the church leaders are not
[33:12] too happy with him right now and they
[33:14] haven't given him the left foot of
[33:16] Fellowship yet but he knows he's on the
[33:18] way out but he doesn't he doesn't care
[33:20] he says I'm going to stay here until
[33:22] they kick me out but at the same time I
[33:25] will not compromise the stand and every
[33:27] body I come in contact with I am going
[33:29] to tell them the most important news
[33:32] that I have ever heard or any human
[33:33] being has ever heard and that is that
[33:35] God has sent Elijah the prophet before
[33:38] the great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[33:40] to turn the hearts of the children back
[33:42] to the faith of the fathers and that's
[33:45] our mandate that's our mission that
[33:47] should be our great Magnificent
[33:49] Obsession is to have our hearts turned
[33:52] back to the faith of the fathers and
[33:55] that can only come one way God knew that
[33:57] that to turn the hearts back to the
[33:59] faith of the fathers that he had to come
[34:01] once again in a Vindicated prophet and
[34:05] that Prophet would be able to come and
[34:07] preach the word and unveil Christ to the
[34:10] people and demonstrate Christ to the
[34:12] people in a way that had that had not
[34:15] been done since the day that Christ
[34:17] walked on the earth and in a greater
[34:20] measure Christ like brother brandom said
[34:22] Jesus did more in just one of his
[34:25] meetings than is recorded in the entire
[34:27] Bible now we know the Bible said you
[34:29] know if all the works that Jesus had
[34:31] done were recorded all the the you know
[34:34] the libraries of the the books of the
[34:35] world would not be able to hold them but
[34:38] we know there was many many hundreds of
[34:41] thousands of healings and dramatic
[34:43] Supernatural events that took place in
[34:45] the life of the prophet and that's
[34:47] that's what the people need they need to
[34:49] see that they need to hear that they
[34:51] need to hear that voice and uh
[34:57] my little book go here oh th this is the
[35:01] latest thing this is this is something
[35:03] we never knew this printer would do and
[35:06] it was again all these 150 print
[35:09] operators each one of them brings a
[35:11] little bit of a different element to the
[35:13] table a little bit of a different
[35:15] knowledge a little bit of different
[35:16] experience a little wisdom and uh and so
[35:19] they have now got this book down to a
[35:22] pocket siiz book where you can just take
[35:24] it and just put it right into your
[35:27] pocket
[35:28] just just like that and have it
[35:31] available and ready to hand out and the
[35:33] cost of a book like this is 5 cents that
[35:37] means for a dollar you can print 20 of
[35:40] these books and and I was showing at the
[35:42] Sam and if anybody wants to look at it
[35:44] after the service you're more than
[35:46] welcome and the print is very very good
[35:49] very readable and these these can be
[35:52] produced 100 of them in an hour can be
[35:56] produced and and the large siiz books if
[35:58] somebody wants a full-size book they can
[36:01] be produced for 10 cents a book and uh
[36:05] there's there's there's no no
[36:07] Transportation cost no Customs no Duty
[36:11] uh you know no distribution none of that
[36:13] everything is available if a brother has
[36:16] got a computer and he's got a printer
[36:18] and uh and of course a a a a cutter and
[36:21] a stapler goes with that but he is a
[36:24] Onan Supernatural printing operation
[36:27] he's got the word available to put into
[36:30] the hands of the people and uh and so if
[36:33] you would pray that we'd be able to to
[36:35] get these you know and it's so simple
[36:37] all somebody's got to do is they got to
[36:39] go to www messut messag hub.in and they
[36:43] just opens up and whatever language you
[36:46] want to look at you can look at that
[36:48] language then you go to the year that
[36:51] you want to then you go to the message
[36:52] that you want to and they just print
[36:55] they just push that button for that
[36:56] message and the printer just takes and
[36:59] prints it out so if a pastor wants to
[37:01] have a a message that they've never had
[37:04] before and they want to be able maybe to
[37:06] play brother brandom's voice and have
[37:08] the people in the congregation be able
[37:10] to read a book that they've never ever
[37:12] ever had access to before that is now
[37:15] available and I'm sure you folks have
[37:17] been in services like that and you've
[37:19] heard brother Brandon preach and be able
[37:21] to read it and you get it both ways you
[37:23] get it in the eye gate and you get it in
[37:25] the ear gate and it goes to that mind
[37:27] gate goes down to the heart gate real
[37:29] quick and uh and so the this this whole
[37:32] message Hub can be delivered to Africa
[37:36] India uh in the Spanish countries right
[37:39] now the Spanish is the most active group
[37:43] of people we have anywhere in the
[37:45] message over 200 Spanish messages are
[37:49] downloaded every day that's just what we
[37:51] know from the website now there may be
[37:54] many of these people who are just
[37:55] putting the disc in there and just
[37:57] downloading them right from the disc and
[37:59] we don't have any any knowledge of them
[38:02] and so we can take one of these whole
[38:04] systems and put it into a church for
[38:07] $1,200 and so that that person now
[38:09] becomes he becomes a printer of the most
[38:12] Supernatural message that the world has
[38:15] has ever known so uh we thank you for
[38:18] your support over the years brother the
[38:20] Bisal asked me to send his greetings and
[38:22] his thanks to you we're just in meetings
[38:25] in uh in Murphy's Boro over the weekend
[38:28] and we had a wonderful time and uh
[38:30] brother Murphy also asked me to send
[38:32] greetings and brother milco also I don't
[38:34] know if all of you people know know them
[38:36] but they were at the meetings several
[38:38] years ago in Gainesville and uh you know
[38:40] people are still talking about what a
[38:43] wonderful that was one of the most
[38:44] wonderful meetings we've ever had
[38:46] anywhere at any time and uh you know I
[38:49] I'll never forget you know mo most times
[38:53] when you go into a meeting uh there has
[38:57] to to be there has to be expenses and
[38:59] usually the expenses are taken out of
[39:02] the offering and and and and the rents
[39:04] paid and you know all the all the uh
[39:07] expenses for the meeting are paid but
[39:10] your church was the first church that I
[39:12] know of that didn't want to have any any
[39:16] of the offering go to anywhere but to
[39:19] missions your church paid for the
[39:22] building your church paid for for for
[39:24] for everything to make that meeting
[39:26] happy and and we never forget that and I
[39:28] know brother Ed will never forget that
[39:30] we we appreciate that amen and uh so I
[39:34] maybe I'd like to just read something to
[39:36] you uh this is It's entitled the
[39:39] preacher who would be wrongly judged and
[39:43] uh one of the toughest toughest tasks
[39:45] the church faces is choosing a new
[39:48] Minister a member of an official board
[39:51] undergoing this painful process finally
[39:54] lost patience he'd watched the Pastoral
[39:57] Rel committee reject applicant after
[39:59] applicant for some fault alleged or
[40:02] otherwise so it was time for a bit of
[40:04] soul searching on the part of the
[40:05] committee so he stood up and he read a
[40:08] letter reporting to be from another
[40:10] applicant for the position of the pastor
[40:13] at the church it read like this
[40:16] gentlemen understanding your Pulpit is
[40:18] vacant I should like to apply for the
[40:21] position I have many qualifications I've
[40:23] been a preacher with much success and
[40:26] have had some succcess
[40:27] as a writer some say I'm a good
[40:29] organizer and I've been a leader in most
[40:32] places where I've been I am however over
[40:35] 50 years of age and I have never
[40:37] preached in one place for more than 3
[40:39] years in some places I have left town
[40:42] after my work as caused riots and
[40:44] disturbances I must admit I've been in
[40:47] jail three or four times but not because
[40:49] of any real wrongdoing I'm my part my
[40:52] health is not too good although I still
[40:54] get a great deal done the churches I
[40:57] have preached in have been small though
[40:59] located in large cities I've not gotten
[41:02] along very well with the religious
[41:04] leaders in the towns where I have
[41:07] preached in fact some have threatened me
[41:10] and even attacked me
[41:11] physically I'm not too good at keeping
[41:14] records and I have been known even to
[41:16] forget whom I have baptized however if
[41:19] you can use me I shall do my best for
[41:22] you yeah so the board member looked over
[41:25] the committee and he said well what do
[41:26] you think
[41:28] shall we call him and the good folks
[41:32] were a gassed and said what call an
[41:35] unhealthy troublemaking absentminded ex
[41:39] jailbird was the board member Crazy who
[41:42] signed the application who had such
[41:45] colossal nerve and the board member eyed
[41:48] them keenly before he answered and he
[41:50] said it signed the Apostle
[41:53] Paul and so uh what a paradox
[41:57] and uh people would have to have a real
[41:59] paradigm shift to be able to to to to
[42:02] look beyond the cover and to see what
[42:05] was lying behind that cover God bless
[42:07] you let's stand to our feet and I'd like
[42:09] to invite
[42:11] you to open your
[42:13] Bibles to the book of
[42:17] Ephesians chapter 1 and verse
[42:24] 1 before we read let's pray
[42:31] father we count this a a great
[42:33] privilege to come before you as your
[42:37] children we come with with reverence and
[42:40] humility and sincerity but yet Lord we
[42:44] come as children who understand that you
[42:47] have made an entrance for us that we can
[42:49] come boldly before the throne of grace
[42:53] and Lord we know that you are a high
[42:55] priest sitting at the right hand of
[42:57] majesty waiting to make good any of the
[43:00] confessions that we make that are
[43:03] according to the Redemptive blessings of
[43:06] the Resurrection in the word so Lord we
[43:09] ask that you would lead and guide and
[43:11] direct us tonight I pray father that you
[43:14] would take my lips use them as a Pulpit
[43:17] for your word I pray that you would hide
[43:20] all flesh for All Flesh will come to not
[43:24] father we don't come with human AB
[43:27] ability we just depend upon the unction
[43:29] and the anointing of your Holy Spirit to
[43:32] speak what needs to be spoken so Lord I
[43:35] pray that each person would come in
[43:38] great anticipation and expectation with
[43:41] their cups ready to be filled from the
[43:44] Bounty of your blessings we ask all all
[43:48] these things Lord all these petitions in
[43:50] your precious and wonderful name of our
[43:53] Lord Jesus Christ amen amen Ephesians 1
[43:58] and verse
[44:00] 1 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the
[44:04] will of God to the Saints which are at
[44:07] Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ
[44:10] Jesus Grace be to you and peace from God
[44:12] our Father and from the Lord Jesus
[44:14] Christ blessed be the God and father of
[44:17] our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed
[44:19] us with all spiritual blessings in
[44:23] Heavenly places in Christ according
[44:27] as he hath chosen Us in him before the
[44:31] foundation of the world that we should
[44:33] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[44:38] love now in order for a person to really
[44:41] internalize that scripture they have to
[44:44] have an upto-date revelation of
[44:47] justification I am so thankful of
[44:51] justification without that you know
[44:53] without that a person could go no
[44:55] further without that the guilt and the
[44:57] shame and the condemnation and the
[44:59] humiliation of our past it would be it
[45:02] it would be something that the devil
[45:04] would use to come and torment us on a
[45:06] regular basis as he did through many
[45:10] many many years when I was in
[45:12] denominations you know you go to church
[45:14] you get all filled up and then during
[45:16] the week you'd come back and you feel
[45:18] like you had to go back to the altar
[45:20] again but when the revelation of
[45:22] justification and an upto-date
[45:25] experience that you have been cleansed
[45:28] and purified and that you have been
[45:31] called before the foundation of the
[45:33] world and God sees you as a holy
[45:36] virtuous blameless bride of Jesus Christ
[45:39] to get that understanding and that
[45:41] Revelation and to have that Armor of God
[45:43] on so when the Devil comes with his
[45:45] attacks you've got your armor of God on
[45:47] and you can just come and you can step
[45:49] on that Serpent's neck I know every day
[45:52] when I wake up there's got to be two
[45:54] deaths I got to die and the devil's got
[45:56] to
[45:57] and so I say I'm going to die early and
[46:00] the devil's going to die early just get
[46:02] it over right first thing in the morning
[46:04] shut that yapping dog up right first in
[46:07] the morning put him in his place and
[46:09] move on and do what God has called you
[46:11] to do for that
[46:14] day having predestinated us under the
[46:17] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[46:19] himself according to the good pleasure
[46:21] of his will to the praise of his glory
[46:24] wherein Heath made us accepted in the
[46:26] beloved he hath made us accepted in the
[46:29] Beloved in whom we have Redemption
[46:31] through the blood the Forgiveness of
[46:33] sins according to the riches of his
[46:35] grace wherein Heath abounded to us in
[46:37] all wisdom and Prudence having made
[46:39] known unto us the mystery of his will
[46:43] I'd like to speak tonight about the
[46:45] supernatural communication system that
[46:48] God uses to his children so having made
[46:51] known unto us the mystery of his will
[46:53] according to his good pleasure which he
[46:56] hath purposed in himself that in the
[46:58] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[47:00] might gather together in one all things
[47:02] in Christ both which are in heaven and
[47:05] which are on earth even in him in whom
[47:08] also we have obtained an inheritance
[47:11] being predestinated according to the
[47:14] purpose of him who worketh all things
[47:16] after the counsel of his own will in
[47:19] verse 17 that the god of our Lord Jesus
[47:23] Christ the father of Glory may give unto
[47:26] you the spirit
[47:27] of wisdom and Revelation in the
[47:30] knowledge of him the eyes of your
[47:34] understanding being enlightened that you
[47:36] may know what is the hope of his calling
[47:39] and what the riches of the glory of his
[47:41] inheritance and the Saints and what is
[47:43] the exceeding greatness of his power to
[47:46] us with who believe according to the
[47:49] working of his mighty power amen God
[47:52] bless you you may have your your seats
[48:02] now each one of us who studies this
[48:06] word and understands what God has done
[48:09] in this day you become a Believer now a
[48:12] believer of this message is a
[48:16] superintelligent being with a Divine
[48:19] Purpose in your life God knew you before
[48:23] the foundation of the world he knew each
[48:25] one of us God knew that I would be
[48:27] standing here tonight God knew every
[48:30] every person that would be here tonight
[48:32] he knows what your needs are and each
[48:35] person here is at a different stage of
[48:37] growth and development some here are in
[48:39] need of Salvation some are in need of
[48:42] Deliverance some are in need of healing
[48:44] some are in need of Direction some are
[48:47] some are in need of of of knowing what
[48:50] God's perfect will is for our life and
[48:53] and and and and that should be something
[48:55] that consumes and possesses and absorbs
[48:58] us when you come to the revelation of
[49:01] this truth we know that it wasn't us
[49:04] going looking for God it was God who
[49:06] came looking for us but then when God
[49:09] found us now God he encouraged us and
[49:13] exorts us to seek after him diligently
[49:17] with all of our heart with all of our
[49:19] mind with all of our soul with every
[49:21] with every fiber of our being to search
[49:24] after God he's worthy he's worthy of all
[49:27] praise all honor and all glory without
[49:30] him we would be nothing but with him we
[49:34] can do all things greater is he that is
[49:37] in us than he that is that is in the
[49:40] world and uh in in the the church age
[49:43] book this is something is very familiar
[49:46] but I I just want to start with this
[49:48] brother brandom said you recall that I
[49:49] mentioned at the beginning of this
[49:50] message that this book we are studying
[49:53] is the actual revelation of Jesus
[49:55] himself in the church is work in the
[49:57] future ages then I mention that it takes
[49:59] the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or
[50:02] we will fail to get it think of the
[50:05] hundreds of thousands or maybe even
[50:07] millions of preachers around the world
[50:10] who study and go to church on Sunday
[50:13] some most of them only go to church once
[50:14] a week sometimes twice a week I'm so
[50:17] thankful we go three or four times a
[50:18] week but but think of these people and
[50:21] the pastor he goes He studies he prays
[50:24] he thinks he has a thought for the
[50:25] people the people come the church
[50:27] thinking that the pastor has a word for
[50:29] them that's going to encourage them and
[50:32] they have faith and confidence in their
[50:34] pastor and the pastor has faith and
[50:36] confidence that he has heard from God
[50:38] but of all those hundreds of thousands
[50:40] or millions of preachers who preach the
[50:42] sermons every sermon they preach this
[50:45] year last year for the last five or 10
[50:48] or 20 years not one of those sermons has
[50:51] ever produced a new birth
[50:54] right because the new birth brother
[50:56] Brandon says there's one evidence of the
[50:58] new birth and that is that you can
[51:00] receive the revelation of truth that God
[51:03] has sent for your day and manifest the
[51:06] life right and they can't do it right
[51:09] they're not they're not preaching the
[51:10] message they have no knowledge of the
[51:12] message and so they preach and people
[51:14] come forward maybe they have an
[51:16] experience with God you know but that
[51:19] that's between them and God they they
[51:21] may be foolish virgins we we don't know
[51:23] that they may they may do something good
[51:26] for the and be our brother and sister in
[51:28] heaven we don't these these things are
[51:30] in God's hands but what I'm saying is
[51:33] these people cannot have the experience
[51:36] that God has made available to you it's
[51:39] a treasure it's an inheritance that God
[51:42] has given to us and it's not something
[51:44] that we should take lightly this is this
[51:47] is the greatest opportunity you'll ever
[51:50] have in your life but it also has the
[51:53] great accountability and the great
[51:55] responsibility
[51:57] and that word responsibility if you
[51:59] break it down response ability do you
[52:02] have the ability to respond to the
[52:05] gospel and only a Son of God only one
[52:08] with a c Gene of God inside of them has
[52:11] the the the opportunity and the
[52:13] availability to respond to the word in a
[52:16] favorable manner glory and so I mention
[52:21] it takes the Holy Spirit to give us
[52:22] Revelation or we'll fail to get it
[52:24] bringing these two thoughts together
[52:26] you'll see that it won't take just
[52:27] ordinary study and thinking to make this
[52:30] book real it's going to take the
[52:32] operation of the Holy Ghost that means
[52:34] this book can't be revealed to anyone
[52:37] but a special class of people now the
[52:39] devil may beat you down the devil may
[52:42] tell you every sin you ever committed
[52:44] that's his job that's his he's got that
[52:47] right brother brandom talked about he
[52:49] said you can't prevent the birds from
[52:51] flying overhead but you can't you can't
[52:53] prevent the birds from making a bird's
[52:54] nest in your hair your head and so the
[52:58] devil has access to our mind but we have
[53:01] power to cast down memory cast down
[53:03] imagination cast down reason cast down
[53:06] everything that exalted itself against
[53:09] the knowledge of God it's a weapon that
[53:11] God has placed in the hands of a
[53:13] Believer and you must take that
[53:15] authority over the devil don't take that
[53:18] Authority lightly don't let the devil
[53:21] bully you there's a lot of talk about
[53:23] bullying going on in schools nowadays
[53:25] there's a lot of bul going on by the
[53:27] devil every day and he gets away with it
[53:30] by people who don't know their position
[53:32] in Christ right it will take a special
[53:36] class of people it'll take one with
[53:37] prophetic Insight it'll require the
[53:39] ability to hear from God it will require
[53:42] Supernatural instruction not just a
[53:45] student comparing verse with verse
[53:47] though that is good but a mystery
[53:49] requires the teaching of the spirit or
[53:51] it never becomes clear how we need to
[53:55] hear from God and lay ourselves open and
[53:58] become yielded to the spirit to hear and
[54:01] to know I'm so thankful that that that
[54:04] that God has opened opened the message
[54:08] the message to me now you may have heard
[54:10] me say this before but it's real to me
[54:13] the message is a supernatural
[54:15] multiplication of inspiration and
[54:17] Revelation for communication with God
[54:21] God has opened up access to us just like
[54:24] just like Jacob he saw the angel you
[54:26] know going up the ladder God has given
[54:29] us that same privilege to go up that
[54:31] ladder go up seven steps God has given
[54:33] the to go up Seven Church ages to go up
[54:36] Seven Seals know other people on the
[54:38] face of the Earth you think about it
[54:40] friends many of the people who followed
[54:43] brother brandom's Ministry in the late
[54:46] 40s when the Great Revival the great
[54:48] healing Revival was spawned and they
[54:50] followed him during the 50s and oh my
[54:54] all over the the religious world I'm not
[54:56] saying the World At Large but many in
[54:59] the religious World said oh God has
[55:01] raised up a great man of God amongst us
[55:04] and those who were inclined to know
[55:06] about the things of God they were aware
[55:08] of brother brandham and his presence and
[55:12] the stories that they had heard about
[55:15] him but in
[55:17] 1958 when he preached the seed of the
[55:20] serpent friends it caused millions of
[55:24] people who had a favorable impression of
[55:27] brother brandham to go away right and
[55:31] brother brandham says sometimes you have
[55:34] to say things to thin out the crowd
[55:37] because there's too many following the
[55:39] message now that's a paradox because
[55:41] here we are we want to do everything we
[55:44] can to get the message out but at the
[55:47] same time the message many times says
[55:50] things to them that makes them go away
[55:52] like the 70 Jesus commissioned them he
[55:55] ordained them he sent them out they had
[55:57] power they cast out demons they come
[55:59] back rejoicing and Jesus said don't
[56:01] Rejoice because of that but Rejoice of
[56:03] your name is written in the Book of Life
[56:06] he said unless you drink this blood and
[56:08] eat this flesh you have no part with me
[56:11] and and and brother Bron that staggered
[56:12] him and he says oh does that stagger you
[56:15] what are you going to do when you see
[56:16] the son of man ascending and descending
[56:18] from where he came from they said that's
[56:20] it we are out of here right y
[56:24] bye-bye and Jesus he never said now hold
[56:27] on guys just wait wait you know it'll
[56:31] come clear to you in a while I I'll
[56:33] explain it to you I I'll help you I'll
[56:35] help you to understand no they just
[56:38] walked away and Jesus turned to the
[56:41] other Apostles and said will you also go
[56:43] away and they said Lord where would we
[56:47] go you have the words of eternal life
[56:51] right and so God comes and God through
[56:54] his Supernatural Communications system
[56:56] I'd like to just read one one verse of
[56:59] scripture for you it's in Amos 3 and
[57:02] verse 1 uh and and I'll just go quickly
[57:05] I don't I want to preserve time hear
[57:07] this word that the Lord has spoken
[57:09] against you oh children of Israel
[57:11] against the whole family which I brought
[57:13] up from the land of Egypt saying you
[57:15] only have I known of all the families of
[57:19] the earth you know we can we can take
[57:21] that that's a type of us we are the only
[57:24] ones that God has known the only ones
[57:27] that God has become intimate with
[57:29] spiritually and supernaturally intimate
[57:32] with the other ones are going to come
[57:34] and when they come to Jesus he's going
[57:35] to say depart from me you that worketh
[57:38] iniquity for I never knew you I never
[57:42] become intimate with you you were never
[57:44] pregnated with my spirit with the Holy
[57:47] Spirit you are pregnated by a man's
[57:49] Spirit you're pregnated by a
[57:51] denominational Spirit which is simply
[57:53] the mark of the beast brother the
[57:55] brandom said that when some little group
[57:57] that started off became the
[58:00] monstrosity of Satan that's what they
[58:03] are they might look good have nice
[58:05] temples you know have nice churches call
[58:08] themselves nice names have you know
[58:10] beautiful choirs all dressed up have TV
[58:13] broadcast radio broadcast do good things
[58:16] feed the poor visit the sick go to the
[58:19] prison do all those things but they are
[58:22] doing it all in the power of the flesh
[58:25] under an anointing a man-made anointing
[58:28] sure that's right it's not something God
[58:30] you know brother Brandon brings it out
[58:32] God said go and preach the gospel he
[58:35] didn't say go build hospitals and go
[58:38] build schools and go build Bible uh
[58:40] seminaries and the the the more a person
[58:43] goes to Bible school or seminary School
[58:46] the further away from God they go it
[58:49] take you know brother random said when
[58:50] the Fire gets lit that's when a man
[58:52] should go out and preach the gospel and
[58:55] especially anybody who's in the message
[58:58] you're in the school of the prophets
[59:00] every time you come to church and you
[59:02] hear this message preached by an
[59:04] anointed minister of this message you
[59:06] are in the school of the prophets you we
[59:09] have children who are eight and nine and
[59:11] 10 years old they can out preach Billy
[59:14] Graham they can out preach all the men
[59:16] that are on television they know how
[59:18] many gods there are they know what
[59:20] happened in the garden they know they
[59:21] know how to be baptized they know all
[59:24] these things they know the prophet of
[59:26] God is in this day they know how to
[59:29] dress you know brother Murphy was
[59:31] talking uh just after he left one of the
[59:33] meetings when he was in China it was the
[59:35] very place that two years ago that that
[59:38] the the the women were arrested and 30
[59:41] women they went to jail because they
[59:44] were wearing
[59:47] skirts mous Tong when he came into Power
[59:50] he had all them dressed alike men and
[59:52] women all dressed the same and for a
[59:55] woman to have a dress on only
[59:58] prostitutes wore dresses and yet these
[1:00:01] sisters when they heard the message even
[1:00:04] though they knew in their culture they
[1:00:06] were going to be looked upon as a
[1:00:08] prostitute now I know some people look
[1:00:11] at you and think you're oldfashioned
[1:00:13] yeah it's a lot different from being
[1:00:16] thought of being oldfashioned and being
[1:00:18] looked at as a prostitute that's right
[1:00:21] see and and and these sisters were
[1:00:23] arrested and they were thrown in jail
[1:00:25] for a month for wearing dresses and as
[1:00:29] soon as they were released from jail
[1:00:31] they went right back and got their
[1:00:32] sewing machines and got their needle and
[1:00:34] thread and sewed more dresses and
[1:00:36] they've been wearing those dresses ever
[1:00:38] since and by the grace of God they have
[1:00:40] not been deterred although they still
[1:00:43] looked on with reproach but they
[1:00:46] consider that an honor to Bear the
[1:00:49] reproach of God you know somebody might
[1:00:51] think they look at you and your long
[1:00:53] dress and your long hair they said oh
[1:00:56] that's the oldfashioned model no that's
[1:00:58] not the oldfashioned model that's the
[1:01:00] Eternal model that's what it is Heaven's
[1:01:03] going to be full of that that's right
[1:01:05] amen and so yet you only have I known of
[1:01:08] all the families of the earth therefore
[1:01:10] I will punish you for all your
[1:01:12] iniquities can two walk together except
[1:01:14] they be agreed will a lion roar in the
[1:01:17] forest when he hath no prey will a young
[1:01:20] lion cry out of his den if he hath taken
[1:01:23] nothing can a bird fall in a snare upon
[1:01:26] the Earth where no gin is for him shall
[1:01:28] one take up a snare from the earth and
[1:01:30] have taken Nothing At All Shall a
[1:01:32] trumpet be blown in the city and the
[1:01:34] people not be afraid shall there be evil
[1:01:37] in a city and the Lord hath not done it
[1:01:40] surely the Lord God will do nothing but
[1:01:43] he revealed his Secrets unto his
[1:01:46] servants the prophets and in this day
[1:01:49] friends in our day God has done
[1:01:51] wonderful things in our day first of all
[1:01:54] he has he has introduced uced us to a
[1:01:57] supernatural
[1:01:59] civilization through his life through
[1:02:01] his ministry and even later on in his
[1:02:04] ministry when he still thought you know
[1:02:07] didn't know had had no idea what was
[1:02:09] going to happen in the next life was he
[1:02:12] going to be a cloud was he going to be a
[1:02:14] cloud floating around and and maybe say
[1:02:16] hi brother Neville hi brother Brandon
[1:02:18] you know I mean think about that a man
[1:02:20] who had those kind of experiences with
[1:02:23] God and an angel of the Lord came and
[1:02:26] instructed him and taught him and showed
[1:02:28] him in the Bible you have to you have to
[1:02:30] fulfill this scripture you have to
[1:02:32] fulfill this scripture you have to
[1:02:34] fulfill this scripture imagine having an
[1:02:36] angel of the Lord for your teacher for
[1:02:39] your instructor and yet still you know
[1:02:42] it was a progressive revelation that
[1:02:45] brother brandham had all the way up to
[1:02:48] the end of his ministry I so appreciate
[1:02:50] the humility of a man who can look at
[1:02:53] what he taught before and
[1:02:56] for one one example he used to teach
[1:02:59] Body Spirit Body Soul Spirit Body Soul
[1:03:01] Spirit but at the end of his ministry he
[1:03:04] corrected himself it is Body Spirit soul
[1:03:07] the soul is the inner Court the soul is
[1:03:10] the holy of holies where you dwell and
[1:03:13] God comes in and takes a hold of that
[1:03:15] control tower and if he controls the
[1:03:17] soul the soul will control the spirit
[1:03:20] and the spirit will bring the body under
[1:03:23] control brother brandom he said says
[1:03:26] therefore the entire Bible is the
[1:03:28] revelation of God's mystery in Christ
[1:03:31] the entire Bible is an expression of one
[1:03:33] goal that God had one purpose he wanted
[1:03:36] to achieve in the entire Bible and the
[1:03:38] acts of the Believers in the Bible has
[1:03:41] been en tyed and expressing what God's
[1:03:43] Great goal is and now in this last day
[1:03:45] he has revealed it and he shows it and
[1:03:48] and God's help will see it right here
[1:03:50] this morning what the Lord has had in
[1:03:52] his mind all along and has expressed it
[1:03:54] therefore you can see the great meaning
[1:03:57] of what has been to know this and then
[1:03:59] try to bring it to the people can you
[1:04:02] imagine the pressure on one man a human
[1:04:06] being especially one that the devil
[1:04:09] continually beat him up over his
[1:04:12] education over his lack of an ability to
[1:04:16] speak and and and the ridicule that
[1:04:19] other people poured on him there was one
[1:04:21] there was one man and he was a believer
[1:04:23] of this message and I met met him one
[1:04:26] time he came to Vancouver and we were
[1:04:29] talking and and he said he said oh he
[1:04:32] said brother branam he says I love the
[1:04:34] message he said but brother brandham he
[1:04:37] sure slaughtered the queen's English
[1:04:39] yeah and I said well he might have
[1:04:41] Slaughter the queen's English but he
[1:04:43] knew The King's English real good that
[1:04:45] was the important thing to know amen and
[1:04:50] so so brother brandom says he says uh he
[1:04:53] saids do you like to read between the
[1:04:54] lines he said why the best part of the
[1:04:57] Bible is wrote between the lines sure it
[1:05:00] is and can you imagine going to a Bible
[1:05:02] school and says well you know I I learn
[1:05:04] by reading between the lines you know
[1:05:07] they wouldn't accept that no but when
[1:05:09] you look at the Bible God gives a
[1:05:12] supernatural eag Insight a vision that
[1:05:16] that only comes by Revelation and
[1:05:18] Revelation is a gift and brother BR said
[1:05:20] it can never be
[1:05:22] overemphasized the importance of
[1:05:24] Revelation we need it more we we need it
[1:05:27] on a continual basis you know it's
[1:05:30] wonderful when when you come to church
[1:05:32] and a and a Gifted Man stands behind the
[1:05:35] pulpit and preaches and and and and
[1:05:37] opens up something in the word that you
[1:05:39] never saw before but it's more wonderful
[1:05:42] to be able to go into the message
[1:05:43] yourself and be able to read it and let
[1:05:46] God begin to open things up to you and
[1:05:49] God start to put all the pieces together
[1:05:51] and and it fits everything together like
[1:05:53] a hand goes into a glove and you know
[1:05:56] it's a personal a personal encounter
[1:05:59] that you have had a supernatural
[1:06:01] encounter that you have had with deity
[1:06:03] that he has exposed himself to you as I
[1:06:08] told you the other night the Bible is
[1:06:09] hid from every Seminary you don't know
[1:06:12] God by the Seminary experience you know
[1:06:14] him by a born again experience that's
[1:06:18] the only that's the only way that it
[1:06:20] comes brother brandom says now I'm a
[1:06:23] typologist now this this is the shocking
[1:06:26] statement he says I am a typologist and
[1:06:31] any man that knows the Bible is a
[1:06:37] typologist how can you imagine I I
[1:06:39] talked to a brother uh it was about 10
[1:06:41] years ago but this brother had been
[1:06:43] preaching for 15 years in the message
[1:06:46] and he just came across that quote and
[1:06:48] he said you know I just read where
[1:06:50] brother brandom said if a man's going to
[1:06:51] know the Bible he's going to be a
[1:06:53] typologist he said I better start
[1:06:55] studying the
[1:06:56] types I am so thankful friends that God
[1:07:00] has given us types and and God has said
[1:07:04] this type is for you right amen God has
[1:07:08] shown us what happened in in heaven he
[1:07:12] showed us that onethird of all the
[1:07:15] Angels were there and Lucifer was the
[1:07:18] most beautiful he was the most gifted he
[1:07:21] was the most anointed and he was
[1:07:23] successful in deceiving one thir of all
[1:07:26] the angels in heaven into leading a
[1:07:29] rebellion against God now did that take
[1:07:32] God by surprise absolutely not God knew
[1:07:35] it God knows everything he's omnipotent
[1:07:38] he's omnicient he's omnipresent and he
[1:07:42] can predestinate by for knowledge he
[1:07:45] knows each one that's his they're
[1:07:47] engraved in the palm of his hand not if
[1:07:49] you were there in the in the mind of God
[1:07:51] before the foundation of the world there
[1:07:53] is nothing that can happen you in your
[1:07:56] lifetime before you pass either by the
[1:07:59] grave or by Rapture there's nothing that
[1:08:01] can hinder you from your predestinated
[1:08:04] destination I'm so thankful for that and
[1:08:07] so our mission is to be consumed with
[1:08:11] having our hearts turned back to the
[1:08:13] word and it's only by Revelation can can
[1:08:16] this happen to us brother brandom says
[1:08:20] he says uh we have other things that we
[1:08:22] think of that are more important my
[1:08:24] brother and my sister
[1:08:26] the most important thing in your life
[1:08:30] is I wonder if somebody just asked you
[1:08:34] what is the most important thing in your
[1:08:38] life now most of you probably know what
[1:08:40] I'm going to say because you know the
[1:08:41] message but brother brandom said the
[1:08:43] most important thing in your life is to
[1:08:48] entertain Jesus Christen right not
[1:08:51] entertain your flesh not ABC NBC CBS not
[1:08:56] the movies not Sports not business not
[1:08:59] politics none of those things your most
[1:09:02] important thing is to entertain Jesus
[1:09:05] Christ and you entertain Jesus Christ by
[1:09:09] living a life a Life of Christ a life
[1:09:12] that is dedicated a life that is
[1:09:14] Sanctified a life that is committed to
[1:09:17] to showing how much God means to you we
[1:09:21] only get one chance to prove to God how
[1:09:24] much we love him
[1:09:25] and sad to say many times it's when
[1:09:28] people have fallen into ill health and
[1:09:31] and their health is declining and they
[1:09:34] don't have strength they don't have
[1:09:35] energy they don't have the stamina but
[1:09:38] now that they're in that that condition
[1:09:40] they look back through the tunnel of
[1:09:42] time and they see what they could have
[1:09:45] done they see what they should have done
[1:09:49] one of one of the two things I was
[1:09:52] speaking about we had young people in
[1:09:54] our congregation who had a burden for
[1:09:56] the word some of these children are as
[1:09:59] young as 12 and 13 and 14 years old and
[1:10:03] their burden was to make sure that every
[1:10:06] message that brother brandom ever spoke
[1:10:10] was
[1:10:11] transcribed and put into a format in
[1:10:13] other words they had to retype all the
[1:10:16] messages in a electronic format that can
[1:10:20] be put up onto the message Hub and right
[1:10:23] now they have done over 700 messages
[1:10:27] there were 400 of them that were already
[1:10:29] done but over 700 messages and right now
[1:10:33] every single message that brother
[1:10:35] brandham ever spoke is available for
[1:10:38] somebody that can go into the message
[1:10:40] Hub and they can download it right to
[1:10:42] their
[1:10:43] computer and and the second thing the
[1:10:46] second thing is for the last two weeks
[1:10:49] we have had our young people they
[1:10:50] finished that project and they wanted
[1:10:52] another project so one of our brothers
[1:10:55] he got inspired he said let's go out and
[1:10:57] do some Street witnessing the first week
[1:10:59] they had 10 and they had people in
[1:11:01] church on Sunday Saturday we just got
[1:11:05] the word on on Sunday Saturday there was
[1:11:08] 40 of our young people and some of our
[1:11:11] Elder some of our senior citizens were
[1:11:14] out there with them passing out tracks
[1:11:16] what a spectacle they were on the
[1:11:18] streets of Vancouver with their long
[1:11:20] dresses and their long hair with the
[1:11:23] glory of God on their face passing out
[1:11:25] messages shaking people's hands God
[1:11:28] bless you on I am sure that that that
[1:11:31] Jesus Christ was entertained when he saw
[1:11:34] that taking place in their lives you
[1:11:37] believe that amen I believe the most
[1:11:40] important thing in any life is to
[1:11:42] entertain Jesus properly in first place
[1:11:45] in your worship first place in your life
[1:11:47] first place in Everything Jesus Christ
[1:11:49] deserves that place amen I believe it in
[1:11:52] my heart but if you don't
[1:11:56] he'll take second place yeah he'll go
[1:11:59] down in the basement with you if you're
[1:12:01] ashamed of him when you're out among the
[1:12:03] people and then you go down in the
[1:12:04] basement where nobody will see you he'll
[1:12:07] still come to
[1:12:08] you that ought to make you love him
[1:12:11] above everything else in the worlden
[1:12:13] Jesus in second place Jesus in fourth
[1:12:17] place Jesus in 10th place but still he
[1:12:20] comes to you that's in the unwelcome
[1:12:23] Christ brother Brandon spoke that little
[1:12:25] message in Luzon Switzerland my eye was
[1:12:28] gripped when I read that entertain we
[1:12:31] have the privilege of entertaining the
[1:12:34] Lord Of Glory and so now when God comes
[1:12:38] and he revealed to us he revealed to us
[1:12:40] what happened how Satan deceived those
[1:12:43] angels and then they were cast out of of
[1:12:46] of that compartment and they set up in
[1:12:48] another place and then God knew there
[1:12:50] had to be a battle there had to be a
[1:12:52] place where the battle between right and
[1:12:54] wrong wrong good and evil would be
[1:12:56] fought and it was known of God that that
[1:12:59] place was going to be the mind of man
[1:13:02] every person on earth is fighting a
[1:13:05] battle in their mind right amen that's
[1:13:08] right some people are fighting a battle
[1:13:10] that they can never win right they wake
[1:13:13] up in the morning defeated they go
[1:13:15] through their life defeated and they
[1:13:18] they go to sleep defeated and they will
[1:13:19] go to their grave defeated many of them
[1:13:23] will never have the opportunity one time
[1:13:25] to hear the words that you and I hear
[1:13:28] right we should never ever ever let this
[1:13:31] become common or taking it for granted
[1:13:34] in fact one place brother brandom asked
[1:13:36] a question and again smoke my heart he
[1:13:38] said I wonder are you sufficiently
[1:13:42] impressed yeah with what God has done
[1:13:46] and the word that is among you are you
[1:13:48] sufficiently impressed do you hold the
[1:13:52] word in high esteem do you hold the
[1:13:54] message in high esteem do you do you
[1:13:57] consider that we are the Elite of God by
[1:14:00] the grace of God that he considered us
[1:14:03] he chose us he elected us he called us
[1:14:05] he chose us and by this word we should
[1:14:08] become electrified illuminated
[1:14:11] supercharged quickened we should be
[1:14:14] ready willing and able to go out and
[1:14:16] fight the good fight of Faith all the
[1:14:19] time this message is
[1:14:22] revolutionary and it's evolution AR the
[1:14:25] message continues to evolve in a higher
[1:14:28] plane as you understand you know many
[1:14:31] people they will be hindered in their
[1:14:34] relationship that they can have with the
[1:14:36] Lord Jesus Christ because of their lack
[1:14:39] of Revelation and a lack of Revelation
[1:14:41] become comes because of a lack of
[1:14:44] Consecration and a lack of dedication it
[1:14:47] takes a commitment and a commitment is
[1:14:49] when you eliminate your track doors a
[1:14:52] commitment is when you go and you say
[1:14:54] Lord I'm going to serve you Lord me and
[1:14:57] you are a
[1:14:59] majority so God has introduced us to a
[1:15:02] supernatural civilization he gave us the
[1:15:05] understanding and the revelation of what
[1:15:07] took place between the serpent and
[1:15:10] between Eve and that Cain and Abel were
[1:15:13] twins my what a great and glorious
[1:15:17] understanding I I I know people who have
[1:15:20] the whole Bible memorized one brother
[1:15:22] UPC he witnessed to me about the oness
[1:15:25] of God had the baptism of Jesus name I
[1:15:27] went looking for him because I heard his
[1:15:29] tapes I had never heard any man preach
[1:15:32] like that in my life he preached about
[1:15:34] one God he preached about baptism in
[1:15:36] Jesus name he preached Holiness to a
[1:15:39] height that I had never heard before
[1:15:41] something it seemed to me like it was
[1:15:43] unattainable and I hunted this man down
[1:15:47] and found out where he was going to be
[1:15:48] and I went to a meeting and he spent the
[1:15:50] whole week with me and showed me the
[1:15:53] error of the trinity revealed to me the
[1:15:55] truth about godhead and baptism told me
[1:15:58] the whole story of how Pentecost and the
[1:16:00] Assembly of God had had not been able to
[1:16:03] embrace the Oneness of the godhead and
[1:16:05] baptism in jesus' name and how they had
[1:16:07] separated and then over the years how
[1:16:09] the Assembly of God and all the other
[1:16:11] nazarin and the Church of God their
[1:16:14] standard kept getting lower and lower
[1:16:16] and lower till now they're just like the
[1:16:18] world and I walked into a church and it
[1:16:20] seemed like I had been into a Time Warp
[1:16:23] I I looked at seen people it looked like
[1:16:25] they were like 40 or 50 years behind the
[1:16:28] times there was not one there was not
[1:16:30] one trace of paint on any of the faces
[1:16:33] all had long hair all had long dresses
[1:16:36] uh believe me I was stunned beyond my
[1:16:39] ability to express myself but it was a
[1:16:42] holy awe I said this is the way that
[1:16:45] Christians should be glory and so I
[1:16:49] spent some time in that church and this
[1:16:51] man who introduced me to the UPC took
[1:16:54] him six years he had the whole Bible
[1:16:57] memorized but when somebody witnessed to
[1:17:00] me about the message and God shown that
[1:17:02] light that Supernatural light of
[1:17:04] Revelation that communication system
[1:17:07] began to ring true that that IR THM
[1:17:11] inside of my soul it begin to ring
[1:17:13] that's the truth that's the truth that's
[1:17:15] the truth now who did I want to go back
[1:17:18] to First the brother who had rescued me
[1:17:21] from the Trinity I wanted to go back to
[1:17:25] yeah and I said Brother Bear I said I
[1:17:28] have met I have met a man and uh you
[1:17:30] know I I told you the testimony this is
[1:17:32] the only church I've ever given that
[1:17:34] testimony in but I am I am absolutely
[1:17:38] stunned at how far that test I cannot go
[1:17:41] anywhere and I talk to people all over
[1:17:44] the world and that testimony has found
[1:17:46] its way into countries all over the
[1:17:49] world I don't know how it did it but
[1:17:51] they said brother did that really happen
[1:17:53] that really that guy really do that did
[1:17:55] he really he really get on the bus left
[1:17:58] you in his car he really did that to the
[1:18:00] preacher yeah he sure did well that was
[1:18:02] the preacher that I went back to and
[1:18:04] tried to preach the message to I said

[1:20:46] points us to Enoch he said Enoch walked
[1:20:50] with God and was not that's you
[1:20:55] you are the Enoch of this generation
[1:20:57] each one of us collectively we are the
[1:21:00] Enoch
[1:21:02] generation you are the Abraham and Sarah
[1:21:05] of this generation you're the ones who
[1:21:07] are going to be changed back to young
[1:21:09] again you're going to have a body
[1:21:11] change you you are you are the the
[1:21:14] Rebecca of this day you're the one that
[1:21:16] watered the camel TR you're the one that
[1:21:18] had the Revelation when eler when eler
[1:21:22] came and and he prayed and Rebecca
[1:21:25] walked right into his prayer that was a
[1:21:28] big job people don't realize what a big
[1:21:31] job that was just to water one camel was
[1:21:34] a big job and they didn't have running
[1:21:36] water they had water and they ran to get
[1:21:39] more water and they ran back with the
[1:21:40] water that was their running water and
[1:21:43] she said I'll Water all your camels for
[1:21:46] you I'll give you a drink and take care
[1:21:49] of all your camels and then he knew that
[1:21:52] was the right one and then he went back
[1:21:54] to meet her family Glory right and
[1:21:57] brother Brandon says when when when when
[1:21:59] Ela met Rebecca's family he said he
[1:22:02] never had any problem with her father
[1:22:05] but it was her mother and her brother
[1:22:08] that wanted to stop the progress oh you
[1:22:10] know wait for a little while you know
[1:22:13] but but but elzer he was possessed he
[1:22:16] had to get Rebecca back to Isaac that
[1:22:19] was all he cared about and you know
[1:22:22] after you hear about eler all you hear
[1:22:25] about after that is Isaac and Rebecca
[1:22:30] amen and so brother brandham says now he
[1:22:33] said the the father he said he didn't
[1:22:36] have any problem with him but the mother
[1:22:38] and the brother and he said the mother
[1:22:40] is a type right of the mother church
[1:22:43] right right that wants to pour cold
[1:22:46] water on one of her children if she gets
[1:22:48] a a dose of the Holy Ghost the real Holy
[1:22:51] Ghost and the brother he's type of the
[1:22:55] brother preacher right and somebody gets
[1:22:57] excited goes running back to him tells
[1:22:59] him about serpen SE godhead baptism
[1:23:02] Prophet right away brother preacher and
[1:23:04] mother Church they're going to pour
[1:23:06] water when we have mystery Expos that's
[1:23:08] the last thing I do I don't like to beg
[1:23:11] but I beg these men who have come to the
[1:23:14] mystery Expo I said we're going to give
[1:23:16] you as the Eagles to Earth The Nest
[1:23:17] we're going to give you a church age

[1:23:24] uh these books and we want you to read
[1:23:26] these books we don't give them 70 weeks
[1:23:28] of Daniel or Seal's book until they read
[1:23:31] these these three books first and we beg
[1:23:34] them take these books and and come back
[1:23:37] to the follow-up seminars that they have
[1:23:39] every week I says and and and don't go
[1:23:42] to Mother Church don't go to brother
[1:23:44] preacher you just make a commitment
[1:23:46] between you and God say father I'm
[1:23:48] coming to you I'm coming to you and if
[1:23:52] this message that I have heard and and
[1:23:54] they're all inspired when they come
[1:23:56] because we preach about 30 min sermons
[1:23:59] to them of inspiration and Revelation
[1:24:02] that brother Brandon brought out of the
[1:24:03] Bible that they never saw before and
[1:24:07] they said where is this all coming from
[1:24:08] they've been preaching for many years
[1:24:10] and they've never seen they've never
[1:24:12] seen the three stages of the Rich Young
[1:24:14] Ruler they' never seen the wise and the
[1:24:16] foolish virgin they never seen that King
[1:24:18] Saul was saved all these things that
[1:24:20] brother Brandon brought to light right
[1:24:23] and and and and it quickens them it
[1:24:25] quickens a spark inside of them but if
[1:24:28] they run back and run back to their
[1:24:31] local churches or local PE preachers or
[1:24:34] pastors or friends that they've got
[1:24:35] confidence in it's it's it's a sure sign
[1:24:40] that they're going to have a hard trial
[1:24:43] very very difficult time right and so
[1:24:46] Isaac and Rebecca you you are the
[1:24:49] Rebecca of this age and and and and all
[1:24:51] as you need is Isaac that's all you you
[1:24:54] need you and Isaac married and you have
[1:24:58] been married if you are part of the
[1:24:59] Bride of Jesus Christ at some time in
[1:25:02] your life Jesus Christ has come and he
[1:25:04] has proposed to you supernaturally he
[1:25:07] has said will you become my bride will
[1:25:11] you become Mrs Jesus Christ will you
[1:25:14] accept the wedding band of unmar
[1:25:17] Grace and if you say I do it changes you
[1:25:22] forever it changes your goal it changes
[1:25:25] your focus it changes your priority it
[1:25:28] gives you that mandate a holy
[1:25:30] Supernatural mandate that I am going to
[1:25:34] walk arm in arm with my husband even
[1:25:37] though I can't see him I know he's here
[1:25:39] I know he's with me I know he's in me I
[1:25:42] know he has consumed and possessed and
[1:25:44] absorbed me with his character with his
[1:25:47] life with his
[1:25:49] purpose and then we look at Jacob Jacob
[1:25:52] is our type every one of us was a Jacob
[1:25:55] every one of us had that Jacob nature
[1:25:57] had that Jacob spirit and every one of
[1:26:00] us we had to wrestle with the angel of
[1:26:02] the Lord and and and and Jacob wrestled
[1:26:05] all night long and even at the end of it
[1:26:08] when the angel said light is coming let
[1:26:10] me go and and Jacob said I'm not letting
[1:26:14] you go until you bless me he was still a
[1:26:18] dealmaker he was not I didn't fight all
[1:26:20] night long to walk away from this with
[1:26:22] nothing I want something I want a
[1:26:25] blessing and the angel touched him and
[1:26:28] from that time forward that Shyer that
[1:26:31] little con man that little Wall Street
[1:26:33] kind of a Jew he W the angel touched him
[1:26:36] on his thigh and it shrank and from that
[1:26:39] time on he walked different he he halted
[1:26:42] on his hip like that all the time and
[1:26:44] the people who knew him said you see
[1:26:46] that guy over there he said he said he
[1:26:48] said that used to be Jacob he used to be
[1:26:51] a bad guy he used to be a con man used
[1:26:53] to be used to be somebody that skin your
[1:26:56] Li you never want to do any business
[1:26:58] with him but he he wrestled with the
[1:27:00] angel of the Lord and now he walks
[1:27:03] different and he talks different and he
[1:27:06] lives different and when you have that
[1:27:08] experience every one of us has had to
[1:27:11] have that Common Thread that common
[1:27:13] experience we all Wrestle with the angel
[1:27:16] of the Lord and we can come to a rest
[1:27:19] where brother brandom had a woman
[1:27:21] standing there he said now Sister you
[1:27:22] don't know me I don't know you but there
[1:27:24] is one here who does know you and does
[1:27:26] know me he said now when he and his
[1:27:28] Spirit comes in me and my spirit goes
[1:27:32] away right and he gives me a temporary
[1:27:36] Resurrection in my spirit right and he
[1:27:41] wants to use my body and I'm so happy to
[1:27:44] loan it to him anything he can get out
[1:27:47] of it now when a person can come and
[1:27:50] understand that that when the prophet
[1:27:52] was under the anointed and the Word was
[1:27:55] flowing out of him or when he was in a
[1:27:58] healing line or a discernment line there
[1:28:00] was nothing that could stand between him
[1:28:03] and the people they were totally
[1:28:06] transparent before him because it was
[1:28:08] God who knew that person God knew
[1:28:11] everything they ever did do he knew
[1:28:13] everything they ever will do he knew
[1:28:15] every problem they had right amen and
[1:28:17] often times it wasn't them who had a
[1:28:19] problem it was a brother who had a
[1:28:21] sister it was somebody who was in a
[1:28:23] mental instit stitution it was somebody
[1:28:25] had already had numerous operations and
[1:28:28] he told them about them and and and and
[1:28:31] one one of our brothers at the church he
[1:28:34] went through all the discernment line
[1:28:36] and he put them all on on eight cassette
[1:28:38] tapes that have now been put on to a
[1:28:40] disc and then he went and he and and he
[1:28:43] gleaned a little bit deeper and and he
[1:28:45] put the query in there and your name is
[1:28:50] and he went every time where brother
[1:28:51] Brandon was in a discernment line and he
[1:28:54] called the person out and said and your
[1:28:56] name is he took all of those and he put
[1:28:59] them onto a disc oh my it is so awesome
[1:29:02] just to sit there just to lay in bed at
[1:29:05] night time and just hear that prophet of
[1:29:07] God and you just know it's God it's God
[1:29:10] and it just takes your faith and it
[1:29:12] raises your faith up to a new level many
[1:29:16] people over the years they have been
[1:29:18] healed by the very by the very the very
[1:29:22] ailments that brother Brandon was
[1:29:23] talking about that somebody else had
[1:29:26] right because they said if Jesus Christ
[1:29:28] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:29:31] there's no reason why if he healed them
[1:29:33] that he can't heal
[1:29:35] me we can go a long time in the Joseph
[1:29:38] what a perfect type of Christ Joseph was
[1:29:41] he was loved of his father he was hated
[1:29:43] of his Brethren sold into slavery and
[1:29:47] then and then he was he was elevated to
[1:29:49] Piper's house accused unjustly went into
[1:29:52] jail went into prison but he had a dream
[1:29:55] and the butler was saved and the baker
[1:29:57] was lost and he was raised up to the
[1:29:59] right hand of pharaoh Jesus loved of his
[1:30:02] father hated of his Brethren accused
[1:30:05] unjustly thrown into prison and and and
[1:30:09] then elevated to the right hand right
[1:30:12] hand of God while Joseph was was there
[1:30:15] while Joseph was at the right hand of
[1:30:17] pharaoh he took a gentile bride while
[1:30:20] Jesus was there he has taken himself a
[1:30:23] gentile bride and we are that bride I
[1:30:25] was in Israel with a group of of people
[1:30:29] uh they loved Israel and we had three
[1:30:32] Jewish gods on the bus I was there with
[1:30:34] another brother and each one you know
[1:30:36] got up and said something about their
[1:30:38] experience in Israel and I just said
[1:30:40] have you ever
[1:30:42] considered the parallels the perfect
[1:30:44] parallels between Jesus and Joseph and I
[1:30:48] just gave them exactly the way that
[1:30:49] brother Brenham laid it
[1:30:51] out and and and the denomination brother
[1:30:54] they was sitting there oh that's
[1:30:56] wonderful brother and the Jews were
[1:30:58] sitting there I never heard that before
[1:31:01] yeah I got to study that I got to go
[1:31:04] back to my Rabbi on that one yeah they
[1:31:06] didn't know about
[1:31:08] that the beautiful story of Ruth and
[1:31:10] Boaz you are Ruth friends know when you
[1:31:14] consider when you consider her
[1:31:15] desperation she was a moabitas her her
[1:31:18] family descended from
[1:31:21] incest from incest and they were hated
[1:31:24] by the Jews and yet and and yet they got
[1:31:27] married into a Jewish Family and you
[1:31:29] know and and and and and uh uh Naomi
[1:31:34] never should have left the Homeland
[1:31:36] because Boaz was her near Kinsman he
[1:31:38] never participated in the in the famine
[1:31:41] but IMC and Naomi went out and they took
[1:31:45] themselves for their sons to Moab his
[1:31:48] wife and the father died the two sons
[1:31:51] died and then Naomi left in poverty
[1:31:54] she's got these two moabites she tells
[1:31:56] them go back to your people I'm going
[1:31:58] back to go on the welfare program yeah
[1:32:01] and orer said well Naomi we sure love
[1:32:03] you but see you later she's gone right
[1:32:07] but Ruth said don't don't don't say it
[1:32:10] don't tell me to go wherever you go I'm
[1:32:12] going your God is my God your people are
[1:32:15] my people wherever you go that's where
[1:32:16] I'm going and she came back think about
[1:32:19] it Naomi I mean you know in in shame
[1:32:23] humility ation she comes back broke
[1:32:27] bankrupt she comes back and she's got
[1:32:29] this moabi that she's carrying with her
[1:32:32] y y and the moabites she goes out and
[1:32:35] she shows the character she had seen God
[1:32:38] and her mother-in-law and she went out
[1:32:40] there gleaning doing that backbreaking
[1:32:43] work in the Harvest Sun where the the
[1:32:46] Harvesters had to leave the edges for
[1:32:49] the poor people and they had to get down
[1:32:51] on their knees and they had to go and
[1:32:52] reach over get little barley here little
[1:32:55] barley here and while she's doing that
[1:32:58] the men the men the chief the Chiefs are
[1:33:01] are watching her watching her character
[1:33:03] and then Boaz comes riding on on his
[1:33:06] Chariot and he says who's the Gentile
[1:33:10] and they say oh that that that's Ruth he
[1:33:13] said that's that's your near Kinsman
[1:33:15] remember ALC and Naomi or Al lic's dead
[1:33:18] his son's dead Naomi's come home she's
[1:33:21] broke but she's got this daughter and
[1:33:23] this daughter has worked tirelessly just
[1:33:25] resting just a little
[1:33:27] bit Boaz got the Revelation he said
[1:33:30] bring bring that girl here he said Ruth
[1:33:33] don't go to any more of these
[1:33:34] denominational tables you stay right
[1:33:36] here and he told the men don't you let
[1:33:40] anything happen to her because it was
[1:33:41] dangerous for a moabit to be there you
[1:33:44] because they were hated among the Jewish
[1:33:46] man it was dangerous for her to be there
[1:33:48] don't you let anything happen to her and
[1:33:51] wherever you see her gleaning you go
[1:33:54] ahead of her and you make sure there's
[1:33:56] plenty of barley easily accessible to
[1:33:59] her and so she started picking up the
[1:34:02] godhead and the baptism serpent I'm
[1:34:05] talking about our day that's how God has
[1:34:07] given us handfuls handfuls on purpose
[1:34:11] he's laid it right out before us and
[1:34:14] some of us we don't have the passion to
[1:34:17] eat it to gather it to collect it to
[1:34:20] metabolize it to internalize it and to
[1:34:22] manifest it right amen oh my what a what
[1:34:27] a day you know brother brandom
[1:34:30] says he says uh don't never let your
[1:34:35] testimony be negative let it be positive
[1:34:38] all the time I am
[1:34:40] saved I have God in my heart I believe
[1:34:43] with all my heart you believe in Divine
[1:34:45] Healing with all my heart let your
[1:34:46] testimony always and your thoughts ever
[1:34:48] never permit a negative thought to come
[1:34:51] into your mind if you can help a
[1:34:54] Christian is always positive never
[1:34:57] negative a a a Believer is a seeker of
[1:35:00] Supernatural intelligence and
[1:35:03] intelligence that the FBI and the CIA
[1:35:06] and the TSA the TSA those are the guys
[1:35:08] at the airport you know what you know
[1:35:10] what TSA stands for thousands standing
[1:35:14] around that's what they are we've got a
[1:35:17] little airport in my city and a lot of
[1:35:19] times there's more TSA agents there than
[1:35:22] there are customers there
[1:35:24] and they're looking for somebody to
[1:35:25] torment looking for somebody to search
[1:35:28] looking for somebody to make a hard day
[1:35:30] I feel sorry for some of our senior
[1:35:32] citizens who go there they don't give
[1:35:34] them a place to sit down to take their
[1:35:36] shoes off and and and you know and
[1:35:39] sometimes they got you know they got
[1:35:40] artificial hips and artificial knees and
[1:35:42] ankles and all kind of things and boy
[1:35:45] when that when that Bell goes off when
[1:35:46] that buzzer goes off they think they got
[1:35:48] somebody I got a potential terrorist
[1:35:50] come over here and they get the wand out
[1:35:52] there up your hand put your hands up
[1:35:55] like
[1:35:55] that how many of you ever thought you'd
[1:35:58] ever be subjected to anything like
[1:36:01] that and now they got they got things
[1:36:03] that are even taking away your privacy
[1:36:05] right it's horrible the way it's going
[1:36:08] and so we have revelation we have the
[1:36:12] apocalypse we have the unveiling of God
[1:36:15] in this day right you know all hell is
[1:36:19] against the revelation of this message
[1:36:22] but it's the truth anyways we all have
[1:36:25] to go like brother brandham said we all
[1:36:27] have to go through the Hall of critics
[1:36:29] and shame before we go to the Hall of
[1:36:32] Fame as a masterpiece we are acting out
[1:36:35] a supernatural drama every day in in in
[1:36:39] our lives you know when I was I was
[1:36:42] coming back from a a trip one day just
[1:36:44] closing right now I know it's a
[1:36:46] Wednesday night and many of you have to
[1:36:47] drive and work tomorrow but I was coming
[1:36:50] back from a trip and uh I I just started
[1:36:54] writing on a on a pad and I just started
[1:36:57] thinking of all the
[1:36:59] Magnificent Revelations and
[1:37:01] understandings and illuminations that
[1:37:04] God has given to me and I just started
[1:37:06] writing them down if a prophet had not
[1:37:08] come and with this I close if a prophet
[1:37:10] had not come how would you and I have
[1:37:13] ever
[1:37:14] known that Noah preached for 120 years
[1:37:20] and that it never rained one time right
[1:37:23] nobody knows that outside of the message
[1:37:27] it took after the fact Revelation you
[1:37:29] know a prophet is like a submarine that
[1:37:32] submarine has got a periscope well a
[1:37:34] prophet he's like a prophet scope and
[1:37:37] when God wants to lift him up and God
[1:37:39] wants to turn him back and take him back
[1:37:41] 6,000 years and tell us what Eve looked
[1:37:44] like the most beautiful woman in the
[1:37:46] world tell us what the serpant look like
[1:37:48] great big prehistoric giant you know
[1:37:51] this is a privilege that God gives to us
[1:37:53] to illuminate our minds to understand
[1:37:57] who we are and what God is and where
[1:37:59] we're
[1:38:00] going how could you have ever known that
[1:38:03] Abraham and Sarah were going to be
[1:38:05] changed back to a young man and a young
[1:38:07] woman again but when you see it it's
[1:38:09] right there in the Bible when we do the
[1:38:11] mystery Expo they say oh I never saw
[1:38:14] that before wow that's a good one y and
[1:38:17] they think they got one little truth but
[1:38:19] then they start coming coming coming
[1:38:21] coming you know how would you know that
[1:38:23] King Saul was saved if there was one guy
[1:38:26] in the Bible I never thought I'd going
[1:38:27] to see in heaven it was King
[1:38:29] Saul he disobeyed God he tried to kill
[1:38:32] David over and over and over and over he
[1:38:35] went to the witch of Endor which he
[1:38:37] himself said was a crime worthy of death
[1:38:39] called up Samuel Samuel said why have
[1:38:41] you called me from see you become the
[1:38:44] enemy of God that's right Saul says the
[1:38:47] spirit of God has left me yeah you a
[1:38:50] prophet says you're the enemy of God
[1:38:53] Saul says the spirit of God's left me
[1:38:55] and Samuel and he says I want to know
[1:38:57] what's going to happen in the battle he
[1:38:58] said you and your sons will fall in
[1:38:59] battle and tomorrow you will be with me
[1:39:03] prophet of God said don't you put Saul
[1:39:05] in hell he was backsliding but don't you
[1:39:08] put him in Hell amen wow Glory what a
[1:39:11] truth how would you have known the Rich
[1:39:13] Young ruler's ultimate end was hell and
[1:39:16] the three stages that he went through
[1:39:18] before he got there how would you have
[1:39:20] known that hell was not Eternal right
[1:39:23] how could we have ever known the truth
[1:39:25] about baptism and godhead the truth
[1:39:27] about the Rapture and the changing how
[1:39:30] it's going to take place how would we
[1:39:32] know who the two witnesses were and the
[1:39:35] 144,000 and the souls under the altar my
[1:39:39] when these things started to come come
[1:39:41] open up to me it was like it was like a
[1:39:43] panorama it was like the best it was
[1:39:46] like the best movie I ever saw in my
[1:39:48] life and I was seeing it in the womb of
[1:39:50] my mind God was prating my mind
[1:39:53] with Seven Seals he was literally
[1:39:56] unsealing himself Night by Night himself
[1:40:01] not brother brandham brother brandham
[1:40:03] didn't reveal the Seven Seals it was
[1:40:05] Jesus Christ who revealed himself to the
[1:40:08] prophet of God through the office of
[1:40:10] that Prophet how can we have known the
[1:40:12] Seven Seals the serpent seed the how we
[1:40:15] measure the future home of the Heavenly
[1:40:17] bridegroom the Antichrist was already
[1:40:19] working in Paul's day the world's
[1:40:22] looking for the anti Christ and the
[1:40:23] false prophet and the Beast we know
[1:40:25] they're all one and the same just three
[1:40:27] stages like God had three stages father
[1:40:30] son Holy Ghost same thing with the
[1:40:33] devil how could we have known who the
[1:40:35] the the great and the Harlot and
[1:40:37] the number the mark the image the name
[1:40:39] of the Beast the seven

[1:40:46] USA who brought fire from heaven with a
[1:40:49] nuclear bomb brother BR that was America
[1:40:53] y how could we have ever known the truth
[1:40:55] about
[1:40:57] 666 you know that one really rattles
[1:40:59] people especially in the Philippines
[1:41:01] because the Philippines is so Catholic
[1:41:03] and many of these preachers we're
[1:41:04] preaching to have come out of
[1:41:06] Catholicism and they still have family
[1:41:09] and Catholicism and it ignites them when
[1:41:11] they find out that their PE that they
[1:41:14] just thought they had come out of
[1:41:16] Catholicism to something better but they
[1:41:18] had no idea now their family is trapped
[1:41:20] in the Beast
[1:41:22] system how could we have ever known the
[1:41:24] truth because there great conflict
[1:41:26] sometimes even within the Ws of the
[1:41:28] message about the tribulation period is
[1:41:30] it 3 and A2 years is it seven years how
[1:41:33] could we have known about adoption and
[1:41:35] predestination statute of a perfect man

[1:41:42] zeden God of this evil age Jezebel
[1:41:44] religion doing God a servant without it
[1:41:46] being his will how could we have
[1:41:49] understand how God moves supernaturally
[1:41:51] in the life of a people and how could we
[1:41:53] have ever understood or even known about
[1:41:56] the third pull all these wonderful
[1:41:59] things you know brother Brandon just in
[1:42:01] closing this brother brandom says you
[1:42:04] know there there was there was a great
[1:42:05] controversy about the Seven Seals yeah
[1:42:10] and I have my own opinion brother
[1:42:12] brandom said the Seven Seals is not open
[1:42:16] y to the
[1:42:19] public but it is open right to the
[1:42:22] private right
[1:42:24] Guardianship and the Bride of Jesus
[1:42:26] Christ it is open to us and I think it's
[1:42:30] the most wonderful thing that God could
[1:42:32] ever do is to unveil himself to give us
[1:42:36] rapturing Faith that's right exactly
[1:42:40] brother random says a rejected King
[1:42:41] let's stand to her feet he said a
[1:42:43] rejected King he says oh my precious
[1:42:45] friend my beloved my darlings of the
[1:42:47] Gospel my begotten children of God
[1:42:49] listen to me your pastor I I wish there
[1:42:52] was some way I could explain it to you
[1:42:54] but there's no words I couldn't find it
[1:42:56] it's not found anywhere but just beyond
[1:42:58] this last breath is the most glorious
[1:43:01] thing that you ever there is no way to
[1:43:04] explain it there's no way I just can't
[1:43:06] do it but whatever you do and this is a
[1:43:10] thought that I would like to leave this
[1:43:12] to you with with with with a love that
[1:43:14] is pulsating in my heart to you my
[1:43:17] brothers my sisters to the Bride of

[1:43:31] you can love everybody every enemy
[1:43:35] everything else that one visit there has
[1:43:38] made me a different man I can never
[1:43:43] never never be the same brother Brandon
[1:43:47] that I was after all the things that he
[1:43:50] saw after all the the Realms and the
[1:43:53] dimensions that God had taken him to all
[1:43:56] the things that he saw all the
[1:43:58] miraculous the hundreds of thousands in
[1:44:01] India the blind man healed the the the
[1:44:05] dead raised back to life again but but

[1:44:19] said whatever you do friends lay aside
[1:44:24] everything
[1:44:26] right make it a priority get perfect
[1:44:31] love the message came to take the fear
[1:44:34] off the people the message came to take
[1:44:37] the complexes off the people when you
[1:44:39] get rid of your fear and you get rid of
[1:44:41] your complexes and you fall in love with
[1:44:44] Jesus Christ you fall in love with

[1:47:14] beauty but yet Lord we desire the beauty
[1:47:17] of your Holiness it's only one thing
[1:47:20] greater than happiness and that's
[1:47:21] holiness and Lord by your by Your Word

[1:47:29] your blood by your sacrifice at Calvary
[1:47:33] Lord you you you took the beating you
[1:47:36] took the bruising no man was ever marred
[1:47:38] like you were marred and while you were
[1:47:40] on that cross we are on your
[1:47:43] mind and Lord you had a plan and the
[1:47:46] plan was going to start shortly after
[1:47:48] your Resurrection father when you
[1:47:51] abducted
[1:47:52] Saul and he became Paul and you took the
[1:47:56] 120 and put them in the upper room and
[1:47:59] they came down speaking with tongues and
[1:48:02] every man heard them in their own
[1:48:05] language and they went and they turned
[1:48:07] the world upside down father and we see
[1:48:10] seven Church ages came to pass and then
[1:48:14] we saw the seventh angel that was in
[1:48:16] your hand you swed him into the world he
[1:48:19] was the one that was going to bring the
[1:48:21] culmination of all all truth to a bride
[1:48:25] that was going to emerge in the most
[1:48:27] wicked the most deceptive the most
[1:48:30] deceiving the most perverted generation
[1:48:34] that man has ever known and yet this
[1:48:37] bride was going to shine in all of your
[1:48:41] beauty
[1:48:42] father Lord I pray if there'd be one
[1:48:45] here tonight who has never surrendered
[1:48:47] thems totally to
[1:48:49] you Lord we know that time is short
[1:48:53] we know the Rapture is right around the
[1:48:55] corner yes we know the cup of iniquity
[1:48:58] is just about full be ready to overflow
[1:49:03] soon Lord we wouldn't want one to have
[1:49:07] to miss the Rapture to go in a
[1:49:10] tribulation I'd like to just ask you
[1:49:13] Lord if there's one here that you want
[1:49:16] to speak to tonight and they want to

[1:50:59] will will be done in their lives that if
