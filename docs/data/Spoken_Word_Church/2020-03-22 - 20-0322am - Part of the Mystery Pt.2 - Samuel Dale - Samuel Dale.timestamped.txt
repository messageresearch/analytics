[3:19] verse 21 submitting yourselves one to
[3:23] another in the fear of God while submit
[3:25] yourselves unto your own husband's as
[3:27] unto the Lord hey we're having to speak
[3:30] to them out there you just think oh you
[3:33] know we'd say we want to today because
[3:37] the sisters are at home viewing in but
[3:39] just remember they can get their day
[3:41] back so you know all right
[3:46] why submit yourselves unto your own
[3:48] husband's as unto the Lord for the
[3:51] husband is the head of the wife even as
[3:53] Christ is the head of the church and
[3:54] he's the savior of the body therefore as
[3:58] the church is subject unto Christ so let
[4:01] the wives be to their own husband's in
[4:03] everything
[4:05] husbands now coming down to us that are
[4:08] here what love your wives even as Christ
[4:11] also loved the church and gave himself
[4:14] art that he might sanctify and cleanse
[4:18] it with the washing of the water of the
[4:20] word that he might present it to himself
[4:22] a glorious church
[4:24] now remember what he's doing and that's
[4:26] what he's gonna say here a minute he's
[4:27] describing husband and wife but he's
[4:31] really speaking of Christ in the church
[4:33] all right we all know one familiar with
[4:36] that but I want you to get this part see
[4:38] that he might sanctify and cleanse
[4:39] with a washing of the water by the word
[4:41] they might present it to himself a
[4:43] glorious church not having spot or
[4:46] wrinkle or any such thing that it it
[4:49] should be holy and without blemish so
[4:51] ought men to love your wives as their
[4:54] own bodies he that loveth his wife
[4:56] loveth himself for no man ever yet hated
[5:00] his own flesh but nourishes in churches
[5:04] even as the Lord the church
[5:06] where we are members of his body and of
[5:09] his flesh and of his bones for this
[5:13] cause shall a man leave his father and
[5:15] mother and she'll be joined unto his
[5:17] wife and they too shall be one flesh
[5:19] this is a great mystery but I speak
[5:24] concerning Christ in the church he's
[5:28] he's he's typing it but he's speaking of
[5:31] Christ in the church all right what is
[5:34] it this is a great mystery all right
[5:38] nevertheless but every one of you in
[5:40] particular so love his wife even as
[5:42] himself and the wife see that she
[5:43] reverence her husband you may be seated
[5:45] at the Lord at his blessing to the
[5:47] reading of the word now as I said we
[5:51] want to try to cover back and because
[5:58] we've been off services from the
[5:59] different things but I want to kind of
[6:02] tie in the thought back to a couple of
[6:06] two or three weeks ago when we were
[6:08] ministering the clothes see Paul is
[6:11] saying here that he's describing a
[6:14] husband and a wife and their
[6:16] relationship and and their life together
[6:18] and their things and how it should be
[6:20] and he said now I'm speaking of Christ
[6:24] in the church all right I'm bringing it
[6:27] down to Christ in the church and and
[6:30] it's the mystery so I remember the life
[6:33] thought we were bringing that there's a
[6:38] mystery involved in this that's more
[6:41] than just I was trying to express then
[6:44] that you know it is true in the Bible
[6:49] that there's a mystery there of the
[6:51] engrafting of the Gentiles
[6:53] all right them coming in that's a
[6:55] mystery that was not known in the Old
[6:57] Testament even though the people could
[6:59] read they couldn't know it couldn't see
[7:02] it correctly but once it starts
[7:04] unveiling then no that's my whole point
[7:09] once it started unveiling when you come
[7:12] in to Jesus Christ and the crucifixion
[7:15] you know and the different thing and
[7:17] then the life coming and then here you
[7:20] come
[7:20] with the Apostle Paul picking up the Old
[7:24] Testament to express from that Old
[7:27] Testament what is taking place actually
[7:30] there in the book of Acts and during
[7:32] that period of time and all of the
[7:33] things and he's describing Christ in the
[7:37] church as a mystery he knew of the
[7:40] engrafting of the gentiles paul knew of
[7:44] that spoke of it in the scriptures there
[7:46] and in describing it that there was a
[7:48] great mystery there that was not known
[7:51] as I said down through the Old Testament
[7:54] but once it was Prague you know begin to
[7:57] be revealed through Jesus Christ and
[7:59] then their disciples and then Peter turn
[8:01] doing the call turning to the to the
[8:04] Gentiles and Peter going on to the Jews
[8:06] that was not a division in the basis of
[8:10] of troubles and problems
[8:13] it was just a separation in the basis
[8:16] that it would bring Paul to - you know
[8:19] this is where I said it would bring Paul
[8:21] out in the open who would say it he
[8:23] would he would raise up because he would
[8:27] see you know he's seen the mystery he
[8:29] could look back he had that Old
[8:31] Testament background he had that studies
[8:34] of the scriptures and things that he had
[8:36] done all right then all it took was just
[8:38] a few little clicks as we call it a few
[8:41] little points hid in his mind and first
[8:44] thing you know he's covering the whole
[8:46] Old Testament then he can look back in
[8:48] the sea and he can see that Abraham that
[8:51] Abraham was a Gentile see because you
[8:54] didn't have that you didn't have the
[8:56] word Jew till you come over about the
[8:57] second two seconds Kings I believe it is
[9:01] where he comes into the tribe of Judah
[9:04] all right and you know then you wouldn't
[9:07] have a description of dividing between
[9:09] Jew and Gentile but they just wouldn't
[9:11] know Gentile back the Old Testament put
[9:14] in front of the line now you have little
[9:16] points you have Rahab the harlot you
[9:19] have the different things that happens
[9:20] in that and akka said you have them
[9:23] looking back and as Paul looks back and
[9:25] sees that he says are some history
[9:28] already he describes the mystery that
[9:31] the engrafting of the Gentiles was a
[9:33] great mission
[9:33] well I like that because see that's what
[9:37] we are we're the Gentiles I like our
[9:39] part of knowing that we are in the
[9:41] scriptures and we spoke of back there
[9:44] but yet it had to wait until do and
[9:48] really come in a complete point it would
[9:51] have to wait until the end time to come
[9:54] forth to fully understand the Gentiles
[9:57] you know all brought it out and
[10:00] described it at all but yet in the end
[10:02] times when the Prophet came to bring the
[10:05] message then we could begin to see that
[10:08] the situation that existed of the
[10:11] Gentiles coming in to a certain position
[10:13] and what I mean by that certain position
[10:16] is what I tried to explain then that see
[10:21] when when Paul as I said bring in that
[10:25] Gentile dispensation he could describe
[10:28] that he could you know or say this about
[10:32] it and speak to us of the mysterious
[10:34] part but still they were something left
[10:37] for the end time that this prophet would
[10:41] pick it up and bring it in to and show
[10:45] then and bring in the bride and bring in
[10:48] then you can look at all those tops and
[10:50] shadows now you can look at all the Old
[10:52] Testament you can compare it with a New
[10:54] Testament you can see the Gentiles
[10:56] coming in and you see those things do it
[10:58] but remember the Gentiles were not
[11:00] coming in until it comes to a certain
[11:02] spot even though you begin followed the
[11:08] point you begin the the day of Pentecost
[11:11] and the baptism with the Holy Ghost
[11:13] coming forth and all but those were Jews
[11:16] all right even into the book of Acts the
[11:20] Prophet said those were basically Jews
[11:23] will maybe just a little
[11:25] hearing younger of a few Gentiles in and
[11:28] brought in why because it was still a
[11:30] mystery
[11:31] all right so Paul picks that up and he
[11:35] brings it out and begins to describe the
[11:38] mystery
[11:40] alright then holding that mystery would
[11:43] be then as that would be you know we
[11:46] followed it like I've always told you we
[11:49] Baptist we preach to the Gentiles being
[11:51] and grafted in we preached adoptions we
[11:55] preached things like that some of those
[11:56] people back there had pretty decent
[11:59] understanding you could read Scofield's
[12:01] writings you could you know you could
[12:03] bring in the different things and and
[12:05] have a pretty good understanding but you
[12:08] wouldn't receive the real thing now
[12:10] here's the real thing that I've come up
[12:12] to it now so we're gonna drop the bomb
[12:14] shield and then backed up okay see to me
[12:16] of what I'm trying to describe the
[12:18] mystery of the engrafting of the
[12:20] Gentiles is not just an engrafting of
[12:23] Gentiles thing but it is coming to a
[12:27] point that as we've read from Paul
[12:29] saying I'm speaking concerning Christ in
[12:33] the church all right
[12:35] showing that the church right now what
[12:40] was our lifestyle says we were on
[12:41] through the message a couple of two or
[12:43] three weeks ago
[12:44] see the bride is part of the mystery
[12:48] alright now we can follow that we can
[12:52] comprehend it thing and get our thoughts
[12:56] onto that but just remember the bride is
[12:59] part of the mystery all right now here's
[13:01] the thing to be is the mystery of it all
[13:04] though you over the book of Revelation
[13:06] and it says you know that they were that
[13:08] they would be a mystery there in about
[13:11] the tenth chapter and it would come down
[13:13] to the mystery the mystery singular what
[13:17] is the mystery singular that the bride
[13:20] of Jesus Christ Jew Gentile whatever to
[13:25] make up we are because it come into that
[13:27] through Christ is to the point that we
[13:31] are the thing that has to finish this
[13:34] all up
[13:35] alright then finishing it up then the
[13:38] mystery the mystery is that he's going
[13:42] to reveal you now get that point and
[13:46] then we'll back up into and you'll see
[13:48] the day that we're living and what the
[13:50] Prophet tried to do and hopefully but
[13:52] see the mystery to me
[13:55] is all of those things Gentiles coming
[13:58] in all those things happening but each
[14:01] one of them left just a little bit of
[14:04] understanding the great Apostle Paul
[14:07] could bring that mystery in and he could
[14:10] could bring it in to the Gentile
[14:12] dispensation but yet he could not see
[14:15] the finishing up because he didn't know
[14:17] the seals he didn't know those things
[14:19] that would be later to come on see that
[14:22] would be part of the mystery because to
[14:26] me it takes the seals to open to reveal
[14:28] the mystery that's the mystery I'm
[14:30] talking about
[14:31] if those seals opening brings the
[14:34] revelation of Jesus Christ to a complete
[14:38] revelation fullness bringing it up to
[14:42] all finish it up and will bring a
[14:45] rapture we'll do those sign because it's
[14:48] the mystery of Jesus Christ all right
[14:51] but the great mystery is the seals the
[14:54] following the seals not only revealed
[14:56] Jesus Christ you know you know I'm sorry
[15:01] for saying it in the wrong way but
[15:04] seemingly to me the people of the
[15:05] message they can get Jesus Christ out of
[15:08] the seals they can talk about those
[15:10] things but they never bring it back to
[15:12] the results you know I swear I think
[15:16] they're missing the mystery I don't want
[15:19] us to miss it I've tried my best to
[15:21] appreciate for 40 years that the mystery
[15:24] is the engrafting are bringing into
[15:28] existence the real mystery that all of
[15:32] that typed and said in motion and
[15:35] brought into order and as it brings into
[15:38] order now in the last days through the
[15:39] opening of the seals we see the bride
[15:41] across see the seals don't this route
[15:45] follow me now don't mean I don't mean
[15:47] they don't reveal the seals is not to
[15:50] just say the revelation of Jesus Christ
[15:52] as the person as the the you know the
[15:57] the one true and living God all of that
[15:59] star but it goes into the greater in
[16:02] this street
[16:04] which would bring in the bride of Jesus
[16:06] Christ then it would bring and show who
[16:11] we are what we're doing what we're doing
[16:14] here we're here to finish this up all
[16:19] right and there's no listen if she is
[16:21] part of the mystery we'll read it in a
[16:23] minute from cross the mystery if she is
[16:26] part of the mystery then she's got to be
[16:28] revealed that's that's all that I've
[16:31] ever tried to say it doesn't mean that
[16:33] we will be revealed it doesn't mean that
[16:35] you will be made known all right that's
[16:38] good but it means you've got to be made
[16:41] known you are the finishing up of all
[16:44] things the bride of Jesus Christ
[16:47] finishes this whole mystery all that's
[16:50] throughout the Bible ends in summing up
[16:54] into a group of people who will take the
[16:58] Word of God hold that word declare it to
[17:04] be there but to see that she's that part
[17:07] now that's what I said a minute ago now
[17:10] see the people can handle maybe Jesus in
[17:13] the seals or our Jesus Christ in the
[17:15] seals are or they're seeing the Godhead
[17:17] and in a different thing but what about
[17:20] seeing the Godhead in the correct order
[17:25] what about seeing it as we'll read in a
[17:28] minute we get to if you don't well quote
[17:30] them we've got them here then the bride
[17:33] being part of the mystery
[17:36] you know then he's not complete brother
[17:38] branham said without you know we say no
[17:44] no we're not complete no see that's
[17:46] right that's alright we know that we
[17:49] were - no we're not we're nothing but
[17:52] the thing of it is is she's part of the
[17:54] mystery then she's got to be revealed
[17:58] and when she's revealed it's revealed
[18:02] that tor the Prophet says it so
[18:06] drastically that he are the Godhead is
[18:09] not complete without you all right that
[18:15] should be the thing that is prevalent
[18:18] into all of our minds is the thinking of
[18:20] how much he thinks of me and you that he
[18:25] thinks enough to put within us all of
[18:29] the word the message the seals the thing
[18:31] and bring it out to reveal yes Jesus
[18:37] being the Christ but to reveal where
[18:40] he's at and what he's doing see now if
[18:45] Paul is correct saying it kind of way we
[18:50] know he is but if Paul is correct that
[18:53] he's speaking of Christ in the church
[18:56] but describing it as a husband-and-wife
[19:00] situation and bringing it down even to
[19:03] from more than just being a husband wife
[19:06] but being so much that we're bone of his
[19:08] bone and flesh of his flesh he's going
[19:12] all the way back to the Old Testament
[19:13] bringing it all the way down and laying
[19:16] it down within to her that you and I are
[19:18] at the mystery then can you read the
[19:24] seal book and see the Bride of Christ
[19:27] come on you got your line your ups your
[19:31] man in the Eagle now we know Jesus
[19:36] Christ is be revealed but get the point
[19:38] of what I'm trying to emphasize to us
[19:40] we're in the day when all things is to
[19:43] be made known all right we look out here
[19:47] in the world not to say much about that
[19:48] because that's nothing to us
[19:50] I don't even that doesn't enter this
[19:52] situation but to see the world was
[19:55] pitiful horrible way it's going but yet
[19:58] to say that we could stand back 40 50
[20:01] years ago and here in a profit now a lot
[20:04] of the people that are listening today
[20:06] hurt literally said under the ministry
[20:10] of the profit literally so and were
[20:13] there when the Dead was raised the sick
[20:15] was healed and the things that happened
[20:17] all right then you can associate with
[20:19] the fact of brother Branham saying that
[20:22] the Ministry of Jesus Christ is back
[20:24] exactly like it was when Jesus walked
[20:27] the shores of Galilee all right but now
[20:32] let's don't stop there
[20:34] see you can come up to a point and
[20:36] cabbies down on something and fail to
[20:39] really move on in all things so then
[20:43] where is it being tied together my point
[20:47] worth
[20:48] if we are the brought across then the
[20:53] Bride of Christ is flexed with his flesh
[20:55] and bone of his bone and he's now
[21:01] revealing her brother branham was part
[21:07] of the Bride of Christ come on right we
[21:09] look at it in a way I preached hard
[21:12] sometimes people back up from that
[21:15] brother Branham was part of the Bride of
[21:17] Christ he was a member of the Bride of
[21:20] Christ he was a born again believer sure
[21:24] he was a prophet he was all of those but
[21:27] he was also under way I love everything
[21:30] all the way you said he said I said that
[21:32] New Testament preacher he said he's just
[21:34] he said he's just a preacher said you
[21:36] know prophet said he's just a preacher
[21:39] well he ain't belittling it he's putting
[21:45] it in the correct order but it sounds
[21:48] like he's belittling the ministry no
[21:51] he's describing the ministry and he was
[21:53] constantly I'll give me these over and
[21:55] over constantly referring to the
[21:59] ministry of Jesus Christ would have to
[22:01] be here well that's what I said back
[22:03] there that's what I've always said
[22:05] we can look at brother Branham amen we
[22:08] see the ministry of Jesus Christ
[22:11] repeat maybe some of us didn't see him
[22:14] physically but we see him by way of the
[22:17] tapes the the things you know and we see
[22:21] him that God was using him to bring the
[22:26] same ministry that the Lord Jesus Christ
[22:29] had all right now the Lord Jesus Christ
[22:34] went on beyond Paul and him right
[22:36] because the Lord Jesus in Matthew 24
[22:38] priests wat the seals right see then
[22:44] Paul and him never could understand what
[22:45] he was saying but they knew that he was
[22:48] bringing something but see now you and I
[22:52] by what we see to me the something that
[22:56] he was bringing
[22:58] the something that the Lord Jesus was
[23:00] bringing throughout the Old Testament
[23:02] something that God was bringing into
[23:04] view was to try to get the people to
[23:07] realize who they are that to me is the
[23:13] whole goal of all of it that to me is
[23:15] the greatest mystery that could be you
[23:17] say this mystery of Chris this mystery
[23:19] that ole Anderson now the mystery of
[23:21] what who we are who we are and the
[23:29] purpose of being here the Prophet said
[23:34] it he said when the bride begins to say
[23:36] I and my father are one
[23:39] what's him and these other things I like
[23:41] that one
[23:43] he said to shucks we'll pull away
[23:47] we'll see you want to see this shirt
[23:49] pull away get into the word oh well
[23:53] we're told that's where I loved the
[23:55] title of the prophets away he titled
[23:57] signs you see I remember when that was
[24:00] first we had to you know we started
[24:02] getting a few of the types back in the
[24:04] sixties are you know in doing where he
[24:07] would bring out you know like seeds
[24:09] shall not be heir with a shock well I
[24:13] remember thinking I don't know if I
[24:19] preached that message I'd say that shook
[24:21] does not air with a seed you know
[24:26] but I got to thinking about what he's
[24:28] saying the seeds shall not be heir with
[24:31] the show the shucks is going to the
[24:33] ground the shuck is going to the
[24:35] tribulation the bride's not going so the
[24:38] bride's not going to be that seed is not
[24:40] gonna be heir with the shucks it's the
[24:43] shot that pulls away it's not the seed
[24:46] the shucks pulls away to unveil the seed
[24:49] that's why I asked you to to read the
[24:53] mighty guard unveiled and then our the
[24:55] unveiling of God and then the mighty God
[24:56] unveiled and we'll try to get in to a
[24:58] few things and maybe pick up something
[25:00] in into the seat shield on the air with
[25:04] a sugar on like that you know the
[25:05] manifest masterpiece the different ones
[25:11] because my goal is my thoughts is like I
[25:14] said a person asked me brother Russ
[25:17] Duncan asked me the other day said work
[25:19] words you're thinking what are you what
[25:22] are you thinking you know what do you
[25:23] your your what is your sayings you know
[25:28] what are you bringing right now I said
[25:30] one thing for certain
[25:33] I believe in things being positive so
[25:38] right now the now listen to the wording
[25:42] and listen correctly the Ministry of
[25:45] Jesus Christ was back there right but
[25:51] not on the way it
[25:53] come forth when he walked on earth it
[25:58] begin to unfold what he was coming to do
[26:01] all right what was he coming to do oh he
[26:06] was coming to preach this precept well
[26:11] if the bride is part of the mystery come
[26:17] on shirts if the bride is part of the
[26:19] mystery she's got to be revealed he that
[26:22] if she maybe she's got to be revealed
[26:26] know I'm looking for Jesus Christ
[26:29] well you don't understand what I'm
[26:31] saying that's what I'm looking for but
[26:33] I'm looking for him in feminist form I'm
[26:38] looking for him in the Christ I'm
[26:41] looking for him into the point of who he
[26:46] is really one with he just think it just
[26:52] started on the day of Pentecost it's the
[26:56] end here but to end and what to end in
[27:01] me and you alright so the Prophet would
[27:06] constantly say we have the same ministry
[27:12] that Jesus Christ had when our people
[27:17] can take it and I've even went to
[27:19] Forrester's try to say it you can say
[27:21] well that was in brother Branham that's
[27:23] good because that was where it was that
[27:25] it was dire but now take what was dire
[27:28] and put it what is here now me now
[27:33] you're coming to her that this God's
[27:35] going to pull away when you begin to say
[27:37] I and my father are one
[27:40] what did they do to the Lord when he
[27:42] declared I and my father one they
[27:44] crucified Him what do you think their
[27:46] spawn
[27:46] gonna try to do to you when you're
[27:48] telling them you're his bride and that
[27:51] they are declaring are manifesting to
[27:57] the point of sure that they're not the
[28:00] bride they're the sharpness pulling away
[28:04] and that's the danger stage C is like
[28:08] waves preaching on sanctification you
[28:10] know and some like it that's the danger
[28:12] part it's for us to come to a place that
[28:17] we can talk about something being real
[28:20] to us but it not being reality there's
[28:24] the danger right C will not declare and
[28:29] I've always have up I'll always tried to
[28:31] preach it for forty years at least that
[28:34] the bride of Jesus Christ would be the
[28:39] Word made flesh the first sermon I
[28:43] preached in 1969 was what the bride of
[28:48] Jesus Christ is the son of man I believe
[28:53] that how much is more do you think I
[28:54] believe it today than I did then but we
[28:56] only had a few things to go fried rice
[28:58] we had a few books few types we didn't
[29:02] have anything to to declare you know and
[29:04] I had to speak it just from my own point
[29:07] a lot of it and you all have seen it
[29:09] with the people in the church and you
[29:11] know they would you know
[29:11] I mean look brother branham was not see
[29:15] their their thoughts brother branham's D
[29:17] son of man we've had brother branham now
[29:20] you talk to the faithful of the messages
[29:22] especially the the some of the older
[29:25] returns in a different thing they're
[29:27] going to do choir we've had this we've
[29:29] had that okay
[29:32] I go along with it we've had it but we
[29:36] didn't house the completion if you go
[29:40] along with me that the Old Testament
[29:44] never brought forth Jesus Christ in a
[29:48] complete fullness until the day of
[29:51] Pentecost you know it had to come to
[29:52] pinnacle it couldn't just be in the Old
[29:54] Testament if you go with me I'll go with
[29:58] you on the other see that's worth yeah
[29:59] but to me see that's something that's a
[30:02] mystery and I remember the first time
[30:07] after coming into the message I remember
[30:10] listening to a tape and and you know and
[30:13] just thinking this man you've heard me
[30:18] tell it I was looking for something
[30:21] positive and here comes a man talking
[30:24] about the God that I've seen when I was
[30:27] 10 to 11 years old
[30:29] that's not exalted to tell that it's
[30:31] just telling the truth which me it
[30:34] didn't stop there had it stopped there
[30:37] it wouldn't have been truth it would
[30:39] have been part truth if we get the
[30:43] mystery of Christ has been into being
[30:45] and find it to where we can bring it in
[30:48] to the bride now we're getting to the
[30:50] place that we can walk on what we're
[30:52] talking about now we're not concerned
[30:55] with what the world was doing and what's
[30:57] taking place we're concerned as human
[30:59] beings about the sicknesses and the
[31:01] things like that but these other things
[31:03] there's just part of what's got to be I
[31:06] mean they're doing the best they can do
[31:08] you see yeah but they're shutting down
[31:09] these big companies well they're doing
[31:11] the best they can do to try to get rid
[31:13] of that flu bugs or whatever you call it
[31:20] but you understand what I'm sayin if the
[31:22] bride is part of the mystery what is it
[31:26] to be revealed what is to be revealed
[31:29] you sorta bride-to-be reveal okay we got
[31:32] that now but who's the bride if he was
[31:41] the son of man right if Jesus Christ was
[31:48] the son of man and we would declare he
[31:51] was right
[31:53] all right then worse the flex of his
[31:55] flesh and bone of his bone see that's
[31:59] got to be in Bride form that's put my
[32:02] point the mystery that weird and it's
[32:05] supposed to be dealing with in our day
[32:07] in town of whatever we're here is God in
[32:12] bride form well you have a brother there
[32:17] that's just a little bit no it's not
[32:19] enough that's what I'm trying to get you
[32:22] to see this because if you take it it's
[32:24] the title of the sermon brother Branham
[32:27] in Jeffersonville Indiana preached the
[32:29] unveiling of God and you read that and
[32:35] you listen to it
[32:36] he put his whole emphases very little is
[32:38] said about the bride or anything
[32:41] his whole emphasis is based upon the
[32:45] unveiling of God then he turns and goes
[32:52] to Philadelphia I think it is I forgot
[32:54] work but just shortly thereafter he
[32:56] preached a message called the mighty God
[32:59] unveiled now read that message and look
[33:04] into it and you'll find that he spent
[33:08] not as much time describing the one god
[33:11] of this being you know not being free
[33:14] and not being there and not being that
[33:16] and ever you know and describing as he
[33:18] did in the unveiling
[33:19] now he's describing something else why
[33:23] were that Godwin
[33:29] the mighty God unveiled the showing
[33:36] where he went where did he go on the day
[33:39] of Pentecost he come right back down
[33:41] into the bride and begins to declare
[33:46] those signs and see that's what I've
[33:50] been trying to get us to see all right
[33:52] this the statement let's just read a few
[33:54] of them think they've got needs to go
[33:56] and we'll get pick up a little bit cause
[33:58] this is what I want you to see
[34:00] I want you to see that the part that
[34:03] we're part of the mystery and got to be
[34:05] revealed what find wonderful say it
[34:10] again where everybody understand it's
[34:12] what I've done had to do in Athens when
[34:14] I was saying that the brighter Jesus
[34:16] Christ into the Son of Man I constantly
[34:18] said brother Branham was not the Prophet
[34:20] brother Branham was a prophet do you
[34:22] understand yeah under a minute I'd come
[34:25] back and that thing and go you know it
[34:27] just like slapping you in the face and
[34:29] I'd say listen folks now understand
[34:33] brother Branham was not the Son of man
[34:37] he was a son of man the Lord Jesus
[34:41] Christ is the son of man now I'm not the
[34:44] one that made these statements I got
[34:47] written in my Bible running the front to
[34:49] keep women where brother Brennan said
[34:51] the bride is the son of money that's a
[34:57] great mystery mr. bride you realize
[35:05] if he's the son of man where the son of
[35:08] man not making us different making us
[35:13] what we're supposed to be but all right
[35:14] let's just let's just read a few of
[35:16] these go ahead to stand it in the gap
[35:19] because we got two well-known mistakes
[35:21] the first one all right this is from
[35:24] sirs we would see Jesus as the church
[35:27] like a pyramid comes into a point
[35:28] twisted hurts in the days of Luke their
[35:31] days of Wesley days will Pentecostal and
[35:33] now just before the headstone comes into
[35:37] it that church has to be home now notice
[35:40] he didn't say maybe it will be hopefully
[35:43] it will be I liked his positive
[35:46] statements What did he say the headstone
[35:49] comes into the church has to be so be
[35:52] home so perfect til the side ministry
[35:56] that he had be it he did here he did
[35:59] here his same spirit so predominant in
[36:04] other words right here alright let me
[36:07] stay what I'm saying over and over we
[36:09] can look back we can look back in the
[36:14] Bible and see the Ministry of Jesus
[36:15] Christ all right we can look back into
[36:21] the end time where the Prophet was
[36:23] preaching the message and bringing it
[36:25] forth to us we can look back to there
[36:28] and say that was God made manifest in a
[36:31] human being not a not demand being God
[36:34] no God was using a man
[36:40] but then we stop when we see and it
[36:44] bounces back at you when you say about
[36:46] now when he's using men what about now
[36:50] when he's using women when he's brought
[36:55] he's bringing forth his bride aren't we
[36:59] saying that we've glory in what the
[37:01] prophet has done with what our glory is
[37:05] right he said something's got to happen
[37:08] to the church by this message that will
[37:11] home the people that will bring us to a
[37:16] position of Jesus Christ all right go
[37:18] ahead get the next one standing in the
[37:22] gap he's talking about the Pentecostal
[37:25] message right in the middle everyone
[37:27] will bring the church this minority and
[37:31] a ministry will be among those people
[37:34] till it'll be exactly the same ministry
[37:38] that Jesus cried did that brings Jesus
[37:41] and catch the whole time yeah but
[37:47] brother Dale that's brother Branham
[37:51] brother Branham had diminish through
[37:53] Jesus Christ see everybody would agree
[37:54] to that
[37:57] look at this and look at that a man but
[38:03] now he's going to the church with it
[38:07] look at the next one
[38:10] watchman what are the knot and what's
[38:13] he's doing he's reflecting reflecting
[38:15] the same light of the Sun that went down
[38:19] years ago and is rising again
[38:21] what is that true church's ministry what
[38:30] is the true church's ministry the
[38:36] Ministry of that church will be the
[38:39] Ministry of the Sun because it's a
[38:44] reflection of the same Sun power and the
[38:47] same sunlight that the world would know
[38:50] when the Sun rises the same ministry
[38:57] reflecting his coming if you're going
[39:00] down into that message he said he's been
[39:02] he's here tonight doing the same thing
[39:05] okay I praise God for that see everybody
[39:12] don't understand me when I and I'm sorry
[39:15] to even have to mention it in a way to
[39:17] where people thank you against what
[39:19] they're saying but see I believe in the
[39:21] return ministry
[39:25] I do because I believe brother Browns
[39:28] gonna rise from the dead and according
[39:33] to him and his message after the
[39:35] resurrection there can be a 30 40 day
[39:38] period
[39:41] are we gonna do set around hey you know
[39:44] resurrections come Gloria okay no it's
[39:51] going to be a resourcing time you say
[39:55] are you thinking he didn't go across the
[39:57] country and all of that just you get all
[39:59] of that in your mind and you study it
[40:01] all out and you decide what you believe
[40:02] it is I'm just telling you
[40:05] that he's going to raise and he can
[40:09] preach to it for 30 40 days we can have
[40:13] great services and wonderful times glory
[40:17] but you remember we've got to get him
[40:19] here first that's the only thing that
[40:23] I've ever said what do you think well no
[40:26] he's no that's worth see there's
[40:28] everybody's got a we got to go through
[40:30] this room we got to do this we got to do
[40:32] that putting in their their own thoughts
[40:34] about what it is instead of seeing just
[40:39] what he said the same ministry of Jesus
[40:42] Christ what is that true church's
[40:45] ministry what is the true church's
[40:48] ministry
[40:49] well they're gonna start with the
[40:51] fivefold ministry so that's gonna be
[40:53] downgrading to most people right because
[40:56] they don't want it to there they want it
[40:57] to start I start with wrote around them
[41:00] and then they've come to the thoughtful
[41:01] ministry brother Branham had the message
[41:04] a man will agree with it he's the one
[41:07] that brought the message but now it's
[41:10] got to be delivered through the fivefold
[41:11] ministry and said take these and sweep
[41:13] it on to the coming of the Lord that's
[41:17] all I've ever looked for in that way
[41:22] then I don't have to worry about it but
[41:24] I'm not sitting down twiddling my thumbs
[41:25] well one of these days one of these days
[41:28] no because I've always said one time I
[41:31] told the church there's one time and I
[41:34] mean it and meaning what I said if if
[41:37] brother Branham came right out here in
[41:39] front of this building put up a tent in
[41:43] etc because these were can't believe it
[41:48] I said you wouldn't know what he's
[41:50] talking about well that heard I'm sorry
[41:53] but it was the best that I could say it
[41:55] I said because the reason you wouldn't
[41:57] know what he's saying you don't know
[41:58] what he's already saying I said that's
[42:01] all I'm saying because I had just proved
[42:04] it
[42:04] because I had quoted to this some people
[42:07] standing there and this brother he said
[42:11] that ain't brought brother damn brother
[42:13] Brown didn't say that I said he said I
[42:17] just listened to the tape the other day
[42:18] and I know he didn't say it I said what
[42:21] brother he did I said I'll bring you the
[42:26] book but when I brought the book I said
[42:28] read that was word-for-word what I've
[42:31] said I wasn't against anything I was
[42:34] just trying to show the people I say it
[42:37] to Lula right now today speaking to you
[42:41] cuz that's who I'm talking to
[42:42] what's holding off the coming of the
[42:45] Lord is you and I will get it a chance
[42:49] now and I thank God for it
[42:51] to prove the side you're standing on the
[42:55] word that people come as I said
[42:57] Wednesday it was like 60 here and a lot
[43:01] of people couldn't come you know but
[43:03] there was like 60 people I didn't say we
[43:06] wouldn't go the house services or know
[43:08] that we were gonna house earlier
[43:10] wouldn't have I just laughed it
[43:12] and if we left it totally open the
[43:15] building would be full today
[43:17] I believe that because the people are
[43:19] getting to the point of seeing hey this
[43:22] is us this is us but if we get along
[43:27] with the government and the agree with
[43:29] your emissary quickly and all of that
[43:31] which is scriptural did we do what they
[43:33] say we have the small amount we do the
[43:36] thing but yet we put it on the internet
[43:38] it's not going to end in what I preach
[43:42] but it's not going I'm not going to beat
[43:44] the government to death I'm not going to
[43:47] beat the Catholic to death it's not time
[43:49] it's time to meet me and you to death
[43:52] just to stand up and say all right we're
[43:56] here this out here in the land of West
[43:59] proven it's got to be the plagues and
[44:02] the things that are happening it's here
[44:04] how long that's going to be they're
[44:06] saying now that could be two or three
[44:07] more months or or you know they're maybe
[44:10] not even how school to the end of the
[44:11] year or different things
[44:15] my lord shirt you realize what this is
[44:20] doing to the economy what told you there
[44:25] on the other Wednesday this is the
[44:27] beginning of the end but let's don't
[44:28] count this to be the end and be such a
[44:30] doom days until we can't be in
[44:32] resourcing in crisis and said hey we've
[44:35] been looking forward to some of these
[44:37] things the way things are tightening up
[44:40] the priests of it 4050 years ago how it
[44:44] was coming
[44:46] well that that to me was the ministry
[44:50] was back there brought it correctly so
[44:53] let's go ahead feel bit more than will
[44:55] hey we can take all day today okay let's
[45:03] see we're on number to read or yeah
[45:07] let's go to number four roller no not
[45:12] what you can see in the other one
[45:13] already the same ministry that he was
[45:17] here when he was leading Christ the same
[45:23] way the same ministry Christ head is in
[45:29] his church tonight okay I can say was in
[45:37] brother Branham as he was standing there
[45:42] but now in Brad form to complete the
[45:46] next Street because the mystery was not
[45:50] to in a listen the mystery was not to
[45:54] end in Jesus back there it would have to
[45:59] end in broad form alright now it wasn't
[46:04] to end in brother branham when he was
[46:06] back there it's to end in broad form but
[46:12] listen that's what I tried to get you
[46:14] see listen brother Brad it was part of
[46:17] the bride
[46:19] he wasn't Jesus but he was part of the
[46:23] bride he's part of this mystery so we
[46:27] can look back and see the mystery of the
[46:29] things that the happenings and what he
[46:31] preached in time and see that he
[46:33] preached these marvelous mysteries which
[46:39] is to end in the bride in bride form
[46:43] okay listen I get tired of living one of
[46:47] the other same ministry Christ had is in
[46:49] his church tonight
[46:50] same time same wonder same spirit same
[46:53] kind of works that Jesus did here on
[46:56] earth the church has to do the same
[46:59] thing if it's not it's not the seed of
[47:02] Abraham so if you don't believe Christ
[47:06] is up with us living in his bride form
[47:09] in the life day then who you understand
[47:11] what he said you're not the seed of
[47:13] Abraham you're not the Bride of Christ
[47:20] go in them
[47:25] see what do we got number five
[47:31] and when Jesus returns now listen let's
[47:39] see what is it at Scripture Oh Willie
[47:42] find faith when he returned will he find
[47:45] faith
[47:45] I remember mentioning that to brother
[47:47] hope one day and he got out and he said
[47:49] thank will he find any faith because the
[47:55] faith is in you and me all right
[47:59] this and when Jesus returns he'll find a
[48:03] church that's washed without spot or
[48:07] wrinkle and it'll be the same ministry
[48:10] he had it'll bring back the headstone
[48:14] same ministry that he had go ahead
[48:28] Mona where we can see a little bit
[48:30] further it's got to be that all right
[48:32] well now then there will come a message
[48:36] Oh hallelujah we know that that same
[48:42] pillar of fire that led Israel we know
[48:47] that the same ministry that accompanied
[48:50] Jesus Christ by the pillar of fire that
[48:55] had him anointed is accompanying the
[48:58] church today okay I'm on a man and start
[49:04] it here put that in brother Branham and
[49:07] his message and him delivering it okay
[49:11] but bring it on to the bride form bring
[49:16] it on to the complete mystery
[49:18] that's all I've ever asked and all the
[49:20] tried to preach don't just stop here but
[49:25] don't look so far out you're under two
[49:26] you can't see it either because you'll
[49:30] overlook the whole time look he said
[49:32] science has proved it no this is back
[49:34] when he was talking about the clouds of
[49:37] different things all the right but now
[49:40] look this is what I like science has
[49:43] proved it we don't need that well we
[49:50] don't need science proving it we believe
[49:53] it
[49:55] wonderful for it to be done but we don't
[49:58] need that that away listen we don't need
[50:01] that God's proved it
[50:03] see it's proved in our hearts and lives
[50:06] that's all I've ever tried to preach
[50:07] that's a personal revelation to each and
[50:09] every one of us because listen if Bob is
[50:14] part of the Bride of Christ you know
[50:16] that Bob's got to be revealed but he
[50:18] don't have to be revealed like we're
[50:20] making reveal to put him out here to do
[50:22] this without of the other
[50:24] no he's doing it himself and what he's
[50:28] doing he's proving his own self and what
[50:33] he's doing is that hard to believe
[50:39] well brother Dale we got the ability now
[50:42] we can just cut you okay
[50:44] that's not I had no problem I'm just
[50:46] joking cuz you're not gonna do it said
[50:52] we need the ministry of Jesus Christ to
[50:56] fit that headstone coming yonder that's
[51:00] brought the church into a place to where
[51:04] the minister is exactly like it was when
[51:07] Jesus Christ left okay I'm say it again
[51:12] we've seen that in brother Branham no
[51:17] problem we've seen the same Minister
[51:19] Jesus Christ we've seen that the dead
[51:21] raised the sick he only thought when I
[51:24] bring it on over to see the masked that
[51:30] in this way without you misunderstanding
[51:31] me see he spoke of the bride if you
[51:36] don't want I mean if you want to listen
[51:37] to a message a coach a spoken word is
[51:40] the original seed and read it over and
[51:44] over to messengers remember he says in
[51:49] there he says talking about the baptism
[51:50] of the whole go he said it brings it
[51:53] back exactly like it was in the
[51:54] beginning he said I never seen that
[51:57] before
[51:59] that baptism with the Holy Ghost brother
[52:01] into your heart brings you back exactly
[52:04] the way you should have been in the
[52:05] beginning that's how much I think for
[52:09] the Bride of Christ I'm not looking for
[52:15] the world and what it's doing that's all
[52:18] natural
[52:21] but to find the people that are
[52:23] believing who they are that arrested
[52:28] when the bride realized who she is and
[52:30] what she's here for said she'll be an
[52:32] invincible army who is she she's him
[52:39] that's my whole point
[52:41] that's all they don't try to do cuz
[52:46] let's go let's see what we get - I'll go
[52:52] down to number seven okay okay rolled it
[52:59] up just a little more we can see down
[53:01] ever how you look now the complete
[53:04] fullness of the Godhead bodily
[53:07] dwell Zin his church how much more
[53:11] simple now now say it correctly we
[53:16] understand brother Branham was not a
[53:19] prophet outside he was in the basis of
[53:23] his ministry and the way it was used in
[53:26] the same I believe he was above the FIFO
[53:29] ministry I go we had our because he
[53:31] would end up the one prophet that was
[53:33] are predestinated to come to this
[53:36] position all right I don't go either but
[53:40] just remember
[53:44] that's got to come into the church okay
[53:50] motor Brenham didn't say my message look
[53:54] hard snow listen once a little random
[53:56] never said look how my message has
[53:58] stirred the world it's done this and
[54:01] it's done that he just kept on preaching
[54:05] but you see the brides when she begins
[54:08] to say I my father won and he's other
[54:10] thing she's gonna disturb are you
[54:14] looking for a disturbance yes sir always
[54:17] been looking for one maybe not seeing it
[54:20] maybe because we're missing it well what
[54:22] we're looking at but okay come on listen
[54:24] the complete fullness of the Godhead
[54:26] bodily dwells in his church the
[54:28] preeminence all that God was he poured
[54:33] into Christ and all Christ was was
[54:36] poured into the church the believers now
[54:41] I'm not making this as a smart a true
[54:42] statement but you know how that's been
[54:44] made
[54:45] they said brother all God was he 14 to
[54:47] Christ all Christ poured and brother
[54:49] branham he died took it with him we had
[54:50] nothing left you ever heard that
[54:52] statement made let's see I don't agree
[54:56] with that I believe we're here at the
[55:02] end
[55:07] okay let's just read this go ahead and
[55:09] I'm right then the bride body must
[55:13] follow the head for it is part of his
[55:16] resurrection and part of the mystery are
[55:22] you listening
[55:22] it's impossible for it not to go oh my
[55:28] it's part of God's mystery how God
[55:32] revealed himself here and raised it up
[55:35] by the word so he reveals his church and
[55:40] raises it up by the same word it's a
[55:43] part of history fo mister all God was
[55:48] reporting across all Christ in the
[55:49] church take him back to the Garden of
[55:51] Eden she's part of the mystery let's see
[55:55] that's always been my my thoughts I'm
[55:58] you know like I said somebody asked me
[56:00] one time cuz they knew I'd preach them
[56:02] the bride being the son of man said how
[56:05] do you feel about that now I said how
[56:06] did you think over the field
[56:09] I feel it oh I think more about it today
[56:12] than I did in nineteen in 69 when I
[56:15] preached it what the word made it alive
[56:21] is the son of man right the son of man
[56:29] is that word made alive let's just
[56:32] trying to find out what we're okay
[56:34] boy number nine let's get this and then
[56:36] we'll we'll quit okay you see if you
[56:44] were in the foreknowledge of God then
[56:47] you are becoming a part of God the only
[56:51] way you can be a son of God or a
[56:53] daughter of God you had to be a part of
[56:56] God and God isn't complete without you
[57:04] well because he imparted itself unto you
[57:07] you his wife that's what he thinks of
[57:10] his wife he thinks more of his wife that
[57:14] he does his own self
[57:16] he never bragged on his own self
[57:19] he always bragged on his wife the church
[57:22] the bride and there was the prophet able
[57:28] to stand there with the hills and the
[57:30] signs and the wonders and the thing and
[57:32] he would have had the ability to say
[57:35] listen do you believe who I am because
[57:38] I've got the Ministry of Jesus Christ
[57:41] you know he'd be telling truth but how
[57:46] did he say
[57:47] he said to Ministry of Jesus Christ is
[57:50] here rein it in to him he's here but
[57:56] it's going to be in the church the
[58:01] fullness of the Godhead bodily wells in
[58:05] his church what a wonderful day what a
[58:09] wonderful time let's see what was will
[58:12] God is not complete without you it has
[58:15] to be because there is one only one
[58:18] resource of eternal life and that is God
[58:21] and him alone has eternal life see now
[58:23] and you were a part of him in so much
[58:26] that you're an attribute or in his
[58:28] thinking in the beginning and that
[58:30] because he thought of you in the
[58:33] beginning it gives that little tug
[58:35] toward him that's what has to be quicken
[58:39] some of them will never be quickened
[58:41] they just don't have it that's all
[58:44] I never throw it off on anybody into
[58:49] what they see or what they preach or
[58:52] anything the only thing that I've ever
[58:55] said when are we gonna realize who we
[58:58] are you realize he chose you
[59:08] he chose meaning you like I said we were
[59:10] chosen in him and he's not complete
[59:18] without me and you
[59:24] let's really do one more let's go to
[59:28] number 10 get this and then walk with
[59:33] the word is in the bride and the mind of
[59:39] Christ to know what he wants done with
[59:43] the word and she does it in his name
[59:48] she has thus saith the Lord
[59:51] then it's Dermott eyes so the Holy
[59:53] Spirit waters it until it has grown and
[59:57] serves his purpose they do only his will
[1:00:01] amen I believe that no one can persuade
[1:00:04] them different they have thus saith the
[1:00:06] Lord or they keep still well see I
[1:00:12] believe we have thus saith the Lord the
[1:00:16] prophets message made alive in you and I
[1:00:20] what would be the difference in God's
[1:00:25] saying it are you saying it if you're
[1:00:28] his wife if you're speaking in his place
[1:00:31] what's the definite
[1:00:33] yeah but that's just not that ain't
[1:00:35] enough they where it is himself in them
[1:00:38] continuing his word to fulfill as he now
[1:00:42] listen listen to this last few
[1:00:45] statements as he did complete now holder
[1:00:50] in his days all think when he was here
[1:00:56] now watch him he's correcting it as he
[1:00:59] did complete in his day he never
[1:01:02] completed all of his work when he was
[1:01:05] here let's see we read that and can use
[1:01:09] that statement apart but not reader s
[1:01:11] often when he was here he did not
[1:01:15] complete all when he was here for it was
[1:01:19] not time yet how do you follow me he
[1:01:26] didn't complete it you know why because
[1:01:30] his wife's gone completely his little
[1:01:32] Brides gonna complete it she's gonna be
[1:01:36] him made manifest she's gonna walk in
[1:01:41] the word of the hour and believe it
[1:01:44] believe what he says about us it's to be
[1:01:48] true see that's that's all that I've
[1:01:53] ever tried like I said that brother
[1:01:54] asked me what was my thought that's my
[1:01:56] thought that's my point has always been
[1:01:59] a positive attitude about the word of
[1:02:03] God
[1:02:06] I'd MIT I mean I'm a human I've read a
[1:02:10] lot of things that I didn't know what in
[1:02:11] the world the Prophet was talking about
[1:02:13] and you I mean maybe a pawn or a thought
[1:02:17] or anything he just didn't didn't get it
[1:02:19] but you just keep reading instead it in
[1:02:22] one day it just comes up hey he was
[1:02:25] saying the same thing all the time but
[1:02:29] it just wouldn't be in quickened what
[1:02:33] about the little ride making God
[1:02:37] manifest for the life stage waiting for
[1:02:42] a waiting in the sky
[1:02:43] come on musicians I just pray that it
[1:02:47] was out there on the internet and the
[1:02:49] things that listen to what I'm saying
[1:02:50] God I know that I try to make statements
[1:02:53] and I do I hurt feelings because they
[1:02:55] think of this or that I've never had
[1:02:57] anything
[1:03:00] to try to hurt anybody's feelings and
[1:03:02] say well I see I've stood a lot of times
[1:03:06] standing there with the word to know you
[1:03:09] could cut a person to pieces with it but
[1:03:11] I'll never do it because it's not made
[1:03:17] for that it's made to preach it's made
[1:03:20] to live it's made to be what he says
[1:03:25] we're supposed to be Stan what do we got
[1:03:28] ready anybody has a need and those I
[1:03:33] don't internet just remember where
[1:03:34] you're sitting now you can reach up and
[1:03:37] touch God for whatever you have need of
[1:03:38] same as you can here
[1:03:46] [Music]
[1:03:57] when I awake
[1:04:01] in the morning when I
[1:04:05] I am
[1:04:10] ah
[1:04:15] anybody having a
[1:04:21] I am

[1:04:34] when I wake up when I am
[1:04:45] [Music]
[1:05:06] all that mankind had done for 4,000
[1:05:12] years cluster to back me over if they
[1:05:16] give the paper to realize who they are
[1:05:18] and what we're here for
[1:05:23] so you know how to raise up say what
[1:05:26] state is under challenge you do you
[1:05:29] better be careful at work
[1:05:30] let him challenge you
[1:05:35] that's why we didn't write it up what
[1:05:37] they said is well we've got a
[1:05:39] constitutional right no I would just go
[1:05:45] along with it because it's right trying
[1:05:49] to help mankind or try to make you
[1:05:57] believe a doctor and then we have to
[1:05:59] make our stand then it'll be time
[1:06:05] because it'll be them challenging us
[1:06:09] don't try to challenge somebody may be
[1:06:12] careful there was a little over us
[1:06:14] Terrence knew him I thought that way do
[1:06:17] you Billie free he's a big mouth he was
[1:06:21] he was just a big mouth and and but I've
[1:06:27] seen him too worth it
[1:06:29] you know a lot of people didn't know him
[1:06:31] like I did then so one day some guys was
[1:06:36] hollering about he was talking about
[1:06:38] something about him huh and then just a
[1:06:41] minute there was a couple of them was
[1:06:43] needing some plaster work done because
[1:06:47] he was the kind that would back up what
[1:06:49] he said when he was pushed most people
[1:06:54] didn't know that about him but I knew
[1:06:55] him I knew to leave him alone I knew he
[1:06:57] was feisty lightning and I knew he could
[1:06:59] whoop any deity whooping eyes artwork
[1:07:02] and everybody beginning a little
[1:07:04] different respect for the old boy
[1:07:06] because but just remember my point is
[1:07:08] why we don't challenge them they
[1:07:15] challenge us cause gods on our side amen
