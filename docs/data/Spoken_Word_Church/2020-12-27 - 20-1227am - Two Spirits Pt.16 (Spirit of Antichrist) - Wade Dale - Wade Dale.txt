holy holy holy i want to see amen good to be in the house of the lord it's good to be alive and well know that jesus is alive and well living in me to tell the world let me get these announcements out of the way while you're standing um for all of you that are going to sing next thursday night meet after service to practice your songs with sister trudy i don't think uh sister christine they're on their way remember they're yoregos they're on their way back they took a little mini vacation and i think panama city or somewhere so they're on the way back today just keep them in your prayers and i'm sure they're they're listening in so but practice after service if you're going to sing a song for what's not service all right also there will be no wednesday service coming up this week it will be thursday because that's the 31st and that's when brother william borlavon will be here to preach for us the fellowship or the what's not service and that'll start at 8 o'clock on thursday all right there'll be no food like we usually have food and finger food and all that stuff won't have any of that just if you want to come a little early and fellowship just wear your mask and stand away from each other and i just want to i just want to make this announcement don't see how this is working because people are still getting sick i'm sorry it's just it's just just happening okay we just gotta pray we just gotta pray that god will help us to get rid of this thing and protect us amen now next sunday there will be two services we'll start with two services brother they'll be doing the morning service and i'll be doing the afternoon service at two o'clock now what we're going to do is everybody listen since we have a limited amount of space down in the fellowship hall what we're going to do is terrence has talked to a few of you but this is what we're going to try to do instead of packing everybody in and everybody being downstairs and getting ready for second service and some people are sitting downstairs now it's full so what we're going to do is rotate families eating out or eating your car or not eating in the saints in the uh downstairs in the fellowship hall so the first next sunday my family richard roberts family and terence's family are gonna eat out so we're gonna and you don't have to when we say eat out it means don't bring your food downstairs and eat in the fellowship hall you can sit in your car and eat you can sit outside if it's pretty you don't have to go out and eat you just will not be sitting at your normal table that you normally sit at but brother bob brother joe brother luis brother tony these are families brother kern brother anderson brother ryan brother john duret brother tim martinez you can use the saints the keeps in sanctuary you can use the downstairs fellowship hall to eat at everybody got that and usually this is what we were looking at this these are the normal people that stay some of you don't some of you go out every service and eat so we're not talking about you but these people can have their meals downstairs sit with your family we're still going to try to keep this thing where we can social distance as much as we can but families are going to be around each other anyway so may as well let the family sit with each other but my family richard's family intensive family will go out and eat next sunday the rest of you will fill up wherever needs to be filled up downstairs and then next sunday uh brother terrence will announce this coming sunday for next sunday the other three that's going to go out and if you want to go out that's fine it doesn't mean you have to stay this is but it means that if you normally stay here and eat which i do richard does and terrence usually does that we're gonna have to go out and eat and give a space for somebody to sit all right everybody got that okay all right so we're gonna try that going back to two services um next sunday that'll be on january the third we'll start the new year hopefully a little bit normal all right i said a little bit normal also all right here we go we need to get your christmas cards out of the christmas card box downstairs because we're getting ready to put all that stuff up because we are almost finished with the holidays thank you for all the gifts and all the time and all the food and everything you've given us it's been a challenging holiday but it's been a good one amen because we're alive and well amen we're here and we're able to lift our hands up and put our feet on the ground and worship god amen and that's what the devil hates you don't hate anything else but you putting your feet on the ground and saying god thank you for another day amen because you know what he can't do anything about that until god's finished with you amen so it makes him mad so that's okay also now remember by way of some more prayer requests brother claude had his gallbladder taken out he has he had to have it drained because it was gangrene or close to it so he's had a drain tube had to be back in the hospital during christmas well he's home today so he came home yesterday so just keep praying for him all right and anna and richard are at in tennessee remember them they'll be traveling back home thursday or so the uregos are on their way home remember brother homer he's at home but he still got the virus and now the uh announcement came in brother david gadman and sister laura may have it because they're having the symptoms so and several people in their church are going through it also so we just need to pray just keep praying all we got to do just keep praying there's nothing else you can do you can take all these pills you want to and you can take all these virus antivirus things you want to but prayer works above all that amen that's what the brother said one time he said there's no secret pill you can take but the gospel he said you read that gospel and it'll help you out man so we're going today we're going to read the gospel starting in first john 4. and i think that's about all i don't know if anybody has any other announcements but that's what we're making so far just remember two services next sunday and we'll try to rotate downstairs and you'll get your schedule for the next week there'll be three families that's going to have to rotate out and if you want to volunteer to do that you need to speak to brother terrence probably thursday and i think anna's helping him also so they're they're handling that and just keep remembering to you because he's still got that kidney stone and uh not feeling well today so first john four verse one let's go to the lord and pray the heavenly father thank you lord for this day you've given us an opportunity to stand before the purchased possession of your blood lord we pray now that you would take that blood and cover us lord you your word lord is what we long for more than anything else because that will destroy and defeat the devil every time if we'll just stay fortified behind that word lord that says by your stripes we're already healed and that you would give us blessings lord that from heaven that we can't even contain lord if we do what you said in the word father just be with us take care of us in the furtherment of the service be the ones that we've talked about here that are sick and the new year coming up lord on thursday the new year's service lord we pray that you'd be with brother william be with each one lord the singers and all the different ones that we'll have a good time in you and then lord will be taking communion there right at midnight father and lord we pray that our communion with you will not be with just wine and bread for the rest of this year until you come lord but it would be a communion of us and you father and as the prophet said in that secret chamber lord where you can speak to us lord sweet words into our ears father we pray that you just be with lord the ones that are sick around the world be the little bride lord keep her safe lord we ask you to bless this service you be the active participant you do the work today lord it will never fail if you do the work in jesus name we ask these things lord amen first john 4 we're going to talk about spirit of antichrist now we're going to bring it from spirit of antichrist up to a person today so just bear with me for a minute first john 4 verse 1 says beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world so here we've got a situation we know they're there they were there 2000 years ago when john penned this so they're here more now amen and i'll read to you i was researching some how many denominations in the world so you're going to be really surprised when i give you the number hereby know you the spirit of god every spirit that confesses that jesus christ is coming the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ has come in the flesh it's not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist everybody got that this is that spirit of antichrist because it has to start as a spirit right whereof you have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world working silently uh covertly among the people but remember everything we're talking about this antichrist spirit is gonna head up into a person that you're gonna be able to look at we're not the bride's gonna be gone but the world's gonna look at this beast this antichrist is not going to be a system anymore it's going to be a person it heads up in a beast all right it was a beast in the beginning it's going to be a beast in the end all right year of which is already in the world are of god little children have overcome them because greater he that's in you what a promise than he that's in the world they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not of god hereth not us hereby know we look hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error you may be seated in the lord as blessing to the reading of the word let's read our uh quote that we've been reading for so many times here this be part 16. you ought to be able to quote it by heart says now remember this christ in the true church now what did we talk about the other day there was there's a true church there is truth but it's not scattered in many different directions there's only one truth there wasn't four jesuses on the earth there wasn't two jesuses on the earth there was one that stood up one day and said i am the way i am the truth and i am the life amen so where is that person there there now by the baptism of the holy ghost he's in me and you amen now we can't say that we're the way but we have the way amen we have the way i was thinking yesterday you know we uh there's so much uncertainty in the world and that's what you know we were talking uh meeting another guy the other day about fear the bible says fear bringeth torment and that's what the world's doing they're tormented by the fear not knowing what's going to happen tomorrow the next day the new administration coming in and all these different things that everybody's fearful of but you know what it struck my heart i said god i said you told me in the bible everything that was going to happen and you wrote it because you saw it already happen and now you're inside of me amen uh he's inside of you so what are we fearing we must look to the bible look to the god that we have called the holy ghost that guides us and you know what he'll tell us what's coming up next year he's already told us in the bible what's coming up right we got everything in place that needs to be and that person that knows everything is going to happen next year is inside of you and brother branham told us that we were prophetic people we look at the prophetic we look at the what's coming and you know what it's not something like i said before all the doctrines and we'll get into this just maybe a little bit and i may have to do one more service on this but you get into many doctrines of the denominations and like i said before you're going to be really uh well i'll just tell you now i wrote myself a note what is truth i looked in the on the internet there's 30 000. worldwide christian organizations 30 000 with all different views now is our god that confused there's 1200 in the united states alone 1200 different christian organizations that one says that if you have a church on sunday you're the antichrist seventh-day adventist they read the same bible this one over here says this is the way it is or you or you're out this one over here says this is the way it is or you're out this one over here says you got to baptize this one says you can sprinkle this one says where there's no millennium and this one says there is a millennium this one says there's not this and then there's this is god that confused he can't be he's got to be there's then there's got to be the truth there's got to be the way the truth and the life and it's got to be the true revelation that's what we were talking about here says christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts we'll read the quote but the book of revelation shows how that an antichrist spirit would come into the church defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless by what by their teaching by what they believe like i said before how many of you have have have heard many people in the past you know they say oh well mom's gone on and she's sitting at the feet of jesus or she's walking on the streets or going that's not true there's none of that in the bible they used to call them a wives tales because if it's not true it's gotta be a lie but thank god he sent us a prophet that went across the curtain of time says oh they're in a beautiful place they're in another dimension they're sitting over there in eternity but jesus is not there that's right we see him at his coming we meet him in the air now that's bible that's not fables all these other things are fables they tell you you can do certain things and it's not true in the bible well who's true many of these 1200 denominations have women preachers that ain't even bible sorry nothing against the women but the bible says a woman should keep silent amen and all these other things different things that's why i said before you look at this you think man how in the world did did god get that confused from a.d 30 when the man stood there and said i am the way i am the truth i am the life 120 in the upper room caught that same revelation with the by the baptism of the holy ghost right and took it to the world out of 120 then 3 000 downstairs and then bro zach by the by the second church age in about 8 100 here they start scattering here's sirenthis you know there's doctrines in the message now that jesus wasn't god to the river jordan he became god well that doctrine is not new that doctrine started back in about a.d 50. amen 86 the 80-70 brother bob brought me the the history on it where that cyrenthius was a was a they started preaching that jesus was not the substance of god he was the life substance of god well see that was a saying that's what we're going to get into in a minute that was a saying don't you think don't you think maybe that that just couldn't be gone he cried he died he had to eat that can't be gone but he can be like god he can be a second person see what i mean because we're going to talk about today with sayings deeds doctrine and then incarnate it's going to incarnate a person same way you by the baptism the holy ghost go through justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost and then god incarnate amen satan cannot satan cannot make that happen but he can duplicate it remember he's not an originator remember he's not a creator but he can get so close till the end time they're going to believe now in the end time there's going to rise up a man that they're going to think god almighty and human flesh but it's satan i wrote myself a note look it's so close because i was thinking about this the other day you watch that spirit you watch what though the antichrist spirit called the real spirit when jesus was on earth when jesus was on earth let's take it to the end time but let's go back and see what when jesus when the son of man was on earth doing the things he did they called him a devil they didn't call him just the devil they called him the head of the demons they called him beelzebub the very word of god see what i'm saying the very word of god they said belgium called him a wine bible said oh he he hangs around sinners and he's he's this and he's that he's not he can't be the son of god yet he fulfilled all of the old testament he walked up one day and he said what part did i not fulfill what part am i not go read your bible you religious people he said by your traditions denominational ideas you have made the word of god of none effect to the people and there stood the word they called him bielge above they said you are just joseph's boy you're illegitimate but he was the word of god he fooled he fulfilled the word of god to the letter he wasn't off one word and the religious groups come on somebody the religious groups of that day called him a devil why because he was out of the normal yeah that's right he was out of the normal denominational idea when they had a nice seeing council which they had a real one in in 606 and 325 but they had a couple of nice seeing councils when jesus was there and he walked up and he said unless you believe i am he you'll die in your sins and i just throw them over a loop i said what do you mean you're bialzebum jesus just looked at him and said how can satan cast out satan how can the devil how can a the man of the house in other words the strong man of the house come on throw the strong man of the house out how you throw a strong man he's talking about god he's somebody himself really how can you throw the strong man out he's the strong man of the house see what i'm saying though you take that and bring it right here today because the antichrist spirit is going to call the real spirit of god antichrist because that's what they were saying they were saying you're anti-christ but he was the christ that's right you and i are the christ by the baptism of the holy ghost and the world thinks we're crazy we're not normal we're not meeting on saturday we're not baptizing the way the rest of the world you know the whole world baptizes one way except for just a few groups of people jesus said unless you believe that i am he yes you'll die in your sin and they died in their sins and nice all the different high priests they live the word to the letter what their denomination required they lived it but when the one that came that was the truth they called him a denomination they called him bill's above they caught they said we don't want anything to do with you think about it today we're living in this world but remember we're not of the world when when the old saying is when the screws start tightening just a little bit more it's going to start separating folks because we're we're already now in in part of the of the world now where you can't move you can't do things there's already um rumblings going on that that even brother louise were telling me that he's gonna try to go maybe to nicaragua into different places do you know you're gonna have to have a vaccination card before you leave hmm and a vaccination card to get back in so you got to take their vaccine before you can go anywhere maybe before you can move around right maybe before you can get in walmart you got to go scan your card right that you've took that silly vaccine they're trying to give people be careful about that take it if you want to but i'm telling you i wouldn't take it from my life because right now there are already side effects they're even seeing now so i wouldn't take that thing for nothing in the world i'm going to take the gospel and i'm going to believe it that's okay listen there's listen we've had vaccines for measles rubella those were and jonah's salt brother branham said jonah salt god gave him the not the idea but gave him the ability to come up with that polio vaccine amen i believe that but this crazy thing is coming this here now i don't believe nothing they've run it through too quick listen there's something behind all this and you know that as well as i do but let's get on to this this is so close though what you and i were sitting in a church today and we're all comfortable but wait until we are asked the questions of what is your religion what is your normal well well we don't believe the bible even tells us to be baptized in the name father son holy ghost jesus said in the name of the father and of the son of the holy ghost which is the lord jesus christ and we know that but the world doesn't the world will fight you over that one thing no eternal hell do you believe eternal hell no we do not believe in eternal hell we believe in eternal judgment but we do not believe in an eternal burning hell because the bible does not tell you there's a burning eternal hell all right because you'd have to have eternal life to go to hell and you can't do that all right you can't do that because to me hell will be void of eternal life that's why it's going to be a living hell because it'll be void of of christ it'll be void of god right but the world's going to nail us down just like they did jesus and they hung him on a cross because he wasn't of their normal right he was not of their denomination he wasn't even close to their denomination and you know what he stood up one day and he told him about it too and that's what got paul killed that's what got peter killed and that's what got a lot of people killed is because why it's that same spirit that cain killed abel same spirit that got on cane because abel's denominator doctrine was right and cain's denomination that he had set up was wrong so you see what we're heading toward but thank god revelations 3 says we have a faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god is brother dale's been speaking now remember you and i are the continuation of that because looking you keep reading this quote it said it exposes satan we were talking about that last sunday it exposes satan because what are we doing everything's good you know we're okay we're walking through the world but all of a sudden they're gonna start like i said before something's gonna come about where you're gonna have to make a choice of whether you stay with the normal or will you get put over here in this group but what are you doing you're not what did jesus christ do when he came on earth he came and exposed satan that's why they hated him because you put satan inside of a human oh yeah that's worse than anything but now murderers and all those different things that's bad but you take a religious demon and put him in a man that's worse that's worse because he'll deceive you see a murderer comes in here and acts murderer or somebody a drug dealer that's not going to deceive me i know what's in that man but when a religious man walks in and he's so close until it's right at the very end there's got to be a separation time but it all started as a spirit of antichrist yes but it's heading up into what if it heads up into god in human flesh it's going to head up in satan in the human flesh amen all right so let's finish this quote it exposes satan revealing his works attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the greater work she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation now look how many times he used the word true if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discerning withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be what powerless before her let's go to revelations 3 and to the angel the church of laodicea which is this age these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god now remember that word true was not as in it was false at one time but what happened is god's always been true that's a given who's brought the faults in man man and satan through man has added a little bit to make it an untrue witness that which has not only the name and resemblance but the real nature corresponding to the name in every respect corresponding to the idea signified by the name real true and genuine in other words all the trash is going to be done away in the end time there's not going to be a church that sits and says okay we believe in this and it not be of the bible i'm talking about truth true church we're talking about true church all right you say all that never can happen no yeah it can that's why i'm telling you the son of man revelation is back to where jesus was standing on the earth two thousand years ago and what he said that's what you and i are gonna have to say and he can't deviate that's why peter didn't stand up on the day of pentecost and say repent everybody and be baptized in the name of the father and of the son another holy ghost that's not what jesus said by revelation yes peter caught the revelation and said you've got to be baptized by the name of somebody so it's the name of jesus christ for the remission he sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost what a gift let's read number two god's provided place of worship so now at the end time we see the things happening the way they are there's a great warning amongst the elected people of god to find what is right and it behooves us to know that now not somebody's theory but to know what is truth what the bible says is the truth because it'll be too late one of these days for us and this may be the day so let's take real consideration of what god has said let's go to john 17 verse 16. jesus is praying he says they are not of this world even as i am not of the world sanctify them through thy truth thy word is true so the only way we're going to get sanctified is through the truth the true word of god as thou has sent men to the world even so have i sent them into the world so whatever jesus christ was equipped with come on somebody whatever jesus christ was equipped with he's sending us in the same in the world with the same equipment right or it's not true right here and for their sake i sanctify myself that they also may be sanctified through the truth glory the spirit of truth the spirit of error all right now let's go to what is truth here's what i found in the internet there's 30 000 worldwide christian organizations 30 000 some of them have different gods but these are christian organizations these are organizations that believe of some form that jesus was the savior of the world this is not including all the radicals and there's 1200 in the united states alone 1200 different ways of looking at this bible let's read first john 4 verse 3 again this was part of the one that we read when we began and every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ has come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist all right wherever you have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world as a baby listen the only communication you had back in the first probably four church ages which was the first thousand years of existence after jesus left the earth was what it was not in book form the bible only came being there you know about what fifteen hundred sixteen hundreds so a thousand years twelve hundred fifteen 1500 years it was word of mouth oh yeah you had people would scribe things and write it down but i mean if if um irenaeus came out and preached the sermon it wasn't recorded so the people had to take what he said right right and run it through their filter to see if it was right or not they didn't have a look at me and you we've got all this information we've got all this we can go back in the internet and we can go back into this and look at all this information to see if it's true or not but what they had was is they compared it with what what was already inside of them they didn't have a quote book to go back to amen even paul's writings and all were lost for periods of time so what they believe in they run it through their holy ghost filter and something inside of them that they had to depend on said that ain't nothing but the truth or that ain't nothing but the error amen what are you saying brother sometimes we because paul even comes up and he says the letter will kill you the letter will kill you but the spirit on the letter is what gives you life amen so let's look right here pull these next ones up because the way this thing started out we know one thing's for sure was a saying went out oh yeah you know there was a saying that jesus was almighty god and then there was a saying that he was bells above amen there was a saying that went out that said what did philip say thou art the christ thou art the king of israel that he he without the holy ghost philip hadn't had the holy ghost yet or the one that said that nathanael whichever one said that he didn't have the holy ghost he responded by what he saw come see a man the lady said at the pool she said come see a man. but now remember what she said she said we know see they had old testament to read but they didn't have a new testament but she even by revelation saw that he was fulfilling the old testament that's why i said before let me bring this out again all the religious organizations in jesus time called him a devil but every time jesus walked up listen listen when he approached legion which had many demons what did the demons say to jesus thou art the son of god why have you come to what torment us before our time i think that's twice in the gospels jesus would go and talk to somebody with a demon and the demon would talk back and say we know who you are the devils knew he was jesus christ he was almighty god and the religious people thought he was the devil yeah yeah look how backwards it is that's the same thing i'm gonna do to me in you they're gonna say you're not normal that's right you don't accept normal practices that's all right paul said by the way of call heresy i do i serve god you know what they thought paul was crazy but he wrote 80 of the new testament that's to me that's that's okay i'll be crazy like that but it became a saying because people would boy didn't you hear that sermon by brother so-and-so this morning said i think he meant this oh buddy when you come up and say i think right you're in trouble i think i thought that's what the saying was sirenthis probably got him a little congregation and said oh this great here's this great revelation jesus could not be almighty god because he cried he died all these things but now we know he was a good man we know he was a prophet because he would foretell things and all so so so maybe i think maybe then you've got god up here and you got jesus down here and he talked of coming back as a spirit so there's one two three see how simple that looks though who reads the bible and i was reading it the other day in corinthians or ephesians where jesus said the god of our the god and father of our lord jesus christ bless you all well boy the trinitarians are like wow look at that why there's three or four of them standing around up there when no way in paul's teaching was he thinking of that amen it was not trinitarian the first original church had no doctrine except the truth the original first church that's why we're going to read here in a minute where malachi 4 had to come back to restore that there had to be a spirit of elijah come to restore us back to when there was no 1200 different ways of looking at the bible where there was no 30 000 different ways of looking at the bible amen a saying and what is a deed a deed is something that you do so they started doing it they started preaching and teaching all these different things then we come up to 325 and i see a rome and we see that it solidified a little more the doctrine because i read you the quote before where 1500 people went so many of them were true believers a lot of them were not true believers they wanted what they had constantine sitting there everybody thought constantine was this great christian man because he put crosses on the backs of the of the soldiers and told them to go out but you know what they were doing when they got there they were persecuting the real christians the people that didn't believe because you know what they did they held that sword and they said you believe in the holy roman catholic church and they said antichrist amen 68 million people 68 million christians were killed during the dark ages not during during this time right here not during this time there were just little sayings little deeds but boy when it become a doctrine when they put their seal on it and said this is it you believe it this way or you die that's right amen and then what's going to happen with that it continued on folks not just now it's a doctrine all over the world thirty thousand different in twelve hundred in the united states it's coming into the head of an incarnate antichrist or the bible calls him the beast that rises up in the end time and speaks like god sitting in the temple of god showing himself that he is god not that he wants to be god he's showing himself that he is god so this thing has went from a baby form a spirit of antichrist to incarnate antichrist right same way with you we go through what justification what you don't you just understand one thing jesus christ just forgave you your sins that's all you know because what's justification justification is chopping off your past sin you turn and go that way amen so there you living under state now what's deeds sanctification what is these i quit smoking i quit drinking i quit doing drugs i quit doing that's not saying you got god in your soul that's just god cleaning you up according to the book of luke the unclean spirit goes out of a man you're you're doing works you're doing deeds right but you're not filled with the holy ghost yet and they did not pin this during this part this is where it was what sealed right where are you sealed you're not sealed right here right here you're sealed right here you're sealed by the baptism of the holy ghost they sealed their doctrine at nicea they said this is it and you can't change it right then look me and you as we grow up the statue of a perfect man listen we're in baby form right here this is not baby form this is our time this is adoption time where it's not you speaking it's god speaking through you and there's not an argument you know that was a whole deal when jesus was on earth he never argued with the spirit that was inside of him because they were the same he said okay we can't be that way why can't we be that way why can't we by the spirit of adoption and all these different things that the spirit that lives in you that was in jesus dwelt in you you've got to believe and and and try our best listen we all have come from sin but we can live so close to jesus christ if we'll let him let him take over brother dale said let him in that spirit realm let him in that memories and conscious effects and imagination because you know what paul tells us paul tells us now we've come up to a place where we have the mind of christ now did not adam have the mind of christ adam had the mind of christ so much so he named all the animals and god never had to reverse the process jesus walked on earth and he never i read your quote the other day where brother brown said jesus never had to back anything back off of what he said nothing now you and i do it every day every few minutes for some of us we have to go no i didn't really mean that but jesus never walked up one day and said look i've been telling y'all for a year but i really didn't mean what i said no he said what he meant and he meant what he said why because he didn't it wasn't a war between him and the spirit that was inside of him you and i have a war between us but when we become incarnate god as i said before when death walks up our sleeve and i was talking to him talking to a baptist girl cuts her hair she said what do you think about this she asked a lot of questions i said look i i she's talking about dying she said has everybody got to die i said no jenny read the bible i said her name sorry read the bible paul says we which are alive and remain to the coming of the lord shall not prevent or hinder those which are fiction to be resurrected i said that's bible if you believe one you got to believe the rest of it i said so we have got to be some we that don't die that's right amen and you can't die with a denominational idea because that's what's killing us our ideas is what's killing us amen saying deed doctrine incarnate antichrist justification sanctification baptism in the holy ghost makes incarnate god back on the earth just like it was 2 000 years ago whoa that's too much no paul said i pray i'm reading bible here i pray that your whole body spirit and soul in other words be preserved or perfected until the end your whole body spirit and soul he didn't leave anything out because you know what paul couldn't see it like we see it but he saw enough to know that there was coming a bride in the end time that was not going to fall for all these denominational ideas it's not going to fall for all these untruths that we've been all brought up with yes just like the four horse riders the four horse riders we were talking about the other day it's four it's not horses it's powers in the bible a horse is a power a beast is a power it's something that you use to get somewhere well as satan uses four which is what white right red black and pale god uses four combat beasts to combat these four horse riders or four horses now same rider but it's four horses four different powers he uses the lion the ox of man and the eagle the anointing of the holy ghost in the ages to combat that that was riding out even in the small but look satan's smart folks he didn't start out riding a red horse he didn't start out riding the black horse he didn't start out riding the pale horse that said death he started out as a white church he started out as a little white oh beautiful but there was one part of him it was black because he was deaf to begin with but he was hiding he was hiding under the the guise of a white righteous church sayings deeds doctrines right incarnate it has to start with listen you've either got to start with the spirit of antichrist or the spirit of christ there's no other spirit anywhere else that's what i'm trying to get to you now we know we all we all begin humanly as anti we all came anti-words the word says we're supposed to come like genesis 1 26 like brother dale's been preaching we're supposed to come by the spoken word of god right but we came the other way yes but you know what he's working right back to the spoken word of god because when you get the baptism of the holy ghost you get born again you get birthed like you had supposed to been birthed had there not been a fall you go right back to the spoken word of god let's read second thessalonians verse two everybody all right say amen amen all right second thessalonians let no man deceive you by any means now hold on there this is paul in thessalonica which is a city thinking greek yeah it's in greek in greece let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first so this is going to happen all right and that not baby not spirit but that man it has now grown into a man that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition who opposes and exalted himself oh by the way we see that that's them that's them satanists out there that sacrifice him uh remember go back to matthew so close until it would receive the very last so don't throw it out there who opposes and exalteth himself above all that is called god or that is worshipped so that he as god not like god he wants to be like god but right here somebody has put him in a place of exaltation they have exalted him so he that he as god sitteth in the temple of god showing himself that he is god remember you not that when i was yet with you i told you these things that's been 2 000 years ago and now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time because remember the mystery of iniquity was a spirit back in the first two three church ages but it's going to head up into a beast in our time not their time our time for the mystery of iniquity doth already work all right it's working it's a spirit only he who now letteth will let who god god's gonna let this thing go seven church ages until he the bride be taken out of the way and then shall that wicked be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of satan with all power see he's going to have power signs and wonders the bible says the wound the deadly wound he's die he dies and he resurrects and all these things he's he's got the power of the whole world what a great setup now to have a guy walk out and say if you'll come to me i'll get rid of this virus for you because i'm the head religious guy of the world okay don't hear much of that right now but don't worry even him who's coming is after the working of satan do you know right now you know the prophet of god told us 50 or 60 years ago that the catholic church will pay us out of debt amen and do you know right now we owe 21 trillion dollars every person in the united states of america owes 70 000 a piece out of 360 million people we owe 70 000 apiece we're all in debt 21 trillion dollars were in debt somebody's going to pay that off and when they pay listen when you pay somebody off like that what are you going to do if i come home and and poor brothers that's got kind of cockeyed one day and bought a 500 000 home with a 50 a week paycheck every how that might happen and he's so stressed with debt and all that stuff and i walk in and say what's that buddy wow i got i just had this weak moment i owe 400 000 i said hips here he pay it off whether he knows it or not as a christian as a christian there's no strings attached but as a non-christian as the devil incarnate there are strings attached i'm going to own this boy man for the rest of his life right so that's the way it's going to be we're going to oh we're not sure they're going to pay our debt off but we're going to owe more than that money to whoever pays our debt off thank god see we see these things we've already read the newspaper as brother dale said the prophecy went back in 1930 something that there would be a woman in the white house now nobody's believed that much nobody believed all these other things but they all came to pass so there must got to be some truth somewhere and even him whose coming is after the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders and with all the deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish look because it wasn't because they didn't receive the truth they didn't receive the love of the truth that they might be saved and for this cause god shall send them strong delusion glory what strong what is strong delusion strong delusion is 30 000 worldwide christian organizations 1200 in the united states alone different ways of seeing the bible god can't be that confused he didn't stand up and say i'm one of the ways i'm one of the truths no he said i am the way i am the truth i am the life and i'm going to come back inside of you and make you the truth we don't know what we've already got we're looking for something folks and we already got it looking for some great something some bug to fall on us one day and all of a sudden we don't cough anymore we feel like we're 20 years old now we will to change i promise you that brother there we're going to be 20 years old and feel it yeah glory the younger ones are like i said again the young kids are going what are y'all talking about right but the older people going wow yeah i'm gonna feel young again right zach's going i feel great now it's cause you're 20 years old right you just give yourself a little give yourself a little time you'll be getting up and shift just like i told you but god's going to send them a strong delusion look that they should believe a lie believe a lie yes now i'm reading bible it's not hearsay this is paul say they shall believe a lie they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved i don't read that but look for this cause god will send them strong delusion that they'll just believe listen go talk to people you talk to real true believe that believe their religion they'll just about kill you already what do you mean my mama's not walking in on the streets of gold what do you mean my mama's not sitting with jesus on the throne well lady sorry or man sorry that's that ain't bible so you just leave it alone right but look right here matthew 7 verse 21 i want you to read this right here because we've got 1200 different ways that the of of religious organizations in the united states now all 120 different ways not every one that sayeth unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day what day the day that's coming up lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils remember satan can't cast out satan so it had to be god doing the work they were so anointed but they were anointed on their spirit realm they were not anointed on this in their soul because look and in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works right and then will i profess unto them i never knew you and that word new is the same as a relationship between husband and wife that's not just i know no we never had a personal intimate relationship those people never had a personal intimate relationship with jesus christ depart i never knew you depart from me you that work iniquity what was talking about the mystery of iniquity was starting in the first church age you know what iniquity is it's reading the bible that you're supposed to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and you don't that's right that's iniquity that's what these 1200 major denominations in the united states that's what they're doing now you say you're talking about me no i'm talking about spirit remember not people we're talking about spirits i would say the pope is a good guy but one of these days according to the bible there's going to be a man of sin there's going to be a head guy a beast that's going to what rule the world that's right but he's going to take him to what a literal destruction amen let's read first john 2 verse 8. now we're still in the little john's remember we've been reading first john 4 this is first john 2. watch john now remember john's been on the alabamas he's seen the antichrist he's seen this beautiful church he's seen what's going on he's come back and he's telling us little children it is the last time and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come even now are there many antichrists whereby we know that it is the last time they went out from us but they were not of us for if they had been of us they would no doubt have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us but ye have an unction from the holy one and you know all things i have not written unto you because you know not the truth because you know it and that no lie is of the truth who is a liar but he that denies that jesus is the christ he is antichrist that denied the father and the son boy trinitarians are going like this whosoever denied the son the same hath not the father but see we know and we know that it's the same person so it doesn't bother us it's not it's not two separate people it's the same person amen but he that acknowledges the son hath the father also let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning if that which you have heard from beginning shall remain in you you shall continue in the son and in the father and this is what the promise that he has promised us what even eternal life all right let's go to first corinthians 2. he said by the way why are you saying or why are you against i'm not against these denominations you understand that i'm not i'm against their teaching because their teaching is anti right their teaching is anti-words somebody has got to have the truth and somebody's got to have error right okay and you got to decide and i brethren when i came to you this is paul to the corinthians came not with excellency of speech or wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of god for i determine not to know anything among you save jesus christ and him crucified in other words i i don't want to hear all this other stuff you're talking about i i just know jesus christ now remember look paul was unique in that paul almost spoke to us as if he was right there with jesus the whole time jesus was on earth and he never saw him one time right not one time did he see jesus so what he had to take was the old testament by the holy ghost filter that he had and bring us into the new testament and show us jesus christ out of the old testament right and i was with you in weakness for i determined not to know anything among you saved jesus christ and him crucified and i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom i wished i could do that to keep most of y'all awake but in demonstration of the spirit of power that your faith look should not stand in the wisdom of man but in the power of god howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to naught watch this i like this but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery now listen they asked jesus says why in the world are you speaking to us in parable and jesus answered them he said to hide it from the wise and prudent the people that think they know it all them 1200 different ones and all the different ones that think they know it all i'm saying this to hide it from them but what did jesus say though but reveal it unto babes such as we'll learn amen but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden mis-wisdom which god ordained before the world unto our glory which none of the princes of this world knew kind of narrows it down a little bit doesn't it for had they known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory you know he's talking about the prince of the world he's talking about that organization that was on earth when jesus was there if they hadn't known who he was they'd have never crucified him they were standing there looking at their messiah that's how blind they were but you know what god let them believe a lie and be down by it so look i'm going to sum all this up right here we've come from a spirit of antichrist now we've come to a person we've come to the end time where there's 1200 different denominations in america 30 000 across the world and we're looking at what we call the message of the hour which there's probably 1200 different ideas in it i'll say amen because i know they several so what is truth god had to send god had to do something he promised us that we would make it amen he promised us there'd be a bride he promised us there'd be someone that makes it he promised us on earth in saint john 17 he said lord sanctify them through thy truth that word is true they're in the world but they're not of the world they're like me and they're going to make it amen glory there's a group that's going to make it now all the other groups have died we're left but what are we going to do lord right at the end of the old testament this is what he tells us malachi 4 verse 5 says behold i will send you elijah the prophet even send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord you say oh wow that's got to be john the baptist no because it wasn't the great and dreadful day of the lord and it wasn't down here unless i smote the earth with a curse that's been 2 000 years ago and john told us who he was in the bible he said i am the voice of one crying in the wilderness malcolm 3 and the different ones hey so he wasn't mount kai four he wasn't the fourth coming of elijah he was the third elijah elisha elijah elijah elisha john the baptist they had to be in fourth one on malachi 4 and then one of the two witnesses which is moses and elijah that go to the jews i've told you many times before just look in their tradition the jewish tradition they are looking for elijah to show up why can't we realize elijah had to show up we had to have a gentile elijah to show up and then that elijah is going to go as spirit of elijah number five is going to the jews because they're already looking for him every year at that set their sedar they set in front of them a cup because they believe elijah's got to show up before the messiah shows up well he did it was john the baptist they missed that one they missed the fourth one too because he was to the gentiles he wasn't to them but who was he too behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and look there's many people in the world many denominations read this and they think that this is the spirit of elijah a personal pronoun right he shall turn the heart not hearts one heart right he shall turn the heart of what of the fathers to the children which was john the baptist from the old fathers of the old testament looking for jehovah right right right to where john stands on the shores of jordan and says behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world he br he brings children into being to begin the baby form of the new testament but from that baby form brothers and sisters from between that and and this right here there's been 30 000 different ways that they think it's going to happen right yes we know god's not that confused so what's he going to do he's going to send us elijah the prophet before the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children what pentecostal babies that had most good truths but not all of it pentecostal babies to what back to the faith of the fathers where there was zero denomination in these church ages amen that's what you and i have been brought unless i come and smite the earth right with the curse this earth is cursed but now remember there's only one group of people at this moment of time looking for elijah to show up and that's the jews this elijah that we had in the end time he's already gone off the scene but if he did nothing else he brought us the hidden mystery that had been hid before the foundation of the world that man has buried man buried it because jesus said by your tradition you've made the word of god none effective now i'm sure confidence is that's what he hated so bad caiaphas was looking at him and went what do you mean man i wash the pots like i'm supposed to in the old testament i put four or seven rams on top of the altar and i i sacrifice seven bullocks and i i do everything i'm supposed to do in the old testament but they were off somewhere because he said by your tradition by your denominational idea you have made the word of god of none of facts and that's what's happened in this time how can god be so confused to have 1200 different ways of looking at this one bible just in our borders of 50 states of the united states god can't be that confused so you pray you pray that god will send you the truth amen apart from all the other ideas of the world amen you pray because you know what we probably still do have some ideas of our own but paul said musicians come paul said now we have the mind of christ and i believe what those seals brought us was not i mean the mind of christ has been is connected to the new birth right if you have the new birth you have the mind of christ but you and i have not let it work like it's supposed to work by my traditions i've made the word of god of none effect by my traditions of not believing what god's already said by my traditions of believing not believing that by his stripes i'm healed but we got to keep believing and keep believing and keep believing it he that overcometh not he that lay down and just give up he that overcometh shall inherit all things the bible tells us amen let's stand to our feet it started as a baby folks but we're not dealing with a baby you know who was it um oh what were we talking about the other day somebody was teaching somebody how to play oh lily somebody was teaching literally how to play checkers well lily's a baby lily's four or five and the 21 year old man teaching her kid was teaching her how to play checkers well now if me and joe played that guy he might not have a chance but he was playing with a baby the baby didn't know didn't know about capturing and making kings and how you can move about you know what i'm saying you understand what i'm saying but that guy did because he was 21 years old he was an adult he was harder to beat satan is harder to beat because he's got the tactics and everything that you and i have for the end time he's standing right beside of it and he's and he's even today i believe he's probably laughing and saying huh he thinks there's 1200 different denominations he said i'm standing right there in their church whoa oh that brings it home doesn't it but any doctrine outside of the pure word of god is the devil it is antichrist amen any idea we have is anti-word any idea so we that's why the idea when paul says we have the mind of christ you get ideas in your what in your mind we need to quit having our why old wives fables and get back to the word of god there's a song now on the radio that is if he said it i believe it i doubt it i said i doubt it the bible you know the song is if he said it i believe it if he said it i believe it yeah okay let's point to some of these places in here and see if they believe it but how about you and me that's been shown the truth that knows what that scripture says and somebody says you believe that we go yep sure do and i'll tell you exactly where that came from we're not know-it-alls but we do have the mind of christ i believe we do i believe we are known we the secret hidden mysteries of god has been made known to the end time bride and that's what satan has that's what satan has had sorry in his corner is that darkness of revelation he's had that in his corner because god has not revealed it to luther wesley yeah pentecost but he's revealed it to me and you that's why he hates it because you know what it exposes him shows exactly where he is shows exactly what he's doing and until we get out of here he's right here he's dealing in my head right now he's dealing in your head right now he's dealing with us but he can't deal with the heart because you know what we got to say look whatever you do devil what's down inside i know what truth is i know what truth is i don't have to be swayed by 1200 different ideas this is it or not this is it or or brother right we just go home eat drink and be married the bible says this is it young people there is nothing beside this word of god nothing oh yeah we have to live our human life sure we have to do all the different things that we do but when you take it back to this and it's contrary to this then just be careful just be careful with it okay just be careful with it let's sing a song god bless you let's sing this remember all these that are sick satan's on the rampage we're getting a revival started and the devil's starting one itself on calvary we have a need today those precious for me you believe that for all my sins my sickness oh when i need healing i just claim those precious blood stains do you really do you know that that man went to calvary just for you just for you [Music] and it's not the chemistry of the blood it's the life that was in that blood [Music] i just claimed those precious blood stains sing it one more time oh and i claim the blood that jesus shared all calvary thank you lord those precious worship just for me for all my sins my sickness and my pain think about it healing i just claim those prayers [Music] amen you love the lord amen this thing reach out and touch the lord just one time that's okay reach out and touch the lord as he passes you will find he's not too busy to hear your hearts cry oh he is [Music] they sing it one more time and literally reach out and touch the lord as he passes by you will find he's do you have a need reach as he goes by reach out and touch the lord as he passes by and you will find he's not too busy to [Music] [Applause] reach [Music] [Music] she said if i could but touch the hem of that man's garment i don't need to hug him i don't need to grab a hold of his feet i just need to touch him as he walks by just reach out and jesus turned around and said who touched me because strength had went from him not that people were physically touching him hundreds of people were physically touching him but she touched something that no one had touched before she touched that virtue that healing power and she just reached and touched that garment and bless her heart you know what kind of issue she had she couldn't go to church she had 12 years of bleeding [Music] we think we have problems sometimes 12 years she was unclean the bible said according to the old testament she was unclean for 12 years couldn't go to church because of her issue but what did she say the bible said in her heart she perceived that the issue had stopped and jesus said who touched me and then i believe the the crowd parted back and there she stood he said sister by your faith you have touched the master you have touched something [Music] that no man has touched before and that's a healing power and virtue you know jesus was real at that time this was not a story this was a real what happened in the bible he was a real man standing there and she was a real woman you know what he's just as real today as he was back then he's actually more real because he's walking in me and you all over the world amen and you don't know who you've touched you don't know who you spoke to you don't know who you've many times just give them a pat on the back and say god bless you and you're going through an issue in your life or a problem in your life and somebody walks by and lord how many times brother joe if somebody said i sure appreciate it i needed that phone call why you had an unction you had an unction from god to call so-and-so don't pass that by because as the song says reach out and touch the lord you know if she had not touched the hem of his garments she would have not got healed because they said she had been the doctors for all that many years and spent all of her money trying to get healed by a doctor on this earth but when the great physician walked by the only prescription he gave her was is by my stripes according to isaiah by my stripes you're healed he hasn't even been to calvary yet but he was given a scripture that had already been written in the old testament that she believed oh my just reach out and touch him today one more time reach out and touch the lord as he passes [Music] he didn't just keep walking that day no he stopped and turned around and said lady you're healed reach out and touch the lord i see listen we are getting our day of visitation god is visiting his people for the last time because he's going to visit us and then he's going to israel and when he goes to israel i don't care see there's another denominational idea that you can be left behind and you can be saved during the seven years of tribulation which there's no such thing see all those old tales those are just tales they're not true they're lies but it's been fabricated over the years for us to believe that but they ain't gonna be when you're left behind you're behind we're going in a rapture there'll be no more gentiles saved after we leave the bible says the door to the gentile church will be closed they'll be weeping wailing gnashing of teeth god's going to go to israel and save 144 000 and then we're going to meet him back down here after a wonderful wedding supper amen remember practice if you're going to sing at what's not service practice here after service today i'll get with sister trudy collins and different ones practice your songs no service on wednesday service on thursday night at eight o'clock we'll have service from 8 to 12 and at midnight we'll take communion and we'll take it in order and we don't have to all bunch up together but thank you for um all the things like i said you've done this during this holiday season all the cards and the gifts and the letters and and the different things but i've always told you the greatest gift we could ever give anybody brother they'll be in our pastor the greatest gift is to live what he preaches you can't wrap that gift up you can't buy it with money i love that sermon brother brown preached without without money and without price you can't buy this it has no price on it the price has already been paid was paid 2 000 years ago at calvary what are we doing take it and go forward remember that though service at eight o'clock thursday night brother william borla want to be here and then starting sunday we'll have our regular two services ten and at two between the services the ones that we call out if you need that list again i got it right here you all stay and eat in the fellowship hall and me and brother terence and and brother richard to go out and eat and like i said before if you want to go out and eat and bring it to the car but just those people we call will be able to sit in the in the fellowship hall and eat together as a family so just pray that this thing you know it's who knows if it gets worse whatever but we got to be like daddy said the other day we got to start believing we we got to start believing now not like i told you let's don't go jump in a pool of it use wisdom but fear hath torment if you keep fearing everything that satan's just going to keep laying it on you fear half torment you remember that but you know what jesus every time he's every time he or an angel come to talk to somebody what's the first thing he said fear not fear not fear not why because he don't have fear there's no fear in jesus christ let's bow our heads to heavenly father thank you for this day that you give us not this 24-hour day but this day of the lord that you give us like john on the isle of patmos was in the lord's day and you revealed all those things to to john lord what a day it's going to be when he get we get to literally meet those people paul john arenas peter all the apostles and all the ones from the old testament elijah and and and uh david and all the ones lord we're gonna literally meet those people and live with them for an etern eternity what a privileged people we are lord where we're we're not a part of sure we're all part of american history or different history on the earth but lord we've got a genealogy that starts before the foundation of the world in your mind you had all this thought out lord and now we are going through it on the earth lord truly you do know what tomorrow holds so i pray lord that you would just give us a little bit of insight on that lord of what's going on that way lord that we can we can trust you we we believe you that we know your words correct but we're all human beings and we all have problems and issues that we deal with but father you told us to look to you you even told the jews you said if you can look to my temple i'll deliver you so father we know that there is no temple here on the earth but we know that you're tabernacled in a group of people and that your word is going forth in that group of people so we look to that word lord the author and finisher of our faith lord come on the scene lord take care of all these ones that are sick father and heal them lord we ask that you keep us all safe lord and as we come back together on thursday night lord just be with us and keep us as a people and as a church as a bride lord around
