I'm one of the workers out there a while ago we said call me over there and he said no um just say a prayer for me tonight if you would so you know as we pray just remember one of them that wanted to be prayed for you know that the Lord be blessing father we thank you for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for all things and you give them to us freely so we we just Lord we just thank you and just Praise Your Great Name and we ask you Lord the man asked for us to say a special prayer for him tonight Lord and we ask you to just reach down and touch him and be with him Lord and take care of him give him whatever he has need of Lord most of all give him salvation in your soul and Lord we pray that you would just come now and be in the service tonight with us and that you would bless us and guide each and every one forgive our sins cleanse us and let us walk in the light of Your Love Lord just as we read your word you come and speak to her hearts in Jesus name so we'll go back and read on Ephesians now because we're going to be picking up some things and you know going on a little bit and you know I was going to read every service but it just we just read so much of it so look Ephesians 1 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted into Below in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace we're in here to mount it toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to the good pleasure which he hath purposed to himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together and want all things in Christ for which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the Council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory he first trusted in Christ in whom he also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation and whom also after that you believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory and let's go over to second Corinthians 5. verse 1. but we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens for in this we groan earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from Heaven if so be that being clothed we should not be found naked for we that are in this Tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unburdened not far that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be slaughtered up of life now he that hath brought us for the self-same thing is God who also has given us given unto us the earnest of the spirit you may be seated Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now we'll get to that verse in a little while you know to speak a little bit about it from Corinthians and uh you know I'm trying my best to get a point across to you and and uh you know I want to make sure you understand what I'm trying to say because I believe that the real part of you is your soul because that's you right that's the real you right you said with now the body in the spirit now with the body of spirit and we're a unit we you know we would have to have that but even after this this body is rotten away in the ground and the spirit goes back to God who gave it or whatever steal the soul of an individual will live on and and even if you're an unregenerated your soul is where you're at waiting the Judgment Day and the things you know so then it's the real you now the bride of Christ don't have no judgment day so we know where they go and souls under the altar to cry how long not to avenge our blood but to how long in other words come on you on Earth and let's get this thing on on and of course they can uh have a connection in some way to You and I by the faith that they were all right now she's in the soul of man is that part of you that will even be will even continue after your body and spirit is dissolved or whatever you want to say about it gone or destroyed or whatever all right because the soul is that part of you that God begins to work on now just to say these few things to to get make sure you follow me because that's what he begins to work on us in the New Birth the new birth is not in your body it is not in your spirit he deals with those situations and Realms that we talk about but the real part of you where God begins to deal is in that Soul now we'll get back to more so if you will study souls in prison and you know it'll help you especially maybe the first 10 15 pages you know I've sold in prison and then we'll get back to it a little later on but as mortal beings we seem to want to put more emphasis upon our body you know right because that's the part of us that we claim to be real or whatever you know tangibles or whatever it is but just remember that what's inside of us is more real than the body that we're living in amen because as I said it lives on even after we're gone now whether you're saved or not right it will go it will live on somewhere until a Day of Reckoning you know of the shoulders or the Rapture comes for the bride of Christ but now you what God begins or they're said to work on that show because that's where salvation's at it's not in your body it's not in your spirit it's in your soul all right and that's the part God begins to deal with you so that's the real part of you I mean something that you can't even uh show to somebody maybe right but yet it's more real than all that can be seen amen because it's the real you right that's where you live at that's where your see our problem was that we were sold into sin in the the domain of Satan and being sold into the domain of Satan then uh right around and said those angels they give us the nature right all right and they pervert our nature we started out right because God created us perfect not Eternal right Perfect Right made us right Body Spirit and soul as much as possible of the body but the spirit and soul being a perfect creation because God can't create something imperfect I keep emphasizing that because I I want us to hold on to that point all right but see then God comes down and he starts to deal with us now here's where our problem is he begins to deal with us in the soul but yet you can make Christians in the realm of as we call it the word Christian using it in the realm of anointed ones you know and look at the things that are done look at the the way man goes and and all so you can become a a religious person right and just be if the prophet says you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every day of your life on your spirit and dying go down right still be lost see that way then I believe the biggest portion of the religious world are religion religious in their Spirit realm right yes sir amen I don't believe they're religious in their soul you know what I'm saying that's so dark that's right but see some way you cut off allowing that soul to have control and then that's what brother Brown says people do he says they'll they'll give all their calls and they'll they'll go out among the congregation you know or something or tell somebody call them out you know now Gary you you need to get an altar you know hey and right around says you'll make that person a twofold child of hell that's right he said God is harder the next time to get to it right I know my sister I've told you many times she came to me in the church and Samuel you need to go to the altar you're an ojc Huber dare said he didn't have a chance to be saved well I thought more of his salvation and him never claiming anything I did hers I'm just honest you know but the point I'm getting at is we do like the Philippian Jailer said you know Paul and him you know there and repeating him they're in prison you know and uh when he saw something Supernatural take place all right right and he knew about them being a Christian he knew why they were in there right so then when something Supernatural took place he said what must I do to be saved okay now I gave you some quotes from Brother random that you know to me it is very fitting because like I said you you go out and you you talk to people and you and you you try to you really embarrassing them on that blessed God I felt led all right you're gonna have to argue with your Prophet about it not me I'm not going to argue with you at all I felt led to go talk to them was it your leadership or was it the Holy Spirit now I'm not against you if God told you right but I'm just telling you what your Prophet said he says you make it harder for that person to come to the Lord in other words right my coach you embarrassing you put them in a situation and they won't come back to church or something because why because you're going to talk to him again well you don't believe in talking to people now there's way in mind and run it all you want to talk to people about the Lord but don't embarrass them that's right don't get right out in the big old group gang call it you need you know the Lord's neither will you you need to come to the Lord you need salvation right in front of everybody go to him privately three right you didn't want nobody to do you that away they may have but you didn't like it but that's what I'm talking about see we talk about salvation we talk about the new birth yeah and it can only be the first of the show right and you can fill a church up full of people and it'll still all be lost right well you don't believe in going out and winning the people to the Lord yes I do but your Prophet said it I didn't he said a life lived is a greater testimony than all of your words he said because your life hinders so much I can't hear your words because your life is in the way that was where it was with me when I was 18 years old before it even was even converted in a Baptist Church one because people wouldn't have said they come to me and they'd say you need to get saved I said I live a better life your Deacon board does I wasn't hateful I'm telling the truth all right but see we get in the way so the Philippian Jailer said what must we do to be saved look what your Prophet said this was off in Hebrews chapter 2 part 1 and 57 825 today we got so many things you have to do now watch it now this is your prophet today we got so many things you have to do have to turn new pages you don't want people turning you pages you have to do this and do that in order to get saved he's saying what we we try to do see I thank the Philippian Jailer when this Jailer asked Paul what must I do to be saved into being you or I we'd have told him the things he ought not to do you ought to quit smoke drinking you ought to quit your gambling your gambling you ought to quit this you ought to quit off to quit that Paul never told him that he just told him the things he just told him the things he ought to do now what was it believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and I shall be saved all right now that's what we do somebody comes to church want to be saved where do we start telling them you need to quit this you need to quit that you need to stop doing that you need to start doing this now show it to me in the Bible where that's at well I just feel led all right that's between you and the Lord and I think a lot of the people's leadership is their own leadership man Lord tells you to go deal with somebody healed in on the other end amen that's what the prophet said all right watch what he said turning northward 61 129. like a Philippian Jailer that night when he said what must I do to be saved well we will we do we tell him what not to do you got to quit doing this you got to quit going over there you got to quit doing this he never asked what he had to quit doing doing he asked what he could what he could he do to be saved right all told and no misunderstanding words he said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved that's all get the faith of God back into people so that they'll know what to do and how to act not say come over and join our group in other words come in the message you believe the message you gotta believe this message if you're gonna be saved is that what's been put in most of your faces right come over and join that group just get them back to God God will do the rest of it of it get them into the kingdom oh Finance Jehovah Jireh 1961 209. you know the thing of it today when a sinner comes to the Lord we don't treat them like Paul did when the Philippian Jailer said what must I do to be saved now what would we say today you got to quit smoking you got to quit drinking you got to quit doing this that wasn't what he asked he said what must I do to be saved and Paul told him believe on the Lord Jesus Christ leave on the Lord Jesus Christ not come join our congregation and stand up before the church and say this and we'll sprinkle you immerse you or whatever you want to do our way and if if if you're not in our church then that wasn't it he said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou and thy house shall be saved amen all right if you can believe for yourself you can believe for your house or also amen have enough faith in God to believe for yourself then believe for your children also amen that same faith will save your children that saved you if you just keep praying God will answer prior don't worry just ask him and believe it and get it anchored in your heart and just keep moving on that's the way it's done the house 1961. 808 did you notice now did you notice you and I today and most all ministers are so forth we're always trying to tell a feller what not to do now he put himself to her so you argue with him that way we'd say now quit you smoking quit your line quit your Stephen quit this or that that wasn't what the man asked he he didn't say what do I have to quit doing to be saved he said what must I do to be saved see we try to tell them what they must stop doing see and say well I must do this that or the other no that isn't the question what must I do not what must I stop doing but you just do what you're supposed to do you know what and all the rest that will take care of itself you're lying and stealing or drinking and gambling and doing the things that's evil it'll stop when you do that Paul answered the question what must I do to be saved believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and die in thy house will be saved and it's not going to save your house because you believe right because you believe that's right they must come to their own salvation but if they're watching you and you're trying to tell them the wrong way to get to God how can they be saved so get to God first it's my brother Adele Don't Preach like all these other preachers you know I learned screaming about the clothes you wear the things you do get born to end it'll take care of that that's right amen if you're doing it you're not born again right well you're telling me I'm lost right I'm telling you you lost amen that's right what else you want me to say oh that's going on what am I tell me I'm lost will it Bruce you're lost then because of the attitude all right you get upset about somebody saying something that proves you wrong all right which see salvation starts in the soul of man when we deal on the body and spirit to try to get people saved we think it's because we get them to church because we get them to believe the message because we get them to baptized correctly because we get them to quote a Creed no let's will and do it but is that salvation salvation must start in the real you in the soul get your soul right the body and spirit is going to obey right but around said it's impossible to get a holy ghost for a woman to put on purpose you put them on you're proven yourself you need salvation right what don't you think we're to live good no I told you that over and over don't think we're gonna live good I think we're to be born again amen the life will take care of itself amen but you can quit smoking you can quit drinking quit everything you're going to do that don't save you because you're trying to deal with the body and the spirit of a person something you can see right the church seen this what must we do to be saved start with the inward part of you let that inward part of you it's real right there is where God's deal is well I believe the message brother Dale amen I quit this and I quit dead amen then you see people turn around and going back right and doing it again right must not have been delivered right and that's right because they got born again ain't gonna go back and do it again nope that's right you mean you don't never make mistake every day every hour your Prophet did too so he's the one that said it with the mistakes of a Christian is not the sin of a sinner right it's mistakes of a human being problems troubles getting caught in the devil's trap right but quickly repent amen why because down inside of there if something condemns you you know what I'm talking about the body and spirit of you you go find you another church a little okay for you to do that right amen and this message you got to imagine divorce problem just go down around just get in there you know connect up your little internet things and listen You'll find you somebody to tell you okay well brother Dale you won't do it no I'm not unless God tells me but his word tells me whether or not I'm okay but you can do anything you want to be a believer in this message right typical just in body and spirit it's not in my soul David set my soul on the fact of the old God now he could do that without the new birth what would be our problem with anyone you mean just because you wouldn't get caught doing what you do or something that you will go ahead and do it but you're going to keep from doing it because you're afraid you get caught right you can hit a thing happen one time um Dean's son's daughter uh son's wife and uh you know I just preach on this and I just said it one day the pope had she happened to be here I said if you want that drink you know in fact you can't stand it without it you might as well go and drink it brother would you give somebody a drink man come up with a what do you call it DTS is that the word for what are you going to do for him the only thing you can do is give him a little house y'all want to get him over it till he'd go somewhere else out well you sure know I know it so anyhow the lady said I told her husband said I want a beer I want something to drink and he said but honey we're not supposed to drink we're trying to do right she said you heard brother Dale he said if I wanted I might as well go ahead and drink it well she took what I said literally which was it was a truth you know you can keep yourself from doing wrong right because you're afraid of getting caught right and that's what ninety percent of Christianity does they're afraid of getting caught right or like I said they'll find them another church to go to that tells them it's okay come on they got homosexual preachers and everything else around the country they'll tell you everything's okie dokie but listen what must we do to be saved repeating everyone and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost why if your repentance is genuine now it's easy to say I'm sorry go baptize me if you're offendency to genuine amen but that's where we miss it actually we look at it and we think well now I've done that but the Lord didn't save me it don't say immediately it says and you shall right and that's right you shall so if in the time of the shell which could be like me two years Amen Brother Gary one year like if you turn and go back what you prove you see salvation is in the soul amen because that's the real you that's what I've been driving at amen that's where salvation begins he's in that soul man we'll get around to it later where it says it's the earnest of our inheritance right you know the prophet said your soul is not complete yet it's only got the earnest right amen he's got to have a growth development it's got to have a I'm going on and that's kind of what we're going to be dealing with tonight all right but do you understand somebody comes along and they say well you know I want to be a Christian well come to our church right yep all right get baptized correctly oh that's well and good the worst of salvation right right that's right I believe in Deliverance I don't believe in quitting right you quit smoking you're gonna go right back and start smoking again amen you quit drinking you're going to go right back and drink again right why because you can't control it the devil is stronger than you are go to the Lord is it Lord I don't want to do that may you help me and watch you come on the scene help me Lord but I don't want to do it all right I want to be delivered amen you know that's why I believe in the total Deliverance amen what we need to do then listen is to get the one inside of us and the quitting will be on because of him well how do I do that repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ release the sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost all right he said well I've done that all right I wanted to flip you in jail what must I do to be saved believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and I shall be saved now that believing dire is not just well I believe my brother around says you go down there to get a drunk going down the road and he's you know you ask him so if you believe Jesus Christ get born again all right man that's what I'm trying to say because that's where the birth takes place he's in the soul amen amen see we try to conquer the body right it's honorable to quit things but run around City women said you can have a dress drag in the ground yeah yeah ain't no righteousness man but you get bored again it'll take care of everything that's my brother Dale's lucky is because I know what salvation is well you're just not a good pastor I'll agree with you not just what I am you tell me whether I'm right or wrong right see we try to deal with people to get them to us to a situation A Doctrine and Prophet what did he say he said I don't believe we're getting them to Christ he said I don't believe we're getting them to Christ because we're getting them to a doctor him that's great well then brother there you think it's all right and he's going to do that yeah you lost all right don't tell me you're saved and doing it you're lost well then I don't let you know plain enough where I stand you're going to tell me but I can't help it I do this I do that I can't help it you're lost wait a minute you need to be born again that New Birth has to begin in the show now watch that as we go along in the message see that new birth begins in the soul that's right that's why did you know the way that I believe it see then when you're born again in your soul is your theophany which is an upward going right before then you've got a Celestial form you can call it a theophany just don't carry it on over to a theophthy of Eternity right because you can't have an eternal Center basically for The Sinner in theophany lining up for a Christian Realm all right but you see just get born again and take care of itself in The Soul Man see big get saved first and get yourself saved and then apply it to your family don't know if I could just get my kids in church and then you lay out don't talk to me that's right too old I'm sorry you see a mom and daddy and they're goofing off and they don't go to church but every so often they just go sometimes special events or maybe every once in a while when you think you need to well I know you know what the kid's going to be the same way you know that kids don't have to overcome his mom and daddy to be able to go to church all the time because his mom and daddy says it's okay yeah we don't have to go to church ever service not that Lord have more amen especially in this day that's right you know in this day we ought to be having seven days a week Services amen oh well we'll see there you prove your loss right you don't want to come to church seven days you would sure go to the world I'm selling days and worldly events see then we prove where's your digging at we think salvation is right here well I don't go out and do them things now I like what the the colored ladies hit she said I ain't what I want to be and ain't what I want to be something like this but ain't what it used to be that's right she coughing somewhere something took over and she'd come she'd made a move amen all right that's salvation you got troubles Drive says you get borned again he said the devil turned over a gun he's got on you you know what you know what fool you before then so you see the world you want to steal me especially in this day right right when we're dealing with the change of this body right this is not the age to just go to church be good right it's the age of the Redemption of the body amen so we got a problem struggle right but what you gonna do is quit but now what's your point of what I'm trying to get to we've been over and over about the soul of God being the real you whether you're a sinner or a saint it's still the real you and it lives on no matter what right even after death all right see the sinner has a place to go to we have a place to go to right but let me just ask you something you know that when you was a sinner and I was a sinner you know what we was doing you really know what we were doing as sinners we were building us a house to go to a tabernacle right right yep yep come on that's why you loved it but you were not building a house now and out on the on the ground out there somewhere you know that ain't the Tabernacle that Paul was speaking of you know it's this Tabernacle amen our Dwelling Place we serve the devil right amen you know no problems with it I've watched them at General Motors I watched them in the world and the things of people and they come to work man you know what I wanted to do I know what I mean I wanted to take two big old cans and just crush them together see because they've been out all night drunk you've been there you wouldn't want nobody crashing the can around you would you but you know what next night you'll go right back and do it again you know what you're doing you're building your house to go to yep that's what I mean by the downward pool the prophet said one is going downward one is going upward right all right now I thought we believed as Christians now I'm getting down to something so listen that Jesus said in John 14 I go to prepare place for you and if I go to prepare a place for you I'll come and receive you again unto myself now where did he go is he up in heaven when Hammers and Nails building a supply well now why does everybody think your soul is up in heaven or you see often is up in heaven right right that's what the basics of the message believe that your theophany is up in the oven somewhere but I thought Jesus went up and come right back inside of the person am I wrong you know Am I Wrong Jesus said I go to prepare a place for you you know he's building this place we build our own going down right right we supply all the material the devil needed amen Amen to build us a good house to live in down in hell all right all right A.D sugar honey anything you want to call it but it was a downward pull the prophet said but he said you get born again it starts an upward pull amen why because Jesus is building us a place to go to but where's he at inside of you all right where because you're in your body is he just an anointing upon your spirit or is the new birth in the soul see him the Christian is different from the center because in the center we would we were doing everything ourselves to go down we were trying to you know that said you got to go over the cross to get to hell that's right he said it's hard to go to hell because you had to get over the crowd so we sure did love the world didn't we but now we have someone inside of us that is building us a place to go to building National if we die right amen we have one lady right here's what we read in Corinthians feet Jesus Christ came back on the day of Pentecost you remember the other day now into what now in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the soul of God came back on the death Pentecost to start building us a place to go amen so then it's all the building that's on the inside right amen right the workers on the inside now like I said if we act out here in these bodies and spirits and things like that if we act like the devil then the devil's on the inside so forget it amen that's why I said I don't believe in being good I believe in getting born again and let God come and live in our hearts and alive it'll take care of us but I can keep myself from doing wrong right amen yes I can keep myself from doing wrong see he came back into the man in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost to give the new birth listen now which is not the birth of the body our spirit but it's the birth and the Soul see then your soul is your theophany amen now that we read it that's only the earnest we'll get to that on another message go then write a random old paragraph 80 or page 80 of the Hebrew Book and I tried my best to get you to see for 40 years he said your soul is your theology no no no no no we got one up yonder well is Jesus up there working or where is he working right man that's right now according to the Bible he's gone to prepare a place for us he's up there working I even thought your Prophet said that the future home will be built because of your desires that's right is that true he said some people like mountains some people like valleys he's a little bit though thank you Lord God it's according to your desire he said what about if you could build a house you know that's your wife you know you could come and say well honey why do you want here why you won't die and it's just to all be there he said but he's going to prepare a place to live way on a greater needle house all right see when you're born again you start an upward pull instead of a downward pull in the same Soul right amen people of the message they say oh we get a new soul remember the quote get a New Soul was before the prophet or when the prophet was bringing it Body Spirit our body Soul spirit amen see we do get a new Spirit right Ezekiel says 36. you don't say we get in your soul but that was the Two Sold options you should get a New Soul then I hear it and the people of the message and they said they called it chains of the Soul all kind of things come off of that you know of doctrines but it's the same message for the rest of it wasn't your soul that died right he said it was the nature of your soul you said so was the nature that's what I told the man up in Jeff one time sitting there talking to him I said but around and said the nature of your soul is God if you're born again if not it's of the world he said how could a nature have a nature I said argue with the prophet he said this nature of your soul that's what I was trying to get you to see and we say the souls just the nature of spirit no it's not just the nature of the spirit right Satan took our soul and gave us a nature his own right God by the new birth comes inside and drive that nature out read future home page 15. the unclean Spirit goes out amen God came down and drove out that unclean Spirit right and it comes and dwells in that soul making our soul Eternal I didn't bring it on things but but I said don't get it on the next mansion He said that makes us as persons together you know you got no problem saying that God in your soul made you persons together your soul you remember the other day when we were bringing out said Adam was body and spirit and then just put a soul in there he'd be gone don't destroy the soul only God can do that the soul is a real you and God starts right in that soul mother New Birth all right clean Spirit out amen and covet and dwelling in see now when that unclaimed Spirit goes out we get new desires that's where the trouble when the unclaimed Spirit goes out of a man that gets new desires right see everybody say it then I'm saved because my desires change I used to love this but I don't anymore he said well when you preach I I can't find out whether I'm saved or lost well it gives you good reason to pray amen amen all right talk to God about it amen until he shows you what the truth is see salvation then starts in the soul making that Soul Eternal by the new birth and what is the new birth come on how many years have I been preaching to you what is a new birth the birth of the word amen you said what's the baptism now you can have the baptism about the daily life die and go to hell yeah that's right the new birth is the birth of the word he was the word right and if it's his soul coming and giving our soul eternal life it was he was his soul his theophany come on how many quotes do you need it is so histiochneous person of his being went to hell to preach to the soul in prison how many do you need to believe your Prophet is the one that said it Jesus's soul went to hell and preached to those souls in prison amen he didn't go down there as a spirit form to just look at him and they didn't even know he was around they knew who he was that's right as soon as you birthday is the birth of the word according to Romans 10 7 Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word amen so how do you start the New Birth by hearing the word oh I was just sitting out somewhere and all at once I just got saved man that's you've got to hear the word first you show me anybody in the Bible who's ever saved without hearing the word first right Philippian Jaguar what must I do they have any calls what must we do they heard the word it convicted them right that's right that's why a lot of people are not saved they're never convicted they're convinced that they need to do something else but around says you become sympathetic that's what a lot of people do they become sympathetic see God then by way of the new birth brains you and I part of his own life just like we did and covered the last message of 126 and 27 with Genesis that Adam received a part of God's life amen amen and his soul exists theophany he received part of Eternal part of God's life you and I receive part of God's life see the empathy is the soul of God or in other words the only form of God that's eternal I'm talking about an eternal fee off me I'm not talking about now just there's somebody to go to I'm talking about an eternal fee off me amen and there's only one Eternal right all right now if I was you I take a little pencil right in front of me show me the right notes right down right now there's only one eternal right but it can't be a whole lot of eternals the prophet said we start eternal life right here in the altar salvation there that's right we went through that now watch that's number six on your notes um paragraph 70 of manifest the sons of God he said you begin your eternal life right here at the altar amen that's where you begin eternal life right here talk now this is one I really like look at number seven on your notes paragraph 88 who is this male Chesney you left the Whirl in all of them things what did he say he said you heard look what's on the line he said you heard from your theosity right well I got a telephone call and the Lord called me from heaven and told me that I had some uh what did he tell you you had if you heard from you theophany you would have to have some form of connection right amen did you get that yeah I just now got it so I hope you did you have to have some form of connection sure then if it's not connected to the eternal life in you where it's connected to eternity can only come to Eternity right all right so keep in mind what we're saying that eternal life see then the real you at the new birth begins to develop by you eating the word and that started your upward agree I wrote it like this you say all that sounds so good brother Dale but I thought my theophany was up in heaven hey so now let's while we're at Dad if that's what you're thinking come on down to number eight on your notes expectations and look where your Prophet says that were now in Heavenly places is that what the scripture says in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus already resurrected sitting in Heavenly places so now if you're saying that it's in Heavenly places then you're not saying it's your soul is in heaven right it hasn't left the body it's in the body right and if it's in the body then Heavenly places must have come here amen that's right that's right are we waiting to get to heaven to get eternal life or does our eternal life begins here see we can't even believe that and then turn around and say oh boy bless God one of these days this body is going to be changed some more we gonna do it you say yeah but you just gotta start eternal life in the soul I don't know about that but why not I thought we believed in Jesus Christ that the message I just previously preached and she said you enjoyed that having a nurse guess these times righteousness and peace push together in Jesus Christ and then by the new birth it's in you and me right right Heaven and Earth has kissed each other because you're not you United with him in the new birth that's right are you following me see I thought that we were already by the new birth resurrected and sitting in Heavenly place look at where he put it on questions and answers number nine on your notes read down to there where he said that you were already translated into Heavenly places already translated I thought we believe the soul was redeemed page 49 future home but we're waiting the Redemption of the body right I thought we believe we received eternal life in the new birth did we start our eternal life here right see that's what's going to take us there do we want this whole body to go there this body is going to go there because of what's inside of it that's right right all right okay already in Heavenly places look at number 11. Heavenly places brother Brown said what is it he said the believer's position in Christ the believer's position in Christ is Heavenly places when you receive the new birth that soul went into eternal life or became eternal because it's not Eternal you didn't get the new birth see we want to try to make it some kind of anointing when I said that while ago we only had the earnest of it you know what I'm talking about you got to add Faith Works or knowledge temperate faith has gone in this worldly kindness and all that got on to that's why we're here and that's going to bring us to a change in the body so it's only an Earnest when you get to New Birth I've got to the quotes laying on my desk would you say but brother Dale so go ahead and read number 13 while you're at it paragraph 22 God's only provided a place of worship 1965 11 28 in the morning service you helped me because I used to have an idea when a person died this their just their soul went off but when he quoted now who's he remember the he that's quoting this to him was that he that quoted to him when he was beyond the curtain of time and was questioning the situation and the angel of the Lord said this is Souls under the altar crying how long Angel the Lord referred to souls under the altar hmm when he quoted that to me that if this Earthly Tabernacle of our habitation be we already have one amen and we've got to have everything in trees to make a Perfection see and there's one body here then that body dire which is the celestial body that's what he's saying right and then the glorified body in the resurrection makes it complete now but brother Dale the prophet says we already have one amen the day you receive the new word you start eternal life in your soul and the positive of God's mind is then and in view right amen that's right that's why I love the scripture like it is so let's read it second Corinthians 5 let's read it see what it says for we know that if that if is past tense right that is that's past tense that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were hey dissolved we have a building of God a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens amen no if you die you step right over beyond the curtain of time right around and saw those people there right and they were in their theophanese he said they were and what was their theophany their soul right because the angel said this is sold under the altar the angel of God to referred to brother run these are sold under the altar now remember when he went to hell when the Lord Jesus Christ went to hell he saw souls in hell right right and when brother Brandon went beyond the curtain of time he saw Souls amen people that he could feel that he could hear that he could talk to not just folks floating around they were in their theophany body agree and it says we have a tabernacle and they see Turtle into heaven now maybe I shouldn't be so much to bring out things but I really like to bring them out to prove a point if that's not talking about your soul then that means you've got an eternal body somewhere a human body eternal come on did you get what I said you get it brother Gary if we have a tabernacle and that's a human body let me see turtle in the heavens so while we need a change for eign just like Jesus said I go to prepare you a tabernacle is that what he's saying oh no brother they only said a Dwelling Place well he said he went to perverse of Dwelling Place he went up come right back down into the soul to prepare Dwelling Place a tabernacle a dwelling place is a tabernacle and it's not talking about your physical body is talking about your theophany now remember the only difference in the way that we come in the way Jesus Jesus come a fool in morphe theophany body right and stood back there and said let there be and create it all things well we only received it in a part we only get a part of eternal life now part of eternal life don't mean that that there's a lot of it that ain't eternal that doesn't mean that it just simply is stating the fact we don't get all of God Jesus had all of God he was all of God but it takes all of us putting the parts together to make God you agree but you see sure the minute I die that's a prophet said it starts off as a little trickle so then it becomes a little small stream he said after a while it becomes a river and he said actor while it becomes an ocean and he says you're standing in the presence of God that's the way he describes it and that profit beyond the curtain of time he saw Souls under the altar right you know what they look like what they look like on Earth you know that he recognized his wife and you know that one of them was still on earth when he recognized the other one that one took him by one arm one the other one in another in a form that he's describing it you know he knew all about that like brother Stephen Wilson I know weights brought it out too said one times a good point you know that Sharon hope or what a name would hope that she was 18 months old when she passed on but when brother Brown saw her she was a full grown woman amen amen she then stepped into her theophany ain't gonna be no babies in heaven they ain't gonna be no old people either old age be gone we don't want to get a new body do we we want this body redeemed amen we don't want to get a New Soul do we that's what I'm explaining that's why that scripture says that we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved now he's not talking about this human body because if it was then you you would have to go down to the Life part of it and say that the body would be Eternal in heaven the body's not in heaven the body's in the grave wrote around his body feeling in the casket up here in Jeffersonville Indiana right so that's not the body that you're talking about that'll come forth in the resurrection into a glorified state the body I'm concerned with is the soul that's within us we heard from our theophany when we received the new birth the prophet said we become the word here he said Jesus was the word and a full word in morphe body he said we become the word here as we eat the word you said well brother Dale people say that you don't believe that we've got a body well you better get make sure you read the scripture correctly because it says you have one eternal in the heavens now here's my point if you have eternal life in the Soul by the new birth is there another eternal life waiting somewhere for you and brother Brown said is there any such thing as to eternal life remember the other day he said you couldn't answer that could you he said because it only won now a year back to where you're supposed to wrote that down while ago only one eternal life right you understand what the prophet is saying you understand what the Bible is saying I'm standing right here Body Spirit and soul my heart quits beating in just a Split Second even faster than that right my soul is there it's not here well because eternal life starts here there's the key that I want you to keep on your mind to remember the Old Testament people could not enter into that form of eternal life amen they could be anointed they could do great things that they could not have eternal life in their soul that's right amen because it takes the new birth to have eternal life in your soul or if you've got to go by the grave and come up now brother random says in Matthew 25 I mean that where's that Matthew wanted Matthew 17 excuse me let me get scripture right he said Moses and Elijah was there in their theophany you remember that you know what it looked like Moses and Elijah you know why because that was in their their soul not their natural body yep that was in our show amen see they had went on to their inheritance then they could stand there I ain't never said those Old Testament Saints didn't have no inheritance don't ever think anything like that don't you ever think that I've ever degraded Those Old Testament Saints which you better remember one thing they're called servants right right yes sir they're not called children it takes the new birth to be a child of God those were servants 144 000 that will even get eternal life after we leave here the Bible called I'm sure your Prophet said they will be our servants in the millennium servants a lot to receive in the new birth because the new birth makes you a child of God hear it nothing but in spirit but in your soul okay now if I'm a sinner and my heart quits feeding I'm going to where my body is being provided right I'm going to The Fifth Dimension Center day but if I'm a Christian and I die I just step right over there beyond the curtain of time and it's not a way off of younger that's what we all think that one of these days we're gonna have to make a long jump and run and go away up the prophet said it's 20 feet away to slant now you've explained that people have gone Haywire trying to figure out 20 feet at a slant my slant was it 45 degrees 33 degrees 60 degrees what slang well you're worried about a slant for it in other words another dementia right right you step out of this Dimension into another dimension right but your body doesn't go there it goes to the Grave all right but one day you'll come back together here right right but you see we don't even have to do that wig stand right here be changed in a moment because negative and positive means partial becomes perfect amen amen Heavenly places in Christ Jesus the believer's position amen what do you think about it come on come on brother what do you think about it well I've always just believed in my theophany was up yonder I never said it wasn't that's the positive of God's mind right if there's a headstone the prophet would talk about and you get the new birth of Faith then that headstone is what's pulling you right the positive of God's mind is pulling you but you know the day Martin Luther begin to preach so just show me about faith he reached his positive position he had to go by the grave because there was nowhere else for him to go right right when Wesley began to preach sanctification when he reached the place there was nowhere for him to go there was no message to take him to a change when the Pentecostals received the baptism of the Holy Ghost on the Zeus tree and they reached their place there's nowhere to go but then your steps of profit according to Leviticus 25 8. I believe it is verse 7 7 is 49 here come a prophet and a 49 on the South Church age proclaiming that we could step into eternal life but you know what you've got to have eternal life to go for eternal life is why you don't have to eternal life you only have one eternal life and your eternal life begins in the new birth and is completed when all of this is over with it eternity eternity then you can't have no more than eternity there's only one eternity there's only one Eternal must stand together what we got bro 103. foreign thing to happen Tom shout I could tell you things I had seen God in a church or anything I said I'm not free because it didn't accept Jesus Christ the first of the word and when he said that that one person is real Brian how loud you see Thanksgiving birth personate all of them and then we can't be the only problem s and they go on the basis of coming into this message gave me a new birth oh brother different I'm here if you're viewers until the new Earth God you are real you can use it no if I did anything help me I'll go straighten it up something smart every time I can get a travel I meant it go straight into all the ones that just became knees oh God in dreams if your mind go es real God is pretty bad I guess that's why I preached like I could do something awake experience he gave me I believe God is real full time so I'm not talking about something that's not real didn't they say I'm leaving that today amen so not to say I know I got the Holy Ghost because I believe the message I never said that right but for two years I read and studied I just rejected my family all I've done was work the doorbell and just cried and prayed out before God read and that's when I was reading six books a day and listening to two tapes but you see I knew that it wasn't a new bird the brother mode was not the kind of person to say brother Dale you got to quit this and you got to quit that thank God I run into him and not a lot of people because a lot of people would have said like one brother I said to him he said what do you mean you believe the message he said yeah and the devil believes it too absolutely I'm really Gary sitting back here behind us when he told him but he knows what I told him I said Brother Gary you're trying your best to figure out what the Holy Ghost is and stop it you're trying to find it through whatever you could do or not do whatever stop it yeah I should just simply get down and pray and say God give me the Holy Ghost because you promised it a phone call and he said it's over amen see because the new birth is a birth word and that way they can't take it out of you that's right you take my Bible you can take the prophet's message you can destroy everything but you can't destroy what's inside of me amen amen because that's where I am that's why I believe your soul then when you're born again he brings eternal life to you here puts you in Heavenly places because eternal life come here well what's dark the positive of God's mind waiting for me to reach that place and if I die before the change come don't say it brother deals are messed up no I'll never taught you nothing like that I've never said there was any disgrace in dying going by the grave just say he reached the place God saw he would reach that was it that's right and it was over with and I'll be just as happy the prophet said you just go to sleep and said you wake up and she might take in a nap anyway just be standing right back there 152. living by faith baby anybody have a need less baby what are you I think you've ever
