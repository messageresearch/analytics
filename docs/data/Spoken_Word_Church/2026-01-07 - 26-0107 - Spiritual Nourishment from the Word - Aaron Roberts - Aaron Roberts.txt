Oh, I love you, adore you, and I bow down before you. Heavenly Father, I appreciate you. Holy Spirit, you're a comfort and Holy Spirit, you're a comfort to me. Holy Spirit, you're a comfort to me. Oh, you lead me and you guide me. You're dwelling inside me. Holy Spirit, you're a cons. Oh, let's just sing that again and just raise our hands and give him thanks. Oh heavenly father, I appreciate you. Oh heavenly father, I appreciate you. There's so much to thank him for. Oh, I love you and adore you. I bow down before you. Heavenly Father, I appreciate you. Holy Spirit. Oh, and Holy Spirit, you're a comfort to me. Holy Spirit, you're a comfort to me. Oh, you lead me and you guide me. You're dwelling inside me. Holy Spirit, you're a comfort to me. Amen. for the ride. There's a grace when the heart is under fire. Another way when the walls are closing in. And when I look at the space between where I used to be and this reckoning, I know I will never be alone. There was another in the fire standing next to me. There was another in the waters holding back the seas. Should I ever need reminding of how I've been set free, there is a cross that bears the burden where another died for me. There is another in the fire. On my death left for death beneath the waterers, I'm no longer a sled to my sin anymore. And should I fall in the space between what remains of me and this reckoning, either way, I won't bow to the things of this world. And I know I will never be alone. There is another in the fire standing next to me. There is another in the waters holding back the seas. And should I ever need reminding what power set me free, there is a grave that holds nobody. And another power lives in me. There is another in the fire. Oh, there is another in the fire. Oh, there is another in the fire. Oh, there is another in the fire. Oh, I can see the light in the darkness as the darkness bounced to him. I can hear the roar in the heavens as the space between brein. I could feel the ground shake beneath us as a prison wall cave in. Nothing stands between us. Nothing stands between us. There is no name but the name that is Jesus. He who was and still is and will be through it all. So come what may in the space between all the things unseen in this reckoning. I know I will never be alone. I know I will never be alone. There'll be another in the fire standing next to me. There'll be another in the waters holding back the seas. Should I ever need reminding how good you been to me, I'll count the joy from every battle. cuz I know that's where you'll be. I can see the light in the darkness as a darkness bows to him. I can hear the roar in the heavens as the space between where it's thin. I can feel the ground shake beneath us as a prison walls cave in. Nothing stands between us. Nothing stands between us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. The fourth man in the fire. &gt;&gt; I tell you, I think you could preach a whole series on that. &gt;&gt; And um I've said before, when you think you're alone, you're not alone. &gt;&gt; He's here. He's with you. The one that's in the fire with you is the one that made the fire. &gt;&gt; In the scriptures, they couldn't even smell the smoke. I coined the term, he's the god of the periodic table. He understands every level of every element that we're going through. And there's a different kind of fire we're in. It's a refining fire, right? It's getting us ready for our body change. And he's there with us. Amen. He's in us. Amen. Let's all stand this evening and uh just turn to your neighbor, shake each other's hand, greet him in the name of the Lord. So thankful for his presence here. Um Amen. He's the word and uh we just come expecting and just pull on that gift, pull on that word for your need this afternoon. And as we sing word of God ever true, as uh brother Aaron come, you know, I I realize that you get out of the service what you put into it. &gt;&gt; And uh if you prepare your heart to just come and expect um it doesn't have to be a lot of emotion. It's just that pull that that hunger. Stay thirsty. Always stay thirsty for the word of God. Um because it's what changes us from this dimension to that dimension. And um it's the unseen. And you know, we had a prophet to always point us look to the unseen. Look at that one, that fourth man. Look at the son of man. He's here to reveal himself. And that same one back there is still here. What an eternal presence it is. And we're thankful that holy words long preserved for our walk in this world. They resound with God's own heart. Oh, let the word of God impart and words of life. It's words of hope. It gives us strength. It helps us cope. In this world, wherever we roam, the word of God will guide us home. Oh word of God, ever true. Change in me, change in you. We have come with open hearts. Oh, let the word of God impart and holy words of our faith. They're handed down to this age came to us through sacrifice. Oh, heed the faithful words of Christ and holy words long preserved for our walk in this world with God's own heart. Oh, let the word of God impart and word of God ever true is changing me is changing you. We have come with open hearts. Oh, let the word of God impart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Y'all be seated for a minute. Good to be in the house of the Lord again. &gt;&gt; And Lord willing after tonight, y'all get a break from me. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We appreciate all our all of our help and &gt;&gt; and uh we appreciate just our being able to do our part and uh whatever whatever we can do and uh so um give me the key of C. As I travel through this land, there are trials on every hand. And without an anchor, I'd be shipwrecked on the sands. But I have a guide, an absolute on which I stand. I've been changed by grace into a brand new man. Yes, I've been changed by grace into a brand new man. The old man had to die when I was born again. Well, something made over just would not do. And I've been changed by grace into someone brand new. Well, the age I was living in was wretched, naked, and blind. But then on my soul, Lord, you let your light shine. The creature that I was no longer stand. And I've been changed by grace into a brand new man. Oh, I've been changed by grace into a brand new man. The old man had to die when I was born again. Well, something made over just would not do. I've been changed by grace into someone brand new. Yes, I've been changed by grace into a brand new man. The old man had to die when I was born again. Well, something made over just would not do. And I've been changed by grace into someone brand new. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. We've been changed. &gt;&gt; Changed from the old man. &gt;&gt; Amen. Into someone in the image of God. Amen. By the word, he's changed us. Amen. Praise God. If you have your Bibles tonight, let's all stand and uh look into the scripture. We're going to read from two places. Psalms 103 and then Matthew chapter 4. And uh this is the just trying to find the right thing to say tonight and you know this being the like the first service of the year new year for us and just trying to come you know what would the Lord have us say tonight &gt;&gt; and looking forward to a new year and lots of opportunities, possibilities, and blessings and and you know, we know we're going to face battles and but thank God he's he's leading us, leading the way, and that &gt;&gt; he's in charge. And &gt;&gt; praise God that uh you know, we've been given the armor of God to &gt;&gt; to lead us. And uh tonight on I want to speak on uh spiritual nourishment from the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. and uh we're going to start here in in Psalms 103 beginning at verse one. And uh look at look at a few things and we may not get done with it tonight, but uh you know the word of God is full and it's rich and a lot of good things there and it's eternal. So you can't you can't exhaust it. &gt;&gt; So before we read the scripture tonight, let's just uh speak to the author. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we thank you, Lord, that we're able to gather in your house tonight. Lord, we're just able to look into your word, Lord, by your your help, Lord, your mercy and grace to us. And Lord, we just pray that Lord, you have your will and way with us tonight. And Lord, just speak to our hearts, Lord, as we look into your word. And Lord, each one that's here tonight, Lord Jesus, you know what what our hearts desires are, Lord Jesus, what our needs are. those that are watching in tonight, Lord Jesus. Lord, we just pray that you be with them and Lord, just touch each one and Lord, we just commit all things to you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Psalms 103, beginning at verse one. It says, "Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and forget not all his benefits. Who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who health all thy diseases, who redeemth thy life &gt;&gt; from destruction, who crowneth thee with loving kindness and tender mercies, who satisfyth thy mouth with good things, so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles. Amen. So that's what we are in this in this end time. We are eagles. We're God's eagles. And the word satisfies us and renews our our strength and our youth like the eagle. In Matthew 4 beginning at verse three, chapter of Matthew 4 beginning at verse three and it says, "And when the tempter came to him, he said, if thou be the son of God, command that these stones be made bread. And he answered and said, it is written, man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God." Amen. And you may be seated tonight. And you know there's many scriptures that you can look at uh to to start with from here and just trying to come up with a just find the mind of God. But I want to read a a a few quotes here starting out and um this is from the from the message Abraham and brother Brandham's speaking here and he's speaking of El Shadai and he talks about he said that El Shadai means the the the breast the the bosom of a woman. He said El Shadai the almighty the strength giver the nourisher. He said like the mother to the baby. said when a little baby is fretting and sick, the mother pulls it up to her and bosom and it nurses her strength and her life into it. And he said another thing it does, it means a satisfier. So when a baby is not is is fredding or whatever, then it can nurse from the mother. &gt;&gt; He said it's satisfied while it's a nursing. He said it ain't well yet, but it's satisfied as long as it's drawing from the mother. And God is El Shadai, the bosom. He said not one breast, two breasts. He said God is our strength for spiritual. He is our strength for our physical. And he said no matter which one you need of it. He said move up to the breast and take a hold of it God's word and go to nursing from it. You'll come back to health and strength. The strength of the Holy Ghost lies in God's promises. He said take up there one time and take a hold. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so another time, brother Brandham is speaking in Abraham's covenant confirmed and he's speaking of of El Shadai being the breasted one. And he said, "See you you nourish." He said, "Lan on his breast and nourish your spiritual strength out of his word." Here's his breast. He said, "Both old and new testament." He said, "Set down." He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. The same milk. It comes from one mother's breast is from the other one just exactly. And he said, he said, "It's just two different phases of He said he was wounded. He said, "If you're sick," he said, "Why don't you just hold on to his breast of promise?" He said, "I was wounded for your transgression. With my stripes, you were healed." He said, "What do you have need of tonight? Just lean upon his breast." And another thing, he said, "Did you know El Shadai means the strong one." &gt;&gt; He said, "Elshai, the sufficient one, the lifegiver, the almighty strong one." Abraham, he said, "You're a hundred years old, old and weak." He said, "But I am your strength." And so we see here that speaking of all that we have need of lays in him and and brother Brennham in the message oneness he's speaking of El Shada and he's speaking he said and he said that we would just ho that he would just hover over us and nourish us and give us today our daily bread both physically and spiritually that we might have the sustaining strength of body to walk about upon the earth and the sustaining power of the Holy Spirit to bring the word of God to a hungry people and to leave here with it upon our lips and in our hearts with such fresh anointing oil that we'd be able to tell others of the day that we are living and the condition of time. He said God we are fully trusting in you. He said there is no other place left no one could go to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when we look here brother brother brother Rand was talking about if there's one that we can go to is God. He's he's the allsufficient one. He's El Shadai. So whatever you have need of, he is the one that you can draw all your strength from. Whatever you have need of, it lays in the word of God. You can draw all that you have need of is in laying inside God and inside the word. And all you got to do is draw from it. &gt;&gt; And he is he's the allsufficient one, but he's also our nourisher. He's our lifegiver. He's he's a source of everything that we have need of. All you got to do is draw from it. and to and and I was I was reading online and I and I don't you know AI or one of those internet scholars or whoever it was that that wrote this and and I just I just took it down because it it kind of explains everything but you know somebody talking about nourishing and it says to nourish someone means to provide whatever is needed for their growth, health and well-being which goes beyond just physical food to include emotional, mental and spiritual support through encouragement, care, and fostering their development. It involves sustaining life, fostering dreams, strengthening beliefs, and building up a person or relationship so they can strive, thrive, and reach their potential. &gt;&gt; So, if you're looking at he he's being our nourisher that we can come to God and get everything that we have need of, well, he he is the one that touches every aspect of our life. Every facet of our life is touched by God. And he's the one that you can draw from to receive everything that you have need of. And that's what he wants us to do is receive everything that we have need of from him. And all we got to do is go because he's there to give it to you. He's ready to supply it to you. All you got to do is reach out and take a hold of it. &gt;&gt; And you know, just like brother Brandham said, you know, when a when a baby is crying out or whatever, he said God has provided a way. He said, all you got to do is cry out. And he said, "God will answer just like a mother will come take the baby and give it what it has need of." He said, "Well, if you just cry out to God, he'll do the same thing." He is waiting for you to cry out. But the problem is is we DON'T CRY OUT TO GOD. &gt;&gt; But he's here tonight to speak to each one of us to give us exactly what we have need of. And all you have to do is tap in to that eternal life flow and get everything that you have need of. &gt;&gt; That's right. Just draw from it from that brother saying THAT INEXHAUSTIBLE fountain of life IS HERE. ALL YOU GOT TO do is draw from it. &gt;&gt; See this is what God wants us to have is this eternal. And so we want to draw all of our spiritual nourishment from the word of God. And as as Jesus told the devil that day, he said, "Man shall not live by bread alone." He said, "But by every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God." So when we go to get what God has, we want to take every word of God. We want TO TAKE EVERY JOT AND EVERY TITLE. We don't want to leave one thing behind. I want everything that God has because I don't want to be left behind by one little bit. BECAUSE IF I WANT TO BE SUSTAINED by God, if I want to be nourished by God, if I want to be strengthened by God, then you know what? It takes all of it. &gt;&gt; It takes everything that God has. You can't leave one thing behind. You got to take it all. Right? &gt;&gt; Because the problem is is we live in a day and an hour which everybody likes to pick and choose. And you see the kind of condition that the world is in today. And then we what is because the kind of condition that the world is in today is producing the condition that people are in today. &gt;&gt; And from the from the message this is from the message at thy word 1951. Brother Brandham speaking and he was talking about uh being in you know in the meetings. He said I was very thin then and he said a lady came to help me and she brought him so said brother Brandham take these and she so she gave him something and he said he had a doctor friend there who was saw saw what he had and he took them and he looked at him and he was like well you know he said I don't like to take medicine he said brother Brandham he said these are this is not medicine he said these are vitamins &gt;&gt; and he said he said you need to take these and he said he said anything that'll help you he said I'm all for that that's right that's mercy He said he said I don't ris disregard it as a medicine. It was a medicine anyhow. &gt;&gt; So he wasn't brother Brandon was not was not not somebody that liked to take medicine. But the the doctor was telling he said but brother Brandon he said he said our land has become so poor. &gt;&gt; He said all the vitamins pulled out till it's artificially fertilized and things to when we eat we don't get the right amount of vitamin no matter how much we eat. He said, "It's just bulk." And he said, "We don't get the vitamins and everything and everyone should take those vitamins." &gt;&gt; He said, "See, the grounds wore out." He said, "Everything, it's just the end, isn't it?" He said, "That's right." He said, "Just then, that's it." He said, "It looks like the whole world's a reeling in home." So, because of the earth and the condition that it's in physically, people are dying. People are falling apart. Why? Because there's no nourishment in the earth. because it's all been wore out. It's all been messed up because you know man has to get in put his hands in everything that God has &gt;&gt; because they have to interject themselves into God's laboratory into God's program and all they've done is destroy themselves and they destroy everything else because you know they they can't because it's the intelligence of a man because they have to eat from the tree not from the tree of life but they're eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. And the problem is is all it does is produce death. It produced death in the garden and it produces death today. &gt;&gt; So we're seeing this same thing that takes place. They're eating these things and physically people are dying because you there's no nourishment in it. &gt;&gt; And thank God for medicine and thank God for medical science and everything. But you know even even medical science has its limitations. &gt;&gt; Yes. And you know, you realize all these things that they try to give you, you have to watch these things because sometimes they're not out for your best interest &gt;&gt; because all they do is go to the book and they and you know the you know the American Medical Association or whatever, you know, whoever they go to, you know, it's like, hey, well, you know what? If you have these symptoms, we give you this, right? &gt;&gt; And if you have these symptoms, we give you this. And the problem is is well I'm I'm I'm just I'm just kind of old school. But the problem is is you know back years ago when the Indians were here and they were on the on the earth you know they just went out and and took things right out of the ground out of the nature and used those things and they didn't have to have something that's super processed and you know had had to go through things that that you can't even pronounce. You can't even spell. You don't even know what it is. &gt;&gt; But you know, the first thing you start doing just like when when the doctor when I went to the hospital that day, you know, I just I had felt bad for quite a while. And you know, they I finally just decid I got I got to have something done because my heart was fluttering and having so many problems. I was like, I got to have something. Well, you know, they went in and checked me. It's like, hey, you ain't got a heart problem. &gt;&gt; You ain't got cholesterol. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I'm I'm I'm 51 years old. Next month I'll be 52 years old. My cholesterol is under 200. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And you know because you know I just have faith in God. I I believe what God said. But you know when when they put me on they di diagnosed me with diabetes and that's what that's what they called it. It's the devil. &gt;&gt; But that's what they and they want to put me on medicine. Hey take this medicine. And the one doctor says, 'Well, we think you might get off of it one day. And I like, "Oh, I I I don't I don't know about that. I I don't know. I don't Well, you know what? I appreciate you. I appreciate your study. I I appreciate your expertise, &gt;&gt; but I'm not going to take that." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you know what? I'm getting off of this thing. &gt;&gt; I do it for a while. Thank God. Just like brother Dale said, you take you take your medicine, the doctor gives you the medicine and then you take it and you take a prayer cloth and you put it with your medicine and say, "By his stripes I'm healed." And you know what? Do what he said. But you know what? Just like pop always told us. He said, "One of these days the doctor will tell you, quit taking that stuff." &gt;&gt; And you know, one day I took it for two and a half years and that's you know, and I I battled that thing all the time. But you know what? I was gonna get free of that devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you know, &gt;&gt; I said, "Satan, get behind me." &gt;&gt; You know, you ain't you ain't got any right here. I'm casting you out. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, you know, I battled that thing, but you know what? I praise God that one of the one day I finally got free of that thing. It's like, listen, that's right. &gt;&gt; I appreciate and other people take it and thank God it helps people or whatever, but you know, it's not for me and I ain't taking it because I've seen people I was talking to brother Mark the other day. We was talking about people start on on diabetes medicine. Next thing you know, they got you on cholesterol medicine, they got you on a heart pill, they got you on something else, they got you on something else because all it does is starts deteriorating your body and then you got to get another pill for that pill. And just like brother Brown talking about, you know, you got to take one pill for this and the pill for that. Next thing you know, and he said, you know, then you got to go see the psychiatrist and the psychiatrist got to have a psychiatrist and you know, it just keeps deteriorating. It just keeps going down. Well, you know what? I know that God is the healer. And I just went to God and I believed that he was going to touch me. And you know what? I don't have to take those things. Praise God. And &gt;&gt; I I do I do take my my multivitamins and I take my fish oil and and all those things, but you know what? I'm I'm I'm just I'm just doing what what they want me to do. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? UH, you know, all things are sanctified by the word of God and prayer. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. And you know, we we live in this world and we can't we can't change a lot of things, but you know, there are certain things that we can change and we can we can do certain things and and you know, I mean, you know, you know, at Christmas time, you know, we we get a lot of candy and and things and you know, people get, you know, and it's like I I I've got I've gotten a lot of candy and chocolate and everything like that. And Sarah's asked me in the past, she's like, "Are you going to eat that?" It's like, well, you know, I I eat it a little bit at a time. I might a little here or there, you know, but you know, I'm not just going to sit down and just fill up on it. &gt;&gt; And if I don't eat it, that's all right. I I'll give it to somebody else. Let them enjoy it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But, you know, like like I told him, I was like, getting on the scale and seeing that number go down. &gt;&gt; It's that's that's a better feeling than anything I've ever in the world. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's a struggle. But you know what God has give us? If if God give you the power to overcome other things, God give you the power to overcome food. &gt;&gt; He had he he had he had do me that way. &gt;&gt; That's tough. &gt;&gt; I mean, but you know, I'm I I go through these things, but you know what? I I still trust God and I still thank God and I still believe &gt;&gt; because you know what? He wants us to prosper and be in health. And so if you have an an problem, then guess what? God will lead you &gt;&gt; and God will help you overcome and you got to battle this thing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And so I I just I just believe that God is the one that'll lead us and take care of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Ram was talking about, you know, eating all the things out of this earth and they're not any good. But he said, you know, the thing is that God has given us mana. God give us the spiritual mana, but give us mana to eat on. And and he was he was speaking of of David and he said, you know, eating that spiritual mana. When when David got into certain times in his life and he had all these all these hard problems and different things that he was struggling with, but you know, he went in the presence of God and he began to worship and he began to meditate on God and he began to thank God for all the things that had happened to him. And all of a sudden, you know, he began to have, as brother Brandham said, a real gastronomical jubilee because he began to feast on the things of God. And he began to rejoice in all these things. He said, you know, and and he said, it begins to fill you out &gt;&gt; if you're dealing if you're taking the things of God, it'll give you what you have need of. He said, ' Don't you know, he said, when you when you get real weak and you eat a big great big square meal, how good you feel when you eat something and it fills you up and you know you, whoa, that feels good. He said, like the like that man that went to the doctor that day and he said, he said, doctor, I'm sick. He said, I'm weak. He said, what's the matter? He said, he be the doctor began to ask him. He said, I don't know what's wrong with me. The doctor began to ask him questions. He said, all right. He said, when was the last time you ate? He said, I ate a half a cracker the day before yesterday. He said, "The problem is," he said, "you're hungry." &gt;&gt; And he said, he said, "And that's what's the matter with the church today. It's anemia because they're not getting enough spiritual food." He said, "If they got the Bible, brother, it would put the blood of Christ into the veins of the believer." He said, "New life, new." He said, "Life comes from the blood." Amen. The anemia condition of the church, pitiful, pale cheek. My my we need a transfusion to start off us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that's what you have to do is because there's a need that's in the body that you have to go and get these things. And the problem is is people just go through these things and they don't realize what they have need of. But there's a way to go and get what they have need of &gt;&gt; because if you'll go and get these things because he said if you go and get them, he said then you'll have what you have need of. He tells a little story about the calf, you know, the two calves and the one had a had a good farmer and then put him up in the barn and fed him good grain and all kinds of good things all all winter long and the other one was just out eating weeds and just just barely getting by and struggling all all winter just trying to get something to eat and he just getting all thin and couldn't hardly get around. He said the one that was in the barn had been eating all winter. He said when he come out in the springtime, he was out there clicking his heels and jumping up and having a good time and rejoicing and that other one that had struggled the whole time. He said there, "My my my such fanaticism." &gt;&gt; I can't believe that you're doing that. Well, you know what? If you had been in the same condition that one had been in, you'd be doing the exact same thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if you'd got into the presence of God and had been get to eat those things like that little calf had had been eating all those things, then you know what? Then you wouldn't be weak. then you wouldn't have problems. &gt;&gt; Oh, well, you know what? We're not free from problems. Let me tell you something. When when God's on your side, there's a time that you go through, you get stirred up on the inside, you know what? Your problems don't hold you down. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because if if you have because the one thing that is promised by by the things that that God gives us is but one of the things he gives us is joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you have joy, you know what? Then then you have something that carries you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have strength that carries you. &gt;&gt; Because you know you realize that all these things that all your problems are not going to going to things are not going to stay this way forever. &gt;&gt; You know when you go through these storms, praise God, you know what? He comes walking on the water in the midst of your storms when whatever it is, it doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; Even even when even when when Lazarus was there, you know, and got sick and kept getting weak and weak and weak and weaker and you know, all the problems that he had and they went and buried him, you know what? And still God came on the scene. &gt;&gt; Jesus knew what was taking place. He had seen the vision of what was going to take place. Well, what he do? He just waiting. Amen. He knew what was going to take place. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Mary and Martha was down there weeping and wonder what was where was Jesus? Where was Jesus? He was right on time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It hadn't come to the time for deliverance yet. But you know what? He was all right on time when he came to the place that when he said he said, "Where does where is where did you lay him? Where is he at?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And went down there and spoke to Lazarus and brought him out of the ground. &gt;&gt; So it was it was in the right time. And sometimes we wonder where's God at? Where's God at? Well, you know what? Sometimes the problem is we don't realize he's waiting to the right time because he's never late. &gt;&gt; We don't know when he's GOING TO BE, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? HE never fails us. He never forsakes us. He never leaves us. So guess what? He's coming on the scene. All you GOT TO DO IS HAVE EXPECTATION and believe that God's going to do it. &gt;&gt; See, if we believe, we just we just hold on and God will come on the scene. You know, this is from the message, the unwelcome Christ. Brother R was speaking and he was talking about the the meetings that that he was in and holding meetings and and seeing God come down and and and manifest himself. And he said in these meetings where the Holy Spirit comes down and speaks to the people, he says, "Shows signs and wonders and heals the blind, deaf, dumb, paralytics, and so forth, people turn away sometimes. They they they carried that church too late tonight." He said, "Parisee, what's the matter with you? You're in the presence of Christ. &gt;&gt; You're standing in the presence of Christ and not and missing what's taking place." &gt;&gt; He said, "You can ever be sure that that you see his words are moving. You ought to fall on your face and say, "God, be merciful to me." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said, "But we got time for other things." He said, "Oh, I wish he'd hurry up and quit preaching. 20 minutes is long enough for any preacher to preach. &gt;&gt; He said, "Why? You're starving to death." &gt;&gt; He said, "You're so thin, you look like a shadow." &gt;&gt; He said, "You need a good 4hour sermon &gt;&gt; sometimes to fatten you up on gospel vitamins." &gt;&gt; He said, "That's what the church needs today." Because the prayer is we get up in the morning. Thank the Lord that we opened our eyes and we hit the floor and we pray over our food and then we pray now lay me down to sleep. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we we fail to miss God all day long. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But it's it's only when we HAVE A PROBLEM. GOD, WHERE ARE YOU? &gt;&gt; We just we just got God on 911. Heaven 911, what's your emergency? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And we wonder why we have a problem. Why? Because, you know, we we miss coming to church sometimes and and and not realize that here here's God speaking to us. God's trying to deal with us. It's like, "Oh, brother, we we we could we could make it four hours." I I I don't know. I don't know what we'd do if we had to sit here four hours. &gt;&gt; But you know what? They can put a movie on. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Gone with the Wind. I'd be Gone with a Wind, too. I'd start that movie. I could I couldn't handle that one. That's a long That's a long movie. And it's like I was telling sister June that that man was talking about uh reading reading Shakespeare and and he was all excited about reading Shakespeare and he was going through there and he was talking about the murder and the intrigue and and all these things that was taking place and and the ghost and all these things like that and that guy another guy was standing there and said but there's no car chase scene in it. So it didn't matter none the rest of it mattered to him but he was just looking for action. He missed all the other things that were in it. And so it's the same way. Sometimes we miss all the things that have taken place and somebody trying to explain to well that that's not what I'm looking for. &gt;&gt; But sometimes when when we get in but we can the things that that we look for the things that we want. But the thing is is if we're of God then the things of God is what we ought to be drawing from. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said the greatest joy that he had the greatest consolation that he had was meditation on God's word. Amen. &gt;&gt; The the best time that he had was meditation and studying in God's word. &gt;&gt; It's like, "Oh, no. My my my my greatest time is watching a ball game &gt;&gt; or sitting in a treeand." &gt;&gt; Well, you know what? Praise God. You You can sit in a treeand and and you can read your Bible &gt;&gt; and you can listen to a message. Or you can be like me, I'm sitting the tree staying as slip, &gt;&gt; and that felt good, too. &gt;&gt; It's like, well, if if the Lord wanted me to have a deer, he he had woke me up. He did wake me up. So, &gt;&gt; and if there was any deer that came by, the Lord, I guess, maybe didn't want them get killed or nothing. So, &gt;&gt; but I enjoyed myself. &gt;&gt; But, you know, God has a provision for each one of us. has something for each one of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So here in the in the message the the blessing this is from the uh message blessing prophet and brother Brown's talking about the people and the things that the the ministry and how the ministry ought to be pressing. And he said if we saw these things, you know, it would cause us to be on our knees praying and and and expressing these things because the the ministry is the one that is supposed to be expressing these things to the to the people. &gt;&gt; And so it's it's our job to do these things. And he said, I I've made up my mind. He said, by the help and grace of God, he said, God will give me the strength to do. He said, I'm determined to press toward the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus till death shall set me free. God be my helper. Help me in my prayer is my prayer seeing the works and seeing the things that I have seen and you have seen and lagging behind and become a spiritual amnesia or uh anemia, &gt;&gt; a spiritual anemia when you've seen God come on the scene and you've seen the things that that he has seen and he was talking about seeing all the miracles that have taken place in the meetings and all the things and how the ministry is the one that should be taking because you know what it's not it's You you can't blame just the the the the leoty for it. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham laid the laid the blame on the preachers. &gt;&gt; The ministry takes the blame. It's our fault. &gt;&gt; Because if we're not if we're not the example, then don't expect anybody else to do it. &gt;&gt; He said, "But God give us that that we would not be a spiritual anemia." Anemic. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if this is what God has given us, then this is what we need to do. We need to be an example to the people. He said, "And to think that after God's doing that," and he said, "and we turn around and dillydally in the things of the world and become a very spiritual anemia." He said, "How we ought to be the lighthouse that set on a hill, a candle that cannot be hid." &gt;&gt; Because if God has given this, then this is what we ought to be doing. This is what we ought to be. We ought to be a shining light for these things. Because if it's taking place and it should be in us, then it should be showing to the world. The world should see these things. And if it's not, then you know what? It should drive us to a place that we repent to drive us to our knees. &gt;&gt; And because if God has given you grace to see these things, then it ought to have a have a place in our heart that we repent and that we would pray for the world. &gt;&gt; That we pray for those that don't see these things. &gt;&gt; Amen. God want because there there's there if you if you have the have the Holy Ghost on the inside then the Holy Ghost wants to express on the outside then you see people in the condition that they're in and you try to talk to people and you might as well be talking to the wall &gt;&gt; even over simple things. You know, I I've had I've I've had a chance to talk to a man a couple of times about things and it's just, you know, he's got he's he's a Baptist. He's he's a great man. He's Baptist. But let me tell you what, he is he's built on the foundation of the Baptist doctrine. &gt;&gt; And you know what? He was Baptist born and he's Baptist bred. And when he dies, he'll be Baptist dead. because you know what? He ain't getting off of that. &gt;&gt; But he's but he's built on but he believes the Baptist doctrine is the Bible. And if you try to show him anything that's contrary to that, you know what? He go right back to the Bible. He go, "Well, the well, the Bible says this." And we we were talking about about marriage and and things like that. And I I was telling him I was like, "Listen," I said, "You're married by your vow." &gt;&gt; I said, "When you make a vow to a man and he makes a vow to a woman." I said, "Y'all married?" I said, "I don't care what else goes on." &gt;&gt; I said, "That makes a that's the marriage covenant." I said, "What happened in back there when when the angel spoke to Joseph and said, "Don't be afraid to take Mary thy wife." And they hadn't even been together. They were a spouse. &gt;&gt; They were not married. &gt;&gt; But in God's eyes, Mary was Joseph's wife. &gt;&gt; I said, "That's Bible." I said, I said because in the Old Testament, if you made a vow, you are hold you held to that. &gt;&gt; God held you responsible for your for your vow. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; I said it's a it's a very serious thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, &gt;&gt; you can. You and you know nowadays it's just well you just you just you know they get engaged, break up, shack up, do whatever. &gt;&gt; I said you can't find that in the scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said because if you go back into the scripture and you look in the Old Testament, well, we we're we're in the we're in the we're we're in the New Testament. We're under grace. I said, well, you know what? the Paul that that wrote the the New Testament. The Apostle Paul said to flee fornication. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said, "That's not Old Testament doctrine. That's New Testament doctrine." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I said, "And for those that know not to do better and they don't," he said, "that's iniquity." &gt;&gt; And every You know what? And God and God is a is a God of mercy and a God of grace, but you know, he's also a God of judgment. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you just can't you just can't go around however you want to and whenever you feel like it that you're just going to plead for God's mercy and just get repentance and he just going to cover you over because he's not some dirty grandpa. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you know what? If you if you have if you have bring forth meat for repentance, then you know what? THEN IT PUTS YOU ON A PATH TO GO AWAY FROM THOSE THINGS. &gt;&gt; That's right. And if you can continue to do those things and it doesn't prick your heart, then there's a problem with your birth. &gt;&gt; And the problem is most people never had one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, we just we just go to the we just come to the altar and we just shake the preacher's hand and we we just recite some prayer or whatever and we go to the water and get baptized and that's okay. The problem is is you went to the water and you went down a dry center and you came up a wet one and there hadn't been any change in your life. &gt;&gt; And the problem is is you wonder why kids come into churches and they can't stand anything and they just fall right back out and the devil drags them right back into the world and THEY FILTH THEY JUST HAVE SO MANY PROBLEMS. WHY? BECAUSE THEY'RE they bring the because they bring all of the world right into the church. That's it. &gt;&gt; And they don't know what they don't know what a Christian life is because nobody shows them. &gt;&gt; When you when you have people in church and it's just like, well, we're we're just we're just we're just sinners saved by grace. Amen. We are. But you know what? The Holy Ghost makes a change in your life. &gt;&gt; It begins to change you. You have a because if he's on the inside and he's leading, you have a desire for the things of God &gt;&gt; and you just come to church and just dress however you want to and live however you want to. And you come to church and you got and you don't have enough gumption about you, any moral about you, you'd steal a quarters off a dead man's eyes and you wonder why people why people in the church live the way that they do. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Why? because they've never had an experience. They don't know anything about it. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's not and it's not just and it's not just out in the world. It's many places people people come to church and you know they they've got brother Brandham's books and you know and they and they've got pictures on the wall and on their phone and all kinds of other stuff like that. But you know what they don't they don't have any more idea what the new birth is than than they know about philosophy or they could do Chinese algebra. They don't know anything. They don't know the first thing about it. &gt;&gt; Why? Because they they've just come in church and they sat in a building and they heard somebody talk about God sent a prophet and they read quotes, but you know what? They've never been in contact with the life &gt;&gt; when they've never been in contact with the Holy Spirit to lead them to the place because you know what? IT'S IF IT'S DONE ON THE inside of a real true believer that it'll bring it a it'll come across your path. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because we got so many people. The de the devil's out. He just wants to show you a bunch of counterfeits. &gt;&gt; There's lots of counterfeits. But you know what? Because that's what ought to be down on the inside of us to stir us to say, "Lord, am I living the right kind of life? Am I expressing the things that are of God? Can people see me?" Because if people see me, will they always remember that they see Jesus Christ in me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like the old song, when they looked, they beheld him. When I spoke, they could hear him. When I walked, my every footstep carried them all to Calvary. &gt;&gt; He said, "Let others seek worldly fame. But when someone hears his name, let them recall they saw him in me. &gt;&gt; Can people see can see Can people see Jesus Christ in us? &gt;&gt; Not just a book of rules, &gt;&gt; not just dos and don'ts, &gt;&gt; but do they see Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; Is the Holy Spirit living in through us that can minister to other people? That's what I want. &gt;&gt; I want I want people to to know that that we have tapped in to that source that is flowing through us. Brother Bram says here talking about people today they say well the Holy Ghost is not for today and these things and he said all this divine healing stuff for some other day. See it's not a reflection from God. He said it's a reflection from a creed. He said it's a reflection from a doctrine that's outside the Bible. He said, 'But Hebrews 13:8 said he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. He said, St. John 14:12 said, he said, "He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also." Now, how are you going to take that word out of there? How are you going to add something in its place? He said, "You break the chain of life. Man shall not live by bread alone." Right. &gt;&gt; The bread eternally. He gives he lives by that bread. Physically he lives by this bread. &gt;&gt; He said there's two breads. The Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is in you. Says amen to every word of God. If that is the Holy Ghost. Now I want to ask you something. He said, 'N now this is he said this is the pinching point because he was speaking of this and talking about us not eating right and he was talking about when he was growing up and he was he was eating all all the things in the world that you know growing up poor and they didn't have a lot to eat and he was talking about his mama and he said you know she just take fat and they had to render it down and come up with all kind of little stuff to eat and has eaten, ate so poor, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But you know, there was something that had to come in to help help him live. &gt;&gt; And you know, Brother Ram always talked about his mama every Saturday she give him a big dose of castor. &gt;&gt; And he's like, "Oh, mama, I can't handle that." He said, "Even even like when he grew up, you know, brother, I still can't stand to smell that today." &gt;&gt; But what was it? He said, "If it don't make you sick, it ain't going to do you any good. What was it? Because they had fed on all kinds of other stuff, but there was something to help get all that stuff out of your system. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you got to take something in to help purge all of that thing to get you to that place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, it's all got to come out. He said, "So, we had all this poor eating." He said, "No wonder we had such malnutrition, everything because of the things we didn't have that was right." &gt;&gt; But see, now he said, he said, "I want to ask you something." He said, "How can a man or a woman who claims to be filled with the Holy Spirit, which is the word?" That's right. He said, "How can you be the flesh of that Holy Spirit, he has made you part of him to reflect the gospel of this age and deny the word that he wrote?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How can we deny the word that was written? &gt;&gt; If if it if it's in the word, then you know what? We believe it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just not just some idea, &gt;&gt; but it's got to be what's in the word and it's got to be made live. He said, "See, it's by the word." How you live, you live by the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram was talking about the the the kind old priest and talking about the kind old priest. You know, he had more of the fruits than Jesus did. &gt;&gt; He show Oh, the kind old priest. The kind old priest. But who lived by the word? &gt;&gt; Who manifested the word? &gt;&gt; He said it's not by the fruit. It says by the word. &gt;&gt; He said man shall not live by fruit alone. He said by by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he was that word. He said see they fail to see it. That's what he was supposed to do. They couldn't see it because they weren't ordained to see it. &gt;&gt; He said he said you can't come to me, &gt;&gt; but it comes to those that are predestinated to it. that you come to those things and here you are. You're supposed to draw these things and God has these things for us. &gt;&gt; And so if you have these things on the inside and you're feasting on these things and you're drawing these things, then you have to you have to get in there and take these things that God has and you and draw every bit of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the problem is like brother Ram said, he said, you know, because the problem that people have is they compromise on the word. That's right. &gt;&gt; They've compromised on the word just like Eve did. She compromised on the word. She didn't hold to the place that she had that God had told her. And he said, "See, an eagle would not compromise." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, you look," he said, "you see all you see all of these the hulks and the and the buzzards and everything like that. They can eat different things and go out and find some dead carrying somewhere or whatever and eat this or that." And he said, "But you know what? A real eagle won't have anything to do with that. Why? Because there's nothing sustaining in that. &gt;&gt; And that putrid stuff laying there that wouldn't have anything to do with it. Why? Because the the eagle is looking for a fresh keel. &gt;&gt; He said that he said he said see he goes and looks. He said he's looking for that fresh mana. &gt;&gt; And he said he'll get down there and he said he'll dig till he finds it. He'll fly higher and higher. He said if it's not in this valley, he'll raise up a little higher. He'll fly to the next one. He'll keep looking because he's going to find it. &gt;&gt; He said, "So, it's time for the eagles of this day to get to flying higher, dig into God's promises, not live on vulture food that's been killed years ago. Get out of that." &gt;&gt; See, you have to get away from those things. Well, what what do you what do we need? Brother Bam told about the condition that the world was in, the condition that the church is in. He said, "Why?" Because he said, "We don't have any more prayer meetings." He said, "No more agonizing with God to fulfill his word." He said, "No more believing that God is still the same yesterday, today, and forever." He said, "They just vulturize down, get a denomination, put their name on the book, and got lazy and soft, and sets back their gloating on some kind of a dead carrying." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he said there's supposed to be at least a hulk that's a similar brother to the eagle, the prophet. That's the true word manifested. But now they just go back to something from the past, &gt;&gt; living on some kind of dead carcass &gt;&gt; and leaving the things behind and not trying to dig in &gt;&gt; and find their own &gt;&gt; and seeking God to lead them. Oh, my pastor is so and so. &gt;&gt; Well, you know what? You can you can come to church and Brother Wade can be your pastor. He can be your pastor every day of your life and you can come in, pay your ti, and come sit on the pew. And you know what? If you don't have a new birth experience and you don't if you don't grow beyond that, you can sit here and go to hell and brother Wayade will still be your pastor. &gt;&gt; And it won't do you any it won't do you any good. Because we had people just like Judas. Judas was there &gt;&gt; and walked walked with the word made flesh. The son of man walked in his midst &gt;&gt; and it didn't do him a bit of good. Why? Because he he was not ordained to that. &gt;&gt; But he stood right there with Jesus. Walked with Jesus, ate with Jesus, had all these things. what saw all the miracles, &gt;&gt; preached the word, had all these things happen. You know what? He still went to hell. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, you can't can't live on the things that came from for another hour. &gt;&gt; It's it's for this day. Well, thank God for the things that come in the past because you know what? There's a day when when Martin when when St. Mart uh Martin Luther's message came. See, that was the new birth for their day. That put them in the body. And thank God for that because you know what? The truth of that still is holding today. We still hold to that message today. Just the just shall live by faith. Justification is still an important part of the journey. We still have to have that. But you know what? God didn't stop there because it's time as we go on TO NOT JUST GET PAST JUSTIFICATION, but get to a place where you get sanctified. and you know that you've had a had an experience of sanctification and know that things that you've had in your past are clear from you when the unclean spirit that's inside of a man has been driven out and you know that you've had a change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not some kind of hocus pocus or something, &gt;&gt; not some kind of idea, but you've actually had something that's actually true that you know what experience took place. &gt;&gt; That's right. Something took place inside of you that nobody else can argue out you out of. &gt;&gt; See, God has promised these things to us. See the things Martin Luther Wesley Pentecost. Thank God for the gifts of the spirit. Thank God for the moving of the Holy Spirit, the indwelling of the Holy Spirit to take up residence in us to have to have our own day of Pentecost. Amen. &gt;&gt; Having that same Pentecostal experience that they had back there. &gt;&gt; I know that. I know it took place back there because it took place in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It took I know what it's like. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And not and not worry about, you know, what everybody, you know, if if you don't if you don't believe, that's okay. It ain't changing me, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I pray for you. &gt;&gt; But I know I know what to what took place in me. &gt;&gt; And so we see all these things were promised in the days brother said he promised all these things in the days of others. But he said now he promised us a full square meal. He said the full seven course menu for all the seven seals are open and everything is ready for the word of God to those who can receive it. &gt;&gt; So it's been open to us that we can receive these things and it's it's carried on and thank God that God has revealed these things to us in our day and now we have these things to eat. Not not mana from another day, not meat from another day, but the meat for our day. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said the things of yesterday, he said all of it is rotten. It's no good. &gt;&gt; He said a genuine eagle of this day knows that was all right, but we got that plus &gt;&gt; until Jesus Christ is made manifest in the fullness of his power as he promised to be in this last day. Right? &gt;&gt; So, it's been promised to us that we can take a hold of these things and we can draw from these things and receive these things and become these things. &gt;&gt; These things are ours. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And praise God that we realize that in this day, God has given us the word, but he came through the prophet. But the pro brother Brandham set things in order. God set things in order through the prophet. Through the message, the things were set in order for us to follow. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, then we realize that it becomes through the ministry. And thank God, Brother Brandon was was speaking of how he was speaking in in the message the uncertain sound. And he was talking about coming into the to the meetings and he said, "Thank God for the ministers, different ministers with different types of ministry that it might serve the purpose and might feed the flock which the Holy Spirit has made them overseer." Amen. &gt;&gt; So, there's different types of ministry because there's a five-fold ministry that sits under the prophet's message that's taking these things and they are taking these things and they are preaching these things and breaking these things down to the people and is reaching them. And without that, you're not going to receive exactly what you have need of. &gt;&gt; The problem that people have today is they've turned away from the five-fold ministry. Oh, we don't need that anymore. We need it more today than we ever have. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said because teaching is what's needed. Every every every gift of God is is is needed and is important. If God called you to a place then then it's it behooves us to do our part. &gt;&gt; I was listen to brother Donnie Reagan one time and you know he was talking about you know he said some brothers he said they may never preach some convention. He said they may not do these different things. He said, "They they may just preach occasionally, do these different things behind the scenes or whatever." He said, "But you know what? They're still called of God." And he said, "They're still doing what God called them to do." And he said, "They're still working in the plan of God." &gt;&gt; And he said, "We are we we respect them. &gt;&gt; We ought to give them a respect because God, that's their God's servant." &gt;&gt; Whether it's big or little or whatever, you know what it doesn't matter. The thing is is if we are respectful and honor the position that God has called a man to and honor his calling &gt;&gt; and respect that and the man do his job. &gt;&gt; I thank God for all of our brothers. &gt;&gt; We do we do our part. &gt;&gt; But what brother say? See everybody does their part. It takes a five-fold ministry. Every part is important. It has a every part has its has its place. &gt;&gt; But you know brother Ram said he talking about the preaching. He said preaching catches the sinner and brings him under condemnation to the word. He catches the word and he receives the word. He said but it's teaching. &gt;&gt; He said it's teaching that positionally places you in the body to show you who you are. &gt;&gt; It it's required that you realize who you are. who we are &gt;&gt; because that's what the message of this hour has done to show us who we are and to place us where we need to be. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, because this time is a bride that's mature. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A bride that comes to maturity, comes to the place that God wants us to be. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; See, we must receive these things. We need to grow up on these things and and in this is from the message Christ the mystery. Brother Brandon was talking about the the vision that he had and you know he was he was there and and you know the the Lord wouldn't let him go overseas and and you know they they wanted him to come and he was like no I can't go and he saw the little white boat and he said it was just that one meeting and he said I couldn't go and he said the Lord began to speak to him. He said but store up the food. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said now store up this food. &gt;&gt; He said because it's it'll be it'll be needed later on. He said you need to store up this food. And he said, he said, 'Lord, you know, he said, he said, I've tried to do that, you know, as much as I could, you know, trying sincerely to do these things. And he said, you know, I seen that vision. And he said there, he said, to store up the food, and he said they were bringing it into the tabernacle. And he said, he said, I saw those fine, healthy looking vegetables that I saw in the vision being stored in here in this tabernacle. He said, may we today receive a whole barrel full of that. Grant it, Lord. He said, or a tape load that it might reveal Jesus Christ to us in the hour that we live to give us sustaining strength, the spiritual strength for the task that lays ahead. &gt;&gt; That we receive these things. And so, as brother Brandon began talking about storing up the food, storing up the food. Well, you know what? Now, there's your food that you get into &gt;&gt; and you have to take every bit of these things that that God has for you and get in there and dig and take everything and eat all of it. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Receive all of it. You know, because if you don't have a a balanced diet, you miss out one part of that, one little aspect somewhere, and you're going to have a problem in your growth. &gt;&gt; And people and even the problem that some people have is even when the when the ministry has began to preach and begin to discern these things and tell people exactly what they have need of and show their their place. The problem is is they don't go beyond that and accept that and and take that and say, "Yes, Lord, that's me and I'm just going to accept that and I'm gonna walk in that and I'm gonna eat that and I'm gonna feast on this." Because some people, they just sit there with their arms folded and just stick their tongue, you know, their bottom lip out. &gt;&gt; Well, I can't believe you said that about me. &gt;&gt; WELL, THE PROBLEM IS IS YOU'RE MISSING the Holy Spirit speaking to you. you don't have any rights. &gt;&gt; He said sheep don't have any rights. &gt;&gt; But the problem is is we miss God. God begins to speak to us and and we and not realizing that sometimes it's like, well, I I I don't like that preacher. &gt;&gt; Well, you know what? That's not that that don't really matter anything. &gt;&gt; What did he say? &gt;&gt; Well, I don't like him because he steps on my toes. That's right. &gt;&gt; Well, that's all right. &gt;&gt; Maybe the Lord need to step on your toes some more. &gt;&gt; Like I like I tell everybody, I bought a brand new pair of shoes one time sitting on the front row up here where brother Ryan's at. Brand new pair of shoes. Wore them church one time. I bought them. Wore them church sitting right up here. Brother Dale said, "Brother Aaron wouldn't mind if I step on his toes." And he's always stepping on my brand new shoes. Like I don't mind you stepping on my toes. I just don't want you to step on my new shoes. But see, God knows how to how to reach you. &gt;&gt; He gives you what you have need of. &gt;&gt; And I was like, well, I hope they hope they look all right. But, you know, God knows what he's doing. &gt;&gt; And he gives us what we have need of. And so sometimes when we when we miss these things, we we we see these things that's taking place. Sometimes we miss the things that are taking place and not realize these things are for us. you know, uh was uh went to the doctor few weeks ago and uh the last the last two times they they've done blood work on me. They're telling me some of my numbers are not right. So, um, they they put me on, uh, well, you know, if y'all have my chart, if y if y'all go to the the hospital and you get the my chart and then they they send you this list about this long and all these words and it's like, I don't understand any of it. So, the words you don't, you take a dictionary, you look them up and you start trying to you read up on all this stuff and so, you know, they give you this page and after a while you've you've spent quite a while reading this stuff and trying to become a doctor, a web MD trying to figure out all this stuff. But uh you know they they said well your your iron's a little low and and this is a little low and that's not right and and but you know we won't take you we want you to take iron and they were like you need to take iron take some more iron pills you need to get your blood up hemoglobin up all this kind of stuff you know here but okay well you know I got to reading all this stuff and I just didn't take them and it's like well just take my just take my iron every day like like I'm supposed to pop my iron pop my iron Well, I got to reading I got to digging and that that my chart stuff got to reading on all that stuff. Now he's like, "Well, this is this over here says some word." I was like, "What is that?" So, I go look it up. Oh, well, that's your B vitamins. Oh, okay. So, you multi your complex B vitamins, folate, and all that other stuff. It's like, okay. Start reading on this and oh, this is this like okay. began to read on all this stuff. Come to find out after doing a little research and reading I have two problems whether on on that charge the the two that I'm talking about. But the problem the problem that I have is I have low B vitamins and I have low iron. I told him I said I don't understand that. I like I like eating meat every day. I ate steak all the time. They said, "Well, you have this." Well, here, just take this iron. So, I'm going to take my iron. Well, I got to reading. Well, guess what? You know what helps your body absorb iron? &gt;&gt; You know what helps your body absorb iron? Your B complex vitamins. And guess what is low in my body? B complex vitamins. But just take your iron. And not only if your vitamin your B vitamins are low, your body can't absorb and utilize the iron you have in your body &gt;&gt; because your B vitamins are low. &gt;&gt; And I was like, well, thank you. Well, you know what? I could have took all of the I could have took all the iron that I wanted to. &gt;&gt; Just take the iron. But you know what the problem is? is I needed more than just the iron. &gt;&gt; And so if you're not taking a full balanced diet, if you're not getting every nutrient, if you're not getting every vitamin, if you're not getting every mineral, then guess what? You're off and you can have Oh, just take more of this one. Just take more of this one. Take Well, you know what? That's not going to help. &gt;&gt; Because you're missing the other one. &gt;&gt; I was like, well, you know what? I'm going to self-medicate myself. So, I went out and I started taking B vitamins, multivitamins, trying to eat things that's got vitamins in it. And it's like, well, you know what? I got all this other stuff. Well, you know, I can pop all the iron I want to. &gt;&gt; But if there but if it's not in your body to utilize it, then your body's going to reject it. &gt;&gt; Your body's going to lose it. It ain't going to be able to absorb it. &gt;&gt; That's right. And it's the same thing in the word of God. &gt;&gt; If we don't take every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God &gt;&gt; and we don't take everything in complimentary portion, &gt;&gt; then if you have one and it's like, oh, I just I just I just I just love them evangelists. I just love that fiery preacher. But you know what the problem is? If when you begin to get to a certain place, then you know what? You've not had any teaching. And you've and you've missed out. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And everybody's like, "Well, you know what? I don't I don't I don't need a pastor. I just I just sit and just speak to the Lord and I just listen to the prophet." Well, how many times did the did he say, "You need a post of duty, you need a pastor, you need a you need a church." No, I just go get in my boat and I float out on the water and read my Bible on Sunday morning. &gt;&gt; I had a man tell me that before. Head church on the water. Really? Forsake not the assembling of yourselves together? Who else are you assembling with? The fish in the water. the birds in the air. &gt;&gt; See, it's important that we be together. &gt;&gt; And everybody likes to think we're we're just an we're just an army of one, but you know what? We're really not. &gt;&gt; We're a soldier in the army of the Lord, and it takes every one of us. You don't you don't fulfill everything and I don't fulfill everything. &gt;&gt; I do my part, you do your part. We're a body. &gt;&gt; It's a body ministry. &gt;&gt; We minister to one another. We help one another. &gt;&gt; And so, everybody has to do their part to compleiment each other. &gt;&gt; And if you're going to if you're going to grow and have the right kind of growth, then you know what? The things that you don't like, well, that's the things that you need. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right. &gt;&gt; Because, you know, I I have I have I have two boys. Everybody knows. I have have one that eats he has he likes a variety of things. He eats things I don't even like. But, you know, I mean, he he likes he likes a lot of things that that I I would skip, but you know, he he likes salads and lot other stuff. And then uh the other one he you can put all the vegetables he likes I think on one hand. You can count them on one hand but you know he likes fruit. But you know you you look at but you know one he likes to eat a little healthier. The other one is like, you know, um, like I I I think he could live on fast food. But you you you see the the the kind of life that the things that you're eating, you can eat these things because they taste good. You like these things, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But the problem is is is it giving you the nourishment that you need? Are you getting are you getting everything that you you have need of? &gt;&gt; It's like, well, well, I don't like this and I don't like that. Well, you know what? You need to find the things that sustain you. &gt;&gt; Cuz let me tell you something. If the Holy Ghost is on the inside and the Holy Ghost is leading you and the word is being born in you and you're manifesting the word, the bride of Jesus Christ is to bring forth Jesus Christ. Right? &gt;&gt; Then you go out and you find a mother that's carrying a baby and when she needs certain things in her diet. Oh, I hate that. Then all of a sudden, guess what? There's a change that takes place and the things that Well, you know what? I never like turnipss or whatever. And all of a sudden, you know, I JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH of them. &gt;&gt; And you know what? And I never like this boy. I just I'm I'm just eating I just I just love it. I just can't just can't get enough of it. Just eat and eat. Why? Because that's what's needed in the body. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And if you're going to have Jesus Christ in your life, if you're going to manifest Jesus Christ, then the things that's inside of you, then the word is calling for those things, then he's because brother Brandham said, he said the Holy Ghost is on the inside waiting for you to bring him the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then if he if he's on the inside, then he's going to be calling out for those things and you say, "Well, you know, I don't like that." But you know what? If there's an expression of God on the inside, you're going to be calling, "Lord, that's what I need. Lord, I want these things because that's what I need to grow." &gt;&gt; When it becomes a place when you begin to realize, I need this. This is what's lacking in my life. This is where I need to grow, Lord. Then help me. then El Shadai is there &gt;&gt; and you can begin to nurse &gt;&gt; to get all the nourishment that you have need of &gt;&gt; as Jesus said, "Man shall not live by bread alone, &gt;&gt; but by every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this evening. Let's all stand. We'll have the musicians come. I want to receive all that God has for me. &gt;&gt; I don't want to I don't want to be malnourished. I don't want to bring forth anything. I want I want to be a full healthy Christian. Lord, give me the things that I have need of. Amen. God bless you tonight. Let's sing a song. Oh, reach out and touch the Lord as he passes by. &gt;&gt; You You'll find he's not too busy to hear your heart's cry. For he is pass and by this moment your needs he'll supply.

Shine on me. Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me. Oh my wonderful message. Let's give our brother a wonderful hand. You know, I pray that that light will shine on all of us. I was uh as Aaron said, I went to sleep in a deer stand. I was actually watching the service. So, I finally got some I got some good reception and I I had to hold it up like this, but I could get the the service. And I sitting there and it was 17° and you know when that light will shine on you, what does it do? It warms you up &gt;&gt; every time. Doesn't matter if it's 5°. If you get in the ray of a sunlight, it will instantly warm you up. So in this cold, dark world that we live in, there's one ray of light and he's shining on each one of us. &gt;&gt; If you have the Holy Ghost today, God's shining his light on you. &gt;&gt; He promised he'd never leave us. He'd never forsake us. He'd never leave. Listen, this world is cold. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a cold world, but you and I are the only light in this whole world. We're the only people that have the true light. &gt;&gt; And we sure appreciate all of you. Thank you for this weekend. Um, looking out. Brother David did a wonderful job. I finally figured out what a shind dig was. I uh I asked told him I said what I know what that is now. I didn't know what it was and I do now. But uh it was good to have brother David with us. And just remember this weekend brother Luis will be speaking for you. I'm going to be at brother Richard Wilson's. He's been asking me since September to come and preach for him.

Brother Daryl Ward will be ministering for us at 3:00 on Saturday. And then we'll be regular service on Sunday. Saturday there will be a meal afterwards. So it'll start at 3:00.

So, we sure do appreciate them coming. Appreciate you coming, buddy. And come back and visit anytime you want to. You're welcome anytime. So, all minds and hearts clear. You love the Lord. Just remember that this coming weekend, uh, Brother Luis will be speaking, brother I'll be at brother Richard Wilson's. And then, uh, the next Sunday, Brother Daryl Ward will be with us. And then starting on January the 25th, uh, we will start on our series on the seals on January the 25th, which will be the last Sunday this month. And uh we uh appreciate your prayers and support. Uh brother um Isaac and them from Ohio. They are going to um not have their service during that time and they're going to stream in just like they used to before. But they're hungry. They want to know. They want to hear. So we want to hear, too. &gt;&gt; I want to get as much out of this as you get out of this. But I just believe, and I'm going to tell you real quick, I believe this is the last push &gt;&gt; to get us out of here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you're not happy about it, you need the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; If you love this world and the things of this world, the love of God is not in you. &gt;&gt; Now, there's a lot of things I like to do and there's a lot of things you like to do that are human. &gt;&gt; But if we don't put God first, folks, I'm telling you, we're in bad shape. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; If we don't put his his kingdom above our kingdom, &gt;&gt; then we're in trouble. His kingdom always is first. The kingdom of God is eternal. &gt;&gt; The kingdom down here is not. &gt;&gt; But remember, we're we're not time. We're cap we're trapped in time, but we're not time creatures. &gt;&gt; That's why it's going to be easy for us to slip over into eternity one day, and we'll get out of here. Let let uh the world burn itself up. Um, I was, uh, the guys I was hunting with, it was about, uh, six of them, I think, were from, uh, New York and New Jersey and Maine and and Pennsylvania. And there was no Southerners there at all, except me, me and Mike, the guy that went with me, and and we had a discussion. I just want to tell you how the world is. The world the world thinks if they're just good, they're going to heaven. &gt;&gt; That's right. They drank their liquor. They drank their martinis. They cursed every sentence. They cursed. But they were Roman Catholics. And they said, and we had a discussion about why me and and Mike didn't do the things that they did and why it was wrong for them to do it. Well, you ought to have heard all these discussions because they were very educated. One was a gynecologist, one was a dentist, one ran some kind of big um um what is it? Um plumbing place up north somewhere. They were highly educated people, but they couldn't understand. All they think is he said, "My priest will will get me through. &gt;&gt; My priest will get me through &gt;&gt; and it don't matter what I do or say. I can go to the priest." And one of them looked at me and he said, "I'm faithful and I'm good to people." And I started to say, "So was Judas." But I didn't. I wanted to still wanted to hunt with them. They had guns, so I wanted to still hunt with them. So I I just kind of looked at him and I said, "A lot of times goodness is not good enough. &gt;&gt; You got to have a birth." Like brother Aaron said, you got to know that you know that you know &gt;&gt; you got to have a change in your life. That's right. &gt;&gt; And they don't understand that. They don't want to change. They don't want the Lord to be the Lord of their life. They just want to know who Jesus is and know who the Catholic Church is. And I I'm sorry for those people, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I feel sorry for them in my heart. I do. I it grieves me bad to know that there's I just met six people from up north and I ain't saying nothing about Yankees but but they're just all Catholics and they just all drink and they they have no sense of of Christianity, true Christianity. Why? They've been told what Christianity was. &gt;&gt; They've never experienced true Christianity. So, I hope that with me and Mike was there and that Mike's a guy that does a catering here at here at the church and him and his wife and and to be just a nominal Christian. He's a devout Christian. Uh doesn't drink, smoke, cuss or and he talks about the Lord all the time and and we sure do appreciate that. But just remember this world, there's people in this world that's looking for God. And like brother Aaron said, the only way he's going to see is you. &gt;&gt; Only way they're going to see God is you. That's right. &gt;&gt; So, let's just let's make sure this year we sharpen our pencil, we study more, we pray more because if we don't, we're not going to get out of here, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We've got to do more than we've ever done before. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; To get out of here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But this is the last This is the This is the last course that we're going to take. I just believe this year is going to show who's going to make it and who's not. And I just pray by the by the word of the Lord and the prayer of faith that we're all going to make it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're going to preach our heart out starting in January, January 25th. And we're going to really try to uh to break those seals down because without that, we will not have the redemption of our body. &gt;&gt; We'll all just keep getting older and dying and going by the grave. And you can believe that if you want to. It's just come to me that it doesn't matter what you believe. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's what God tells us and we believe him. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Our own opinion from now on has got us nowhere. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Our opinions is what got us killed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, let's take his opinion because it's always right. &gt;&gt; Never is wrong. &gt;&gt; He'll never steer you in the wrong direction. So, let's live our sermon though. Let's live our Christianity this year. &gt;&gt; Let's live our faith. &gt;&gt; You know, that's what the guy said. He's just He said, "Well, I'm faithful." I said, "Faithful to what? If that's all we got to live for is the way those guys live. I mean, come on. There's life after this. &gt;&gt; There's real life after this. This But we got to go through this. &gt;&gt; This is our testing ground. This is our place that we got to come to to get out of here." &gt;&gt; And he gave us the message to do it with. There's no other message that's going to change our body. Not other another message. There's not a denomination. There's not anything in this world going to change our body except the bride accepting what he sent through a prophet and God revealing that to us individually, but together we can what? We can worship &gt;&gt; that God's in our midst. &gt;&gt; So, we love you and appreciate you. miss you this weekend and and uh we were um watching in and we we appreciate the uh time God gave us to kind of study a little bit on how to what direction to go in when we start there in January. And I pray that we'll all all from this day forward think of God more often. Think of think of just sit down and think. Maybe sometimes maybe we do need to just sit down in a in a place. You don't have to sit in a deer stand, but sit in a place somewhere and just just reflect on what God's done for you. &gt;&gt; And then reflect on what he can do for you more &gt;&gt; than he's done for you before. &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz he have he he can. Brother Ram said, "Ask for big things." So this year we're going to ask God for big things. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're going to ask for our family. &gt;&gt; We're going to ask for our wayward loved ones. We're going to ask for all these things. And we're going to ask expecting that that's going to take place in God's time. not our time, but in God's time. &gt;&gt; So, God bless you. Let's uh bow our heads and we'll dismiss in a word of prayer. Just remember this weekend be with brother Luis and speak in a word. I'll be speaking next Wednesday. Uh Lord willing. So, just pray for us as we go to brother Richards and have a a weekend with them. So, dear heavenly father, Lord, what a sermon. Lord, thank you so much, Lord, for our brother pouring his heart out, Lord, that we need those spiritual vitamins, Lord. And the only way we're going to get them is we're going to have to put them in our mouth. And Lord, out of this word, we're going to have what it takes to get us out of here. It'll be that vitamin that'll change our body. But Lord, we won't. If we don't take it, it will do us no good. We must take the vitamin before it can do us any good. Father, just be with each one. I know we got sick among us. Mom over there, you know, with a strep throat. Father, I pray that you'd be with her, Lord. She wasn't here tonight with us. But, Lord, that we can all overcome these things, the little things that are bothering us, Lord, and we'll kick those things out the door and start this new year, Lord, Lord, more dedicated to you, Father. Because there will come a time where there's going to be a rapture. And there's going to be a time, Lord, where we have to come to a place to where we believe you more than even our own body because it all is denying you, Lord. But father, that one thing inside of us, that eternal life, that new birth, Lord, it never will deny you. It will always agree with the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Father, just I pray that all that will come for come come forward this year, Lord, and that we'll live a better, more uh productive Christian life, Father. Just be with the people, Father, on the way home. Bless each one, Lord, as they go back to school and they go back to work, Lord. Just be with them and bless them, Father. just continue to be with the church here, Father, and the ones listening in, Lord, from all over the world. Lord, I pray that you'd be with them, Father. Bless us now in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. You're dismissed. &gt;&gt; So glad I'm yours, Lord. So glad I'm yours, Lord. So glad your mercy has followed me. I'm so glad you found me and you set me free. So glad I'm yours, Lord. So glad I'm yours.
