[8:45] know it is true that there's all types
[8:47] of judgment um going around last night I
[8:51] was reading an article off of one of the
[8:52] news websites and I guess last week or
[8:56] um yeah it was sometime this week they
[8:58] they had the Glo it's like global awards
[9:00] or something in in Los Los Angeles there
[9:04] and this article was talking about how I
[9:06] didn't watch it but they had the video
[9:08] clip there and I guess one of the
[9:10] announcers she was you know people they
[9:13] win Awards and they get up and have
[9:15] their speeches and they'll say I thank
[9:16] God I think this person this person and
[9:19] she actually showed she said we're going
[9:22] to take a poll of uh who all she said
[9:25] and it is the wording of it that was
[9:26] very strange she said these speeches are
[9:28] on fire and we're going to take a poll
[9:30] of how many people thinked you know
[9:32] their mother and this and they came up
[9:35] with God and it said zero and everybody
[9:37] laughed and she said it's no surprise in
[9:40] in this Godless
[9:42] town and one day later the fires broke
[9:44] out now they've always had fires out

[9:49] of the historic worst fires and so the

[10:14] the day of Pentecost it's it's the honey
[10:15] and The Rock and uh we thank God for the
[10:18] pillar of fire it's not to judge us but

[25:41] man of the flu but we're not talking to
[25:45] man today we're talking to a god that
[25:47] can do all things and heal all of our
[25:50] diseases so Lord we place them in your
[25:52] hands father that you would raise them
[25:54] up for your honor and Glory so be with

[26:12] their heart so that they'll come to you
[26:14] father we ask these things in Jesus name
[26:18] and the bride says amen so we're we're
[26:21] talking about they still in the
[26:23] transition to per Perfection this will
[26:25] be part eight we'll talk a little bit
[26:27] today about the Mysteries because that's
[26:29] what we have to get into to get into the
[26:31] meat of the message to get into the to
[26:34] the Malachi 4 second part of it you have
[26:36] to deal with the Mysteries and let me
[26:39] tell you
[26:40] something the Bible tells us we can
[26:42] understand it
[26:44] amen the soul always knows what to do to
[26:47] heal itself the challenge is to silence
[26:49] your
[26:52] mind how do we
[26:54] overcome we overcome by what the blood
[26:56] of the lamb and our testimony which
[26:58] comes from our brain that we're
[26:59] testifying good things not bad things
[27:02] all right so let's read 1 Corinthians
[27:06] 2:9 you see that okay but as it is
[27:09] written I have not seen nor ear heard
[27:11] neither have entered into the heart of
[27:12] man the things which God hath prepared
[27:15] for them that love him what a promise
[27:18] amen but God hath revealed them unto us
[27:22] by his spirit for the spirit now may not
[27:26] be that we do
[27:28] hello but the spirit inside of you is
[27:31] what
[27:32] searches for the Deep things of God it
[27:35] should in this end time but for the
[27:38] spirit searches all things yay the Deep
[27:40] things of God for what man knoweth the
[27:43] things of a man now watch save the
[27:45] spirit of man which is in him I can
[27:46] relate to man because I'm a
[27:48] man or Humanity I can relate to humanity
[27:52] cuz I'm a human all right now even so
[27:55] the things of God knoweth no man but the
[27:57] spirit of God so the spirit of God's got
[27:59] to be inside of you so that you can
[28:01] understand God that's right all right
[28:03] now we have received not the spirit of
[28:07] the world but the spirit which is of god
[28:09] that we might know look that we might
[28:12] know the things that are freely given to
[28:15] us of God one more before we sit down
[28:18] Matthew 13:5 I thought this was this was
[28:21] very
[28:22] striking some fell this is a a parable
[28:25] of the sword some fell upon Stony places
[28:29] where they had not much Earth and forth
[28:31] with they sprung up because they had no
[28:34] deepness of Earth now if you look in the
[28:37] strong concordance that is translated to
[28:41] the depth of
[28:42] God so because they had no depth of God
[28:46] when the sun came up they were scorched
[28:50] and because they had no root they
[28:52] withered away you may be seated the Lord
[28:55] that his Blessing to the reading the
[28:56] word I thought that was striking because
[28:58] when you go to that word depth of
[29:01] God or the Deep things of God it goes to
[29:04] the word deepness which comes here in
[29:06] Matthew and that's exactly the truth
[29:09] some
[29:10] are falling by the wayside now
[29:14] because the Heat's
[29:16] coming the Heat's here if you're not
[29:19] ready for the S so n the Su n but the s
[29:24] o n if you're not ready for the s o n
[29:26] you're going to get scorched
[29:28] amen is that all right I don't want to
[29:30] scare anybody but listen there's time
[29:32] when we got to get out of here and
[29:34] getting out of here if it's just the way
[29:36] it is now we should already be gone but
[29:39] we're not we're still here that's right
[29:41] we're still what we're trying to get the
[29:44] Deep things of God into our soul so that
[29:47] it can work its way out and then we can
[29:49] live the life that God always wanted us
[29:52] to live now we'll look at that here a
[29:54] little bit later down through here on
[29:55] some of the Mysteries that we're going
[29:57] to get started on starting in a couple
[30:00] of weeks Matthew
[30:03] 17:9 as they came down from the mountain
[30:05] Jesus charged him saying tell division
[30:08] to know man until the son of man be
[30:10] risen again from the dead in other words
[30:13] he was describing to him I'm going to
[30:15] die here physically but there's going to
[30:17] be a time that when the son of man's
[30:19] going to be killed again amen
[30:25] amen and his disciples asked him saying
[30:28] why then say the scribes that Elias must
[30:30] first come so so the Lord is telling us
[30:34] by the holy spirit that we're going to
[30:37] have a place and time on Earth where
[30:41] there's going to be an Elijah come an
[30:43] Elijah Ministry come and restore us back
[30:46] to the faith of the fathers restore us
[30:50] back to the original word now listen
[30:52] there's going to be a group that's going
[30:54] to carry us away from
[30:56] that denomination
[31:01] a li truly shall first come and restore
[31:04] all things now in other words to restore
[31:06] something like brother Donnie had gets
[31:08] an old car I remember they got an old
[31:10] 30s something Cadillac in one time and
[31:12] that was the ugliest thing I ever seen
[31:14] in my life the tires wasn't even on it
[31:16] they were laying up on the top of
[31:18] it but you give some
[31:21] master the right tools and give him the
[31:24] right parts and give him the right time
[31:27] to do it in he will absolutely restore
[31:32] that whole car and it will become a
[31:33] beautiful car they don't make them like
[31:35] they used to
[31:37] before that was a that was I what y'all
[31:40] do with that brother Donnie that big old
[31:42] Cadillac thing y'all got in had that
[31:43] like V10 the engine was about this long
[31:45] and it had a wheel in the back and cloth
[31:48] on top it it was it was fine for the
[31:51] time but it looked like time had took
[31:52] its
[31:53] toll but if you take it and give it to
[31:55] somebody a master builder he will
[31:58] restore it back and that's what God sent
[32:00] us he sent us a master builder to
[32:01] restore what had been eroded down
[32:04] through the church ages by man right now
[32:07] not by God by man you put man in every
[32:11] equation he
[32:15] falls he can't even keep a covenant
[32:18] right we can't keep a covenant I trust
[32:20] in God's covenant right cuz it's an
[32:22] unconditional Covenant it's a covenant
[32:24] that says I'm going to do this I will
[32:28] will change your body you won't be able
[32:30] to change it God's going to have to
[32:31] change it
[32:33] amen so let's quit trusting in oursel
[32:36] trust in God Amen so God did send us
[32:39] Elijah the prophet Malachi 4 he sent us
[32:42] Elijah number four before the great and
[32:44] Dreadful day of the Lord we see now the
[32:47] Dreadful day of the Lord is coming it's
[32:48] it's here amen and he shall turn the
[32:52] heart of the fathers to the children and
[32:54] the Heart of the children to their
[32:56] fathers lest I come and smite the Earth
[32:57] Earth with the curse now we know that
[33:00] Elijah number three which was John the
[33:02] Baptist he turned the heart now listen
[33:04] what is the heart
[33:08] soul you can change things
[33:12] physically but unless you change the
[33:14] soul you're
[33:16] dead you can look good you can fix
[33:19] yourself up you can get
[33:21] BOTOX whatever you want to
[33:23] get you're still going to be old but
[33:26] I'll promise you once you get get the
[33:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul
[33:29] you'll never be old again you will never
[33:32] ever be old again you will be
[33:34] Eternal for eternity am and you'll start
[33:38] it right here go this is that Elijah
[33:40] ministry that's coming now we don't need
[33:42] that Elijah listen we will not need that
[33:45] Elijah Ministry number
[33:48] five right it's not to
[33:51] us it's to Israel right we have to have
[33:55] number four because he's to the G genes
[33:59] that Elijah is preaching to the
[34:01] Gentiles and bringing a people out a
[34:04] bride in the end time that's going to be
[34:08] turned back from their old
[34:11] ways and brother brandom Comon as we're
[34:14] going to see in a minute when he
[34:15] indicted this generation he just didn't
[34:18] indict a generation he indicted them all
[34:21] the way from Calvary to today I mean to
[34:25] today because remember when a prophet
[34:27] speak he speaks behind present forward
[34:32] amen and that's what we're looking at
[34:34] today the word of God is what Jesus
[34:35] Christ the same yesterday today and
[34:38] forever so we can stand today like I
[34:40] said before there is no way that I can
[34:43] indict a generation brother brandham had
[34:45] to do it a prophet had to do it by the
[34:47] word of God by the opening of the seals
[34:50] he indicted a generation now remember an
[34:53] indictment brings you into
[34:56] court right then you have to have a
[34:58] trial right then you have to have what
[35:03] conviction or not amen then you have to
[35:06] have someone to carry out the
[35:10] sentencing everybody with me now all
[35:13] right bring them into court indict them
[35:17] give them the evidence this is what's
[35:20] happening everybody with me all right
[35:24] then you come over here and you got to
[35:25] bring the evidence which we know brother
[35:27] ROM did his whole message is the
[35:30] evidence that they fell away from their
[35:32] first love his whole message was they
[35:35] turned away from the true Living God
[35:37] right then you got to have a conviction
[35:40] and he convicted them that day when he
[35:42] said I indict you for crucifying christ
[35:44] and then he proved that they crucified
[35:47] him amen he proved by the word of God he
[35:50] didn't prove by Brother bram's
[35:54] message he proved it by the word of God
[35:57] amen now we prove it by the word of God
[36:00] and we see it in the message of the hour
[36:02] but let me give you a secret brother
[36:04] brandom's off the scene
[36:06] now there was a
[36:10] conviction who's going to carry out the
[36:18] sentence brother randam can't carry it
[36:21] out somebody's going to carry it out
[36:23] right here cuz it's this it's an
[36:25] indictment that they're crucifying
[36:28] today aresh and put him to an open shame
[36:32] even the people in the message that are
[36:33] preaching false Doctrine they're doing
[36:35] the same thing this is not just for
[36:36] denomination folks you preach a false
[36:39] Doctrine you're killing Jesus Christ
[36:41] right that's why everything's got to be
[36:43] right that's what brother and I were
[36:44] talking the other day we've got to
[36:47] realize I know there's different message
[36:49] churches I know there's different
[36:51] factions and there's different ideas but
[36:54] I'll promise you one thing look at me
[36:57] just for a minute the son of man never
[37:00] had an argument with the father
[37:04] righten exactly he never said now I
[37:07] don't know if he meant that or
[37:10] not now if the son of man Ministry is to
[37:13] be right here today alive and among us
[37:17] today there can't be any error right not
[37:22] one word Jesus came back to get us out
[37:25] of the garden of and put us back in the
[37:26] Garden of Eden with that one word that
[37:29] got us out right amen he said you
[37:33] believe in
[37:34] me believe in me and I'll take you back
[37:38] there but man said no I don't want any
[37:40] of that I want my own ideas I want to do
[37:43] it my own
[37:44] way is that not
[37:47] right so brother R took this from Luke
[37:49] 23:33 he said when they were come to the
[37:52] place which is called Calvary There They
[37:54] Crucified him and the maleactors one on
[37:57] the right and one on the left now
[37:59] remember there where the most religious
[38:02] city right they the most religious
[38:04] people not the Sinners and prostitutes
[38:06] and robbers
[38:09] thieves crucified the most horrible
[38:11] death that could be of that time that
[38:12] was the most horrible
[38:14] death him the one that didn't ever need
[38:16] to be crucified never had a never had a
[38:20] uh a day where he was a
[38:24] sinner but he became sin for us
[38:28] he took on our sin when he went to
[38:29] Calvary he said I'll do it but he said
[38:33] not my will but thy will be done well
[38:35] now remember that wasn't a
[38:37] fight CU he went to Calvary brother
[38:40] Brown said he fought it out in
[38:41] Gethsemane he didn't win at the cross he
[38:43] went he win he won in
[38:46] Gethsemane what when he got on his knees
[38:48] and prayed and said father let this cup
[38:50] pass for me but
[38:52] nevertheless not my will but thy will be
[38:55] done can we say that today never
[38:57] nevertheless does it come what may not
[38:59] my will but thy will be done can you lay
[39:02] it on the altar today can we lay it down
[39:05] and say this is it right here amen oh my
[39:09] brother Lise he was a Pentecostal
[39:10] Wednesday night that was a good sermon
[39:13] yes sir that was good I enjoyed that I
[39:15] like when people get
[39:17] excited amen what do we get excited
[39:20] about what was said the word of God that
[39:23] he brought is what we get excited about
[39:25] not because he was jumping around
[39:30] so brother Brown comes and
[39:32] he forms an
[39:34] indictment now this word indictment
[39:37] means a formal charge or
[39:39] accusation of a serious crime now for a
[39:44] traffic violation you don't get
[39:47] indicted you go before the court you pay
[39:49] the fine or you or you contested or
[39:51] whatever more but if you have a serious
[39:54] crime capital offense or a federal
[39:56] offense or a felony or something of that
[39:59] sort that's a serious crime they must
[40:02] indict you according to the evidence
[40:07] that's
[40:08] given now brother brandom he all through
[40:10] his time he was he was bearing with them
[40:13] and bearing with them and bearing with
[40:15] them I talking to a brother the other
[40:18] day uh Brother David gadman and a couple
[40:20] others who were standing around when we
[40:21] went over to to uh to Brother David
[40:24] templeton's the other night we were
[40:26] talking about about
[40:28] this I asked him I said
[40:31] look I'm going in March to preach for a
[40:34] a Methodist Church if you got a problem
[40:36] with that you got a problem if brother
[40:39] ryham would have said I ain't going to
[40:40] them places the problem is that you're
[40:42] so weak you're afraid you're going to
[40:44] get something when you go there they
[40:46] ain't way they ain't going to see
[40:47] nothing but God when I go over
[40:49] there and Brother David Gman said I
[40:52] preach for Baptist Church another
[40:53] brother standing there he said well I
[40:54] preach for the Pentecostal Church
[40:57] I don't have a problem with that would
[40:59] you have a problem with it I didn't
[41:01] think
[41:03] so but do what take me with you take
[41:08] okay well we're going March the 30th
[41:09] down to Silver shs in Commerce and and
[41:12] uh okay I'm not going to preach There
[41:15] They Crucified him I'll promise you
[41:18] that but I'll guarantee you there'll be
[41:21] some things they never heard
[41:23] before and they asked me to come I
[41:25] didn't get at the front door and go can
[41:27] I preach for you come on I'm sure glad
[41:30] as I say before I'm glad brother
[41:31] brandham didn't say bless God I'm not
[41:33] going to them denominations no here's my
[41:35] point from 47 to 63 that's where he was
[41:39] at there was no message church at all he
[41:43] had to preach in the free will he had to
[41:45] preach in the Baptist he had to preach
[41:47] in the Methodist how do he get armman
[41:49] Neville he got him out of a Methodist
[41:51] Church did he not right so don't be
[41:54] afraid that listen if you got the
[41:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul
[41:58] there's no one no one on earth going to
[42:01] change your
[42:03] mind no one I don't care if you sit in a
[42:06] Methodist church and they give you
[42:07] Methodist Doctrine you ain't going to
[42:09] sit there long no you're just not going
[42:11] to sit there
[42:13] long right right I'm glad Jesus listen
[42:17] Jesus tried to go to the religious
[42:19] people of the world he preached to them
[42:21] but they hated
[42:22] him so there was and listen brother
[42:25] random was fine we'll read it here we
[42:27] read it many times before when brother
[42:29] Brandon first started his ministry he
[42:31] was wise as a serpent and harmless as a
[42:34] dove when Jesus Christ started his
[42:36] ministry if you if you all that are
[42:38] watching The Chosen he started out real
[42:41] quiet he got his disciples together but
[42:44] I'm going to tell you something you get
[42:46] in about the end of season three to
[42:47] season 4 he said it's fixing to get bad
[42:52] why because he come he said I have
[42:54] something to do Jesus said I have
[42:55] something to do
[42:58] I have lived with you long enough even
[43:00] told the Pharisees he said have I not
[43:02] been among you in the temple have I not
[43:04] walked among you what's the problem
[43:07] now he said oh you're making yourself
[43:12] God he was trying to get them to believe
[43:14] he was God he came exactly the way he
[43:17] was supposed to come brother brandham
[43:19] came exactly the way he was supposed to
[43:21] come listen one more time you and I came
[43:24] exactly the way we're supposed to come
[43:26] you and I bring it personal you and I
[43:28] came the exact way we were supposed to
[43:30] come there's no other way you could have
[43:32] come this is it
[43:34] right doesn't matter what you well my
[43:37] past and I don't know my dad and I don't
[43:39] forget that Paul said forgetting the
[43:41] past Paul had to forget a lot because
[43:44] Paul looked at those Christians and
[43:46] called them blasphemers and put them in
[43:49] prison the very ones that he's preaching
[43:51] to now that's right so it's a formal
[43:55] charge or accusation of a serious crime
[43:59] listen eternal life is serious that's
[44:02] right being right is
[44:06] serious a thing that that serves to
[44:09] illustrate that a system or situation is
[44:13] bad and deserves to be condemned brother
[44:17] Ron was preaching 47 to 63 but remember
[44:20] 1959 he preached why am I against
[44:22] organized religion why I am against
[44:24] organized religion and he kind of if
[44:27] you'll watch that he kind of little
[44:29] vanilla there you know he was kind of
[44:31] laying it out there but I'm telling you
[44:32] in 1963 when the seals broke I told you
[44:35] the indictment was not preached until
[44:37] two or three months after the seals open
[44:40] he said he was going to do it in January
[44:42] he said he was going to do in December
[44:44] he had to work wake all wait all the way
[44:46] through March and April May June July he
[44:49] brought the indictment down I'm telling
[44:52] you only a prophet can bring an
[44:54] indictment right to a group of religious
[44:57] people because who was the greatest
[44:58] prophet in the world that was Jesus
[45:02] Christ he brought an
[45:08] indictment
[45:09] condemned deserves to be condemned now
[45:14] listen not the people the system right
[45:17] but you got to remember one thing if you
[45:20] stay in that system you are that system
[45:23] the system only works if people are
[45:25] there amen amen if every Baptist was
[45:27] quit being Baptist there'd be empty
[45:29] Baptist churches around here but they're
[45:31] not they're caught up in the system and
[45:33] you know who's going to be condemned
[45:35] number one is the people in the pull
[45:38] pit the people in the pull pit that's
[45:40] why if you want to stand back here have
[45:42] at it it's not a nice place to
[45:46] be
[45:49] right my words are on trial just as much
[45:51] as everybody else's is
[45:57] so 1962 this is in
[45:59] December brother Brown preached a
[46:01] reproach for the cause of the
[46:04] word Jesus called them Hypocrites you
[46:07] build the tombs of the prophets and
[46:08] you're the one that put them there they
[46:10] come with the word of
[46:13] God and you didn't believe them you're
[46:16] guilty of every one of them at Phoenix
[46:17] God willing I hit a word the other day
[46:19] I'm going to indict this generation for
[46:21] Killing Jesus Christ now who's Jesus
[46:25] Christ he's the word all right so they
[46:28] didn't physically care Jesus you know
[46:29] that they killed the word the effects of
[46:32] the word crucifying him aresh I'm going
[46:34] to bring an indictment before that
[46:36] Ministerial Association now remember he
[46:39] wanted to get a bunch of ministers
[46:40] together cuz that's where the problem
[46:43] is remember what brother rown said he
[46:45] said the only problems I have is when I
[46:47] get around preachers now he said that I
[46:50] didn't they are guilty of the blood of
[46:53] Jesus Christ for crucifying him aresh in
[46:56] indict the
[46:58] whole Peter indicted him on the day of
[47:00] Pentecost he said you with Wicked hands
[47:02] have crucified the Prince of Life who
[47:04] God raised up we Are Witnesses he
[47:06] brought an indictment I'm going to take
[47:08] now remember he didn't just say I'm
[47:09] going to indict you because I'm William
[47:11] Mar brandham I'm God's Prophet for the
[47:13] end time no he did not he said I'm going
[47:18] to take the word of God and indict every
[47:20] denomination there is and every man on
[47:23] the face of the Earth that's guilty of
[47:26] the blood of Jesus Christ God helped me
[47:28] to be his attorney at that day he's the
[47:31] only one that could be the attorney cuz
[47:32] remember God only reveals things to the
[47:35] prophet first so he revealed it to the
[47:38] prophet first but now listen it don't
[47:40] stop there Amos 3 and9 or what at 2 or
[47:43] nine whatever it was that didn't just
[47:45] well God's going to reveal it to the
[47:46] prophets and then brother Jose we just
[47:48] got we're just sitting
[47:49] here no he gave it out to a group of
[47:52] people 1100 sermons were were taped so
[47:56] so that you and I could take that
[47:58] message and we can carry it on to the
[48:00] coming of the Lord yes sir we are here
[48:03] today the messenger is not but the voice
[48:07] of the message is
[48:08] here the final voice I'll show you what
[48:12] in a minute I'll prove to you who's
[48:15] going to carry out the sentence cuz you
[48:17] got if you have a sentencing right if
[48:20] you have an indictment and then you have
[48:22] evidence then you have a conviction you
[48:24] got to carry out the sentence remember
[48:26] the conviction comes on a day not the
[48:30] sentencing you never been to court
[48:32] before just watch every once in a while
[48:33] don't watch Court
[48:35] TV Judge Judy is not a judge she's a
[48:39] she's a actor she is a judge but all
[48:42] that's garbage but if you take a regular
[48:44] process once there's a conviction the
[48:46] judge will stand up and say on such and
[48:49] such day it could be two months from
[48:52] now right cuz they got to have some
[48:55] little things in there that are that are
[48:56] the legality of it then we'll have the
[48:58] sentencing on a certain day well brother
[49:00] bandam convicted
[49:02] them there's no doubt but there had to
[49:05] be a sentence carried out and the
[49:08] sentence had to be carried out not in
[49:10] another dimension right
[49:13] right think about
[49:15] it my indictment is against the churches
[49:18] of today now this is not this is the
[49:20] indictment so here we go and my
[49:23] indictment is against the churches of
[49:24] today now I'm not bringing the center
[49:26] into this I ain't just speaking this to
[49:29] the church it's to be on tape now I'll
[49:31] try to get through as quick as I can I
[49:33] indict this generation the second
[49:35] crucifixion of Jesus Christ and now to
[49:38] do this in this age that we live in I
[49:41] must show an
[49:43] Evidence can't just indict he got to
[49:45] show an Evidence if I have to bring an
[49:48] indictment you have to show an Evidence
[49:50] of the criminal offense that has been
[49:52] done I have to indict them I have to
[49:55] bring the evidence to prove it that it
[49:58] is that what I'm
[50:02] saying look how confident he is what I'm
[50:05] saying will stand
[50:08] up before the main judge right wow which
[50:14] I take myself as an attorney on this
[50:16] indictment that the word of God being my
[50:18] witness I indict this generation for the
[50:21] crucifixion I must show and will show
[50:24] that The Same Spirit is on the people
[50:25] today that brought the first crucifixion
[50:28] that's a
[50:29] mouthful that's a revelation you mean
[50:32] that same yes that same spirit that
[50:35] confronted Jesus on the
[50:37] road in out in and out of
[50:40] Jerusalem in and out of Judea Bethlehem
[50:42] all those different places that they
[50:44] confronted him that same demon that
[50:46] caused them to do that is sitting here
[50:48] today now I don't mean sitting here but
[50:50] it's in this it's in this religious
[50:52] realm
[50:53] today amen and they're gonna do the same
[50:56] thing if they if they kicked him out
[50:58] then they going to kick him out now if
[51:00] they killed him then they're going to
[51:01] kill him
[51:02] now listen the true message of the hour
[51:05] is the only
[51:07] way to get out of this conviction amen
[51:11] right that's right because remember
[51:14] there is a group that's not
[51:18] guilty we always worry about the guilty
[51:20] yes there is a guilty party but there's
[51:23] some that the judge is going to stand up
[51:24] and he said I don't see what they're
[51:26] doing
[51:28] all I hear is the word of God through
[51:30] their voice through the blood speaking
[51:32] to
[51:34] me oh what a happy time it should be
[51:36] folks amen and I'll promise you I'll
[51:39] read you a quote in a minute you've been
[51:40] heard it before but it's going to mean a
[51:42] lot more today I hope than it's ever
[51:43] meant to you before so he's going to S
[51:46] The Same Spirit that's on the people
[51:47] today brought the first crucifixion
[51:49] doing the same thing I must do that if
[51:53] it's going to be a crucifixion that
[51:56] they've crucified I must show to the
[51:58] people that the same attitude in the
[52:00] people today is doing the same thing
[52:03] spiritually they did in the physical
[52:05] then it could not have been done a few
[52:08] years ago I say 50 years ago could not
[52:11] have been done but today this is very
[52:13] timely and it could not have been done
[52:15] maybe 10 years ago he narrows it down
[52:18] more right but it can be done today
[52:21] because the time has run out in other
[52:22] words the seals are
[52:25] open the revelation of who that man of
[52:27] sin is and where he's sitting right cuz
[52:31] you and we'll read it when we get in the
[52:32] seal brother Brown said now I know now I
[52:35] know he thought he knew back then he
[52:38] said now I know why I hate that thing so
[52:40] much now I know why I've been so against
[52:42] these organization right and then what
[52:45] did they do they turned him out and he
[52:46] preached to 30 or 40 people in a trailer
[52:49] some of the greatest message you ever
[52:50] preached to you know a couple hundred
[52:54] people are you with me
[52:58] therefore the time for repentance for a
[53:00] nation is
[53:01] gone so God's not going to ever save a
[53:03] nation again the only nation he promised
[53:05] to save is Israel right he promised to
[53:08] preserve them and keep them and then
[53:11] take 144,000 out of them and then all
[53:14] hell's going to break loose you think
[53:16] it's bad in California now you just
[53:21] wait right if you sit
[53:25] down and look at the catastrophes the
[53:28] tsunamis even the earthquakes like that
[53:31] when it was overseas not long ago that
[53:33] killed thousands of people just you know
[53:35] things collapse talk about a 300 mile
[53:38] chunk of
[53:41] Earth how many miles wide it's 300 miles
[53:44] long I know but anyway that's
[53:47] bigger than
[53:49] Jamaica Jamaica's only 150 Mi across
[53:53] this way and 50 Mi this way it's like
[53:56] that whole chunk and that's where that
[53:59] 20% of the population of the United
[54:01] States is out
[54:05] there think about it think about what's
[54:08] going to happen when that thing goes
[54:11] under and you're going to feel it all
[54:12] the way out here get into Christ
[54:16] folks get into not trying to scare your
[54:18] kids anybody but you better get into
[54:20] Christ if you don't get into Christ
[54:21] you're going to be just like them people
[54:23] out there now that standing there
[54:24] looking at their house and it just
[54:25] completely
[54:27] disappears amen and when that thing
[54:29] slides off into the ocean folks I'm
[54:31] telling you there's going to be floods
[54:32] like you never seen there's going to be
[54:34] other earthquakes right amen there's
[54:37] going to be fires they can't contain EMS
[54:40] will not be able to get to certain
[54:41] people pipelines are going to bust
[54:44] internet things are going to that's
[54:46] Silicon Valley out
[54:48] there and water and electronics don't
[54:52] mix so when that thing slides off boom
[54:55] I'm just telling
[54:57] brother brandom's already give the
[54:59] conviction he already brought the
[55:01] evidence and he's already convicted
[55:05] them now we're waiting on the sentencing
[55:09] right so the conviction
[55:11] watch that's the only place he meets
[55:13] with man today is under the shed blood
[55:16] of the sacrifice I don't care if you're
[55:18] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian if you
[55:20] can forget your differences Roman
[55:22] catholic whatever you might be and will
[55:24] come under the shed blood God will will
[55:26] meet with both of us there right that's
[55:29] where we can meet all can all meet and
[55:32] fellowship on the same ground but
[55:35] otherwise he will not meet just because
[55:38] you're a Methodist he will not meet just
[55:40] because you're Pentecostal he'll not
[55:42] meet because you're a brand a brandom
[55:44] Believer or a message
[55:46] believer you got to be a word believer
[55:48] an end time word
[55:50] believer believer not unbeliever they
[55:53] turned into unbelievers now they don't
[55:55] believe what he said they don't believe
[55:56] it was a prophet they don't believe this
[55:58] they just turn into
[55:59] unbelievers that's where we can all meet
[56:02] but otherwise he will not meet you as a
[56:03] Methodist Pentecost
[56:06] Presbyterian he'll meet you under one
[56:08] condition that's under the shed blood
[56:10] now look he's bringing he's bringing it
[56:12] he's telling them the shed blood the
[56:14] shed blood you you can only get under
[56:16] the shed blood what now remember brother
[56:18] R said one time the bleeding word of God
[56:21] all right so we know the word of God In
[56:23] The Blood we know there's not blood
[56:24] running down on top of us
[56:27] we know there's not blood in the hands
[56:28] and oil and all that stuff brother R was
[56:30] talking about it's the bleeding word of
[56:32] God when you open that word of God and
[56:34] you read it that's what covers you is
[56:37] the shed blood of Jesus Christ by the
[56:39] word of God and you got to believe
[56:41] that's what'll take it away from you
[56:43] right that's where you become
[56:47] Believers I don't know if God can you're
[56:49] an
[56:51] unbeliever Jesus said I can do all
[56:53] things Paul said I can do all things
[56:57] Peter said I can do all
[56:59] things through Christ who what
[57:01] strengthens me
[57:03] amen now
[57:05] watch he'll meet you under one condition
[57:09] that's under the shed blood when your
[57:11] sins has been confessed and expelled in
[57:14] his presence then by the blood all right
[57:18] everybody with me so it's a bleeding
[57:20] word it's the word of God is what
[57:23] they've turned down so they've turned
[57:24] the blood down
[57:26] right come on they've turned the blood
[57:29] down they've turned the power that was
[57:32] behind the blood they turned that down
[57:35] everybody with me all right I'm building
[57:36] a case here and the blood is always
[57:40] before
[57:41] him the blood is always before him this
[57:45] is the only way he can judge you is by
[57:47] this right here amen and he judged his
[57:50] son at
[57:51] Calvary to take your place right if you
[57:54] get underneath that he you can't see
[57:56] your sin what happened is they couldn't
[57:59] they they took the blood and said no
[58:01] it's not the blood we know he died on
[58:04] the cross but I'm not going to get under
[58:06] that no I'll have to change
[58:09] my ways attitude dress hair where I go
[58:13] what I do what I think I'll have to
[58:15] change well praise God change me if you
[58:18] are if you're fine the way you are God
[58:21] help you

[58:29] with the way you are God help you the
[58:32] devil's already got
[58:34] you he'll meet you under one condition
[58:37] that's under the shed blood when your
[58:39] sins has been confessed and expelled in
[58:41] his presence then blow the blood now
[58:43] what is he telling them in this
[58:44] indictment he's saying there's a way to
[58:47] be not
[58:48] guilty everybody with me he's building
[58:51] the case for the unbeliever but he's
[58:54] trying to tell them look there's a way
[58:57] out there's a way to become a Believer
[59:00] there's a way to have what what is
[59:03] sin unbelief unbelief in what the
[59:07] doctrine of the word of God that's right
[59:10] this is where the unbelief is at they
[59:12] they don't believe this oh no they don't
[59:14] believe what I tell them well if you
[59:16] tell them the word of God what did God
[59:17] tell that Prophet one time he said they
[59:20] didn't reject you he said they reject me
[59:24] right they're rejecting me not you
[59:27] so now I'm building a case and I'm going
[59:29] to give you something here in just a
[59:30] second the blood is always before him
[59:34] therefore he can only see you through
[59:35] that shed blood and you're white as snow
[59:39] when you've confessed all your sins how
[59:43] many people believe
[59:44] that well for you
[59:47] unbelievers there's your way out listen
[59:50] there is a way out it's called
[59:52] Grace it's called Grace amen because the
[59:55] law will put put you in jail and the
[59:57] blood of an animal cannot cover you but
[1:00:01] when you take the blood of Jesus
[1:00:04] Christ let confess it it's all you got
[1:00:06] to
[1:00:07] do
[1:00:09] confess with an honest heart not say
[1:00:12] well if I did it I'm sorry no there
[1:00:14] ain't no if about it you did
[1:00:18] it and you're white as snow when you've
[1:00:20] confessed your sins otherwise look
[1:00:23] you're not there you cannot
[1:00:28] Fellowship that's right cuz remember
[1:00:30] God's not going to fellowship with
[1:00:32] unbelief that's why he's not
[1:00:34] fellowshipping with the
[1:00:36] denomination come on he's not
[1:00:38] fellowshipping with them today brother
[1:00:40] Brown listen I believe when a prophet
[1:00:42] says something that that that it changes
[1:00:44] the course of things when brother Ram
[1:00:47] stood that day and he described
[1:00:49] denominations as
[1:00:52] lodges nothing more than a place to meet
[1:00:54] like the Moose Lodge he said every
[1:00:56] church that's a denomination is a lodge
[1:01:00] I tell you what I am going to do
[1:01:02] preaching that Methodist Church March
[1:01:04] the 30th but I'll promise you they won't
[1:01:06] be no church order
[1:01:09] there why they've kicked God
[1:01:12] out amen there's no
[1:01:16] conviction right they have they have
[1:01:18] they have just totally seared their like
[1:01:21] that woman that said I I can see my um
[1:01:25] mother's soul in Hell fry and laugh at
[1:01:27] it why she had brother BR said she had
[1:01:29] seared everything away and there's no
[1:01:32] way God could get to her well there's no
[1:01:33] way God can get to an idea of a
[1:01:37] denomination they've got to come out of
[1:01:39] that they got to come out from under
[1:01:41] that and get out the blood right so
[1:01:44] where is the blood you say well brother
[1:01:46] it's the word amen hold
[1:01:49] on now watch that's the reason that you
[1:01:52] don't see things happening in the
[1:01:54] churches remember brother R said one
[1:01:56] unconfessed sin cause the whole church
[1:01:58] to fail one that's right amen yes sir
[1:02:03] Lord help me when you walk through that
[1:02:05] door be honest with yourself stop for a
[1:02:08] second and say God whatever I've done
[1:02:12] bring it to my attention and I'm going
[1:02:14] to pray I don't need people listen amen
[1:02:17] I don't need the pastor to lay hands on
[1:02:19] me not for that no no no that's between
[1:02:22] you and God right I can't pray a spirit
[1:02:25] off of you that you
[1:02:27] like no way if you like it you're going
[1:02:31] right back to it then brother Bown say I
[1:02:32] cast it out of her and they said well
[1:02:34] brother ra she went back same he said
[1:02:35] she loved that
[1:02:37] Spirit but she had a choice listen there
[1:02:40] was a new feeling when she came out from
[1:02:42] under
[1:02:43] that she just what she done was the
[1:02:46] unclean Spirit got thrown out and what
[1:02:48] happened was she didn't carry on with
[1:02:50] God and they came right back and she
[1:02:51] went back in the same place and got
[1:02:53] worse that's the same thing with us
[1:02:56] listen this is not
[1:02:57] playtime this is not a play pretty it's
[1:03:00] not something to take out and mold and
[1:03:02] put together and paint and make it no
[1:03:05] it's a life amen that's the reason you
[1:03:08] don't see things happening in the church
[1:03:10] they confess that they believe the blood
[1:03:14] but they reject the very plan to get to
[1:03:18] it right are you with can you read that
[1:03:22] they reject the very plan you know what
[1:03:25] plan they have a Baptist plan a
[1:03:28] Methodist plan you don't have to baptize
[1:03:30] we we
[1:03:31] sprinkle we we believe in a trinitarian
[1:03:34] Doctrine we believe there's eternal hell
[1:03:36] we believe we got to go through the
[1:03:40] Trib the very plan was what brother
[1:03:42] Brandon was bringing them the plan of
[1:03:44] God right and had brought them the plan
[1:03:46] of God all those years but they kept
[1:03:48] rejecting him they kept turning him
[1:03:51] down but they reject the very plan to
[1:03:54] get to the blood the
[1:03:57] word see there's only one way God will
[1:04:00] honor that word you'll never honor that
[1:04:04] word saying I'm a Catholic I demand this
[1:04:07] to be done you can't do it Methodist
[1:04:09] Baptist Pentecost you can't do it the
[1:04:12] only way you can do it is under the
[1:04:14] mercies of God through his grace amen is
[1:04:18] to come through the shed blood of Jesus
[1:04:20] Christ you're sitting here today under
[1:04:23] grace the grace of God brought you to to
[1:04:25] church the grace of God give you this
[1:04:28] message the grace of God let you hear
[1:04:30] this message now what are you going to
[1:04:31] do with
[1:04:32] [Applause]
[1:04:35] it look is to come through the shed
[1:04:38] blood of Jesus say Lord I claim the
[1:04:43] promise how many of us today Lord I
[1:04:46] claim your promise yes
[1:04:50] sir and you can put whatever you want to
[1:04:53] in there you can claim your family but
[1:04:55] you better claim yourself first right
[1:04:57] you better claim your salvation first
[1:05:01] cuz without your salvation there's
[1:05:02] nothing
[1:05:04] to there's nothing to give your
[1:05:07] kids there's nothing to give them if you
[1:05:09] ain't got it
[1:05:11] yourself you got to get it first this is
[1:05:13] a selfish
[1:05:15] religion to a degree you better get it
[1:05:18] yourself first but once you do it's the
[1:05:21] one thing you want to give away from
[1:05:23] then on cuz listen me and J was talking
[1:05:26] about coming up the road the other day
[1:05:28] we've got to
[1:05:29] realize that God when he gives eternal
[1:05:32] life it's like cutting a pie or breaking
[1:05:35] the bread and another piece Pops in its
[1:05:39] place you could give me a whole pie and
[1:05:43] if it come from God there'll be another
[1:05:44] pie there for somebody else don't
[1:05:48] think don't think God's going to get
[1:05:51] weak don't think you've asked too much
[1:05:53] from God I don't think we ask enough
[1:05:55] that's right of God Amen right now look
[1:05:59] God's not obligated to you though he's
[1:06:01] obligated to his word but you become the
[1:06:04] word then he's obligated to you because
[1:06:06] you plugged it in all right but first
[1:06:09] you've got to be under that blood all
[1:06:12] right everybody with
[1:06:14] me now watch who's going to carry out
[1:06:17] this indictment that there was a
[1:06:19] conviction and now there's an there's a
[1:06:22] sentencing 60 years later
[1:06:26] on Christ mystery of God revealed one of
[1:06:29] the greatest messages brother Brown ever
[1:06:30] preached he said if you miss in the
[1:06:31] seals come back to this message why
[1:06:33] because right
[1:06:35] here the church now remember it's the
[1:06:39] bride the church is the blood of
[1:06:42] Christ by the
[1:06:45] spirit right because the life is in the
[1:06:49] blood that's the baptism of the Holy
[1:06:52] Ghost that baptizes us into his body
[1:06:54] that recognize is only his body his
[1:06:57] flesh and his word brother Brown Pats
[1:07:00] the Bible denominations won't never
[1:07:03] touch that it's a revelation she knows
[1:07:07] it so did Eve know it but she
[1:07:10] fell but this look this one knows it
[1:07:14] this eve and won't fall she is ordained
[1:07:18] Hallelujah she's ordained to not
[1:07:21] fall she won't fall she's pre predes
[1:07:25] destinated to
[1:07:27] it so someone must carry out the
[1:07:32] sentencing if it's a blood that you got
[1:07:34] to be under and the bride is the blood
[1:07:37] by the spirit then we're the word
[1:07:41] am eternal life has to come from
[1:07:43] somebody that has eternal
[1:07:46] life the seed life comes to the body you
[1:07:49] got to hear a preacher that's born
[1:07:51] again all not
[1:07:56] okay but someone must carry out brother
[1:07:59] Ram stood and I indict you I convict you
[1:08:01] if you stay the way you are you're
[1:08:06] dead right but there's a group of people
[1:08:09] that claim the blood they took my sins
[1:08:13] away they took your sins away put them
[1:08:16] under the blood and put them in that sea
[1:08:18] that God created a place where he can't
[1:08:20] even go to amen right right God created
[1:08:23] a place that he can't even get in right
[1:08:27] oh now my God can do everything mine
[1:08:29] can't I'm glad mine can't right I'm glad
[1:08:32] my God can't remember my
[1:08:35] sins cuz it's put in the sea of God's
[1:08:37] forgetfulness never to be remembered
[1:08:39] again he will never remember we remember
[1:08:42] the devil remember your neighbor
[1:08:43] remembers your brother remembers your
[1:08:44] sister remember your wife remember your
[1:08:46] husband remember but you got to get over
[1:08:48] that your soul don't remember it I
[1:08:51] promise you if you're born again you got
[1:08:52] to listen to what your soul says just
[1:08:55] like I said in that first part listen to
[1:08:57] your soul your mind is your biggest
[1:09:00] problem hallelu amen
[1:09:03] right I don't know how I can do this
[1:09:05] listen if you've been in the message 10
[1:09:06] 15 years you ought to know by now right
[1:09:10] I'm sorry we got to quit being kids you
[1:09:12] got to know by now like brother we said
[1:09:14] read your Bible pray study the message
[1:09:16] study the message amen amen I'll just
[1:09:19] come Sunday and you just give us what we
[1:09:20] need brother way you just give us a a a
[1:09:23] heap and pile no I just want put my pile
[1:09:26] on the pile you already got that you
[1:09:28] should have got setting it home or
[1:09:31] listen or going down the road listening
[1:09:33] to tape or studying or whatever you
[1:09:36] don't have to be like brother brother
[1:09:38] Dell said that brother Tony one time
[1:09:39] said now you got to get right in front
[1:09:41] of the Jesus picture and you know a lot
[1:09:44] of people now are getting before the
[1:09:45] brother Brandon picture you ain't got to
[1:09:47] do
[1:09:48] that you're
[1:09:51] individual God will approach you if you
[1:09:54] let him
[1:09:56] the way you
[1:09:59] are the Lord cuz he talks to me
[1:10:02] different than he talks to you right
[1:10:04] some people may I don't know brother Bob
[1:10:06] and him they've never told me but they
[1:10:07] may study a week for a sermon I didn't
[1:10:09] get this sermon till last night now you
[1:10:11] sit there and you running around in your
[1:10:13] head and you think well I'm going to put
[1:10:15] this together and and I remember this
[1:10:17] quote right didn't brother Bown say I
[1:10:20] went down and I the angel would tell me
[1:10:22] something and I would go in the
[1:10:24] scriptures well see he didn't have a
[1:10:26] message he was bringing the message now
[1:10:28] we have the Bible and the message to
[1:10:30] bring back to our remembrance that
[1:10:33] brother Ram said somewhere in the in the
[1:10:35] message that the bride is the blood by
[1:10:37] the spirit and if there's a sentencing
[1:10:40] to be carried out
[1:10:43] listen are you ready the sentencing
[1:10:47] can't be carried out by the
[1:10:52] convict that would be real strange they
[1:10:55] wouldn't be nobody in
[1:10:57] jail but the conviction has to be
[1:11:00] carried come on people the conviction
[1:11:02] has to be carried out with somebody's
[1:11:04] got power enough to stand there and say
[1:11:06] you're wrong I'm
[1:11:09] right that's what a judge does now
[1:11:12] judges are corrupt as they can be we
[1:11:13] know that but I'm talking about the
[1:11:15] righteous judge and remember if you and
[1:11:17] I have that righteous judge inside of
[1:11:18] you how you going to judge the Earth
[1:11:21] it's going to be judged by what you do
[1:11:23] yes and the people people that you're
[1:11:27] around you're going to judge them
[1:11:29] they're going to be judged by how they
[1:11:30] treat
[1:11:31] you how they treat you oh no that now
[1:11:35] they remember brother Wade you said
[1:11:36] they've crucified Christ yeah there's a
[1:11:38] group and if you don't believe the word
[1:11:40] of God you do it to same thing but if
[1:11:42] you come in under the blood message of
[1:11:45] the hour the Bride of the end time right
[1:11:48] and you listen listen birth pains 1965
[1:11:51] these
[1:11:53] men if they pick up this preaching birth
[1:11:57] pains and goes out with it not stay at
[1:12:01] home and punch
[1:12:03] oh goes out with
[1:12:05] it Jesus said go in the all world and
[1:12:08] preach the gospel right
[1:12:10] go they can make more sense to it see to
[1:12:14] bring it to a place you would I just
[1:12:17] want to lay this seed then hope they
[1:12:20] make it come to life I believe a prophet
[1:12:24] he just gave us a commission as a
[1:12:26] five-fold Ministry to do that right
[1:12:28] there pick up this look that tea is
[1:12:31] thank God for some of them people in
[1:12:32] Jeffersonville that was smart enough to
[1:12:34] realize what this is right that's a
[1:12:37] capital T in the wrong
[1:12:39] place that not right what this this
[1:12:43] message pick up this message and go out
[1:12:46] with
[1:12:47] it amen and if we're the blood by the
[1:12:51] spirit
[1:12:53] listen God be blessed for seeing this
[1:12:55] wonderful Heavenly light in this last
[1:12:57] day praise God I say it myself because
[1:12:59] the church is doing the same thing today
[1:13:02] until the hour that organization
[1:13:04] religion is condemned and proved to be
[1:13:07] sacrificing Christ
[1:13:10] word okay
[1:13:12] condemned all right getting ready to be
[1:13:17] sentenced from then on comes the
[1:13:21] word and the word
[1:13:23] only now who's carrying it
[1:13:26] today five-fold Ministry in this
[1:13:29] message you can't carry it under a
[1:13:32] trinitarian Doctrine you can't carry it
[1:13:34] under a false Doctrine right yeah you
[1:13:36] can carry what he
[1:13:38] convicted but that's been dead that's
[1:13:40] dead that conviction is they're
[1:13:45] dead from the old Pascal lamb passed
[1:13:48] away and Christ became our lamb at the
[1:13:50] day of the crucifixion and the day that
[1:13:52] the denomination crucified the word of
[1:13:55] God and accepted a Creed in the stad of
[1:13:58] the word that's the day now watch I read
[1:14:02] this the other day did you really get
[1:14:03] this that's when the word became so weak
[1:14:07] and unpower and and there was I mean we
[1:14:09] just wowy wowy woo and we go over the
[1:14:11] corner and suck her
[1:14:12] thumb no he said that's the day the word
[1:14:15] comes into full
[1:14:18] effect this is what God wanted right he
[1:14:21] wants to show a group of people that'll
[1:14:23] stand up on the word of God he's going
[1:14:26] to show brother Bram said just for a
[1:14:28] moment God's going to show the bride to
[1:14:29] the earth I believe that under that
[1:14:31] third pole you're going to see some
[1:14:33] things you've never seen before but you
[1:14:35] better get in
[1:14:39] it cuz I just reading it the other
[1:14:41] day and I believe somebody brought it
[1:14:44] out oh brother Andrew over Brother David
[1:14:47] the third poll is to a group of people
[1:14:49] that can't be saved
[1:14:55] to the
[1:14:56] bride church for the church what to
[1:15:00] condemn them tell them they need to be
[1:15:01] bride and two the totally
[1:15:04] lost that cannot be
[1:15:07] saved then brother Brown continues on
[1:15:09] and he says they'll continue on and
[1:15:11] think they're getting
[1:15:13] saved they'll keep saying they're
[1:15:15] getting the Holy Ghost why because they
[1:15:17] didn't get the right way to begin
[1:15:19] with come
[1:15:21] on I believe the message I got a feeling
[1:15:23] I gotta put I gotta put I feel the
[1:15:28] pull what's it pulling you
[1:15:30] to that's my question what's it pulling
[1:15:33] you too there is a third pull it's for
[1:15:36] the bride it's pulling us out of
[1:15:38] here condemning the church and preaching
[1:15:42] to the totally
[1:15:44] lost today I indict this bunch of
[1:15:46] ordained
[1:15:48] ministers in their Creeds and
[1:15:50] denominations they are crucifying to the
[1:15:53] people they they the Ministerial
[1:15:56] Association are crucifying to the
[1:15:59] people with me the very God they claim
[1:16:03] they
[1:16:04] love and
[1:16:06] serve listen without the baptism of the
[1:16:09] Holy Ghost you can't serve God in agap
[1:16:11] love
[1:16:12] amen it's all filo it's all feelings
[1:16:14] it's all emotion it's all
[1:16:18] that right right CU remember a God love
[1:16:23] it don't have a condition just
[1:16:25] one trust
[1:16:28] me I indict these ministers in the name
[1:16:32] of the Lord Jesus upon their
[1:16:35] doctrine that claim that the days of
[1:16:37] Miracles is passed and that the water
[1:16:38] baptism in the name of Jesus is not
[1:16:40] sufficient and not right upon any of
[1:16:43] these words that they have substituted
[1:16:46] Creeds for I indict them now watch here
[1:16:49] it is as
[1:16:52] guilty all right they've been convicted
[1:16:54] right yeah right he brought he brought
[1:16:56] the indictment he brought the evidence
[1:16:58] now he brought right here the conviction
[1:17:02] I indict them as guilty and the blood of
[1:17:05] Jesus Christ upon their
[1:17:08] hands who is the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:17:10] today you and I that's why this world is
[1:17:13] the way they are it's because we're
[1:17:15] still
[1:17:18] herea cuz we're still here
[1:17:25] for crucifying a fresh the Lord Jesus
[1:17:27] the second time they are crucifying
[1:17:29] Christ to the public taking from them
[1:17:33] the thing that they're supposed to be
[1:17:35] giving to them and they substituted
[1:17:38] something else in its place a church
[1:17:40] Creed for popularity and today the
[1:17:42] church does the same thing it denies the
[1:17:45] word they don't want
[1:17:48] it they're
[1:17:50] preaching millions of people
[1:17:53] today around the world open this Bible
[1:17:56] right and preach the
[1:17:58] message I didn't say the message I said
[1:18:00] a
[1:18:03] message and it was
[1:18:05] dead the Letter's not dead I mean the
[1:18:07] letter the word's not dead when he takes
[1:18:11] that word and he looks at that and he
[1:18:12] sees and he says hey we must believe in
[1:18:14] the Blessed Holy Trinity and do all
[1:18:16] those things he has took the word of God
[1:18:18] and crucified it right amen cuz that's
[1:18:21] not under the shed blood that's why you
[1:18:24] and I
[1:18:25] listen I'll show you in a minute that's
[1:18:27] why you and I had to come out from under
[1:18:29] come out of her come out of those things
[1:18:32] that's right and come under the blood
[1:18:33] the bleeding word of God not a
[1:18:37] substitute now they're living under a
[1:18:39] substitute you and I are living under
[1:18:41] what the grace of God a human died for
[1:18:44] us well God died for us well a human
[1:18:45] body with human blood that had the life
[1:18:48] of God died for us okay now we believe
[1:18:52] and see that it's not just a literal
[1:18:54] function it's not just the blood
[1:18:56] chemistry brother Brown said but it's
[1:18:58] the life that was in the blood that's
[1:19:00] right and you and you and I are what the
[1:19:02] life of God on this Earth there is no
[1:19:05] other life of God on this earth except
[1:19:07] the Bride of Jesus Christ how many can
[1:19:09] say amen amen amen yes me and you you
[1:19:12] say wow now brother you're being too we
[1:19:14] ain't got close enough
[1:19:17] yet that is our
[1:19:19] problem will you really are we
[1:19:23] what become an unbeliever IT denies the
[1:19:26] word they don't want it it's contrary to
[1:19:28] what they've been taught to believe by
[1:19:31] their
[1:19:33] Creeds now watch I didn't bring this
[1:19:37] quote because I didn't find it quick
[1:19:39] enough and the word is the Messiah you
[1:19:44] believe that everybody with me now what
[1:19:46] did Brother Ram call
[1:19:48] us what did our prophet in the end time
[1:19:52] call us mid
[1:19:57] Messiah so the word is the Messiah and
[1:20:01] he had Messi you know there's we
[1:20:04] sometimes we take this over here and we
[1:20:05] say now well brother M told us that
[1:20:07] there was a harlot and she had daughters
[1:20:10] right
[1:20:11] churches well praise God we got a God
[1:20:14] over here that's
[1:20:16] real and he's got children right he's
[1:20:19] got churches that believe
[1:20:22] him the word is a Mah you believe
[1:20:27] that now
[1:20:28] watch well the reflection of the word
[1:20:31] then is what a reflecting of Messiah
[1:20:35] watch which is the Holy Ghost Among Us
[1:20:40] he is reflecting himself tries to
[1:20:42] wherever he can find a lamp that he can
[1:20:44] look through that ain't smoked up with
[1:20:46] Creeds and things he can give light
[1:20:49] through
[1:20:51] that now we've read this before but
[1:20:55] we're going to read it again and then
[1:20:56] we'll close here in just a
[1:20:59] second this is this quote to me brings
[1:21:04] everything relative to the whole message
[1:21:08] amen and what it was then and what it is
[1:21:13] now all
[1:21:15] right because remember the message of
[1:21:17] Malachi 4 is to do two things so they're
[1:21:19] two when he say when you say two things
[1:21:21] me and brother Josie are two things
[1:21:23] we're two humans we're not one we're two
[1:21:26] he is a human and I'm a human he has a
[1:21:28] name I have a
[1:21:29] name all right so there's two things
[1:21:32] that this messenger is going to do all
[1:21:34] right this is from the church age book
[1:21:37] now this messenger of Malachi 4 and
[1:21:38] Revelations 10:7 is going to do two
[1:21:40] things one according to Malachi
[1:21:43] 4 he will turn the hearts of the
[1:21:45] children to the fathers right Babylon
[1:21:49] Pentecostal babies that are baby
[1:21:52] Christians right B be
[1:21:55] Christians he's trying to get them to
[1:21:57] digest the word of God and eat and
[1:22:00] become
[1:22:01] adults right and become
[1:22:04] adults but what happened to the
[1:22:06] Pentecostals they stayed
[1:22:08] babies they didn't move on with
[1:22:11] God Pentecost had the word for the
[1:22:15] time remember the Holy Ghost fell on on
[1:22:17] on the day of Pentecost 1906 that was
[1:22:19] the Holy Ghost that wasn't AAL that was
[1:22:21] the Holy Ghost himself amen restoring
[1:22:24] the gifts well the gifts had to re be
[1:22:26] restored so that the Holy Ghost through
[1:22:28] brother brandham could bring us that
[1:22:30] Babylon bunch of babies us when we were
[1:22:32] first born again when we first brought
[1:22:35] into come into the message we're a bunch
[1:22:37] of
[1:22:38] babies but now we got to come to
[1:22:40] maturity the call today is maturity my
[1:22:43] dad's been preaching it we've all been
[1:22:44] preaching it is a growth development it
[1:22:46] is not a sit on your development that's
[1:22:52] right fill in the blank
[1:22:56] all right so he's doing that his message
[1:22:58] is turning the hearts of the people
[1:23:01] that'll
[1:23:03] listen yeah back now what was the faith
[1:23:05] of the fathers now watch what was the
[1:23:08] faith of the of the fathers I'll read it
[1:23:10] to you in just a minute it's in my list
[1:23:12] and I'll show you what they already
[1:23:14] believe brother R didn't bring this out
[1:23:16] of the Bible that nobody ever believed
[1:23:18] it but this
[1:23:20] time water baptism was taught back then
[1:23:26] right no eternal hell was taught back
[1:23:31] then one God was taught back then amen
[1:23:36] right that's why it has to have a number
[1:23:39] two
[1:23:40] part because number one
[1:23:43] part was the first part of his
[1:23:46] ministry and it's the baby stage taking
[1:23:49] you to
[1:23:50] maturity amen but then there's got to
[1:23:54] come number two that he will reveal the
[1:23:56] Mysteries that's why I told you we I
[1:23:59] read you that scripture the Mysteries
[1:24:02] the Deep things of
[1:24:04] God it's for me and
[1:24:06] youen listen a deep mystery is
[1:24:10] simple if you know what you're
[1:24:12] doing
[1:24:14] simple but you got to have the
[1:24:16] background you can't just come in the
[1:24:18] Mage church every 15 or 20 sermons
[1:24:24] oh praise the
[1:24:25] Lord I'm
[1:24:28] sorry it's a requirement that you go to
[1:24:30] school right amen amen it's a
[1:24:32] requirement that you go to
[1:24:35] school and read your book sometimes you
[1:24:38] give test God gives them I
[1:24:42] don't yeah praise the Lord out of my
[1:24:46] hands he's a lot more gracious I think
[1:24:50] now watch number two what's going to
[1:24:51] happen number one he's going to return
[1:24:53] us back back to the doctrine of the
[1:24:57] original
[1:24:59] Pentecostal bride in the first church
[1:25:01] age the alpha Church
[1:25:03] age all right everybody with me yes all
[1:25:07] right and
[1:25:09] then because Paul brought them to that
[1:25:12] Peter brought them to
[1:25:14] that they had that in the first three
[1:25:16] ages yep Paul irus Martin they weren't
[1:25:19] trinitarians they never baptized the
[1:25:21] name of Father Son and Holy Ghost but
[1:25:23] that was that was introduced right
[1:25:25] through Creeds and dogmas Through the
[1:25:27] Dark Ages and then even Luther comes out
[1:25:30] and he's got one piece of the messages
[1:25:31] right but all the others
[1:25:34] wrong come on Wesley comes in he's got
[1:25:37] that piece
[1:25:39] plus but the rest of us
[1:25:41] wrong Pentecost comes in they got that's
[1:25:43] piece of the message the rest of us
[1:25:47] wrong you say wrong brother you say
[1:25:49] listen any Doctrine outside the true
[1:25:51] word of God is
[1:25:52] wrong there ain't no great area it's
[1:25:54] either wrong or right yeah right so it
[1:25:57] took a prophet to what to Baby handle
[1:26:02] us baby handle us to come out of the
[1:26:05] denomination and put you in the message
[1:26:07] of the hour with the doctrine that was
[1:26:11] then everybody stay with me just for a
[1:26:13] second with the doctrine that was
[1:26:14] already preached in the
[1:26:17] Bible
[1:26:18] by
[1:26:20] Paul Peter James John irenius
[1:26:26] Martin but what did it do to them it put
[1:26:30] them in a
[1:26:33] grave it might have matured him to a
[1:26:35] place to
[1:26:38] hear but they got to have something come
[1:26:42] to get us out of
[1:26:43] here to fulfill the scripture that Paul
[1:26:46] said we which are alive and remain shall
[1:26:49] not prevent or hinder those which are
[1:26:52] asleep so number two number two takes
[1:26:55] you to Revelations 10 we'll get into
[1:26:57] this later on because we're going to
[1:26:58] start into the doctrines so one
[1:27:01] according to Malachi 4 he turn the
[1:27:02] hearts of the children of the fathers
[1:27:04] two he will reveal the mysteries of the
[1:27:07] seven thunders in Revelations 10 so
[1:27:10] don't tell me that all that's closed up
[1:27:12] don't tell me we can't get a
[1:27:14] revelation once that book's open the
[1:27:16] only person that can close is God Amen
[1:27:19] or you can close it
[1:27:22] yourself but God's going to close a book
[1:27:24] one
[1:27:25] day when that light called Gentile he
[1:27:27] going to shut that book there'll be no
[1:27:29] more
[1:27:32] called so he will reveal the mysteries
[1:27:35] of the seven thunders in Revelations 10
[1:27:38] which are the revelations contained in
[1:27:40] the Seven Seals so brothers and sisters
[1:27:42] the seals had to be
[1:27:44] open to reveal listen you can't reveal
[1:27:47] you can't read this Bible with something
[1:27:49] B binding it there it's in
[1:27:52] there brother John in there they 66
[1:27:55] books there's eternal life in
[1:27:58] here but if it shut
[1:28:01] up no
[1:28:03] good those seals were broke and when
[1:28:06] they were tore off that book come
[1:28:08] open amen and then I don't see Abraham I
[1:28:11] see
[1:28:12] me I don't see Isaiah I see me I was
[1:28:15] reading Isaiah today man read Isaiah
[1:28:19] Isaiah was a p and he was just a young
[1:28:20] man praise God you young Brothers God
[1:28:23] spoke through is he was just a young man
[1:28:25] that's right right but you know what
[1:28:28] happened to him they pulled him apart
[1:28:30] with mules and and um um oxen they
[1:28:35] pulled him apart whacked him apart
[1:28:37] whacked him up they hated him so bad
[1:28:39] that's all right if you give your life
[1:28:41] for the gospel you've not given your
[1:28:43] life for the devil right you've given
[1:28:46] your life for God Amen now
[1:28:48] watch it will be be these what divinely
[1:28:54] reveal mystery truths that literally
[1:28:57] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:28:59] Pentecostal fathers exactly so that's
[1:29:01] where we're at today but we're going to
[1:29:03] cover those doctrines a little bit later
[1:29:05] now
[1:29:06] watch in the church age book you'll
[1:29:09] recall that I mentioned at the beginning
[1:29:11] of this message that this book we are
[1:29:13] studying is the actual revelation of
[1:29:15] Jesus himself in the church and his work
[1:29:19] in the future age all right then I
[1:29:23] mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit
[1:29:25] to give us Revelation right or we will
[1:29:30] fail to get
[1:29:33] it bringing these two thoughts together
[1:29:36] you will re you will see that it won't
[1:29:39] take just ordinary
[1:29:42] study amen oh come to church let the
[1:29:44] brothers talk to you a little bit get
[1:29:46] excited like Louis did Wednesday night
[1:29:47] and everybody W that was good that was
[1:29:50] good but did you listen to what he said
[1:29:52] did you take something out of that
[1:29:54] message and put it in your heart
[1:29:58] amen now watch bringing these two
[1:30:00] thoughts together you will see that it
[1:30:02] won't take just ordin how many people
[1:30:03] believe brother Bron was a prophet how
[1:30:06] many believe he was a messenger that's
[1:30:07] telling us how to get to this place all
[1:30:11] right he's the
[1:30:14] guide we know Jesus Christ is the guide
[1:30:16] but we had to have brother brandom to
[1:30:18] tell us where to
[1:30:20] go right now look it's not just ordinary
[1:30:23] St
[1:30:24] and
[1:30:25] thinking to make this book real it's
[1:30:28] going to take the
[1:30:31] Operation God operate on me today yes
[1:30:34] sir take out all those things that I
[1:30:36] don't need usually when you have an
[1:30:39] operation they're taking something out
[1:30:40] of you that's either ruptured bad or you
[1:30:43] don't need it right amen I've never seen
[1:30:45] an operation where they
[1:30:49] put you say well what about a heart
[1:30:51] transplant they're transplanting they're
[1:30:53] taking something out putting it in his
[1:30:55] place but they don't open you up and say
[1:30:58] I think I'm going to include a a Time
[1:31:01] Clock I think I'm gonna put a I'm gonna
[1:31:03] put a wrench right here you
[1:31:05] know no usually when they operate on you
[1:31:08] they take stuff out of you it's going to
[1:31:10] take the operation of the Holy Ghost
[1:31:12] that means this
[1:31:14] book right here this
[1:31:18] book can't be revealed to anyone but a
[1:31:23] special class
[1:31:28] people it will take one with prophetic
[1:31:33] Insight not one person he's talking
[1:31:36] about a
[1:31:37] people it will require the ability to
[1:31:40] hear from God it will require
[1:31:44] Supernatural
[1:31:47] instructions not just a student
[1:31:49] comparing verse with verse look though
[1:31:52] that is good
[1:31:54] but a mystery now we're getting ready to
[1:31:57] talk about the Mysteries but the mystery
[1:31:59] requires the teaching of the spirit or
[1:32:02] it never becomes
[1:32:05] clear that's why I believe that teaching
[1:32:08] is that brother Brown said it places you
[1:32:10] in the body of Christ amen and placing
[1:32:13] you in the body of Christ gives you
[1:32:15] power to know who you are what you are
[1:32:20] and where you're supposed to
[1:32:22] be but mystery requires the teaching of
[1:32:25] the spirit or it never now what it never
[1:32:27] becomes
[1:32:28] clear how we need to hear from God and
[1:32:30] lay oursel open and become yielded to
[1:32:33] the spirit to hear and to
[1:32:37] know now brother Brown what are you
[1:32:39] talking about these Malachi 4 has got to
[1:32:41] do two
[1:32:43] things Rapture message 1965 when I went
[1:32:46] forth into the meetings with you praying
[1:32:48] for the sick it was
[1:32:51] fine but when I came with a message
[1:32:55] you know why he broke that off cuz he
[1:32:58] didn't want to say what he wanted to say
[1:33:00] cuz when I came with a message you
[1:33:01] rejected me cuz he's preaching this
[1:33:03] Rapture message in a trailer with about
[1:33:05] 30 people in
[1:33:07] it one of the greatest messages he ever
[1:33:10] preached if any message Goes Forth it's
[1:33:13] a true message if it's true genuine
[1:33:16] miracles of god and hangs right in that
[1:33:18] organization now watch if it's the true
[1:33:21] genuine miracles of god
[1:33:24] and hangs in that organization it's not
[1:33:27] of
[1:33:30] God CU that thing is already declared in
[1:33:33] other words that thing's already been
[1:33:35] convicted Jesus went forth and healed
[1:33:38] the sick in order to catch their eyes
[1:33:40] the people then he brought his message
[1:33:42] and what was his message I and my father
[1:33:46] are
[1:33:47] one now brother Bram said when the
[1:33:51] bride says I and my father one and these
[1:33:54] other things he said the shu's going to
[1:33:56] pull away cuz people can't stand it
[1:33:59] listen if you're not born again you're
[1:34:00] not going to be able to stand
[1:34:02] that it's going to get you right like it
[1:34:05] did the Pharisees it's going to burn
[1:34:06] right in their cross right in
[1:34:09] their soul right go brother Bri said
[1:34:12] their soul had no
[1:34:14] representation it was
[1:34:17] black only once any time then we close
[1:34:20] right here
[1:34:24] the in the days of the sounding of the
[1:34:25] seventh angel I remember Le Us in church
[1:34:29] AG the sounding of that angel when that
[1:34:32] church age is done denominated and
[1:34:34] become a church age when it's done in
[1:34:37] its Pentecostal organization when the
[1:34:39] messenger to that now watch what was
[1:34:43] each messenger what was Martin Luther a
[1:34:45] rebuke to the Catholic what' God say
[1:34:47] he's going to when he sends a message he
[1:34:50] rebukes the previous
[1:34:52] people right
[1:34:54] a plague
[1:34:55] Falls and he brings his message and
[1:34:58] condemns the
[1:34:59] people a rebuke to the lutherans Wesley
[1:35:03] what was the Pentecost a rebuke to the
[1:35:04] others where has the life gone now away
[1:35:09] from an organization no more shuck is
[1:35:12] the grain what is it a rebuke to the
[1:35:15] Pentecost SE to fulfill the scripture of
[1:35:17] this hour
[1:35:19] notice the very day when this messenger
[1:35:22] not when he start starts on not when he
[1:35:25] starts his healing campaign not when
[1:35:26] he's prayed for the sick not when he's
[1:35:28] in those denominations being nice and
[1:35:33] cordial but when he begins to declare
[1:35:36] his
[1:35:37] message in 1963 he began to declare his
[1:35:41] message right first pull healing second
[1:35:44] pull prophesying third pull opening of
[1:35:47] the word what look the Mysteries
[1:35:50] revealed no more there's no more higher
[1:35:52] order to De to reveal the the word than
[1:35:54] a prophet but the only way the prophet
[1:35:56] can be Vindicated is by the word now we
[1:35:57] know brother Brown was a Vindicated word
[1:35:59] Prophet we know that right and remember
[1:36:01] the third pole was the opening of them
[1:36:03] seals he tells you what it is the third
[1:36:05] pole is the opening of the seals right
[1:36:08] to reveal the hidden truth that's been
[1:36:10] sealed in the word listen not what Paul
[1:36:15] saw not what Peter
[1:36:18] saw no one knew who that son of man was
[1:36:22] but the son of man himself
[1:36:24] self sure they had their Doctrine they
[1:36:27] had the correct
[1:36:29] Doctrine to a
[1:36:31] point to a
[1:36:38] point there's two systems that work the
[1:36:41] word of God and denominational system I
[1:36:43] think that's pretty clear there's two
[1:36:45] there's twins in
[1:36:47] every every now look Esau and Jacob came
[1:36:49] out of the same
[1:36:51] womb righteous father righteous mother
[1:36:53] came out of the same womb one was on one
[1:36:56] side and one was on the other Esau was
[1:36:58] was the devil Jacob was type of
[1:37:02] Christ I hope that's simple enough for
[1:37:04] you to
[1:37:05] understand no other time this is the
[1:37:08] rapture message no other time could this
[1:37:10] message ever come forth till now Jesus
[1:37:13] said it was as the days of Sodom so
[1:37:14] shall be in the coming son of man the
[1:37:16] message could not be till now the world
[1:37:19] wasn't in the condition as until its in
[1:37:22] now my Heavens that was 196 4 the token
[1:37:26] message we're in
[1:37:31] 2025
[1:37:33] 60
[1:37:34] years heading to
[1:37:37] 61 no other time could this message ever
[1:37:40] come forth till now Jesus said as was
[1:37:42] the days of Sodom so shall be in the son
[1:37:44] of man coming of the son of man the
[1:37:46] message could not be till now the world
[1:37:48] wasn't in the condition as until it is
[1:37:50] now this is the hour that Jesus could
[1:37:52] appear at any
[1:37:55] time we know what Revelations 10:7 is
[1:37:58] he's going to restore the truth as he
[1:38:00] had it which is Malachi 4 and those
[1:38:02] elect with him in that day will be the
[1:38:04] ones who truly manifest the Lord and be
[1:38:07] his
[1:38:09] body and be his
[1:38:12] voice and perform his Works Hallelujah
[1:38:17] do you see
[1:38:18] it now let's read first let's go to
[1:38:21] Corinthians and then we'll close right
[1:38:22] here
[1:38:24] I read part of the scripture but I left
[1:38:25] off some of it
[1:38:27] off but that is it written I have not
[1:38:30] seen or ear heard neither have entered
[1:38:31] into the heart of man have you ever
[1:38:33] realize that we take this Bible and we
[1:38:35] read this Bible it it was written by men
[1:38:37] right we know the Holy Ghost wrote it
[1:38:39] but it had to come through Moses Isaiah
[1:38:43] Amos Ezekiel people human beings Paul
[1:38:47] arenus or or Paul I'm sorry Paul Peter
[1:38:51] James John
[1:38:54] they wrote this book by the inspiration
[1:38:56] of the Holy
[1:38:59] Ghost but they were looking for
[1:39:05] you they were looking for
[1:39:08] you they were looking at a time when
[1:39:10] what they said would be made
[1:39:13] manifest Isaiah never saw a virgin
[1:39:16] conceived
[1:39:19] true Malachi never saw John come on the
[1:39:22] scene John
[1:39:23] John the Baptist he never saw Brother
[1:39:26] randam come on the scene yet he
[1:39:27] prophesied about he probably didn't know
[1:39:29] that man was brother randam he said
[1:39:30] there'd be a Spirit come behold I send
[1:39:32] you Elijah the
[1:39:33] prophet everybody with me Paul didn't
[1:39:37] see his word made all the way
[1:39:39] manifest Peter didn't see
[1:39:42] it brother bradam didn't see
[1:39:46] it he saw the word but he didn't see
[1:39:50] you he knew they'd be a people
[1:39:54] and we just throw it off on the Wayside
[1:39:56] and whatever you can't do that man you
[1:39:59] got to get in it get in it or get out
[1:40:01] one of the
[1:40:02] two but that as it is written I have not
[1:40:06] seen nor ear heard neither have entered
[1:40:07] into the heart of man the soul of man
[1:40:10] the things which God hath prepared for
[1:40:12] them that love

[1:42:02] it for me it took me a minute to find a
[1:42:04] quote that says the church is the blood
[1:42:05] by the spirit CU I was putting in the
[1:42:08] bride was the blood by the spirit it
[1:42:10] ain't in there how many times I know

[1:42:16] exact word that's why I want somebody to
[1:42:17] teach us how to use that folio
[1:42:21] views cuz if you don't put these that
[1:42:23] word in you can forget it you know what
[1:42:25] when you when I start just for a minute
[1:42:27] when I start typing in a word I'll put
[1:42:29] the exclamation point over here you know
[1:42:31] and and that puts the words together
[1:42:34] exactly and you start putting them in
[1:42:37] Blood by the and you still keep it's
[1:42:40] going down to you know like 20 something
[1:42:42] there's 20 something places that happen
[1:42:44] and then you put in spirit and it goes
[1:42:48] zero so you got to start all over again
[1:42:51] right brother you got to start all over
[1:42:52] again
[1:42:53] put something in there that you might
[1:42:55] think happened during that time so I

[1:43:00] Church blood Body Spirit found it but I
[1:43:05] was about 25 other quoes I had to go
[1:43:06] through before I found that

[1:44:11] God I didn't want to talk I don't want
[1:44:13] to talk to your
[1:44:17] daddy you talking about a bulldog of all
[1:44:20] Bulldog his daddy was a bulldog and if

[1:44:44] I do I about out the door gone why cuz I
[1:44:47] had a spirit of man in me I have a
[1:44:49] spirit of God in Me Now I don't I'm not
[1:44:51] fearful to stand up in front of
[1:44:57] anybody oh man I listen you ought to be
[1:45:01] able to converse with brother brandom if
[1:45:02] he was still here let's don't be
[1:45:05] shameful if you got the spirit of God in
[1:45:07] you then guess what it knows now watch
[1:45:10] even so the things of God knoweth no man
[1:45:12] but the spirit of God now we have
[1:45:13] received not the spirit of the world but
[1:45:15] the spirit which is of god that we might
[1:45:18] know the things that are freely given to
[1:45:20] us of God now listen don't cost to Dime
[1:45:23] now here's let's finish this which
[1:45:25] things also we
[1:45:27] speak we speak we
[1:45:30] speak not in The Words which man's
[1:45:33] Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost
[1:45:36] teacheth comparing spiritual things with
[1:45:40] spiritual remember we're a spiritual
[1:45:42] group of people we're a prophetic group
[1:45:43] of people but the natural man receiveth
[1:45:47] not the things of the spirit of God for
[1:45:49] they are foolishness unto him neither
[1:45:52] can he know them because they are
[1:45:54] spiritually discerned but he that is
[1:45:57] spiritual judges all things yet he
[1:46:02] himself is
[1:46:04] judged of no
[1:46:06] man
[1:46:08] wow oh don't be Jud listen sisters I'm
[1:46:11] telling you you walking in Walmart with
[1:46:14] your hair and your dress and being uh
[1:46:18] holy you're judging every person that
[1:46:21] walks by you
[1:46:23] I believe that with all my heart and if
[1:46:27] you men can stand in a group of people
[1:46:28] that's drinking and cussing and smoking
[1:46:30] and and you can stand there and try to
[1:46:32] witness to them a little bit or they say
[1:46:34] man what here have a beer I don't
[1:46:36] drink why don't you do this any I don't
[1:46:38] do that no
[1:46:40] more you're judging them yes and most of
[1:46:44] the time like I was most of the time
[1:46:47] they want to go out the door they don't
[1:46:49] want to fellowship with you no more no
[1:46:51] right because they have the spirit of
[1:46:52] man but we have the spirit of God but he
[1:46:54] that is spiritual judges all things yet
[1:46:57] he himself is judged of no man cuz
[1:47:00] remember we've got to realize we are
[1:47:02] judged because God judged
[1:47:07] Christ same person but God was in human
[1:47:10] flesh called Jesus but we took he took
[1:47:13] our judgment we were judged by
[1:47:17] him he was judged of the father to be
[1:47:21] completely sinless right but he took on
[1:47:23] sin for us so that we can what we can
[1:47:25] have no spot no
[1:47:27] wrinkle no
[1:47:29] sin for who hath known the mind of the
[1:47:32] Lord that he may instruct him question
[1:47:34] mark but we have the mind of
[1:47:38] Christ magicians get ready to
[1:47:40] come let me read this real quick if
[1:47:43] Revelation is beyond you now watch if
[1:47:46] you're sitting here today going I don't
[1:47:48] know what these thing you're talking
[1:47:49] about seals and you're talking about
[1:47:50] this if the revelation is beyond you
[1:47:54] look up and seek God for
[1:47:58] it problem is like brother Lise said we
[1:48:00] shut down and quit going to
[1:48:02] church that's a wor that's what devil
[1:48:04] wants you to
[1:48:05] do if Revelation is beyond you come on
[1:48:09] musicians if Revelation is beyond you
[1:48:12] look up and seek God for it that is the
[1:48:17] only way you're ever going to get
[1:48:21] it it Never Comes by human natural
[1:48:25] endowments but by spiritual enduement
[1:48:29] endued with power from on
[1:48:32] high you can even memorize the scripture
[1:48:36] and though that is wonderful that won't
[1:48:38] do it it has to be a revelation from God
[1:48:42] it says in the word that no man can say
[1:48:43] that Jesus is the Christ except by the
[1:48:45] Holy Ghost you have to receive the Holy
[1:48:48] Ghost and then and only then can the
[1:48:49] spirit give you the Revelation that
[1:48:51] Jesus is the Christ go God the anointed
[1:48:55] one no man knows the things of God save
[1:48:57] the spirit of God he's quoting the
[1:48:59] scripture I just read you and he to whom
[1:49:01] the spirit of God reveals them we need
[1:49:03] to call on God for Revelation more than
[1:49:06] anything else in the
[1:49:11] world we have accepted the Bible now
[1:49:14] watch we have accepted the great truth
[1:49:17] of it you reading that but it still is
[1:49:21] not real to most people because the
[1:49:23] Revelation by the spirit is not
[1:49:28] there now let me read these this is a
[1:49:30] list of the
[1:49:32] things
[1:49:33] now one God brother brandham always
[1:49:37] believed in one God he never believed in
[1:49:40] a trinity that's why he had to come out
[1:49:41] of the Baptist Church right water
[1:49:44] baptism he didn't believe it to what
[1:49:46] they believe he had to come out of it
[1:49:48] right no eternal hell same thing he
[1:49:52] preached Holiness conduct and dress he
[1:49:54] preached Church order he put the church
[1:49:57] back in order as Elijah did on Mount
[1:49:59] Carmel when the 400 Ministers of the day
[1:50:02] tore the altar down he put them all back
[1:50:05] put the altar right back together
[1:50:06] because the M the mystery in the end
[1:50:09] time is is that Elijah Ministry is a
[1:50:11] restoring Ministry it restored back all
[1:50:13] right it was restoration then what did
[1:50:15] he do he restored back that poor old
[1:50:17] widow woman was about to die He restored
[1:50:20] her back to life every by with me he
[1:50:23] preached Church order he brought the
[1:50:26] truth of serpent
[1:50:27] seed he brought the truth of body change
[1:50:30] for Abraham and Sarah have you ever
[1:50:31] heard that before you tell that to a
[1:50:34] denominational person they'll look at
[1:50:36] you
[1:50:37] crosseyed but it's plain once the
[1:50:40] Bible's open it's plain to see those
[1:50:42] things brother Brown brought us the
[1:50:44] difference in the body Spirit and the
[1:50:46] Soul he brought us no tribulation for
[1:50:49] the bride no white Throne judgment for
[1:50:51] the bride right he brought us to church
[1:50:54] ages put the messengers in line and the
[1:50:57] message he brought the statue of a
[1:50:59] perfect man unto
[1:51:02] adoption he brought the 70 weeks of
[1:51:04] Daniel and put them in order he brought
[1:51:07] the seal slash the
[1:51:08] Thunders you can't bring one without
[1:51:10] bringing the other The Mystery of the
[1:51:13] son of man now there's one that nobody
[1:51:16] understands in the end time except the
[1:51:19] bride she will understand this is the
[1:51:21] ministry of the son of man all right now
[1:51:24] number U well I don't have them numbered
[1:51:26] the next one is the grace given on
[1:51:28] marriage and divorce let me give you a
[1:51:29] little key on this brother brandham
[1:51:32] didn't preach marriage and divorce to
[1:51:33] tell us
[1:51:36] how a different way to get married and
[1:51:41] to
[1:51:43] divorce it was already in the
[1:51:46] Bible it was already in the Bible the
[1:51:48] right way to do it am I am I right
[1:51:50] ministers it was in the Bible already
[1:51:53] there man had just what misinterpreted
[1:51:57] theology had let it go so long till it
[1:52:01] became so eroded it wasn't Grace it was
[1:52:03] greasy
[1:52:04] Grace but brother randam brought the
[1:52:07] grace given on marriage and divorce
[1:52:10] right he brought the three
[1:52:12] PS Rapture how it was going to happen
[1:52:15] who it was going to happened to wasn't
[1:52:17] to the
[1:52:19] church only to the bride amen amen and
[1:52:23] told us exactly what the future home was
[1:52:26] going to look
[1:52:28] like and if I miss something then we'll
[1:52:30] look over it a little bit later but
[1:52:31] that's the things that we're going to
[1:52:32] bring out in the form that we of the
[1:52:35] opening of The Mysteries of God because
[1:52:37] they were Mysteries what happened was
[1:52:39] all these first few ones right here in
[1:52:40] the front they already taught it Paul
[1:52:44] when brother Ry preached Church order it
[1:52:46] come from what Paul
[1:52:48] said right he didn't bring something
[1:52:51] extra he just put it all back
[1:52:53] together he didn't say now the Bible's
[1:52:55] wrong they were wrong in that in that
[1:52:57] age there isn't there was not an eternal
[1:52:59] hell they preached it was no man
[1:53:01] preached there
[1:53:02] was man preached water baptism in the
[1:53:05] name of father son Holy Ghost they never
[1:53:08] did they never believed in one God ever
[1:53:12] till n seea then they broke him up into
[1:53:14] three made a trinity out of
[1:53:18] him and I believe they knew about
[1:53:20] serpent seed they knew what happened in
[1:53:21] the garden
[1:53:25] right but they didn't know about the
[1:53:27] body change from Abraham and
[1:53:29] Sarah Paul said I I pray that your whole
[1:53:32] body spirit and soul be preserved
[1:53:34] blameless but he didn't tell us what he
[1:53:36] he told us kind of what the body was
[1:53:37] spirit and soul what happened yeah but
[1:53:39] brother Brandon put them everyone just
[1:53:41] as clear as it could
[1:53:43] be no tribulation for the bride I'm
[1:53:45] telling you do something go to somebody
[1:53:47] that's a that's a a Baptist or a
[1:53:50] Methodist or a Pentecostal or a
[1:53:51] presbyterian and say do you believe we
[1:53:52] need to go we're going through the
[1:53:53] tribulation you know what they're going
[1:53:54] to say oh yeah we ain't none of us worth
[1:53:57] nothing we got to go through the Bible
[1:53:59] the Bible says we got to go through the
[1:54:00] tribulation my Bible doesn't say
[1:54:03] that does your B if your Bible says that
[1:54:06] you're in trouble my Bible doesn't say
[1:54:09] that my Bible say I've passed from death
[1:54:11] into life I've already took my
[1:54:13] tribulation Christ took my tribulation
[1:54:16] oh we may have little tribulations here
[1:54:18] but listen it's not going to be compared
[1:54:20] to the tribulation if you missed it that
[1:54:22] you going to have that thing out there
[1:54:24] in
[1:54:25] California a
[1:54:28] pimple to what it's going to
[1:54:30] be let's stand to her feet it's going to
[1:54:33] be Nationwide the United States is not
[1:54:35] going to be able to recover to what's
[1:54:37] going to happen to
[1:54:39] her never will recover from
[1:54:44] it if time goes on guess what they'll go
[1:54:47] out there in California right brother
[1:54:49] Joe they and time goes on they'll go out
[1:54:51] there they'll clear it off they'll build
[1:54:53] in brand new houses again they'll put
[1:54:55] their Shrubbery out they'll put this out
[1:54:57] and they put that out and some man with
[1:54:58] a cigarette will throw it out the window
[1:55:00] and they'll burn it
[1:55:01] again but when God Burns this place it's
[1:55:04] going to
[1:55:05] burn just be ready to go no white Throne
[1:55:09] judgment we've already been judged I
[1:55:10] love that you know that's my two
[1:55:11] greatest
[1:55:13] ones but we're going to go through some
[1:55:14] of these we've already been through the
[1:55:15] church ages but we're going to pick some
[1:55:16] of these out and
[1:55:18] show that it was a mystery to many
[1:55:23] people until that little
[1:55:25] Prophet comes out and preaches serpent
[1:55:28] seed lays it right out in the Bible
[1:55:31] tells us exactly what happened and then
[1:55:33] when you look at it if you got the Holy
[1:55:35] Ghost even without the Holy
[1:55:37] Ghost okay I didn't have the Holy Ghost
[1:55:40] when I was 14 years
[1:55:42] old but I knew what happened in the
[1:55:44] garden cuz brother Ram explained it so
