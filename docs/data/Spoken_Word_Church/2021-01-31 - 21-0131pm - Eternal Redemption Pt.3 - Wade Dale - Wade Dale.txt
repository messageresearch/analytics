behind it and have a pastor that that uh that believes and we need to get together as couples and then for also for the and pay for it and also for the uh i hope we can start getting the youth back together and like brother dale said we at least i'd like to get the sunday school back for the little kids because they need it and the little kids are a little less susceptible than we are for this um whatever you want to call it virus so we just be diligent everybody remember do what we say wear masks and then fellowship downstairs with the whole i think we're i think we're all pretty much 99 100 of us are doing it so um we appreciate that now i want to today we're speaking on eternal redemption and i've been thinking this week i've got several things laid out here and some more quotes over there and i added one so you know how that goes but before we get into our chart that most of you have and we'll put we'll bring it up here um we need to cover something because listen we know as well as anybody in the world that the bible is like an onion peel it's real thin layers and you can just keep pulling the layers back because it's eternal right and then we have a prophet of god that came to make that more plain amen make that more plain not confusing make that more plain and he was a what a bible prophet this is going to be real important in a few minutes because i if you don't say yeah then you're going to be in trouble he was a word prophet he could say nothing outside of what the word said he didn't bring his own bible he didn't make his own revelation but i'll tell you what though you got to remember the prophet of god tells us and that's the way i read my bible as a love letter you've heard me many times tell you that if you don't get the essence of this message and the essence of this bible you're going to miss it because if i've got quotes sitting right in there that eternal life came at the altar i've got quotes right here that eternal life was before the foundation of the world brother brown's not that confused we are the ones that are confused he's not he was showing us something but you're going to have to onion peel this thing and see when he's talking about the mind of god and what he's talking about down here because verily verily i say unto you this ain't the this ain't the perfect will of god this is the permissive will of god working into the perfect will of god everybody got that say amen because listen close your eyes just for a second everybody close their eyes you got 30 seconds to think about your life from a baby to right now and when you open your eyes i want you to raise your hand if you've never had a bad thought never say anything bad about somebody never done something wrong you can go and bring open your eyes now because you better not put your hand up because that makes you a liar brother chris has got his hand down this way he said he was down there so now did anybody come here perfect no by the transforming power of god we become perfect but not in this that's right but remember the mind of god can't change everybody got that mind of god can't change he can't say well you know i thought of samuel dale but now when he got down here he started just being a rascal a dog and i ain't gonna have nothing to do with no what have we been reading about this is before the foundation of the world right this thing was done settled signed and delivered the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world so why does the prophet say that your eternal life began at the altar i got the quote right here life begins at the altar eternal life when you come to jesus christ then i got one right here from the smyrna church age that says you did not become seed by the rebirth you were seed and therefore were reborn there's your difference you were reborn there has to be an action amen or jesus could have looked in nicodemus and said nicodemus you always was eternal you just one of us no he wasn't he wasn't in the eternal mind of god because he never became a seed of god now he'll be given eternal life that's not seed of god and remember when i talk about seed today i'm going to write it right up here in the corner what is seed seed's not what you're planting the ground talking about god seed is the word god has no natural germ sperm no seed as far as we see because i know when some of you when somebody preaches on seed that's the first thing you think about it's planting something god didn't have to plant one thing in the garden of eden it was there because of what spoken word of god i like what brother chris said he said you know the first action wasn't the creation god said god said the first thing was the spoken word and then the creation happened so in genesis 1 26 when he said let us make man in our own image there we were but it wasn't every seed that come on the face of the earth it was only the seed of god the word of god we were in him before the foundation of the world but the problem is like we're going to look on our timeline something happened and pushed us down here into time but it's working us because redemption means what to bring back or purchase back we'll read that in just a second so put those things in your mind and come to me and tell me you were born right and i'll tell you you're a liar according to the bible nothing good nothing you were born wrong you come to this world lying stealing contrary to god but now that didn't change the mind didn't change that none what bit didn't change the mind of god one bit you always were there if you were there you'll always be there he can't add you to it but he can't take you away from it either amen so hebrews 9 verse 11 because we're going to have to cover that because when we read the prophet's message and we see these things that people say seems to be contrary or or you know somebody will just bring you a quote and go here no bring me the whole picture i can pick this message apart with one quote at a time this bible today is being picked apart one verse at a time by contrary preaching out there and even here if you say so hebrews 9 11 says but christ being coming high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle from brother dale's talk about this morning not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of bulls and goats or calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us let's bow our heads just for a moment lord you know we've been thinking about this for days running it over in our mind and seems like this is the way to go lord that we were looking at last night and i pray lord that you would just anoint our lips you do the speaking i know for a fact the prophet of god stood here and brought us the perfect word of god yet people turned him down so you're the only one that can do the revealing you're the only one that can go way down into that soul of that individual and change us lord and make us right and lord for us to be in this end time you require that we come to adoption that we come to full headship so you've made a way lord you promised you'd do it you said you'd do it and you said through the foolishness of preaching this is the way it's going to be and lord i pray that you would bless us keep us take care of us be with the ones that are sick lord the ones that are on the highways brother bob and him on the way back lord there from sweetwater and brother lewis and them down in atlanta lord we pray that you'd bring them back together together in one father in jesus name we ask these things amen obtain you can be seated having obtained eternal redemption for us so see he had to obtain something he didn't come here eternal in his body hello he didn't come here eternally in his body right but yet he came eternal from the god from god he was god no less god no more god right but you and i didn't come the way he came we can't be the fullness that one as one person but as a collective body we can be one amen the fullness of the godhead bodily and then in the end time the bride must be the fullness so now let's look at the greek lexicon and see what it says about redemption we've been talking about eternal redemption and i didn't bring this last week but look redemption means what deliverance a releasing affected by payment because remember it had there had to be a payment boaz had to stand up and take his shoe off and say i will because there's no way naomi could do that right she was caught she was trapped amen right somebody had to stand forth a kinsman had to redeem and what did he what did he say he didn't say i'll take all the roofs or know amy stuff and i'm going to keep it for myself no he redeemed it for her he gave it to her so christ came remember i told you before this brings out the outstanding quote where the prophet god said jesus didn't come to bring you your inheritance he came to bring you to your inheritance so there's the redemption that's why eternal redemption that's why brother brown tells us is one of the oldest things in the book of the bible redemption was before the foundation of the world it's not just something that just developed but you know thank god for a prophet though that could see i don't think any other prophet maybe paul was close but i was thinking about this the other day there's no other prophet of god that could take the mind of god and bring it so vivid that we can understand it because it's way back here way back in eternity way back there no way you can understand this guy we understood who jesus was kinda second person of the trinity whatever whatever you understand what i mean before we came to the message but it took a profit to take us back here and tell us where we came from what we're doing here and where we're going most everybody else talk about denominations and everyone they tell you where we're going but they don't have a real good idea about where we're going we got to go through tribulation we got to go to this we got to go to we got to go to purgatory we got to go this place we got to go that you see what i mean prophet god said nope no such thing as purgatory hell is not burning at the moment it's the fifth dimension it's where you go we understand that we're going to look at the dimensions maybe in a couple of sundays but remember brother brown gives us a real good definition of redemption he says to bring it back or to bring back right all right you had to put something you got in trouble you had to put something in the pawn shop but now remember you got to have something to purchase it to get it back you can't just go back and say hey i want my stuff back no you got to pay a price right jesus christ but see remember we couldn't pay the price once we got in the pawn shop we couldn't pay the price see even when him adam sold us out he got put in the pawn shop but adam couldn't bring himself back out he wasn't a savior he wasn't the redeemer he was a son of god but he wasn't a redeemer so any action he did kept him in the pawnshop and literally let me tell you something literally though from adam to jesus christ everybody stayed in the pawnshop that right right there was no redemption there was no eternal life given in the soul of man in the old testament right it stayed up there because remember we're going to look in our timeline and i'm going to use should i use blue for eternal or red for eternal you choose you said blue first don't be swayed by all them people back under i asked you i asked you and they answered i throws blue myself too thank you whoever said red you're wrong okay all right this is eternal or eternity our god or the mind of god all right everybody got that uh all right and here's the eternal line and you're gonna see it on your chart in a minute if you want to look at it you can that's okay but now remember down here is i'm going to just put us got it eternal in us everybody got that saying man this cannot ever change this will this will change because it's not eternal it's in time eternal will never change always was always will be and this is right here i'm going to put this just for anywhere you see that right there you see everybody got that there we see that dot that's god everybody okay with that and then this is us every time i make a little red dot everybody got that because i want to tell you something if you think you came here with something that somebody else didn't have then god is not a respecter of persons and he cannot judge the person that he didn't put here on earth with whatever you think you got when you got here on earth that's why i asked you when you closed your eyes i asked you you never made a mistake you never done anything wrong baloney so we change we change our mind he can't everybody got that we can change our mind he cannot so here we go through here let's look number one so remember redemption is to bring back look if we were right here if we were in him if we were thought of him a thought of god before the foundation of the world which we were if we have eternal life then whatever the fall caused it brought it down through to here everybody got that cause that's what the fall means it was up here at one time can you pick that up for me it was up here at one time though and it went down here but now god didn't come and redeem this he redeemed what fell everybody got that redemption is not replacement amen he didn't replace listen that's what you got look at what brother brown was talking about he did not replace anything he didn't say well no i think i'll just wipe that off and i'll start back over here no that's where he started that was his thought his thought was eternal it never can change never will change but as we were talking before we'll get into it later he had attributes that couldn't be displayed if we stayed right here everybody got that because us is sick us is falling falling us is born in sin shaping in the nick we come to the world speaking lies us have wrong ideas us came wrong to start with he didn't but whatever if we started right here bro chris once we got to get back to that spot we gotta get right here back to this spot we're down here now we're in lifetime and matter we'll get into those dimensions later on but i got to bring this out because that may be a question in your mind and i know that ninety percent of the people in this message believe that we came here with this eternal something in us uh you know what you say well i got quotes well i just quoted you two quotes that looked like they were totally opposite brother brown said you always was eternal he said right here in 1960 that's your eternal life began at the altar you say oh i always was a wheat germ no no we fixing to read eight quotes where brother brown said you were a cuckleberg and by the transforming power of god he changed you into a wheat right now see i like to think that i don't like to think that i always was eternal because if i was doing them things and i hate eternal life in me no forget it folks be sensible be sensible when i was out there laying it in sin sure god was right here he never moved he never blacked me out oh hallelujah but he knew i'd come back to that but i wasn't there to begin with right here i'm talking about right here i was in eternity but see it took a profit to tell us what the mind of god was talking about not what we're talking about because right here this was born in sin shaped an iniquity a spouse from a mother's womb a liar brother brown said he was lost that's what he said i was lost he said i used to if you ever see you don't read all the quotes you read the ones you want to read brother brown said i washed my car and watched people go to church on sunday a prophet no let me tell you something why didn't paul this is in my notes i'm going to get to it right now why didn't paul just when he was hey listen what was he doing he was causing real true believers to blaspheme putting them in prison and killing them now how can something be eternal inside of paul and let him do what he did no way why did he go to damascus and god had to knock him off of the horse and he didn't look down and say now paul you always was eternal now no he said paul you're blind and i'm gonna take you what are you doing what'd you do that for leave it right there i'll get it later no he said paul you're blind you're persecuting me and if me was in paul why was he doing it no but he had representation he knew god knew when he knocked paul off the horse he would change but not right then bible says he went three days blind as a bat and he said i'm going to have to have somebody come pray for you that's got to see life inside of them now why did he not do why why didn't he just say paul now you always was eternal why in the world don't you just get up and go start preaching the gospel that ain't the way god works folks right right amen right i don't understand this when people say god's brother brother said we always were eternal yeah eternal life always was but i wasn't where are you going to put justification in this where are you going to put sanctification where the unclean spirit goes out of you where out of your soul so you and god can't be a well you satan and god can't be in your soul see you're almost too soul that stupid doctrine they said that satan put a soul inside of you and god put a soul inside him satan can't give you a soul he ain't a soul maker god is a soul maker and a soul destroyer satan can't even destroy your soul what the bible say don't fear the one that can kill the body you fear the one that can kill the soul so we've got to keep it separate if we don't keep it separate i just i don't understand how that we can kick redemption totally out of the picture right because the bible says the unclean spirit goes out of a man walks to dry places seek his rest find us none now did you have an eternal something inside your soul at that time no because the bible says i'm talking bible you say i got clothes if the quote don't match the bible he's wrong but he don't you see how these other people have all these doctrines because they take quotes and they don't put it with the bible and put the essence together brother brown says let's address stand up and address the third person of the trinity well now he wasn't a trinitarian prophet if we don't get these right folks people we're going by the grave if we don't get it right you can have your idea for as long as you want to but your idea we're going to put you in the ground and say we'll see you in the i didn't want to say that see any resurrection anyway redemption is to bring back number one redemption is the oldest thing in the bible so what is redemption redemption is not just realizing you were realized it's bringing you back right i realized i was lost redemption's one of the oldest things in the bible do you know redemption was ever before the plan of redemption look look at me was laid out before the foundation of the world that's right and if bob black was here he'd tell you what that little dot right there is genesis 1 26 27 that's why genesis 1 26 27 is so important if you can understand that you can understand where you come from right what you're doing here and where you're going amen but i want you to remember everybody says no after the seal's broke brother brown changes no show me show me where he changed future home he says i've preached the same three stages of grace from the time i was a little boy amen and i have quotes here from 1964. but find me one quote where brother brown said you didn't need salvation that's right find me one he might have said you always was he might have said all this he might have said all that you had this little germ of life inside of you show me one place where he said well you don't need salvation anymore you just need to believe that ain't it happening right you can't destroy the plan of salvation glory because this plan of salvation was before brother branham got here and before you got here right before adam got here plan of redemption was laid out before the world was ever formed think of that god foreseeing now we're going to talk about in a minute making a way of redemption before he even made the world because why he knew we were going to come to right here because up here when we get to glory back to this spot right here this this future home when we all get together in the future home there's no sin there's no sorrow there's no shame there's no agony there's no virus there's no lying there's no stealing there's no you can see what i'm saying but if you weren't here to begin with you have nothing to go back to right because redemption remembers not replacement redemption is bringing you back to where you began glory everybody got that all right let's read uh first corinthians but we speak the wisdom of god in the mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world unto our glory remember god didn't need us we need god right and like brother dale god chose that he needed a body down here god chose that we the bride when he said let us make man he couldn't take that back he had to produce this right here amen everybody got that amen all right titus 1 1 paul the servant of god an apostle of jesus christ according to the faith god's elect the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness and hope of eternal hope of eternal life i thought we always was in hope of eternal life which god that cannot lie promise before the world amen began everybody got that but hatha look blood hath in due times manifested his word through preaching which is committed unto me according to the commandment of god our savior now let's go to ephesians one this is where we'll we're gonna i don't yeah let's read all of it well you know this let's go to verse four according as he hath chosen what us in him hold on us in him before the foundation of the world there we go back to that spot right there we're bringing it right back to here he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love verse 7 in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of what sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence look having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purpose in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times that's right now folks he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have what obtained an inheritance hmm obtained we had to go get it the bible says after you heard the word of salvation you received your new birth in other words after you heard faith comes by what hearing right right you had to hear the word before you can be born again why didn't paul just listen paul knew the old testament from kever to kibber right why didn't he just all of a sudden when god came to him he just said whoa man i'm this wonderful three days he went blind god let him chew on it for a little while and then he said no paul i i'm going to have to send somebody that's already in the body somebody that's born again and nice remember and nice had a little problem with it too because then i said i don't know if i'm want to touch that dude or not he's killing us but what did jesus what did god say god said go on he's my servant i've picked him and then the bible says his scales fell off his eyes and he received the holy ghost huh kind of simple revelation 13 8 all that dwell on earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of the life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world now also remember this is the book of life i mean book of life eternal section everybody got that book of life eternal because there's many different stages of the book remember when you come down here even brother brown says when you come into sanctification we'll get to this later on in sanctification your name goes on the book of the believer it's transferred there is a book of life and that's what's in revelations 19 or 20 when the book is open and all that are judged they're judged out of that book of life normal life you and i are already judged right here we were judged before the foundation of the world never to be judged again now you can hallelujah for that all you want to because i believe that because your name's in that lounge book of life you're right there and that's where you're going back to right but you also were in a book down here when you became on this earth there was a recording of what you were doing when you become to the age of accountability a tape recorder came on and you know what until you're justified that tape recorder stays on and if you don't ever get that erased you'll meet it over here on the white throne judgment right but brother chris if you come through justification sanitation and receive be reborn reborn not born this is born this is reborn everybody got that you need two births hey man you got to have a physical birth but you got to have a spiritual birth nicodemus you must be born from above oh i need to go back and get in my mother's womb he was down here carnal mind god was telling him he said what you got to be born from where above up here a spiritual birth have i got that number two prophet of god in christ the mistress that he has showed or revealed and every type that's in the bible therefore the entire bible is a revelation of god's mystery in christ the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had now what was that one goal get us back to right here he knew we were going to fall he knew we were going to fall but he knew he was going to have fellowship with us again right here but if we stayed like i said before realize this if we if he stayed right here he would just be father he came down here and became a son son of man flesh led brother dale said then you and i became son of samuel and peggy dale or whoever you your mom and daddy was right but that didn't negate this right here if you were right here but look you come down here you go savior healer redeemer all in all lily of the valley rose of sharon bright morning star you see all these all these attributes this eternal but he had to do that down here with someone that's lost as we read that quote that we'll read maybe if we get to it in ephesians church age to give him purpose he had to let man come to flesh and fall he had to let man come into human flesh and fall to to have him an eternal purpose right to get us back to right here listen once we once eve's womb was polluted with natural seed everybody got that now we're talking natural once her womb was polluted by natural seed her spiritual womb up here was polluted she couldn't get back to here we had to fall down here so it's called the fall one more time we fell down to here now what are we doing we're still we're continuing on with life and we'll get to it but we're going to come right back to there because redemption is not replacement it's bringing you back to where you were before real simple the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible all the acts of the believers in the bible has been entitled and expressing what god's great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed it and showed it amen i believe listen we're living in an open book but guys brothers sisters believe me brother brown didn't come to bring us eternal life right he didn't come to bring us a message to tell us how to get eternal life at the beginning it's always been in the bible right people were born again before the problem got here we know what his message was his message was what go back in the mind of god seals open when the seals opened the mind of god opened showed us right here where we were so that this guy can be changed listen by the new birth we've been since the 120 in the upper room they've been changed in their soul right but they had to die and keep dying and keep dying because he didn't have all the word of god you and i now have all the word of god to get us back to right there because of the opening of the seals it gives us a chance to take on a new body not a new different one this one made new so you can tell me all you want to the brother brown chain he didn't ever change the body he can't change the bible that same way with daniel 70 weeks i'll contend anybody right now the bible says there's one week left after the rapture i really don't care what nobody else says i'll take what god says but i know what brother ryan was talking about maybe you don't because he can't change the bible can't change the bible he shall make a covenant with many for one week and in the midst of that week he'll break the covenant there's one week left after we leave here to finish daniel 70 weeks so you just don't you're just not getting what he said you know what it is last night you know what i was thinking of this and i was going through it i was mulling over it just as plain as day something spoke to me and said there's that other spirit remember i've been preaching on two spirits because any other spirit contrary to what god's word is is the other spirit oh but i got quotes quotes will kill you didn't the pharisees say we got moses in other words we got moses message we got moses quote book jesus said if you didn't own him you know me if you know what he was saying you know what i was saying he came exactly as the word said and they killed him number three christ the mystery god revealed now god's great secret mystery now back in the back part of god's mind there was something he was going trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it well it was a motive to get us back through all of his after get all of his attributes back to eternal because he knew we were going to fall but he wasn't a savior right here he's a savior when we come down to here right amen everybody got that say amen all right so in his great mind number 103 these attributes to be expressed and then him was love and then we'll see there's his attributes father son savior and him was to be a healer there had to be something lost right to have a savior not just you always was we always was lost until god came into my life i promise you that now god had a purpose in a hidden mystery and that's what i want to speak on the church this morning the hidden mystery of god that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how that it unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living in then you'll understand clearly you see i believe what is being done revelations 12 7 there was war in heaven and michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought in his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven so here's heaven satan was right there when god said that but satan wasn't a part of that satan's not part of that genesis 1 26 come on people good grief but he was standing there when god said i'm going to have a group of people they're my children they're inside of me as attributes you can't see them yet just like daddy didn't see me until i was born but see god's not like that so chris he knew everybody i'll read you a quote in a minute where brother brown said your hair color what you look like god knew it for the foundation of the world your natural life he knew that revelation 12 7 prevail not neither was a place found in heaven the great dragon was cast out the old serpent called the devil and satan he was cast out where into the earth and his angels were cast out with him see they fell first they fell from their first estate talking about jude 1 verse 5 verse 6 the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he has reserved an everlasting change under darkness that unto the judgment of the great day so what happened they all came down here see see satan can work his way back and forth but he can't ever get to that he can just get over into another dimension then he work through one two three even four amen the devil go right through that building if he wants to but he come down here to what tried to destroy us to block us because that's what he'd done he blocked the spiritual womb and the physical wound he blocked it from us going back to here or from any of these children to be born because god can't come through an unclean vessel everybody got that so i said that god the bible tells us god won't dwell on an unclean vessel i was unclean were you not we all were everybody got that all right now let's read genesis 1 26 we know what that is let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and fowl the air over cattle and all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image and the image of god created in him male and female created he them that was right here before he even put him in human flesh that was right here and he gave and i'm lord forgive me he gave adam we're going to put some hair in the dress on this one he gave adam and eve dominion she was in him right then he put them two seven he put he put them together he put then he separated them put him in flesh then took a rib and put her in flesh so there they stand and it's still part of eternity because brother brown said time did not begin until the fall happened all right to me that's just pretty sensible so they were up here they fell down past that line right they fell that's what you call one more time it's why they called it fought they fell they fell down here to what die in humanity but remember before the world ever begun there was a lamb slain already for them there was a perpetuation already made for them before god even literally ripped the skins off of the um sheep and threw them in there told them to put these on right now genesis 2 7 says look and lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed in his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul i like that then he planted the garden and told him said hey till the garden but what happened was satan got involved and the beast got involved we know what happened then they fell they come down here into time and look he had the book with the names on it now you got to say oh no he didn't no he didn't but in symbolic this is all the names that will ever be saved in the lounge book of life the eternal sections everybody got that got it adam was going to produce this with eve by this spoken word not by literal seed like we're talking about because remember why do we why why one more time seed equals word and god only there's no other seed the bible says in what is it colossians where he says not seeds of many but one seed which is christ and what is christ he's the word amen amen in the beginning was the word where is it god where it was god i've got a big mark on the front of my plain little white coat here all right so now let's go to number four we start the fact that there are two seeds there are two trees in the midst of the garden now what's a tree a tree brings forth fruit right and in that fruit is seed everybody got that say amen the tree of life was jesus the other tree is definitely satan because of what came forth of the fruit of that tree now then we know that both of these trees had a relationship to man what the tree of life would keep you up here the tree of knowledge of good and evil would put you down here everybody got that amen the problem is though the tree of life can come down here and save us the tree of knowledge of good and evil can't go back up that way because we were born off the tree of knowledge of good and evil i'll bring you another quote next sunday where brother brown said you were born between satan and eve you were tell me how good you are tell me how good what all this great stuff you had inside of you oh i got quotes the pharisees killed jesus because of quotes they did not realize the essence of that old testament was standing in human flesh in front of them they read it by letter and they killed the very person that wrote it don't you think they're going to do the same thing today you're going to not be killed by how good or bad you are you're going to be killed by what you stand for and i say that personally or even like brother chris and i you know brother brown so you can't don't have to kill the man you just kill his influence and that kills the man okay but it's like brother brown said he says i was lost i was a cuckolder i'm fixing to read it to you in just a minute oh no that he had to be i was always a wheat plant well okay hang on man we'll see right here you are but down here you weren't to me that's so very simple that's so very simple you were not born wheat in your natural life but there was a representation of you right there that stayed there stood there did not move but it met you down here in time to me that's just so to me that really makes the plan of salvation it makes me love him more than from somebody just walk up and say don't you realize you always were eternal we were back there don't you just feel me and you were back there before the foundation of the world no i didn't know nothing until i was about five years old some of you might say 55 years old well i'm 61 now so i've known some for six years thank you very much yeah i'm 61 mile now we know that both of these trees makes hey that makes him old now then we know both of these trees had a relationship to man or they never would have been placed there they must have had a part in the look the sovereign plan and purpose of god sovereign nobody else is going to change it god already had it worked out knew that tree was going to be there knew we were going to eat off of it but he didn't make us eat off of it we chose ourself and we can never impute omniscience unto god this is all true so far is it not now look now the word most definitely sets forth that from before the foundation of the earth the purpose of god look was to share his eternal life with man amen now look if man can't get it now right here after adam and eve if man can't get it anymore the book went back into the original owner's hand the genesis 1 26 the list of everybody that was to be bride went back to the hands of the eternal god because he couldn't trust it with me and you anymore he couldn't trust it with seth he couldn't trust it with enoch even he couldn't trust it with these people down here remember this is all substitute this is all the blood of bulls and goats covered covered sin this has no sin so we were down here sinful god capo or covered us until we what cried out by father daddy daddy i need you and what responded that right there because she was back there as the woman in the well she was back there in that not as a person not as a being she was part of that eternal life to me that's just so simple you know what no but it confounds people that say oh i got this quote right here so i can quote a lot of things brother brown said evil woman is not no more than a bullet to the head you know what he said hmm just telling you i'm telling you we can sit here and we can quote and quote and quote and quote and argue and argue and argue and argue i don't argue anymore this is the truth i don't care nobody you can bring it on bring it on it better match the word of god first it better match the word of god first and go back to the saying brother branham was a word prophet he could not change the bible he only spoke to us the love letter but remember the love letter he said listen the prophet of god said now the listen if you're reading a love letter it can't just be something different than what's above it and what's below it it's got to be in continuity or the essence listen the very reason we're having birthdays should tell you that we were born wrong that person never had a birthday it always was all right um where am i at oh go to ephesians 1 in that right yeah according to he has chosen us we read that before the foundation of the world so i may be maybe four o'clock i'm sorry but we should be holding without blame before him in love i'm trying as fast as i can brother hal thomas says i run out past him sometimes i fly too fast having predestinated us until the adoption of children by jesus christ what to himself now wait a minute predestinated us unto adoption now the word predestinate is pretty destin or predetermined destiny have i got that but the prophet of god said god did not put you in a tube and pulled you through that tube that's predestined pre-determined destination i know you're going to preach on you got to still do it best i ever heard on predestination brother dale preached several years ago he said he was going to do it again but remember when did he choose us before the foundation of the world four f o r e b four having predestinated uh it destinated us before the financial world he predestinated us into the adoption of children by jesus christ because remember remember he's omniscient omniscient omnipotent he knows all things he knew when he said let's make man in our own image where we'd have to come back to there's not one person going to be saved that didn't get that wasn't up there all right right that's pre-destined it's predestined because he saw your destiny because right here we go for knowledge let's go to this right here for knowledge for knowledge four four oh i can't i can't hide it four anyway sorry pull it down here a little bit further brother joe or richard four for knowing b4 we knew it he knew it right for knowledge now let's read this quote right here smyrna church age everybody got it now then they were coming to a conclusion as the eternal logos god was manifested in the sun and then jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that eternal one was the father manifested in flesh by the little priests on this morning and thereby gaining the title of son not making him another son gaining the title of son even so we look eternal watch eternal in his thoughts not down here eternal in his thoughts right nobody got that eternal in his thoughts in our turn you had a turn right it wasn't just a blanket as soon as he was born you got eternal life wrong answer zach always said wrong answer ghostwriter that ain't gonna work cause that ain't redemption that's just saying you got it you ain't gotta do nothing eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many-membered what spoken word seed exactly not this guy this is dead seed manifest in flesh and those eternal thoughts right here those eternal thoughts now being made manifest because there was a man named jesus came and paid the redemption price so that we could get back to that and that could what find us we didn't find him he found us [Applause] i'll raise my hand toe sister hallelujah i'm glad he found me manifest in flesh and those eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of god even as we are so called look we did not become seed by the rebirth look it didn't change this right here that stayed right there but see people don't read the whole part right we are seed and therefore what you had to do something it didn't say therefore you always were eternal no you had to be re-born by a new birth consisting of justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost you were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed as a reason we could be quickened or reborn but there had to be rebirth in non-seed look did you do my red ink paint this is the billions of people on the earth today and has been since the foundation of the world they never were right there they were in the mind of god as a person as an individual as life he gave them life but he gave them a choice but he knew their choice because of for knowledge because of four knowledge he could look and see down through time who would and who wouldn't these just came and brother brown calls him cannon fodder now i don't call him cannon fodder but he did nothing but cannon fodder i got to find my red ink pen somewhere guys but that's the way you came and then i then i read you the quote and the bible says we're in continuance we came forth in other words he knew we were coming to but we had to come down here and get in this mix but what was our representation down here right here you heard from your theophany you heard from that eternal part you didn't come down here look you didn't come down here like this that's your soul yeah that gives you two souls you were lost now this found you because you were born i'm gonna put cockle burr cause we're gonna read what brother branham says you were a kookaburra and he was a cuckoo bird now what you gonna do with those quotes when you say oh no i i'm no i i'm always i always was yeah you always that seed always was but you had to go by reborn right you had to go through the process of rebirth now let's go to number five oh wait a minute that's what's this now y'all read these quotes up here and said oh i always was eternal i always had this eternal seed i mean yada yada yada but you didn't read this part this is the next paragraph just one more you know kind of between the lines of the level that are you supposed to read that when you read it at the top supposed to compare with the next quote redeem now why do we need redemption if we didn't fall from somewhere hold this carefully in your mind now take the next step redeemed means to buy back it restores to the original owner god by his death the shed blood bought back his own amen he bought back the spoken word seed bride my sheep hear my voice word and they follow me they always were a sheep oh wow now about yeah you always wear sheep this was this one down here wasn't this was always a sheep you got to watch that where he says you because i'm going to tell you i got you a million other places where you were a cuckoomer you never were a pig or a dog turned into a sheep that's because of this right here not this down here have i got that folks we were lost right without salvation a cuckolder doomed and on our way to hell all right let's go to the next quote number five okay look we'll cover this for just a few minutes the word predestinate that's not a good word to use the word for knowledge is better why because if you look and you say you look up the word predestination that means pre-determined destiny in other words it's pre-arranged you're going to take this destination and this is your end now see god knows that so it's not a bad word if you understand what you're talking about but now go lord brother brown says now the word for knowledge is better because look for knowledge now what does destiny do though predestination looks back to foreknowledge because the bible says those he foreknew look right here those he foreknew he did predestinate to come down here and take a journey but knowing that one day this was going to change into a wheat and then you go right back to there i'm just reading quotes you figure out predestination looks back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks to destination but god not making set it in order a little hole that you have to go through see that's predetermined right put you in a tube and say all right bro chris this is no i told y'all before god is so all-knowing he knew who if you married another girl what would happen if you never got married he knew what would happen if you only no god no for knowledge he knew you we limit god so much he's all-knowing but he saw that you would want it so bad because what the deep called to the deep cause there was a deep to respond i was lost why would i need to respond i don't listen at this point in your journey if you're born again your soul doesn't respond like that anymore it always was eternal because it has come together in a union read god's power to transform in a union brother brown said it's you and god now and there's persons and then i can say that's where i came from this is where i'm going i mean this is why where i'm at and that's back where i'm going to real simple but god not making said an order a little hole that you have to go through and can't go no other way see he would be an unjust god to do that he cannot judge you by making you do something but god in order to be god he knowed the end from the beginning so we had predicted and set things in order to happen by what for knowledge now let's go to number six where i think pentecost failed now the word is used here in the fifth verse of predestination predestinated it's not a very good word for an evangelist or a minister to use because it's kind of confusing people when you say predestinate look predestination speaks looks back to foreknowledge foreknowledge looks to destination predestination goes way back to foreknowledge right here the mind of god predestination goes back to foreign knowledge for knowledge goes to destination in other words god didn't say now i'll make this man be this see he can't be a righteous judge if he said i'm gonna make chris lost and i'm gonna wait make way saved he can't judge him for being lost all you got to do is look at god and say you made me this way you you made me this way you made me do that but no you can't do that we're all born free moral agents even after you're born again you've still got free moral agency i'll make this man to be that but in order to be god he had to know the end from the beginning so in order to foreknowledge that he knew he could say this would happen and that would happen because he's god and knowed where everything would be placed and therefore he could ordain certain things for certain ages that's why he ordained us to be in this age another age couldn't take what we're taking that's right another age couldn't take the word like we're taking the word right brother brown preached the countdown we're astronauts we're pressurized more than anybody else is now you say boy that's that no that ain't that ain't him picking one over another one he just knew by foreign knowledge you'd make it in this age and somebody else would not that's truly scripture all right let's continue reading number seven everybody all right for a minute i know it's 3 30 but you know what sit and watch a movie for longer than this watch this now listen to this predestination looks back to foreknowledge this is 1960 now i mean election election looks back to foreknowledge and predestination looks to destiny don't forget that that election looks back here here it is i was a cuckleberg i was born in sin shaped an iniquity come to the world speaking lives born amongst sinners father and mother and all my whole family sinners i was a kookaburra but all of a sudden raise it on up there i was a what i was a what huh but all of a sudden i became a wheat germ how did it happen that's what is that election god before the foundation of the world what elected that this kookaburra he knew i was going to be this but he knew i'd want to be that and he put it right there and he can't change it can't change god's mind god before the foundational world elected that the kokomor was to become a grain of wheat now i know i'm a grain of wheat because i'm saved i've been reborn how do i do it look back and see that he predestinated it long time ago by foreign knowledge he seen that i would love him so he made a perpetuation through his own son that through him i might become from a cuckolder to a grain of wheat now where am i at now i'm saved now listen the wheat always wasn't wheat because it was right here but remember we had a fall down here that put us down this way and we were cuckobers we were born wrong everybody okay with that my father and mother and whole family how could he say that that'd be kind of hard but he said all my family were drunks wow look at number eight questions and answers this is 1964 after the seals for those of you that need that how can i take a cuckoo bird and make a grain of wheat out of it it's impossible for me to do it reading the quote it's impossible for me to do it the only way it can be is because inside that cucumber has been transmitted from a kookaburra wheat right a kokober to a germ called wheat life wait a minute inside it has been transmitted we receive eternal life then you bury that kookaburra and it'll produce a grain of wheat because there has been a life of wheat put in that kookaburra everybody all right with that i'm just reading quotes after the seals for those of you that need that because there's been a life of wheat put in the kookaburra and the life of the kookaburra has been taken out but watch hold on he's not done yet but the nature of the kuckelber is still sticky and it will be until this new life has fully been developed out of the ground and raised up again when it comes forth then it's no more cocklebury he's talking about this guy right here now cause watch it when it comes forth then it's no more cooker burr but wheat but wheat but while it's here on earth and that in the out of the earth and the kookaburra it's still sticky but it's got the nature on the inside of it of wheat as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live that's right because you can't deny that you were born a human you can't deny you were born lost but the inside of you you're born again and when you're raised up you're in the likeness of christ and all that kuckelberg goes away cause remember you weren't a cuckold bird right here and when that thing bursts forth it does away with that and it puts you right back out right back where god's thought of you to start with and guess what you've done you picked up a flesh body during that whole journey you picked up a flesh body just like he did god was right here no flesh body he had to come down here and get a flesh body to die and when he died he took us right back to there all the sin is gone that's the thing i love that quote there number nine the token keep going i want to read just the red part the bible said he that's born of god just roll it back down sorry just let me read that whole paragraph the bible said he that's born of god does not commit sin for he cannot sin for the seed of god what what what don't sin the inside guy the wheat guy kunkelberg guy still does remember he's sticky but the inside the wheat guy he don't sin he's that genesis 1 26 man that's going to carry us back to eternal life in body spirit and soul the seed of god remains in him and how can he sin when the sinless god is in him when he's in a sinless god how can he sin no matter what he's done the blood's covered him see he's a new creature our creation his desires and ambitions is of heaven it was not when you were growing up and doing the things of the world you weren't thinking about heaven you might thought you were in heaven for some of the things that you did but it was white brother brian said oh that woman you know pulled the beer bottle up said this is life he said he didn't she didn't know that the very thing she called life was to kill her his desires and ambitions is of heaven because he's changed oh here it is again from a coca-burr to a wheat his desires ain't the same as they once was and he displays it go to the next one number 10. but what is it what we are this is 1961. we are now wheat a grain of wheat and god's garner when we was a cuckleber and god changed us from a cuckleburg to a grain of wheat it makes the fruits different changing your own mind your own ideas it's the greatest miracle that ever happened amen the greatest miracle brother is that you have been changed from the inside and god came down and give you eternal life and you become a new creation old things have passed away behold all things that what become new just listen if i'm wrong leave me alone i like this because i can love him more if i knew he saved me from that junk i was in than to just tell me i always was something and i was this special person yeah and listen folks please in god you were a special person i believe from the day you were born you had a special angel to watch over you because you know what satan want to kill you every second but there was an anointing over you that god knew by foreknowledge he had to let you get to 38 years old look at me 38 years old i wandered in the wilderness of sin for 38 years but he knew one day he would call and not answer and i'd hear from that right there now you can leave me alone like that that he thought enough of me to save me not just tell me i always was something but now listen but being born again and coming to adoption we look back into the mind of god and we see that that's where we came from we see that that's what god done but he doesn't negate or do away with the plan when a man or woman is born again of the spirit of god it becomes a new creature in christ jesus number 11. the rest read the red just for sake of time i was a cuckoo bird and he made a wheat out of me i don't know how it ever come i said how could it ever be he threw up his hands one day wherever it was on the railroad track or out in the hog pin or wherever he was and he said lord i'm done god had to save a prophet uh-huh god had to say paul didn't he so god had to say william branham too he was lost boy people don't like that well let's go to the next one we're gonna read this and then we'll stop we're gonna talk a minute about representation because you know what this is where i'm if you're born again everybody that's born again is represented right here book of your life book of life eternal section genesis 1 26 man seed of god word of god attribute of god son of god always was eternal never had a beginning never had an end never sinned never was lost we got lost down here in the kuckleberg part right but god came down in the kuckleberg park and brought us back to well they already this morning by the ministry of what reconciliation he reconciled us back to christ not to tell us we always was until you get up until you get born again and start looking and saying oh because brother brandon will tell you he said don't you remember when you were a young person and all your other buddies wanted to go out and i do i listen i joined in the gang sometimes but sometimes i didn't and it was because i think the the little the angel said now if you go out there buddy you're in trouble so i'd stay home i'd quit doing something brother brown said you remember you know you always they you know they want to go smoke and go drink or do something he said there's always a little something inside of you they said don't do that now listen that was god but you know what that was that was because of this right here not because it was in here i was hearing from something up here i was hearing from that angel that was given me that come from god and was not fallen that other angel folks if you don't like it you just brother dale said put it in your pocket and sit down on top of it there's another one sitting on this shoulder one of them fallen ones are sitting over here on this side going go ahead it's okay how many times you went down the road how many times you got out of a car and found out your buddy had a wreck i've known i've never happened to me but i've known a few people to do that and it really tore them up bad but but see that's god guiding us that i believe but that didn't make me wheat right that gave me representation that i was going to become wheat down here because of this right here everybody goes to the woman at the well i'm gonna ask you a question before we go down here before we go down this road how in the world now the bible says here's bible and by the way i'm listening for a minute you've been doing pretty good today the bible says now listen to me that we were born in sin right shaping iniquity and the bible tells us that until the day of pentecost i believe it's john 5. said the holy ghost had not been given yet everybody understand that because jesus had the holy ghost inside of him he was the only one that had it nobody in the old testament had it we'll cover that later but let's get down to jesus he had eternal life in his soul he was the soul of eternal life nobody got there but it was encapsulated in that body and couldn't get out remember jesus didn't save one person on this earth while he was on earth wow tell me one you said oh the woman at the well brother bram said she got eternal life folks that's another thing i'm telling you the bible says nobody got eternal life until jesus died you can't tell me a prostitute got eternal life before the 12 disciples did but you got to understand what he's saying she had representation i believe she went to the upper room i believe she was one of the ones in the upper room that's what i believe because i don't believe she wants no daughter of a god standing in front of in front of jesus that day she couldn't get eternal life he had it inside of him but remember he breathed on the disciples and said receive you the holy ghost now they didn't receive it brother brown said that was a what promise a few days later on the day of pentecost that's when the holy ghost came and went inside their soul burnt the kookaburra out and put the weed in but no look this little woman had nothing to present she was as filthy and as dirty as she could be that's me but notice way down in her she's got representation where way down in her where it wasn't eternal life in a place because she couldn't get it in her soul she had representation right here actually she was standing in front of her reputation her representation she was standing because you know what jesus said watch he said oh wait a minute what was her representation look and then she was looking for this to be made flesh she might have been a prostitute but somewhere she read a bible remember brother brown said mary would sit on on her mother's knee and she would read to him myself where a virgin shall conceive because look she's going to respond by what she heard right previously because remember look what is this right here see his word all right everybody got that way down in her she got representation see and then she was looking for this to be made flesh when he said go get your husband and come here she said sir i have none said you've said the truth because you got five and the one you have now is not yours you've had five that makes six you had she said sir not your belzybub i perceive that you are a prophet now we know she wasn't a bumbling idiot she had studied the scripture somebody had read to her the old testament somebody had given her what a seed word somebody had planted a seed in her right and she says i perceive that you're a prophet now we know the messiah which is called the christ will come and when he does he'll do this what was the response was what she had heard the word that was planted in her heart not an eternal place in her soul right sorry he said i'm he now look because she said what she said she had representation no more doubt you didn't have to explain it she saw it she believed it the way she went why what did it do to her it redeemed her potentially but that was her road she throwed her sins away her water pot down and ran into the city and said come see a man amen now watch he came to be a redeemer is that right what does redeem mean bring back why didn't he get the priest he never was up there he wasn't right there but she was that's right what does redeem me bring back why didn't he get the priest he never was up there see he had no representation he came to redeem that which had what fallen in the fall this got messed up with that girl but god had her in his thinking before the foundation of the world and he come to cleanse her then he she had eternal life where the priest what did it do to him it sent him right back to his destination he had nothing to begin only intellectual learning now listen friends if the only thing you've got is just quotes you get something different from that and you'll never be able to get it unless you got representation you'll never be able to get it right unless you got representation now let me read this one and i will stop right here proving his word 1964. he said salvation is of the jew woman we know what we're talking about he said you worship you don't know what a jew is supposed to know the word see how it was supposed to be but see he was watching now why he's going to what is he going to do prove his word why she he said by the way you go get your husband and come here roll on up please i know y'all working overtime i'm sorry by the way go get your husband and come here and she said i don't have any husband first thing she done was she didn't lie to the lord she approached him the right way she could have said but god i'm married i always was no i don't have one husband why he said you've told the truth see because you've had five and the one you have now is not your husband see watch something happened something took life now if it hadn't been in there to begin with and where in the seed word the word she heard the word she heard if it hadn't been in there to begin with if she hadn't had what representation from predestination amen it never took hold she had representation from right here the priest lived a life down here and never had representation up here because god knew they would continue to be cucker birds and deny the very word of god but he knew she was sorry for what she had done she had been taught wrong or something had happened but she had read enough of the word that's where the seed lays folks the seed don't lay in you the seed lays in that word right there because the word is a seed and the seed is a word you love the lord i got a bunch more but we'll we'll stop right here musicians come but that's what we're going to be talking about because we're going to bring some more quotes and things from from the prophet and like i said before you you can quote all you want to but see the thing i see is if we're not right we're wrong that's just the way it is i'll get it buddy you stay right there if i'm if we're not right we're wrong brother ray we just one way or the other thank you brother richard just lay it in there because i'll probably need it next week but i want you to understand i've heard ever since i come back in this message and thank god for a preacher that don't preach that stuff there we go thank you but you know what it's so close if you don't have somebody to separate it and break it apart and break it down like brother they did a long time ago and now then i wouldn't understand it i just said oh really i you know i always was eternal no i always was because i was in the mind of god i always was listen this is where you get your eternal life right from right here and you continue to grow because of right here and this was not in me when i was out there doing the things i was doing neither was it in you i just just quit denying what you were that's right i was a cuckoo bird the prophet of god said he was a koco bear we were all born cuckoo birds anybody that was born of a man and a woman in the culver but you had representation if you came to it one day you already had that representation and that representation remember i told you adam had to give the book back to the original owner right christ himself amen but what did he do with it he didn't keep it up here he brought it down here and started writing genesis exodus leviticus numbers deuteronomy then he what then this book was made flesh like he wanted it brother chris before the foundation of the world he wanted this right here to be flesh a body thou has prepared me brother they'll stop he needs to read that next that next one says low in the volume of the book i come this book right here this book was before the foundation of the world it had your name in it bill john it had your name in it it had my name in it but it was hidden since the foundation of the world only to be revealed when i responded that day when i was right here and wanted god to forgive me in my sins because i knew i was lost i knew i needed salvation i knew brother chris i needed justified i needed sanctified and i needed god to burn that cuckoo bar out of me and put something inside of me and what did i look to you say no i look to jesus christ well jesus christ is what the word was made flesh and dwelt among us this word now is being made flesh and dwelling among us no difference except that you were born wrong and he was born right that's the only difference between us and jesus christ he was born right and we were born wrong let's stand our feet god bless you thank you for listening but a body thou has prepared me that's what it was but he allowed mom and dad to bring your natural body here because he couldn't anymore and i want to ask you one more question wasn't mary magdalene i mean listen sorry wasn't mary the mother of jesus the bible says she had to go to the upper room and get born again right why didn't she need to do that she had something inside of her that was no she was still a cuckleberg had to receive seed she had to receive she said being under me according to that word sure the natural part came but then she had to go to the pentecost to the upper room to receive what she had birthed but not the natural person the spirit that was inside that person she received the new birth all right they didn't 120 of them stand up and say oh we always was this is it we always was no no peter said this is that though because where'd he go to he went right back to here book of joel he said this is that then i'll come and pour out my spirit upon all flesh and we're gonna be signs and wonders being happening and they burst out that door and they didn't care who bothered them or who wanted to kill them but chris they didn't care i wish sometimes we get to where we don't care what the world thinks about us i don't care what nobody thinks about me as long as i can stay right here as long as i can stay right here this is my shelter this is your shelter and you need to believe that this is your shelter this message of the hour and this bible is just like i've got it in there it's all in there together there's nothing outside that this wonderful prophet brought us it can't be different than what this is it's got to be out of right here and it is but you got to pray about it folks you can't just run wild that woman at the well waited long enough to where she said like hattie wright she said that ain't nothing but the truth come see a man that's told me all these things aren't we looking for him and i believe it changed her i don't think she even went back to that husband again i believe she said forget it i'm gonna follow this and she heard about somebody going in the upper room and she said i'm going to because she had representation and that representation brother ray where did it meet them at it met him in that upper room because there come a sound like a rushing mighty wind and it what filled all the people that were there they weren't full yet the bible said it filled them let's get a feeling today god bless you let's sing a song amen 281 381 let's worship just for a moment i'm just a passing through [Music] open door and i can't feel at home in this world anymore oh lord you know i have no friend like you if heaven's not my home they're gonna have to put her to sleep and do some work on her mouth so we're gonna pray right here everybody pray with us dear heavenly father in the name of jesus christ we pray that you would as this prayer cost is laid on our little granddaughter the lord that everything will be done for your honor and glory and shall come out of it just fine and everything will be well and nothing to bother anymore lord we thank you lord for these things that we're able to do this lord to bow our heads lord with this little cloth in our hand lord that we represent lord you father is going to the little child and her she'll be healed lord in the name of jesus christ amen okay no i have no friend like you if heaven's not my home then lord what will i do the angels beckon me from heaven's open door and i can't feel that home in this world anymore just over in the glory land we'll live eternally the saints on every hand are shouting while they shout because they once were sweden and now i've been transformed [Music] feel at home in this world anymore oh lord you know i have no friend like you if heaven's not my home then lord what will i do the angels beckon me from heaven's old window and i can't feel at home in this world anymore you know that the the plan of redemption to me is just it's perfect because god thought of it amen so why do we want to mess with it we were lost somebody had to come and redeem us out of the pawnshop i was dead i was a huckleberry i didn't need somebody to tell me that i could read it in the bible that i was contrary to everything that was in his bible i was doing the contrary right right but what about the transforming power of jesus christ that'll make you a wheat put that wheat life inside of you and it doesn't matter it's like brother brown said it doesn't matter if you see the kuckelber hall if god's put wheat inside of there when you put it in the ground what a surprise the farmer will get when it comes up and it's wheat amen that's what the bible the bible says ah you look i know john you you still you just still look just like you did before now i know she don't do things you used to but you still i don't know about that don't worry don't worry listen we put many shells of cuckoo kuckerbergs in the ground but they got that wheat germ in them they'll come forth because they had representation the ones that didn't have representation they're going to have to stay in their place in their dimension for at least another thousand years but not me and you that spot of that genesis 1 26 man this world is not my home my treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue you know the bible tells us that we're now sitting in heavenly places do you know if you're born again your soul is in another dimension god comes in gives you the new birth never tears a thing never has to cut you open to get right but what does he change you know what the first thing he changed me he changed my thoughts because see my thoughts of drinking beer and saying bad words it just bro michael it just like a 4 inch tube it just went but when i got born again brother chris that part of me that kookaburra part don't bother me no more that doesn't bother me sure now listen some of you young ones say well no you mean you never have trouble at all no you're gonna have worse trouble but you're gonna have something to fight it with you're going to have a wheat life to fight it with because listen a cocker burr a cocklebur fights a cuckober a kuckelberg can't fight a wheat that wheat germ will win every single time because that's what god did because you mom and daddy did this and put you in this body but see god knew that sister kathy he knew right where you'd be he knew right where mary would be all your children he knew right where they'd be and one day when they cry out to god it's going to meet what god saw before the foundation of the world and then you're going to see the transforming power of god will transform you from a cuckoo bird like i said though you're going to look shell in your shell you're going to be a huckleberry because that's the way you were born can't deny that when you came you came born in sin shaped iniquity you had to stay that on the outside sister alicia but on the inside i see a wheat because it will bear the fruits of that wheat germ that's inside of you you might look that's why you and i listen read a paradox a paradox is looking at something saying that's nothing but a cuckolder but it be an eternal son and daughter of god what a paradox the world can't see that now we show as an outward expression but sometimes they'll go now i don't know about yeah there's weed inside here because you're sitting here today it proves you're weak comes in here and sit and listen for an hour and a half and listened to us just you know we don't get excited and run the benches and and and i wish we could but uh one day we will because one day you'll realize listen one more thing before we go i promise you you are special it's like sister clayton and i were talking you know brother brown said he said god's a segregationist now he was preaching this in the 60s and that was kind of hard for a man to say out in them you know in the audience when there was the black and white segregation going on he said no god's a segregationist he said he told you to come out of her my people he told you not to stay a cuckoo bird he told you not to stay in this and not he wants he told the children of israel don't you marry nowhere but inside well what's the first thing it did once they started marrying outside god left them he had to put him away because they didn't do what he said but you and i please be born again please know that you know that you know that you got the new birth and when you do then you're wheat and you can't and listen you can't change the mind of god you got to go back to that your journey down here may be kookaburras all over but if you know that you know that you know that your wheat inside when you come up when you if we have to put you in the ground or if i have to be put in the ground go downstairs and look at them 18 year olds that we saw that 80 years old brother brother tatum couldn't even pick up nothing i can't do my fingers like his word you know why that's because of the kokomo on the outside but his fingers were way down here because of arthritis i'll never see that again i'll never see brother mo been over i'll never see brother george canada walking in like that's over that's done for that cuckoo bird has been put in the ground and gonna come back a week because if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwelling you it will quicken that wheat germ that had to go on the ground because of death christians don't die we don't die no way we don't die we just move over into another dimension and let this kuckerberg life just keep going this way but when we step back into this dimension no more kookaburra all wheat germ but some of us by the transforming power of god and by the opening of the seals as brother chris was talking about we're going to get a change to the kookaburra right here standing here abraham didn't have to go in another dimension did he get a body change did he god just changed him one night and next morning he woke up and said whoa i'm in the bed with the wrong woman is she gonna look over and she said where'd abraham go no they knew god had visited them and he said i'll visit you in the time of life and he said you'll produce a son you know what abraham just went to bed and said be it unto me according to thy word and and sarah said hallelujah that's what that's the simple faith that men you've got to have right for this virus for anything anything anything just say god you said it right you visited me listen when you got the new birth you were visited by god not by a second person he didn't send a messenger when he brought the new birth he brought that thing himself he didn't send he might have give you an angel to be with you during your life but when he gave you the new birth that was him i don't think he give it to nobody else to do but himself because he said i'm going to send you a comforter which is the holy ghost which i'm going to send in my name amen i ain't gonna send it no other body's name because they can't nobody change your cuckoo bird nature but the guy that made the wheat and the god that made you let's bow our heads heavenly father thank you for this day that you give us we pray now that you sanctified us for this journey lord and we'll come back together on wednesday night lord brother bob i'm sure he's traveling now from sweet water we pray that you should help him lord with the journey there being cold and rainy and same way brother louise lord we pray that you get them back safely be the ones that are not with us lord the ones that are sick ones are at home lord we pray that now that that you'll help each one of us as we come together lord now we've opened up the top lord for people to come in and worship we're still taking precautions lord because we're still a cuckerberg on the outside but lord we've got to believe that that transforming power of that wheat germ will cover us lord because you came and by your stripes we were healed by your suffering on calvary by you taking the nails and the scars lord you took every disease ever on the face of this earth that is now here or to come and you wrapped them up all in yourself and you said it is finished father then you came back on the day of pentecost in the baptism of the holy ghost to clean the soul out of man lord that was dark and dirty and dingy and cloudy all the way from adam to you lord and i thank you lord for the time that you cleaned this old vessel up lord i hope everybody will go home and sit in their in their favorite chair and they'll think of what you have done for them that you saved them from a life of sin not to just make you me something special or someone else lord but you're the special one and when you come inside of me lord then that makes me special because of you not because of anything else but because of you lord salvation is of the lord and we thank you for coming and giving us that lord a little part of eternal life lord and now we pray that you'd be with us on the highways be with each one lord as we go do our jobs and different things lord that you'll sanctify us for this journey be your brother dale lord and heal those things on his face and the bruises and all lord and have no problems with that lord we pray lord thank you for keeping each one of us lord the angels are encamped around us we just can't see him but lord we know in the times of our life that we've needed you lord you've been right there for us we pray that you'd bless us now and take care of us we love you lord in jesus name amen you're dismissed god bless you
