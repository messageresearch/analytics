loved ones now waiting on that Shore oh there he is always amen amen Amy's made their reservations to go to that place brother Adam told us some things that ought to be you've got to have reservations to get there it's not too late to make your reservation I like that they'll slow down we'll speed up you know brother random said in Christ revealed his own word he said heaven's just another dimension a little faster than this one so you know we talk about being caught up you know we think well let's you know we're going to shoot up Pastor milky white way and all that but you know it may just be catching up this way that just slow down we'll speed up because a faster Dimension say you're not going to be able to catch with these senses here Electronics the Ethereal waves things like that but uh it's going to slow down and it's going to catch us up into it and boy it will be off and running then trust you often run I'll tell you off and running now run this race with patience amen we have a great cloud of witnesses that can pass about us today amen we're so blessed today to be able to have brother uh Sam Dale pastor of the Spoken Word Church in Lula Georgia I've been here once before matter of fact it's about this time last year I think it was brother Dale it's when brother Dale's here you know the deer is running down in Sudan and so uh he wrote a waiter here and there and uh they've been hunting and uh so uh he's taking time out of his uh busy hunting scheduled to come by Ministry force today and I certainly appreciate that with all of my heart I do appreciate the uh the ministry the gifts that God has placed in his church and we recognize brother Dale's gift it's been a blessing to us and uh we want to just turn the service over to him and uh give him freedom and liberty to minister the word of the Lord to the people of God amen you know I don't know that song well enough to sing it again and it's every Vestige of it is gone so I'll just turn it over now to brother Dale brother Dale God bless you you're all hooked up I think now we got it amen God bless you we send you greetings from Oliver Church in Georgia and I would ask you to remember my wife she wound up she has migraine headaches and she had one last night and she had to stay at home this morning wasn't able to go to church so remember her she'll you know she's fought the Battle with him for years and they're getting better but that's you know that's one of those things but good to be here always good to be here we had a wonderful time when brother Jim came out and preached for us and all and just we really enjoyed it I enjoy the the word of the Lord don't you so let's just go into the scriptures if you'd like to turn in the scripture to follow along with us turn to Joshua 10. Joshua 10 and we'll begin reading about verse 12 and then we'll get over to Hebrews 1. so Joshua 10 Hebrews 1. I'm just the kind of a guy that I like to speak to people and and I like to get you to thinking I don't like to see you standing there with a blank face and you know I mean I'd rather see you frowning than to see you with this blank I'd rather see you saying what in the world is this guy talking about than to just I don't care what he says yeah but I'd like to get you to think because that means that God can speak to you've read a random said a minister and only one thing a gift and he said that gift was to get to block that spell that Satan has over your eyes he said where God can speak to you so that's all a gift is for and that's what we're doing okay let's pray father we thank you for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for this day and this opportunity Lord we love you and we pray that you would just come this day now and speak to us touch our wife Lord and let everything be well to me with the church there we know they're already in service and just bless and take care of everything be Wade over at Bartlesville Arbor brother cloud and images blessing just let your love be made manifest with each one of us as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts because we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen and I came off and had to bar glasses because mine's left in the cabin so if I don't read right it'll be Jim's fault you know reading through other people's glasses you know all right verse 12. very familiar with everybody then it's fake Joshua hey man I can read it here I didn't need no glasses brother Jim okay all right then speak Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the amorites before the children of Israel and he said in the sight of Israel Sons stand thou steal over upon gibeon and thou moon in the valley of agilon and the son stood still into Moon stayed until the people had Avenged themselves upon their enemies is not just written in the book of jasher so the son stood still in the midst of heaven and hasted not to go down about a whole day there was no day like now get this point and there was no day like that day before it or after it that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man for the Lord fought for Israel now let's go over to Hebrews very familiar everybody knows it all right God who at sundered times in diverse manners spake in times past in the fathers by the prophets so you know what's the prophet of God said he's fake in the prophets that word by should have been translated in but it's fine because it's okay all right and half in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things but whom also he made the worlds amen you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now you know mankind says they can't trust the Bible because it was written by man well you know that's right in a degree of pinning it speaking it you know bringing it to us those things are true but we read in the Bible that God LED those men see all right so now don't misunderstand me when we get on over into the message in a minute of anything you'd think I'm trying to say I say what I mean and I mean what to say it's whether it's good or bad that's the way I am I just say what I mean so don't try to figure out what I'm talking about just listen and see we know that the Bible then was brought to us by Prophets man brought the Bible to us God used that man all right now it was at one time there even with Moses you should remember that uh God wanted to speak to all of Israel but they chose for a man to speak to him all right so then God said okay that's the way I'll do it I'll do it through man I'll bring it to you you know and see then we are the ones that chose it you say I wasn't back there to do that but we were because we're human all right and when they chose that that put us in a category to where we must believe what man says now if the man's wrong and it proves to be wrong then we don't believe him right I mean sensible if it's something out of the Bible it's not right there's doctrines trinities Etc that we're taught by man that we don't believe but that was days gone by we're supposed to be today the word that we can believe the word of the Lord but if you notice there in verse 14 as I emphasize he said God hearkened to The Voice of a man now you know I believe it this way and uh this is where I've always taught it to my people when brother Jim came out and spoke to us I invited him to come I believe the Lord LED it and all like that and you know I believe that's God's way of speaking right if I hadn't would have called him okay yeah I believe that's the way of God speaking so then there was a ten other guys supposed to come in and preach you know I mean it wouldn't have mattered to me and you know if if brother Jim was scheduled to preach and and and uh Obama wanted to come I I said sorry I got a speaker schedule you know I don't care about what you believe or whatever but I got somebody schedule because I believe that's God's way of speaking it's through man to us right now that's my whole points right now remember and we're going to get some scriptures in a minute to bring out something I have a odd way of approaching something so follow the approach and at a while I say okay now you're ready here's what I got to say okay all right now even in the writing of the Bible I'm believing because some of these notes I I had to write myself getting here and changed a few things but I believe it's in the second seal that brother random said that God gave to Moses a thought he said first it was God's thought he said he gave it to Moses as a thought he said it was not the word he said but then when Moses spoke it it was the word so you understand now the word was written before the world and coming down that's the point that the prophet received the thought what how did um how did Abraham say why did he say I'll give you a tenth of this form I mean what was that number off the top of his head well then we pay a 10 percent tithe don't we I mean see that would fit together that God before the world transmitted down through the the to Abraham and he just didn't pick up a number and say well I'll give you 10 percent right you were to give him 90. right now right but see but when it was finished it's in God's word then it all fits all the way through and then you'll see that it's been God the whole time leading the writing of the Bible that's my whole point all right so then it was not the word until Moses spoke it out right then it became words unto us all right now what about that man no that walked out there one day and he said I know he done it through through Aaron but he went out there and he said let there be flies and they came Let There Be fleas frogs Etc it came right by the words of a man the Bible said that he plagued Egypt with his word actually through Moses he plagued Egypt with the words from a man right now that's that's the point I want you to look at and let's turn over now to another scripture and pick it up look at Exodus 32. all right Exodus 32. we'll begin reading about 30. now I got a Sly way of sliding things in I say that to where you'll remember what I get when I get back to it after a while and I'll put my point in and then I want you to catch it and if you don't catch it I'll come back and tell you what it is me but then you can look on people's faces and they go see they're getting the point okay I'm carnal enough but that's just me forgive me but look look what he says in verse now 30 of Exodus 32. and he came to pass on tomorrow that Moses said unto the people now you know what this was with the golden calf situation and all of that you know look what he said he said unto people you have sinned the great sin and now I will go up unto the Lord free adventure I shall make an atonement for your sin I remember that Moses making atonement Moses returned unto the Lord and said oh this people have sinned to Great sin and have made them gods of gold yet now if thou will not forgive them their sin if not block me I pray thee out of thy book which thou has written we know what happened God told Moses said okay I won't kill him he said I'll deal with them and he did he said they won't go into the land but they'll go up to it they'll get around it they won't be able to go in but he said now I'm going to spar him now now I know so many thousand died that day but the biggest portion of Israel out of some 2 million they went right on their Journey going on towards the Promised Land all right now we know what brother Branham has said about this of reading the scripture you know block my name out and uh I don't feel on some of these I have to give you all of it because I'm standing before congregation is well taught and you'll know even the quote and we were laughing a while ago about my cut and paste really it's cut and tape all right they laugh at me at home but we get it done now we know that brother Branham said that he even had trouble with the fact that Moses could tell God a better way of doing something you know he said if you blocked him out blocked me out all right so we know that that was not Moses brother Brown said on the message souls in prison paragraph 77 or 1 cent 117. he said that always posed on me how that God could tell Moses Moses could tell God a better way than God had until I found out that it was the spirit of Christ in Moses well now we're back in Hebrews one right that God in the prophets they spoke to man so we're not putting the honor upon the man the honor is going upon the God that was feet which you can't leave the man out of the situation it can't be done it's got to be left that way so he says you know if you're going to do that block my name out all right but now listen to this one this is taking looking away to Jesus which is paragraph 83. the brothers are putting them up and they're real good at that and that's they do it at home I hand them these you know but I didn't hand these so they're they're getting ahead of me okay but look what he said and there was another one that puzzled me that was when Moses paragraph 85 could tell God a better way than God knowed how to do anything when Moses said the people will say your God was able to bring you out but not able to keep you and Moses threw himself in the breach then later I found out that Moses that that was Christ in Moses standing for the people now we'll get to it in a minute that's actually quoting numbers 14. all right the one we read was Exodus now we'll get to number 14 in a minute and you'll see but see just don't don't lose the point I tell you that because see that's actually in numbers 14. all right which is another situation that Moses has to do the same thing but this is what I like he said in modern events made clear by prophecy paragraph 57 that he's the same yesterday today and forever he said it was Christ in Noah it was Christ in Moses it was Jesus Christ in David it was Jesus Christ and Joseph it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and it's Jesus Christ among his people today doing the same thing that he promised he'd do in that age all right so now we know the story then that the real man is the man God you know himself speaking through a man but he doesn't do anything apart from man okay so now watch the point as we begin to just lay it down just a little bit then even God allows a man brother Branham on The Sixth Seal he said he was out there and God was revealing those things to him and listened to a prophet I don't have this quote but he said God I can't tell them that a man could house sit your connection to the mind of God that he could say is just as Moses would say you blocked him out blocked me out he wasn't playing games his life was on the line right but he knew how to deal because over numbers when we read that in a minute she'll see it a little better he knew how to deal with God and during numbers he says now it will be said Mr quote again that you could bring him out but you couldn't take them in he knew how to deal with it now this may be carnal to you but even Balaam with a prophetic gift he could not curse Israel right because God said you can't do it right but with that gift in the presence of the Eternal God he could back out of there and tell balik I can't curse them but I'll tell you how to get them defeated just get them more about women over with them get them men around them more about women because they were pretty and the Israeli women wasn't too pretty because they're out there living in the deserts and like and you know the story so he goes and they get them there but now I don't lay it all against all things but I just put it all together you know a lot of those Israelite women wanted to look like him more about women that's why you got them bite in their faces and all today you know they still want to be the more about women but just making that point but just think Moses said God they will say you were able to bring them out but not able to take them in you know what Moses what God told Moses turn over to numbers 14. see what he told him and we won't have to read all of it to get down because you got the story then of It Go Just Right Back above in verse 13 14 15. we get down to verse 20. he said pardon I beseech Thee the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy that's just after he's finished telling them they will say you could bring them out but you couldn't take you couldn't get them in so it's going to be against your name and we're going to read a quote in a minute where he brought around and said he promised him so Moses was reminding god of the promise so look what he says and his thou Hast forgiven this people from Egypt up until now you know that works you've been forgiving them you're going down below here in the next verse or two you'll find that they sin 10 times from the time they left the Red Sea or you know left Egypt to Katie's Barney I think 10 times and you know God was ready to take him in you know the sin that kept Israel from going to the promised land the big one Katie sparnia when he didn't believe God's word when he said I give you the land and God says that's it I can look over you here and look over you there and look over you ten times but you ain't going because see they become unbelievers right but look what he says in verse 30 verse 9 20. and the Lord say it I have pardoned according to Thy Word and what about the words of a man that he could so go before God get an audience with God he'd know the mind of God and know what he was fixing to do but yet he could turn around and use that gift that was in his life to be able to what would be a word for it I don't have any education but be able to bargain with God or deal with God or whatever words you would use you know he would be able to talk to him in plain language he said now look you blocked their name blocked mine out don't let it be said that you could bring them out because he knew they was out we said you can't take them in because you promised them you'd take them in all right let's see what brother Raymond had to say that's why I like to read what he has to say you know man this is from the message presuming e24 you can come on down and watch what he says said he would have killed the whole world he said that was Christ in Moses he would have killed the world and everything but look Christ wrote himself into breach for the whole human race we know that Moses thrown himself into bricks for Israel and he said you made a promise God you made a promise that you'd take them to the land that's right what did Moses do to God listen we're reading what he said what did Moses do to God when looked like God was going to do something contrary he throwed the word in his way now reading right around him he's up behind you here he throwed the word in his way see amen I love that right around it says I feel like shouting just talking about it put the word in the way God can't walk over his own word all right said you promised to do it you said you would take them to the good land that was flowing with milk and honey I've told them what you said listen and here we are we're on your hands see he knew how to deal with God all right look on down to the next one the message on the second seal paragraph 54. right down at the bottom you get all of it coming down to it but and their Moses took the place of Christ then to throw himself in the breach and say don't do it Lord see and of course and of course he after he'd ordained Moses to do this he didn't come over Moses they said right around I'm saying that once you because he was acting like Christ in that time that was Christ in Moses he ordained Moses for the job and he wouldn't come over him then we know he was kind of discontinued with him back there when he smoked a rock right and we know that caused Moses to not get to be able to go to the promised land as a walk-in he was 800 years later coming in the scripture but yet he wasn't able to go but you see he could he could go before God being a prophet that's why I mentioned Balaam Balaam could go before God he could see the Holiness and righteousness of God but he couldn't curse Israel but he could go before him and look at it and he'd say if I can just get them to do something wrong you remember even Balaam was shown the hinder part in other words the worst thing that could be happening in Israel he said I don't see it he couldn't go over it but yet he come out of it with an understanding that's what brother random says you got the lion the ox the man the eagle he said the man is shrewd he uses his mind you see it in the message you see preachers that they don't care what the word says they're using words to get the mind to the people and they can get them on that side and they'll say well the brother is a wonderful brother so yeah but he's off the message but but but he said he believed the prophet some people told my wife years ago this right eye would come in the message about a man named Lowry over in India and she said I darson say anything about him he said because he's God he's preaching he's God my wife she said does he believe right around his message she said well no he said he he he says brother Ryan was wrong you know and change it well I said well I don't give a hoot I can say what I want to do about it you know maybe she didn't use the word hoot that solid language okay but the point she wasn't worried if he was off the message but you see the shrewness of man's mind man's words you can take a man's words and you can twist you I know your pastor he knows the truth about any Doctrine you call a brother round's message and I'll give you a quote from Brother Branham from memory it will sound like it's contrary is that true he said one day he said now you know he was always one true and living God he said one day let's stand and address the third person of the trinity right now did he believe in a trinity no that was your Trinity he was telling me Lester just one you want to talk to you he didn't believe in it himself but see man's words can be twisted and make things that's what they do in the message they take so much of the message and then they twist it to where it's just Twisted enough and until now they're saying that even Jesus done wrong um great following Joe you know well I'm just honest now if if I follow a Doctrine I don't mind telling you I'll follow it no problem you asked me what I believe I'll tell you and I won't sugarcoat it either I'll tell you up front what I believe and then I'll tell you why I don't believe something else you know see because that's just the words of a man all right but now look God has got to keep his promise look at the last quote we'll give you sir as we would see Jesus paragraph uh E36 he said if God don't keep his promise then it's not God's word God couldn't be God make a promise and then not keep it all right now at the words of a man God was fire Israel at the words of a man he would actually say I pardoned those people now without going back and reading it I want to just get the whole story now oh that's background we read the scripture where that in Exodus 32. and after they had made the golden calf and the great sin Joshua said I'll go up before the Lord and said pre-adventure I can make an atonement well we deal with basically don't blot out and just blot out that's basically you're preaching from that point but I want you to think about what is an atonement it's a covering you know a lot of times Moses would tell Aaron say take your sense or run among the people you know and make an atonement right there were more atonements than just a lamb or a goat or things and like I said he'd tell Aaron said take your sensor run in off the fire into the altar get that go among the people and make an atonement for him make a covering Farm but I want to ask you a simple question this is the whole message one nutshell what was the offering Moses made when he said I shall make an atonement what was the offering it was not far off the altar even though Aaron done that and that was it was not a ram a gold or a lamb or whatever what was the atonement it was his word excuse me it was his word he reminded god of what he had said brother random says you find it in the Bible call God on the scene he'll do it because he said it and he can't deny his word Moses never offered any animal he never even offered fire from the altar it was his word you blocked him out blocked me out same thing would be on over in numbers when he'd come to that place that he began to deal with God and say God it'll be said that you could bring him out but you can't take them in so don't let that be said so keep your promise he reminded God of his word think about that the words of a man now we established that that man speaking through Moses was Christ right speaking to Joshua was Christ but there was a connection to the human man that you cannot separate and I read you the quote or showed it to you there we did that he said he chose Moses for the job and he would not go over him oh I know I'm carnal the way I speak but I'd like to make you think if Peter said in Acts 2 repent every one of you and go off for a ten dollar bill that would have been what it was and if you got the Holy Ghost you'd have done that but he wasn't going to do it that way why because the mind of Christ was in Peter to tell him what to do see the mind of Christ come through Moses and told God a better way of doing something the atonement Moses made was his own words that he took before the man so you know what we are building the words of a man does it said about brother random when he was talking on the Sixth Seal he said Lord I can't tell them that what about I know this is going to be short and sweet so I like it what about a man that could stand in this day he said let her be squirrels God didn't tell him how to speak that he just told him what whatever you have indeed I was speaking go through the life of brother Branham then of the things of the third pool and the things are speaking to the uh storms out of existence the uh you know the the growth that was on his wife the the things that he spoke of sister had it right took the words of a man that said I give you your children sure I heard years later and they I don't know about it they said they'd both Beck's lead but I don't bother me how many times you ever backslid huh see brother random said it now that's not for everybody because brother Brown said it to the person huh but get the point what atonement do we need today what do we offer we don't go get a lamb and crucified right we've got God's word I thought we believed in like Romans 18 everybody's in there that you believe in your heart and confess with your mouth you'll be saved you know what you're doing you're reminding God of his word right he said if you do that in Acts 2 you'd be saved repent everyone and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and he shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost Promises of you and your children and pharah you're just reminding God right it don't bother God for you to remind him what he's saying come on how many daddies in here especially granddaddies now that's the worst part but how many daddies in here your kid comes up and say daddy you told me you know that you do that well where's humans sometimes we can't do it maybe but we should tell them say well we can't do it so but you told me to do it that's the way my kids always done me they just come to me and they said daddy you told me was going to do this or we're going to do it or not yeah not a problem you know well especially grandkids now they're they're in a greater higher category and well they can really get to you they don't even have to remind you of what you're saying they just look at you and you just go do it come on go to your granddaddies and everything else but you know my whole point is one thing a man with the word of God did Brother Reynold make this statement he said a believer with the word of God in his heart speaks that by faith he said it's deity speaking it was Christ in Moses it was Christ in Joshua it was Christ in brother Branham now I don't want to raise our hands because I don't do that but how many of us needed the grace of marriage and divorce have you ever noticed wrote a random Satan I say unto you said from what God showed me up on that mountain you go back and you see Moses had a Grace you go back and you find out that Paul had a Grace at the words of a man We Stand today and the words of a man that came that God Vindicated to to be the prophet of the hour that's why we don't look for another one all right because it may be great anointings out there but they don't have a message they don't have a message pointing you back to God they have a message pointing to their billfold in their own things right but at the words of a man we stand on that every day I wasn't dire when brother Brown and spoke squirrels was you I believe it happened why because of the message he preached would tell me that can be done I wasn't there when Moses crossed the Red Sea now I know we got the quotes right around and say I was back there with you know what I'm talking about but you know what I'm saying you and I wasn't back there physically walk across right I believe it happened the reason I believe it happened is because it's like brother Brandon when he was preaching one day and he was bringing that out about Joshua you know and his son stood still and he said I'd love to have all afternoon he said or something to speak on and God Stood Still you know son stood still and he'd say look at um the little woman with problems and she touched His Garment and said to Sons Stood Still what about all those places in there where that God would step on the scene and to prove that he was God what about the The Prostitute that was brought before him and they said now the Bible says in other words to us the law says she's to be stoned what is your judgment he couldn't say I forgive her that would have been contrary to his own word so he couldn't do it but he knew how to take care of it right so what'd he do he knew under the law if you had two or three Witnesses you'd Stone the person to death right I just got rid of the witnesses right that's what he done he's got rid of the witnesses he just condemned them of what they were doing they all walked away he said who condemned you she said I don't have no connection he said neither do I go and sin no more why because I believe Jesus was a man yes the flesh but in that flesh was almighty God not the doctrines that's going today and that's all right that's their doctrines I gotta as the other day I was down in the woods and I was reading on anointed once the end time I don't see a lot of deer but I could do a lot of reading now but are listening to tapes because I got an iPod and I just stick it in I went through three tapes sitting there on this deer stand you know just listened running around my house slept through half of them and you know but I was like reading on anointing once the end time you know and it really struck me he said those people can't help it don't throw off on somebody that doesn't believe like you believe because you know what they can't help it they've heard the words of a man in the wrong direction they've listened to man Express things and they've went after the wrong thing but you know that can't help it that's not going to save them I'm not going to do it but I pray that God will be lenient you know those are wonderful people but they're caught by man's ideas but my point was what what atonement did Moses give it was his word he reminded God of his word marriage and divorce brother Reynolds spoke to us and he said I say well you know what you may not need the natural Grace of marriage and divorce but there's not a person in the world that didn't need the spiritual Grace May differ with me on that that's all right but even brother Brown I'm carried a Baptist Bible and converted them to a Baptist faith that's what he said we all need the grace of marriage and divorce have you ever thanked God have you ever repented for being in the denomination sometime you ever done that no the Holy Ghost let me out okay okay have you ever thanked him for leading you out have you ever just said Lord I was sincere there and I was I was 23 years old I was an ordained deacon when I left the church I was teaching the adult Sunday school times the deacons and Elders that's what I was doing when I left they thought the world of me what you see when this message came I couldn't do nothing but move I could have been told them in the church I got them told everybody I said I'm sorry I can't stay here I've got to move on yeah my brother came out and he said any minute he said what are you going to do I said I don't know he said are you a preacher I said Heaven Help I certainly don't know about that and he said well just stay and we'll build you a church and he meant it he said we'll build your church in my family would fill this church up my family would fill it up all right because I'm the baby of 13. four died real early but nine lived on got a big family all right but my point of what I'm saying I couldn't help it couldn't help it a friend of mine was speaking there not too long ago in the church where we used to go and I went to hear him not a problem I don't figure I've actually it because I went back there I went to hear the man and encouraged him you know young kid coming to but you see the point of what I'm trying to get whether you like it or not you can say oh it's a holy ghost it's this you're you're built on the words of a man whether it be that or whether it be the quotes of the prophet and I sure like the atonement that the prophet made I may not have needed the natural but I surely needed the spiritual I made this statement I said Lord you've got me out of the Baptist now get the Baptist out of me you ever done that just say thank you Lord thank you for saving me there's not a day passes that I don't pray Lord thank you for saving me thank you for delivering me thank you for bringing me into the word at the words of a man stood one day in a church told him I said Wade is actually it but he will come back I said leave what you want to the Lord told me don't know why something one day I said that'll take place or I'll quit preaching she said well you just preached tonight's sermon she was honest she said you just preached your last sermon I said well okay what you want to happen but I'm just getting a point not coming to my wife I have to wait come back to the Lord before he came back I come to wife I said now this a little more been added to the story do you know okay I said he's not only going to be coming back to the Lord but he's going to be preaching with me she said well okay you know well he's preaching with me my point is this we think that the word comes to the prophet now we know that I've established that established who it is it's Christ and what's taking place right all right so you shouldn't have any open part or any problem with these statements but brother random one we read one of those he said and he's still the same yesterday today and forever you know he's still using men to speak to us he's using a five-fold Ministry the Bible does not say that the prophet was made for the perfecting of the Saints it says the fivefold ministry but now if that Pro if that fivefold Ministry Don't Preach what that Prophet said they're not a faithful Ministry forget it you know it read around and said to five full Ministries predestinated eternally he said but the nine spiritual gifts in the church is not give some callers without repentance but he said five four minutes because really see that's God we're building the words of a man you know that sometimes brother Jim has to say something that probably if a lot of you heard it you wouldn't agree with him you'd probably condemn him but sometimes we ministers have to say things sometimes we have to speak things well I don't believe that brother Brandon was the only one that could speak the word I believe he come to bring a bride to the position they could speak the word well why can't you speak it for your family you've got a child you got loved ones you've got a husband or a wife or whatever to speak the word for them and say it and keep saying it till it comes to pies because if you say it for a while and then say well I really don't know so you never did have it right to start with it wasn't God but if you keep speaking it and it'll finally come to pie should be God that's the way I believe God I still believe that he's speaking through a faithful Ministry for the perfecting of the Saints see the words of a man and you know sisters now we don't believe in women preachers right okay my brother Ryan said you got your own Pulpit at home with your children and see it's not just the words of a m-a-n masculine you know that's why I read that in Hebrews he says what in this day he has spoken unto us through his son so what's the sun in you that's the way women preachers you know they'll say it a lot of times they say well I've got god in me I've got a man in me why can't I preach well we know that's not correct but you do have God in you preach to your Pulpit at home you claim your children this is not just made for a man to have to speak it well I wait a brother Jim speaks it which Revival was it was started and they checked back to find out that it was the lady that cleaned the church and she would just doing the pews you know and she just cleaning it and she'd say there's brother sets here Lord blessed and sister sets here and calls a Revival to come into church the words of a man and you know what now I'm going to end it by saying this to make you understand it was Christ in Moses you agree Christ in David Joshua et cetera Etc but now if I cross a Doctrine I'm sorry I'm just I say just this way none of those in the Old Testament had eternal life by the new birth right there was no new birth because the Bible said Jesus had not been glorified he's in the Holy Ghost couldn't come until Jesus came and released that life to come back to give us a new birth that's why you got an Old Testament in the New Testament okay simple now fell under the blood of boys and ghosts listen to Bread around them if they could speak flies fleas and frogs he said why would you stumble at squirrels under the blood of Jesus Christ so I believe he spoke to them squirrels into existence I believe he come to bring me the word this is my Bible it was give to me but this is my Bible don't belong to you this is my Bible this is my message you know holding up brother randoms quotes I can't say it belongs to you because it's mine there's just one God and he's mine well see you've got to say that man there's just one God and he's mine because see you don't know whether I have God or not at the words of a man we put our whole life I mean what if he came along now they've tried to do it you know they tried to prove that brother Branham was an illegally hunting out there in Arizona did that stumble you know what if they come up now and they put out a doctor and then put pictures up and showed brother Brandonwood and he was standing there and he had 14 women lined up down through there and said all of them was his wives what would you do see when dinosaurs said and all that came well sure that we know that's right which they couldn't be but even if it was he brought me to an understanding of God's word I would Glory no matter what anybody would say about him our glory in the word that he's brought me the words of a man that we stand up what do you think about it you got to depend on somebody brother here's probably the oldest what are you about 65. you know what he got depend on somebody right that was the old riddle of the springs how many of you in the school level talked at and I tell that to people they say where'd you go to school the old red leather stinks what starts off and you know four legs lend it with two legs and one to the end on three and you had to solve the riddle this man he starts off crawling four legs he stands walking up end of it he's got a walking stick he's got three legs that solved a riddle it was called a riddle of the stinks you see Church we're dependent upon what somebody says pray for your pastor because now if you're going to stay here and he's going to be your pastor he's your link to God no bless God I depend on all right see you're not in the you're not in the field I'm talking about if you're going to say bless God I've got my own Holy Ghost and it'll lead me and I ain't dependent on nobody we'll go home you're a hindrance that's what I tell them at church don't come if you're going to have a Doctrine like that you're hinders to me and I'm a hinders to you but we move on with God yes and we depend upon the fivefold ministry for the perfecting of the Saints because they're predestinated to that gift brother Jim has one gift I have another because Tommy has another we're not all the same I wish I could have a gift that these brothers had or remembered names I finally got to remember Tommy I heard it ten times last night I said one of these days I'll remember that see that's why I love the Lord because he's that man that's leading all of us and all of our honor and Glory goes to him come on with you the man Christ Jesus it was back there who could speak now he's here and can speak through you wonderful day isn't it amen praise the Lord the only thing wrong with that it was too short but I got enough to finish it up I'm just kidding now the Lord has spoken this morning and uh it's not the amount of words that's spoken it's the value of that which is spoken and what we receive like the naturopathic doctors will tell you it's not actually how many vitamins you take it's what you can metabolize it's not how many books you read or how many tapes you hear I mean those things are good but there's not necessarily more grace that's ministered because of that but it's how much you retain it's how much you that actually you metabolize spiritually that causes a causes growth amen and that's what the word is to do we're not going to measure it physically you know day in day out day in Day Out but we know now that there's a restored Eden that's begun and we've been invited back into the Garden of Eden to eat from the Tree of Life we know there's a change taking place what Adam failed to get now the bride in this hour absolutely sidesteps the grave cheats death and continues to eat word upon word upon word upon word and it'll change us into his glorious image I believe it was David that asked the question in Psalms chapter 8 and verse 4. he said uh he said when I consider the stars and the heavens I can just picture David just gazing out under uh under a Starlet night and he said Lord what is man that thou art mindful of him what is man what is man what's his value what's his worth well our brother helped us to understand David's Dilemma not necessarily a dilemma but he's asking the question man brother the Bible says God's age and he said he could have chose the trees to preach that would have been a sight wouldn't it we could be if God had chose a tree we could have been sitting out on an L train today or either brought to yam Tree in here whatever but we would be adjusted to it if that's what God's I mean that's God calls us to believe some of the strangest things sometimes but that's what separates us from from everybody else but David said and I like his answer here when the Lord apparently responded back he says thou has made him a little lower than the Angels his crowned him with Glory and Honor hence made him to have dominion over the works of thy hands and has put all things under his feet now what he told us in Genesis gave us dominion over everything all the sheep and The Oxen and all the beasts of the field the foul of the air the fish of the sea whatsoever passes through the past of the sea O Lord Our God how excellent is thy name in all the Earth David found so many different ways and reasons to worship and praise our God didn't he there's always something to to praise him thank God thank God thank God I heard a brother was finishing up and I normally don't do this well we got a few few minutes I normally would just would finish but if I know if we get out too early you know there's kind of a fine line this kind of a gray area we get out too early well well you know what we gonna do now the Baptist already beat us to the buffet so but just so just some thoughts I just it just just uh just take a minute I was listening to Terry Fox this morning I knew I wasn't having to preach and I was looking at the newspaper and listening on Terry Fox I remember Terry Fox I know brother Chad's a big fan of Terry Fox well if you heard what Terry Fox Said Today he was talking about election procrastination choosing and everything he says I submit to you congregations that's a Doctrine from the pits of hell well Terry just he fell to the bottom of my list of preachers because he was given an invitation whosoever will whosoever will and he said all the people say well God elected somebody and God chose somebody said that's the doctrine from the pit sale but you know you just you feel sorry for people like that because you have to once you deny election Jesus said John 15 16 he said you hadn't chosen me I've chosen you what are you going to do with that I said I'm the one to put your name on the last book life for the foundation of the world I'm thinking if Kane was in his in his service I wonder Esau I wonder if he could have convinced them that they could have been saved it had been hard it had been hard either boy both boys not having done good or evil God said I've chosen one I've rejected the other I've given Grace to one giving grace to the other I say this kid it helps me to appreciate it helps me to appreciate the love of God the word of God and the fact that God has chosen a sin as the brother was getting getting to in a so many directions you go now brother Banner made the statement he said he's talking about questions and answers 1964. he said uh he said you know the king and the queen how the queen will serve the king he said no wife will serve the husband by ministering him food and he said now that's the relationship we enter into now in this hour where the Queen of Heaven the bride ministers that food to her husband we got to take that word that we hear from man we take it right back to the word we find it's right it's wrong like you said examine it and so forth examine these things that we hear it if it's right we adopt it as a part of our own uh spiritual growth and we believe it and we testify it and we confess it and so forth and Minister it back to God Jesus is the one that said in Matthew chapter 18 and verse 18 He said uh how did he said he said uh whatsoever you bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven he said whatsoever you loose on Earth I'll loose in heaven he's pointing back to the man now because David said what is man it's a man who's actually crowned with honoring Glory from God so God deposits that word in his heart to what to speak it out David said I have seen therefore I have spoken see I've heard but now I see and what's the last part of that now I speak that back out and that's why we're called to be Witnesses and we testify of what God has done and that's how the word gets from generation to generation to generation to generation God established that all through the law teach it to your children and your children's children your children's children and and right on down and write on down and that's why we have it in such volume today and such Clarity today because it's continued to be to be preached bride ministering the word the husband said oh I said something in it just come fresh you said something he said but you didn't get it but there's going to people they'll be people rise up and they'll absolutely get it thinking of another statement he made on page 50 of souls in prison he said with the word comes to the prophet we know that God's ordained it he says but now now that last prophet is off the scene he said now the word comes to the individual to the bride the elect and he said they become now the word to the people yeah God's entrusting his word in human vessels in Earthen vessels where the will of God is he prayed not my will but thine be done he told us he taught us to pray in Luke 11 he said he said our father would start in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth in Earth and vessels this is where God this is the final resting place of God's word is to develop us into the very image of God himself we become living Epistles written Epistles known in red of all men amen that's a good word today I enjoyed that I enjoyed that I'll be munching on that for a while we're sheep we're of the ruminant family I mean knows what a rumored it is you see a chief always room they always ruminating or they got four stomachs see they just they eat it down it comes back up he down comes back up it's a type of meditation meditate on these things David said day and night when you get up communion with your heart meditate on these things and there's where it becomes strength because you get into that fourth stomach which is called the album you get into that fourth stomach and that's where it becomes meat actually to them not here just hearing it in the first realm and so forth and just kind of processing in our mind but when we meditate on those things meditate on those things meditate on those things that's because that's where it becomes reality that's where it becomes life to us amen whosoever sends you retain remember as Jesus blessed them and so forth at Bethany and what he tell him he said whosoever sins you retain he said they'll be retained and whoever sins you remit you remit talking to people said and also he said whatsoever if any two of you will agree or touch two or three will agree is touch anything on Earth that they shall ask he said it shall be done they that you ask shall be done of my heavenly father amen God entrusts man to deliver his word to receive his word and to preach his word to believe his word and that's what's going to change his friend that's God's order that's God's contract that's God's covenant with us today I'm so happy about that aren't you praise the Lord praise the Lord Brother Adam said the Catholic church and rising in the sun said the Catholic Church picked that up he said give it to the priest you go into that little box and you tell them all your sins and they they they they give you the old sign of the cross and and whatnot sprinkle some water onion and tell you your your sins are remitted brother said now that's carnal because they're doing it by an edict by a Doctrine by a Dogma by an order he said but the bride he said that power goes to the bride not to the Catholic sir they picked it up and stole it he said but that's the part of the Bride he said by Revelation he says the spiritual reveal revelation of the word he said that did it amen amen you know the Catholic stole the cross from us too remember brother Madam even talked about that he said you got to get he said you must be Catholic you got to cross thinking of you guys everyone said when are they on the cross they don't own it it's just a symbol anyway amen It All Belongs to us remember he was talking about Katie spartania they went over into the promised land and while they say listen you're eating he said you're eating the the milk and the grapes it belongs to us it belongs to our children but the word was go get it you got to go get it you've got to you've got to advance you've got to take it it's yours brother is it every promise and the word is yours but you got to go get it you got to rise up in faith and declare that's mine and go take it by the grace of God Amen it's free he said but you got to fight for it he said every Instagram every step of the way is a fight I know that it's a fight I've been fighting out 34 years and it's still a fight every day set yourself for a battle because it's going to be a fight as long as you stand for this word brother Madam said every devil in hell is against the revelation of this truth that God's put into your heart he don't want you to believe it he don't want you to talk about it he don't want you to minister it he don't want you to he don't want you to come to the house that God where is being preached he don't want you he's against you I hates you he knows where he's going he's trying to take as many of you there as he can he might be successful in a small group but not not the elective God friend this is what we want this is what we live for this is what encourages is what excites us amen and this is what will change our bodies amen let's all stand let's all stand your feet I do that on me a second amen now you forgive me for getting up behind you I forget the word's just good I just I just love the word amen let's just sing uh oh uh let's sing at chorus how about he Lifted Me Out do we have that one Brothers can you bring that one up he Lifted Me Out of the deep marry Kelly I thank God that he did

foot icicle to get you in heaven there he couldn't get a he couldn't get out of he couldn't get out of Hell's path himself except God would have not anoint him and revealed to him that he was on the wrong path but here we are friend we come from all walks of life and God puts us in together he says and I love one another you got the sows here you got the silk purse you got to you got the overalls
