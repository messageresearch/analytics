know we still put our trust in him and uh when you go through situations where you know you're not able to take care of yourself and when you hear some of the the prognosis is that other people had you know there was a when Dr Davis done my surgery there was a lady that had had similar accident similar surgery like I did and she had waited many months after the surgery and she didn't have nowhere near the prognosis that I did and when you hear people that you know they've lost use of their arm they have nerve damage there's just so many just a myriad of things that can go wrong and uh

operations well let's see here don't look like it's gonna I don't know where we're at Brother Anderson well it's all right I sent it to Brother Anderson so if it don't work that's all right we continue on anyway well let's all stand if it don't work it don't work thank God one of these days there won't be technology so anyway we tried this thing Brother Anderson I did I didn't tell anybody before but Brother Anderson bought me this tablet and I want to thank Brother Anderson I had an older tablet and it done a good it done a good job been a lot of places done a lot but uh brother brother Anderson bought me a new one and I have tried to use technology and technology has worked against me but that's all right we keep persevere and we'll overcome as the as the Marine motto is adapt improvise overcome so we're trying but uh tonight we're going to look at in newness of spirit Romans Romans chapter 7. begin in verse one before we read the scripture not let's just speak to the author and remember all those that have needs and so many sometimes you hear of needs and sometimes you forget all the the people that have needs because it's sometimes it seems like you know the devil's just rampaged and he just everywhere he's on the war path but it's like Lord the ones we can't remember but you you know who they are we hold up we hold up all of them the whole bride there's so many that have really need a touch from the Lord but he is the great physician he is our answer whatever he's our high priest whatever you have need of he's he's here to meet your need amen let's just all bow our heads and speak to the Lord Heavenly Father we thank you for this opportunity Lord to be in your house again Lord Lord we're just so thankful Lord for that that blood that you shed on Calvary Lord then Lord that we are able to access that Lord for all of our sins Lord our shortcomings our failures Lord Lord there's a us a healing string that still flows Lord that we can be restored amen the Lord is as the song says we can be made better than new and father we just thank you for that Lord we thank you for all the things that you've done for us Lord I think back so many years ago Lord a trial of my faith Lord but you're so gracious to me Lord almost the doctors say I've lost like three percent use of my elbow but I can't tell it but all the how wonderful it is Lord I'm able to raise my hand and testify of what you've done and Lord we see so many there's everyone in this building can can think back to a Time Lord where where it looked so hard or difficult looked impossible Lord but you come on the scene and made a way and Lord there's so many that we can think of Lord that so many Believers around the world father that need a touch from you lord lord they need an answer from you Lord whatever the needs are Lord we've heard so many Lord and we just tonight Lord we continue to lift them up Lord just continue to touch them bless them Lord Lord give them the answer that they're looking for whatever they have need of or we just commit it to you and minister in a special way to them Lord and father tonight as we look into your scripture Lord we just pray that you just come help us get ourselves out of the way Lord you come speak to us this evening Lord we commit ourselves in this service and you and to your hands in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen Romans 7. one says no you're not brethren for I speak to them that know the law how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which ath and husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loose from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from the wall so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man therefore my brethren wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God for when we were in the flesh the Motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter amen well God bless you you may be seated and I just want to look at a few things tonight and this is from the the from the message Elijah in 1953 and uh brother Brandon says let me tell you something brother America is loaded down with that Tommy rot he said we've got all they got on the programs in the radio time and everything sold as such as that because they got the sway of the world that's right he said why the Gospel of Jesus Christ ought to be preached in its power and men and women born again and come away from such stuff as that and live for God he said let me tell you something brother you say now brother Branham we're going to you're going to teaching about morals you just get that old-fashioned baptism of the Holy Ghost and you'll find out what God will do for you it says you say well I have to quit smoking brother Benham to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said listen when Springtime comes we live here in this country there's a lot of little old scrub Oaks you know it is around here it's got leaves all year round they're hanging on you know right now they'll hang on until next spring now when Springtime comes you don't have to go out and pick all the old leaves off am I just let the new life come up and the old Leaf drops off he said just get down here at the altar and stay this Tuesday until God fills your heart with the Holy Ghost and you won't have any more time for that kind of stuff you won't have to preach against it or nothing it'll take care of itself and I just want to look at a few things tonight because one of the the things here in the scripture you know Paul's writing to the to the Romans and you know he's talking about the oldness the old man the old things that were and and when he was writing about this typing it as like marriage and divorce but when he was talking about when that when the old man has passed away then you come into a newness and you don't and so when that old man is passed away when that old Union has passed away then you walk in newness of life there's an As Romans 6 tells us we walk in newness of life if we've been buried in baptism with Christ and rose again just as heroes from the dead than we raise with him then we are to raise and walk in newness of life and here here he is speaking that when that old nature when that old Union that we had has passed away then you know what we are to walk in newness of life and you know when I was speaking on in the Sunday School Sunday morning and you know um I was thinking about what brother uh I hope brother Ryan don't mind but um you know he was he had asked that question and you know when you know you begin to realize that when when God begins to deal with you when you when you see where you've come from when you know what what you were and where you come from today when you when you see you know everybody well I gotta wait to a certain point no if you realize who you are when you come because you know I was I you know I don't have I didn't you know somebody don't have to tell me that you know I had this I had this great seed in me I was a gene seed of God yes but you know what I was lost I was alienated from the life of God I was doomed and on my way to hell now anybody can everybody can try to stand up you know throw their shoulder out trying to Pat theirself on the back tell them about how great they were and who they came from and and all that kind of stuff but you know I know who I was and I knew what I needed I needed salvation I knew I needed a a whole change I I needed I needed a new birth I had I had to go through a change and something had to take place in me because I know who the old man was and you know when you when you when you come from that and you understand who you were and when you come to the place that you know there was a day and I can still remember getting down the first time brother wait I can still remember getting down on my knees and praying through because you know I told God I can't live like this anymore there come a time where you know what I was tired of the old man I'm tired of living that old thing that old way that trying to fight the old battle I'm not dealing with that anymore and because you know what because God in the grace of God had come to me and he was drawing me I didn't go looking for him he came looking for me and when he became well and he came looking for me I wanted I wanted what he had what he was offering I wanted to accept that and when I when I began to you know I couldn't but you know what there was come a day sister there come a day when when I got down and I prayed through but you know what I didn't I didn't get the relief that I was looking for I didn't get that that moment but you know I put I put my confidence in God I put my faith in with my calls that's what he told me to do he told me if I would would confess my my sins he said he is faithful and just to forgive me and to cleanse me from all unrighteousness now that's what he said I didn't do it all I had to do is take him at his word but you know what there was a day that I received a revelation that you know I realized I come to a realization that my sins were gone now you know what the devil could bring up all he wanted to and look back hey let's let's pull up all of the old pictures and all the old memories and let's go through all that but you know what thank God God don't remember that anymore all of that was as far as is in the sea of forgetfulness as the song says as far as darkness is from dawn why because all of that was gone for me I didn't have to deal but you know what I still had to battle that same old devil that same old nature was still there but praise God I did receive one thing I did know that my sins were forgiven but you know what that started me on my journey and you know what I could walk in newness of light and newness of spirit why because you know what I didn't have to worry about that now I still thought the same I still had the same desires I still thought the same Devils I still thought about those things but you know what I was starting my journey I had a journey to begin and you know what I stopped and you know the thing is is you know everybody's looking for a a Deliverance well you know what Deliverance will come but you know sometimes the problem is is we don't want we don't want to be separate from the devil we don't want to be separate from the things of the world we don't want to be separate from all the carnal things that we had that we've towed it around for so long foreign but sometimes that's what it takes you've got to you've got to put a conch make a conscious effort you've got to step forward and say listen I'm not going to there anymore you know like I was telling you with with music you know country music you know I got rid all you know I got rid of all the CDs everything that I had well because you know I was getting ready I had that that was that was my life I mean I was y'all y'all don't know how much I was I was absorbed in country music and so you know I mean Richard Richard can tell you I mean I knew I knew songwriters I knew all kinds of artists I knew I mean it was just like this I was this encyclopedia I mean I was just I was everything about it and you know it was just all I mean everything just fascinated me I just but you know time to get rid of all that you know all all the memorabilia get rid of the shirts the CDs posters you know everything that you wow you got to get rid of all that because you can't have a little bit here and a little stick it in the closet and try to hang on to it no it's time to get rid of all that you don't need you don't need any of that all that stuff from your past life's got to go 513 trash you know sell it whatever get rid of it because it because you know what you still have the desire but the thing is is you got to get rid of all that you know I had a had a friend of mine his his brother he he was such an alcoholic and you know he said he said he'd go to church and he'd pray through and he'd come home he'd throw all his alcohol away and he said well I got Deliverance and he said then next thing you know he'd be sneaking out back he'd be trying to get what he could find in the in the trash can and get it out or he's going back to the store to buy some more why and you know because it's like well I'm trying to get rid of it well that's good but you know what you got to realize I don't have Deliverance that that Devil's still there but you still got to try to get rid of that still fight that battle and you know what if you fall well you know what I never I never I just didn't start right I just I just just wasn't it just wasn't called to this because I can't overcome it but you know what if you're in if you've come to a state of justification and you be and the Lord begins to deal with you in sanctification you know you've still got a struggle you still gotta fight and if you fall down you know what you fall down and what I was thinking to that quote on the on the way to church tonight you know brother Brandon was talking about uh he says it several times but you know he says um if if I if I fail or if I sin um he said let me rise and try again he said forgive me Lord and try me one more time what you know if you fall down well then you know what it's still the grace of God that started you on your journey is this grace of God is keeping you on your journey and you know you just can't quit just because you fall down just because you because you go you have a a shortcoming hey he's on you know because it's everybody even even if you're born again you know what you're still going to cook you're still gonna fall you're still going to commit sin you're still going to have problems I know you're still going all the way this struggle you know what you still gotta fight but you know what I you know because when you start on that Journey they say well I'm not where I ought to be I'm not where I want to be well that's true but you know what praise God you're not where you used to be because you've actually started on this journey you've actually started moving forward then you can say well praise God because now you're in the fight now you're pushing forward and if you come to this place and praise God I'm gonna keep fighting I'm gonna keep fighting if I fail then you know what I'm gonna stay in the word and I'm gonna eat on the word and I'm going to continue to Feast on it until it becomes something inside of me that I can overcome with not just not just some idea but you know you still gotta fight he just you just can't give up and you keep finding in one of these days you know what it's you know because now some people have this have this to happen to them you know what everything that they all of a sudden everything goes they're just over you know and you know what some of us it's one thing at a time you know people people give up smoking and you know what or they give up drinking they can't give up smoking they have this problem and they have that problem and they're trying to get over this and they're trying to get over that but you know what it's still the work of the Holy Ghost and as you begin to all of a sudden you know what you you see the work is taking place and then when you stop to say you know what I've overcome this why because by the grace of God I've overcome well you know what you continue to overcome but you can't get you just can't stop because the devil's gonna say you thought you had that you thought you had the victory you thought you had the victory you thought you had the victory but you know what you keep fighting amen why because you're you just you just got to keep plugging and pressing forward so what have you thought out get up keep going why because you start to say well you know what devil you had me on this and I've overcome and you had me on that and I've overcome and I've had this and I've overcome you see all the things that you can't hold me back on anymore why because the Lord has brought you this far and all of a sudden you know what you realize you know what you've come to the place that you've come to sanctification well you can see the Holy Ghost has done a work in you and you begin to change but you know what you can't stop there when you've laid all these things down and you realize you know what you're feasting on the word and you realize that you've come into this place and you know you you have a desire for the word and you keep going forward but you know what you can't stop there why because the devil wants you to get to that place where you get into a lull and you think you're okay and hey I'm I'm doing pretty good well you know what that's when you become religious and that's what he wants you to do he wants you to become religious but you've not come to the place where you've actually because you've been cleaned and set aside for service but you've not been put in service you've not come to the place where you've received the Holy Ghost and if you've got to come to the place you've got to keep pressing forward until you step into that place where the Holy Ghost takes up residence in you when you become when you realize there's a place when you realize the Holy Ghost is inside of you the Holy Ghost is living in you when you come to that place well you know what that don't solve all your problems because you know what as soon as you receive the Holy Ghost tell me one person when after you receive the Holy Ghost the Devil comes and tells you you didn't get it you didn't get it you didn't get it you think you did you're a make-believer what's he gonna do you ain't got it you ain't got it he gonna fight you all the way and that's his job you know we have a very good adversary but you know what you've got to press in you've got to keep fighting you know just because just because you said well I I'm mourning it well you know now the battle really far starts now you really gotta fight on your hands you got to keep you got to keep fighting you know everybody well you know I I've reached this I've reached this stage and we got a long way to go but you just got to keep fighting that that fight the devil all the way you don't let it you don't let him have a foothold in anything you just keep going but like like brother Brown said see when you come to this place he says we you know will we uh you know will I have to give up all these things no you don't have to give up these things don't try to give it up let the Holy Ghost do the work many times you know because people they have this issue and well I don't I don't know how I'm how I'm going to overcome because the devil just beats you down sometimes and I've seen young people go through that and you know you you get so ashamed of the things that you've done and you know what you you'll allow the devil to hold you back you'll stop your progress it'll stop your journey because you're so Bound by what the devil tells you to do well you know the thing is is exposing because that's that's the only thing the devil doesn't like to be exposed and you know what and and so many people you know they they fight so many spirits and and different things in their life and they they allow the devil to stop them right there well let me let me tell you something if you if you are especially if you go to this church if you call this your home church let me tell you something I want I want you to know it from from my voice and and the amens from the from this congregation let me tell you if you've got a problem I don't care what your problem is you know what we're always behind you we're always praying for you we're always going to be be there for you there's not anybody here that thinks somebody is better than somebody else there ain't no big eyes and little use in this church let me tell you something if you think you think well I'm all alone let me tell you you ain't all alone you know what you you might you might be alone but you ain't lonely but the devil will put that in your mind that you know I I'm I'm so I'm so this and I'm so that no listen if you're if you're on your journey let me tell you something you're a child of God you know what we claim we claim everybody you know what if you're pressing the battle you know what we're pressing the battle with you all you got all you got to do is say listen I got a problem bro George you I got a problem you know what all of us have got problems but you know what none of us quit now only the only time we allow Satan to have the victories when we quit when we start to listen to the devil what he what he tells us if we sit around and just contemplate all that you know I was telling sister June Sunday it's like you know we you know he is the he's the liar and he is a father of Lies but you know what we will sit and we will listen to what he tells us and the truth is not even any but you know what we will sit down and contemplate exactly what he tells us we waste our time listening to him when he begins to talk to you know what that he's he's a liar and the truth is not in him but you know what we'll say well you know and I might be right we ain't got time for that we ain't got time for none of that get rid of all that because you know what there there's no there's no virtue in any of that there's no strength in any of that you got nothing to nope getting a time for that contemplate that cast down all of Satan's reasonings all things that he says and just look to the word this is from the message the faith of Abraham brother branham's speaking he says so when when he stepped out on God's promise he said watch what happened God said Abraham he said oh my god listen to this Abraham just look as far west as you can look just as far east north and south it's all yours it's all yours blessed are the meek Jesus said for they shall inherit the earth Abraham's seed oh my he said then Abraham he said don't just stand and look at it walk through it it's yours he said it's yours that that's why I can't understand Christians except Christ when I accepted Christ I began to dig into the Bible see what I had and look through it he said he said if somebody give me a house I'd examine every inch of it I'd go through the pantry down in the cellar up in the attic he said I'd find out what I had when I become a Christian I want to know what I got what I'm an heir to what was give to me now listen he said some of you just step in the door say uh-huh it's awful nice somebody lived back there and I bet that'd be a pretty place there it's yours every promise is yours I want to know what I got he said it's a big arcade if somebody would give me a big arcade I'd start messing around looked on every shelf see what I got he said look it over pick this up go all over the all over the way through it go all the way through it it's mine I was baptized in it so I guess it belongs to me he said I was baptized by the Holy Ghost same one that was upon Abraham baptized me into the body he said I'm heir of every one of the promises if somebody looks like looks just a little bit High if something looks just a little bit High I'd go get me a step ladder and get on it and examine it see what it looks like that's the way if Divine Healing seems to be a little out of my reach I'd get on my knees that's Jacob's Ladder and climb right up up in prayer till I could find out what it's all about see what I own it's mine it's yours it's all of you's if you believe it so if if we are children of God and we've received this by the baptism of the Holy Ghost then that's what he says then us we we see this as ours then we've received it just like Abraham Abraham by Grace Abraham received a promise he was given the promise but you know what he had to believe it and you know what he began to do he began to walk in his promise when he was a stranger when it wasn't his but God had promised it to him and he began to walk and he began to look everywhere well God told him look all around Mo Abraham look everywhere you look everywhere you see is yours all this belongs to you and he began to walk throughout all that you know what nobody else saw that but you know Abraham knew who he was and he began to walk all throughout that land and he said see if you are a child of God then you walk into that because all of that is yours and if it's been given to you because if you've come into the baptism of the Holy Ghost all of this belongs to you well then let me tell you something you know what if if God is is is if he justified you then you know what the promise in the scripture is that sanctification is yours you know what you don't have to plead and beg to come to that right why because God wants you to walk in faith God wants you to trust in him and believe you know what because that's what the scripture says because people how many times have people come to the place and you know they're seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you see and you stop and ask them well what's the first thing you've got to do what does the scripture say repent have you do you know what do you know what true repentance is have you come to the place where you've repented and it's so people people want the baptism of the Holy Ghost and they don't even know what repentance is because when you begin to speak about repentance people people are lost you know it's like you're speaking another language and see but he said if you repent and be baptized he said then he said then you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost but all of this is a promise and so you just continue to walk in that well you know what you come to this if you come through that then you know what if he if you receive this then you know the promise is unto you then when you come in there all of this is all all this all the promises and all the scriptures are mine every promise in the book is mine well then the question is are you actually going to claim it are you going to let the devil squat on your land he said you was baptized by the grace of God into this great big arcade that's got every Redemptive blessing in it everything Jesus died for is right here in the body of Christ healing salvation joy peace all these things belong to you it's yours he said let the devil say oh don't you do it don't you do it that's that old nasty Porter at the door don't you believe in that walk right on in it's yours you got to pass you got to abstract Deed on the place if sickness dwells in there you got an abstract date if you went home tonight and what if there's an enemy sitting in your your house and the enemy said now wait a minute this house is built for a human being it's mined just as much as it is your house I'm just as much human as you are you walk right down to the courts and get your abstract deed and show him this is my property it belongs to me well he said well yes but I'm just as much human As You Are he said if he won't listen you can go get the law and the law will throw him out when you serve warning on the devil that he's got that he's got his nasty camped out self on God's Property he said who yes if he don't want to get out just call on the authorities of Heaven God's law agent the Holy Ghost he will throw him out yes sir it's your property ever Divine promise in the Bible belongs to every Christian you know when you you know when you go to court and you know I was uh I spoke on that before you know when you go to court you know you don't have to go in there and plead before the judge you know when you go when you go to court and you and you have a case and you you have your attorney that goes in you know he's not up there screaming and crying and telling a sob story he says listen this person has legal standing in this court because as a as a resident of the state of Georgia and they live in a certain County or whatever and this is the law then what does he do he goes in there and tells them listen this is this person's legal standing because they have this abstract title deed they have this they have the legal right to this this is their standing and the law says so he goes back to the law and says the law says because they are a child of God and they have promised to this then he doesn't have legal standing here when you go to court when you when you were go to k to court to bring you plead your case then all you're doing is Hey listen I have a right to be here and this is the facts of the case and this is what the law says and then the judge is to to hear both sides of the argument but you know when you go in there and you show him what you've got then you know what he's supposed to answer the his verdict is supposed to because he's supposed to answer the question and his verdict is supposed to come forth and say like yes you have the legal right to this it belongs to you and he's got to go and it's the same way you don't have to plead and beg and and scream why because God wants to give you what what is yours what he's promised to you but you know the problem is is he wants us to believe him he wants us to have faith in him and trust him that it's going to take place many times you know people have you know because the devil wants us to get to a place where we just so worried and and fret and and get upset about things but you know that's that's not that's not the life of a Christian you know you just you just hold on and believe as you know in the scripture we know you you think about the the ones from the Old Testament different ones and you know you think about what they what they done Daniel there praying when that when they when the decree came the law came and said listen if you if you don't do what we tell you to do if you're not going to bow down to worship our image so we've been if you're not going to do these things and guess what we're going we've got a place for you we're gonna get rid of you there's a death sentence that hangs over your head but you know what you didn't see well Daniel up there Lord what am I going to do now yeah you know what he had he had faith in God he had a testimony that you know what it didn't matter what was going to take place he was going to trust God well he walked out there that he was going to trust God because hey y'all y'all get y'all want to kill me that's fine y'all exact your judgment they go ahead but you know I've Got Confidence in God I'm going to trust God I'm going to stand up here and I'm going to go forth and they throw up in the windows and pray and show everybody you know what I'm not afraid I've got my calls I serve a living God I serve the Living God I serve the high the all-powerful god and you know what if I die I die but you know what I'm going to steal I'm still going to trust God I'm still going to stand up and I'm still going to Proclaim that who God is and who I am he stood up there I'm going to trust God when they when they went out there to throw him in the Lion's Den you know he didn't he didn't worry about it but you know what because he put his confidence in God and he stood up for God you know what God come on the scene for him so many times when when the Devil Comes against us and he wants to try to he wants to lots of times like brother Brown said God puts things in your life things happen to see what you're going to do how are you going to handle it how are you going to respond to it so you can just get up there and see if you if you get to a place where you just well I don't know you're going to cower down say God can't trust people like that he wants to find out if you're going to if you're gonna if you're gonna go forth you know so many times we think about the the things that we we the scripture tells us about the different ones that are in the scripture you know you think about Daniel going into a lion's den and and different ones and you know how many how many people we would be standing and you know you're on a boat in the middle of a storm and I mean the the waves are crashing all around you know you can't see anything maybe maybe they felt like they were going to drown in all of the midst of all of that and here here's an all and all this storm here comes Jesus walking on the water and here that here they are coming walking you know they they the boat is about to sink they got no hopes they're going down because that was that was the devil's job he was going to sink that boat that's what he was after but Jesus come walking on the water and the rest of them were you know here they are they're already afraid because they think they're going to sink they think the boat's going to sink then they see a ghost and they start freaking out even more here they are but you know what Peter gets this idea he said Lord if that be you bid me to come well I can tell you right now that wouldn't be me you know because here you know I might be sinking in this boat but at least I got something underneath me I mean how many people you know I'm just gonna hop I'm just gonna hop out of this boat in a raging Storm but you know what there was something about Peter that when he saw Jesus he knew who Jesus was and he's like he said because he began to speak to him not to be not afraid it's I am it's me I'm here in the midst of this raging Storm and you know what and he and Peter had confidence in Jesus when he saw that he said Lord if that be you then bid me to come and he stepped hey guys said it would come and he climbed out of a out of a boat out into the raging Storm right man he wasn't he wasn't walking out on on the nice smooth Lake he's getting out in the water but you know what if he had confidence and Jesus being able to do that then you know what I can do the same thing because he spoke to me and said come he had confidence in that he could do the exact same thing he stepped out on that boat and you know what he had one way of doing it he had to keep his eyes on Jesus and if he could keep his eyes on Jesus he was able to walk he was able to do the impossible but he kept his eyes on Christ the whole time but you know what he got to the point where he got his eyes off oh then you know he got he got into he got a little maybe a little bit of lighted you know he's out there like look what I'm doing look what I'm doing then all of a sudden instead of keeping his eyes on Jesus he got into his mind and started thinking what am I standing on then he starts looking at the waves it's like I don't know if I should be here and then he starts sinking and instead of staying and thinking you know what Jesus is doing it and Jesus told me to come and if I can just keep my eyes on him and keep following the words you know I keep doing that yeah yeah and then all of a sudden when he got to the point where he got looking all around and he got afraid he started sinking and Jesus come and pulled him out of the water and said Peter why'd you doubt look you were overcoming and took him right back to the ship and got in and then he spoke to the storm and calmed the waters and the still and the storm went away see if if we have the same if we have that same faith that we can we can do the impossible he is the god of the impossible if you can if you can trust him that he is because he's the same one that called Peter when he was down on the on the Sea on the shore of Galilee and he called Peter to follow him and brought him all that way and so all of the all the faults and failures that Peter had all the problems that Peter had you know what God still kept dealing with him Jesus kept speaking to him you know he told me he said look all you know he knew what Peter was going to do he knew Peter was going to fall and have problems well you had said when he had such love for for the Lord that he was standing out there and and Jesus is telling him listen Peter just gonna be me I'm going through all this I've got to die and I'm Gonna Be Alone and nobody's going to be with me I got to bear this I got to Bear all this by myself alone Lord Lord let me tell you what I'm gonna be right there with you the whole time I'm on your sixth the whole time I got you no Peter let me tell you can you imagine when he stood there and said he said Lord you know everybody else I forsake you but I'm gonna be right there with him Peter you're going to deny me three times listen you're gonna deny me but you know what Jesus when he when he when he went through all all of that and he died and he rose again and he come back and he told Mary and them he said go tell my disciples and Peter go tell Peter that I've risen and to meet me in Jerusalem come meet me I'm coming to see you why because he wanted Peter no listen I know who you are and I know your faults and failures but you know I want you to know I still love you I still think about you why because I died for you yeah you know the one the one that he had had all of the issues with Peter had had to talk to Peter all the time he's up he's in the upper room you know as a scripture was reading the Sunday you know here he's in the upper room and he's and he's speaking to the disciples and he and he's going to wash their feet and Peter's like you ain't washing mine you know the rest of them he can wash their feet but he's the one that he's got to be contentious but listen Peter I'm doing something that you'll understand later you may not understand this right now because listen I'm just washing your feet because this is an example that I'm doing right but listen one of these days you're going to understand because well Lord wash my hands and my feet washed me all over Lord that's that time comes but I'm doing something right now that you'll understand later but but listen you're because there's coming a time you will be clean why because the Holy Ghost is coming you're going to go through that process but I'm showing you something listen now because here I am your master and Lord and I'm showing you how to be a servant but because that's that's your goal to be a servant and so when when see when later on then Peter could come back and look look at the life that Jesus lived and know I am a servant because of the things that I've seen God has brought me this place but I want you to understand what I've been through I want you to understand the grace of God because if Peter went out there and began to talk to the people he said listen he said when you come through all this Peter strengthen the brethren why because when everybody else is out of well brother Peter you know what I'm struggling I went through this and I went through that I got a story for you listen y'all want to know what Grace is I denied the Lord this is Grace you want to know what Grace is I'm all the time trying to contend with the Lord but you know what this is Grace when you want to know what Grace is just like when he calls Paul and he comes and brings Paul and Paul becomes out there and he talks about being the prisoner of the Lord and he begins to talk about being the grace of God and he begins to talk about the grace why because he's standing there talking about I've received look what I was I was a blasphemer I I was the one that that instructed people to put the Christians to death I stood there and held their coach while they were stolen Stephen and you know here this is the grace of God that he called me to preach the unsearchable riches unto the Gentiles when I was the one that was standing there watching Christians die and say but this is the grace of God Amen when you think when you think you've you're lost and you're alienated and all that I'm going to tell you what the grace of God is and say when we look at the when our lives and we say well I I've fallen but you know what there's Grace that that abounds more than you can comprehend and that's why God wants you to see there's Grace if you can see the grace of God and all the things that have taken place God knew everything that you would do all your faults all your failures all your problems God knew all of that there's nothing that's going to that that God uh was surprised about you know you know uh brother Bob always talks about me being in like genealogy so uh but you know when you think about your genealogy you know brother Graham said you know for you to get here he had to breathe you know this one come to this one and all this you know when when you think about it so if you just try to you start to think about some of this stuff sometimes if you count if you count your your parents as one generation back and then your grandparents be two generations back and your great-grandparents three if you go back 10 Generations which is your eighth great-grandparents do you know how many of your eighth great-grandparents you have if you went back 10 Generations you know how many you know how many eighth grade grandparents you have you have a thousand and 24. there was a thousand and 24 people that had to get together when you start to think about that for you to for you to be who you are today you think about when you when you go back to you go back 12 Generations I say there's I think they say there's 4096 ancestors and that in that generation over four thousand those four thousand over four thousand people had to come together and in the mind of God he knew every one of them was going to come because every one of them had to you know and you think about all of the all of the I think about my grandfather my paternal grandfather served in World War II under Patton he had one time he was he had landed on the beach they come through Sicily into France he hit the beach I was like 54 of them there's only two survived him and another man he was in the combat engineers he built Bridges the Germans bombed it twice they were rebuilding it the third time they were carrying a big steel plate that took six men to carry they got hit all five of the other men that he was carrying that plate with died he was the only one that survived he stood there and told us as kids he said you don't know what the Supernatural is he said big I can be a little kid I can still remember being a little kid sitting there and him talking about he said the angel of the Lord had to be standing in front of me he said because I could hear the bullets go in that direction in that direction but they didn't hit me when you see those type things why because you know what we had to come into existence and you think about all you know you think about all of your ancestors that traveled on boats for months all across the oceans and you think about all the ones that come from all around the world and all the things that they had to go through all of all the suffering the heartaches all of the problems and you know what all of that had to take place all the way down for you to be who you are and you're like well you know what I'm just I'm just a little insignificant blip on the screen and you know God don't know where I'm at you know what God God knew all that and he got you all the way down through here because you were one of his you come all this way to be manifested in this hour and you cut you've come to all of that all the things you you think of how all that come about for God to realize to manifest what he wanted to in this hour for you to come into existence because you are what God had in his mind and through and through the fall you know all of those all those attributes had to be displayed had to be expressed and you know what all that had to take place you know God you know sometimes we think well it's just you know like the world wants to think you know it's just like rolling the dice you know it's just just some haphazard something happened no when you start to see what God's done all this way when God what God has done all this way to bring you to this place and he's brought you to the place where he's made himself known unto you he brought you because there was a day that the word passed you away and he made itself known to you and he filled you with the Holy Ghost and he's brought you into this and he wants you to Feast on this then you know what it's a sad thing if we don't walk as the scripture says if we don't walk in newness of spirit if we don't walk in the newness of life if we don't walk a new way to walk and realize hey all this is God's done all this for me and then when we we don't realize who where God's brought us from and all the things that's taking place and then we don't have we don't have faith to heal the toothache and not realize what God's done for us that God has brought us all this way if he's If he if he does if he done all that he could do he done the very best and give give his life if he's done that then then you know what then we can accept and reap the benefits of that so this is this is from uh trying to do God a service and brother Bram says but one great thing again about God he has not left us not without knowing what's the truth and how to do it he wouldn't be just to punish us for doing something that we didn't know how it was going to be done didn't let us stumble into something he is not that kind of God he's a God that speaks the word and expects his children to believe it and therefore he knows what's best and when when to do it and how to do it he said we have our ideas of it but he knows so when when things come our way see God knows what to take place and how how it's going to take place all things are going to happen he's like well I don't know why well you know that's what the word is for the word has come to bring us to the place we know how to do it we know exactly where we are and Who We Are and so going back to the previous one when when he was talking about when you are a child of God and brothers talking about Satan being a squatter when he's squatting on your land he said you can go to court you go to court and you through the Holy Ghost he said is it God's law enforcement agent he will force him off the land he will force him out I said brother Brown says and the great thing about this is he doesn't leave us a place where we don't know how to do that because we've been given the legal right to force him out and guess what he's also given us the way to show us how to do that how you overcome well because he he's he's the same one he shows you how how to come through justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then when you get it born into the body then he shows you how to continue on then when you go up the stage of a perfect man what is him showing you how to do that when you need healing he shows you that how you go overcoming why because he's giving you the word to show you how to do that so all these things see he shows you how to do that says then if he set up a system that what he's going to do and didn't tell us what was going to happen and how it was going to happen then we stumbling at it would be justified in our stumblings and trying to do something each one but would be justified but there's one there's only one way and that is his word so he's given us the word to show us the things that we have to do and how to do it because the word will instruct you how to do the things because why because the the Holy Spirit if it's on the inside of you you desire the word then if you desire the word then you know what it's going to draw you to the word all the way through your journey he's drawing you to the word and the thing is is when you you say well Lord I don't know how to do this I got a question about this or whatever then then what is he doing he's going to draw you into the word and you're going to begin to feed on word and he'll begin to deal with you in the areas that that pertain to your life how many times have you said in the truck or the car and you go down the road you're sitting at home you think about something and you've got a question about something and all of a sudden somebody comes to church and brother Wade gets behind the pulpit and he begins to talk about something and maybe sometimes he gets off his notes and all of a sudden he's off somewhere else talking about something but all of a sudden everybody's like well why is he over there well you know what he's dealing with somebody they may be somebody listening in and all of a sudden the Lord's leading him a certain way that he begins to deal with a certain thing and all of a sudden somebody's getting their answer how many times have you come to church and all of a sudden nobody knows what's going on nobody knows what you think but all of a sudden when the when the preacher begins to speak or some brother comes up here and starts doing Sunday school or whatever all of a sudden the things that they say is right down your alley right down your line everything's like hey that's exactly for me why because God knows what you have need of and when we begin to meditate on then the Lord begins to deal with the things that we're looking for it's in the word and he begins to feed us on the word the things that we have negative so brother I'm speaking of you know growing he's talking about growing trees and you know when you plant the seed in the ground see when that when when you plant the seed talk about the word of God when the when the seed goes in the ground you just it goes in the in the ground you got to plant it and you got to water it you see when those things take place and he says see go to the the next one Brothers but he said say he said well it has to drink more than its portion it has to drink and drink so much till it pushes it out until it pushes out so you've got to you gotta take in all that you can for your situation he said it begins to push out limbs see when that seed is planted when the word of God is planted inside of you then you keep watering it you keep feeding it because then all of a sudden it's going to come forth just like brother Wade was talking about you know if you if you put a seed in the ground then you know what you need to have the right nutrients in the ground because you you can put a seed in the ground in poor soil but if you don't put any nutrients in there you can water it from now to and and it's not ever going to come it's not ever going to come up and it's not ever going to come to the fruition that it needs it never comes to its full potential why because the nutrients aren't there but see what's the reason when it comes our responsibility to prepare the ground so when the word of God Goes Forth then we can receive it that it can grow he said it pushed out limbs it pushes out leaves it pushes out apples he said it's in it but it has to keep drinking and he said in every word of God as a seed and that seed can be planted by the inexhaustible Fountain of Life which is Christ the believer has to drink Beyond his imagination drink and push out push out everything you have need of because it's in you when you receive Christ and we are planted together in Christ and he is the inexhaustible Fountain of Life and he said don't never be afraid to ask big things God wants you to ask big things he don't want you to be little petty and juvenile he wants you to ask big things that your Joys may be full and then he begins to tell the story about the fish being in the water you know in the Atlantic Ocean and worried about how much water he drinks and wonder if he's going to have enough he's going to survive because you know and talks about the uh the mouse and Egypt and the and the gardeners and wondering if we're going to have enough well we might just eat two of these we got to save up we don't know what's going to happen next and he said and he begins to talk about how how the inexhaustible the ocean was and brother I'm talking about the rat and the gardener he said if there had been ten hundred thousand rats that size they'd never be able to eat it up and how many times could we multiply you could never exhaust God in his powers and his mercies to his children he's the inexhaustible Fountain of Life just drink and drink and drink and drink this is from the from the message what does thou here and he's talking about he's talking about Elijah in the still Small Voice he said let's get that still Small Voice that somebody that something that puts the cream in the life that something that though you speak with tongues of men and angels and have not that you're nothing though you can prophesy and speak with tongues and show signs and wonders and work miracles and do great signs but if you if that still that little still small voice isn't there you're nothing says the scripture that's what we're listening for now we've had the Thunders we've had the fire we've had the rushing winds and the earthquakes but God send us the still Small Voice that's what we need and he says you can never exhaust God's love and mercy to you say well I hate to bother you so much father he wants you to bother him that way he does don't ever think that you could ever ask too much of God I believe the scriptures he said you have not because you ask not yes not because you believe not he wants us to ask and believe that our joys Joyce would be full he wants you to ask abundantly ask for big things don't limit your faith to some little mustard seed he says he says get on get on out here to some other kind of faith and move out in big things he said big things is just as easier to receive as little things you just have to believe that's all and if you've got faith just know exactly how to use it and it'll be all right you can put it right to work and it'll be fine and he said could you imagine talking about exhausting God's love and Power and beneficiaries for you could you imagine the little bitty fish a long way talk about that little fish again been up there in the middle of the ocean he said I better consider this thing a better drink of this water sparingly because I might run out someday a little fish about that big in the middle of the ocean he said well that could easily be done more easier than you could ask too much of God he's the inexhaustible Fountain of Life whatever you have need of ask him and believe it he provided it in the Redemptive blessings when he died at Calvary and gave a promise to you for everything you have you have need of while you're in the journey it's yours and you'll uh if you'll ask can believe that's right and he begins to talk about that little mouse again said when he talks about being that that little mouse down there and he says see that's the way people act as Christians get up of a morning God bless my family today and keep us Close to You amen well I've done my religion for the day oh I just like to lay down really and drink don't you and just get a real spiritual gastronomical Jubilee and just drink till you just can't drink no more just continue to drink and this is from the message why do us thou here and I wanted to get to this he begins to talk about that still small voice again see if we get back to that still Small Voice that he spoke to us about and he that's the state because it's the same voice that started you on your Journeys the same voice that'll speak to you all the way through and it's the same voice and he because he's talking about you know if you see these things and understand God wants you to ask big things don't ask for just little things but the big things and he said see big think great things are quiet things all right did you know that friends listen the son now listen this the sun which gives life on the earth to every little living thing and body life plant life tree life and whatever it brings forth life the sun does and he says and it can draw a million gallons of water from the earth and make less noise than we can get a bucket full of out of a pump say it's big things Quiet Things are big things did you ever hear the world turning did you ever hear the parent the planets as they pass through the orbit did you ever hear one that's the big things did you ever hear the sun rise when we began to look at the big things see God wants us to ask for the big things if you have if you have a need I don't care how big it is God wants you to ask you know brother Brown said God has a you know God has a problem with you not asking when you're a child of his and you have a need and you don't ask him and you don't pour your heart out to God then God has a problem with that and when you can't say Lord I'm gonna put my trust in you no matter what I put my trust in I got my confidence in you amen and you know the thing is is when God's on the same God does Miracles and you know what you never see it you know because God wants you to ask you know I tell everybody all the time I had I had when I worked for heating and air company before a work what I do now you know we lost the keys to the truck everybody's heard that story about you know we lost the truck keys and man let me tell you what we went high and low and everywhere looking for him we had to have those keys for that truck we got one set of keys and they were gone we went through the dumpster and everything else we went looking everywhere because when I drove the van back to the shop I backed it in the parking place and I usually carried the keys into the shop and I laid them on the desk in there so if anybody needed them they could get in there man those keys were gone it's like we need those keys me and a buddy of mine we was digging through everything praying and looking and we couldn't find them and I went home and you know I was praying Lord I don't know where those keys are I don't know where they're at and I like we need those keys Lord and I prayed and prayed and I went to bed and I didn't sleep very good that night but I in the midst of that that night I had a dream and brother Ron Spencer come to me in a dream and I and I as soon as I saw brother Ron I told him to brother Ron I don't know where those keys are we need them and brother Ron said don't worry brother Aaron the Lord knows where they're at he'll take care of it you know brother Ron he's he he's he's never lost for you know he's always positive it don't matter what's going on I ain't never seen brother brother Ron down or whatever and you know he he come don't you worry the Lord will take care of he knows where those keys are but I went to work the next day and you know we had a little barbecue grill out beside the right out beside the door the shop door and we had the trash cans and had a barbecue grill like sometimes we cooked on and I was heading into the shop and my boss come by and he said we found the keys really yeah he said they were laying on top of that black barbecue grill when I got up this morning when I got here this morning I had a set of black cart you know I don't have my keys with me but anyway we had a a door opener the remote and had keys and it had an orange number one about that big on the keychain that was all that was on there sitting on top of a solid black barbecue grill and we walked in now that door multiple times and that orange number one was laying on top that's the first thing he saw that orange number one laying on top of that barbecue grill we walked high and low we worked everywhere but you know what the Lord told me not to worry I don't know how it got there it's not my job to know but I know the Lord put them there I don't know where they come from but you know what the next morning they were there when I got when I got laid off from that job I was sitting at home in front of the computer we was getting ready to go to the fellowship meeting at brother homers and I was sitting there and I'm thinking what am I going to do and I and while I was sitting there starting to have my little pity party the Lord come by and told me he said you know who's preaching the fellowship meeting today and it oh wow brother Ron Spencer is preaching and brother in Alabama at brother Homer's and so when I went down there I told brother I was telling brother Ron after church you know that you know it's like I was talking about that key and he told me he said listen he's brother don't you worry he said you just believe he said I'll pray well as of July the 23rd the last so this past July the 23rd of July I've been where I'm at right now for 10

been here longer and we've had our we've had our resumes in we haven't heard anything how did you hear and I went in there and I told him I said it's not what you know it's who you know because you know what every good and perfect thing comes from the Lord and if you have a need if you have if you have a desire in your heart then he's here to meet your desire he said he said but the problem is he said we don't ask because we don't believe you have not because you have stunned he said yes because you don't believe but if we can just believe let's all stand only believe only being believed

cancer and we had a almost a five hour service some of you ought to watch it online brother Joe said he watched it online a man with stage four cancer taking 30 chemo pills a day and as hard as he preached and he had we had prayer line for almost two hours hour and some and he preached for an hour and something and he just kept right on going stage four stage four cancer brain lungs all that you know so that's what he's facing but you know what we serve a bigger God we serve a God just way bigger than any of that cancer is Never Scared To God not one second not one Split Second has never bothered him one bet but we want the devil to be bothered that's right amen so let's remember that be here at six o'clock on Saturday and then we'll have one service on Sunday so let's bow our heads
