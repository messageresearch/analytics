us amen for the doctors we thank God for it and we just pray that the Lord would bless so call him and encourage him and I'm sure that it would help him amen all right Revelations 1 I hope you're beginning to pick up on the point of reading so much from Revelations 1 that to see that this is the picture of Jesus Christ down through time and the doings you know and all of these things and uh that's what we're we're trying our best to get you to see what's going on you know here in our part of the book verse 12 and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about to pouch with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like a Define brce as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters all right let's go over to First Peter and pick up which will be bringing our thought for tonight basically so we'll begin with Verse 18 for as much as you know that we were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation that means your conduct your manner of Life received by tradition from your fathers but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot who verely was for ordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you who by him do believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your Faith and Hope might be in God seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfined love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently what now being bornn again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever job says I know my redeemer liveth because he had a positive attitude you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now I really enjoyed these brothers taking over and and doing the Wednesday services and things and really enjoyed them really enjoyed Wade's message or Sunday and he told me going up the road to hold off on what I was saying because I started talking about something and found out that's what he was going to preach on so uh you know we'll get around to our part of it later but the point that he was making Sunday was really a great thing you know it takes the blowing of the wind across your vocal cords to create words right amen you don't it's got to move that a across that vocal cord to make the word prede from your lips well see then we we'll get around to it where when he said let there be light we'll see more of what we're talking about all right but I want to make sure you follow me in the message Sunday afternoon I just kind of had to skip across and didn't give a lot of the quotes but I want to talk tonight about a positive attitude all right we'll get to that part when we get around to it and if you will by this coming Sunday maybe Wednesday but I'm sure this maybe this Sunday afternoon I wish you would listen or read the message who is this mzc because it will be very valuable in the next uh a couple of messages maybe after the morning service especially it will be very needful and notice in there the things that brother brandham shows the difference between Jesus Christ and you and I right and how everything comes into being so then that'll that will help to to understand but if you will listen to that by then you know but now what have we come down to talking about what is the new birth brother brandom Christ The Mystery of God revealed he said it's a revelation personally to you of Jesus Christ amen right now has God revealed to you and you say well it's so hard to get a revelation remember there's a quote in the Christ of mystery I've got it in here but brother brandham says that even the most most illiterate person can receive the new birth amen right so then it's not a head knowledge great thing that we think about as a revelation trying to be something like that it can be very very simple you know I've even expressed myself as to say like this that you know people always wonder well what is the seventh seal well make it a very simple thing I thought the prophet said it was the coming of the Lord right well what would he say in his coming they very simple I'm here right is that too simple you know you always talk about me being s deep to me that's the way I think you know in other words I say to you come to my house well when you arrive you're there that's right well that's very simple but see that's what it is in the new birth then it doesn't take a great big head knowledge with this lengthy Revelation to be able to say you got the new birth right but it takes a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you amen all right then we gave the quotes from The Prophet there where he's talking about he said you can only be saved by revelation see then there's no way of being saved without a revelation right amen you said well I I got saved and well you heard somebody speak didn't you did God speak to your heart right well then it's not a great big mystery of the Seven Seals has got to be understood before you get the new birth and you got to know all about the vows and the plagues and the trumpets and all of the things no right it's a revelation of Jesus Christ amen personally to you right and you know what Martin Luther receiv received the josu shall live by faith and that was a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to him and he went forth and conquered a world of unbelief with that simple message that J shall live by faith so then when I'm talking about something like that saying that it's something that he's got to reveal himself to you I'm not talking about that you had to be in this message to receive the new birth I believe right over there across the street at that little non-denominational church I believe God could come down tonight and save somebody's Soul now that's contrary to most people but still remember now it still got to be that the word got to be planted amen but what's the planning of the word it's not the seals of plagues of vs of trun it's telling you about Jesus Christ and his love for you and how he died for you right that's how simple it can be but no matter what it's a revelation of Jesus Christ right cuz remember how we were trying to bring out and Jesus Christ is the word amen so it's the word revealed so there's never been a person saved that didn't hear the word of God first that's right amen it's impossible because you heard it from somebody you read the Bible you you know you heard a tape you heard somebody speaking to you Grandma talking to you you know Daddy talk Mama talking to you or something it had to be that Faith cometh by hearing amen and hearing then comes by the word of God all right right see because you'll see then like I'm saying that when you come to that point then that our breathing across those vocal cords creates words amen all right and brings it to forth to until the ear can hear what is being said all right but see it takes a revelation then this is not just coming to church and and just being good we we've tried to go through those things to try to help to show that you can be ever bit of that and still be lost well I didn't know it was a revelation well well what now you do so okay we'll leave it that way you do now so you're responsible for it but have you ever prayed for a revelation have you ever asked God to reveal himself to you it can be a simple thing that he could wake you up in the middle of the night and speak to you and you accept that could bring eternal life amen we see we want to get on to all of the others like well you know like I said I emphasized it a lot you say what about the New Birth what you well I spoke in tongues I shouted I cried that's not what I'm talking about no right amen the disciples had spent three and a half years with all kind of signs and wonders taking place at their own hands let alone being witnesses to the things of the Lord Jesus am and that didn't save one of them right right right see then you say but yet you're doing away with everything I've got well if I can do away with everything you got then you ain't got nothing is that a good way of saying it might be bad language but it's truth amen that's right but do you can you say God has revealed himself to me and see then you'll never have to worry about it amen cuz they can't deprogram you they can't take it away from you if he's revealed it to you now if it ain't revealed to you you don't have to worry about nobody taking it away from you cuz you lost it anyway intellect head knowledge is wonderful we must have it right before we can have the new birth all right right but head knowledge is not that birth that's right amen it's not how much you can read or understand or quote or whatever is what's been revealed to you Satan can't fight a revelation but you can only be saved by revelation well I mean if if that tires up your doctrines and ideas I want you to show me where the Prophet taught something different or the Bible does it cuz remember Sunday what we were trying to bring out every person that has ever been born again is born again the same way right amen all natural normal babies are birthed the same way water blood and spirit and life you know all new births are the same yeah but but but I I I just can't see that because looking back down there and seeing them other people looking at what they each one had a revelation of Jesus Christ for their age and their time that's right a revelation something God has revealed to you personally to you well Amen brother Dale you've just blowed everything I had because I based it on this that or the other well where can you put what you're talking about in the word I see it right if you can put what you're talking about in the word If It's Shouting speaking in tongue crying I've preached that hard and hard hard and hard hard trying to get you to see it I believe in every bit of that I believe in the manifestation of the spirit of God I believe in many many things that God does I believe that when children are born they will be children and act like children and cry I believe that amen I just don't believe that those are the things then we found out what was the evidence of the Holy Ghost right well you go out to the world and ask them what's the evidence of the Holy Ghost I cried I spoke in tongu I shout when the prophet of God says that the evidence was the same in every age that's right amen because the birth was the sign right what is the evidence to do then it's whether or not the spirit and you can agree with the word continually agrees with the word now you'll agree with a certain part yeah but I mean keeps on agreeing right all right even the prophet himself thinking that it was love you remember we gave it Sunday off a broken sister where he said that the Lord come down in a vision and straightened him out and said it has to do with receiving the word we see that way then everybody's got the same evidence everybody's got the same birth birth now there's stages of developments and things in the birth yes because we'll get to that after a while going through but the new birth is the new birth it's the birth of the word it's the word you heard amen quickened un you amen Made Alive where you can can say I see a personal revelation always has a positive attitude all right now you see job he said I know that's right all right now I wrote it in my Bible right in there 19 and 23 right there I wrote it in my Bible years ago like this job had a revelation he said I know my redeemer liveth all right now he not maybe not seeing what we would think he would see as going down to Calvary or whatever uh that's all right if he saw every bit of it to the detail but it's all right if he didn't because the vision was to him that he saw a vision that's right all right his three Buddies were probably good guys right probably real good people you know they were doing their best to convince job you must have goofed up somewhere and job said I didn't do it I didn't do it and they kept on they loved him they wanted to help him but you know what was the difference job had a vision they had a head knowledge right right their head knowledge would agree to an end of the world because even irregardless of the Pharisees and the Sadducees they say the sagues don't believe in the resurrection well now I I differ with you on that point I believe that they believe in a final Resurrection whereas the Pharisees was believing in a resurrection up you know coming true but those you don't do you think those Sadducees well ain't no Resurrection you're dead you're dead well why you going to believe in God for right come on they were Believers of God they were fighting for the word of God they just didn't believe in a right then Resurrection see because job said I know my redeemer liveth and when in the last days he'll stand upon the Earth amen and I'll see him paraphrasing in our language right I'll see him for myself that's right amen amen see he was standing looking at that what do you think the other guys were doing well that's right job we we believe yeah we believe it we believe that there we believe there'll be a but we just don't put it all in what you're saying so what did they wind up with hope that's right now what do we how tonight do we have hope or faith that's right that's right now job said I know brother BR said he had a positive attitude so I ain't worried about that cuz I I believe he did that word I know there is not just I think or I hope he said I know my redeemer liveth all right now but to others what about a hope now there is hope in the Bible terminologies that is the same word is Faith right but there's hope in the Bible terminologies of words that is just a mental conception now which one you got what have you got what what's your thoughts brother Joe gave me this he didn't know I was going to speak on this but he just looked at the notes and said positive attitude so he he just ran me off one if they can pull this one up and just go ahead and pull up uh Faith cometh by hearing brother around preached in 1954 4 uh 3:20 we go down to e26 well look then in the 10th chapter say we find him trying trying him now dividing what faith is now Faith is Burly my hope I like to think of faith hope faith and hope faith and charity all right now and look and hope what a beautiful thing hope is little timid lovely and sweet as she is yet she's the greatest enemy faith has yes sir now he's not talking about the hope that is an anchor of the Soul right cu the hope that is an anchor of the soul is Faith that's it but it's just hope do we have an anchor of the Soul we just have a hope look what he says she's the greatest enemy faith has y that's right the greatest enemy fa God is Hope because a person becomes so hopeful till they leave away from Faith that's getting pretty strong is't it that requires you think a little bit doesn't it all right watch now hope will agree with the Bible hope will say it's true hope will say I believe every bit of it I believe that that's the word of God and I believe that God will keep his promise hope believes all of that but hope then says now I believe that God will heal right but look at my condition y so do we have hope or a hope that's an anchor of the Soul which is Faith see because you got hope faith and charity if you don't put them together you're going to run out think of that do you understand the difference right amen there is a hope that is an anchor of the Soul which is fine to believe in his faith and you don't have to worry about it right right but then there's a hope that's just yeah I hope that's right I believe it I believe God's word now doesn't now will you agree with me most of us fit in that last part of that category right what about it no I've got faith well like brother R said now he said what are you doing in the pray L that's right if you got faith that's right Y what are you doing coming back to the prayer line right over and over if you got faith amen y but see we think of Hope see we get it all confused we can have what you would call A human positive attitude best way I could say it because it's not Holy Ghost attitude if it's hope that's a holy ghost it will be the anchor of the Soul it will be Faith which is a revealed word of God but what about a positive attitude see a lot of times we think it's pretty positive don't we we believe God's word we believe what he says well why doesn't it produce now we start you know what we start doing we start propping it up right one of our great proper uppers right is to say well the Lord just trying my faith to see if I'll hold on now I didn't know he had to try it to see whether he we would hold on on or not I thought he knew whether we would hold on or not I I kind of had that in my idea is that the way you think he don't have to worry about it amen that's right but you see we can have a hope and it not be and it could be a great wonderful thing but it's not a positive attitude do we have a positive attitude about God's word that's right at least we ought to say one thing this is at least my way of saying it I believe the word's right right whether or not I can produce it or what it can happen I still believe it's right I believe what God Said is true and Lord help me doubt my doubts you know to get me to the place all right so then what is the new birth it's a personal revelation to you that's not just a hope right it's a revelation CU there's a lot of difference in a revelation and a hope now maybe I quote it over again from him we can use that word hope and say I believe the word of God I believe the Bible to be true I believe God's A Healer but my case is different now that's pretty shallow isn't it may I quote the prophet that's about as shallow as a soup made off a shadow of a chicken and starve to death you think I'm rough in what I say you ought to listen to him a lot but do you understand what I'm getting at if we have a personal revelation then that personal revelation gives us a positive at attitude that's right amen why do you think I preach the way I do but have not afraid to put it on the internet worldwide if I had a hope I sure wouldn't be putting it on the internet cuz somebody going to tackle you but see if I've got a faith then I don't worry about it amen because it's anchored amen all right hope can bring me to a faith but hope is not Faith right right see if that's all you got hold on to it don't lose it I've never tried to dechristianize anybody to tell anybody say well well you're lost no you're going to determine yourself whether you're lost or not not me cuz I'm not going to get into that cuz I don't have no business in that that's not far me that's between you and God it's when you and the Lord to decide whether or not you're right amen all right and see that way then it's not a head knowledge a revelation is not a head knowledge no that's right right you can only know God I gave you the or this par phrased a little bit of it Sunday and didn't read them look the only way you can know God is by faith yes sir the only way you can know God is by faith to know him is life not to know about the word nor the letter of the word but to know him is life so you can only know him by the word for he is the word it's the only way you can know him right see as the natural we trying to bring out Sunday as the natural baby requires first the the planting of the seed so does the spiritual birth require that right and you can't be born again without having faith am and you can't understand god without the new birth right right you've got to be born again or you'll never understand God that's taken from the message expectation but do we have a revelation have we had as trying to get out a personal experience with Jesus Christ right or is it just Mom and Daddy's in church I'm in church Mom and Daddy wouldn't be here I probably wouldn't be here either is that the way we are are we living off with somebody else experience that's right think about that are we living off of brother bram's experience I used to have a brother in this message he's passed on now but I mean he talked to me once a week or twice about doctrines of the message and and we Fellowship together like everything and I preached a simple message one day about something and I said this is my Revelation I had an open pull pit to preach there anytime I desired I just had to all I had to do is walk in he sent word by another brother to tell brother Dale that he wasn't going to preach in his church no more because this was his words I got a revelation that brother brandham is the only ones that got a revelation you a statement right I said I had a revelation about what brother R said he said he had a revelation that he didn't have a revelation well those words are the same to me I said I had a revelation he said he had a revelation but his Revelation was only what brother Brown said well I hope that's all mine's ever been based on at least I try because I believe the word of God Amen but see you don't know God by education but God's known by faith amen and the only way you can know him is by Faith by Revelation amen see that's what we think about faith we talk about faith and what is Faith Prophet said it's Revelation right all right now we think listen we think it's believing God's word now listen we think faith is believing God's word well what if God's word has been incorrectly taught to you right now you tell me it's faith if the word is incorrectly taught right so you get in trouble when you're facing it correctly but see faith is a revelation and I thought the Bible said the Lord Jesus Christ said it Upon This Rock This Revelation I'll build my church amen right I thought it was the whole church was based on the revelation of Jesus Christ right that's what I thought I thought as I read this Bible and do as a Prophet said if I don't see Christ in every verse I need to read it again cuz I've missed something but we look in there to try to find ourselves or find somebody else to read and we can take this one to put it over here and what is it let's see uh John 666 boy that's that's a great Revelation and that's really something that's a great Revelation about the Antichrist well I didn't know the Antichrist could be revealed I thought it was Jesus Christ being revealed and you've seen the Antichrist and going in an opposite direction I thought that was the secret of the message in the last days that you cannot reveal the Antichrist you reveal Jesus Christ and you see the Antichrist in opposition but you see that's where we put it instead of having it then no wonder we don't have a positive attitude because we're up and down with it job said I know brother R said that was a positive attitude right amen a positive attitude had been revealed to him Abel knew that he was born in his mother's blood from his father's blood that was a revelation unto him and that was called Abel's Faith Abraham believed God right am and that was his faith that he believed in what about your faith could it be put to a test what about what you believe we need somebody to come along and really jog it to see whether not we whether it's Faith or whether we just have hope or a thought right of course we've always got now we've always got a cop out right brother brandham says for me to not talk Doctrine but to take it to my pastor or my husband and probably 90% of the women in this message wouldn't wouldn't even try to take it back to their husband cuz they they probably know more than he does how would you like it to somebody talking to you and you say well I'll let my husband talk to you that's good that's wonderful that's a quote but you know where the Prophet said that it wound up with a problem you mean to tell me you can't witness sisters and you know witnessing you're going to have to say some things right if you're witnessing to somebody you're going to have to say some things you know you're going to have to say hey we believe in one true and living God well then there's where the Trouble Comes see the preacher or somebody says to you we say explain it so I can't maybe explain it to you and that's to what I believe but I believe in one true and living God and I'll give you the best simple illustration I can give you but then we'll stop it that what's wrong with that I thought you used to have a witness I thought that Aquilla Priscilla one of them was or right and they were convincing other people right but do you understand what I'm talking about do you actually have a positive attitude to where that you're not worried about what somebody has to say are you concerned that you could be wrong well if you are you probably need to check it you might find out if you are God if you think it wrong why would you be thinking that right well this is the way I see it well that could be good now but remember it's something personal you don't hear me arguing with people and say this is the way I see it I said let's get down into the word of God and see what the word of God has to say about this right why because I don't mind my faith being put to the test it's really good for you amen it's good for you to be put to the test it's good to find out what you believe you know right you might find out you believe more than what you think you know but what about it what about a positive attitude now these are a couple of thoughts and I know I think ain't crazy but brother brandom on God's chosen place of worship says you cannot be a negative without a positive now Aaron back is an electrician he'd probably show me the theories of things but I ain't interested in electrical theories I'm interested in the word of God you there cannot be a negative without a positive which one comes first now he knows electrically speaking that the negative is there what we need is the positive I mean you you don't have to create negativity right right it's just there all right and see then what you do is you take and I I've not done but I've done a little bit of wiring but you you can just you can take an electrical wire with 10,000 currents on it and as long as you're not grounded you can hold that wire now I may be wrong in my theory of whatever is what these is called is and that's called that but it just plain sense if there's not something to make that grounded it won't kill you won't hurt you at all why the prophet said this room is full of electricity right y really what did they do Aaron they were really wound up of a way to find out how to make it NE to to ground it but the positive was first now God has always been positive all right now I know brother brandom and what he says about it and I agree with what the way he uses it cuz he'll say from negative to positive and a lot of people argue that in the message and say you can't have that well I differ with you brother R said you can go from negative to positive I believe that because we start off as we're totally negative every individual every person is totally negative all right it takes the word of God to to make a point there for something be anchored too that's what I've been talking about the New Birth the word planted within you is wonderful but if the Holy Spirit doesn't come to Quicken that there is no new birth that's right amen I don't care how much words you got there's no New Birth without that being quickened by the Holy Ghost all right but you see the negative didn't come first the positive came first cuz the positive was almighty God right all right now if you take it in that order of thinking about it see then the prophet says it on my kinsman redeemer there's no more negative it's all positive amen see now when we realize that we're not worried about you know cuz you ain't talking about electric lights whether they work or not you're talking about faith that will take us out of this world so I don't want nothing negative all right I told you now I know where brother Rand said it I can quote okay I know where he use it he'll say from negative to positive because they argued that way back 20 40 50 years ago that they didn't agree with that I Agreed 100% with it because he wasn't saying negative to positive he was saying partial to perfect right because you can take it from partial to perfect you know that everything thing starts partial your new birth starts at a partial because you take justification sanctification those are both a partial right so then instead of it being negative to positive it's from partial to perfect that's the best answer all right see then that way energy can I must wrong tell me energy cannot be NE neither created nor destroyed that's right you know that energy cannot be created nor destroyed you only learn how to use it harness it bringing it into the bases of finding where to put the ground wire right right that's right but see in energy cannot be created cuz energy is God you never talked to people about the Big Bang Theory you know I mean they're Big Bang on on the evolution not the big bang of you know see there their idea of it is that somewhere this thing got started because of something that was real and that's why I don't understand when you're talking to somebody that says oh we just come down from this and we come from that we'll just ask them to go on backwards if they're going to say anything is real then you're going to have to say there's a God if you're going to say energy is real then you got to agree that there's a God but listen this is my point now everything goes from partial realization to perfect realiz Iz ation but now remember as I'm trying to get to point for the message tonight of a positive attitude remember one thing the most negative part of the word of God may I say it that way is the most positive thing that could ever be the most negative part you could think about God's word is the most positive thing that could ever be cuz you're dealing with his word amen amen amen you ain't dealing with thoughts and ideas and knowledge and how to do this and how to do that you're dealing with whether or not it's been revealed to you so the smallest Revelation that's it now use that word because I what I don't how the education express it good enough but the smallest Revelation you could think of that ever been revealed to you you know that that's more positive and all the things the devil's got in his AR everything the devil's got on his side of the story is put out by a little Revelation a room can be so dark until as the old saying goes you you stick your finger out pull it back find a hole it's so dark that you can't see nothing but you strike one match amen right it puts out every bit of that Darkness amen that's what a revelation is what's the problem when God reveals it to you when he reveals it to you it may be the most negative thought that could ever be but it would be in God the most positive thing above everything in the world because it's a positive attitude and we got to get away from the negative see get away from the negative amen that's why I believe like I do and I've always tried to teach it to you and you say well how is this and how is that you know right today that in the body of Christ there are people that are that are at each one of these levels of the stature of a perfect man that's right is that true but does this one up here say I don't need you down there no you're based upon that Faith that's why I've always try to defend it even great people and say well they can't preach era the man said zeusa Street Pentecost was false now you tell me Theus Street Pentecost was false I'm going to tell you your f fault amen because that was the move of God for the hour amen well see that was the most that was a partial realization we agree Martin Luther in his message of the just shall live by faith sure in comparison to the day and the hour that we're living and the word has been brought to our understanding it was a partial realization going to a perfect you ever noticed this with the prophet he said your soul is not complete now how many knows what the rest of the statement is he say you only have the earnest of your inheritance that's what the Bible says that's right the most negative thought we could think of in God would be the most positive thing compared to the world Amen then could be so when you receive the new birth you get the earnest of your inheritance that's what the Bible says hey that's why you know what I say a lot of things you know but do you think about it then it don't matter how old you are and how much knowledge you got the day you receive the new birth you a baby that desires the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby a baby why the Bible says what don't put a novice in charge right brother around said is there in The Honky Tonk praying playing music and singing to serve the devil he said next night they're preaching in the pull pit well who are you you going to tell that person that they're not supposed to be preaching I'm going to tell them say what you need to do is you need to get a bottle and a pacifier and go sit down cuz you going to preach the same old devil you were singing to the night before cuz you don't know nothing about God cuz it don't come in one whack you say would you tell somebody that sure I sure would remember I'm the guy that you say would you cast a stone at somebody that does wrong hey I got to pick up the Rock and throw it I'm the pastor I don't want to but I got to tell it like it is you don't put a novice in the pull pit right we've done it a many of times in what has it done to a lot of people that's right blowed their head so big right that's right what did I tell Wade when he come and told me that he believe the Lord called him to preach I said run run run run run that's right I said you run until he runs you down son and I'm talking to a guy that at 12 years old could quote most of the preachers to death in this message and I will not back off one word because I've been there and seen a man had had the knowledge of this message they would come to me and he said Daddy why do I think this I said because it's the truth son he said well where did I get it I said all of that knowledge you've had over all of these years that you studied the message back in those years but see my point to him run run sit down listen listen amen get it anchored within you to where then it's not just you saying well brother random said this or daddy said this it's whether or not you have a revelation amen you you can't put it on that right am see see in this day we are to come to perfect realization all right that's right you say well what's going to cause the Rapture to come brother Dale and the things what do you look at to say uh the only thing I can say is what the prophet says when it comes to perfect realization that's right right right well see then that would require that the word opened from partial to perfect if you want to use the word negative to positive as long as you're talking like that you're all right amen right but just remember there's nothing negative in God the most negative part of God is is more positive than all the things the devil's got amen right that's right what is the new birth it's the birth of the word that's right but you know what we spend a lot of times talking and people do a lot of things and leave out a lot but you know what my wife will agree with you on this my belly is still getting bigger so I must be growing right and you know how I'm growing by eating right right by eating right so it's evidently that the natural person never stops I told Brother Lor one time I hope you don't mind if he hears this he's always laughed at it but I've seen him on dots and he go up and down and up and down I said brother Lor in the time I've known you you've gained and lost over a th000 pound and that's true yeah right but if the natural is true how do you grow in the spiritual right you take a baby and you get it started and then you just stop it and don't give it no more milk what does it do it'll die but you let it grow until one day comes that it doesn't need milk as much it still uses that but you can start feeding it a little food you take a c these teren and what Zachs learned a lot about that you take a baby CF and and you you take it off the mama if you lose it or something and and you give it milk but you think well boy next week I inan tomorrow I'll just I'll just throw him a bunch of hay out there well first off probably wouldn't eat very much but second all it's got about four different stomachs and that first stomach takes 21 days I think they say for it to develop into a stage to where other things could be at well you know God's good at that you know he don't require all of us to be the same level because he knows we're not he deals with us according to our abilities all right thinking about it perfect partial realization comparing to perfect realization and bringing it to a positive attitude now I know this thought doesn't maybe ring with you but you know I've said it so it's not the first time of saying it you know I've always said that the way I check a Doctrine from anybody is how by my new birth I I check them by the prophet I check them by the Bible Well I you know I I think that's what I meaning but that's all right you go ahead that's just like the old Pentecostal they shake each other's hand look in the eye you know I'm Discerning your spirit well you know what it was two Devils looking at each other probably but you see I remember how I was born again right and you know somebody starts talking about being born again they'll say you know well not born again come forth speaking in tongues well that's all right if they've got that in the right order that's right but if they're saying their birth is them coming forth speaking in tongues see now you're making it the evidence of the Holy Ghost and you're off the word right amen well what about it what do you think about the word of God see the word of God I've been studying now since back in the Baptist which would have been about 60 something roughly 60 and you know I still believe the same thing and that is that the word of God never stops growing it never never stops unfolding amen it never stops being revealed amen you get something down here that's revealed to you and then you get something over here that's revealed to you and it's contrary somewhere you missed it one of them's wrong that's right probably both of them's wrong but at least we know one of them is if it's contrary see that's why when I come into this message then I was asked a question in the Bible study one night what I put it on of what has kept me and what I put that on is one thing my love and my desire to know about Jesus Christ and knowing that this message is the way Christ is going to come to us or else we didn't need a prophet right but if we agree we needed one then that's the way it's going to come see then it's always been a NeverEnding Revelation am I don't believe Revelation ends that's right I believe we're just getting enough here to when we get dire to be able to comprehend what's going on there that may be a carnal way of saying it but I just believe that we're just getting enough of the word of God to understand God's word enough to talk to him when we get there without all of these carnalities that we have I've always taught you that right see it never stops unveiling but you see people nowadays that they're just changing every which way and they and they went with a message for 40 years and then brother random now's wrong well if he's wrong now he's wrong 40 years ago but what was the problem you living in a world of hope you hoping for something to be right you wasn't living in a world of Faith you're dealing totally in Hope but see Faith can't end how can a revelation be exhausted about partial to Perfect come on you receive the new birth that is perfect but it's not the Perfection that's required up here right you receive the new birth that's partial realization of what this is up here right but just remember it can't change now you can't have how this down here being a revelation of one true and living God and like they are in the message today would Jesus just the Son of God now that's not partial to perfect that's partial back in pice negative how can you do that can you stand and say that after all of these years in the message that it's greater and greater every day that I live to see him unfold himself to see God revealing himself to you and I amen and you know what he'll reveal to you that he was a baby one time right is that the scripture that pretty well does away with most all them doctrines because where they say you know Jesus wasn't God to the River Jordan according to the Bible it says he he was born Lord the Christ so that's enough to settle that you shouldn't come up with something else some garbage can after then to be able to try to turn that around we want another garbage we have another Trinity right but think about it do you have a positive attitude about what you believe amen you see this is the way that it's always been to me the reason I love it I hear brother randam say things one day and man it just sounds like it just it just don't fit he said I can conclusively prove that you're born again and then baptized into the body when I heard that and I remember the biggest portion of people that heard that too about that time in the late 60s that they was really fighting about those things and trying to figure out what he was talking about but you know when I get something like that I just leave it alone I don't quit studying on it or anything or thinking on it I just leave it alone I don't try to figure it out right amen I wait on him to tell me right and then one day I'll find it where the Prophet says it like this he says you're born again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said but the Holy Ghost then baptizes you into the body for the gifts right now the quotes right what you been fighting over to try to figure out for a long time the quote right wait on him he'll give it to you yeah but we don't have time to wait why you been around let me quote R mo one man said he said something to a man one day about Statue of perfect man the man said I'd like to listen to them brother Mo said good I preached 69 I think it was 69 sermons it was something like that he said I preached about 69 sermons on it brother looked at him he said I ain't got time to listen the 69 sermon he said you've been goofing off all the rest of the time and ain't got it he was pretty fly and he was telling the truth but see that's what but I ain't got time to listen to them tapes oh you got to go to Walmart oh they have many yard sale I ain't never figured that in out yet I ain't bought a yard yet I can't understand languages I went to town one day me and my wife did and we looked up there and there was this big old sign and it was great big sign said carport sale she looked at me or I looked at her one of the two during the conversation said they ain't got no carport so we went to town and we came back you know what they done while we gone they raced that out and they put either Port sale or yard sale or something you know somebody probably told them said you ain't got no car for it to sell but listen church has this message got dull to you that you don't enjoy hearing it you don't enjoy reading it and studying it what about I'm studying most of the time in something relation to what I preach my wife a lot of times I'll tell you and I do it too she'll say honey we just heard that tape night before last I told her I said but there's something I'm thinking about well it's okay she she said it's all right we need to listen to it again and she to her she's listening to it she's done heard it two nights before but to me I'm listening to it and I remember something he said over there I want to go back and listen to it again you know my point you're not preachers you don't have to plan what you're going to listen to you can just put on the tape and you just enjoy listening the 40s and the 50s and the 60s as preachers as we got to be doing a little bit of studying but get to point now has the message continually open to you I believe that brother brandham was a prophet I believe that amen but I believe he was a human being and I believe the message went from partial to perfect realization with him over the years that he preached I don't believe that he knew everything when he came because that would be contrary and he'd be telling you a lie and you'd be in problem because when he gets to the to the seals he said you know he didn't see that and when he said says on statute of perfect man he said I just got this the other day you know just quotes Okay but listen he said one day he said I used to believe that Jesus loved me and God hated me he said until I found out it the same person that's growth in development right you know that the Bible even says about Jesus that he growed in Grace and knowledge amen now that's what the scripture says about the Lord Jesus all right so we're going to grow in Grace and knowledge if not we're going to be a stunned birth or you know kids that don't grow up and I'm going to make this statement and just leave it that's why that I think that the biggest portion of the Ministers of the hour they lose their families because they don't have any growth development to try to help them now you can say well you ought not say that brother Dale well okay you find me some other way to say it and I'll back up but you got a lot of people in this message that their family didn't want nothing don't want nothing to do with the message what if it is that they were not presenting the message in the right order you know yourself that you've you know preachers that is preaching the same six and seven they was 40 years ago they still preaching on women's hiring clothes and dresses and right amen I believe in preaching it I believe in preaching it as an experience and then it'll take care of the clothes and the hir and the dress and the thing but see a growth development can keep people interested right that's right you know you keep them interested just like I I said now I I'd like for you to listen to who is this mzed for the weekend well then you ought to know that something in there is going to be brought out and that way you can listen to it ahead of time bl's God I listen what I want to go ahead do what you want to you are anyway but you see that's just me but you see everything I see in the Bible goes from a partial realization to a perfect realization the godhead has to start off and to see Christ and to see as Wade was bringing out the logos amen we'll get to that where it's the word speech I know you won't do it now and I won't ask you to so when you get home tonight turn the back of your hand towards your mouth and breathe on it you feel the wind right well don't blow just speak and say hallelujah you're going to feel the wind what is that song about the wind blowing blowing you're going to feel the wind because you know what we'll get to it the Lord willing Sunday the bride is born by the Breath of God Amen that's right born by the Breath of God what about it partial to perfect I see the godhead going and climbing greater and greater but see one you see it climbing greater and greater that's why in 1969 my first sermon was what that the Bride of Jesus Christ would be the son of man quoting brother brandom it's grow it ever since then until it's come to the bases that I've quoted it to you and give it to you many times where brother R said she will be the fullness of the godhead bodily will be in The Bride of Jesus Christ so you know it's not just stopping or some one- thought sermon that everybody rejoices about one little thing or something that's fine but what about the growth development in our souls you know what I pray when I come to church here or anywhere else you know what I pray well I'm on my way there I said Lord my soul is hungry I need a good meal Lord feed me that's the last thing is said right there before the minister enters the P pit is Lord feed me I'm hungry Lord I want to know more about you you mean after all that you preached in all these years you want to know more about God I sure do and I know for a certainty there's a whole lot more to know right what about it partial to perfect what about any other thought that you could take throughout the Bible to where you'd see it unfold said on Daniel 70 weeks he said if you don't understand this you won't understand the rest he even named the seals and things he said you won't understand it but nobody wants to know about the Daniel 70 weeks but they've got their own idea they didn't got it figured out see well where's the growth development where did the seals open from that you know a lot of people the message believe that brother Brandon was wrong in his early Ministry but the son of man finally come and straightened him out and they only want to hear what's after the seals well if you're going to make once before the Seal's partial realization I still love to hear those old 47s and 50 and 60 and and things well because it's a constant unveiling to a man that he's telling his experience you ever notice this just one little Point there's a lot of messages called hear ye him you know there's some of those messages that brother randam never mentions adoption but yet you ask people about adoption here he him there's a lot of messages on there that he's just plainly saying hear ye him hear him he's the word partial to perfect what about justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost what about invisible Union if you'll go to it and listen to a prophet and he's explaining justification and he's explaining it as you just repenting of your sins then in the same message in a little bit he comes around to the bases say it's as though you never done it he's talking about justification going through the same message and you'll hear him say the real you never did do it right and he's talking about justification he's talking about from partial to perfect what about sanctification where the unclean Spirit goes out then Paul picks it up in his writings and he says we're Washed by the Water of the word cleansing that takes place daily in an individual in the new birth then what about a sanctification that comes to S of a Clarity under the seals until this world will eventually be totally wiped off and cleansed partial to perfect what about the baptism of the Holy Ghost where you're born again by faith each one of these virtues the prophet says you're being birthed into these things well I thought we only had one birth you got one birth bringing you into the body but every day ought to be a birthing of the word what about it what about Peter we read Being Born Again by The Incorruptible word of God which liveth and abideth forever what about such a baptism with the Holy Ghost that the prophet said will fill every fiber of our being and take us into Rapture what about a baptism that will totally baptize this whole world and systems so everything goes from partial to perfect I know brother Gary's listening tonight and he came to me one day and he said brother Dale I see it he said you got to see God in the bride first I know he's listening and he knows the answer I said brother you can't do that I said you got to see God in Christ first before you can see Christ in the church partial to perfect amen you got to see it in Christ then you can see it in you you can't see it in you first partial to perfect has your Revelation dried up has it come to where that you were really interested in studying the message for a while when you begin to to go through the doctrines and the ideas and and all but then it begin to dry up well brother Dale I've dried up on you you don't have to tell me and hav been preaching too long you don't have to tell me I know a lot of you is dried up but you can't blame me CU I'll tried I've tried to keep something in front of you if it's nothing else but a carrot in front of the dony you remember the story that's right not calling you a donkey or nothing but just is the point you're a little serious so get your seriousness off get something in front of you and hold it up what did the prophet say he said hold up one subject until they get it before you move on but yet some of you are even now disinterested in the point of me preaching so much on the new birth I've tried okay I'll end it with the story was where that the old fell preached on something one time so much till the deacons got together and said ain't there something else you can preach on besides just repenting and straight enough he said let everybody repent straighten up and I'll go on something else I'm just telling you don't dry up in a Time when we need the opening of the word don't become what is the word complacent you know or just sitting back relaxing and thinking you know so much don't ever do that don't think well brother I tell you what if if all these other churches going we got a pretty good chance of going cuz we're way above them in the word don't ever think that you got the wrong idea this pastor has never taught you nothing like that I've always t your growth development tried to feed you keep something there to keep you to thinking about it keep something to where you'd be interested in studying partial to perfect perfect brings you to what a positive attitude see if I can tell take it down here to New Birth and handle the whole message down here and then handle it going up through the statue of perfect man is way just finished and everybody knows it went up through there and a marvelous job bringing out all of these things and then can come into a headstone with it and not have to get another doctorine to start it you know what a lot of people in this message think that headstone is polygamy right now that really run good ain't it I don't I wonder where they're negative at that or their partial realization got started if that's the positive attitude to wind up that it's polygamy what do you think so that's why I'm not discouraged with us being here you know a lot of the people of the message are totally discouraged about being here 40 years or after of the Prophet being gone I'm tickled to death that's right right amen yes sir you know why I'm tickled to death because I stood here 40 something years ago and told you how this was going to go and I got the tapes to prove it told you how it's going to wind up told you how it's going to end you think I don't I don't have no problems with being but with people not listening to me that's no problem that doesn't bother me what bothers me is when we claim to believe the message right you see this man something has told you in this man backslide you'll see this man gone you won't see him hanging around but the people of this message they just titty tatter now past 10 15 years you just had this up and down very few doctrines has got started if you watched it's just kind of up and down floating cuz they don't know what's going on the Bible says they that know their God shall do exploits we have been taught 40 years ago what to look for that's taking place today right why because I believed it I believe it now I believe there'll come a times I told you Sunday there'll come a time when there'll be the Bible the prophet said that come since an outpouring of the Holy Ghost to fill out of our fiber of our being take us in the Rapture well you know if it falls on us it's going to fall out to the people are going to be shouting and hollering I told you my message was right I told you this two Soul two Lords was right look what's taking place but then all all at once I believe this those things will be going there'll be a great anointing all at once God's going to pull back the anointing off of everything but the bride right I've never made it that strong but I believe he'll do it right he'll pull it back for a moment cuz the prophet said he's going to show her right for just a moment well does that mean we're going to no you know what that could mean that we're preaching to 191 countries from Lula Georgia right only five more to go we need to reach from Lula Georgia that don't make you happy amen your money is what's doing it y your prayers and you're doing is what s ending this why don't you H get happy about it come on brother am let's stand come on little boy come on musicians partial to perfect that's right everything I look at is partial to perfect y That's Right might not look the way you look but it's according to the word amen amen that it's going to come to a place that God's going to show who is his bride amen no not empty in hospitals we don't deal in that not those type of things but somebody's going to stand on the word and going to say it don't make no difference why what you believe or what they believe you know that back in about 1970 that they were talking about Brother Ray can probably remember they were talking about that they'd be able to some way get together and they'd figure out somebody in the message and they even Nam some big names preachers and would send them over to the to the uh World Council of churches to represent us I don't want nobody representing me I want Christ amen to represent me amen I'll just stand on my own then and but brother Dale you just too you just won't join up with nobody no I can't I have to walk alone and I'm sorry but I walk along with the Lord in what's revealed to me right right I enjoy what other people has to say but I still can't do it I can't just hear somebody in the message and just jump up and grab that message and preach it you know I can't do it I've got to walk alone with the word and any true Minister will do that if not he's not no true minister of God if you don't walk with God and just walk along with him that's why I never tell these brothers I don't uhuh don't say you're following me cuz that that's going to mess you up you get the Revelation from Jesus Christ and you bring it if it's right we don't have no problems with it if it's wrong we don't have no problem with it because the Lord take care of us right he'll work out of time I ain't never had no worry about nothing because I know who Jesus Christ is what we got let's stand 138 spiral my hope is buil nothing less than Jesus blood and righteous I dare not trust the sweetest FR but holy Le on Jesus name Christ Rock what about it do you have a positive attitude about what you believe are you afraid of what you believe about Christ anybody sing all other ground sing his support me in theing BL and all around my soul look at the way the world's going today look what they're doing look what it's turning out to be no outside of Jesus Christ with trumpet sound oh may I then in him be found dressed in his rightousness alone forless to stand Before the Throne on Christ Rock I stand all other ground is sinking all other ground is sinking sand my hope is built on nothing father we send these prayer claws Lord like our brother was testifying to the things that happens when we send out these words of praise to you because that's what these PR claws mean and you just take care of the needs this there that our brother is asking for in Jesus name anybody else have a Christ all other ground sing all other sinking you know you always look at the natural to see the spiritual I told you about it the other day and you may think it's crazy but I need to go back and try to find the magazine that I was reading it in because it wasn't a a tableid you know which you know what I mean by that you don't know whether of them is true or not these others supposed to be and they're actually working now with thought transmitting they have been able to transmit to an animal a command to get the animal to do what they ask it to do he said they can transmit thoughts one human to another you say that's impossible at the end of World War II the story was told that they already had developed a system that they could fly an airplane over a city and control the minds of the people from that airplane brother Mo said that they were teaching them when at the end of World War II of decomposing a human body and send it to California and put it back together he said they can decompose it and send it they just just don't know how to put it back together all of these things you see on a lot of these space movies what is that guy beam me up whoot Scotty beam me up Scotty and the guys go straight up to the other floor I remember when Superman was flying through the air Buck Rogers was a space traveling from one planet to another and had ray guns and this was back in the 40s you think they don't have them now only in that time they were talking about being able to make a hovercraft that would be able to keep the soldiers from being killed as coming in off of the ocean because they had to get to the land they've got them now that can come right in lift right up carry them over and Sh them down hovercrafts that can just do anything they want to they're in atomic energy so great until they can move mountains do you know why that they can't put radar too low it's got to be above the mountain range do you know why because that radar will cut the top off of that mountain they're already far Advanced into what you think when they can capture every word that you say did not your Prophet say your words keeps on going they can right now capture all that's being said in this building and don't have to be here to hear it science is progressing so much because see I thought that brother brandham said one day we'll just travel like a thought just travel like a thought you know I believe he's right you know that they've been dealing for quite a while with jet airplanes to fly by asot connected to the human brain the reason is that you take those jets flying 2,000 M hour it takes a split second for that brain to turn to the hands to get it to move but if you're doing it with your eyesight you just turn your eyesight in the plane of dirt goes the way you're looking they've been doing that a long time we're in a scientific age because they have broken into God's laboratory is that the words of the Prophet the imagination of man's mind is what continually evil but is ever what he can think of he can do it that's right what about it you believe we're in the end time you say well why did you bring that up because that's part of the message because you see you could start off back in the early days when we had Oliver and Wilbur R trying to fly on airplane for a couple of hundred feet and the story was told that their daddy right before then told his two boys because he'd heard about these airplanes coming into existence and he told his two boys he said Son get up and let's get out of here all this here heathenism stuff and there was Oliver and Wilbur right was the two boys the one who flew the first plane what do you think about it my point without the word none of these things would have ever come into existence that's right what about the word to you Lord Jesus we've just committed what we believe we commit it into your hands and just give it we don't deal on scientific knowledge that much and you know it the people knows that it's just sometimes just to stop and think how smart mankind has become but it's only because that there is an eternal God that is the most negative part that could ever be that could not be we know but any thoughts of negativity in in your realm Lord would be so positive it would be far beyond Mankind's ideas today but we thank you that you've given us your word and if they just studied your word it would saved them a lot of trouble Amen to figure out a lot of things thank you Father be with us take care of the people on the way home be with the sick touch each one in Jesus name amen you dismiss I care today what tomorrow may bring Shadow or sunshine or rain the Lord I know Ruth or everything and all of My worry is vain living
