[1:09] somewhere
[1:13] somewhere else
[2:04] is have you heard your name called right
[2:08] through the opening of the YouTube

[2:28] meeting at brother pageant if you want
[2:31] to go with us make sure you let us know
[2:34] ahead of time not on that day to call
[2:37] you know but just remember and I think
[2:40] that's basically all the announcements
[2:41] and just remember that I'd rather have a
[2:44] brother called my singer with us today
[2:46] about house Mr Ginger with us because
[2:49] everywhere that he's at that's the only
[2:51] thing that's worth anything is hurt
[2:56] amen
[3:00] amen not just kidding but we're just
[3:03] looking forward to the word of the Lord
[3:05] so let's just go right on the end of the
[3:07] service and sing Open the Eyes of My
[3:09] Heart yes brother singer Bartlesville
[3:12] Oklahoma comes to speak the word of the
[3:14] Lord amen
[3:23] foreign
[4:29] Holy Holy Holy Spirit
[4:35] all the way
[4:45] home hey man hey man that's true
[4:48] it's wonderful I believe this is a
[4:50] generation where we've come face to face
[4:53] Amanda brother Ram said in the uh the
[4:55] church age book it's complete
[4:56] realization you know I'm not proven
[4:59] anymore brother that's right I'm not
[5:01] probing that this message we have thus
[5:04] saith the Lord we have a perfect
[5:05] interpretation of this message we have
[5:08] perfect Faith that's coming this way
[5:09] right so I'm not guessing anymore I'm
[5:12] not filming right we have thus saith
[5:14] Lord or we keep still that's what he
[5:16] said is that right so it's just a it's
[5:18] just a very powerful message that we
[5:20] have in this hour right and uh I'm just
[5:23] glad I happen to be here to be able to
[5:25] receive it right from Atlanta does it
[5:28] make me something special not really
[5:29] matter of fact the more Revelation you
[5:32] get the more it humbles one of the last
[5:34] messages brother Brandon preach was
[5:36] humble thyself right and I believe if
[5:38] you want humility if God gives you a
[5:40] revelation I don't believe it'll give
[5:42] you a big head and exaltion I believe
[5:44] when you get a revelation it will
[5:47] so if you get a revelation it makes you
[5:50] think you're this big somebody then uh
[5:52] I'm really questioning your Revelation
[5:54] I'll just be honest it's good to be here
[5:57] it's good to be with brother Samuel and
[5:59] if I lived in Lula or around this area
[6:01] this is where I built a church
[6:03] I love coming here because I can feel
[6:05] the Liberty to say what's on my heart
[6:07] and I know if I messed something up that
[6:09] man will straighten it out
[6:16] I'm just uh I'm not an evangelist I'm
[6:19] not a missionary I'm a pastor and I very
[6:22] seldom get away from the little church
[6:23] there they really don't want me to go I
[6:26] mean they make me feel so guilty when I
[6:29] travel they'll tell me almost everybody
[6:30] there told me we don't want you to go
[6:32] brother Claude but I just sometimes you
[6:35] just need to get away and have a little
[6:37] vacation rest your mind and your body
[6:39] it's been uh the last year's been a real
[6:42] struggle on my body I've I had a
[6:45] pneumonia and a bladder infection in
[6:46] December the first part of the month and
[6:49] it's never gone away I've been on five
[6:50] bouts of antibiotics and antibiotics
[6:53] just tear me up it's just really
[6:54] physically I'm in rough shape at the end
[6:57] of the second service I've asked brother
[6:58] Samuel brother Wade to pray for me and I
[7:01] told the church the only way I quit
[7:04] preaching is when my toes go up
[7:10] all right
[7:13] and I'm gonna keep saying this message
[7:15] I'm going to keep Ministry and I'm
[7:17] present day truth until I die I'm going
[7:20] to be honest with you so when I believe
[7:23] uh the Rapture is at hand I don't
[7:25] believe we have very many days to wait
[7:27] right uh you know God's been long long
[7:30] suffering toward us word we're not
[7:33] waiting on him he's waiting on us right
[7:34] yeah okay so the real problem is us to
[7:37] get ourself out of the way let go
[7:38] without God and that's what God's trying
[7:40] to get in the bride is preeminence in
[7:44] the church is that right so anyway I I
[7:48] appreciate each and every one of you
[7:49] pray for me if you would in the days
[7:51] ahead I'm actually supposed to have a
[7:53] surgery about 10 days when I get back so
[7:55] they don't know exactly what's wrong
[7:57] with me but I really don't want to get
[7:59] it done and fighting it I really don't
[8:02] want it so you pray for me please I'd
[8:05] like to read a scripture to start out in
[8:07] Hebrews 4 and 2 and I believe this is a
[8:09] real problem that's among the ministry
[8:11] can I tell you that and about some of
[8:13] the people in the church so let's read
[8:16] this I want to title the sermon today I
[8:18] know and I don't I'm not talking about
[8:20] just me that I don't know I want you to
[8:23] say I know amen because what Brethren
[8:25] said it's going to take a personal
[8:27] experience a personal revelation from
[8:30] you right and what a revelation is it's
[8:32] when you know he gets flat no man
[8:34] there's no doubt there's no there's no
[8:36] shadow in it at all I believe we've come
[8:39] and I've said it to the complete
[8:41] realization to where I can say I know
[8:44] now some people may say brother Claude
[8:46] you're a know-it-all no I'm not but I
[8:48] want to tell you something by this
[8:50] message I know right I have a spiritual
[8:52] understanding that there's no devil in
[8:55] hell can talk me away there's no devil
[8:58] hell could talk me away from this
[9:00] message nothing I cannot fall away
[9:02] around that right you fall away
[9:04] justification you can fall away at
[9:06] sanctification but you can't fall away
[9:07] where I'm at right man is that right and
[9:10] each and every one of you have to have a
[9:11] Pentecostal experience is that right I
[9:14] mean the Pentecostal spirit is an
[9:16] original experience it's not created or
[9:19] dogmaed it's an original experience of
[9:23] one-on-one with God okay so let's read
[9:26] Hebrews four and two let's go there
[9:28] first yeah she'll put it up there for me
[9:31] for unto us was the Gospel preached as
[9:35] well as unto them but the word preached
[9:37] did not profit them not being mixed and
[9:42] I put United okay with faith right okay
[9:45] and then that hurt it right Ram said a
[9:48] drunk on the street could hear the
[9:49] message but if they don't have it in
[9:52] faith to unite with what they hear right
[9:54] they're not going to get it is that
[9:55] right that's right so we have many
[9:57] people even in message churches that
[9:59] have heard the message but they're not
[10:01] they don't have faith that's why we have
[10:04] such a great Falling Away now brother
[10:06] Branham said faith is higher than your
[10:08] intellect right right so we've had
[10:10] people that heard it and have caught it
[10:11] by their natural intellect but they
[10:14] don't have a revelation right brother
[10:16] random said there's nothing higher than
[10:18] a revelation there's no such prevailing
[10:21] or as a revelation amen right so what we
[10:24] need to pray for more than our necessary
[10:26] meat is what he said was a revelation
[10:28] from God that's right once you get that
[10:30] Revelation then you could say I know
[10:32] right right is that right it's not I'm
[10:35] probing I think it's this way I believe
[10:39] it Brethren said you ain't got a thought
[10:41] coming right but it's I know okay now
[10:44] look here's a couple of instances in the
[10:46] scripture where they say I know okay for
[10:49] I know is job 19 and 25 that's right
[10:52] remember uh job is on his ass sheet for
[10:55] seven days is that what brother Graham
[10:56] said right you know what the sheep was
[10:59] it was a dunk yeah and he was down in
[11:01] the dumps can I say it that's what I
[11:03] keep on I use okibonics okay job was
[11:07] down how many have been down in the
[11:08] dumps
[11:10] see we we spend time on our ass sheet
[11:12] just like job did right do you know
[11:14] Jesus was what died on Golgotha and it
[11:18] was a place of the skull there's three
[11:20] holes you know what those three holes
[11:21] wears where they burnt City trash did
[11:24] you know that they took their trash in
[11:25] Jerusalem yeah they took it out on
[11:27] golgoth and they burned it in those
[11:28] holes they literally crucified our Lord
[11:31] in a dump right right you know the
[11:34] greatest Revelation that ever came was
[11:36] in a dump right Jesus was on his ass
[11:38] sheet what a great Revelation is that
[11:41] right and he said it's finished how much
[11:43] greater can a revelation be it's
[11:45] finished is that right amen all that the
[11:47] law had wrote about it it was finished
[11:49] right there and that same way with you
[11:51] you get on your ass sheep you think well
[11:53] I've got depression I've got this that
[11:55] or the other big deal quit feeling sorry
[11:58] for yourself right we all go through
[12:00] that we're humans right right but at
[12:02] that hour God will bring you the
[12:04] greatest Revelation in that time okay so
[12:07] do I believe there's gonna be pressure
[12:09] on the church yeah yeah do I believe
[12:11] we're gonna have to be on our ass sheet
[12:13] yep sure do amen so just just deal with
[12:16] it quit being a baby we we got the
[12:19] message let's let's believe what our
[12:21] prophets says okay for I know that my
[12:23] redeemer will liveth and that he shall
[12:26] stand at the latter day upon the Earth
[12:28] right so job said I know what did job
[12:31] had or a revelation right right right
[12:33] God had revealed something and he said I
[12:36] know in my flesh I'll see him right so
[12:38] job received a great Revelation and it
[12:40] was no such prevailing power right
[12:42] there's that Revelation that he received
[12:44] John 4 and 25 the woman saith in him I
[12:47] know that Messiah that messiah's cometh
[12:51] which is called price when he come he
[12:54] will tell us all things amen amen what
[12:57] did she have she had a revelation yeah
[12:59] right is that right she had something
[13:01] the scribes and the Pharisees didn't
[13:03] have right right they had the letter of
[13:05] the word you could stick a pen through a
[13:07] rolled up document they can tell you the
[13:09] letter that he had gone through but what
[13:11] they didn't have was a revelation right
[13:13] they did not know and there's even
[13:15] scripture that I have in all these notes
[13:17] here that I can't feel through but it
[13:21] said you know what they took from the
[13:22] people knowledge right you know what
[13:25] they did they took the Commandments that
[13:27] Moses did they created a Torah and they
[13:30] become dependent on the do's and the
[13:31] don'ts rather than the actual word
[13:34] itself right isn't that what they did
[13:36] you go look at the tour it's like 316
[13:38] do's and don'ts that they contrived from
[13:41] the law of Moses is that right if they
[13:44] had just left it alone
[13:47] just left it as it was right thus saith
[13:50] the Lord it would have been much better
[13:51] for the people right but what did they
[13:53] do by their knowledge by their intellect
[13:56] they preached it away from the people
[13:57] right is that right so we've had a
[14:00] prophet in this hour to come and to
[14:01] bring us a revelation to bring it back
[14:04] to us is what it was right so that's
[14:06] what I want to say I know so and it's
[14:09] not and I say I don't want you to look
[14:10] at me when I say all right but I'm gonna
[14:11] have to I want it to be personal right I
[14:14] as a personal pronoun you have to get to
[14:16] the point where you say I know amen
[14:18] exactly where a preacher can't come and
[14:20] preach the Revelation if if he can come
[14:23] and take it away from you you never had
[14:24] a revelation because once you get a
[14:26] revelation it's rock solid it's a stone
[14:29] you understand it's something that's a
[14:31] what is Faith it's a foundation amen
[14:35] well it appeared men what was it look
[14:36] it's a foundation what does foundation
[14:39] mean it's established when you get a
[14:42] foundation out it's established that's
[14:43] right right and is that right so we we
[14:46] have been the that we have been restored
[14:48] to the faith of the fathers amen does
[14:50] everybody agree with that so I could say
[14:52] this morning I want you to say along
[14:53] with me I know I
[14:56] I know
[14:58] dear heavenly father we thank you Lord
[15:00] for the real word we pray that you'll
[15:02] break it down to the people oh God lord
[15:04] I know the ministry here is just a very
[15:06] strong Ministry Lord and I can't come
[15:09] and I'm not going to preach a different
[15:10] Christ or to bring a new revelation I'm
[15:13] just going to preach what you put on my
[15:15] heart on father and I pray that your
[15:17] equipment to the congregation oh God and
[15:19] just bless them now in Jesus Christ's
[15:21] name we ask it amen uh if you would show
[15:25] that slide on conduct order and Doctrine
[15:27] I've actually started it's been almost a
[15:30] year now that I've been preaching on a
[15:32] conduct order in Doctrine yeah but you
[15:35] know the Little Red Book everybody's got
[15:37] that right that was put together by Roy
[15:39] borders I believe the Roy borders was
[15:41] really led by the Holy Spirit and doing
[15:43] that right because I in my heart I
[15:45] started you know we do like like you do
[15:48] you do different series on Revelations
[15:49] I've done a Hebrews series we do Daniel
[15:52] 70 weeks I did like 18 sermons on it and
[15:55] what we try to do as ministers Brethren
[15:57] said get in the cooling room I couldn't
[15:58] answer the conversation that's what
[16:00] we're supposed to do we're always going
[16:02] to read between the lines what are we
[16:04] supposed to do mix it with face right
[16:05] man what we've got around the message of
[16:07] ours a bunch of preachers when they
[16:09] argue with you you know what they'll do
[16:10] so brother Ram said this over here and
[16:12] then we'll say well he said this over
[16:14] here yeah but what they don't do is if
[16:16] you've got to take those two
[16:17] congregations and if you don't mix it
[16:19] with faith right what do you what are
[16:21] you arguing you're saying they said
[16:23] something different here than what he
[16:24] said there right and they'll say oh damn
[16:26] and I'm going to use it because uh it's
[16:27] I think it's just something that's just
[16:29] abused bad it's Daniel's 70 weeks right
[16:32] he'll say well brother random said this
[16:33] over here you got a progressive
[16:34] revelation you said this over here yeah
[16:36] and like I've told people I really get
[16:39] annoyed when they say the word
[16:40] Progressive you know why I can't find in
[16:43] the message I'll challenge anybody that
[16:45] has the message put the word Progressive
[16:47] in see if you find it right but I will
[16:49] tell you it's the stimulation of
[16:50] Revelation man what does why do it gets
[16:53] stronger with AIDS so brother Brandon
[16:55] what did he do pre he preached his
[16:57] understanding that he had in that hour
[16:58] is that right but they say over here in
[17:02] the seals we'll run around change that
[17:03] there's only three and a half years left
[17:04] not seven yeah well they don't
[17:06] understand brother random in the
[17:08] beginning of the first seal he's
[17:12] from Daniel 70 weeks right what he's
[17:14] trying to get to is the ministry the son
[17:16] of man Ministry And that son of man
[17:19] Ministry is seven years well that Jews
[17:21] only have three and a half years left
[17:23] the ministry so when brother rabbit is
[17:26] commenting about only three and a half
[17:27] left he's talking about they only have
[17:29] three and a half years of ministry but
[17:31] the reason the preachers fail they don't
[17:34] mix it with faith right amen and the
[17:36] people that believe that three and a
[17:37] half they won't even show the the chart
[17:39] where he showed seven we've got
[17:42] handwritten notes at a restaurant where
[17:43] he showed Brothers this is the way it is
[17:45] he hit another so there's two there two
[17:48] witnesses where brother random wrote it
[17:49] down did Brother Brown remember say my
[17:51] chart was wrong he said no eight times a
[17:54] day and he said look at my chart if you
[17:56] want to understand that look at the
[17:57] chart I mean I don't find anywhere in
[18:00] the seals anywhere well brother Graham
[18:02] said I was wrong if Daniel send me wings
[18:05] all right but I will show you 1954 when
[18:08] he preached the seals when he came to
[18:10] preach the seals here in 6 C3 he said I
[18:13] didn't have it right then I preach it
[18:15] like Larkin I preached it like Uriah
[18:17] Smith right because why the Thunders had
[18:21] not uttered yet does everybody
[18:23] understand that the Thunders had to
[18:25] uttered yet to reveal the mystery tooth
[18:27] truce that was contained Under the Sea
[18:29] that's right amen Okay so
[18:32] what I want you I want you you should I
[18:35] know we know can I say it out way we
[18:38] should come now to where the confusion's
[18:40] out of the message
[18:42] confusions it's always been the
[18:44] preachers that are the confused right
[18:45] Amen in the days of Moses there were 70
[18:48] preachers that come to him right one
[18:50] marriage and divorce wasn't it right and
[18:53] they said what are we going to do Moses
[18:55] here we got this problem what are we
[18:56] going to do what was it a bunch of
[18:58] confused preachers right who
[18:59] straightened it up Moses so if we got a
[19:02] bunch of confused preachers around the
[19:03] message why don't they go to the message
[19:06] why don't they go to the desk
[19:09] they'll do is they'll take a quote here
[19:12] and they'll isolate the quote and you go
[19:15] to scripture in isolate a quote yeah and
[19:17] if you do that it says go do likewise
[19:20] and then once says go hang yourself so
[19:22] we all going to go hang ourselves now
[19:24] you isolate scripture you'll have it all
[19:26] messed up that's right amen but what we
[19:28] don't have in the message is among the
[19:31] preachers
[19:38] what are they doing they're not getting
[19:40] the continuity of the message
[19:44] what is it a lack of faith
[19:48] they don't have faith they're not taking
[19:50] they're not taking the clothes and
[19:52] mixing it with faith exactly that's
[19:54] exactly what happened when Jesus was
[19:56] here the scribes and the Pharisees the
[19:59] ministry at that hour did not mix it
[20:02] with faith amen and because they didn't
[20:04] mix it with faith They Crucified him
[20:06] amen right right is that right they had
[20:09] all the quotes right they had the law
[20:12] right the scripture says the law is
[20:14] perfect converting the soul
[20:17] does everybody understand the law is
[20:19] perfect right amen it really is and
[20:21] we'll get into this I'm almost getting
[20:23] going I gotta warm up a little while
[20:24] okay but what I started in our church
[20:27] was I took the little red bus I'm gonna
[20:29] preach a series on conduct order and
[20:30] Doctrine well so I
[20:34] come on guys we ought to have the
[20:37] conduct down right but you can't pick up
[20:39] a tape or brother Ramsey don't tell you
[20:41] women don't cut your hair and tell your
[20:43] men that you're supposed to be honest
[20:45] don't do a bad deal right if you're out
[20:47] there doing bad deals do you know you're
[20:49] not even into Jubilee no that's right
[20:51] exactly amen I've got a scripture in
[20:54] Romans that tells you the Jubilee State
[20:56] yeah I believe we're in Jubilee time
[20:58] right right
[21:08] and at the time of the Jubilee it says
[21:11] oh no man anything right
[21:13] did you know in the Jubilee when the
[21:15] time came for the release that you you
[21:17] all your debts were paid right right you
[21:20] were all the same if if you'd see I got
[21:23] land you got land we got the same amount
[21:25] of land but if you hopped your land
[21:28] because you made some bad deals right at
[21:31] the time of the 50 the golden jubilee
[21:33] when it sounded you could throw down
[21:35] your hole you could go home right does
[21:37] everybody agree with that that's what it
[21:40] is that's what the Jubilee is so at that
[21:42] point you owe no man anything amen so if
[21:44] you're spending bad deals out there if
[21:46] you're out of business what you're
[21:47] you're old people yeah you're owing them
[21:50] you're not in a jubilee State all right
[21:52] we can says don't commit adultery in the
[21:55] Romans I think it's 13. if you go read
[21:57] the scripture that's talking about a
[21:59] jubilee state right so we as bride
[22:02] should be in the state of Jubilee right
[22:04] man if everybody agree with that you
[22:05] should be shouldn't be patient you
[22:07] shouldn't be an adultery you shouldn't
[22:08] be lying you shouldn't be stealing right
[22:10] if you're in a jubilee State you're not
[22:13] going to be doing those things that's
[22:14] right and if you're doing them you're
[22:16] not in a jubilee State
[22:19] because Jubilee is a state it's
[22:22] something it's a being do you understand
[22:24] that's what Jubilee is about right so
[22:27] there's there's where we have to be as a
[22:29] church right and I believe the bride
[22:32] comes to that amen and I'm gonna be
[22:34] honest with you I don't know who it is
[22:35] or who haven't been here some of you may
[22:37] be Church some of you may be drunk right
[22:39] you know the church gets Sanctified once
[22:42] sure yeah but they didn't go on to get
[22:44] the Holy Ghost right that's right you
[22:46] could be sitting right here in this
[22:47] church and you don't have the Holy Ghost
[22:48] you're going to be tribulation Saints
[22:50] right yeah yeah does everybody
[22:52] understand what I'm saying right you as
[22:54] long as you don't reject this message
[22:56] brother Adam said you reject this
[22:58] message you go straight on the head all
[23:00] right amen so you're going to go through
[23:01] tripping you're gonna bust it why I
[23:03] don't go right to hell if you reject
[23:04] this man right right man right right so
[23:08] we can't I hope everybody's got conduct
[23:10] down yeah is your life worthy of the
[23:13] Gospel isn't that pretty easy every tape
[23:15] everything brother man tells us about
[23:17] her conduct now order does everybody
[23:19] understand what order really is it's law
[23:22] right now what keeps order law right
[23:25] what keeps the order in America law
[23:27] right so see we all have the law now
[23:30] brother man said in one thing and and I
[23:32] don't remember if this is seals I've
[23:33] been I want to get to the seals here in
[23:35] a minute I'm just trying to get warmed
[23:37] up I gotta get warmed up Peggy yeah all
[23:40] right so that's where I'm at so what is
[23:42] it the order is law you understand
[23:45] remember in Malachi 4 it says that that
[23:48] Elijah is going to restore our faith
[23:50] back to the apostolic fathers do you
[23:52] know what the faith of the apostolic's
[23:53] fathers were law
[23:55] I know that kind of may shock you but
[23:57] brother random said it there's one quote
[23:58] I found where I thought well sure it is
[24:00] sure look what's going to be so easy
[24:03] look the Malachi the Elijah that comes
[24:05] to the Jews is not going to restore him
[24:07] to the law no no they never left it
[24:09] right the Jews never left the law it was
[24:12] the Gentiles that left the law I know go
[24:15] out to any Baptist go out there and it's
[24:16] hope you know you log on apply
[24:19] Deuteronomy 22
[24:21] reply all right the state of jubilee
[24:23] don't apply anymore right most message
[24:26] churches you you believe the message you
[24:28] pretty well do what you want yeah
[24:29] preacher's gonna be married two three
[24:31] times
[24:34] times right no that's chaos that's job
[24:38] order right the opposite of the law or
[24:40] order is chaos right now so what what
[24:43] did our Prophet do He restored us back
[24:45] to the apostolic the faith of the
[24:47] absolute father amen what was the faith
[24:50] of the Arkansas absolutely thought
[24:51] Brethren said the prophets preached
[24:53] Moses all of them preached a portion
[24:55] right Jesus was the fullest of the word
[24:58] the law standing there right Jesus came
[25:00] not to do away with the law but to
[25:03] fulfill one man the law was fulfilled In
[25:07] the Flesh of Jesus Christ amen right and
[25:10] the and the apostles all accepted the
[25:13] Christ right right
[25:15] what has happened through the church
[25:17] ages through the dogma and the Creeds
[25:20] the Holy Ghost has been bound again
[25:22] through the church ages so we had to
[25:25] have a prophet to come and preach
[25:27] Jubilee to sound the trumpet so what
[25:30] restore our faith back to the apostolic
[25:33] fathers
[25:35] the law to put Law and Order back into
[25:38] the church so don't tell me order is not
[25:41] important order is very important
[25:44] yes sir that's one of the two things the
[25:47] prophet is supposed to do restore law to
[25:50] restore order into the church and yet
[25:53] you go into some messy churches and it's
[25:55] a mess
[25:56] there's no law there's no order it's
[25:58] chaos
[26:00] is that what it is you go too you'd have
[26:03] been around you here
[26:05] right preachers falling right and left
[26:06] people dropping out of the message chaos
[26:09] is that right
[26:11] you know what what really gets me you
[26:14] got people now they're dropping out
[26:16] I'm sorry I just uh
[26:19] not a wind a little bit anyway you get
[26:22] people in
[26:23] and we hear it they say well
[26:25] what about 1977 what about Daniel what
[26:28] do you think they're falling out for
[26:29] creatures aren't explaining it
[26:31] why are some of these people falling
[26:33] away the failure of the ministry
[26:36] we'll get over the people and say oh
[26:38] they're Antichrist we'll just throw them
[26:39] away now
[26:41] a lot of it's the fault of the music
[26:43] you know why do they have questions all
[26:45] day because the preacher won't preach it
[26:48] what do you expect them to do right and
[26:51] so you got this man over here preacher
[26:53] saying this and this one's saying that
[26:54] their preacher won't even comment on it
[26:56] he says well that's to the Jews yeah it
[27:00] is it makes me sick when we're supposed
[27:03] to be in Revelation 10 where we're
[27:05] eating the whole book right right last
[27:07] time I checked Daniel was a part of the
[27:09] book
[27:11] am I missing something or am I just
[27:13] stupid or what so they'll say well
[27:15] that's to the Jews
[27:17] redemptions to us yeah amen they won't
[27:20] even take it and try to explain it get
[27:22] in the cooling room and break it down
[27:23] for the people why Hebrews 42 they
[27:26] haven't mixed it with faith right Amen
[27:28] brother faithless much is what it is
[27:31] amen so order and you know I was reading
[27:33] in the fifth seal do you know that
[27:35] Joseph when he was sitting there put his
[27:37] brothers in order
[27:41] because Joseph which they didn't know
[27:43] was Joseph I know is that right they
[27:45] didn't know it was his brother they
[27:46] didn't know what they didn't even
[27:47] identified yet he put them right in the
[27:51] order of their birth right right and
[27:53] they Marvel because they were an orders
[27:55] don't tell Joseph's the perfect type of
[27:56] crime man right if he don't want you in
[27:58] order why did Joseph put his brothers in
[28:00] order right do you see what I'm saying
[28:03] so what happens is we say well you know
[28:06] it's the grace age
[28:08] well look brother Ram explained the
[28:10] difference in law and Grace is everybody
[28:12] agreed remember I said the lawyers
[28:14] you're going out on the highway It says
[28:15] 55 miles an hour right Grace is that you
[28:19] do 55 miles an hour Grace is not that
[28:22] you do 60 right
[28:26] so what is Grace it's the Fulfillment of
[28:29] the law right man right what was Jesus
[28:32] he was graced to that generation he was
[28:35] the Fulfillment of the law right sure
[28:38] what was our Prophet to this generation
[28:40] that's right Grace what was he doing he
[28:42] was absolutely fulfilling the law all
[28:44] right man Amen brother Brown never did
[28:46] away with the law never never never did
[28:49] he
[28:51] matter of fact he made it so vivid and
[28:53] so real to me when I read Ruth I see me
[28:56] there right amen when I see the children
[28:58] of Israel going across the desert I see
[29:00] me there right everywhere I read in the
[29:02] Old Testament I put my name in there is
[29:04] that what you do all right that's right
[29:05] why because I have such faith I have
[29:08] Grace it's just been right there's so
[29:10] much of it I'm identified with right
[29:12] amen so conduct order is important and
[29:16] this is what I've been preaching at the
[29:18] church now Doctrine right right the
[29:20] doctrine is Jesus Christ is that right
[29:22] right so I'm not going to skirt around
[29:24] Daniel 70 weeks I if I see something
[29:27] where where quoting a message looks like
[29:29] here and there it's saying something
[29:31] different you know what I do I start
[29:33] praying yep I'll say God your Prophet
[29:36] could not contradict himself amen this
[29:39] man could not bring in God's Not the
[29:42] author of confusion God don't say one
[29:44] thing here and another thing there right
[29:46] and if brother Brandon was going to
[29:47] change what he said then he'd have said
[29:49] it over here when I preached in 54 I
[29:51] just preach what Larkin said I preach
[29:54] what Uriah Smith said what Brethren
[29:56] preaching this seals was not a
[29:58] plagiarism it was not Uriah Smith it was
[30:01] not what Larkin preached right if you
[30:03] think that you better go read it again
[30:04] you don't have faith a revelation what
[30:08] our Prophet preached out to see him
[30:09] that's right there are people now on the
[30:11] internet saying he plagiarized them no
[30:13] he did when he preached the seals he did
[30:15] not plagiarize
[30:17] he had the Thunders the Mysteries that
[30:19] was contained in those days amen Larkin
[30:22] didn't have it none of the church age
[30:23] Messengers had right our Prophet did not
[30:26] plagiarize no you had thus said
[30:29] what I want to get on today is the
[30:31] doctrine okay and I noticed that I look
[30:34] at the internet okay and I know he's
[30:36] been preaching in the Book of
[30:37] Revelations that's what I've been doing
[30:39] I actually called up to order a doctor
[30:41] and I preached to it you get the middle
[30:43] of the book it says questions answers on
[30:45] the seals so I sat down I said okay now
[30:48] I gotta stop and I need to go over the
[30:49] seals again because we had some new
[30:51] people in church and I got to thank you
[30:53] well if it seals blend in with the
[30:54] church ages right we are not going to
[30:56] understand the church ages if you don't
[30:58] get they know or the seals if you don't
[30:59] get there in your 70 weeks so what did I
[31:01] do I started doing it book a revelation
[31:03] all right that's what you got to do as a
[31:05] preacher right you get new people in you
[31:06] just have to hit it again keep going
[31:08] keep going so I reached on the church
[31:10] ages I preached on Daniel 70 weeks uh I
[31:13] preach on the fifth uh chapter of
[31:16] Revelations right Planet Redemption is
[31:18] that what brother fourth chapter Rebel
[31:20] it's the Rapture right right then we go
[31:23] into six one through eight one is the
[31:24] seals right that's where I've been I've
[31:26] been doing it since I was here the last
[31:28] time I was in a breach when I was here
[31:30] last time now I've gone I'm I'm into
[31:32] fifth seal so I'm gonna take them past
[31:35] the fifth seal today I may mention some
[31:37] things on The Sixth Seal but I've done
[31:38] some stuff I haven't mentioned some
[31:39] things on the seventh but that's where I
[31:42] want to take you to okay and one thing
[31:45] that come up I said I just went to hear
[31:47] a preacher preach uh around Bartlesville
[31:49] London Bartlesville but I heard a
[31:51] preacher preach okay and uh
[31:54] we were talking and I I was in the first
[31:56] seal and I said well I said the seals
[31:59] open Brother Band said the seals open on
[32:02] Earth he said in the breach he said it
[32:03] was open in heaven yeah right and we
[32:05] were talking and he took the stand it
[32:07] was open to Heaven I didn't say it was a
[32:08] little nerve yeah right and I got to
[32:10] thinking well either a were both wrong B
[32:14] one of us is wrong one of us is right
[32:16] yeah we're both right yeah right there's
[32:19] something so I went back I said Lord
[32:21] what tell me what how could brother
[32:24] Randy the breach say it was open in
[32:25] heaven and he did take the quotes and
[32:28] say if I'm not saying the truth right
[32:30] and then he turns around and says well
[32:32] in the first day it's open on Earth is
[32:34] that right so there has to be a
[32:36] revelation in that right right you're
[32:38] going to have to mix faith in there to
[32:40] get those two quotes
[32:43] amen so see that's what we have in the
[32:46] message among some of the ministers now
[32:48] they're they're they're they're going
[32:50] just goofy doctrines I don't know how
[32:53] else to say it okay what is it they
[32:55] don't have Revelations what it is they
[32:58] we've had quote quotas we've had Jehovah
[33:01] Witness they're readers right we got all
[33:04] sorts of preachers can read the quotes
[33:05] right right
[33:07] you said that and I'll never forget that
[33:09] bugs me all the time certain things
[33:12] somebody hit really strikes a chord with
[33:13] me and I can't get away from it I'm like
[33:15] a Pit Bull with a bone okay once I get
[33:18] the bone it's going to take some time
[33:19] for me you to pull it away from me but I
[33:21] thought about what she said it's true
[33:23] what we got among the message is a bunch
[33:25] of Jehovah Witnesses yeah right the
[33:27] readers they can read the quotes but
[33:30] they don't have any faith in what
[33:31] they're reading right so they read a
[33:33] quote over here and later on they read a
[33:35] quote on the first seal over here this
[33:37] seal sounds like it contradicts that
[33:38] seal now we've got a big confusion chaos
[33:41] going on in the message we got this
[33:43] preacher says well this is what I
[33:45] believe it means this is what I believe
[33:47] it means why don't they ask God for a
[33:49] revelation there's where we need to get
[33:52] as a Ministry but what we do is in our
[33:54] own natural cells we're know-it-alls oh
[33:57] yeah right you know scripture says in
[33:59] the last days there'll be heady
[34:01] high-minded lovers and pleasure more
[34:02] left heading high-minded Brethren says
[34:04] know it all right now I believe I am but
[34:07] know it all right spiritually speaking
[34:09] Yeah
[34:09] does everybody understand right now now
[34:12] let me let me let me go back because
[34:15] you're going to kind of go crazy on me
[34:17] here people hear this on the internet
[34:18] are I believe I know yeah right I
[34:21] believe I have a revelation and I
[34:24] believe I'm spot on with my Revelation
[34:25] and you're going to have to move me off
[34:27] from it right
[34:31] job had a revelation and you couldn't
[34:34] move him up from right he said I know my
[34:37] redeemer limit right that woman said I
[34:39] know you're the Messiah
[34:41] something describes the Pharisees didn't
[34:43] have right what was it I know is a
[34:45] revelation amen did you know that's what
[34:48] a revelation is it's something that you
[34:50] know do you have any physical proof of
[34:53] it no
[34:55] and yes you're right brother it's both
[34:58] ways just like brother random said this
[35:00] okay when Brethren made this statement
[35:02] said worry causes cancer we didn't have
[35:04] any proof of that right but I believed
[35:06] it right because why I received a
[35:09] prophet I believe what brother Brahm
[35:10] said was right right and I heard here
[35:13] three or four years in science they said
[35:14] worry causes cancer
[35:16] if it's the true science it will agree
[35:19] with what your ideas exactly so you're
[35:22] right faith is a substance it is real is
[35:24] that right amen so he's right it's both
[35:27] right you understand what I'm saying
[35:29] Faith brings him on the scene right it's
[35:32] impossible to please God without faith
[35:35] amen amen what is Faith it's a
[35:37] revelation glory is that right amen so
[35:40] when we
[35:43] I know the church changes yeah right
[35:46] you're not going to move me off from it
[35:48] right I know Daniel 70 weeks by a
[35:51] revelation
[35:52] I know the seals by a revelation right
[35:55] that's right I know the godhead by
[35:57] Revelation everything I know is by
[35:59] Revelation amen without it you can't
[36:02] please God exactly and what is a
[36:04] revelation these people had a revelation
[36:06] what was it they knew right and they
[36:08] could say I know right the Roman
[36:11] Centurion and I'm gonna paraphrase it
[36:12] but this is really what he was saying he
[36:14] said I know right yeah I know you being
[36:16] a man said I know rather man paraphrased
[36:19] it that way if you heard that I know
[36:21] that if you'll speak the word my serpent
[36:23] back home will be real why he had a
[36:25] revelation right is that right the woman
[36:28] that had an issue for 12 years wasn't it
[36:31] she said I know if I can touch the him
[36:34] of His Garment I'll be healed what did
[36:36] she have a revelation see there's no
[36:39] such prevailing powers of Revelation
[36:41] you have a revelation ask what you will
[36:44] and it will be given unto you right ask
[36:47] what you will
[36:49] count on this guy to do all of our
[36:50] praying yeah right to do it all when are
[36:52] you going to grow up all right amen
[36:54] right when are you going to speak now
[36:57] say the third goal is just for the
[36:59] preachers the third pool was for sister
[37:02] how you write amen you know what she did
[37:04] when he sat there and told her that he
[37:07] spoke squirrels into existence was there
[37:08] any Scripture well Moses did it so she
[37:11] must have she must have knew well if
[37:13] Moses can do it brother Reynold can do
[37:15] it too he's a prophet like an unto most
[37:16] she had a revelation of who that man was
[37:19] right and she said that ain't nothing
[37:21] but the truth in other words she was
[37:23] saying I know that's the truth right
[37:26] exactly and by her knowing did God come
[37:28] down in that room and said ask what you
[37:30] will and I'll give it to you exactly
[37:33] right right you know what's going to
[37:35] break God on the scene of Revelation
[37:37] if you got the got the right Revelation
[37:40] ask what you will and it will be
[37:42] convenience because how can your
[37:44] conscience continue when your
[37:46] revelation's right right you know what
[37:48] your conscience gets all crazy about is
[37:50] when your faith gets all messed up and
[37:52] you well doesn't mean this well doesn't
[37:54] mean that and then the confusion comes
[37:56] in right yeah in a minute I'm gonna get
[37:58] on the first seal a little bit and
[37:59] explain to you what happened there a lot
[38:01] okay so like I say I'm gonna try to take
[38:04] you on a little journey here can I do
[38:06] that and we're going to go through but I
[38:08] want to get back to what the preachers
[38:09] said
[38:10] so he said well it was open in heaven
[38:12] right so let's show the slide when I
[38:15] showed what the seals are in three forms
[38:16] okay I've got a mess up here just a
[38:19] minute
[38:21] if you get it there
[38:23] uh let me see what he's got my notes
[38:25] Here I dropped it and got them all
[38:26] messed up so I put numbers on my pages
[38:32] I've dropped things and it's like really
[38:34] now what am I gonna do you know but yeah
[38:38] the first slide
[38:39] go go the first slide brother
[38:41] Joseph
[38:43] is he awake back there everybody yeah
[38:45] you know where he put him to sleep
[38:47] I want to give you a look faith is a
[38:49] complete confidence rather I said
[38:51] confidence is love right yeah you know
[38:53] if you have confidence in your wife you
[38:54] love her you don't conferences trust
[38:56] trust right you don't you don't like I
[38:58] said like if you love your wife you
[39:00] trust her right man right my wife takes
[39:02] care of my when I was at work and I
[39:03] didn't even know what I made
[39:05] all I told her was look I want to eat
[39:07] out lunch every day and I want my diet
[39:09] coke money yeah as long as I got that we
[39:11] were fine but if I ever go to the ATM
[39:13] machine I can't get that we're in deep
[39:15] trouble so she she did that I was okay
[39:19] right I had confidence here all right
[39:22] complete confidence in someone or
[39:24] something right what is Faith confidence
[39:26] in God what is it that's your love for
[39:29] you amen faith is your love if you have
[39:32] faith in God if you have confidence you
[39:34] love me right right without faith how
[39:37] can you love God you can't do it right
[39:38] right
[39:40] strong belief in God based on spiritual
[39:43] understanding is everybody who looked up
[39:46] understanding and knowledge same word
[39:48] right it's hardly a bit off remember the
[39:51] gifts remember the nine spiritual gifts
[39:53] faith
[39:55] knowledge wisdom yeah right right
[39:58] everybody that had Faith they said I
[40:00] know that's knowledge right right so
[40:02] what were they when they say it well I
[40:03] know I know this I know that script
[40:06] finally the apostles one day in the
[40:07] first sealed programs that they woke up
[40:09] and they realized they said we know that
[40:12] you know all things amen what do they
[40:15] have a face right they knew that he knew
[40:17] all things what made Jesus so Above the
[40:20] Rest he knew all things right he knew is
[40:24] that right exactly and then finally the
[40:26] apostles come to the understanding that
[40:28] he knew and they said we know that that
[40:31] you know all things right now that's a
[40:34] powerful statement right you see the
[40:36] power that he gave the Apostle when he
[40:38] said go out two by two the healings well
[40:41] they said okay it's going to happen why
[40:43] because they knew they had confidence in
[40:44] what he said right is that right that's
[40:47] what faith brings confidence amen it
[40:49] brings an I know it's not well I think
[40:51] so yeah like brother M said what's the
[40:54] sales room he said you ain't got far
[40:56] coming right you ain't what I think it's
[41:00] the faith that you have that's what
[41:02] brings the I know right so without faith
[41:04] we don't know we're just probing right
[41:06] that's what we have among the ministry a
[41:08] bunch of rumors
[41:11] they're just probing here probing
[41:13] they're trying to come up with an answer
[41:15] they don't know where they're at right
[41:16] exactly you'll never hit the target like
[41:18] that that's right
[41:19] it says based on spiritual understanding
[41:22] rather than proof right but you're right
[41:24] brother sometimes you have proof he
[41:26] could be both ways is that right sure
[41:28] and so the seals what you got to do if
[41:31] you're going to understand the seals
[41:33] you've got to understand and I I added
[41:35] I'm gonna be honest I added a form in
[41:37] their mystery form brother Brown I've
[41:39] got the quotes brother Adam talks about
[41:40] symbol form and reality form right right
[41:43] does everybody agree with that oh man
[41:44] now I'm going to tell you I put in
[41:46] mystery form yeah
[41:48] I want to try to bring some
[41:49] understanding with what he said can I do
[41:51] that right and remember the guy said it
[41:53] was open in heaven I said it was open on
[41:55] Earth
[41:56] right right and so I thought well
[41:58] there's there's got to be something here
[42:00] that I'm missing right right and since
[42:02] I'm back God showed me this he probably
[42:05] showed this to you a long time ago he's
[42:06] looking at me like you've done me
[42:09] I am
[42:10] I tell them at church here the other day
[42:13] I used to be in the I.T world we would
[42:16] go out and work on something we'd come
[42:17] back and they'd say what's wrong we'd
[42:19] say id10t
[42:34] and so we'd all laugh about it you know
[42:37] what I mean well that's the way I feel
[42:39] sometime like I'm an id10t right but
[42:42] God's going to get it to me he's wrong
[42:44] suffering toward me right toward us
[42:46] where it is that right he's going to get
[42:48] you the Revelation in the hour that you
[42:50] need it right so don't sit around and
[42:52] threaten or your friend or hate
[42:53] Revelation right don't fret and worry
[42:56] about it yeah brother rap said if you
[42:57] read something in the message and you
[43:00] don't understand it put it on a shelf
[43:02] right in other words don't throw it away
[43:05] you put it on a shelf and you say God
[43:07] you reveal that to me with an honest
[43:10] heart this man will come through in a
[43:11] day or two but maybe it's six months
[43:13] from now he'll preach and go Ah that's
[43:16] what it was what an id10t right yeah you
[43:19] know have you ever done that we do that
[43:20] as preachers I've read stuff many times
[43:23] and finally God gives you the Revelation
[43:24] what's he doing he's giving you the
[43:26] Revelation in the day that you need it
[43:28] right he's not going to give you one
[43:30] minute before that he's going to meet
[43:33] your grace is sufficient for all your
[43:35] needs I just want to meet your needs
[43:38] okay so brother random talked about a
[43:40] symbol form is that right something that
[43:42] represents something else a shadow or a
[43:45] type then I say mystery form and I put
[43:48] the word Thunders there does everybody
[43:50] understand the Thunders were the
[43:51] Mysteries that was contained under the
[43:53] seals is that what it was about it right
[43:55] so it's a religious truth not fully
[43:57] understood or eludes understanding right
[43:59] you can't figure it out with your own
[44:01] little right Canary burning right right
[44:03] you just can't figure it out right that
[44:05] was the mystery form the reality form of
[44:07] the state of being true a fact of
[44:09] certainly reality is that which when you
[44:11] stop believing in it doesn't go away
[44:13] right
[44:14] it's the truth whether you believe it or
[44:17] not it's the truth all right I don't
[44:20] care what you think about this it's the
[44:22] truth right you believe it or these guys
[44:24] out there not believing it it still is a
[44:26] reality I am right does everybody
[44:28] understand that how you try to explain
[44:31] it away they can do whatever they want
[44:33] with the seals but it will never go away
[44:35] right it's reality to me exactly sure
[44:38] what is the word real means truth you
[44:40] understand if something's the truth it's
[44:42] the truth it's the truth amen and like I
[44:45] say I'll stand there you're gonna have
[44:46] to move me off from right okay so let's
[44:49] go to the slide now brother Brian I'm uh
[44:52] where is it uh
[44:55] let's go to the fourth side
[44:58] yeah go to the fourth slide and then the
[45:00] fifth side number four Brother Joseph
[45:03] then when the lamb took the book and
[45:05] broke that first seal God spoke from his
[45:07] eternal Throne to say what that seal was
[45:10] to be revealed but when it's placed
[45:12] before John it was a nice symbol right
[45:15] right look John was told John write what
[45:18] you see amen all right right is that
[45:20] what he said and the four living
[45:22] creatures what did they say come and see
[45:24] right they didn't say coming here did
[45:27] that the all four of those beasts said
[45:29] come and see all right man right so it's
[45:32] John wrote what he saw right so what
[45:36] John wrote was in symbol form of what
[45:38] the seals were right okay
[45:41] pull this place before John is a symbol
[45:44] when John saw you it was still a mystery
[45:46] why it wasn't even revealed right then
[45:49] right it cannot be revealed until what
[45:52] he said here at the end time exactly
[45:54] that's when the mystery is going to be
[45:56] made on in the end time is that right
[45:59] okay but it come in a symbol when the
[46:03] Thunder remember a loud clapping noise
[46:04] with thunder is the voice of God Amen
[46:06] everybody that's what the Bible said see
[46:10] a clap of Thunder they thought it was a
[46:12] thunder but it was God he understood it
[46:15] or it was revealed to him see it was a
[46:18] Thunderman okay
[46:21] and notice the first seal opened the
[46:24] first seal when it was open in the
[46:25] symbol form it thundered actually now
[46:28] what about when it's open in its reality
[46:30] for it brother Bam's using reality as a
[46:33] mystery okay but the reason I'm gonna
[46:35] break it down even further I want to
[46:36] show you something okay so when it was
[46:39] open in mystery form right wouldn't it
[46:42] thunder again when the first seal and
[46:44] the Mystery of it so it wouldn't it
[46:46] thunder again right that's what brother
[46:48] branham's asking in the first seal right
[46:50] okay it thundered as soon as the M lamb
[46:53] struck back the seal right and what did
[46:55] it reveal not all of itself exactly
[46:59] yep
[47:00] right all right first it's with God next
[47:03] it's in a symbol then it's revealed
[47:04] three things right is that right C it's
[47:08] coming forth from the throne first it
[47:11] can't be seen heard or nothing it's
[47:13] sealed out all right amen right
[47:15] the Lamb's blood paid the price it
[47:18] thundered when he spoke it out and when
[47:20] he did a white horse rider started out
[47:22] and it still was assembled that's what
[47:25] it is is that right with that white
[47:27] horse rider went out it was in symbol
[47:30] form right nobody nobody Larkin Uriah
[47:33] even brother Brigham in 1954 could not
[47:37] put the word Antichrist with the White
[47:39] Horse brother Adam said the White Horse
[47:41] that went out was the Holy Spirit right
[47:43] now did he plagiarize Uriah Smith then
[47:45] yes and Larkin yes in 54. 63 he did not
[47:50] plagiarize right so the fellow that's
[47:52] saying out on the internet needs to get
[47:54] saved he needs to get some things he
[47:57] needs to get to Hebrew for two because
[48:00] why it shows me he heard the message he
[48:04] has an intellectual conception of the
[48:05] message but somewhere your intellect
[48:08] will run out people if you're sitting
[48:10] here in this congregation with an
[48:13] intellectual conception of this message
[48:15] somewhere you will fall away you better
[48:19] ask God for a revelation right necessary
[48:23] man you need to pray for revelation
[48:29] that's what we failed to do in the
[48:31] message churches we come and we hear it
[48:33] we wrap our intellect around it but we
[48:36] don't get a spiritual Revelation from
[48:38] God Amen until it comes a spiritual
[48:40] Revelation from God they can a preacher
[48:42] can preach it away from you right
[48:44] exactly sure right right
[48:47] somebody will take your intellect away
[48:50] right but if you get a revelation of
[48:52] something it's a rock it's established
[48:54] it's a foundation amen and you can put
[48:57] your soul on that amen and amen damn it
[49:00] I'm not mad by the way sometimes it
[49:02] looks like I'm preaching mad but I'm
[49:03] really not yeah okay
[49:06] let's go to the fifth slide
[49:10] now I'm watching he said it would be
[49:12] known in the last day
[49:15] but it comes forth in a church Samurai
[49:17] exactly right
[49:20] do you understand that church it comes
[49:22] forth in a symbol of a church that they
[49:25] know there is a seal but just what it is
[49:28] yet they don't know right see no they
[49:32] don't know they don't have a knowledge
[49:33] of it I know all right amen you can say
[49:36] I know that you can say hopefully most
[49:38] of you in here can say I know by a
[49:40] revelation not by intellect by a
[49:42] revelation that God has given you right
[49:44] amen God ever gives you that Revelation
[49:46] I'll tell you it will not depart from
[49:48] you right have you ever got a revelation
[49:51] I don't know I don't know people still
[49:53] have sent the message for 40 years and
[49:55] still smoking yeah yeah I'm gonna be
[49:57] honest with you if you've got a
[49:58] revelation smoke is wrong you'll quit
[50:00] right the reason you continue to smoke
[50:02] because you don't have a revelation
[50:03] exactly the reason you continue to paint
[50:05] your face you don't have a Runway the
[50:08] reason you continue drink a little here
[50:10] tell a little dirty joke here you don't
[50:12] have a revelation if you've got a
[50:14] revelation you're going to stop the
[50:16] nonsense right you're going to get in
[50:18] the end of the Jubilee statement you've
[50:21] got a revelation because you know that
[50:23] that shout was the absolute it was thus
[50:26] saith the Lord and you're going to get
[50:28] your conduct right right amen amen
[50:31] thought simply put there's a lot of
[50:33] people sitting in a message churches
[50:35] don't have a revelation right
[50:37] that's why brother Adam said you need to
[50:38] pray for him more than anything
[50:40] exactly what do you think he said that
[50:41] for just to throw words out there no
[50:43] it's the truth
[50:47] they don't know because it's a white
[50:49] horse rider and it only is to be
[50:52] revealed at the last day with this
[50:54] actual seal is broken right broken to
[50:57] who not to Christ but to the church
[50:59] notice now oh my that just makes me
[51:02] tremble I hope that the church truly
[51:04] understands it right amen see what I
[51:07] mean you people I'm going to call you
[51:09] Brian
[51:10] do you know what the opening of the
[51:12] Thunder the Thunders or what
[51:14] is what church do a prize what is it
[51:17] that's going to take you from a church
[51:18] to a bride Revelation exactly
[51:21] does everybody understand that man he's
[51:23] what he's saying here I'm not going to
[51:25] call you church anymore right that's
[51:28] right and now what am I am I can I mix
[51:31] this with a little faith amen I mean
[51:34] people get up and read it all the time
[51:35] and they don't give a faith of it don't
[51:37] give people any faith at all it's just a
[51:38] quote Yeah I want to give you more to
[51:40] quote I'm going to give you the
[51:41] revelation of what the quote is amen can
[51:43] I read between the lines of Brother Brad
[51:44] said I could why because I love him I
[51:47] have confidence in him I have confidence
[51:49] in this message I don't believe there
[51:51] I'll be honest with you if Moses was
[51:54] told to Smite the rock or to speak to
[51:56] the rocket he smote it
[51:57] do you think God's gonna let Moses that
[52:00] if if a prophet went to the mailbox that
[52:03] meant something right God had to stand
[52:05] behind Moses does everybody understand
[52:07] that all right brother Rand said right
[52:09] Brethren said that when he smoked a rock
[52:12] God that's why Jesus had to be crucified
[52:14] the second time exactly on the
[52:16] conference room tables right now I'm
[52:18] gonna say something here okay okay yes
[52:21] have you ever thought of this I'm gonna
[52:23] I'm gonna put it out here okay I'm gonna
[52:25] say I know I believe I really do if I'm
[52:27] wrong you tell me do you realize Daniel
[52:29] 69th week ended When They Crucified him
[52:32] right now
[52:36] that's right right at the end of the
[52:38] 69th week you know Jesus was crucified
[52:41] it was over he quit dealing with Israel
[52:43] as a nation right right you agree with
[52:46] that right what happens when the Hat
[52:48] came up on a conference room table did
[52:49] he quit dealing with him as a church the
[52:51] church ages I say he did absolutely yeah
[52:54] you see what I'm saying what did Brandon
[52:56] start preaching after that the bride age
[52:58] right
[52:58] why they hacked him up God don't deal
[53:01] with the churches anymore exactly he
[53:03] deals with the bride right
[53:06] when they were crucified When They
[53:08] Crucified him back there God did not
[53:10] deal with Israel as a nation right but
[53:13] there were individuals yeah sure that he
[53:15] saved all the way through the churches
[53:18] no that's not my fault you go read it
[53:21] that's his quote right so when we say it
[53:23] God don't deal with Israel as a nation
[53:26] as a nation that's true but did he deal
[53:29] with the individuals out of there
[53:30] Brethren said all through the church
[53:32] ages there's people that come to Christ
[53:33] and come to the testimony out of it sure
[53:35] right he said I didn't right the 12
[53:38] apostles
[53:39] were they were they bright sure
[53:45] why because they God didn't deal with
[53:47] him as a nation all right he dealt with
[53:49] them once they crucified him he quit
[53:52] dealing with him as a nation right once
[53:55] once Jesus was caught up on her
[53:57] conference room tables he quit dealing
[53:59] with them as a church right absolutely
[54:01] right right so you can tell all the
[54:03] people in Georgia you come to the church
[54:05] at Eula big deal yeah
[54:07] don't mean a thing yeah right but if you
[54:11] tell him you're bride amen there's the
[54:14] difference man amen right right because
[54:15] what the bride says is God has dealt
[54:18] with you as an individual right God
[54:21] don't deal with the Lula trust right
[54:23] that's right God damn it individuals
[54:27] amen he quit dealing with the church
[54:30] ages he was locked outside the door
[54:34] tried to not to come in amen what God
[54:37] deals with is individuals set in this
[54:40] church that's why I'm telling you you
[54:42] gotta have a personal revelation you
[54:46] have to sit there and say I know you're
[54:50] gonna have to be just like the woman at
[54:51] the well you're gonna have to be just
[54:53] like job you're gonna have to be like
[54:55] that Roman Centurion right no such great
[54:58] faith that I've seen in all of Israel
[55:00] why because he knew he had a revelation
[55:04] right that's what this bride has to come
[55:07] to is the Revelation is the mystery
[55:10] that's contained under the seal right
[55:12] and those Mysteries there's what's going
[55:15] to give you rapture
[55:18] and if you're not going to take a
[55:19] Rapture without saying I know the
[55:22] Mysteries that was contained under the
[55:25] seal you're not gonna probe at it you're
[55:28] not gonna guess you're gonna have thus
[55:31] saith the Lord
[55:33] Glory that's right does everybody
[55:35] understand amen
[55:37] okay you turned that off didn't you
[55:40] I guess I went to Yaki yak
[55:44] okay it's back okay where did I end
[55:47] I'm going to call you bribe that you'll
[55:49] understand it right he's bringing the
[55:52] knowledge to you right everybody
[55:53] understand it he's bringing I know I
[55:55] know to the bride right all that look
[55:58] all the lucians are being taken away now
[56:00] right amen we're gonna know brother
[56:02] right the justification as if I never
[56:04] done it I can't preach that
[56:07] did you know that can you preach that as
[56:10] if I never done it yeah I can't that's
[56:12] part word yeah that one with that which
[56:15] is perfect is come that which is in part
[56:17] is done away all right do you agree with
[56:20] that amen Luther preached as if I never
[56:22] died right now we found out under the
[56:24] seals we never did it right under the
[56:26] first seal brother Rand said I never did
[56:28] it right I can't preach to you as if I
[56:31] never done it right
[56:32] I'm going to preach to you you never did
[56:34] it little guy you never ever did it do
[56:38] you understand exactly so quit fret and
[56:40] quit worrying take the worry and the
[56:43] doubt out of this thing and start saying
[56:45] I know I'm proud I know I am the Rapture
[56:49] I know I got the right I know I got the
[56:51] right you ought to start you should
[56:53] start saying I know people worry the
[56:56] fear the doubt ought to come out
[57:01] voice is a thunder amen The Voice came
[57:04] from where from the throne where the
[57:06] lamb had just left as intersections
[57:08] right amen right man hey I'm going to be
[57:12] honest with you he came
[57:14] in the first church age
[57:17] see people are putting that way back
[57:19] here they're missing it yeah
[57:21] right after coming's all wrong right
[57:23] right isn't that what describes the
[57:25] Pharisees had by their Revelation they
[57:27] thought he was going to come on a white
[57:29] horse right in Kick Caesar out and they
[57:31] were going to take over at it yeah you
[57:33] know what the prime minister's in the
[57:34] message they got the Cummings wrong yeah

[58:13] going to tell you my approach to things
[58:16] amen which is not any revelation's the
[58:18] same right I mean continuity is the same

[59:34] secret the mystery coming can I say it

[59:38] that's not a secret coming right on the
[59:41] day of Pentecost there were three
[59:42] thousand standing there right right yeah

[59:46] mystery was that all right but down here
[59:48] it's a mystery coming right right in
[59:51] this hour right okay all right we'll get
[59:53] there here in a minute the Thunder where
[59:55] the lamb had left the father's Throne to
[59:56] go take his own through no glory now now
[59:58] don't miss it friends we all know as
[1:00:00] Christians that God swore to David that
[1:00:02] he would raise up Christ said on his
[1:00:03] throne and give him an everlasting
[1:00:05] kingdom here on Earth right
[1:00:08] remember everybody remember Matthew 6.
[1:00:11] thy kingdom come you know where brother
[1:00:13] Brandon preached at
[1:00:14] Souls that are imprisoned now do you
[1:00:16] know what souls in prison now is third
[1:00:18] bull yeah right you know what the third
[1:00:20] pool is Matthew 6 that little bitty
[1:00:22] verses right thy kingdom come thy will
[1:00:25] be done in earth right as it is
[1:00:29] a third pool was Matthew 6. so you go
[1:00:32] look and see if brother you know that
[1:00:35] right amen that is the third pool
[1:00:37] Matthew 6 that little bitty verse that
[1:00:39] we all say as kids growing up it's
[1:00:41] talking about the third pull all right
[1:00:43] but we didn't come to the understanding
[1:00:44] or the mystery of knowing that until
[1:00:46] this time
[1:00:48] I'm sure happy I understand I like
[1:00:50] Matthew 60. I enjoy quoting it when I
[1:00:53] was a kid now I have a revelation I have
[1:00:56] the mystery of who I've been quoting I
[1:00:58] ain't just quoting quotes right yeah do
[1:01:02] this sister thank you for me be with me
[1:01:04] now she is I'm giving her a hard time
[1:01:06] right we're not just floating clothes
[1:01:09] right we're talking about the mystery
[1:01:11] the revelation of that quote that that
[1:01:13] Passage scripture was the third call
[1:01:16] right amen okay
[1:01:18] Glory now now don't miss it friends we
[1:01:22] all know as Christians we all know right
[1:01:25] is that what it says all right so if I
[1:01:27] say I know there's a bug in anybody okay
[1:01:30] exactly what it was saying amen we all
[1:01:33] know as Christians that God swear to
[1:01:35] David that he would raise up Christ to
[1:01:37] sit on his throne and give him an
[1:01:38] everlasting kingdom here on Earth he did
[1:01:40] it and Jesus said he that overcomes the
[1:01:42] Antichrist right
[1:01:45] now the first seal is the Antichrist
[1:01:46] does everybody understand that
[1:01:49] did we know it before Brethren preached
[1:01:51] the first seal
[1:01:52] show me any passage of scripture
[1:01:54] that are Christ with the White Horse you
[1:01:57] can't do it no we understand that when
[1:02:00] John went up he wrote what he saw right
[1:02:02] and when that Beast said come and see he
[1:02:04] wrote a white horse right has anybody
[1:02:06] ever and I know you have that's I
[1:02:08] shouldn't say it but I'm gonna say have
[1:02:09] you read lately first John second John
[1:02:12] third John the Little John's that's the
[1:02:14] only place Antichrist has met you right
[1:02:16] right you know that was written after he
[1:02:18] wrote the Book of Revelation amen
[1:02:20] sure now I'm going to tell you something
[1:02:22] he John was told don't you write what
[1:02:24] the Thunder's under right is that what
[1:02:27] he said so in the Book of Revelation he
[1:02:29] never put Antichrist
[1:02:31] with that white horse rider he never
[1:02:33] nobody could connect the dots does
[1:02:35] anybody got what I'm saying all right
[1:02:36] look when John come back and preach the
[1:02:38] Little John's he said Antichrist four
[1:02:41] times that's the only place go look in
[1:02:42] your Bible put the word Antichrist the
[1:02:45] only time you'll find is one two and
[1:02:46] three right so he had a revelation when
[1:02:49] he went over there he seed the White
[1:02:51] Horse was what yeah that of Christ so he
[1:02:55] wrote it a little John but he never
[1:02:56] connected it to the White Horse
[1:03:03] Smith couldn't connect the dog right
[1:03:05] you're right Smith couldn't connect the
[1:03:07] dot brother Branham couldn't connect the
[1:03:09] dots right why the seal the mystery of
[1:03:14] those symbols had to be open in this
[1:03:16] hour right for us to say I know right
[1:03:20] right I'm not guessing what the seals
[1:03:23] are right man I know I know the symbol
[1:03:27] for him I know the reality form I know
[1:03:30] the mystery form amen and I'm not being
[1:03:33] I know people who are here and said on
[1:03:34] the internet like this is a know-it-all
[1:03:36] but you ought to look if I just proceeds
[1:03:39] to use scripture after scripture says
[1:03:41] they already said I know right I know I
[1:03:44] know I know shouldn't we be able to say
[1:03:46] in this hour shouldn't our Revelation be
[1:03:49] so fixed right that we can say I'm right
[1:03:52] amen amen and you know when you say that
[1:03:55] in a room full of creatures they get
[1:03:56] upset
[1:04:00] right you go say I know what Daniel's 70
[1:04:03] weeks is they go who do you think you
[1:04:04] are yeah if I was to say a little Canary
[1:04:08] brain like me I said I know what they
[1:04:09] are right right what do they do they
[1:04:11] won't preach you right they're afraid
[1:04:14] you'll come and preach that now they're
[1:04:15] trying all right they won't preach you
[1:04:17] anymore because they're afraid of you
[1:04:19] right you know what I believe this if
[1:04:22] you've got something that I don't know
[1:04:24] you come and preach it I believe I
[1:04:26] Faithfully taught my congregation if I
[1:04:28] don't have any more confidence in what
[1:04:30] I'm teaching and to think somebody can
[1:04:32] bring a false Doctrine into this and
[1:04:34] fool the whole bunch and pull them away
[1:04:36] I ain't much of a teacher in Ephesians 4
[1:04:39] it says the pastor is supposed and
[1:04:41] pastor and teacher and don't separate
[1:04:42] them with a comment right you know
[1:04:44] people say I've heard him say oh this
[1:04:45] guy's a teacher so what a pastor's
[1:04:48] supposed to an Elder's supposed to be
[1:04:49] able to teach right if you're an elder
[1:04:51] in this church you're supposed to be
[1:04:52] able to teach the word right so if a
[1:04:55] pastor teaches they get they say well I
[1:04:56] doubt it's calling no no man you need to
[1:05:00] go read Ephesians 40. you do not have a
[1:05:03] revelation right that's why we get all
[1:05:05] these stupid can I say it right I told
[1:05:08] them in church you know there's a
[1:05:09] difference stupid stupid is

[1:08:29] I mean you're tough
[1:08:31] so let me get back to what the preachers
[1:08:34] we were talking about he said well I was
[1:08:35] over in heaven I said no it's on one
[1:08:36] Earth I just read the quote we were both
[1:08:39] right yeah sure absolutely look it was
[1:08:41] opened in heaven when he said come and
[1:08:43] see right it was open what was it his
[1:08:45] opening symbol for us right that's
[1:08:47] exactly does everybody agree with that
[1:08:48] man what's open and simple
[1:08:51] but it is open on Earth in mystery form
[1:08:54] right and that didn't come till this
[1:08:56] hour right does everybody understand
[1:08:58] that so look did he start doing
[1:09:00] performing the player redemption in the
[1:09:02] first church age
[1:09:03] you believe he did I do I think Paul was
[1:09:06] redeemed sure I believe there was bright
[1:09:08] out of the first thing it's the second
[1:09:09] Church age the third church I believe he
[1:09:12] come down man with an open book now
[1:09:15] that's going to blow your mind down man
[1:09:17] you mean he believes he came down very
[1:09:19] Pentecostal yep I do
[1:09:22] now I got your attention now did yeah
[1:09:26] okay I got your attention now let's go
[1:09:28] to another slide I'm gonna bring
[1:09:29] something right here and start it in
[1:09:32] I don't have it he didn't put it on here
[1:09:34] okay everybody understand the story
[1:09:36] about handle meal under Jeremiah right
[1:09:38] well let me rehearse it you Jeremiah 32
[1:09:41] yeah you agree with that right you
[1:09:43] understand Jeremiah bought his uncle's
[1:09:45] property right and it was showing him
[1:09:46] how Redemption Works does everybody
[1:09:48] agree with that right right so what did
[1:09:50] what did he do he put He bought his
[1:09:53] uncle's land it was witness right right
[1:09:56] yep it was witness he was actually
[1:09:59] Jeremiah was in prison
[1:10:01] did you know that's what he was yes he
[1:10:03] was in prison but they witnessed it and
[1:10:06] you know what he had two Scrolls made
[1:10:09] and putting one Earthen vessel yeah is
[1:10:11] everybody a president said that vessel
[1:10:13] type Christ right right exactly does
[1:10:15] everybody understand that all right man
[1:10:16] one of the Scrolls was open the other
[1:10:19] one was sealed
[1:10:20] it's showing you Redemption right right
[1:10:22] when in a day of Pentecost and I'm going
[1:10:25] to show you a quote here in a minute on
[1:10:27] the you know remember I said if the
[1:10:29] first seal had thundered when it opened
[1:10:31] its symbol for wouldn't it thunder when
[1:10:33] it only mystery formed does everybody
[1:10:35] agree with that quote right and brother
[1:10:37] Brown said the Thunders weren't even
[1:10:38] written in the Bible right does
[1:10:40] everybody agree with that I do right the
[1:10:43] mystery of it wasn't written in the
[1:10:45] Bible the simple form was right you the
[1:10:48] mystery of the white horse rider is
[1:10:50] Antichrist there's nowhere where you can
[1:10:53] put Antichrist with the white horse
[1:10:54] rider until this hour right does
[1:10:57] everybody understand exactly now look at
[1:10:59] Jeremiah look at what happened to him he
[1:11:01] bought his uncle's land he did the work
[1:11:04] of redemption do you agree right and he
[1:11:06] put in that Earthen vessel and open
[1:11:09] scroll and a closed scroll exactly is
[1:11:12] that right brother now brother may have
[1:11:14] talked about this in a breach I believe
[1:11:15] it was wasn't it so we had an open one
[1:11:18] the closed one right right that's the
[1:11:20] plan of redemption so the open one was
[1:11:22] the symbol form does everybody
[1:11:24] understand that's the type of the Old
[1:11:26] Testament the closed one was the mystery
[1:11:28] form right now Jeremiah went into
[1:11:31] bondage did you know that he hit him in
[1:11:34] Christ right then he went into bondage
[1:11:36] does everybody understand 70 years of
[1:11:38] bondage in Babylon right remember I said
[1:11:41] he was bound by the dogmas the decrees
[1:11:44] what did they do they bound the Holy
[1:11:47] Ghost is that right amen so what did he
[1:11:49] do they bound him out of the church ages
[1:11:51] do you agree with that they had part
[1:11:53] word yeah but they bound him to where
[1:11:56] the where the Holy Ghost couldn't have
[1:11:57] preeminence in the church does everybody
[1:11:59] agree with what I'm saying that's right
[1:12:01] man so what happened is same thing
[1:12:03] Jeremiah is showing the type to set
[1:12:05] forth into church ages right with the
[1:12:07] seals so it was open and simple form
[1:12:10] they could read it
[1:12:12] right but he went into captivity so
[1:12:15] during the church age where what dogmas
[1:12:18] and Creeds took over they left the
[1:12:20] original word they accepted the bridler
[1:12:23] remember I said Christ right fell by
[1:12:26] accepting what the dogless and the Creed
[1:12:28] what did they get away from the original
[1:12:31] word right right that's why brother
[1:12:33] Graham had to take us back to the
[1:12:35] original faith of the party because they
[1:12:37] left the original word right right right
[1:12:40] so it was open in simple form but when
[1:12:45] he came back from captivity when
[1:12:47] Jeremiah came back he was able to open
[1:12:50] the second one to say look in the mouth
[1:12:53] of two or three Witnesses let these
[1:12:54] things be established everybody got what
[1:12:57] I'm saying it's in there right it's in
[1:12:59] there right so what has happened in this
[1:13:03] hour he has came again right the mighty
[1:13:06] Angel has come out has descended has
[1:13:09] come down to earth and he's open ended
[1:13:12] up he was bound the only ghost what he
[1:13:15] found right he was bound he got Bound in
[1:13:18] what the thought of her age or whatever
[1:13:20] it was
[1:13:21] at 320 he got bound because why they
[1:13:24] took Dominus right instead of The
[1:13:26] Originals does everybody agree with that
[1:13:28] right so what happens is the it
[1:13:31] thundered on the first one when it was
[1:13:32] open and simple for him right does
[1:13:34] everybody agree with that amen now I'm
[1:13:37] going to tell you when that happened can
[1:13:38] I do that yeah let's go let's go to the
[1:13:41] slide I want him to see that and I know
[1:13:43] he's got that one
[1:13:46] let's go to the uh six slide if you
[1:13:49] would for the Joseph six sign
[1:13:52] I'd always thought this you know if you
[1:13:54] look at the church agents remember Paul
[1:13:55] started in 53 and everybody's show and
[1:13:58] we gotta we got a church age that
[1:14:00] somebody has and it's a good job I use
[1:14:02] it all the time this shows while the
[1:14:03] white horse riders started in 53. does
[1:14:05] everybody believe the white horse rider
[1:14:07] started in 53 oh yeah I know
[1:14:12] let me show you where it's all right
[1:14:14] look at listen to what Brendan Brandon
[1:14:16] said okay I'm asking you a question it
[1:14:19] blasted with thunder when this voice run
[1:14:21] out did you notice that with the Seven
[1:14:23] Seals that follow the seven Church ages
[1:14:25] when the first seal was open right that
[1:14:28] there was a thunder sure so let me ask
[1:14:30] you 53 if there was a thunder where are
[1:14:33] you going to put it right place that
[1:14:34] Thunder
[1:14:37] you go have a hard time right the first
[1:14:39] seal in the book was opened there was a
[1:14:42] thunder with not the first seal on the
[1:14:44] outside of the book he's talking about
[1:14:45] the Mysteries open the same way
[1:14:49] congregation says amen God doesn't
[1:14:51] change his program let's turn over to
[1:14:52] revelation 6. and I saw I saw when the
[1:14:57] lamb had opened one of the seals and I
[1:14:59] heard as it was the noise of a thunder
[1:15:02] right
[1:15:03] and one of the four beats said come and
[1:15:06] see so that Thunder it was open in
[1:15:09] symbol for him do you agree right now
[1:15:11] next slide now this is the one that I
[1:15:14] caught and I thought I like to have me a
[1:15:16] Running Fit now there was never was
[1:15:18] another Thunder and the last seal was
[1:15:20] over there was space in heaven for a
[1:15:23] half of power silence but the first seal
[1:15:26] was opened there was a blast of Thunder
[1:15:28] here oh Church could it be are we that
[1:15:31] far friends think maybe I hope it isn't
[1:15:34] but what if it is what was that blast
[1:15:36] and before God and this Open Bible Alana
[1:15:39] blast the shook the whole world that was
[1:15:42] sunset Mountain right amen I know where
[1:15:44] that went into I know where the Thunder
[1:15:46] was under those Mysteries right would
[1:15:48] have sealed the mystery part of it was
[1:15:50] open I can establish that by that quote
[1:15:53] right does everybody agree with that
[1:15:54] amen and when the first seal of the
[1:15:56] seven that was opened in the Bible it
[1:15:58] come forth just one but a blast that
[1:16:00] shook the whole thing of thunder and
[1:16:03] then at the seals that's on the back
[1:16:04] side would open wouldn't
[1:16:06] Thunder too I don't know I can't there
[1:16:09] was a thunder the first seal and the
[1:16:11] seal was Thunder the trumpet was open at
[1:16:14] that time and the trumpet was blown out
[1:16:17] that's when the thunder thunder into the
[1:16:20] first seal it was Pentecost folks is
[1:16:23] that where the church started out on a
[1:16:24] day of Pentecost brother Bradley will
[1:16:27] take us back to 53.
[1:16:28] brother man's taking us back to
[1:16:30] Pinnacles does everybody understand the
[1:16:33] first Thunder 6-1 thundered at Pentecost
[1:16:37] what happened on the day of the
[1:16:39] Pentecost the Holy Ghost come down amen
[1:16:41] the Christ the Baptist does everybody
[1:16:42] agree with that amen the Christ came
[1:16:45] what came on the same day the Antichrist
[1:16:47] sure the White Horse what was it every
[1:16:49] seal Twins were born right it was a
[1:16:52] church symbol does everybody agree I
[1:16:54] read it to you right on the day of
[1:16:56] Pentecost the Christ went out and the
[1:16:58] Antichrist right now right the
[1:17:00] Antichrist started riding on the day of
[1:17:02] Pentecost all right it thundered what
[1:17:04] was the Thunder the upper room yeah
[1:17:10] let's go to Acts 2 1.
[1:17:12] and you follow the way brother Brown
[1:17:14] says what happened in Acts okay
[1:17:17] I'm not guessing about what I say but
[1:17:19] everyone said it
[1:17:20] you see that's what he said a trumpet a
[1:17:22] thunder and it was blowing Pentecost of
[1:17:25] course I won't get into that he said but
[1:17:27] brother Brandon already established that
[1:17:29] that Thunder that happened in civil form
[1:17:32] was open on the day of Pentecost yeah
[1:17:34] right that's what he's putting it at but
[1:17:37] we and I've done the same thing I put it
[1:17:39] in 53 I'd put the white horse rider
[1:17:42] right under there no the white horse
[1:17:44] rider started on the day of Pentecost
[1:17:46] right right the Holy Ghost where did he
[1:17:49] start on the day of Pentecost every
[1:17:51] Revival there's twins born right
[1:17:53] everybody agree with that right right
[1:17:55] man this is the only quote
[1:17:58] well you got it thank you and when the
[1:18:01] day of Pentecost was fully come they
[1:18:03] were all with one Accord in one place
[1:18:05] and suddenly there came a sound all
[1:18:08] right what is the voice of God Amen
[1:18:12] and a sound come from heaven right did
[1:18:15] it thunder from the throne hey man
[1:18:18] see where it places it in the scripture
[1:18:20] we didn't know what it was brother
[1:18:22] random said it you understand amen so
[1:18:25] where did the Thunder where did the 6-1
[1:18:27] Thunder take place on the day of
[1:18:30] Pentecost
[1:18:33] that's where it started folks on the day
[1:18:36] of Pentecost
[1:18:37] right so if God's going to take us back
[1:18:40] to the original right he's going to take
[1:18:43] us back to Pentecost he's going to stop
[1:18:45] using me up at 53 A.D Paul was already
[1:18:48] telling the Antichrist is working
[1:18:49] ammonia those people were putting their
[1:18:52] fat fingers on her nose saying you ain't
[1:18:53] saying well Paul said all right exactly
[1:18:55] right what what gave him the right to do
[1:18:58] that the Holy Ghost what gives you the
[1:19:01] right to say I know all right the Holy
[1:19:03] Ghost that's what Paul and them were
[1:19:05] saying in their day I know you're not
[1:19:07] preaching what Paul preached all right
[1:19:08] right right but boy you say that now to
[1:19:10] people that say what gives you the
[1:19:12] authority I know yeah the word the
[1:19:14] message the Revelation that he's given
[1:19:16] right that's the authority that I got
[1:19:18] right man
[1:19:21] that's right and suddenly there came a
[1:19:22] sound from Heaven yeah as a rushing
[1:19:26] Mighty Wind and it filled all the house
[1:19:27] where they were saved right brother
[1:19:29] Brandon look at what he says
[1:19:31] when you go and I had other quotes I
[1:19:33] guys I got if you you couldn't stand it
[1:19:35] you would be here for days but brother
[1:19:38] Ram said it shook that Upper Room
[1:19:41] it shook it filled the house is that
[1:19:44] right the whole room where they were
[1:19:46] sitting shook what was that it was a
[1:19:49] thunder that went into that man it was
[1:19:51] the voice it was the sound that's what
[1:19:54] the Thunder is the voice of God all
[1:19:55] right so now by this quote that Brethren
[1:19:58] again we can in place where that Thunder
[1:20:01] actually physically happened does
[1:20:04] everybody agree right it's easier for me
[1:20:06] to show you where it happened in mystery
[1:20:08] form right because brother I'm saying it
[1:20:10] was on it shook on Sunset Mountain it
[1:20:12] shook the whole earth that's exactly
[1:20:14] what happened here all right man when it
[1:20:16] opened in simple form right right did it
[1:20:19] open in heaven in simple form yes before
[1:20:21] the four living creature said come and
[1:20:23] see amen so when I was talking to that
[1:20:25] preacher I thought there has to be a
[1:20:28] revelation in it right right you have to
[1:20:30] mix it with faith or you're gonna have
[1:20:33] to say brother man said here he said if
[1:20:35] they're one place he said it wrong yeah
[1:20:37] see there's the problem we have with the
[1:20:39] ministry they'll dig in they'll say no
[1:20:42] I'm right no I'm right they won't go get
[1:20:44] before God and say give me the
[1:20:46] Revelation I know I know I know brother
[1:20:50] bran was a prophet I know he couldn't
[1:20:52] contradict it right I know he couldn't
[1:20:55] bring confusion that's right because
[1:20:57] God's not the author of confusion is
[1:20:59] that right right so what was it when it
[1:21:02] thundered on a day of Pentagon it sounds
[1:21:04] from Heaven that was the first seal
[1:21:07] opening in symbol foreign
[1:21:16] it said that that seventh Church age
[1:21:18] messenger was on the earth at the time
[1:21:22] right of that
[1:21:30] who could open the Mysteries the only
[1:21:32] one that can open the mysteries of the
[1:21:34] one that gave it that's right brother
[1:21:36] Graham couldn't hold that no Prophet no
[1:21:38] Priest No team could open it no only
[1:21:40] Christ it could be and come down and
[1:21:43] open those seals he was he was bound
[1:21:46] through the church ages he could bring
[1:21:48] me part word under justification he
[1:21:50] could bring me part word under
[1:21:52] sanctification even the Baptist look
[1:21:54] this is what preachers are saying now
[1:21:57] God help us you know it's a mess isn't
[1:21:59] it preachers say okay there's no fourth
[1:22:01] stage now
[1:22:03] look I'm gonna be real I'm a simple
[1:22:06] person okay you got to get I'm a canary
[1:22:09] brain
[1:22:10] gotta get it simpler I don't get it in a
[1:22:13] natural birth there's a natural birth
[1:22:14] type to spiritual bread you got water
[1:22:17] blood and spirit
[1:22:19] you know what that water blood and
[1:22:21] spirit brings forth a little person yeah
[1:22:23] right
[1:22:23] right do you know what's happened in
[1:22:26] this hour we've had justification
[1:22:28] sanctification the baptism well you know
[1:22:30] what's wrong for a person exactly it's
[1:22:33] brought forth Christ you live it on my
[1:22:36] heart the person right amen I don't just
[1:22:38] have a dip in the Holy Ghost does
[1:22:41] everybody understand that I have the
[1:22:43] person
[1:22:44] I have the person of Jesus Christ Living
[1:22:48] in man it's Christ that lives in me
[1:22:51] right does everybody I don't have part
[1:22:54] word right I can't get away with part
[1:22:56] work God wants weight that my ignorance
[1:22:59] right but he commands every man to be
[1:23:02] made all of himself Body Spirit and soul
[1:23:06] we have to come to the fullness of the
[1:23:09] word in this hour damn it right you're
[1:23:11] not gonna get away with part words not
[1:23:15] as if you if you never did it that's the
[1:23:17] knowledge you have to contact and it's
[1:23:19] up to us preachers to preach the
[1:23:21] Mysteries the Mysteries I've never ever
[1:23:24] seen as so plain as this time going
[1:23:26] through this it's the important part
[1:23:28] it's the Mysteries right it's the
[1:23:30] Thunders that literally turn our hearts
[1:23:32] right back to the apostolic fathers amen
[1:23:35] amen does everybody agree with that
[1:23:36] that's what literally turns us back
[1:23:38] right so these preachers that are
[1:23:40] preaching they're not preaching the
[1:23:42] mystery the Thunders that were contained
[1:23:45] under the seal without it there's no
[1:23:48] rapturing thing right rapturing
[1:23:51] faith-wise in this message this message
[1:23:55] of Fame perfect faith brother random

[1:24:11] that's right the people riding the
[1:24:14] people perish not having a revelation
[1:24:17] does everybody agree with that that's
[1:24:19] what we're seeing going on in the
[1:24:20] message
[1:24:21] the people that are falling out the
[1:24:23] people that are going to go inside this
[1:24:24] one
[1:24:26] get over here they got no all right
[1:24:28] right they got no Hebrews 4-2 right they

[1:24:35] for a revelation right say God my little
[1:24:38] Canary brain don't get it I can't
[1:24:41] connect the dots but the Holy Spirit
[1:24:43] right can give you a revelation that'll
[1:24:45] connect it right amen look the Garment

[1:25:24] that we're just with a loose thread we

[1:25:31] loose Revelations

[1:25:41] mix this with Faith you have a loose
[1:25:44] thread and somebody's gonna come by and
[1:25:45] pull itself
[1:25:47] then you're gonna say well I don't help
[1:25:49] brother around him he must have been
[1:25:50] wrong
[1:25:51] that's what's happening to people the
[1:25:52] whole thing's coming unwell right if
[1:25:55] they had faith it would be United it
[1:25:58] would be mixed and they'd have a white
[1:26:00] garment look Jesus had a garment didn't
[1:26:02] even have any of them what do you call
[1:26:03] it seems right
[1:26:07] does anybody know how to do that I've
[1:26:09] asked my wife to sower could you sow me
[1:26:12] a road without saying how in the world
[1:26:15] did they do it for him
[1:26:18] didn't say it describe
[1:26:20] that's what he does for us we got a robe
[1:26:23] but it's got no sayings right amen I
[1:26:25] don't know how he does it but the
[1:26:28] Garment I has has no scene he has no
[1:26:31] loose has anybody ever stood the deal of
[1:26:33] an eagle
[1:26:34] that a little baby eagle before mama
[1:26:36] sends him out on a solo he goes down he
[1:26:38] pulls out he tries to pull his feathers
[1:26:40] out if you got a loose feather a loose
[1:26:42] Revelation yeah
[1:26:43] oh yeah mama's gonna have to catch her
[1:26:46] you're gonna smack there so what an
[1:26:48] eagle does before they take their flight
[1:26:50] they'll take their big they pull them
[1:26:51] they make sure they don't have any loose
[1:26:53] feathers right and I do not believe this
[1:26:56] bride has any loose right that's right
[1:26:58] feathers I do not believe she's got any
[1:27:01] strings that are not Blended together
[1:27:03] right amen I believe all the loose ends
[1:27:06] are tied together now by this message
[1:27:08] and if we have the faith that we're
[1:27:11] supposed to have
[1:27:13] shouldn't we be able to tie it together
[1:27:14] right but what we've got is a bunch of
[1:27:17] preachers that don't tie it together
[1:27:18] right it's you too if you fall away
[1:27:21] you've got it tied together right you
[1:27:23] don't have a revelation it's not just
[1:27:24] the preacher
[1:27:26] preachers right that's why it's very now
[1:27:28] then I'm really starting to see the
[1:27:30] depth of what brother Brown said we need
[1:27:32] to pray for Revelations
[1:27:35] more than our next meal but you know
[1:27:37] what we're worried about
[1:27:39] making a check
[1:27:42] does anybody understand there's still
[1:27:43] people in a message say oh I'm going to
[1:27:45] move to where my job is there a message
[1:27:46] or no
[1:27:48] you mean to tell me if jobs more
[1:27:51] important than this message right God
[1:27:53] has already said he'll feed you he'll
[1:27:55] Feed Us amen I mean but they're looking
[1:27:58] at cars at homes that worldly did I read
[1:28:01] it worldly things right right that's
[1:28:04] what the guys are like you know what the
[1:28:05] devil's pulled this
[1:28:07] people in this age in this hour and some
[1:28:09] of them all worried about is cars and
[1:28:11] homes and clothes he said clothes that
[1:28:14] defeat the sparrow exactly why can't we
[1:28:17] have a revelation
[1:28:19] why do we get so bogged down with the
[1:28:22] world and the things of the world let's
[1:28:23] let's fly right right it's time that we
[1:28:26] fly and where we say I know right that's
[1:28:28] flying right amen if you're guessing
[1:28:31] you're not flying now that fourth
[1:28:33] creature was a flying eagle it didn't
[1:28:35] say an eagle right it said a flying
[1:28:37] right there's a big difference there
[1:28:39] everybody I'm not gonna perch on this an
[1:28:42] eagle perch on the earth is not much of
[1:28:43] an eagle right
[1:28:45] right right we're flying heels damn it
[1:28:48] Laurie I got I don't have any loose
[1:28:50] feathers I got a revelation I can see
[1:28:53] these things God has given me a
[1:28:54] revelation that cleans up all of Lucy
[1:28:56] that's right
[1:28:59] so we understand it thundered on a day
[1:29:02] of Pentecost everybody agree with that
[1:29:04] yeah
[1:29:05] thundered on Sunset mountain right
[1:29:09] and the church ages between me and you
[1:29:11] God quit dealing with them one seven
[1:29:12] seven or six to three yeah when brother
[1:29:15] random preached the indictment yep now
[1:29:17] he deals with us as individuals he's
[1:29:19] done to us just what he did to Israel
[1:29:21] right I think that's marvelous amen but
[1:29:24] you know what he'll not lose a one right
[1:29:26] you didn't lose one Israelite and it's
[1:29:29] not going to lose one of us
[1:29:32] I think he's marvelous don't you I think
[1:29:35] it's just
[1:29:37] I
[1:29:40] wish I could find an English word
[1:29:44] to express my gratitude exactly Glory
[1:29:48] guys I can't find it he's going to have
[1:29:51] to give me a new language right he right
[1:29:53] he's gonna have to give me a new tongue
[1:29:54] right to where I can express
[1:29:57] my love for you
[1:30:00] right exactly I just there's no verbal
[1:30:03] that I can to say how much I appreciate
[1:30:05] what he's done for me but it'd be good
[1:30:08] guys don't you appreciated all right so
[1:30:11] when you got a question in your if
[1:30:12] there's a Bible question there's a Bible
[1:30:14] answer absolutely I wouldn't I didn't
[1:30:16] jump on that brother say no you're wrong
[1:30:18] dig my heels and you say no and we both
[1:30:20] we both were real I I thought it was
[1:30:23] marvelous and I come well we both right
[1:30:25] you see what I'm saying we're both right
[1:30:27] right but the important part of it was
[1:30:30] you got to mix what you're saying with
[1:30:31] faith right right if you don't then
[1:30:34] there's where the argument comes from
[1:30:36] that's why we have the argument among
[1:30:39] some preachers
[1:30:40] right and Brethren said God doesn't
[1:30:42] already why would we argue we got a fake
[1:30:44] we got a revelation
[1:30:47] with him
[1:30:49] they got to get it the same way I got it
[1:30:52] right you know in Revelation I'm gonna
[1:30:54] quit I'm winding down Revelation 10 do
[1:30:56] you know you take the book from the
[1:30:58] angel that had his feet on the land and
[1:31:00] sea that wasn't random program couldn't
[1:31:03] give me the open book right brother
[1:31:06] Brown couldn't give me a revelation does
[1:31:07] everybody understand that only Christ
[1:31:10] can give you this literation
[1:31:12] brother Brandon couldn't give it to you
[1:31:14] he took Christ The Mighty angel coming
[1:31:16] down amen opening the seals
[1:31:19] to be able to do it right and it stood
[1:31:22] right there in a handle story right
[1:31:24] right it's sitting right there before us
[1:31:27] and now God's revealed it too right
[1:31:29] right amen I don't know about you guys
[1:31:31] but I'm excited about it the more I
[1:31:34] preach it the more excited I get right
[1:31:40] that's right
[1:31:43] and one thing I want to say about
[1:31:44] Revelation I'm gonna let you have it
[1:31:46] Revelation see this is what people think
[1:31:49] I read the quote where brother and said
[1:31:51] it's the Mysteries that how you're going
[1:31:53] to take the Rapture Mysteries plural
[1:31:55] this is what people do people preachers
[1:31:58] in a message they come up with Perugia
[1:32:00] you can't find perusia in the message
[1:32:02] you can't even find it in the Bible
[1:32:04] right did you know that right so what
[1:32:06] did they do they come up with a
[1:32:07] revelation because brother Brown said
[1:32:09] the Rapture is a revelation that's their
[1:32:10] what they say brother REM said it's the
[1:32:13] Mysteries yeah that's how you're going
[1:32:15] to take Mysteries plural yeah now
[1:32:17] Perugia is not one of the Mysteries does
[1:32:19] everybody understand that Dr prusa is
[1:32:21] it's God With Us the presence of God
[1:32:24] right hey that's sanctification
[1:32:28] all right you I believe in
[1:32:30] sanctification sure absolutely but you
[1:32:32] know what I believe it's on the inside
[1:32:34] yeah
[1:32:36] you know it's like people say on that
[1:32:38] deal God is my co-pilot he better be
[1:32:41] your pilot yeah that's right I've seen
[1:32:43] some of your driving and he better be
[1:32:46] your pilot forget the co-pilot stuff
[1:32:48] right that's what these people are
[1:32:49] saying they're saying perusual well this
[1:32:51] is Arrow so everybody's looking for a
[1:32:53] silver bullet to take a Rapture somebody
[1:32:55] understand that they don't have a
[1:32:58] revelation the Revelation is you've got
[1:33:00] to open the you've got to eat the open
[1:33:01] books all the Mysteries it's going to
[1:33:04] take every one of those Mysteries
[1:33:07] contained in the seals for you to take a
[1:33:10] Rapture amen so they bring what do they
[1:33:12] do they come out with the seven Thunders
[1:33:13] where it's seven one's in New York one's
[1:33:16] in Florida one's in Phoenix right man

[1:33:20] on seven men you better put it on seven
[1:33:22] Messengers right yeah that's right right
[1:33:24] yeah if you put it there I might I might
[1:33:26] go some way with you yeah but you put it
[1:33:29] on seven man that's brother I said
[1:33:30] Thunders were the Mysteries contained on
[1:33:32] the seals right but what they do is they
