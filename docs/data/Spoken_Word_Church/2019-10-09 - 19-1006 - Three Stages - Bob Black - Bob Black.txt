========================================

[Music] so this morning that's going to go through some scriptures and just kind of do a little bit of study so before we get started let's just go to the Lord in prayer I've got myself grateful to you to be able to gather together around the word within the history floor and learn more about you oh my god should this be with us today bless the services Melissa the wait is administered to the services today let's build a bagel or does he mr. Dedalus afternoon yes we're in a bunch English you can just take care of us all in the US and bless the city amen so I'm just kind of take a look at the three state you know Brown said in many meeting many times about three stages and all the different old tests on the types of three stages three pulls and three three this and three that and so we're gonna just kind of look at the three stages of the games of a Christian just by going through some some scripture this morning so I'm going to start at Romans chapter eight and we were trying to get this blown up enough so that it was visible on the screen I hope everybody can see that solo Romans chapter eight verse 1 we will be done about verse 23 or so and he's gonna comment along the way so check verse 1 says there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit there's no there's therefore now no condemnation they like it like Paul said in another scripture who can hold anything to the charge of God's elect okay look at chart ghazal it because once once you're in Christ that your soul is made absolutely perfect nothing nothing at all wrong nothing else is required for your soul because God is abiding in your soul he's living in the so therefore your justify the walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do and that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh to the law the law could not make us righteous and the law was really sent to kind of magnet to expose to us the sense that we need something and I kind of like to compare it if you've ever seen Ray Comfort he's he's kind of an apologist or like somebody that really knows how to defend the face and he's got some videos on behind them he'll actually go out to the streets and wait and present the gospel people standing outside courthouses and different things in the way he does it is he'll go through the Ten Commandments he goes through the law and presents the law to people and by presenting the law had exposes that they need something so she'll say have you ever told a lie have you ever committed adultery and and when you're presented with the law you and he'll saying you know about adultery well as Jesus said if you've even looked at somebody another perfect a woman with lust in your heart so he magnifies it in front of them and exposes their sensual you know and then they begin to realize that when because the law was presented to them that they need something but the law all the works of the law is not what could never make us righteous yeah it's we we we needed something and so that's that's where you know even when preaching you know you you uh you can't breathe just grace you got to preach the law the law as Wilson presented wouldn't follow it up great so that so that they know people know that there that that that the satisfaction of the law was made in the atonement that Christ died for us and that if we believe on that and and trust in the atonement then that will be young will give us his righteousness and that is the satisfaction of the law for whether the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh Ray Comfort and that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so the righteousness of the law was fulfilled by God manifesting himself in us and a lot of times even we kind of lose sight of the fact that we're not here just to kind of do do the works but we're we're here I was in life it's Jax but I feel the law so when God is making manifest in your life is word it's you actually walking out the law and being the actual fulfillment of the law for your day of the word for your day because you that's that's really the only way for the law to be expressed as by the spirit so let's just lay there after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the Spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God in other words they that are motivated by the things of the flesh they that are in the flesh means those that are that are motivated and following that law of the flesh and following the will of the flesh instead of following the mind of God in but he are not in the flesh that's kind of made me a strange way right because we're we're physically where we're in this tabernacle of the flesh but you're not in the flesh doesn't mean that you're not in this tabernacle of the flesh but you're not motivated by the things of the flesh because you're you've got a the mind of Christ in you to move you to lead you in the guide you if so be that the Spirit of God willing now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of his and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the Spirit is life because of righteousness so then Paul he's starting to get into something you got kind of a strength like a conflicting an environment with it you've got the body is is dead but there's something inside of you that can make that body obey the obey the will of God that something that's the soul of God can make the body can bring the body into subjection and bring it into obedience just like Billy Graham talked about that a solar system where you become like the soul is like the Sun and the planets rotating it about it might might be your five senses and that soul on the inside brings the outside into into harmony and moving everything and in the correct cadence moving it in the rhythm of the word so it brings the body into subjection to the life of God on the inside there's a spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he didn't raise the Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you in other words it's gonna weaken it to life it will make that body or bring that body into subjection now that's the whole story of the message is that is that when you're born again you see you have trouble in the flesh and you'll have trouble and you'll always be prickly brother Graham said until until your last step but that story is the whole story is that it is the rising of the Sun and when that life comes into that body into the word then it will bring you it won't slowly bring your senses here your men will reason consciousness every aspect of you into subjection to the word and that's the power of the word there is power in the gospel it's not we're not we're not just listening for the word vain words of some man but we're actually listening to the Word of God when you read the Bible it's the Word of God actually coming to pass in your in your members and bringing your whole beating into subjection to the order therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for you to live after the flesh he shall die but if you do the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live in other words there's something that you got to do you got to eat the word constantly be sincere living humility destroy the works of the flesh but Bob just like your attitude say I don't want to live like this and you open yourself up to the Word of God and that's killing the DS [Music] for but if you through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body each shall live for as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God now that's the powerful scripture because that means that the Spirit of God is actually something that can motivate you that this this more than just being educated into into the mitches there's actually a person that we're talking about there's actually a person that can lead you in your walk they can instruct you in everything from where to get a job or where to go to school what to do with yourself the purpose in life they can motivate you to make great decisions in life but small decisions big decisions my program said the reason that he speak he raised that little fishie from the dead instead of a big event was to prove to us that God cares about the little things he cares about everything from the small to the great and and he's leading us he's leading us by a spirit and so uh when you when you begin to that's what he wants us to have a fellowship with him not just not just to kind of just kind of learn it like you're going to school where but this is like I was talking about Wednesday night this is a love relationship with God we're actually we're actually learning more about him because we're in a relationship with him not just not just to study call it's not just a cold ed formal religion there's a spirit of a living God that we're following for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry the father so here we're getting into the three stages of the gross growth process when you're born again and I've talked about this before when you're born again you begin to like a baby when it's born it's supposed to be the first thing that comes with when it's born first thing that it sees is this day is it comes out and it says how about father and that's the same way when you're born again you begin to see God you begin to see that's that's what other M said the evidence of the new birth is a personal revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally and and when you come when you're born again and you come forth and you see the father you begin to it begins to appear you and how he what he is and that's something personal to you that's why you know it's wonderful that you know to share a testimony and things and you hear a preacher preach about things but that's all things that are it can be third-person something that they've been through it's got to be something that you personally have known already and then it becomes then you know what it means to cry out a lot because you're seeing the father for yourself the spirit itself took Celeste that's ground floor that's the first stage and and if we have time to look through some some different things that brother Ram said and just kind of go through the different scriptures in the Bible they talked about these three stages to kind of really expose that brother branham didn't make this stuff up it's actually in the scripture all of these things come from when he's talking about three pools and three stages we we would have no idea about these things that without a prophet coming but he didn't just make this up it's all throughout the Bible from the beginning to the end the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God so you say well I don't know if I have well get into the word and and seek his spirit and he will bear with us to you that whether or not that you have it and if children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together because he's bringing us to a place of glorification right where I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us that's maybe something that we decide of awfulness is the end of the road and you know what we preach about that so many times that God in the death before the foundation of the world he had a picture of you in his mind and it was not as a little baby and it was not as an old person but it was in the prime of your youth it's a full-grown person walking in the statute of a perfect maintenance that's the picture that God had a meal and so that's that's the investor end of the road so you know when you go through heartaches and troubles and things just kind of keep that in mind that God is molding you into his image and it might be rough and it might be tiresome and struggles and everything but there's a purpose and a plan in God in God's mind for her here is that first verse 19 this is God's purpose for you for the artist men expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God the creature the creature ears look out all creation and all creationism is is looking for somebody to be on this earth with these virtues may manifest in you so there's the second stage the second stage of your growth is to have all these virtues in there and then he's sealed in by that holy and brotherly kind the Holy Ghost sealing all these virtues in you into that into that person somebody that we're at what the spirit of their spirit of the memory reason Constance affection all those things give way entirely to that to that soul pushing out so that all these things can be made manifest that you got it they got a manifested son of God walking and talking just like the father for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope that the creature didn't make or was not made subject to vanity because of because of our decision because if we wanted to but God allowed these things to happen so that his word could be made manifest because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God from we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now why because it's it's the Word of God is being produced just like a woman in labor push at birth pains like programmed push down the whole creation groans and travails the calls because the son of man is being birthed by the word and and in every age the word was being pitted their word was being produced but now the culmination of all things now as the time for this this entire picture to be produced and and we're looking at I'm looking at it right now and that's that's a that's amazing when you think about it and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit of our body so what's adoption adoption is when you come to a place where God can reveal something it was not revealed to eating in other church ings the secret or the revelation is like us it's not like a secret like we're looking for that lost tape the program preached or or that little secret phrase but see the simplicity of the gospel is that it starts with justification sanctification - baptism the Holy Ghost and that mystery keeps unfolding until it comes to its fullness and if the whole thing is really that simple justification sanctification of the baptism only goes away and this is implicitly gospel just keeps magnifying it's it's like a little baby growing the little baby when it's born has it's got ten toes and ten fingers it's got everything that an adult will have it starts out with hair and start several toenails all those different things but when it grows up it's all that is magnified it's come into a full grown condition so waiting for the adoption to wit or to understand the redemption of our body in other words to understand that I am NOT going to die to understand that they're up to have a supernatural revelation that my body will be changed and there is nothing that can stop that that's what the that's what adoption is to wit that the revelation of the body and and that's why these Church ages didn't did not come to that revelation it took God coming with a capstone message to open the books to reveal to us that that hidden mystery that God has revealed them since it restores back to their understanding that there's a growth process them and all these things they go into the message so let's look at this for a second let's look at these three stages in the scripture so first Peter first Peter chapter 2 he said wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile hypocrisy and envies and all evil speakings as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby if some be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious now see that's where when you read the Bible there's a bucket of hidden things revealed in between the letters and so because it may be maybe when you were a newborn baby you read this and then you're just talking about any any of you you read to that's what he's just talking about we need to study but he's talking about these three stages as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word then you make room their life if so be he of takes it that the Lord is gracious to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious the ye also as lively stones because in this whole body of Christ you are a stone eating them mix up like little little pyramids with in this great big pyramid you are little few minutes that go into this building and you're you're not like a rock that can't move or something but you're a lively stomach our built up a spiritual house an holy priesthood you you all of these lively stones built up together a spiritual house for God to dwell in because down through the seven churches culminating in the Saints that makes that makes the complete Bride of Christ and God is dwelling in his bride and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion our chief Cornerstone in other words that the capstone is shaped just like a cornerstone mr. parsall Jesus Christ is our cornerstone that's the thing the revelation of Jesus is that the thing that our new birth is founded on is the foundation of the entire Christian journey and he will also be the head he's the head and the corner and and this whole picture the whole pyramid is Jesus Christ revealed it's revealed all together in this bride an individual I lay in Zion a chief Cornerstone that led to precious and indeed that believeth on him shall not be confounded in other words he didn't believe it on him will not be confused you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and when it's revealed to you and you'll you'll have an understanding that will not make you be tossed about and running around wondering what's what's what what's what's down what's up unto you therefore which believe he is precious gainers be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made then a doctor came and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient where are two Hafsah they were corner a stone of stumbling because it seems so simply people it seems kept so confusing and and it just makes people stumble over the revelation of the Lord so let's go where it says he says it's our off on verse 12 for when for the time ye ought to be teaching you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong for for he's telling young Eva grow up a little bit you don't need to get up where you can start understanding the things in the in the promised land keep that old corn of the land if they eat the mysteries for every one that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a vain but strongly belong it for them that are a fool age even though I really use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil so he's saying again there isn't a scripture that you start off with a bang wrote a full Ange mystery to know Galatians now I say that the air as long as he is a child because now now this is the second stage you start off as a baby and then you're a child and finally you're a man or a woman in the in the script now I say that the air as long as he as a child so he's coming up on the beach now with a baby anymore-- differeth nothing from a servant though he be the Lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the Father and so he's talking about you need the tutor of the Holy Ghost to nurse us and raise it was up until the tutor could say well he's looked people just like the father he's a child a child these child really those children you know disobedient you do stuff you like like I was preaching Wednesday night about you know David did a lot anyway I made a lot of mistakes we make a lot of mistakes as Christians and then the Lord will give us a little whipping I can come to church or sometimes the preachers give your little quickly yeah and you and you straighten up and and you and you and God keeps molding you into his image right so we start off with babies and then the world through the children keep growing up until we come up there's me visas for pull my disability yeah Ephesians 4 is talking about talking about how we're growing into the into the Grace and knowledge of Jesus Christ I might've found the wrong Scripture oh yeah this Ephesians 4:14 now for so he talks about how he gave fossil products fabulous powerful ministry for perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of life Christ - we all come in the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect name stature perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ so if you ever wondered where does the scripture say statue of perfect man and it doesn't say the word statue of a perfect man but that's description patience 4:13 the stature of the fullness of Christ unto a perfect man then we get support B would no more children though that's the second stage children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and linked to the seat especially the truth in love may grow up in them and all things which is the head even Christ and then we go to first correct I really like this tree we just get a few more minutes first Corinthians 13 is where he's talking about love let's start have charity never faileth but we know in part and we prophesy in part he said we we know we know what we're looking to play you through a glass darkly we see things heart Parcher but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away and then it goes in to see he's talking about growth when I was a child I spake as a child when I read I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass darkly another word partial revelation you see the grace that God has shown us in this age that we we have the privilege to not be able to look partially to a glass darkly like looking at Jesus through a damp like maybe fogged over glass and you can see his image and kind of get a sense of his form and everything but now we can see him face to face through his word we can we can see him exactly the way all these mysteries and everything are are completely unfolded before us but the in face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known and now abideth Faith Hope charity these three but the greatest of these is cheering why because charity let's go back to verse eight charity never faileth whether it be promising they shall fail whether they be shown and all these thing he talks about how the cherry bears all things believeth all things hopeth things and your shopping and so forth then all these virtues are made manifest evening you're completely a subjection to the Word of God which is warning your door and then we'll go back to [Music] seasons four eleven which is what we looked at earlier till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man may be dispatched to the former she cries so they you've got three stages and it's important to look at to understand those three stages because when you read scripture then things like the story Ruth the story of Elijah going from the Gilgal school of prophets River Jordan Ruth deciding gleaning resting Abraham deciding god sanctifying a method with the burning lamp and smoking furnace and then meeting to some man all these three stages are
