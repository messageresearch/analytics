[3:23] So, you just look into his word. That's
[3:25] right. You'll find it. Amen. Good to see
[3:27] everybody in the house of the Lord. If
[3:28] you like turning your scriptures, turn
[3:30] where we've been reading from our
[3:32] favorite scripture, Ephesians
[3:35] 1. Had read that probably one whole
[3:39] service. Ephesians 1. Good to see
[3:41] everybody in the house of the Lord.
[3:42] Remember to pray for all of the children
[3:45] today and for Wade and Jun and him for
[3:47] you know coming back home Anna from the
[3:50] youth camp there brother Burley. So keep
[3:51] those in mind uh that the Lord would be
[3:54] with him and to remember now uh they
[3:57] have the new book number six of the
[4:00] Jorgensson book. Now you can also get
[4:04] these in MP3s on some of it.
[4:07] Okay everybody understand you can get it
[4:10] that way or you can get the books to
[4:11] read. So, but we've got to know what to
[4:14] order. So, then you'll have to write me
[4:17] a note, gift it to Lisa. We'll have to
[4:19] get it together. If you want them, you
[4:21] know, from to get these on the new ones.
[4:24] I already finished mine. I know me and
[4:26] my wife has cuz brother uh Anderson them
[4:29] gave it to us the other day and it's
[4:31] really good. I enjoyed it and I really,
[4:34] you know, appreciate it what they're
[4:36] trying to do and what they said. So, but
[4:38] if you want it, make sure we leave this
[4:40] laying here where that we'll make sure
[4:42] to announce it again. But we got to get
[4:43] it together, you know, and to send it in
[4:46] at one time and then we can get it back
[4:47] as a lump sum. If not, then you'll have
[4:50] to get your address part and get it
[4:52] yourself. So, just remember that.
[4:55] Remember, the Bible study will be the
[4:56] this coming Saturday, the Lord willing.
[4:59] The topics are what we're on. This one
[5:01] will just be strictly questions.
[5:04] Whatever you have, it won't be an
[5:06] assigned part. It'll be strictly uh
[5:09] questions, something that you have in on
[5:11] your heart and we'll take them as far as
[5:13] we can how many times we have to and
[5:16] we'll we'll do it that way. So, just
[5:18] remember that. And also remember that
[5:20] brother Quinn will be here with us uh
[5:23] preaching for the weekend and all this
[5:26] upcoming weekend. Remember that and be
[5:28] much in prayer for him and all. All
[5:30] right. Uh my wife wants me to make sure
[5:33] to thank all of you for your prayers and
[5:36] and everything and your visits, your
[5:38] cards, your calls, your your things that
[5:40] you brought, flowers and things. But she
[5:43] really appreciates it. We just
[5:44] appreciate it from the bottom of her
[5:46] heart of all of you and especially the
[5:48] prayers cuz that's the main thing. And
[5:50] they've cleared her up, okay, on the
[5:52] heart. They've cleared her up on the
[5:54] upper part of her stomach and you know,
[5:56] no bleeding ulcers in that part. So now
[5:59] they have a few more tests to run, but
[6:02] all they're running is turning out to be
[6:04] okay. Uh they have figured out part of
[6:07] it is the deterioration in her back of
[6:10] the degenerative uh plain old thing of
[6:13] saying arthritis in your back and all.
[6:16] So you know just keep her in your
[6:18] prayers, keep praying for her that the
[6:19] Lord would would uh you know bring her
[6:21] through all of this and everything will
[6:23] be okay. All right. Any other
[6:25] announcements? I generally forget. I try
[6:26] to write them down where I can remember
[6:28] it. But uh if not, then we'll try to do
[6:31] it. But turn if you will to Ephesians
[6:35] 1. Father, we thank you for this day. We
[6:38] thank you for the day and the hour that
[6:39] we're living upon the earth. We thank
[6:41] you for you, Lord, because we know one
[6:44] thing for sure. Without you, there is no
[6:46] hopes in any of us whatsoever. That's
[6:49] right. Our dependency is upon you. And
[6:51] we ask you to just guide us and direct
[6:54] us in understanding, Lord. open our
[6:56] understanding to thy word because that's
[6:58] what we've been talking about and as we
[7:01] go along the way that you would speak to
[7:04] us as you did with the disciples that
[7:06] day and open our understanding and Lord
[7:09] but that still did not give them the new
[7:11] birth. It did not give them eternal life
[7:13] because you opened their understanding
[7:15] but the day of Pentecost came you
[7:17] revealed the word that you had opened
[7:20] unto them and that brought eternal life.
[7:22] We love you and we thank you. have your
[7:25] way now and guide us in Jesus name.
[7:28] Amen.
[7:32] Ephesians
[7:34] one. I told you I'd get back to preach
[7:36] on this scripture eventually. You know,
[7:38] when we started using it on the
[7:40] predestinations and things, I told you
[7:42] I'd get back to this and I wanted to
[7:44] preach on it. So, you know, we'll start
[7:46] verse three. Blessed be the God and
[7:48] Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
[7:50] have blessed us with all spiritual
[7:52] blessings in heavenly places in Christ,
[7:55] according as he hath chosen us in him
[7:57] before the foundation of the world, that
[8:00] we should be holy without blame before
[8:02] him in love, having predestinated us
[8:05] unto the adoption of children by Jesus
[8:08] Christ to himself, according to the good
[8:10] pleasure of his will, to the praise of
[8:12] the glory of his grace, wherein he hath
[8:15] made us accepted
[8:17] and the beloved. You may be seated. The
[8:19] Lord had his blessing to the reading of
[8:22] the word. If if some of you brothers
[8:25] would pass
[8:29] these now, if I had all the notes
[8:34] that I've looked over on this, you would
[8:37] be getting about 40 pages this morning.
[8:40] But uh now what I want to do if I can I
[8:43] say it if I
[8:44] can I want to go through uh this morning
[8:48] and kind of just give you a a little
[8:52] layout of what we're talking about. And
[8:55] you know it may be a series of services
[8:58] in this. I don't know because I don't go
[9:01] I just go dayto day to see what the Lord
[9:03] speaks to me to bring out. And along in
[9:06] the about the middle of the service
[9:08] series that I was in about on
[9:10] predestination and things like that, the
[9:13] Lord opened up something to me that had
[9:16] always been kind of
[9:18] a sticker, I guess you call it, uh thing
[9:22] that I could not completely
[9:25] understand. All right? And then when he
[9:28] did, it opened unto me to where that I
[9:31] could speak on it. And I want to try to
[9:34] do that to you. But I want to just try
[9:36] to, you know, not read a lot this
[9:38] morning, but maybe depend on the fact
[9:41] that you know the message and then we
[9:44] will come back this afternoon if
[9:46] necessary and we will use a lot of the
[9:49] quotes that brother Brown has said on
[9:52] this topic and then you know maybe the
[9:55] the internet people can get a better
[9:57] understanding. So, I'm just asking you
[10:00] out there if you will. If you don't
[10:02] understand what I'm talking about,
[10:04] please just listen to another service or
[10:07] so. And you know, I would do that with
[10:09] you. And that's all I've asked instead
[10:11] of just cutting off and saying, "Well,
[10:12] he's wrong. He's in another group.
[10:14] That's this group over here. That's so
[10:16] and so believes that." Well, it might be
[10:18] all right. I don't know what so and so
[10:20] believes. I just go by what I believe
[10:22] and I just tell you what I believe cuz
[10:24] what somebody else believes is their
[10:26] business. But I kind of want to do it
[10:28] that way and just kind of speak on it
[10:30] and then, you know, back up and if
[10:33] necessary,
[10:35] um, you know, do a, uh, a lot of the
[10:38] quotes and things. But if you would
[10:41] while we're going along in the message
[10:45] today, if you see what you think is a
[10:48] question in your mind, you know, we'll
[10:51] write it down and you know, and uh even
[10:54] give it to them in between services
[10:56] today and you know, whatever or keep it
[10:59] and we will then have maybe the Lord
[11:02] willing uh Wednesday or something, we
[11:04] might even have total questions and
[11:06] answers relating to this subject. But
[11:09] what we're going to talk about is chosen
[11:13] in Him. That will be the title and you
[11:17] know for uh a couple of messages I'm
[11:20] sure. But
[11:22] now we've been reading this from
[11:25] Ephesians for quite some time. And as I
[11:29] said, I told you that I would try to
[11:30] come back and I wanted to speak on
[11:34] Ephesians 1 and and try to get a little
[11:37] understanding about it. All right. Now
[11:40] we've been talking about and using
[11:43] Ephesians 1 how we did you know the
[11:45] adoption and the predestination and the
[11:48] things and uh then we've come we came
[11:51] over and we studied in Romans
[11:54] 8 now about the uh you know three stages
[11:59] of adoption in other words your new
[12:01] birth the receiving Jesus Christ as a
[12:05] new birth and that's dealing with that
[12:07] verse chapter 8 now verse like 14-1 17
[12:12] were that we become hes and joint hes
[12:16] and that new birth that you received
[12:18] that we must receive the new birth to
[12:20] make us the children of God and then we
[12:23] will understand something this this
[12:25] morning that's going to go in that that
[12:27] will bring into view I hope an
[12:31] understanding of why brother Brandham
[12:33] would would come forth and state and say
[12:36] that you always was eternal Right. All
[12:40] right. I'm hoping that will give this
[12:42] will give us a better understanding of
[12:44] that. But I believe that you must
[12:46] receive the new birth. Right. You must
[12:49] receive eternal life. Amen. And that is
[12:52] stage one of the adoption which is the
[12:55] identification of a child of God. And we
[12:58] preached upon that for quite a while.
[13:00] you know that uh even in comparison that
[13:03] on the river Jordan there the Lord Jesus
[13:06] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[13:08] not because he had to as a new birth but
[13:12] to be able to bring forth the fullness
[13:14] of the godhead bodily into the point of
[13:18] where that he would uh the anointing for
[13:21] his ministry etc. All right, we covered
[13:24] the anointing. We've covered the things
[13:26] of trying to to get it. This is for
[13:28] somebody that clicks in on internet and
[13:30] doesn't hear, you know, and they say,
[13:31] "What in the world are they talking
[13:33] about? Back up and listen. If you don't
[13:34] want to back up and listen, forget it."
[13:37] All right. But see, then we went over to
[13:40] covering stage one. And then we went to
[13:42] stage two about verse 18- 21 of Romans 8
[13:46] to where that we were talking about the
[13:50] authority that the children of God is is
[13:53] expected to come to are the hear ye him
[13:57] that Jesus came to on the mount of
[14:00] transfiguration and that would come out
[14:02] to be here ye him you know and your name
[14:06] on the checkbook etc etc. All right. And
[14:09] then in that we were talking about the
[14:12] I'm in a hurry. So I'm trying to lay a
[14:14] background to say something in a minute.
[14:16] But so you should know it here
[14:20] especially that we covered through that
[14:22] stage that it's a manifestation of the
[14:25] sons of God that the world is waiting
[14:27] on. And the word manifest is to make
[14:30] known.
[14:31] See to make known. you you you go down
[14:34] to a store and and you order something
[14:38] and they'll give you a manifest or a
[14:40] piece of paper that declares on that
[14:43] piece of paper what is you're supposed
[14:45] to be getting. And that's more or less
[14:47] called a manifest, you know. All right.
[14:50] But in a scriptural sense, it's to make
[14:52] known, right? All right. See, then we
[14:55] covered for weeks and weeks about how
[14:57] that we must make him known. Yes, sir.
[15:00] And then he'll make us known.
[15:03] See, we make him known by the preaching
[15:05] of the gospel and then he he'll make us
[15:08] known by signs and wonders, you know. So
[15:10] then everybody gets into that. Oh, we
[15:12] just don't see nothing. Well, I wonder
[15:15] where you would be if you was back
[15:17] before. So that's all right. Just go on.
[15:19] But I'm just trying to get it to a place
[15:22] to where we can understand. See, I all
[15:25] I've tried to do is to and I realize
[15:27] that no man can reveal God.
[15:30] Jesus Christ was the only one that could
[15:32] come and reveal or make him manifest
[15:37] known to word that you could see God.
[15:40] All right? See, then we can't do it as
[15:42] human beings. But the new birth,
[15:45] the new birth that comes within us, see,
[15:48] and the anointing, the teaching, the
[15:50] inside, and then the the teaching
[15:52] outwardly to work that we can make him
[15:55] known. And remember what we were talking
[15:57] about in there in in Luke where that the
[16:00] disciples on the road to Emmas that
[16:03] Jesus opened their understanding of the
[16:06] scriptures and then drops on down that
[16:08] was the two drops on down a little bit
[16:11] in the scriptures and meets with the
[16:13] other disciples and he opens their
[16:16] understanding of the scriptures. All
[16:18] right. But see that didn't give them the
[16:20] new birth as I was praying right? They
[16:22] had to wait till Pentecost. Pentecost
[16:25] quickened what Jesus opened. Right?
[16:28] Amen. Now, so we ought to realize that
[16:30] no man can teach us anything. So what we
[16:33] do is we depend upon the fivefold
[16:35] ministry to bring us the message to
[16:38] break it down to word that we can
[16:42] understand God, you know, through the
[16:45] the gifts that they have and the
[16:48] speaking. And I'll get to it. You notice
[16:50] in the message after a while you'll
[16:52] click on to something that you'll see
[16:54] that those gifts are predestinated
[16:58] eternally eternally.
[17:01] Right. I said the gifts. I didn't say
[17:04] the person. That's right. I didn't say
[17:06] the person. So now you click off to see
[17:09] you go by what I say and you'll be all
[17:11] right. I won't have no trouble with you.
[17:14] But see then the gifts and callings of
[17:16] God are what? Without repentance.
[17:19] Oh, I thought you repented and finally
[17:20] done nothing. No, no, it's
[17:22] without. I think I have it in here. If
[17:25] not, I've got it in the office there
[17:26] where brother and said, "If I quit
[17:28] today, don't never preach another
[17:30] sermon. Go sit down beside the river."
[17:32] Right. That's what he said. That's
[17:33] right. He said, "I'm still saved." Amen.
[17:37] But he said, "I do it because I love God
[17:39] and want to do it." Right? All right.
[17:42] Cuz that's gifts. All right. But now
[17:44] watch that after a while when we tie
[17:46] together the message. Would you
[17:48] understand what we're saying then? All
[17:50] the ministries to do in the last days,
[17:52] the five-fold ministry is to open our
[17:55] understanding.
[17:56] And that doesn't do away with the women
[17:58] teaching the women and the the children
[18:01] and the things. I listen to the
[18:02] children. I listen to you talking, you
[18:05] know, because I believe God can use you
[18:07] to speak to me. All right? And see, just
[18:11] because you're a ministry said, "Well, I
[18:12] ain't listen to nobody." Well, then
[18:13] you're not a five-fold ministry in in
[18:15] God. You're not called of God. Forget
[18:17] it. I mean, you already have enough
[18:19] sense to realize that. But you don't.
[18:22] So, and that won't change nothing.
[18:23] That's all right. See, I'm not trying to
[18:25] win the world. I'm trying to win those
[18:27] that will hear the word and for them to
[18:30] listen and realize this is what it is,
[18:32] you know, and get an understanding. All
[18:35] right, that's stage two. See, that's in
[18:37] the basis of of the stage two, which is
[18:40] the
[18:41] authority. And in that stage we found
[18:44] out that there is where the headstone
[18:47] comes to adopt the individual into the
[18:50] body of Christ is in stage two our
[18:52] manifestation the sons and daughters of
[18:54] God. The headstone would come and unite
[18:57] then with the individual and that is
[18:59] your adoption. I believe that was
[19:02] brother Ram's adoption when the head
[19:04] united with the body and there he was in
[19:06] Arizona and and it united he came back
[19:09] and proved it by showing what God had
[19:12] revealed to him. You say I believe it's
[19:15] over here. Well, don't worry about it.
[19:16] We all believe he was adopted. All
[19:18] right. So you if you have somewhere to
[19:20] put it and you got his words come and
[19:22] show me. All right. But now
[19:26] listen. Then we come to the place of the
[19:30] third stage of adoption which is verse
[19:32] 23 of Romans 8 says to whit to
[19:37] understand the redemption of the body.
[19:40] Right? All right. Now see then in this
[19:44] life we need to be more concerned with
[19:48] the understanding of the
[19:51] redemption you know the plan of
[19:52] redemption than we do in the point of
[19:55] being changed because that will be in a
[19:57] moment a twinkle of an eye that'll take
[20:00] place but if we don't get the message
[20:04] planted into our hearts correctly. Amen.
[20:06] How can God quicken it? You say, "Well,
[20:08] brother Dale, I've read the message for
[20:10] 40 years." Amen.
[20:12] But what has God revealed to you? Right?
[20:15] That's all I'mma ask. As I always told
[20:17] you, I wish I had revealed in my heart
[20:19] what I've got in my head. My head is
[20:22] like a computer. You know, it can
[20:25] remember and do and all like this, but
[20:27] my heart is where God reveals it at. You
[20:30] don't receive the new birth in your
[20:31] brain. Although, we do need a baptizing
[20:35] of the Holy Ghost in the brain. And I
[20:36] wish God would do that because it would
[20:38] cleanse out a lot of problems we have.
[20:41] But that doesn't work. All right. So
[20:44] then to go on with the rest of it. See?
[20:47] All right. And see then to with to
[20:50] understand the redemption of the
[20:53] body. See, in other words, something has
[20:57] got to come forth in the last days.
[20:59] Amen. And give us an understanding. You
[21:01] say, "Well, we have the message." Well,
[21:03] that's right.
[21:05] I agree with you. We have the message.
[21:07] You understand? But has it been
[21:09] revealed? That's right. Now, you
[21:11] remember how we kept going over it and
[21:13] over
[21:13] it that if the message is not preached
[21:17] pure and unadulterated from man's ideas,
[21:21] how can God quicken it? That's right. He
[21:25] would be quickening hybrid word or
[21:27] hybrid doings. That would be
[21:28] denominationalism.
[21:31] And that won't work. Well, brother Dale,
[21:33] you understand everything. I didn't say
[21:35] that.
[21:37] What has been revealed to me, I
[21:39] understand. Yes. That's right. What has
[21:41] been revealed, made known, made alive in
[21:44] me, I understand. And I don't worry
[21:45] about anybody trying to take it away
[21:47] from me because that it's a revelation.
[21:50] And if it's not a revelation, you can
[21:52] get it away from me easily by out
[21:54] arguing me. Right? But I'm not going to
[21:56] argue with you anyway. I'm just going to
[21:57] go on down the road. But if you come to
[22:00] talk to me about it, make sure you got
[22:02] the message to talk about, right? Not
[22:04] what you think.
[22:06] What we think ain't worth two cents. But
[22:09] do you understand now the
[22:11] background that in verse 23 it says that
[22:14] we would come to a place that where
[22:16] there would be an
[22:18] understanding of the redemption of the
[22:21] body would come into view because
[22:24] automatically then brother Brandon when
[22:26] he covered it he covered the seals he
[22:28] said this is the complete plan of
[22:31] redemption. All right. Was for what?
[22:34] Body, spirit, soul, world, right? Amen.
[22:38] Everything was the complete plan of
[22:40] redemption brought in the message of the
[22:43] hour. Now watch this and you in a minute
[22:45] when I say something when your computer
[22:48] clicks, just uncclick it. Your brain, in
[22:50] other words, just uncclick it and
[22:52] remember what I'm saying. We don't do
[22:54] not believe in another messenger to come
[22:58] to straighten out brother Random's
[22:59] message. We don't need that. is perfect.
[23:03] All right. Now, he made his mistakes in
[23:06] like the white horse rider and the
[23:07] things. There's mistakes in speech,
[23:10] dates, times, seasons maybe. But the
[23:13] message of the hour is perfect. All
[23:16] right. I believe that now. But we can
[23:19] get our own thoughts in there and when
[23:21] we do, then we pervert the message. And
[23:24] how can God quicken it? Yeah. How could
[23:27] it have been quickened on the day of
[23:29] Pentecost to those disciples that Jesus
[23:32] had
[23:33] raised? See, if he hadn't raised,
[23:38] see,
[23:40] you understand? See, it it's the word's
[23:43] got to be preached pure and
[23:44] unadulterated. That's the only thing
[23:46] I've ever contended for
[23:49] is to earnestly contend for the faith
[23:51] that was once delivered. See the
[23:53] revelation that was delivered to the
[23:55] saints and delivered to the see we built
[23:57] on the foundation apostles and prophets
[24:00] which would be the whole Bible. Amen.
[24:03] And brother Ram never come to give us
[24:05] another Bible. He come to tell us this
[24:07] Bible was right. And to give us the
[24:09] right understanding of it. He opened our
[24:12] understanding
[24:14] to the scriptures.
[24:17] He couldn't reveal it. He could just
[24:19] open our understanding. Jesus opened
[24:21] their understanding. He couldn't reveal
[24:23] it. He opened their understanding. They
[24:26] went to Pentecost with that
[24:28] understanding. What was quickened? That
[24:30] understanding. That's right. That's why
[24:33] they was
[24:34] only 120. Even though the Bible said he
[24:37] was seen of 500, he calls them brethren,
[24:39] which probably means they later became
[24:42] Christian or or why else would it call
[24:44] them brethren.
[24:46] See, but yet they didn't go to the upper
[24:48] room. Why?
[24:50] They had a doubt. They had a thought.
[24:52] They had something wrong. Amen. But the
[24:56] 120 in the upper room might have had
[24:57] problems sitting there and thought they
[24:59] ought to get up and go do things, but
[25:01] they was with one accord on one thing.
[25:04] He said the Holy Ghost would come.
[25:06] That's right. And we're going to stay
[25:07] and wait. All right. Now, trying to get
[25:09] on with it. See, then we covered in one
[25:12] of the last messages on speaking
[25:17] that the head and body would unite in
[25:20] the last
[25:21] days to bring the
[25:24] message. All right. Now, as I just got
[25:28] through saying, we're not looking for
[25:29] another prophet. We're not looking for
[25:31] another message. Amen.
[25:34] We're looking for this message that
[25:36] we've received to be revealed, which
[25:38] will be the revelation that's contained
[25:40] in the Bible. Right? People will hold up
[25:42] a Bible and they'll say, "This is the
[25:44] Bible." They'll hold up quotes from the
[25:45] prophet. They'll say, "This is the
[25:47] revelation." Amen. Well, now, how can
[25:49] that be when both of them are letters on
[25:50] a page, right?
[25:53] All right. See, why not just hold this
[25:55] one up, the Bible? Yes.
[25:58] And say, "This is the revelation." Cuz
[26:00] it is. It is. But it was sealed away
[26:03] from us. Right. Right. Yes.
[26:07] Not only was it sealed away by seven
[26:09] seals, that would be the end time
[26:12] mysteries, it was sealed away to you and
[26:14] I until we receive the new birth. Right?
[26:19] Because the Bible says no man can call
[26:21] Jesus the Christ except what?
[26:24] By the new birth. All right? Cuz you got
[26:28] to have the inside teacher. Okay? So,
[26:31] now we're getting to the point that I
[26:32] want to just lay something down now and
[26:34] watch
[26:35] it. And and I tried this on my wife
[26:38] yesterday. She had no uh you know, she
[26:42] was having problems with her has with
[26:45] sleeping and things and some of the
[26:47] medication makes her sleepy. And I was
[26:50] thinking about while I was doing it,
[26:52] Brother Ram, you remember he said one
[26:53] day that that he got so tickled to death
[26:55] about something he saw. I believe it was
[26:57] about grace. Now I think it's right. But
[26:59] anyhow, he said that he woke me up and
[27:01] he said he preached to her for about an
[27:03] hour and a half and he said she was
[27:05] graceful enough sit there and listen.
[27:07] Well, my wife came in to study yesterday
[27:09] and I don't have any notes written on
[27:12] some of this message whatsoever. I
[27:14] refuse to write it
[27:15] down. But she came in and and I thought,
[27:19] well, I'll I'll try her out on it and
[27:21] see how it works. Well, she had problems
[27:24] staying awake and she, you know, that
[27:26] was all right. But that's what I
[27:27] thought. I thought, well, this is maybe
[27:29] this is working the same way. But I
[27:31] tried it out on her for about an hour
[27:33] and a half or an hour or something on
[27:35] the message to see what she thought
[27:37] about it and she made the correct
[27:39] answer. So, you know, we we go from
[27:42] that. Uh but and she started off and
[27:45] I'll get to that in a minute. She
[27:47] started off with it when I asked her a
[27:49] question, she answered it exactly to
[27:51] where that I have been stood I have
[27:53] stood for 40ome years and I'm going to
[27:57] go ahead and say it that I believe
[27:58] that's basically where most of you are
[28:01] standing on this point that I want to
[28:03] get to in a minute. All right. Now, and
[28:06] and there's nothing wrong with it cuz
[28:08] it's right.
[28:09] But things are it's time for us to as
[28:13] Aaron was bringing out there Wednesday.
[28:14] I thoroughly enjoyed his message. And he
[28:17] was bringing out that, you know, that
[28:19] the Corinthians couldn't stand the word
[28:21] too good, but the Ephesians could stand
[28:24] strong meat. Well, I think it's about
[28:26] time the Lulians could still word can,
[28:29] you know, stand some strong meat and and
[28:33] and after all of these years, you should
[28:35] realize that I'm not trying to to bring
[28:38] some doctrinal issue or something to pop
[28:40] up and make something out of myself or
[28:42] cuz it's done too late for all of that.
[28:44] We're we're done here in the end. Uh
[28:47] it's in him. All
[28:49] right. So, we're not expecting then
[28:52] something different to
[28:55] come, you
[28:57] know. And it's not some secret code
[29:00] secret coded things. You know, they they
[29:03] say now that they've broken some of the
[29:05] codes of the Bible and they could do
[29:06] this, they can do that, and they can
[29:07] prove this. That's all right. I don't
[29:09] understand it. But I'm not worried about
[29:10] the codes. I'm worried about the
[29:12] revelation. Right? And see in
[29:15] that, you know, we're not looking for
[29:18] another message to come or another
[29:20] messenger.
[29:22] But for this message to unfold, yes,
[29:25] unto us. Yes. That's why to me in let's
[29:29] see, I got it written somewhere in here.
[29:30] 1 Corinthians 15:52 say, "At the life's
[29:35] trump for the trumpet shall sound."
[29:39] I remember trying to preach that about
[29:40] 40 years ago and got in trouble. I
[29:42] probably will again, but it's all
[29:45] right. The at the last trump for the
[29:48] trumpet should sound. Why would the
[29:49] scripture say that? Well, it's just
[29:51] state that's going on. No, to me, it's
[29:54] saying it to give us
[29:57] understanding that out of all that the
[30:00] Bible is
[30:02] written, out of all the things that is
[30:04] brought forth by the prophet of
[30:07] God, I believe that there must be a
[30:10] personal revelation. Amen. Revealed to
[30:13] you and I as individuals
[30:17] about what that Bible has said, what the
[30:20] prophet has said. That's all I've ever
[30:22] tried to do. See, then at the last
[30:24] trump,
[30:26] for the trumpet shall sound. All right.
[30:29] Brother R said the last trumpet, life
[30:31] seal, life's angel's message, all the
[30:34] same and sounds at the same time. So,
[30:37] we're not looking for something else.
[30:40] We're going into the message to make
[30:43] sure that we understand. We have the
[30:46] message. See, uh, let me say it like
[30:48] this. Uh, it'll be this afternoon's
[30:50] message. How many times have you noticed
[30:52] that brother Brown said that you never
[30:54] sought God? He said, you never sought
[30:56] God. You never sought God. Said, cuz the
[30:59] Bible says that no man sought God.
[31:05] Ain't no scripture.
[31:08] He gone.
[31:11] There ain't no scripture says no man
[31:13] sought God.
[31:18] Look it up.
[31:22] It's not there. Time to use that. You
[31:25] got to you got to get the prophet what
[31:27] he's saying. Then you can get into it.
[31:29] Realize what Jesus was saying. You
[31:34] know, but there's no scripture that says
[31:36] no man saw
[31:38] God. If there is, come show me at the
[31:41] surface. I'll give you my computer to
[31:42] look it up with. You know, I'm not
[31:45] making that as sarcastic. I'm making as
[31:47] a point, right?
[31:49] We have a
[31:52] message that that messenger told us what
[31:57] the Bible was
[32:01] saying. Right.
[32:04] And and and in that he would say that
[32:07] the the the ends and the butts is in the
[32:09] right place of the Bible of the King
[32:10] James. Then he'd turn around and he'd
[32:12] say, "Now, this shouldn't have been a
[32:16] lie. It should have been the lie.
[32:20] said what is that other one uh won't
[32:22] hinder he said see it should have said
[32:25] prevent or whatever which was there in
[32:27] the scriptures you know see he's giving
[32:29] us the understanding he's opening our
[32:32] understanding we don't have to have
[32:34] another version of the Bible when maybe
[32:37] some of the other versions would have
[32:38] said
[32:40] that but he's telling us what it's
[32:43] saying so then we don't we can go back
[32:45] to him and say brother Random What does
[32:48] this
[32:50] mean?
[32:51] Hey, and I know people, you know, you
[32:54] going to go home, grab your Bible, and
[32:55] you going to start searching. I know
[32:56] it's in there. Like my wife told me, she
[32:59] said when we were reading the Bible
[33:01] years ago, she said, "The Bible says
[33:03] that that you won't be able to tell the
[33:05] difference in the season except from the
[33:07] shedding of the leaves and the bud of
[33:08] the trees." She said, "The Bible says
[33:11] it." I said, "Bible don't say it,
[33:14] honey." Well, I've been told it said it.
[33:16] I said, "Yeah, don't say
[33:18] it."
[33:19] See, I said, "Because the shedding of
[33:22] the leaves and the butting of the trees
[33:23] is the change of the weather." You know,
[33:26] that is the change is what causes those
[33:29] things. You heard it said that every tub
[33:30] will set on its own bottom. People swear
[33:33] by that. That's not in the
[33:36] Bible. You say, "Well, okay. Hey, come
[33:39] and show me now because I'm just honest.
[33:41] I'm just telling you, you won't find it.
[33:43] You know, better said to put your seed
[33:45] in the belly of the than it is to
[33:47] put it on the ground. Now, show me a
[33:49] Bible.
[33:50] I know the illustration, right? I know
[33:53] where the guy died for the situation.
[33:55] But the Bible don't say that cuz it'd be
[33:56] justifying prostitution.
[34:00] So, you see, we we get all tied up and
[34:02] we think, now that's what I saying a
[34:04] moment ago. If we don't show it down
[34:06] pure and
[34:07] unadulterated, we've got them little
[34:09] thoughts in there, right? Well, it's
[34:12] okay to be a prostitute cuz the Bible
[34:13] says better to sew or to go out and live
[34:15] with a prostitute cuz it says it's
[34:17] better put your seed in the belly of a
[34:19] That's not in the
[34:22] Bible. See, we swear by these. Mama told
[34:29] me, Brother Ray, he and I get into a lot
[34:31] about this cuz he'll come to me and ask
[34:33] me. He say, "So and so said so and so
[34:35] that brother Brown said." I said, "I
[34:36] can't find it." That's right. He said,
[34:40] "Well, I can't either." Well, every who
[34:43] heard it now heard it were their ears,
[34:46] but they didn't, you know, get it
[34:48] exactly right. All right, let's move on.
[34:51] Forget
[34:51] it. See, not a new
[34:54] message. That's right. Not a different
[34:57] message. But this message revealed what
[35:01] was the difference now between what the
[35:04] disciples had when Jesus opened their
[35:09] understanding. Are you listening? He
[35:12] opened their understanding. And I gave
[35:14] you, we went through the scriptures
[35:16] there. Read right down below where in
[35:18] Luke where it says that he opened their
[35:19] understanding. It tells you what he
[35:21] opened. Back up above there, it says he
[35:24] opened their understanding of the two
[35:25] disciples. Read what it says. He opened.
[35:28] He opened their understanding that he
[35:30] was going to die. You know, had to die.
[35:32] That he had to pay the price. That he
[35:34] would have to come back and salvation
[35:35] would be in his name. That's what he he
[35:38] didn't open the entire Bible.
[35:42] He just opened their understanding of
[35:43] that
[35:45] part. See, brother Random came to open
[35:49] our understanding of the entire Bible in
[35:51] the end time. That don't mean I
[35:53] understand it all. Oh, but that means he
[35:56] brought it unto us.
[35:59] All right. See, then we get to that
[36:01] place. See, we're not then we're not
[36:03] looking for another
[36:05] message, but something has got to come
[36:07] out of this message. As I said, what was
[36:10] the difference between what the
[36:11] disciples had their understanding open?
[36:14] Most everybody called that the new
[36:15] birth. Most everybody calls that a
[36:18] revelation. Come on. You're out there on
[36:20] the internet. You know what I'm saying?
[36:21] True. Your preacher is messing. You
[36:23] think that's a that's a revelation. Why
[36:26] did he have to go open it up there in
[36:28] the book of
[36:30] Acts? He opened their understanding in
[36:33] the book of Acts. The Holy Ghost did of
[36:35] who Jesus was.
[36:39] Uh who was it? Uh
[36:41] Paul, what's his name? Apollos.
[36:44] He was
[36:48] preaching about Jesus being
[36:51] raised and died for the people, etc.,
[37:04] etc., Peter, one of them came in contact
[37:06] with him. See, then the scriptures would
[37:08] open it up and he could receive the Holy
[37:10] Ghost. Right.
[37:12] See, what we need is a new birth to
[37:14] reveal to us what has been open to us.
[37:17] As I said, or Roberts University has the
[37:20] books to take. They could tell you
[37:22] everything. They have the computer. They
[37:24] could tell you everything right around
[37:26] said on a topic. That's true.
[37:31] But you know for sure that if they did,
[37:33] they'd have to leave that place.
[37:38] Now, follow me. So then with all that
[37:40] behind, see then when I get to it in a
[37:42] minute, then you going your brain will
[37:44] go. So just remember your brain's
[37:46] supposed to be cleaned of all that of
[37:48] you thinking brother Dale's going to try
[37:50] to come up with something different.
[37:51] Amen. All right. So let's go to what
[37:54] brother Brown had to say about it. See,
[37:57] cuz this is what we've already covered
[37:59] over and over, but I want to make sure
[38:01] you
[38:01] understand. See, cuz this is the
[38:03] background. If I just get the background
[38:05] this morning, I don't worry about it.
[38:07] I've quoted this to you, give it to you
[38:09] for many, many services where brother
[38:11] Brown said, "On Christ the mystery of
[38:13] God
[38:16] revealed, page
[38:18] 76, the kingdom of God is within you."
[38:21] And said the Bible, Jesus, the kingdom,
[38:25] we are not a denomination. We belong to
[38:27] a kingdom. And the kingdom is the word
[38:29] of God made spirit and life in your own
[38:31] life. Now, there's the answer. This
[38:34] kingdom is the revealed word. Amen.
[38:36] That's all what all Jesus is preaching
[38:38] of the kingdom. The kingdom. The
[38:39] kingdom. The kingdom. What is it? The
[38:41] revealed work. Praise. Amen. All right.
[38:44] It's not houses and buildings and
[38:45] apartments to live in. All
[38:48] right. See what is it? And the kingdom
[38:52] is a word of God made spirit and life in
[38:54] your own life, in our own life. That's
[38:57] right. Bringing to pass every promise in
[39:00] this day as it did in that day when the
[39:03] word and God was one. and the word and
[39:06] God is one in his church today. Amen.
[39:10] Now this is
[39:12] 63728 which is after the opening of the
[39:14] seals. Right?
[39:17] Okay. Listen to it.
[39:20] And the word and God is one in his
[39:22] church today, making it the
[39:26] headship of the body that is redeemed to
[39:30] bring the message in the last day and be
[39:34] taken up from the dead in the
[39:36] resurrection to go back and to restore
[39:38] against Adam and Eve in the Garden of
[39:40] Eden. All right.
[39:42] [Music]
[39:43] Now the
[39:47] headship see the revealed word is the
[39:50] headship. Right. Right. True. And it's
[39:54] to
[39:56] what? Headship of the body that is
[39:58] redeemed to bring the message. Now
[40:00] what's he talking about? Well, he's just
[40:02] talking about his
[40:04] message. Well, now he's saying that it's
[40:07] in the church, right?
[40:10] All right. His message is in the church,
[40:13] right?
[40:15] All right, we're going. We're fine.
[40:18] But this is after the seals broke. So
[40:21] he's talking about something to take
[40:23] place that is to
[40:27] bring something in the future.
[40:32] Right. Right. To
[40:35] bring the message in the last days and
[40:38] be taken up from the dead in the
[40:39] resurrection. Right.
[40:41] All
[40:42] right, look at the next one. It's the
[40:44] rise of the sun preached 1965 4:18 way
[40:47] after the seals
[40:49] broke. He's talking about Christ and the
[40:51] sheath wave and all the coming down. So
[40:53] the waving of the sheath. What was the
[40:54] sheath? The first one that come to
[40:56] maturity. The first one that proved it
[40:58] was a wheat that proved it was a sheath.
[41:00] Hallelujah. I'm sure you see what I'm
[41:03] talking about. It was waved over the
[41:06] people. And the first time there will
[41:09] come forth for the bride
[41:13] age. The first time there will come
[41:16] forth for the bright age, for a
[41:18] resurrection out of dark
[41:21] denominationalism will be a
[41:23] message that the fully maturity of the
[41:27] word has turned back again in its full
[41:31] power and been waved over the people by
[41:34] the same signs and wonders that he did
[41:36] back
[41:37] there. Now we know for sure brother is
[41:42] not the sheath wave. We don't cover him
[41:44] as a sheath wave here because that's
[41:45] where everybody wants to bring. They
[41:46] think that's the great revelation that
[41:48] they see brother around as a sheath
[41:49] wave. Right. No. And but he was waved.
[41:53] That's right. He was the first one to
[41:54] come to maturity. Amen. Cuz he brought
[41:57] the message. But Jesus is the sheep
[42:00] wave. Amen.
[42:02] But he brought the message and he could
[42:04] be waved over us. Come on. But he's
[42:06] talking about something here that will
[42:09] bring us out. the message that the full
[42:12] maturity of the word and has turned back
[42:15] again its full power. Right.
[42:18] That he's talking about something to be
[42:21] brought forth. That's right.
[42:24] That's why it's the rising of the sun.
[42:26] Amen.
[42:28] Proving his word 1965426.
[42:32] We've got to have a message sweep back
[42:35] and bring the people out of these
[42:37] denominational conditions back to the
[42:41] original genuine Pentecostal
[42:44] faith. And we're seeing it
[42:47] done. Listen, it's fulfilling of a
[42:53] scripture that has to come to
[42:58] pass. Did you read that one? It's a
[43:02] fulfilling of a
[43:03] scripture. Now once again, all scripture
[43:07] must be fulfilled.
[43:09] So there's a scripture related to this.
[43:14] I believe I gave it to you. Out of the
[43:16] last trump, you know, the last trumpet
[43:18] shall
[43:20] sound. See, not another message.
[43:25] It's revealing of God's word in the
[43:26] bride of Jesus Christ. Okay, look at
[43:29] union, the bride of Christ.
[43:33] pre 1965
[43:36] 11:25 and he's explaining coming down
[43:39] you know to elect lady notice this
[43:42] character when you see women just go on
[43:44] the rampage just doing anything they
[43:46] want to do watch the church is doing the
[43:48] same thing see notice but watch when the
[43:51] spiritual bride when she begins to have
[43:55] a
[43:57] revival now everybody
[44:00] body says revival's
[44:03] over and we agree to the world there
[44:08] will never be another revival. The next
[44:10] revival will be the 144,000
[44:14] in the tribulation. That's right.
[44:16] There's not another revival to the
[44:18] Gentiles. We agree. But watch it. Watch
[44:20] what he's saying now. Where did he ever
[44:22] do away with a revival for the bride?
[44:25] I've been having revival ever since I
[44:27] come in this message. Amen. In the past
[44:29] few years, I'm really into revival.
[44:31] Amen, Lord.
[44:34] That's right. Amen.
[44:36] Because you don't revive a sinner.
[44:38] That's right. Revival never was to get a
[44:41] was to revive a sinner. You can't revive
[44:43] a sinner. Revival was to get the people
[44:46] lined up, right? And the sinner start
[44:48] living right and acting right and doing
[44:50] right and repenting and they come and
[44:52] they want to repent, too. That's right.
[44:55] But look what he's saying. But watch
[44:57] when the spiritual bride, when she
[44:59] begins to have a revival, when she
[45:02] begins to come back and line herself up
[45:05] with the word of God. Amen. Watch then
[45:08] again. Now, this could not have been
[45:10] back there where the four the seals
[45:12] broke. And you say, "Well, that's what
[45:13] that
[45:15] was." Watch it. You see how that the
[45:19] scriptures at that D at that time there
[45:24] will be a message sweep out to catch
[45:26] that bride catch that woman elect for as
[45:29] the world see Satan's deceiver and all
[45:31] like that who deceive the first by
[45:33] sinning God by misbelieving his word
[45:38] I'm looking for a revival but I'm in the
[45:41] revival you remember the welts man
[45:44] standing there you know with his keys
[45:45] slinging around around of revival. He
[45:47] said, "You're looking at it, right?" But
[45:50] see, we think revival means dead,
[45:53] raised, sick, healed, uh, manifestation,
[45:56] sinner, repentant,
[45:57] etc. Why can't we have a personal
[45:59] revival over the opening of this
[46:01] message, right? Amen.
[46:04] Come on. What's the problem?
[46:06] Then when people do see the fire
[46:08] burning, they will come. Because, let me
[46:11] quote brother Random. I didn't bring it,
[46:13] but let me quote him again. He said, "I
[46:15] don't know how many will be saved in
[46:17] that life moment." That's right. To
[46:20] rapture
[46:22] the church. Is that a quote? Amen.
[46:26] Thank you, Jesus. What are you
[46:27] expecting, brother? I thought one day
[46:29] you said redemption is over when you
[46:32] ain't never heard me say nothing like
[46:33] that. Where'd you get
[46:38] it? Your prophet said he didn't know how
[46:40] many to be saved in that last moment.
[46:42] Right.
[46:45] You said well saved means now you going
[46:47] to go ahead and try to explain every bit
[46:49] of
[46:50] it. See that's where our trouble is.
[46:53] When something is said our minds run our
[46:55] computer and we got quote quote quotes
[46:57] run across the screen in front of our
[46:58] brain and we
[47:00] just and never listening.
[47:03] Did you notice what he
[47:05] said proving his word? He said it's
[47:09] fulfilling of a scripture that has to
[47:12] come to
[47:14] pass here. He just said that the
[47:18] scripture tells you at that time
[47:21] there'll sweep out a
[47:24] message.
[47:28] me. I've always looked for
[47:31] that and long for a group of people to
[47:34] be able to just settle down and listen
[47:36] to the
[47:38] word. You don't want to sign them under
[47:40] 100, brother Dale. I'm not concerned
[47:42] about that because Satan can impersonate
[47:44] every bit of it, but he cannot
[47:46] impersonate that word. Amen. He can't be
[47:49] the Holy Ghost, so I ain't going to
[47:50] worry about it. And he can't bring the
[47:52] word pure and
[47:53] unadulterated. That's right.
[47:56] It can't be
[47:57] done. See? See? Then I wrote it like
[48:00] this. See? See what I'm talking about?
[48:04] Truly, this message is not a new
[48:07] message, but the message that has been
[48:10] brought to us, revealed or fulfilled.
[48:13] Mhm.
[48:17] The fully matured word we read.
[48:23] Seem see when the bride becomes the word
[48:25] I've taught you all the way down how do
[48:27] we get the statue of perfect man it's
[48:29] can only be done by the revealing of
[48:31] God's word right it's not done done
[48:33] because you train yourself into it
[48:37] exactly right it's not done because we
[48:39] study and put it come on but if we don't
[48:42] study and all it's not going to work
[48:45] we're going to get that in a minute so
[48:46] we're going we're going to divide a line
[48:47] here in a minute that I hope you'll
[48:50] follow Amen.
[48:53] See, then what we need in this day is to
[48:57] get our understanding opened as to what
[49:00] to
[49:01] expect. And that's where the five-fold
[49:04] ministry to me is failing, right?
[49:06] They're not programming the people,
[49:08] right? And that's a bad word to use cuz
[49:10] people program them. They spoke to me
[49:13] revelation.
[49:15] Bring you to
[49:17] understand. I can't reveal it. You can't
[49:19] either. You get that off your mind,
[49:21] you'll be better off.
[49:24] Brother Random couldn't reveal it. Jesus
[49:26] said, "My own life, Brother Rand, I'm
[49:28] quoting him, did not reveal that unto
[49:30] thee." Cuz only the Holy Ghost is a
[49:32] revealer. Christ mystery God revealed.
[49:35] Amen.
[49:37] Believe it's 45.
[49:40] Only the Holy Ghost is a revealer.
[49:42] That's right.
[49:44] All Jesus could do was open our
[49:46] understanding. Right. Mhm.
[49:51] All
[49:52] right. But see, we think hearing the
[49:54] message is
[50:00] revelation. All
[50:01] right. Now, I'm going to make something
[50:04] personal right here. So, go ahead and do
[50:05] what you want to do. See, we need our
[50:07] understanding to be opened of the plan
[50:10] of redemption of the whole being, body,
[50:13] spirit, soul, world, etc. Well, wait a
[50:15] minute. I read the seal book.
[50:18] I was listening to brother Richard on
[50:19] the tape last night. He said people say,
[50:21] "Well, I read the seal a book. I know
[50:22] all about redemption. Been the message
[50:25] two
[50:30] weeks. Know all about it." Notice all
[50:34] these young preachers come in. What?
[50:35] Straighten it out. Everybody. Oh
[50:38] my. Oh my.
[50:41] Just give them time and get straightened
[50:42] out or whatever.
[50:45] But
[50:46] listen, here's something I want to speak
[50:48] to you personal for a minute. I think
[50:50] it's time for the latter
[50:53] rain. Now, are you listening? I think
[50:56] it's time for the latter rain to fall to
[50:59] quicken the word that we have in the
[51:02] field. Amen. It must be first planted in
[51:05] the field, pure and
[51:07] unadulterated from any man's ideas.
[51:14] All right. Do you see what I mean? Yes.
[51:18] See, to you and I, we have to get the
[51:20] understanding of
[51:22] redemption, which we must understand it
[51:25] to then the body change can come. Right?
[51:30] Only after our understanding has been
[51:33] opened that it can quicken. That's
[51:34] right. Amen. I believe that the revealed
[51:37] word and not the letter will change this
[51:42] whole being that we are. That's right.
[51:45] Cuz I believe that's what changed our
[51:46] being in the new birth. Right. Was a
[51:48] revealed word. Amen. I believe the new
[51:50] birth is a revelation of God's word.
[51:52] That's right. That changed your soul and
[51:53] made your soul eternal. Amen. All right.
[51:56] So, it would have to continue on. That's
[51:58] what I've been trying to do and will
[52:00] continue to do is preach the message to
[52:02] the place that God can reveal it to us.
[52:06] See, because he uses the five-fold
[52:09] ministry to open our understanding of
[52:12] the message.
[52:16] Remember, he cannot reveal part word and
[52:19] part error because that is hybrid hybrid
[52:22] seed. Amen. All right.
[52:26] With that in mind,
[52:28] now of all I've laid in the
[52:30] background, let me just try to say
[52:32] something to you. So, let's go back to
[52:36] Ephesians. You'll see that I have been
[52:38] wanting to to speak on that. Let's see
[52:40] that if he'll open under our
[52:43] understanding so that it can be made
[52:47] alive. So, in Ephesians 1:3, we've been
[52:51] reading. See, we could stay for an hours
[52:53] on the godhead. Let's be the God and
[52:57] father. Translate that word and into the
[53:00] word even because it can be used as
[53:02] even. All right. God, even father of our
[53:08] Lord Jesus Christ. I'm bringing three
[53:11] people into being. It's a revelation of
[53:14] one true and living
[53:15] God. Now, watch what he's done. who has
[53:18] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[53:20] in heavenly places. Where?
[53:24] Oh, glory. Heavenly places. We're just
[53:27] Glory. Where's it at? It says in Christ.
[53:30] Right.
[53:33] In Christ. Right.
[53:37] I looked at one or two yesterday. This I
[53:39] thought, well, surely people understand
[53:40] this. Right around said, outside of
[53:42] Christ, we're worth nothing. That's
[53:43] right. So if you don't understand that,
[53:45] you got a problem in your mental
[53:46] capacity, let alone anything else. If
[53:48] you think you're something without
[53:50] Christ. That's right. Amen. Cuz he's the
[53:52] only one worth anything.
[53:55] All right. But look
[53:58] now, who has blessed us with all
[54:01] spiritual blessings in heavenly places.
[54:04] Now, Brother Brown, I gave you the
[54:07] quotes from there, right? What is
[54:09] heavenly places, brother Brown? on page
[54:12] number uh five on your notes, page 29,
[54:15] Christ mystery, God revealed. It's the
[54:17] believer's position in Christ. Amen.
[54:22] It's not shouting glory, hallelujah, and
[54:25] the the we feel it and we're running
[54:27] with it and all that, you know, all of
[54:28] these things. Oh, glory, we're in
[54:30] heavenly places.
[54:34] It's being in Christ. Amen.
[54:39] The end of all that shout and glory
[54:40] hallelujah is there. Wonderful. That's
[54:42] right. That's right. You remember what
[54:44] the prophet said. It's all right. Just
[54:47] get up there and shout glory hallelujah.
[54:48] But make sure you walk straight and you
[54:50] come back down. Now that's as good a
[54:52] definition of Christianity as I could
[54:54] ever hear in my life. That's right. Cuz
[54:56] that's always stuck with me. Just make
[54:59] sure you walk straight, you come back
[55:00] down. That's right. All right. Paul is
[55:03] trying to tell us that we're in heavenly
[55:05] places, that we've been put in heavenly
[55:09] places in Jesus Christ.
[55:14] Not in ourselves or our own ideas,
[55:16] right? But it's the believer's position,
[55:18] the right hand of the father. How much
[55:20] more do we need? Amen. All right. Going
[55:23] to the next one of the message. E uh 12
[55:26] of Abraham and his seat after him in
[55:28] 6143.
[55:31] How do we get into Christ? 1 Corinthians
[55:35] 12, what? By one spirit, we're baptized
[55:38] into one body, right? Which is in the
[55:41] body of Christ. All right. Now, the only
[55:44] way to get into heavenly places is to be
[55:47] born again, right? The only way to
[55:50] receive a revelation of God's word to
[55:53] change us or anything. You can get a
[55:54] revelation of healings. You can get a
[55:56] revelation of something taking place,
[55:58] etc., etc., because it's in the Bible.
[56:00] But you can't get a re a Holy Ghost born
[56:03] again experience revelation without it
[56:05] being the word revealed to you. I don't
[56:07] believe in it. You say, "Well, brother
[56:10] Dale, I shouted, I cried." Okay. All
[56:12] right. Wonderful. That's what the baby
[56:14] does after it gets here. Give me the
[56:15] birth of the baby.
[56:18] The baby crying and screaming is not its
[56:20] birth. That's right. Get the baby here.
[56:24] Let it do what it wants to do. That's
[56:27] evidences.
[56:29] I want to know what the birth is.
[56:33] Right. It's the birth of the word. Amen.
[56:36] All right. Heavenly places is the
[56:38] believer's position in Christ. Amen.
[56:42] Now, now verse
[56:46] four, according as he hath chosen
[56:50] us in him.
[56:56] You know, they even put in fores in the
[56:59] Scoffield Bibles around the word
[57:01] in. And I'm assuming that they would
[57:04] probably put it there maybe thinking you
[57:05] would use the word by. But we'll get to
[57:08] that in a second. That won't
[57:10] work. According as he had chosen us in
[57:12] him when before the foundation of the
[57:18] world. What? that we should be
[57:21] holy and without
[57:23] blame before him in love. Now, how can a
[57:26] human mortal be holy in love?
[57:31] There's no way. That's right.
[57:34] Our scripture said our righteousness is
[57:36] what? As filthy rags. That's right.
[57:38] That's right. But around said, Hebrews
[57:40] series, I'll find it for you. He said,
[57:42] "I'd hate to think that I was born 5
[57:44] minutes ago." Now, what could a 5-minute
[57:46] old baby do?
[57:49] kind of odd. That's kind of what the
[57:50] Catholics let these abortion babies
[57:52] about the women that's there, you know,
[57:54] they let them live for just a few
[57:55] minutes and then they kill them.
[57:58] He said,
[57:59] "What would it be for 5 minutes?" You
[58:02] know, what could a 5-minute old baby
[58:04] do? He said, "I hate to have face God
[58:07] that way."
[58:09] You know why? Cuz you're born in sin,
[58:11] checking in iniquity. Now, we know
[58:13] babies going to heaven. We know the
[58:14] whole side of the story. We sit there
[58:16] before your computer go brother don't
[58:19] understand. We believe all that is going
[58:21] to happen. You don't you're not
[58:23] listening to what I'm
[58:24] saying. You're not listening to what run
[58:26] around say. He said I'd hate to face God
[58:30] with that. He said cuz I was born in sin
[58:33] shaping and iniquity. I was lost. Amen.
[58:38] But you see we just run fast forward
[58:41] to what we want to
[58:43] believe. Now, God can't quicken what we
[58:45] want to believe. That's right. Amen. But
[58:48] see, notice now it says what? That we
[58:50] were chosen in him.
[58:54] Now, I said they put a parenthesis
[58:55] around the end if you're looking at the
[58:56] Scoffield Bible. Maybe they want to
[58:59] emphasize the basis of something. I
[59:00] don't know. But maybe they want to try
[59:03] because the word by and in can be
[59:06] translated where it says over in Hebrews
[59:09] 1 that he spoken times in or by the
[59:14] prophets. See, but it's not necessarily
[59:17] everything. Every time that you see the
[59:19] word and cannot be translated even,
[59:21] right? It can only be translated that on
[59:24] occasions that where it fits the the
[59:26] background of what it's talking about.
[59:28] All right. Yes.
[59:30] Now, so we're predestinated. I mean,
[59:32] we're chosen in
[59:34] him and it was done before the
[59:36] foundation of the world. Right? Now,
[59:39] listen, our
[59:42] mind, all right, you're going to have to
[59:44] just listen cuz I'm not a doctor. I'm
[59:45] not I'm just a preacher of the gospel
[59:47] and do the best I can. I tried it on my
[59:48] wife and that's what I wanted to do to
[59:50] see how her her reactions was to my
[59:53] natural wording.
[59:57] It doesn't say that we were chosen by
[1:00:01] him, but that's what our mind
[1:00:07] thinks. Our mind thinks we were chosen
[1:00:09] by
[1:00:15] him. You said, "No, no, no. I can
[1:00:19] read." Yeah, but your mind interprets.
[1:00:23] Why is it that five people can see a car
[1:00:25] wreck and there's five different
[1:00:26] interpretations of what they all saw.
[1:00:30] Right.
[1:00:33] That's what a guy said one time. I
[1:00:34] remember reading. He said, you know, if
[1:00:36] you commit a crime, he said, just hang
[1:00:38] around. You know, they ask him, he's a
[1:00:41] gangster, kill people. You know, he
[1:00:42] said, he said, just hang around. See if
[1:00:44] you going to run it at all. They figure
[1:00:45] it's you. He said, just hang
[1:00:48] around. He said, "People ain't going to
[1:00:50] know what's going on." He said, "Didn't
[1:00:52] you see he's
[1:00:56] off?" Cuz see our mind that was a red
[1:00:59] car. No, it wasn't. Where's Lisa? Lisa
[1:01:02] used to tell Ter that was a blue car.
[1:01:04] And he said, "No, it's not a blue car.
[1:01:06] It was a red car." And then her foot
[1:01:08] would go up and down cuz it was it was
[1:01:11] it might have been a blue one, but you
[1:01:13] know what a red one. I'm just trying to
[1:01:15] illustrate. Okay. See our
[1:01:19] mind, our eyes, a portion of our brain
[1:01:22] reads one
[1:01:24] thing. The subconscal parts of our brain
[1:01:28] interprets to us what is being said or
[1:01:32] read. You're
[1:01:33] reading. Now you say, well, what would
[1:01:36] be the difference in chosen by
[1:01:39] him or chosen in him? Chosen. If you're
[1:01:42] chosen by him, you're not a part of him,
[1:01:44] right?
[1:01:48] Okay, we're going
[1:01:51] now. If you're chosen by him, we're
[1:01:54] going to we're going to get to some
[1:01:55] things in a minute or we'll get it this
[1:01:58] afternoon. And I'm just going to talk to
[1:02:00] you cuz a lot of this I don't have a
[1:02:01] wrote down period. I wouldn't write
[1:02:04] it. But if you think you were chosen by
[1:02:09] him, you don't have no scripture
[1:02:13] because that would make him choosing
[1:02:15] you. That's right. Mhm.
[1:02:18] Perspective. Perspective. The Bible
[1:02:20] doesn't say that. That's right. It says
[1:02:23] you were chosen in him. Amen. Amen.
[1:02:27] Thank you, Jesus. Okay.
[1:02:32] Now, see, our mind tells us things that
[1:02:36] we
[1:02:40] read. Now we read here that the choosing
[1:02:44] even
[1:02:45] itself took
[1:02:47] place before the foundation of the
[1:02:50] world. Right
[1:02:54] now there are some quotes I have them
[1:02:56] laying back there but I'm going to go
[1:02:58] with
[1:02:59] it. Brother R said see the said it was
[1:03:02] before the
[1:03:05] world. He said then how could you
[1:03:07] choose?
[1:03:14] Are you
[1:03:15] listening? If it was before the world,
[1:03:18] how could you
[1:03:24] choose? What part of you was back there
[1:03:26] to
[1:03:29] choose? You got a little drawing that I
[1:03:32] gave to you with some lines on it. And
[1:03:35] choosing is on this side for us.
[1:03:40] It's over in
[1:03:43] time. Very poor example of what I wanted
[1:03:46] to bring out, but still it gets the
[1:03:51] point. And so, Brother Dale, you just
[1:03:53] don't
[1:03:54] [Music]
[1:03:55] understand.
[1:03:57] Now, this was the question I asked my
[1:03:59] wife. I said, "Honey, what what do you
[1:04:01] think
[1:04:02] about that we were chosen in
[1:04:05] him?" Hard to get it correct. chose us
[1:04:08] in him to make sure people
[1:04:10] don't want to garbage with
[1:04:14] that. She said, "Well, honey said, I
[1:04:16] understand that believe predestination,
[1:04:18] fornowledge, and
[1:04:20] things, but she said, I I don't fully
[1:04:23] understand the
[1:04:29] choosing until the Lord revealed this to
[1:04:31] me. I didn't either." Uh
[1:04:34] yeah, I spoke about it. I done the best
[1:04:36] I could because there is ways and one
[1:04:39] thing for sure when I get through with
[1:04:41] this I'm saying it up front. What we've
[1:04:44] taught about predestination and
[1:04:46] fornowledge is
[1:04:49] correct. But it's time to move on a
[1:04:52] step, right?
[1:04:54] Brother said to me the other day, he
[1:04:56] said, "Brother Dale, you're not through
[1:04:57] finished with predest with uh
[1:05:00] predestination." And I said, "No, shall
[1:05:05] not." But now
[1:05:10] listen. The Bible says plainly now that
[1:05:13] we were chosen in
[1:05:16] him. He chose us in him or chosen us in
[1:05:22] him. See, it's a past tense form. Hath
[1:05:25] already done. It was done before the
[1:05:27] world ever begun.
[1:05:32] Now, I believe our biggest problem
[1:05:37] is we're on this side of
[1:05:41] eternity. You
[1:05:44] know, trying to figure out what took
[1:05:47] place on the other side of eternity.
[1:05:50] That's why I gave you the drawing there
[1:05:52] and I put it in the middle the beginning
[1:05:53] because you know what brother Random see
[1:05:55] will cover that cuz he even covers back
[1:05:57] the beginning as being uh back before uh
[1:06:01] Genesis 1 and then he covered it as
[1:06:03] being Genesis 1 and it just keeps coming
[1:06:06] down.
[1:06:10] Now we know for a certainty
[1:06:13] that there was a time that God dwelt
[1:06:16] alone.
[1:06:18] Right? All
[1:06:23] right. All right. He had his attributes
[1:06:26] within him. I gave it to you number
[1:06:29] seven.
[1:06:31] Um when manifested sons of God preach
[1:06:36] 1960 that his attributes is his
[1:06:41] nature. His
[1:06:44] nature.
[1:06:46] Right? Now, he already had those
[1:06:48] attributes. He never gained attributes
[1:06:50] when he came into the
[1:06:57] world. Now, you're going to have to
[1:06:59] swallow. So, swallow real hard and take
[1:07:00] this
[1:07:01] one. His attributes are
[1:07:08] eternal. Now, one of these days, I want
[1:07:10] to preach on something the Lord spoke to
[1:07:12] me about yesterday.
[1:07:15] You know, in healing, we're trying to
[1:07:17] get healed.
[1:07:21] Brother Brown said, "Your healing is
[1:07:23] eternal."
[1:07:26] Now, wait a minute. See, you can be sick
[1:07:30] today and healed and then sick again and
[1:07:33] see, you're not listening.
[1:07:39] If you've ever healed, God done the
[1:07:41] healing. That's right. Amen. Amen.
[1:07:45] Saw
[1:07:47] that. See, I said maybe one of these
[1:07:49] days we'll get back to
[1:07:51] that. All
[1:07:54] right. Now, we know for a
[1:07:57] certainty that according to who is this?
[1:08:00] Mechzedc. I didn't give you these cuz
[1:08:01] surely you already know it. That brother
[1:08:03] R said we we bypassed our
[1:08:06] theophony but he come in his theophony.
[1:08:12] Theophony is a word form
[1:08:15] body. He said we didn't come that way.
[1:08:18] We become that here. Are you listening?
[1:08:21] Yes. Amen. So then here goes our
[1:08:24] computer. We never was the
[1:08:26] word. Now you've lost the whole message
[1:08:29] of who this
[1:08:31] mech brother says if you was not the
[1:08:35] word in the
[1:08:37] beginning you will never be the word.
[1:08:40] Amen. That's right.
[1:08:44] Okay. Yes.
[1:08:46] See, we didn't come in a theophony word
[1:08:49] body to stand there. We were in him.
[1:08:54] Amen. Amen.
[1:08:56] Cuz he was the fullness of the godhead
[1:08:58] bodily. He was the word.
[1:09:02] We were in him. Amen. Or we never will
[1:09:05] be in him. That's not in him. Where does
[1:09:07] eternal life that you have today come
[1:09:08] from?
[1:09:13] And sure enough of the devil cuz he he
[1:09:15] couldn't do
[1:09:19] that. See, that's where we're missing
[1:09:21] the whole plan of redemption by our
[1:09:23] minds that we've we've so studied until
[1:09:26] we've got it in there. But yet our
[1:09:28] computers minds, they just run haywire
[1:09:30] with us about quotes instead of sitting
[1:09:32] down and simply thinking things over.
[1:09:34] You know what I do sometime? And the
[1:09:36] wife came in yesterday and she
[1:09:38] said, "You asleep late?" Said,
[1:09:44] "No." You know what I was doing? laying
[1:09:48] back in my chair, had the head laid
[1:09:49] back, had my eyes
[1:09:54] closed. You know, I like to do that. I
[1:09:57] love to get out in the
[1:09:59] woods, sit up there on that deer stand
[1:10:01] and
[1:10:02] just four
[1:10:05] hours and just
[1:10:08] think about what God has done, right?
[1:10:14] And how he's done
[1:10:16] it and what he's used to do it
[1:10:19] with and just think over the
[1:10:24] things. Well, brother, when I start
[1:10:26] doing that, the devil start Yeah. He g
[1:10:29] me, too. He starts putting in things
[1:10:30] that ain't no
[1:10:33] good. And about the time that I really
[1:10:36] get down to considering a whole lot
[1:10:37] about what I'm thinking about, a deer
[1:10:39] shows up and it messes everything up cuz
[1:10:42] I'm human. All
[1:10:45] right. But, you know, we do good
[1:10:47] sometimes to just sit down and think
[1:10:48] about what been revealed to us. Amen.
[1:10:53] You don't never do that. Just sit down
[1:10:55] and think about it. Do you ever thank
[1:10:57] God for what he's revealed to you? Amen.
[1:11:01] I thank him every day. Yes. Over and
[1:11:05] over for what he's revealed. Yes.
[1:11:10] Yes. But you see, he never gained
[1:11:14] attributes. So he had those attributes.
[1:11:16] Yes.
[1:11:18] He was already a savior.
[1:11:22] But there was nothing that needed
[1:11:24] saving. That doesn't change that he was
[1:11:26] already the
[1:11:30] savior. He was a healer, but there was
[1:11:33] nothing that needed to be healed. That
[1:11:36] doesn't change
[1:11:40] that. His
[1:11:43] thoughts are eternal.
[1:11:48] They are not like the prophet said
[1:11:50] church age book a man with a blueprint
[1:11:53] that lays out what he's going to build a
[1:11:54] house you know and then he proceeds to
[1:11:56] build it. He said not like that. He said
[1:11:58] his thoughts are eternal and part of
[1:12:06] him. See we're only displaying on this
[1:12:10] side of the line of what we draw out.
[1:12:13] You'll see some things. We are on the
[1:12:15] line of displaying the
[1:12:18] attributes. He was on the side
[1:12:21] of the
[1:12:24] attribute. I gave it to you. Page nine
[1:12:26] of page 149 of church a book that his
[1:12:29] thoughts are
[1:12:32] eternal. I gave you that one on number
[1:12:36] eight of your notes, page 16, Christ the
[1:12:38] mystery, that those attributes were in
[1:12:41] God.
[1:12:46] See, then we read now that we were
[1:12:48] chosen in
[1:12:53] him. I hope you're beginning to realize
[1:12:55] that we could not be chosen. It wasn't
[1:12:57] the fact that we were chosen by him
[1:13:00] because if we were chosen by him that
[1:13:02] would separate us. That's right.
[1:13:05] Cuz that would mean something being
[1:13:07] chosen, you know, in a different
[1:13:09] situation, right?
[1:13:12] but to be chosen in
[1:13:14] him. It's not like somebody taking up
[1:13:17] sides and choosing which would be on
[1:13:19] what side and what would be. You've
[1:13:20] heard brother R say that. He said it's
[1:13:22] not the fact that he sat down and chose
[1:13:23] arm and Neville and didn't choose this
[1:13:25] other brother. He said it didn't work.
[1:13:31] Right? Jacob have I love and Esau have I
[1:13:34] hated.
[1:13:37] You know what we
[1:13:38] do? We've been trained and I trained
[1:13:42] you. So I got to train you another step
[1:13:44] upward. Okay. Okay.
[1:13:47] That is by fornowledge.
[1:13:51] Amen. Remember predestination.
[1:13:54] He predestinates by his fornowledge.
[1:13:56] Fore is before predestination.
[1:14:00] You agree?
[1:14:02] If not then you'd have him you transfer
[1:14:05] the words. So he predestinates by his
[1:14:08] fornowledge. For knowledge existed
[1:14:10] before predetermining come into
[1:14:12] thinking, right? Mhm.
[1:14:15] So you look on your
[1:14:17] drawing and you'll see some
[1:14:21] things that I want you to think
[1:14:25] about. for
[1:14:29] knowledge was God in
[1:14:34] eternity that was capable because of
[1:14:37] being God. That's right. Infinite finite
[1:14:41] idea what those words
[1:14:45] are that he could have a fornowledge of
[1:14:48] everything that would be in the
[1:14:51] world. And that's why the thing formed
[1:14:53] can't say why did you form this way cuz
[1:14:54] it didn't form us that way. We formed
[1:14:56] ourselves. We've been through it. Right.
[1:14:58] That's
[1:15:02] right. The
[1:15:05] fornowledge. All right. We put another
[1:15:07] little word there that's in eternity.
[1:15:12] Predestination.
[1:15:15] Right. We put down chosen in him. All
[1:15:19] this is before the world.
[1:15:22] You're a part of God
[1:15:25] before the world or you'll never be part
[1:15:26] of God. That's right. Amen. Your name
[1:15:30] was written in the lounge book of life
[1:15:32] before the world ever begun or it will
[1:15:34] never be written there.
[1:15:38] This is the one we're heading down
[1:15:39] towards. You were glorified in him
[1:15:43] before the world. Amen. You were
[1:15:46] justified in him before the world. Now,
[1:15:50] I didn't brother Joe corrected this to
[1:15:53] where we would have the correct wording
[1:15:55] of it. The next I put son of God, plan
[1:15:58] of redemption. See, but really that
[1:16:00] should have been sons plural. So, you
[1:16:02] know, you translate it yourself. He
[1:16:04] translated on the computer for me
[1:16:06] because I'd rather it be using the word
[1:16:07] sons of God because my reference there
[1:16:10] is to where that the morning stars sang
[1:16:13] together and the sons of God shouted for
[1:16:15] joy. And that was before the
[1:16:19] world. That was in
[1:16:23] eternity. That's what brother Ram
[1:16:26] says. See the seed are
[1:16:30] word. Now we'll get back to that one on
[1:16:32] the sons of God. Cuz brother Random says
[1:16:35] and see that's why we got a prophet to
[1:16:36] say it. He said that's when they seen
[1:16:39] the plan of redemption come into view.
[1:16:50] Wait a minute. Now you're getting us too
[1:16:51] close now.
[1:16:55] It's the seed or word that comes
[1:16:57] predestinated eternally and not the
[1:17:00] person, right? Okay. Christ the mystery
[1:17:04] of God revealed God had a
[1:17:08] plan a hidden
[1:17:11] mystery that he was going to 1617 Christ
[1:17:15] a mystery he was going to see it
[1:17:19] happen he had a purpose in doing that to
[1:17:22] let himself be
[1:17:26] revealed that's a plan and a purpose
[1:17:35] Now for knowledge of
[1:17:40] God to make it to word that he wouldn't
[1:17:43] predestinate according to his
[1:17:46] desires cuz he desired everybody to
[1:17:48] save.
[1:17:51] So by his
[1:17:54] fornowledge he could predict determine.
[1:17:57] That's right.
[1:17:59] because his fornowledge was a knowledge
[1:18:01] of your choice. Right? You go with me?
[1:18:04] Amen.
[1:18:07] So he could
[1:18:09] predestinate according to your desire.
[1:18:11] Right.
[1:18:23] Okay. So then for knowledge
[1:18:30] has to do with the
[1:18:32] fact that something would have to take
[1:18:35] place here
[1:18:39] because that's his fornowledge right
[1:18:42] now. Listen with
[1:18:44] me. I ain't got the key yet. I'm
[1:18:48] just we're still standing outside the
[1:18:50] door trying to get a hold of the key,
[1:18:51] but we're getting a
[1:18:56] place for knowledge of God is of what
[1:19:00] you will
[1:19:02] do or not do or whatever. You agree?
[1:19:06] Yes. Yes.
[1:19:09] So, we're not losing our understanding
[1:19:10] of fornowledge and predestinations and
[1:19:13] and you
[1:19:15] know, we're trying to get an
[1:19:17] understanding. Yes.
[1:19:20] For knowledge means God before the world
[1:19:22] had a
[1:19:23] knowledge of what would be here in time.
[1:19:29] You agree?
[1:19:32] Okay.
[1:19:34] Predestination sitting back
[1:19:39] there is would be the destiny of the
[1:19:42] individual that would come over
[1:19:47] here because predestination means
[1:19:51] destiny determined
[1:19:56] beforehand. Now you're going to catch on
[1:19:58] a minute. And I hope that you're going
[1:19:59] to look at the right hand side and
[1:20:00] you're going to say, "Glory, I'm
[1:20:05] here." Because this is the only way God
[1:20:08] could do it without it being wrong.
[1:20:19] We were chosen in him, the Bible said,
[1:20:21] before the world. Right.
[1:20:25] Now, here's where we really got to
[1:20:26] think.
[1:20:27] I don't know where to stop that
[1:20:32] clock. I'll get this one. I can't get no
[1:20:34] more.
[1:20:38] No. See, we've we're we're so trained
[1:20:40] about our
[1:20:42] mind
[1:20:44] that we we make it look
[1:20:48] like that all of our doing was in vain.
[1:20:58] See, quickly you say something. You say,
[1:21:01] "Well, I saw God." Well, now brother,
[1:21:02] let me explain that to you now. Now, let
[1:21:04] me explain. Said the Bible says, "No man
[1:21:08] go dark." Then just look back at him and
[1:21:10] say, "Not going to say that."
[1:21:12] Go find
[1:21:16] it. But you
[1:21:18] see, as quick as we say something, your
[1:21:20] mind goes, "Come mind, too." It's the
[1:21:22] same thing talking to you. It just like
[1:21:23] that. is just going cuz that's your
[1:21:25] mind.
[1:21:27] It has to be
[1:21:29] controlled. That's why when brother
[1:21:31] Moses I told you when he when he put my
[1:21:33] heart against the wall and he said,
[1:21:34] "What do you believe about God?" I said,
[1:21:35] "God three person." He said, "You're a
[1:21:37] trinity as anybody else." Personality,
[1:21:40] personality, individual individuals
[1:21:42] person. Bless God. My theology don't say
[1:21:45] that. The the
[1:21:47] theologians. No. I said you're right.
[1:21:49] And I don't believe
[1:21:51] that cuz I didn't let my mind run to
[1:21:54] what I thought was right. I saw he was
[1:21:57] right. Right. So if we'd ever get to
[1:22:00] that
[1:22:10] basalt
[1:22:13] God until you get people to the bases
[1:22:15] they don't seek God. Right. That's
[1:22:18] right.
[1:22:26] That's right. You didn't seek God, but
[1:22:28] you know what you
[1:22:29] did? How many of you remember? How many
[1:22:32] of you remember in your life as a
[1:22:34] Christian when you were coming up to the
[1:22:36] new birth and
[1:22:38] things and you were crying and praying
[1:22:41] and fasting and reading and you were
[1:22:44] doing everything you could do. You was
[1:22:46] repenting of this and repenting of that.
[1:22:48] You were getting rid of everything,
[1:22:50] trying to get cleaned up enough to get
[1:22:52] saved,
[1:22:53] right? And you know, if you hadn't never
[1:22:55] done that, you know what? You would have
[1:22:57] never got
[1:23:02] saved. But I thought it was this
[1:23:05] way. See, that's
[1:23:07] where our mind is transmitted it over to
[1:23:11] the wrong place.
[1:23:16] Brother Brandon wasn't saying what we
[1:23:22] thought when we think and say, "Well,
[1:23:24] well, no, no, we we read the message.
[1:23:26] We've been programmed to the basis that
[1:23:28] we never saw God, so why take my kids to
[1:23:31] church?"
[1:23:33] You know that the Baptists had a
[1:23:34] doctrine back hundreds of years ago that
[1:23:37] they would not. It was kind of in the
[1:23:38] primitive styles that they wouldn't take
[1:23:40] their children to church at a revival
[1:23:42] especially. You know why? Cuz they
[1:23:45] afraid they might get saved when God
[1:23:47] didn't know they'd get saved. Now you
[1:23:49] like that's exactly the
[1:23:52] doctrine. Well, I don't want to take my
[1:23:54] kids cuz they might get saved. God might
[1:23:55] not want him saved.
[1:23:59] So just leave him at home.
[1:24:04] How
[1:24:05] dumb can we be? That's right. Of
[1:24:09] spiritual understanding,
[1:24:12] right?
[1:24:14] [Music]
[1:24:16] But you
[1:24:17] see, if you had not prayed and cried and
[1:24:22] longed after God, you would have never
[1:24:24] got him.
[1:24:30] Now I want you if you don't believe that
[1:24:32] now I know your mind clicked. So let's
[1:24:34] click
[1:24:36] it. How come there was 120 got the Holy
[1:24:39] Ghost in the upper room when 500
[1:24:42] brethren as I said a while ago seen him
[1:24:44] after his resurrection? It
[1:24:46] says why didn't they go to the upper
[1:24:50] room something's wrong was it? All
[1:24:53] right. Now get the answer to the rest of
[1:24:54] it. Why didn't God give the 500?
[1:24:58] They didn't go. Cuz they wouldn't in the
[1:25:00] upper room.
[1:25:04] Said, "Oh, brother, that was deep."
[1:25:07] Where's he deep about that? They just
[1:25:08] didn't go, right? He said, "Carry, wait
[1:25:11] somewhere." Right? And why not wait the
[1:25:14] last place they was
[1:25:16] in, right? He didn't tell them where to
[1:25:19] go. He didn't tell them what city, what
[1:25:20] street, what address?
[1:25:23] How are you in the city of
[1:25:25] Jerusalem? So I guess and I'm pretty
[1:25:27] sure it was they went right back to
[1:25:29] where they were when they last seen.
[1:25:30] That's where I'd went. Wouldn't
[1:25:33] you? And they sat down and
[1:25:38] waited. Had they not been there, they
[1:25:40] wouldn't have got
[1:25:41] it. So brother Random and the Bible
[1:25:43] cannot be saying that that we had
[1:25:46] nothing to do with it.
[1:25:51] But that's what's taught to
[1:25:57] us, right? That's what our mind tries to
[1:26:03] translate. Where brother tell somebody
[1:26:06] come to the altar and pray and crying.
[1:26:07] Get up from there and quit
[1:26:09] crying. Quit receiving the Holy
[1:26:12] Ghost. Just go on. It'll come to you.
[1:26:19] Now you show me where he did.
[1:26:27] You see, because we're on this side of
[1:26:29] the
[1:26:30] line, we're over here in
[1:26:32] time. In time, things are taking
[1:26:39] place. Just like we were saying about
[1:26:41] God, he sits back in eternity and his
[1:26:43] fornowledge is there, but it's his
[1:26:45] fornowledge of what you will do when you
[1:26:47] get here. Mhm.
[1:26:51] His forn knowledge of Esau and Jacob was
[1:26:54] what? And Jacob was a better I mean,
[1:26:56] Esau was a better guy than
[1:27:00] Jacob. But all that God was looking at
[1:27:02] was Jacob wanted the birthight.
[1:27:05] Cuz it would tighten the baptism of the
[1:27:07] Holy
[1:27:11] Ghost. Well, go back there. Okay,
[1:27:14] Jacob, you're a shy anyway. Let's go.
[1:27:17] con your old daddy into giving it to
[1:27:23] you. You said, "Well, he
[1:27:25] did." No, his mama
[1:27:29] condimented the
[1:27:33] church. Get the
[1:27:37] point? Had Jacob not fought for the
[1:27:41] birthight and done what he'd done, he'd
[1:27:44] have never got the birthight.
[1:27:49] sister told me one time here, she said,
[1:27:50] "I want my family to be saved. I know me
[1:27:53] and my husband said, "We we've got
[1:27:54] problems, but I want, you know, a
[1:27:56] marital situation, but I want my
[1:27:57] children to be saved." I looked at her
[1:27:59] and disagreeing and
[1:28:01] just, "Oh, that's nice, right? You
[1:28:04] trying to be a sacrifice.
[1:28:09] You want to be a sacrifice for your
[1:28:10] family. You know what? That's a good
[1:28:12] point, right? You know what? What I was
[1:28:16] grinning about is cuz I knew that God
[1:28:18] didn't deal with one, right? He going to
[1:28:20] deal with getting her here, right?
[1:28:26] But that's it's all
[1:28:27] right. But
[1:28:30] listen, where did you receive eternal
[1:28:35] life? We had to receive it.
[1:28:41] See, surely we're not going to go with
[1:28:43] the bases that a lot of people say,
[1:28:44] "Well, I just born with eternal life.
[1:28:47] You're an eternal sinner. That'd be a
[1:28:49] problem, would it?" And in the message,
[1:28:52] that's what they teach. I just born of
[1:28:53] eternal life. I don't have to receive
[1:28:54] eternal life. Now, what's the Bible all
[1:29:00] about? Get what I'm saying? Then I'll
[1:29:02] come back to it this evening cuz I got
[1:29:03] about 10 minutes.
[1:29:08] You had something to do with being in
[1:29:12] the right place. They had to be in the
[1:29:14] upper
[1:29:18] room. It wasn't they were down on the
[1:29:20] street
[1:29:21] corner. They had to be there, right?
[1:29:25] They had to get there.
[1:29:30] you seeking
[1:29:34] God, you crying and praying for God to
[1:29:37] save you was exactly
[1:29:42] right. But what we don't really realize
[1:29:45] is the Bible tells us
[1:29:48] why. The Bible says the goodness of God
[1:29:52] leadth us to repentance. That's it.
[1:29:56] Brother Brandham said, and what did he
[1:29:57] say? He said God was seeking you, right?
[1:30:03] He
[1:30:05] wasn't said we wasn't seeking him. He
[1:30:08] said cuz he's not in the human mortal to
[1:30:10] seek. He said like in the garden. He
[1:30:11] said where was it in the garden? He said
[1:30:13] there it was was Adam searching for God
[1:30:15] and all God was running around the
[1:30:17] garden in the garden hollering Adam
[1:30:18] where art thou? You said a that's just a
[1:30:20] story. No it's the truth.
[1:30:25] Adam was by that time in one dimension.
[1:30:27] God was in another
[1:30:29] one. Come on. He's already
[1:30:34] fallen. But listen,
[1:30:36] church, you had something to do with
[1:30:40] this. Now, you say, "Wait a minute. Now,
[1:30:43] the Bible says salvation is of the
[1:30:44] Lord." I'll agree with you
[1:30:47] 100%. Salvation is of the Lord. But you
[1:30:51] know, after you get saved, you have
[1:30:53] something to do with your life cuz you
[1:30:54] got a choice to where you want to study.
[1:30:56] You got a choice where you want to go to
[1:30:58] church. You got a choice of what you
[1:30:59] want to do. Right?
[1:31:04] No. Bless God, this eternal life won't
[1:31:06] let me. Why did it take you so long to
[1:31:08] get here?
[1:31:11] I'm blunt. I know it.
[1:31:13] Sorry, but it's true.
[1:31:17] You sure must not have been listening to
[1:31:18] the Holy Ghost all the way down through
[1:31:20] there cuz he's been telling you where to
[1:31:21] go. Oh, now you No, I'm not building up.
[1:31:25] Tell it like it
[1:31:28] is. Brother Devil, don't build up
[1:31:30] nothing cuz they ain't nothing. You
[1:31:31] don't give me one dime extra here for
[1:31:36] these. You You can't argue that point.
[1:31:38] You know
[1:31:39] it. You out there on the internet, they
[1:31:41] can't argue that point because I don't
[1:31:43] charge nobody for nothing. I give it to
[1:31:44] them free of charge anywhere in the
[1:31:45] world they want
[1:31:46] it. You ain't having to pay for get on
[1:31:50] anything. That's right. Cuz the gospel
[1:31:52] can't be sold. Amen.
[1:31:55] It takes money to operate but it can't
[1:31:57] be sold. That's right. Amen. But listen,
[1:31:59] cuz I'm having to stop because if I
[1:32:01] don't, I'm going to go up another step.
[1:32:02] And I do, we're going to be here for two
[1:32:04] hours. All right. I'm not joking.
[1:32:10] So we on this
[1:32:15] side now are you following me? You
[1:32:17] agreed while ago. So let's if you keep
[1:32:19] following me. You agreed that God's
[1:32:22] fornowledge was of what would be when we
[1:32:24] got here. You agreed that he would
[1:32:27] predestinate according to what we would
[1:32:30] do when we got
[1:32:32] here. Now why can't you see that the
[1:32:36] choosing on our part? We're not in
[1:32:38] eternity with that word choosing cuz
[1:32:40] you're you got to drop over now. So
[1:32:42] leave don't don't get in eternity with
[1:32:44] the illustration I'm
[1:32:46] giving cuz it's not
[1:32:50] there. I'm going to go ahead and say it
[1:32:52] then you can get it this evening. God
[1:32:54] didn't look down and see your choice.
[1:32:56] That's right.
[1:32:58] Amen. If he did, you had something to do
[1:33:00] with it. That's right. And it's not
[1:33:03] grass. Amen.
[1:33:07] That's what we think. That's where our
[1:33:08] mind is
[1:33:09] locked. That we think we had something
[1:33:12] to do with it. And you say, "Well,
[1:33:13] brother Dale, you just got to explain we
[1:33:15] had something to do with it." That's
[1:33:16] where you're going to have to have a
[1:33:17] revelation to separate the two.
[1:33:21] Revelations. If you
[1:33:24] think that God looked down and saw
[1:33:30] you, then where is Jesus Christ? That's
[1:33:33] right. Amen.
[1:33:38] Well, he saw me like a
[1:33:41] choice. He knew that before the world
[1:33:44] cuz he said he knew where this seed
[1:33:46] would land up
[1:33:49] at. Now, we back up to right there cuz I
[1:33:52] can't if I go any further. Come on. If I
[1:33:55] go any further, I'll have to get into
[1:33:57] what I'm talking about and I'm not going
[1:33:58] to do it. You just hold on.
[1:34:04] Hold on a little longer. Let's sing
[1:34:07] that. Help is on the
[1:34:10] way. Come on, brother Richard. You got
[1:34:13] that song? You know it, Brother Dick?
[1:34:15] Yeah. What is it? Hold on a little
[1:34:17] longer. Is it on the way?
[1:34:21] Let's sing that. In the Bible, huh?
[1:34:23] Yeah. Yep. What do we got? You know
[1:34:26] what? What's the number? It's not in the
[1:34:29] book here. Memory. Y'all just have to
[1:34:31] sing it by memory of what what we've
[1:34:34] been doing around here. All right, go
[1:34:36] ahead. That's the chorus
[1:34:42] [Music]
[1:34:43] wind. Just hold on a little longer.
[1:35:06] our Christian
[1:35:08] life. We have to search after
[1:35:13] God. God will not override your
[1:35:16] premortal
[1:35:17] agencies. He will not make you be
[1:35:21] saved. You don't want any longer.
[1:35:27] You look down and sing your morning.
[1:35:30] [Applause]
[1:35:33] Yeah, but that's me and somebody talking
[1:35:37] [Music]
[1:35:41] about you by what you do.
[1:36:01] You know that
[1:36:04] Lord try my best to preach the
[1:36:09] gospel. I'll be like all these others
[1:36:11] and you don't need to seek out for
[1:36:15] God. Maybe you're one time priest. You
[1:36:18] don't need to carry for the Holy
[1:36:21] Ghost. The word you mean you have to
[1:36:24] carry for
[1:36:26] him
[1:36:33] wait for 2 years.
[1:36:45] That's what they stand in the other
[1:36:47] room.
[1:36:50] Somebody say, "No, it ain't
[1:37:02] coming.
[1:37:06] Heat. Heat.
[1:37:18] [Music]
