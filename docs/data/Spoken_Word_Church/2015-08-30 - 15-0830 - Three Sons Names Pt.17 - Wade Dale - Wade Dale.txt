========================================

who is if when we get to this study will do some more on the Sun man try to get it finished and then you start on the side of Davy but when we start on us under David and start doing the statute I mean we start doing down 70 weeks we may start about 10 minutes till and just have a small scripture reading before so everybody try to get in here so we can have some time recent reason being out of water run down 70 weeks to six months I would like to have about 40 minutes of ever sending to kind of get into the deck of the of the dates and the times and all that and breaking down because it does have something to do with son David he can't settle his throne until the seventy weeks of Daniel is finished so that's the restoration of Israel you can't set on that throne until Israel is restored everybody got that again 29 work your magic and my mind all the time well well when the wicked are multiplied transgression increases with garages shall see their fault that's exactly what we're going to do we're going to bible said we're going to walk out on the ashes of the wicked look at center carcass right the righteous will see the wicked back to stop no it says here look but do not just shall see their way to the wicked ok now we're not going to laugh at it or we're not going to we're not going to be haughty about it or will be part of it awaited you all right we'll we'll probably mourn for those people but but there comes a point in time to wear when when judgment said you know a natural judge probably in his mind wanders when he gets finished with the case if he gets finished pronouncing judgment as a human he has feelings did I do the right thing did we make the right judgment but remember when God said that's it that's the only judgment there is so we must be satisfy them that if they were judged transgression and create the wicked when we see them fall we're not going to be well look at us but with no we're going to look at what Jesus Christ did for us and be happy in him but we must also have the consolation that that judgment was with perfect so we don't have a thought in our minds him what I'll make no no that that Judge he's the righteous judge the Bible says and he judges right every time so so there's no we can have consolation that he didn't make a mistake see we might not have a consolation that are a real judge he may make a mistake than they have before because we're and bend but not all mighty can't make a mistake remember he judged it's before the foundation of the world this is just happening out now and he already has made ice was I was thinking I got to about three o'clock yesterday morning then go back sleep so I went sat down read few scriptures but most of the time I think oh you know some of y'all made pray or or read your Bible or read I I'm like run probably around at the house yesterday he said when I put on a sermon and I'm driving down the road he said I get sleepy so if you want to go to sleep start reading the message book it's not reading the Bible I'll guarantee you'll call clean but if you'll sit there just constantly let things run in your mind and that's what I was running in my mind you know about the Word of God I don't think we see that this word of god is so perfect because if a guy in a brother and Africa he needs a certain scripture to come to the war what God had it in the Bible in 66 books of the Bible billions of people are going to be saved by certain sections of that body your friends have what I'm saying then you're perfected by the whole bottle if I got that see you come in with one scripture maybe right you come in with one spiritual but then you're perfected by the whole Bible well all the saints that are going to be perfected are going to be perfected five what's in that bottle right there every word that's my brother Graham said every word and if I was exactly correct God saw what we need so we put it in writing perfect writing so that every individual that makes it to heaven I even foolish virgins even a cup of water is going to one identify with what what's in the Bible so all salvation all Redemption everything was written in this 66 books of the Bible for the billions of people it's going to make it to heaven that's why my brother brother Graham could say that's the Eternal Word of God now he's not going to be the Eternal Word of God written we're not going to do see like we take the Declaration of Endor in it and we put it up in the in the Hall of Justice there in wherever in Pennsylvania and that's a it's a relic it's something to look at you know so you go back to the Declaration of Independence but now remember this Bible is not going to be something that we're going to walk up to every day and go into the librarian well I wonder what that said and no it's a living body I don't think God ever and I want to get into this boom doyline we're on it I don't believe God intended to write it all now he knew he had to because in the fall I saw what brother Dale's preaching now because of the fall of all this covenants and all these all these things had to come in fact there's no covenant with a jensen 126 manning we would have come eternal there's no covenant we are God made manifest in another corner that's what we're going back to ok that's why there's no eternal covenant you don't need one there's eternal Redemption but there's not an eternal covenant there's no we don't need it coming up when we get to heaven if you do this don't do that or I know it was all set but because of the fall we need all this but God knew that and already had it wrote down remember the Bible was ready for the foundation to work putting the mighty God not only piece of paper oh I didn't have start handing out paper please sir you know he rise that yeah this is what you're supposed to say I've already wrote it down no here this is where we're going to have it that's why I was thinking too I thank God you knew what every one of these people in the world would ever think before a better that's your world and we try to limit you to all these things when he knew every thought of every person ever live from Adam talking the Millennium New Era's all then we worried if we worry about what is God going to do this for me and got you over this thing won't worry yeah it takes the fear away I don't had no fear because you know what he didn't have a Bible to read he was remember he was walking in the mind he was walking in the Word of God the Garden of Eden was created the Word of God remember Moses is one who wrote the Bible go starts my book Abraham didn't have a lot no what'd he do he heard from somebody so my talk to him okay so that's what we're getting to then not now because see we still need in Redemption you need the work the letter so you can read it comprehend it with your brain but brother grounds that we become the word as we receive the word well we're going to become a look no but I'll become a book we're going to be the rim word made manifest in a form called a bride and that's the way out of them and Eve should stay behind them word that God give them and then what needed about we don't need a Bible in heaven you need a Bible down here although this is redemption this is for redemption happen none of them is down there so this is the important part we must read the Bible we must study sure but how many times though have you set a lonesome wearing God start bringing things to you need not be the exact verbatim scripture right but the thought process of that Scripture is brought to you and God starts dealing with you when I see you didn't you didn't quote the scripture you were part of it you became part of that scripture john three sixteen only you become part of that and you don't have to go back and read it every day I don't have to go read john three sixteen everything I'm god save my soul now somebody LTX a gesture they need 36 thing okay we need a scripture to get us in and we needed the Bible to get us higher up in God right so that's when God promised he would speak to us through this word but it's not going to be a continuation the continuation is us yes going up magazine about go see these are experiences you can use a lot of David or whoever film okay listen now let's get started let's go to back to Matthew booming we're at last week well I won't go read under equal interest because what I want to do is that song man mastery that son of a ministry let me tell you something about let's get up here and right here because I'm going to get right here and show this is the trial 1964 we noticed when Jesus came and tried to rip truck look try to reveal himself tried shewe said try to reveal himself as the Son of man is he tried comes remember no one on earth it's like brother Bob brother Bob sent me a text or an email and he said I've read and he said to the Bible said and I think I'm good thanks how much 940 you know when I told you about last Sunday about Paul will not have a revelation with some man proved it in the bottom right here right here offshore team well short they are really Bob black Paul's first sermon acts 9 20 and straightway he preached Christ in the synagogue's that he is the Sun God not the son of man he had a son and God revelation and there's the first sermon in the freakin pax nine and twenty he preached Christ that he was the son of God not the Sun man alright so they're still proves more that the son of man revelation when he went up like I told you last Sunday when he went up he took that revelation women cuz what they rejected him because what Jesus come who'd he go did he came to his own and his own received him not who was it on the Jews all right when Jesus coming tried to reveal himself that Sun man don't miss this when he revealed himself and call himself constantly the son of man israel would blend right they know nothing about what son of man men but they said son of David got what blind Bartimaeus ran out a recognizing my blind Bartimaeus kept saying something he kept saying something he said thou son of David have mercy on Manny turn why because that was his son Martinez was a Jew all right David McDavid met King remember son of man son David Sun God with more this cube got what he asked for because he approached him in the name of the son of David the king he wasn't Savior but he was king remember you want to save it to the Jews at that time remember he went Seder to the Jews at that time he wasn't Savior but he was king but when the Greek woman the Sarah Phoenician woman at what was she what was she she was a gentle Gentile she wasn't a jew so she said the sheriff initial on a freak sorry the style Phoenician woman approached him in the name of the son of David remembers his son they become mushy on me he never raised his head you see how precise Jesus was Jesus was God he couldn't make everybody says he did these things wrong he never made a wrong move all right because like brother Ron Spencer said they would have been one mark against Jesus they would have brought it up in the hall pilot the Delta would have brought it up so he was he never even as much as raise his head she had no claims on him in the name of a Sunday right that's why the Bible says they a lot of people say Jesus Jesus have I not done these things in your name captain he said the park men never knew you wanted them have a personal relationship she had no claims on him in the name of the son David he wasn't son of David to that sovereign Asian woman but when she said Lord he turned around right he was the Lord's the Lord he was lord no son of David to her now why wasn't he recognized at some ma'am the son of man was a spiritual revelation of profits on a man named means probably he's talking about going to Ezekiel remember we're as evil you'll find out his ego was the property the working dog for that day and Jehovah himself called me on the son of man Jehovah called him a man the son of man the same as Jesus revealed himself as I am what was it the promise were that our being made manifest now that's the same thing here is to promise word of the Son of Man Man history being made manifest now Darla's equals town go to Jesus this time so man he was not at that time what you stopped he was the son of man because he had to reveal himself to Israel as the prophet and what did they do they rejected him all right they rejected the Soto and so then he just went over into the Son of God dispensation what Paul and then bringing it to what the jeep the jeep the Jews attacked I'm 120l run with Jews but they took it to what the Gentile all right and that was the prophecy that they should receive him in then I understand that it's ceq Son of Man promise I they should have looked at Jesus through what Ezekiel said and said you're that's not a man but they did see God had brought that revelation to them on some man who is evil they rejected it and that was the prophecy that they should receive him in in the name of the son of man of property because it was according to the word you running the 1815 the Lord your God shall raise up for profit likened unto meeting I remember that's talking the moment and when he come he identify himself in his ministry as a man not a son of God thought a man son of God the spirit so a man was the God in spirit into mini God is a spirit revealed himself as son of man what he claimed the beef and they was blinded than said but now unto the Gentiles he reveals itself now the Son of God which is the Holy Ghost hi that's down duterte when he just said Paul the church was built member Peter said jesus said Peter I'll build my church on what you just said but the revelation signed on now Arthur cry the one that created thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God he reveals himself now the Son of God which is all the go now you sit as it wasn't amazing thought let's get that wound over here Jesus it as it was in the days of Sodom when the son of man is being revealed now what's that that's the end time all right in the days of Sodom was the son that was God revealed in human flesh which was one time Cole male candidate the father no Cassidy cat that time had no father mother no beginning of days ending of life everybody was he remains the same Jesus had father mother nature I'm like the flesh right but this man had me the father the mother he appeared to Abraham in the form of a son of man right hello me I'm Jehovah church now has served the term through the church age in the baptism of the Holy go so I'm good right there by okay with that Sun God that's the Sun God revelation it's what john three sixteen regards all over the world these sins only begotten son it's going to believe the name shall have eternal life only know the church now I serve the term through the church age in the baptism of the Holy note but jesus said here lame alki for and rest of these creatures real to you see that in the last days just before the coming the world setting will be like the Sodom and the Son of Man will reveal himself as the Son of Man like he did in the days of Sodom blind prosecutor can't you see that nothing else garden Princeton thorn in words of truth it's the sub God impersonated in his church that son of man everybody got them now you think well that's a bad choice of words but we look at the impersonation is is you know I try to fix myself up to look like Danny and deny going person ate him no it's the person it's the Son of God in person in his church as the son of man now that's us look at the real good son a man like daughter father gone hold on since the same guy three different attributes of the same God now this is the son of David Son of Man reveals the Prophet son updated the king now the Son of God to the church agent as God is a man God is a spirit and the spirit son is the Holy Ghost everybody got that which is revealing the church agent honestly honestly in the church ages what happens is you get a revelation that Jesus Christ sure he's the son of man but you get a revelation that what inside of him was going to save you then I got that and who was inside of the Son of Man the Son of God right the Sun God was inside the Son of Man revealing himself so down to the church ages they believed on the Lord Jesus Christ and they would say all right they didn't really like heart let her say the pub drink the beer smoke product that wasn't God that wasn't the fullness of god and what the fullness of god that was that was man not a man man all right but he had a son of God inside up in a limited form God wet limited the word was limited to be happy if I understand them but in the end time that's when I'm brother round had to come that's why there had to be a prophetic tropic brother branham sure the Holy note but through brother round had to bring us the revelation that hey you are not just a part of them tell me you're part of God but that son of man is going to make your flesh going to make your flesh like this letter nevermind I'll says you will have a body like and hit 40 place a man because well that's the change the Sun God don't take a body saying the soul man takes a body chain that's one of the people with the Son of God revelation or gain have died down from Paul all the way down so they did have a sudden revelation alright that's from here to here that's the statue of a perfect man of which is only spirit that is the working of a powerful church see all the people in the message I something somebody I'm trying Bob home last Wednesday night everybody thinks because you're in the message goes r in this church age that we're right here automatic and it worked out we were just adopted son the gun no Jesus was adopted when he got here there's a man all right brother round one adopted right when he got here I mean with the baby he was 50 something you're no 53 years old he lived a long time and I Malaysia he saw some of the most powerful manifestations of God that the world had ever seen he saw his self because he lived through that but yeah as a Malachai for the angel coating has not been made I bet you that floor that man humanly probably went what else is left no thanks a lot left don't worry about it so when they took him out their own sunset mountain and God adopted him in front of the world he came back out here and then he started preaching the shrine in the Son of Man headstone because he Jesus was all this standing here this was his feet his loins its neck and his head all right they cut his head off just figuratively they cut him off brother Brown said that said they what they cut him off called the son of man's got to be risen again from the dead which meant they killed him they killed him they killed his attack right they killed his effect he didn't have a lot of effect here when he was hearing person you know but they killed his attack they killed the son of man you can't kill something on they killed son man but the Sun man is what to the body change joys and glory now this is his body but this has got to come back to unite to what to make it fully Jesus Christ here so I do believe that the brownie Jesus Christ is the son revelation of the Son of Man like it should have been in Jesus remember right now this is the way it should be so it looks bad I'll lift you my friend only a few are going to come to that son of man revelation to the Jews he was the son of God to the Greeks he was lured to us he's lured to the Gentiles and now in the last days he would return back again as son of man because Malachi promises that there would be a profit rise up in the last day that will return the hearts of the people back to away from them organizations back to the original word the faith of the Father see original Pentecost alright comes remember brother grounds hadn't met the messenger those two things what restore back to hear time to loose ends together leuchars message was not the fullness subscribe nobody got that same man hey man you what the Foley's cuz people know you're doing things that he shook that Jesus wasn't done right right done Wesley same thing they were some things over here that he was doing the Jews wouldn't do alright but now you come back you see brother branham you see him come and you see him praying the word and you see him doing the things that Jesus did so close to where they thought he was God manifested god I say he was good I say you are if you manifest God but you're not God himself in one person you're a manifestation of God all right all the bride of Jesus Christ is the manifestation of God doesn't matter if you know these more i'm in the grave now than then they will you know then you're alive were the only ones left we're it see how you going to reveal the mysteries see what Luke are left off see what Leslie left off see what Hancock left off and reveal the secret of the heart to make it the same guy to every age which is nothing but God's Word being made manifest back to the son of man again we don't look for nail scars we look for the word made manifest so what's he saying we're not working we're not looking for the Corporal body of Jesus to walk in with the now scarf not till the millennium or not what we meet him in the air and go to the lens up right right so the Son of Man revelation bottom line is if the son of man had been revealed brought them the seals and you say well brother Brad was the first one to preach them knowing what they were in Matthew ankle brother Brennan Santa salvisa Jesus preached six seals in Matthew 24 and he was the seventh he was the revelation of those sealed so Brett Brown didn't come and preach a new model he took every scripture that was in the Bible and showed us what he meant Wesley let's see what and of course back door wanna be able to see that was brother branham know I was different than any cuisine could tell he brought the secrets of their heart so that was an addition watch what he's saying back to son of man again we don't look from house guards we look for the word made manifest to notice gun promise these things now and he does he just as he said I could say more but we'll leave the subject it's getting late so it's getting late for us to but the Son of Man revelation the sundog revelations in the seven churches the Son of Man revelation was the opening of the Seventh Seal from nineteen sixty-three in march through nineteen sixty-five at brother Brown's death and its continued on because he brought he opened them we've gotta look in them right because remember John didn't take the book from the angel that was revelation 10-7 and tell you from the name he took it from the mighty anger so join with the top of who the bride so we must take it you say what are you doing away from around no in fact 10-7 profit if that I angel had become what he do did he make himself Christ no he pointed us to cry so John takes the book from the mighty angel brother I've said that mighty angel was crying so John takes the boat from the angel what we're supposed to be like the Bible instance my late brother round over the steel form Jesus Christ blue and brown over the seal but did that do anybody any good that cause rapper yet dead cops were after 1963 he actually said not getting this it's not for you when you say live a good what was he saying live a good simple son of God revelation Christian life that's what he will say you've been born again you've been baptized into the body your your full Christians just live that full Christian life because the people that is supposed to come to is somebody's been born yet double y'all work with so many work now it's three years old 1963 so that generation coming brother is what he was saying he said this generation is not getting and he said but now that generation coming they're going to give it a revelation not only the revelation the son of god they're gonna get revelations in a man see watch van right next same wave right now does everybody get what we're looking at with a snowman it was son of God through seven turkey the Son of Man revelation was not the flesh of God coming back we're not going to peace nothing touch your shirt we're gonna meet him in the air the flesh of god it's my brother Graham said no nails cars no you guys wasted oil in the hand blood all that stuff people was impersonating he said no it's the Son of Man being revealed through the bride of Jesus Christ I don't see why people don't understand that because let's before we go let's read a lot of people don't read revelations right let's go to Revelation till I had a preacher he was he was preaching a sermon and and I didn't say anything I did but he was saying John took the book from brother ground and I just let him go on in about two weeks later he told me bad he said I was wrong so CLE incorrect to say I let him cry because I didn't want to jump on him correct him out that would have been just that would have not been good so I just went God correctly and got a crack somebody this good that's right I mean somebody's got it on his heart he will first five in the angel which I saw stand upon seeing upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven the who is that Christ alright and swear by him that liveth for ever and ever that work humans not supposed to swear to who of them dead he's already talking about what he swore by himself because he liveth for ever never could create heaven a hoodie talking about God and the things that they're in the earth thinks they're in and seeing other things that they're in that there should be time no longer know who was this mighty angel had to be Christ the crossing the Creator all right but 47 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be fenced as he has declared to his servants the prophets and a voice which I heard from heaven span done to me against they go and take the little book which is open in the hand the angel you know all this brother around no what's he identified what angle it was we expanded upon the sea upon the earth so who do you take the book from he took the book from Christ we're supposed to take the book from Christ brother renamon is to what the conduit that brings the revelation truly truly truly nobody got that revelation okay until the end time and I went unto the angel said unto him give me the little book and he said to me take it here she'll make up any better yummy in the mount sweet honey I took the book out of the Angels hand the worst books to take the book out of the mighty angel Christ is a mighty angel had to eat it up you didn't leave a page out he didn't leave the for work he didn't leave with concordance he'd eat the whole thing right cuz some of the people take it from the angle man they eat it all but about a two sold doctrine or 700 doctor that's not in that book and it was in my mouth sweet as honey obviously when we come to churches all sweet honey and as soon as i eat it my belly was better what he had to go out living he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many people the nation come to team so what's he doing the voice of the bridegroom was in the bride and he said unto me who's me John the joint ops the bride so he set it to the pride that I must promise idea where the one who's taking the message to the people i don't understand what people have this have this real fuzzy feeling about us having the revelation right big brother brown know most people are preaching that brother branham had a revelation that's going to get you putting the grave you got our room John had to have a revelation when he took that book he took that book any 80 so it became part of John he disappeared and it is disappearing in the bride now because it's going to be a secret catching away amana so next week we will review just a few minutes and then we'll talk about sunbathing then we'll begin in the nineteen seventy weeks right
