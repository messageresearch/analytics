[7:18] amen so in luke chapter 24
[7:22] it says i'm kind of going to start uh
[7:24] down at verse 27
[7:26] and if you go back and read the whole
[7:27] chapter this is talking about um all of
[7:29] these
[7:30] things happened on the day of the
[7:31] resurrection um
[7:33] and it says and and this is where um the
[7:35] the two cleopas and his friend were
[7:37] walking on the road to emmaus
[7:39] and and jesus kind of you know popped
[7:42] out of the bushes or began to
[7:44] come along along with them began to walk
[7:46] along with them
[7:47] and they didn't they didn't know who he
[7:49] was and it says and beginning at moses
[7:51] and all the prophets he expounded unto
[7:53] them and all the scriptures the things
[7:55] concerning himself and they drew nigh
[7:58] under the village whether they went and
[8:01] he made as though he would have gone
[8:02] further
[8:04] but they constrained him saying abide
[8:06] with us for it is toward evening and the
[8:08] day is far spent
[8:10] and he went into terry with him and it
[8:12] came to pass as he sat at meat with him
[8:14] he took bread and blessed it and break
[8:16] and gave to them
[8:17] and their eyes were opened and they knew
[8:20] him and he vanished out of their sight
[8:22] and they said one to another did not our
[8:25] heart burn within us while he talked
[8:26] with us by the way and while he opened
[8:28] us the scriptures
[8:30] you may be seated the lord had his
[8:31] blessing to the reading of your work
[8:35] now uh just kind of y'all y'all know how
[8:39] i like to do
[8:40] is just kind of taking and break down uh
[8:43] a sermon that brother branham preached
[8:44] and the message this afternoon to break
[8:47] down is the greatest news flash in
[8:50] history
[8:51] and um you know i
[8:55] kind of realized one day that it's it's
[8:57] better to just say
[8:59] say what brother branham said and and uh
[9:01] you know there's a lot of things maybe
[9:03] we could add into sermons a lot of times
[9:04] and everything but if you just preach
[9:06] the word there's a power in the word
[9:08] that the uh and i believe that comes
[9:11] from
[9:11] kind of dying out to yourself when you
[9:13] realize that
[9:14] that it doesn't matter so much maybe our
[9:16] opinions and the way things
[9:18] we think we should things should go and
[9:21] and whatnot so i just want to
[9:22] just kind of want to take what brother
[9:24] branham said and just kind of lay it out
[9:25] there and i believe
[9:27] that it will have an effect now brother
[9:29] brown said that
[9:30] that these two men that they began to
[9:32] walk down and the road along the road
[9:34] they were looking around and they uh
[9:36] he said that you know after jesus died
[9:38] and they they
[9:39] uh and and rose rose again they
[9:42] everybody was kind of an expectation for
[9:44] something to happen
[9:45] they were they were looking maybe
[9:47] looking expecting to meet
[9:48] jesus and he and you know you begin to
[9:51] kind of
[9:51] kind of meditate on that expecting
[9:53] coming and expecting
[9:55] everywhere they went people were one
[9:57] wandering and expecting for something to
[9:59] happen i
[10:00] i wonder if that's how we should be when
[10:02] we come into the house of the lord when
[10:03] we go to special services or whatever we
[10:06] sometimes we kind of lose our
[10:07] expectation and we kind of begin to go
[10:09] through the motions but not these
[10:11] they were expecting to meet jesus you
[10:14] know the bible says that he'll appear to
[10:15] those that look for him if you're
[10:17] looking for him
[10:18] then he's going to appear for you in
[10:19] other words if you're just meditating
[10:21] constantly thinking about it and
[10:23] thinking about his word and
[10:24] i believe that's the right way to
[10:26] approach the bible and the scriptures to
[10:28] actually
[10:28] you know go through and just highlight
[10:31] things and just sit there and think
[10:32] about it and meditate on it and before
[10:34] long god will begin to open up
[10:36] things to you he'll begin to reveal to
[10:38] you things that maybe before you
[10:40] stumbled over and tripped over and
[10:42] and wondered it now so they were under
[10:44] that expectation and brother brown said
[10:46] though
[10:46] think about those 40 days that jesus was
[10:49] on earth appearing for 40 days 40 days
[10:51] and all during that time people you know
[10:53] constantly looking
[10:54] is he going to appear here is he going
[10:56] to appear here and and he would show up
[10:58] among
[10:59] 500 and show up among a few disciples
[11:01] and thomas miss and then show up with
[11:03] thomas there and
[11:04] show up here and there show up to peter
[11:05] and and just constantly showing up and i
[11:08] believe that
[11:09] i believe see this message that brother
[11:10] man preached i believe was to open our
[11:12] eyes to the fact that he is here
[11:15] if we'll just if we'll just come
[11:16] expecting that he is here he's not
[11:19] he's not a god of yesterday he's not
[11:21] somebody that's still in the grave but
[11:23] he is actually
[11:24] still alive among us brother abraham
[11:27] said how that every being in the road
[11:29] you might meet with him face to face the
[11:31] resurrected lord jesus
[11:33] at every turn think about that that
[11:35] every turn art say it like this at every
[11:37] church service
[11:38] every sunday morning every sunday
[11:40] evening every wednesday night the
[11:42] every time you turn a corner there might
[11:44] there you might run into the lord jesus
[11:46] not
[11:47] not just some story from ages gone by
[11:49] but the resurrected lord jesus revealing
[11:52] himself in flesh again
[11:54] where you can actually see him so i want
[11:56] to say i want to clarity tonight maybe
[11:58] just come expecting to see and come
[12:01] expecting to see you
[12:02] now come expect it always when you're
[12:04] driving in your car when you're
[12:06] listening to a tape
[12:07] expect to meet him there because it's
[12:09] not just in church when you can really
[12:11] enter into worship but it's when you're
[12:13] in the shower when you're in
[12:14] alone in the car with god when you're
[12:17] sitting under the apple tree or when
[12:18] you're doing your work
[12:19] is when god can come by and speak to you
[12:23] now brother ram said on the road to
[12:24] emmaus one day he said two men were
[12:27] walking along and he said a man stepped
[12:29] out just an
[12:29] ordinary man not dressed any different
[12:32] in priestly robes he was a man just
[12:34] ordinary clothes on there a man that
[12:36] walked he said and then
[12:38] they walked out begin to talk to them
[12:40] said
[12:41] why are you weary now and that's how so
[12:43] many times
[12:44] we'll come across god in our life maybe
[12:46] just somebody come along just speaking
[12:48] to us
[12:50] you see many times god when he appears
[12:52] it's veiled behind badger skins that
[12:54] many times we don't realize
[12:56] that it's actually god talking to you a
[12:58] man behind the pulpit or your pastor
[13:00] clothed in badger skins or of somebody
[13:03] in your family that's speaking the word
[13:05] of god to you
[13:06] but if we'll just realize that that's
[13:08] god appearing to us
[13:09] god given us something to take this
[13:11] journey by something to
[13:13] to conquer we have something to overcome
[13:15] and they said why
[13:16] you're a stranger said jesus of nazareth
[13:19] who he knew to be a prophet of god
[13:21] and expected him to be the king of
[13:23] israel and they killed him
[13:26] and he's dead and he's buried all this
[13:29] trouble has set in and everything
[13:31] looking at circumstances wondering
[13:33] wondering like maybe so many in the
[13:35] message today when pastors are leaving
[13:37] the message and
[13:38] things are things are going right what's
[13:40] what's going on i wonder if he's still
[13:42] alive
[13:43] or if if these are just stories that we
[13:45] heard i wonder if he's still alive but
[13:48] he is still alive
[13:49] and he will manifest himself i believe
[13:52] you know one thing i kind of got to
[13:54] thinking about is you know that the kids
[13:56] have been going
[13:57] this summer as we kind of get out of
[13:58] this pandemic stuff and they started
[14:00] going back to camps and i'm the one at
[14:02] home that kind of sits up and waits for
[14:04] them to get back and when they get back
[14:06] at night you know i'm sitting there and
[14:07] i
[14:08] i want to hear the things that are done
[14:10] i want to hear these stories and they
[14:12] come back
[14:12] and they're not telling about just just
[14:14] kind of going to like maybe you know
[14:16] just
[14:17] like regular we'll say regular church
[14:19] but they're coming back telling about
[14:21] how
[14:22] that they met jesus how that they saw
[14:25] god move how that they had an experience
[14:27] you see that'll excite anybody to know
[14:29] that
[14:30] he's not just a god of history or
[14:32] something that's dead still in the grave
[14:34] but he is alive
[14:36] and that brother brandon said he talked
[14:38] with him all day and they never
[14:40] recognized him he made like he would go
[14:43] on by and they constrained him and kept
[14:45] constraining until finally
[14:47] he went in with him and now sometimes
[14:49] you sometimes you gotta
[14:51] you gotta constrain him a little bit you
[14:53] gotta get a little bit desperate
[14:55] you gotta do like like jacob did and
[14:57] wrestle wrestle with the angel you gotta
[14:59] you gotta want something he said all day
[15:02] all day
[15:03] not knowing who he was now now you think
[15:06] about
[15:07] maybe maybe think about your own life
[15:10] maybe you've been going
[15:10] coming to church your whole life maybe
[15:12] you've been coming to church because
[15:14] your mama and your daddy that's what
[15:15] they did and you come to church because
[15:17] you're
[15:17] you're the people that you're associated
[15:19] with come to church but
[15:20] do you know that jesus christ is alive
[15:23] or are you still looking at it wondering
[15:25] wondering if he's alive
[15:27] after talking with him all day hear it
[15:29] and preach for three years
[15:31] hearing and preach after his
[15:33] resurrection brother brahm said and did
[15:35] not
[15:36] recognize him until he did something
[15:39] just like he did before his crucifixion
[15:42] you see there they were on that road to
[15:43] emmaus and he took them
[15:45] they took him they constrained him in
[15:47] into the door behind the in
[15:49] in the little building there and shut
[15:51] the door and there he did something to
[15:53] prove
[15:54] that he was alive something that he had
[15:56] done before the
[15:57] resurrection and if you read on down in
[15:58] that chapter in the in the book of bikes
[16:00] it talks about something related
[16:02] to the breaking of the bread he broke
[16:04] the bread in the same way that he did
[16:06] before his resurrection
[16:08] now brother brown said it sometimes
[16:10] sometimes it takes the supernatural
[16:13] to make us understand it takes the
[16:16] supernatural to make us
[16:17] understand he said isn't it a strange
[16:19] thing that it takes something on the
[16:21] side of
[16:22] supernatural to make us understand that
[16:25] it's him
[16:26] now maybe this is maybe a little simple
[16:28] message tonight but i just want to
[16:29] declare that
[16:30] this is a supernatural gospel this is
[16:33] not we're not just learning about things
[16:35] like in a reading room and then just
[16:36] kind of
[16:38] sharing with people how much we know but
[16:39] there is actually a living reality to
[16:42] this
[16:42] a supernatural a supernatural god
[16:45] manifesting himself in supernatural ways
[16:48] to a supernatural bride
[16:52] brother brown said there were many who
[16:53] taught hey and now listen this is a
[16:56] this is a quote that stumbles a lot of
[16:57] people all i had quotes that kind of
[16:59] trip people up he said that teaching
[17:03] teaching itself won't do it teaching
[17:06] itself won't do it that sometimes you
[17:08] need
[17:08] you need the supernatural now now let's
[17:11] let's
[17:11] massage that a little bit let's dive
[17:13] into that to see
[17:15] what he might mean when he says that
[17:16] teaching itself
[17:18] won't do that now come on now that you
[17:20] know that stutter trips people up a
[17:21] little bit
[17:22] you begin to wonder now wait a second
[17:24] does he mean that
[17:25] we that we don't need teachers in the
[17:28] faithful ministry that can't be what he
[17:29] means
[17:30] he doesn't mean we don't need teachers
[17:32] in the five full ministry
[17:33] but you see brother branham said there
[17:35] were many who were taught
[17:37] that there was going to be a messiah
[17:39] there were many who were taught that
[17:41] there was going to be a messiah one day
[17:42] but then one day
[17:44] the messiah actually showed up and when
[17:47] the messiah showed up and manifested the
[17:49] supernatural then
[17:51] then it actually makes it real see you
[17:53] can hear about it
[17:54] but when the messiah shows up when he
[17:56] shows up in your life and actually
[17:59] when you when something actually
[18:00] connects when the wires connect
[18:03] and the air the spirit of the living god
[18:05] comes and quickens the word
[18:06] then that takes all the doubt that's
[18:08] what takes all the doubt away
[18:10] listen you can argue over what you've
[18:12] been taught but you can't argue over
[18:14] what's been revealed you can't argue
[18:16] over what's been
[18:17] supernaturally made manifest you see how
[18:20] sometimes
[18:21] sometimes it takes the supernatural to
[18:24] actually make it something that's
[18:25] that's real to you
[18:28] you see the pharisees the pharisees kept
[18:31] all their rules and everything they
[18:32] thought that it was just
[18:33] rules and they thought well we okay now
[18:35] we got a good handle on what the sabbath
[18:37] is and
[18:38] we we wash our pots and our pans and we
[18:41] say how far we make rules for how far
[18:43] you can carry sticks
[18:44] but then jesus came along and he baffled
[18:47] him because
[18:48] he healed somebody on the sabbath he
[18:50] went down to the pool of bethesda and
[18:51] said
[18:52] pick up your cot on the sabbath day and
[18:54] it baffled them why because there was
[18:56] the interpretation of the scripture
[18:58] there was the supernatural made manifest
[19:01] and all of their teaching that they had
[19:03] heard
[19:03] what it manifested there in their sight
[19:07] all
[19:08] what their teaching could not make real
[19:11] you see
[19:13] what about how all of these
[19:14] denominational systems have taught
[19:16] matthew 28 19 and taught what it was and
[19:19] laid down the teaching
[19:21] but then one day a prophet came with a
[19:23] supernatural
[19:24] revelation a supernatural understanding
[19:26] of what that was and
[19:28] shared with us tying it back to what
[19:30] peter preached
[19:31] that the true revelation of matthew 28
[19:33] 19 is acts 2 38
[19:35] that the name of the father son and holy
[19:37] ghost is jesus christ
[19:39] because the father's got a name and a
[19:41] son has a name and the holy ghost has a
[19:43] name
[19:44] and that name of those offices is jesus
[19:47] christ
[19:48] there's one god that's being manifested
[19:50] in those three
[19:51] offices that's one god in the office of
[19:53] the holy ghost
[19:54] living and dwelling in you and and that
[19:57] supernatural understanding when it's
[19:58] revealed to you you can't argue with it
[20:04] john chapter 6 verse 53 when jesus said
[20:06] unto them verily verily i say unto you
[20:08] and i see we can teach this
[20:10] except ye eat the flesh of the son of
[20:12] man and drink his blood you have no life
[20:14] in you
[20:15] you can teach that except you eat his
[20:17] flesh and get all confused like the
[20:18] catholics do they believe that when
[20:20] they're taking the communion
[20:21] and the wafer that they're actually
[20:23] eating the body of jesus christ
[20:26] but you see a supernatural revelation a
[20:28] supernatural when the supernatural comes
[20:31] it will give the true interpretation of
[20:33] that you see why we've got
[20:35] we've got it takes the supernatural it
[20:38] takes the supernatural to give you that
[20:40] substance
[20:41] that you cannot be shaken from it takes
[20:43] more than teaching teaching itself won't
[20:46] do it
[20:46] teaching lays that foundation it gives
[20:48] you something and then but then it's got
[20:50] to be quickened by the word
[20:53] it was the woman at the well that all
[20:55] her life she had heard that t her father
[20:57] or mother or whoever it was had taught
[20:58] her about
[20:59] one day there's coming a messiah but
[21:01] then she met a man that said
[21:03] that told her about all of her husbands
[21:05] and all the things that were wrong in
[21:06] her life and all the sin in her life
[21:08] and she ran into the city saying come
[21:10] see a man
[21:11] come see the supernatural that has been
[21:14] witnessed to me i've been
[21:16] in touch with the supernatural something
[21:18] that was beyond
[21:19] all of the teaching that i've heard
[21:21] peter and andrew that have been taught
[21:23] by by their father and they've been
[21:25] taught that one day the messiah is
[21:27] coming and then one day they met a man
[21:29] that said
[21:30] cast your ned on the other side of the
[21:31] boat and there they were witness to the
[21:33] supernatural
[21:34] that rose that teaching the life and
[21:37] there in front of them was what they had
[21:38] been taught
[21:39] there in front of them was god
[21:41] manifested in flesh
[21:43] and moses that had been taught by his
[21:45] mama taught that one day you're going to
[21:47] be a deliverer one day you are you're
[21:49] going to be raised up for this purpose
[21:51] and he tried to do it on his own he
[21:53] tried to do it on top of that teaching
[21:55] that he had
[21:56] but the teaching wasn't enough one day
[21:58] he met the pillar of fire
[22:00] and that put that teaching into action
[22:02] down into
[22:03] down he went into egypt and he said let
[22:06] my people go do you realize that's
[22:08] that's the supernatural when he said let
[22:10] my people go that's something that all
[22:12] the teaching couldn't give him
[22:13] something personal brother brother said
[22:17] hey talking about peter he said that man
[22:19] had been taught by his father that when
[22:20] messiah cometh
[22:22] he'll be a prophet and simon was a
[22:24] fisherman but one day
[22:26] when he walked in the presence of jesus
[22:28] christ and he said your name is simon
[22:30] and you are the son of jonas and i'll
[22:33] call you peter from now on
[22:35] he knowed that was the messiah he was a
[22:38] changed man from that day on
[22:40] you gotta get in touch with the
[22:42] supernatural when you get in touch with
[22:44] a supernatural
[22:45] natural it will change your life it will
[22:47] change your life from a cold dead former
[22:49] christian
[22:50] it'll make you know how to worship in
[22:52] order to serve god and
[22:53] live for god it'll change your soul and
[22:55] his attributes are made manifest in you
[23:00] now listen listen think about this now
[23:02] philip
[23:03] in in acts chapter eight he went down to
[23:05] the samaritans now listen how brother
[23:07] but i'm late
[23:08] he he lays this this out that philip
[23:11] taught the samaritans he taught them and
[23:14] then
[23:14] peter came behind to unlock the door
[23:18] now in acts chapter 8 verse 5 to 6 it
[23:20] says then philip went down to the city
[23:22] of samaria and preached christ unto them
[23:25] and the people with one accord gave heed
[23:27] under those things which philip spake
[23:29] hearing and seeing the miracles which he
[23:31] did you see they believed what philip
[23:33] said
[23:33] they believed what was taught to them
[23:35] they went and were baptized they
[23:37] listened to what he said they were
[23:38] baptized but yet they didn't receive the
[23:40] holy ghost in other words they hadn't
[23:42] yet
[23:42] got in contact with the supernatural the
[23:45] wires hadn't connected yet
[23:46] even though they were taught you see it
[23:49] takes more
[23:50] than just being taught it takes the
[23:51] supernatural and you see in acts chapter
[23:54] 8 verse 14 to 17 it says now when the
[23:56] apostles which were at jerusalem
[23:58] heard that samaria had received the word
[24:00] of god
[24:01] they had received the word of god they
[24:03] had received the teaching
[24:05] they sent unto them peter and john who
[24:07] when they were come down
[24:08] prayed for them that they might receive
[24:10] the holy ghost for
[24:12] yet he was fallen upon none of them only
[24:14] they were baptized in the name of the
[24:15] lord jesus
[24:17] then lay their hands on them and they
[24:19] receive the holy ghost
[24:22] now brother branham said that peter
[24:24] peter you know what peter did he
[24:26] actually unlock the door
[24:28] to the supernatural to the three groups
[24:30] of people that came off that ark
[24:32] ham sham and japeath he unlocked the
[24:34] holy ghost
[24:35] to the people to the to the jews at
[24:37] pentecost he unlocked
[24:39] the holy ghost to the to the house of
[24:41] cornelius to the gentiles
[24:42] at the house of cornelius and he
[24:44] unlocked there to the samaritans when he
[24:47] came down to the people that had been
[24:48] taught the word
[24:49] and what what is unlocked mean it's
[24:51] preaching the gospel
[24:53] to unlock in a way that you can un-open
[24:56] up your door
[24:57] to realize that it's there for you to
[24:59] realize that god is alive
[25:01] actually present in the building that
[25:03] he's there ready for you if you'll just
[25:05] open up your heart and believe it
[25:07] that it's available for you if you want
[25:09] it if stare
[25:10] now the teaching was there the teaching
[25:12] had already been laid out
[25:13] and he was preaching something that made
[25:15] it accessible to them
[25:16] preaching it in a way that they knew
[25:18] that it was there and it unlocked
[25:20] open the door he gave them the key did
[25:23] jesus say that
[25:24] i give you the keys peter peter had the
[25:26] keys
[25:27] he had the revelation of jesus christ to
[25:30] open up the door
[25:31] to the supernatural to them and you see
[25:33] even though they had heard the teaching
[25:36] even though they had heard phillip go
[25:38] down there they needed the supernatural
[25:43] sometimes it takes somebody with the key
[25:46] to unlock the supernatural
[25:48] now you know brother branham and the
[25:50] oneness of unity he was laying out how
[25:51] that was actually what billy
[25:53] billy graham's problem was his problem
[25:55] was that he would go into a place
[25:57] and he would preach repentance and the
[25:59] people would believe and they would say
[26:01] yes i need to repent but yet they would
[26:03] empty out in other words they would get
[26:05] emptied out
[26:06] but yet there wasn't something to fill
[26:08] them up they needed somebody with the
[26:10] key to open up the door that they could
[26:11] get
[26:12] filled up you see it wasn't enough just
[26:14] for them to hear billy graham say that
[26:16] you need to repent and everything and
[26:17] they
[26:17] they would now let's let's listen to the
[26:19] way brother brown said he said but today
[26:21] is billy graham my beloved brother
[26:23] as he's having the people to dump
[26:25] themselves out with sin
[26:27] he hasn't got the message of filling up
[26:30] again
[26:31] he hasn't got the message of filling up
[26:33] again that's what's the matter
[26:35] you are dumped out but let me humbly
[26:37] speak to you as your brother now listen
[26:38] to that
[26:39] let me humbly speak to you as your
[26:42] brother
[26:43] why because he had a message of feeling
[26:45] filling up
[26:46] he had a message that could feel you do
[26:48] you realize that actually what billy
[26:50] graham did put them in a worse situation
[26:53] because now they were emptied out and
[26:55] they got filled up again with a
[26:56] religious spirit
[26:57] instead of getting filled up with the
[26:58] holy ghost and now they wouldn't go set
[27:00] in their churches and everything and
[27:01] they just
[27:02] ended up being just horri just a
[27:04] horrible situation
[27:05] if you don't get the good man of the
[27:07] house at the door to keep the devil out
[27:09] then
[27:09] then the devil's going to come in and
[27:10] make himself right at home and make you
[27:13] a good religious person sitting in a
[27:14] church
[27:15] ain't filled up with the holy ghost just
[27:17] criticizing everybody else prisoners
[27:18] criticizing the preacher
[27:20] when he's preaching not only those
[27:21] criticizing somebody when they're
[27:22] preaching repentance
[27:24] because all you all you end up with
[27:25] again is a good intellectual person
[27:27] sitting in a church that's been emptied
[27:29] out but ain't been filled up again
[27:32] you see what we need is to be filled up
[27:34] with the holy ghost
[27:36] fill up so that we can recognize what
[27:38] god is doing in this day
[27:39] fill up so that we've got power to
[27:41] overcome
[27:44] now what is the supernatural the
[27:46] supernatural
[27:47] the dictionary says of a manifestation
[27:50] or event attributed
[27:51] attributed to some force beyond
[27:54] scientific understanding
[27:56] or the laws of nature in other words in
[27:58] other words it's it's something that you
[28:00] can't understand
[28:01] you can't understand when like like the
[28:03] the story i was sharing with some of the
[28:04] brothers how
[28:05] i want a brother that we know in the
[28:07] message was preaching behind the pulpit
[28:09] and he stepped away for a little bit and
[28:11] and and one of the ministers said i saw
[28:13] i saw your ipad go flipping through
[28:15] it was flipping through and it opened up
[28:17] the table app and it clicked on the
[28:18] sermon and while he was preaching the
[28:20] sermon began to play
[28:21] wow that's beyond scientific
[28:23] understanding that's actually the
[28:24] supernatural at work
[28:26] the supernatural at work is when you're
[28:28] in a church and somebody looks up and
[28:29] says i saw
[28:30] an angel standing over there on the side
[28:32] the supernatural when the preaching of
[28:33] the god
[28:34] of the word is going forth and somebody
[28:36] after the service says i felt a spirit
[28:39] leave me
[28:39] and now i've got liberty that's the
[28:42] super supernatural you can't explain it
[28:44] because
[28:45] something supernatural is happening it's
[28:47] supernatural when you look at a real
[28:49] christian person and they're actually
[28:51] walking and demonstrating patience
[28:53] a temperance when a car pulls out in
[28:55] front of them they don't fly over the
[28:57] animals
[28:57] something's got a hold of them that you
[28:59] can't explain by scientific reasoning of
[29:01] the laws of nature
[29:03] something beyond the realms of the
[29:04] natural man the natural light
[29:06] something's got a hold of them from
[29:08] another world that's why brother brown
[29:10] preached that sermon look into the
[29:11] unseen because we're not looking to
[29:13] what the natural eye can see we're
[29:15] looking beyond we're looking to by faith
[29:17] to something that the natural eye cannot
[29:19] see into the supernatural realm
[29:25] listen that's why that's what we've got
[29:27] pictures of the pillar of fire on our
[29:28] walls
[29:29] because we're believing we're following
[29:31] a supernatural message
[29:32] we're actually you know everybody says
[29:34] well the message message people follow a
[29:36] man we're the only we're actually the
[29:38] only people that don't follow a man
[29:39] everybody else is following their
[29:41] presbyters and their denominational
[29:43] system and whatever the pope says
[29:44] but we're the only ones that actually
[29:46] follow the leading of the spirit and
[29:47] don't put a period behind what we
[29:49] believe
[29:49] because what god shows us today he'll
[29:51] he'll open it up
[29:53] let me tell you when i when i read and i
[29:55] study these messages and then go preach
[29:56] them again in another church or
[29:58] something
[29:58] every time i read it more and more opens
[30:01] up why because we're not bound by what
[30:03] some man says some presbyter or
[30:05] something
[30:05] but the holy ghost our joshua is leading
[30:08] us into the promised land
[30:09] he's taken us to where we need to go
[30:12] listen the pillar of fire proving that
[30:14] the message is true
[30:15] you know i'm i'm not going to call names
[30:17] here but one of the kids here
[30:19] went to was battling out whether the
[30:21] message was true
[30:22] and they went down to one of the
[30:24] louisiana camp and they had the prayer
[30:25] line down there
[30:26] and and battling out whether or not this
[30:28] message was true they came out and
[30:30] looked back at the prayer line and there
[30:32] over the prayer line
[30:33] was the pillar of fire vindicating and
[30:36] proving
[30:36] that this message is true and they
[30:38] swooped over the building and listen
[30:40] now maybe their life wasn't changed then
[30:42] maybe it took a while for something
[30:44] something to actually take a hold but
[30:45] listen we are accompanied by the
[30:47] we're being led by something that's
[30:49] supernatural we're not here just to
[30:51] learn about something but there's
[30:52] actually a god that's in our midst
[30:54] proving his word it's the spirit of god
[30:57] that can move through a bill and get
[30:59] something
[30:59] something that can deliver somebody from
[31:01] a suicidal thought or wanting to cut
[31:03] themselves or
[31:04] slice up their body or destroy
[31:06] themselves something
[31:07] a rushing mighty wind that can rush
[31:09] through a building and deliver sinners
[31:11] and convict sinners
[31:12] i was talking to an evangelist recent
[31:15] well maybe not recently last year so
[31:19] and he was telling me about how he was
[31:21] in his service and he was preaching away
[31:23] and he was at the end of the service it
[31:25] began to die down and he began to talk
[31:26] about how
[31:27] he began to say just by moved by the
[31:29] spirit i believe that god's still
[31:31] dealing with somebody
[31:32] and i just want to wait and wait and he
[31:34] began to linger and after a while after
[31:36] a few minutes somebody just
[31:37] rose up and they said it's me and they
[31:39] begin to shout as me
[31:40] i'm the one that you're talking about
[31:42] you see that's the supernatural dealing
[31:44] with somebody
[31:45] that supernatural can speak to a heart
[31:47] and say you're the one that i'm calling
[31:49] that's what the gospel does that pricks
[31:51] in the heart and calls and draws
[31:53] he's calling for you tonight he's
[31:55] calling he's pulling at you
[31:57] to come to him and give everything that
[31:59] you've got to him
[32:00] listen the word that the word is being
[32:02] preached is the most valuable thing
[32:04] that you'll ever come across in your
[32:06] life there's nothing in this life more
[32:08] valuable than the gospel
[32:10] the supernatural is will fill with the
[32:12] holy ghost you realize the world is
[32:15] actually looking for something genuine
[32:17] something that's something that can only
[32:19] be satisfied and presented by something
[32:22] supernatural
[32:23] the world is looking for a genuine
[32:25] christian the world is looking for the
[32:27] power of god
[32:28] on display the world is looking for a
[32:30] living bible a manifested word
[32:32] and let's say we've got i believe that
[32:34] we've got it we should share it we've
[32:36] got it let's
[32:37] let's put it on display this is a
[32:39] supernatural message
[32:42] revealing a supernatural god to a
[32:44] supernatural people
[32:48] now if we can just get away from
[32:49] thinking that we're just coming to
[32:50] church and
[32:51] do you know when i was up there in
[32:52] mccaseville i was quoting that quote
[32:54] where brother brown said that i think
[32:56] the brother that visited here a little
[32:57] bit
[32:58] a while he mentioned that that 80
[33:00] percent of the people
[33:01] 80 of christians don't even know why
[33:03] they go to church
[33:05] 80 percent of christians just come to
[33:07] church just to kind of
[33:08] sit around and be seen or or see
[33:12] or because somebody that they know did
[33:14] it but we're coming to church to be
[33:16] changed
[33:17] we're coming to church like brother and
[33:19] i'm saying in perfect strength by
[33:20] perfect weakness because we're broken
[33:22] messed up people that need something
[33:24] we're not coming because we're perfect
[33:26] but we're coming because the perfect one
[33:28] can change us to be like him
[33:30] [Applause]
[33:37] now brother braham said he he never
[33:39] commissioned his church then to go and
[33:41] teach the word
[33:43] he said preach the gospel or manifest
[33:46] the gospel
[33:48] and the gospel came not through word
[33:49] only but through the power and
[33:51] demonstrations of the holy spirit and i
[33:53] know that's tripped up so many people
[33:55] well see we're not supposed to teach the
[33:57] what does that mean you're not supposed
[33:58] to sit down and reason with somebody
[34:00] about what acts 2 38 means and
[34:02] reason what's up just have a good
[34:03] discussion we're not supposed to do any
[34:05] of that
[34:05] we're just supposed to take our brain
[34:07] out and just lay it over to the side and
[34:08] just go through life like a zombie
[34:10] and not reason or anything no that's not
[34:12] what he's saying
[34:13] he's saying what he's saying is listen
[34:16] let's dwell on what
[34:17] what the gospel really is the gospel is
[34:20] actually taking the
[34:21] the word for your day that proves that
[34:24] jesus christ is alive and real
[34:26] and that is what will transform lives
[34:29] you know
[34:30] i i believe that for years it was maybe
[34:32] taught that that before martin luther
[34:34] came on the scene that
[34:35] that maybe they read that that scripture
[34:37] many times in
[34:38] habakkuk and elsewhere in the bible it
[34:41] says the judge shall live by faith and
[34:42] they probably taught it
[34:43] they taught it but one day the
[34:45] supernatural touched the lips of that
[34:47] man
[34:48] and he began to say the just shall live
[34:50] by faith and it took on a new life then
[34:53] because now the supernatural had touched
[34:55] it and became a word for their day
[34:57] to get them out of that denominational
[34:59] that
[35:00] catholic system to bring them out of
[35:02] that to to open up a door out of that
[35:04] out of that age
[35:06] to where they could actually realize
[35:07] what god wanted him to see in that day
[35:09] that the just don't live by trying to
[35:12] work up something that you don't have to
[35:14] do something to be saved
[35:15] but the just shall live by faith you're
[35:18] saved by faith by grace through faith
[35:19] it's the grace of god
[35:21] and then you believe on that grace that
[35:23] he gives you and that's how you're saved
[35:27] so what is the gospel now second peter
[35:29] versus one through through 20 says now
[35:31] knowing this first
[35:33] that no prophecy of the scripture is of
[35:36] any private interpretation
[35:38] not just not just some things that we're
[35:40] we're thinking of
[35:41] coming up with our of our own self for
[35:43] the prophecy came not in old time by the
[35:45] will of man
[35:46] but holy men of god spake as they were
[35:50] moved
[35:51] by the holy ghost as they were moved by
[35:54] the holy ghost now i was reading a quote
[35:56] i don't have it with me so i can't
[35:57] remember what sermon it was in but
[35:59] brother brown was talking about when
[36:00] you're
[36:00] speaking under the holy spirit he said
[36:03] sometimes i'll say things that appear
[36:05] to contradict something that i already
[36:07] said and i'll ask myself
[36:09] am i a hypocrite am i you begin like for
[36:12] example he'll go into a church that's a
[36:13] little bit
[36:14] mortgage and he'll preach liven it up a
[36:16] little bit he'll preach a certain church
[36:18] that's a little bit leaning too much
[36:19] toward frolicking
[36:20] and he'll preach go back to the other
[36:22] direction why because he's balancing
[36:24] everybody up
[36:25] when you preach something under the holy
[36:27] spirit it's it actually
[36:29] brings life to the word it actually
[36:32] it makes it a living word it's not
[36:35] something that will just make you cold
[36:36] and formal
[36:37] but it'll make you live it'll make you
[36:39] live the gospel
[36:40] you're the real gospel when it's
[36:42] preached will actually deliver you from
[36:44] your sins
[36:45] it will actually it'll actually change
[36:47] you it'll actually
[36:48] it'll it'll open up your eyes and make
[36:50] you realize that your eyes were veiled
[36:52] and now you can see things
[36:54] as they truly what truly are now listen
[36:56] how brother brown said it and has the
[36:57] lord spoken only to moses
[36:59] he said the word is the beginning or the
[37:02] forerunner of the gospel
[37:04] so you got to be taught because the word
[37:06] foreruns the gospel
[37:09] his work he said the word goes out and
[37:12] the gospel of the power of the
[37:13] demonstration of god
[37:15] follows the word makes the word manifest
[37:18] so that's what the gospel is it's the
[37:21] manifestation
[37:22] of the word he said that is the gospel
[37:25] that's what the gospel is when the word
[37:27] is actually made
[37:28] visible when it's made real he said so
[37:32] it's not just the rich
[37:33] ritualistic affair but it's absolutely a
[37:36] real
[37:37] living reality of the resurrection of
[37:40] jesus christ
[37:40] living among men and that's the faith
[37:43] that i'm trying my best to contend for
[37:45] today
[37:46] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[37:48] today and forever
[37:50] and his power is unlimited his power is
[37:53] unlimited
[37:54] do you really that'll take the veil off
[37:56] your eyes when you realize that you
[37:58] like you know brother brother said what
[38:00] how foolish it would be for a mouse down
[38:02] in the grainers of egypt
[38:04] to eat sparingly i think well this is
[38:06] going to run out how foolish of us to be
[38:08] to eat sparingly from the word of god to
[38:11] eat sparingly from the master's table
[38:13] because we're at a table of unlimited
[38:15] power listen whatever you whatever you
[38:17] believe
[38:18] you can have it if it conforms to god's
[38:20] word you can have your healing
[38:22] you can have your salvation you can have
[38:24] the salvation of your family
[38:26] you can have the you can you can restore
[38:28] fellowship when it's lost
[38:30] whatever you need if you believe it
[38:32] because the power of god
[38:33] is unlimited you know now listen you say
[38:37] even when i'm preaching this i can kind
[38:39] of just feel that it just you just kind
[38:40] of draw up
[38:41] yeah i know but but what about my
[38:44] situation because why you've been
[38:45] sitting on that situation so long
[38:47] like the man that's been at the pool of
[38:49] bethesda sitting sitting there for so
[38:51] long and then
[38:52] jesus came by when jesus comes by when
[38:55] the supernatural is manifested it makes
[38:57] all the difference if we could just get
[38:59] the veil ripped away from our eyes so
[39:01] that we could see that god is still
[39:03] the same yesterday today and forever
[39:06] he's still the same as he was when he
[39:08] was preaching through brother branham
[39:09] he's still the same he's still the same
[39:12] if you could just believe that whatever
[39:14] you have need of you can still tap into
[39:16] that tree of life and receive it
[39:20] he said in the second coming he said the
[39:22] gospel is not
[39:23] go out and teach them the bible
[39:28] he said that isn't the gospel it said in
[39:30] the scriptures that the gospel didn't
[39:32] come to you just in word only
[39:34] listen because you teach somebody the
[39:35] bible that's great
[39:37] now they know the bible now they begin
[39:39] to kind of get a a humpty in their head
[39:41] i can i can quote more than you and i
[39:43] know more than all that but when you get
[39:44] a touch of the supernatural
[39:46] right it's supernatural he said the
[39:49] gospel that is the word
[39:50] but the letter killeth the spirit giveth
[39:53] life
[39:54] he said now a seed laid here on the
[39:56] puppy here is just a seed until it dies
[39:58] and becomes germatized germatize and
[40:00] dies it'll never do anything
[40:02] so the seed the word here has to be made
[40:04] manifest
[40:06] in order to be of god in order to be of
[40:09] god it's got to be men manifest now now
[40:11] what are you talking about brother bob
[40:12] i'm talking about when moses
[40:14] was taught he went and killed an
[40:16] egyptian and you see that's how the
[40:18] letter killeth
[40:19] that the letter will make people feel
[40:21] just just terrible and beat down on
[40:23] everything when the letter
[40:24] is just a letter but when their spirit
[40:26] is preached then that'll transform the
[40:28] message
[40:28] from from murder from killing it'll
[40:31] transform it and to let my people go and
[40:33] we're going out we're going out and
[40:35] we're being led by the holy spirit
[40:36] we're going out after after the pillar
[40:38] of fire being led by the supernatural
[40:41] with the word of god and the tables
[40:43] as they crossed over the jordan river
[40:46] brotherhood said in the mark of the
[40:48] beast and the seal of god he said in
[40:49] other words to preach the gospel
[40:51] would be to demonstrate the power of the
[40:53] holy spirit
[40:54] paul said the gospel come not in word
[40:57] only but through power
[40:58] manifestations of the holy spirit that's
[41:00] right it has to make the word manifest
[41:03] and if the spirit is in the word the
[41:05] true spirit of god
[41:06] in the word if you abide in me and my
[41:09] word and you
[41:10] ask what you will and it will be done to
[41:13] you amen
[41:13] you see you see what coming to church
[41:15] does it actually begins to line up our
[41:17] mind
[41:18] it begins to transform our minds so that
[41:20] we're thinking right
[41:21] you realize maybe maybe think of it this
[41:23] way the only thing
[41:24] standing between us and the rapture is
[41:27] our lack of understanding
[41:28] the lack of our spiritual understanding
[41:31] so that if the eyes of our oprah's
[41:32] understanding we're open
[41:34] to give you that to bring you the new
[41:35] birth the eyes of your understanding
[41:37] will
[41:37] one day be open to a revelation that you
[41:40] are going to be raptured
[41:42] and you'll step over that's what that's
[41:44] why we go to church because the word of
[41:46] god
[41:47] the quickened word of god actually has
[41:49] power to transform
[41:51] that's why brother brown said god never
[41:53] told a man to labor 30 years and harvest
[41:55] nothing
[41:56] he gave us the open door of word and
[41:58] power and that is what we are supposed
[42:01] to use
[42:02] he said if you're not seeing the results
[42:04] that jesus said you would see
[42:06] it's because you are not preaching the
[42:08] true gospel now
[42:10] to me that's that's not so much pushing
[42:12] down well that's pulling up
[42:13] to realize that if you're preaching the
[42:15] true gospel it's going to have an effect
[42:17] if you're believing the right word it's
[42:19] going to have an effect now
[42:21] it might be a long while while that ox
[42:23] is slogging through but one day you're
[42:25] going to come to the man
[42:26] one day you're going to come to the
[42:27] eagle and the ego will be flying it's
[42:29] going to take off
[42:30] because the spirit comes and rests upon
[42:32] the word
[42:35] brother abraham said amen the success of
[42:37] the church
[42:38] the success of the church lies within
[42:41] the preaching of the gospel
[42:42] of the power of god and the
[42:44] demonstration of the spirit
[42:45] he said that's the church in itself is
[42:48] god's spiritual revelation of his son
[42:50] that's made manifest to you and the
[42:52] power and demonstration of this holy
[42:54] spirit
[42:54] that's that's the success of the church
[42:57] that is
[42:58] the church that's that's if you're not
[43:00] seeing the results you're not preaching
[43:02] that
[43:03] but if you are it's because you're
[43:05] preaching that the
[43:06] everything that we are everything that
[43:08] we do stems from the gospel
[43:10] which is the manifested word for your
[43:12] day
[43:13] proving that jesus christ has raised
[43:15] from the dead that he's not still buried
[43:18] but he's still alive
[43:22] he said go you into all the world and
[43:23] preach the gospel these shines
[43:25] shall follow them that believe a
[43:26] manifestation a manifestation of the
[43:29] presence of the resurrected lord jesus
[43:31] and people who are spiritual conceptions
[43:34] receive it and believe it
[43:36] amen now he said it's the word
[43:39] it's the word turned on the light turns
[43:43] on the mechanics
[43:44] and they become dynamics
[43:47] they are dynamics when the dynamics
[43:50] comes to the mechanic
[43:52] he said it starts the thing rolling
[43:53] that's right take the word
[43:55] if there is one little thing missed up
[43:57] on it it won't start
[43:59] i know if you get your your teaching
[44:02] right get everything situated
[44:04] it's gonna start if you get it all the
[44:07] groundwork
[44:07] do you realize what this message is for
[44:09] us we
[44:11] needed something to connect us to the
[44:13] supernatural
[44:14] and all the denominational teaching
[44:17] won't connect that's why
[44:18] that's why they don't have nothing but
[44:20] coffee shops and why they don't have
[44:22] nothing but people in shorts and
[44:23] dreadlocks preaching behind
[44:25] little glass pulpits and because they've
[44:26] taken the supernatural away
[44:28] but the message of the hour actually
[44:30] puts the supernatural back into the
[44:32] belief back into the church
[44:34] why because the truth is the truth it's
[44:36] the truth to connect you to connect your
[44:39] earth
[44:39] to the supernatural to connect you to
[44:41] another realm and when you connect to
[44:43] pieces
[44:44] then you've got a spark you're going to
[44:45] have something to give a jolt into the
[44:47] church
[44:48] listen you know brother brown he even
[44:50] said he talked about how when
[44:51] the lake talking about laying on of
[44:53] hands when you lay hands on somebody
[44:55] then the spirit of god is actually
[44:57] passing from one to another it's
[44:59] actually
[45:00] something real listen
[45:03] this is not not a good place to testify
[45:05] and not that kind of forum but i
[45:06] i have been a witness to that being in
[45:08] meetings and things where somebody come
[45:10] and lay hands on you
[45:11] and you talk about there's some power
[45:14] behind
[45:14] a real dedicated believer a real
[45:17] dedicated son or daughter of god that
[45:19] puts their hands on you
[45:20] something is actually happening why
[45:22] because there's a supernatural something
[45:24] working in a supernatural realm at place
[45:27] you see we're not just studying about
[45:29] something to know more than somebody
[45:30] else to know more about the
[45:32] other churches and so we can argue and
[45:34] debate about things
[45:35] but we're we're actually getting in
[45:36] touch with god almighty god
[45:38] in touch with the supernatural
[45:42] he said it starts the thing rolling
[45:43] that's right take the word
[45:45] if there's one little thing messed up on
[45:46] it it won't start he said lay aside
[45:49] every weight
[45:50] every ism every creed that the dynamics
[45:53] the holy spirit might flow
[45:55] through the word and vindicate the word
[45:57] that's promised of this day
[45:59] then the great church of god will rise
[46:01] to her feet like a jet propelled plane
[46:04] take off to the skies to meet her master
[46:08] all right my if we could get that a
[46:09] revelation of what he's really saying
[46:11] there then we wouldn't pity patty around
[46:13] with the bible and with the message
[46:14] we wouldn't let just the minister of
[46:16] study it out but we'd actually get
[46:17] serious with god
[46:19] and get on our knees and get to lay our
[46:20] bible open and begin to pour through the
[46:22] scriptures
[46:23] and find out what the message is really
[46:26] about listen i i believe that we should
[46:29] be sold out to the word
[46:31] but god won't that's the kind of person
[46:33] that's going to take a body change
[46:34] somebody that's so sold out to the world
[46:36] that they're going to be in the word
[46:38] all the way they're just going to be
[46:39] eaten and eaten continually they're
[46:41] going to lay aside all the movies
[46:43] they're going to lay aside all the
[46:44] magazines
[46:45] they're going to feast on that word
[46:46] until they actually become the word
[46:48] until their mind is transformed by the
[46:50] word until their body is transformed by
[46:52] the word their character their life
[46:54] everything is transformed by
[46:56] the word because they value they found
[46:58] the pearl of great price
[46:59] they cast everything away until they
[47:02] actually
[47:02] they actually become that thing that
[47:04] they found
[47:07] brother brown said that's exactly right
[47:08] until we do that it won't work
[47:10] that's what about yes sir who will do it
[47:13] who will keep it
[47:14] in this day that we're thinking about he
[47:16] said remember
[47:18] remember brother
[47:21] there's going to be a lot of remembering
[47:23] there's going to be a lot of remembering
[47:24] on the day of judgment looking back and
[47:26] remembering the sermons that are
[47:27] preached to the things that we're saying
[47:28] remember
[47:31] but now it's time to remember the words
[47:33] of encouragement amen
[47:34] listen we're we're not hearing the words
[47:36] of man but we're hearing something that
[47:38] echoed straight from calvary
[47:40] two thousand years ago it's echoing down
[47:42] into the hearts of believers that will
[47:44] believe what was done for them two
[47:45] thousand years ago
[47:46] and all the things that were preached by
[47:48] the son of man
[47:52] 1 23 says turn you at my reproof behold
[47:55] i will pour out my spirit upon you
[47:57] how is he going to pour out his spirit
[47:58] upon you i will make my words
[48:01] known unto you is what the scripture
[48:02] says that's how he pours a spirit out by
[48:05] the word
[48:06] he lays the connector out the words and
[48:08] then
[48:09] that provides an avenue for the spirit
[48:11] to move in john chapter 6 verse 63 it
[48:14] says it is the spirit that quickeneth
[48:16] the flesh profiteth nothing the words
[48:18] that i speak unto you
[48:19] they are spirit and they are life why
[48:21] that because it's not something that's
[48:23] just taught
[48:24] but that is the gospel the gospel has
[48:27] life in it
[48:27] life to change and that's what brother
[48:29] and i said the sign of the resurrection
[48:32] confirms the word he said he had there
[48:35] there as though they went down on the
[48:36] road to emmaus and went down into that
[48:38] little
[48:38] little building there something was done
[48:40] the supernatural was made evident
[48:42] now now whatever you believe about what
[48:44] was happening there had to be something
[48:46] something to identify the supernatural
[48:48] working of christ that he did
[48:50] before the resurrect before before he
[48:52] died on the cross
[48:53] to show that he was still alive brother
[48:56] robert said and it came to pass as he
[48:57] set at meat with him he took bread and
[48:59] blessed it and break it and cave to them
[49:01] gave to them and their eyes were opened
[49:03] and they knew him and he vanished
[49:05] out of their sight and he said then you
[49:07] see it takes the accompanying
[49:08] of the sign of resurrection to confirm
[49:11] the word to make jesus
[49:12] positive known to the people and what
[49:14] what's the sign of the erection the
[49:16] resurrection
[49:17] i i believe we all we're coming to the
[49:19] point where we identify the sign of the
[49:21] resurrection
[49:22] with the sign of the son of man which is
[49:24] god revealing himself back in flesh
[49:26] again
[49:27] not just moving through the service
[49:29] heaven church ages and in the form of
[49:31] the manifestation the office of the son
[49:32] of god
[49:33] part word able to quicken part word but
[49:36] now with the full word laid bare before
[49:38] us
[49:39] the fool if you've got the word it
[49:40] allows the spirit to move right
[49:42] so if you've got the full word it allows
[49:44] the full spirit of god to be manifested
[49:46] in the hearts and lives of the church
[49:48] the full the full word which will
[49:50] resurrect you from your dead
[49:52] denominational ideas
[49:53] from your old carnal way of looking
[49:55] actually brings to pass
[49:57] it actually makes visible the sign of
[49:59] the resurrection
[50:00] the sign of the resurrection to bring
[50:02] the dead back from life
[50:04] the sign of the resurrection to bring
[50:06] life into the church
[50:07] to put life into you
[50:11] which is why brother brown quoted so
[50:12] often mark 16 and these signs shall
[50:14] follow them that believe
[50:16] in my name they shall cast out devils
[50:17] they shall speak with new tongues
[50:19] because where god is in the midst you're
[50:22] going to have the sign of the
[50:23] resurrection
[50:24] it's unavoidable where the true word is
[50:26] preaching you're going to have healings
[50:28] you're going to have thing when when
[50:30] trouble arises afflictions arise
[50:32] god is there to meet every need meet
[50:35] every affliction
[50:37] and brother said now he appears he
[50:39] appears to the elected believer
[50:42] he didn't appear to no one but his
[50:43] elected church he only appears to
[50:46] believers
[50:47] now today he still only appears to his
[50:49] elected church
[50:51] there were many who taught of messiah in
[50:53] those days
[50:54] and there were many who looked for a
[50:56] coming messiah
[50:57] but he had a church that was elected he
[51:00] had a church just like
[51:01] those two little individual cleopas and
[51:03] his friend that he he appeared to them
[51:05] he didn't go
[51:06] brother braham said he said he never
[51:08] appeared to caiaphas
[51:09] or the orthodox church he doesn't show
[51:12] himself
[51:13] to those that have have died all those
[51:15] organizational systems that have died
[51:17] and now they're just
[51:18] called up and just singing songs in a
[51:20] choir with lipstick
[51:22] and and going out to the beach dressing
[51:24] dressing like the world and
[51:25] now you can't tell any difference
[51:27] between the world and what the
[51:28] denominational systems have become
[51:31] because the supernatural is not made
[51:33] manifest in them anymore
[51:34] all they all they have become as lodges
[51:37] of coffee drinkers and
[51:39] and and people that just maybe tell tell
[51:41] maybe because some good teaching
[51:42] but the supernatural is not not there to
[51:45] make manifest
[51:46] that christ is still alive
[51:50] he said there were many who looked for a
[51:52] coming messiah but he had a church that
[51:54] he was elected
[51:55] and if he was here today he would do
[51:57] just the same as he did then
[51:59] appear to the elected believer he said
[52:02] he never appears to the unbeliever
[52:04] he said i've always told you that god is
[52:06] infinite and cannot change and if that
[52:08] was his attitude towards the world then
[52:10] after his resurrection it's the same
[52:13] thing today
[52:14] and jesus witnessed the same thing by
[52:16] saying as it was
[52:18] in the days of sodom and the days of
[52:20] sodom when he manifested himself
[52:22] came in flesh to abraham sitting there
[52:25] looking over
[52:25] at sodom and gomorrah as it was in the
[52:28] days of sodom so shall it be
[52:30] in the coming of the son of man so shall
[52:32] it be in the coming of the son of man
[52:34] when he manifests
[52:35] manifests the sign of the resurrection
[52:37] to the little
[52:38] group of elected believers to the little
[52:41] elected church
[52:42] that have the word which makes way for
[52:45] the spirit
[52:48] excuse me he said after the resurrection
[52:51] he never appeared to caiaphas
[52:54] the elected group is what saw god
[52:57] manifested in the flesh
[52:58] death couldn't hold him the sign of the
[53:00] resurrection
[53:02] and he said he has come in the form of
[53:04] the holy spirit
[53:05] to the elected church and we are to take
[53:08] him to unbelievers we're the ones
[53:10] that's to let his life shine through us
[53:12] that others
[53:13] might believe as us christ in the church
[53:16] that shines forth his presence
[53:18] to make him visible to all you know that
[53:21] that makes the message
[53:22] a positive gospel it makes a positive
[53:24] thing that to know that you've got
[53:26] something that you can give to other
[53:28] people
[53:28] that's really what i when i give up the
[53:30] behind the poop when i meditate on these
[53:32] things i
[53:32] i don't want to preach a gospel that
[53:34] will take but i want to preach
[53:36] a gospel that will give we were sharing
[53:38] with some people recently about how
[53:39] that's really what i believe a ministry
[53:41] is is like
[53:42] a candle that you you once you light it
[53:44] it gives itself up so that it can give a
[53:46] light to other people
[53:47] that's what not just a minister but
[53:49] that's what a christian is somebody
[53:51] that's on fire for god that
[53:52] that really gives their gifts gives
[53:55] himself up heals himself up so that
[53:57] other people
[53:58] can have light to see by listen jesus
[54:00] taught that we don't put a bushel over a
[54:02] light we don't hide our light but we
[54:04] take that light into our workplace and
[54:06] into our into our church and we give
[54:08] something that other people can benefit
[54:10] from
[54:11] i i i texted brother wade a little quote
[54:13] uh earlier that week where
[54:15] where brother brown was talking about
[54:16] listen all the other denominations
[54:18] everybody else in the world has
[54:19] entertainment
[54:20] they've got all their soup suppers and
[54:22] all the different things so we don't
[54:23] we're not here to give people
[54:25] soup suppers and entertainment and and
[54:27] ministers that know really how to
[54:29] entertain and
[54:30] slickers and things that can entertain
[54:31] somebody because the world's got all the
[54:33] entertainment they specialize in that
[54:36] but we got something that they don't
[54:37] have we got the light of the word we got
[54:39] the light of the gospel
[54:41] that's what we're doing here is to give
[54:42] something that they ain't got
[54:45] you you realize that's what a lot of
[54:47] young people they get that pull of
[54:48] things out in the world they get pulled
[54:50] by
[54:50] stuff that's going on in the world but
[54:52] if if they can realize that they can get
[54:54] something to hear
[54:55] that they can't get out there it'll
[54:57] change it'll change something
[55:00] he said we're the ones that's to let his
[55:02] life shine us through that others might
[55:04] believe
[55:05] it's us christ in the church that shines
[55:07] forth his presence to make him visible
[55:09] to all
[55:10] so therefore when he shines himself
[55:12] forth through the lives of his elected
[55:14] believers
[55:14] those who are elected to eternal life
[55:17] receive him but admire you
[55:19] to think that the light of god is in the
[55:21] believer so much that you can actually
[55:23] give eternal life
[55:24] to somebody else by sharing that light
[55:26] that is in you
[55:27] you can actually speak words of
[55:29] encouragement and life to give eternal
[55:31] life to somebody else
[55:33] he said he manifested himself to his
[55:35] called out an elected church he does the
[55:37] same thing to the church today
[55:39] to manifest himself through his beings
[55:42] us the church
[55:43] called out church and that is the
[55:45] greatest
[55:46] news flash in history that's the
[55:48] greatest news story that could ever be
[55:50] it's greater than what the president's
[55:52] doing it's greater than
[55:53] any kind of titanic sinking or anything
[55:55] that's ever happened in history
[55:57] it's greater than alexander the great
[55:58] conqueror in the world it's greater than
[56:00] anything that you can pull out at the
[56:02] library
[56:03] that god is still alive and he's moving
[56:05] and showing himself in the lives of his
[56:07] people
[56:08] and the lives of his church brother
[56:09] abraham said our message is truly the
[56:12] greatest
[56:12] news flash that history's ever known he
[56:15] said we buried him dead but he's up
[56:17] and alive again he was dead when we
[56:20] buried him and now he's alive
[56:21] forevermore
[56:22] it's truly the facts he is not dead
[56:26] but he's alive forevermore my that
[56:29] how that should stir the heart of a
[56:31] believer to know that
[56:32] this power that has been given into the
[56:34] church power power to overcome all that
[56:36] depression
[56:37] power to overcome all that worldliness
[56:39] power to overcome the way that you used
[56:41] to live
[56:42] power to be a real christian
[56:45] hitting it a joy to be a christian he
[56:47] said it makes a headline in the heart of
[56:49] the believer
[56:50] when he sees it and recognizes it
[56:52] thrills him above
[56:53] everything that could be ever done it
[56:55] throws a headline that flashes
[56:57] everything else of the world dead and he
[57:00] said if you say
[57:02] if you say you are a believer and those
[57:04] signs does not follow you
[57:06] if you say you are a believer and those
[57:08] signs to prove that the resurrection
[57:11] is real that he really has resurrected
[57:14] he said then you have
[57:15] you either have told something wrong or
[57:18] say
[57:19] that he said something wrong that's a
[57:21] strong statement now
[57:23] that's a strong statement when you come
[57:24] to a problem in your life a place of
[57:26] contention in your life and
[57:28] you realize that maybe you're not
[57:29] looking at the word in the right way
[57:32] maybe you haven't been in touch with the
[57:33] supernatural
[57:34] maybe so far it's just been taught to
[57:36] you but when you
[57:37] let god get a hold of you and quicken
[57:40] that word and
[57:41] make it rise up off of the pages then
[57:44] you'll be able to tell the doctor i'm
[57:45] healed
[57:46] then you'll be able to tell the people
[57:47] that say things about you at work i met
[57:50] the master
[57:51] something's been changed in my life
[57:54] because brother adam said the word will
[57:56] produce these signs shall follow the
[57:58] believer in my name they shall cast out
[58:00] devils speak with new tongues
[58:02] if they if they lay hands on the sick
[58:04] they shall recover
[58:05] those are strong words but these are
[58:07] promises of god that we can lay at his
[58:09] feet
[58:09] and claim it when we have need of
[58:11] something signs of that type fall as the
[58:13] believer
[58:15] so brother brown said come and see like
[58:16] like earlier on in that chapter there we
[58:18] were reading how
[58:19] the angel said come and see where he
[58:21] laid come and see
[58:23] now brother let's let's pay close
[58:25] attention to how brother brown lays this
[58:26] that we got something behind us
[58:28] something with us and something force
[58:29] going on
[58:30] before he said that was that was what he
[58:32] told the women that the angel that
[58:34] morning at the grave come and see where
[58:35] he was laid
[58:36] he ain't there now now brother brown
[58:38] said if he ain't
[58:39] there he's got to be somewhere so we got
[58:42] to find out where he is now if he ain't
[58:44] there
[58:45] if he ain't stealing the grave then
[58:47] where is he
[58:48] is he in the methodist church is he in
[58:49] the baptist church is he with the
[58:51] presbyterian
[58:52] i know this is maybe strong talk a
[58:54] little bit but let's well you got to
[58:55] find out where he is
[58:57] because if you really if your heart's
[58:59] really in it and you really want to know
[59:02] where christ is where he's at come and
[59:05] see where he was laid but he's not there
[59:07] no more
[59:08] now isn't that what philip told
[59:09] nathanael come and see if nathan was
[59:11] like
[59:11] can any good thing come out of nazareth
[59:13] come and see come come and see
[59:15] what come and see what the sign of the
[59:17] resurrection the sign of what you've
[59:19] been taught
[59:20] may manifest before your eyes so you can
[59:22] see it
[59:23] and then and brother brother said the
[59:25] angel said come and see
[59:26] where he was laid then go tell his
[59:28] disciples that i'll meet you in galilee
[59:31] tell who his bewildered disciples and he
[59:33] said they were certainly
[59:35] bewildered they didn't know what to do
[59:37] they wanted to go back to catching
[59:38] fishes
[59:39] you see what brother brown said catching
[59:41] fishes was he said
[59:42] we got to really watch what kind of a
[59:44] meeting we cooperate with
[59:46] catching fish is to be concerned being
[59:48] concerned about
[59:49] everything else except where the sign of
[59:52] the resurrection is
[59:53] being concerned about who's who's
[59:55] internet now this is what brother brown
[59:56] said being concerned about who's going
[59:58] to
[59:58] other churches and who's going who's
[1:00:00] leaving and going over here and this is
[1:00:02] all this kind of stuff who's being
[1:00:04] concerned about
[1:00:05] churches swapping one person from one to
[1:00:07] the other that's what that's what the
[1:00:09] denominational system is worried about
[1:00:12] we lost this one over to the baptist
[1:00:13] church we lost this one to the
[1:00:14] presbyterian let's see how many we can
[1:00:16] get to flock to our church
[1:00:18] so that we can build numbers god's not
[1:00:20] always in numbers
[1:00:23] god is where his word is he said we got
[1:00:26] to really watch what kind of a meeting
[1:00:27] we cooperate with
[1:00:29] the disparate district superintendent
[1:00:30] will turn us out if we go down to such
[1:00:33] and such a meeting the pastor will turn
[1:00:34] us out
[1:00:35] the bishop will do something to us
[1:00:36] catching fish as you see catches
[1:00:38] concerned about catching fishes the
[1:00:40] bishop will do something to
[1:00:42] us so the church will excommunicate us
[1:00:44] oh we're so busy watching our members to
[1:00:46] see that they don't go to no other
[1:00:47] church
[1:00:48] or have anything else to do but just a
[1:00:50] little click you see how many times
[1:00:52] brother brown
[1:00:52] was preaching on former little clique
[1:00:55] when you got your little
[1:00:56] click then you're watching that and
[1:00:57] you're instead of watching the word
[1:00:59] you're watching one another and
[1:01:00] watching what each of you do when you
[1:01:02] you got your little click where you got
[1:01:03] a little intellectual idea maybe what
[1:01:05] you think
[1:01:06] should be done and you start criticizing
[1:01:08] pointing fingers at one another
[1:01:10] but he said if we'll just he said we're
[1:01:12] so busy
[1:01:13] took up with so many different things
[1:01:16] the church has got so much to do
[1:01:18] and so busy about this and that we
[1:01:20] haven't got time to look into these
[1:01:22] things
[1:01:23] what things where the resurrected sign
[1:01:25] of the son of man
[1:01:26] is where is he at if he's not in the
[1:01:28] grave where is he
[1:01:30] he said why not take a little time to
[1:01:32] study it out sit down before him
[1:01:34] and come let us reason together they had
[1:01:36] trusted that he was the messiah and here
[1:01:38] he was dead
[1:01:39] and they didn't know what to do now go
[1:01:41] tell his bewildered church
[1:01:43] that i am alive and i'll go before him
[1:01:46] he said he said they
[1:01:47] they became comforted by a past
[1:01:49] experience listen
[1:01:50] there's some real nuggets here y'all
[1:01:52] y'all try to stay awake hang on with me
[1:01:55] go ahead they became comforted by a past
[1:01:58] experience maybe remembering all the
[1:02:00] times that they had crossed the shore of
[1:02:01] galilee and
[1:02:03] he came walking on the water in the
[1:02:05] middle of the storm and raising the dead
[1:02:07] and
[1:02:08] doing all those things and that was a
[1:02:09] comfort to them now listen listen to
[1:02:11] what brother brahman said a comfort to
[1:02:12] the church is now
[1:02:13] that we we base our experience we base
[1:02:16] everything on acts 2
[1:02:18] and 4. now that sounds like something
[1:02:21] that would be good to base your
[1:02:22] experience on daddy
[1:02:26] he said he said the church today is a
[1:02:30] great deal that way even to the
[1:02:31] pentecostals trying to satisfy
[1:02:33] themselves
[1:02:34] with acts 2 4 some past experience
[1:02:38] but all that message of the living god
[1:02:41] still lives today
[1:02:42] why are you bewildered i go before you
[1:02:45] i'm not dead i'm alive what's acts two
[1:02:47] and four you might not be able to
[1:02:48] remember but acts two and four says
[1:02:50] they were all filled with the holy ghost
[1:02:53] and began to speak with other tongues as
[1:02:55] a spirit gave their mothers
[1:02:57] now isn't that how a lot of christians
[1:02:58] do today they come and sit in the church
[1:03:01] and they look back to when they were
[1:03:02] baptized and filled with the holy ghost
[1:03:05] that's great that's what the
[1:03:07] pentecostals did that was
[1:03:08] that's what brother brown said when he
[1:03:09] preached where pentecost failed that
[1:03:11] they
[1:03:12] were fine with being born again and then
[1:03:14] they just stopped that that was good
[1:03:16] enough and they look back to that past
[1:03:18] experience and that's good enough and
[1:03:19] that's where you always mess up that's
[1:03:21] where you
[1:03:22] that's where you get in trouble he said
[1:03:23] 40 years later here we find ourselves
[1:03:26] still
[1:03:27] acts 2 and 4. god might come in with
[1:03:30] something else with some more of his
[1:03:32] blessings and they say
[1:03:33] glory to god we didn't have that
[1:03:35] hallelujah we believe acts 2 and 4.
[1:03:37] here our forefathers organize this if
[1:03:40] they don't come up to this
[1:03:41] what's he talking about he said the sign
[1:03:43] of the resurrection
[1:03:45] is moving on moving on to more of the
[1:03:47] word to allow
[1:03:48] more of the spirit to come in more more
[1:03:50] working and you get so tied up maybe
[1:03:52] with looking back at
[1:03:53] something that now how many times people
[1:03:55] will testify
[1:03:57] i remember 20 years ago god did
[1:03:59] something well that's true which is
[1:04:00] great
[1:04:01] we love testimony i remember 20 years
[1:04:03] ago i saw
[1:04:04] god moving and do something in
[1:04:05] somebody's life but what about now
[1:04:07] what's he doing for you now i want to
[1:04:09] hear a
[1:04:10] current present reality of god actually
[1:04:12] moving in your life
[1:04:14] because he's not a god of the past but
[1:04:16] you know brother brahma even said that's
[1:04:18] why so many times we look back we like
[1:04:20] to look back
[1:04:21] and go to renfroe valley we like to go
[1:04:23] we like to go up to dollywood maybe and
[1:04:25] where they got old iron skillets and
[1:04:27] stuff because we like
[1:04:28] there's something within you to look
[1:04:30] back and he said
[1:04:31] there's a desire to look back to the
[1:04:33] original word
[1:04:35] and that's actually why you like going
[1:04:37] back to renfro valley and stuff you like
[1:04:39] going
[1:04:40] you want to go back to the way that
[1:04:42] things
[1:04:43] used to be a simpler time because
[1:04:45] there's something in you to long
[1:04:47] for the original word for the way that
[1:04:50] god
[1:04:51] originally put everything in place
[1:04:56] he said that's all right acts 2 4 is
[1:04:58] part of it but the thing of it is he
[1:05:00] said one day two years he said rise
[1:05:02] you've been on this mountain for 40
[1:05:04] years
[1:05:05] turn north across jordan yawn to the
[1:05:07] separation for there's more than this
[1:05:09] mountain for you
[1:05:10] there's more than acts 2 4 for you every
[1:05:12] promise in the book belongs to the
[1:05:14] church
[1:05:15] and god's waiting for his church to rise
[1:05:17] and receive it
[1:05:18] so he's going before us now we're doing
[1:05:22] all right with the time hold on
[1:05:23] hang on now in matthew 28 verses 5 to 7
[1:05:26] it says
[1:05:27] the angel talking to him and he said to
[1:05:29] mary he's not here for he's risen as he
[1:05:32] said come see the place where the lord
[1:05:33] lay
[1:05:34] he's risen from the tomb he was alive
[1:05:37] among them
[1:05:38] and he was going before them he was
[1:05:40] going before them to lead them
[1:05:41] brother brown said to a certain
[1:05:43] designation and the designation
[1:05:46] is the action of choosing a place for a
[1:05:49] special purpose
[1:05:50] or giving it a special status
[1:05:53] and the designation that we're marching
[1:05:56] toward
[1:05:57] is a change of the body that's why in
[1:05:59] first thessalonians
[1:06:00] he quoted that then we which are alive
[1:06:02] and remain shall be caught up together
[1:06:04] with them in the clouds
[1:06:06] to meet the lord and the air and so
[1:06:07] shall we ever be with the lord
[1:06:09] wherefore comfort one another with these
[1:06:11] words comfort one another with the
[1:06:13] promise that we're going
[1:06:15] to a designation a special place
[1:06:18] reserved that god is leading us onto by
[1:06:22] by his resurrected power that he's not
[1:06:25] dead he's somewhere
[1:06:26] he's somewhere he's actually in in the
[1:06:29] church
[1:06:30] brotherhood said now the message is he
[1:06:31] goes before us
[1:06:33] he goes before us he's not in a tomb
[1:06:35] behind us
[1:06:36] he's before us making a way we are to
[1:06:39] fallen not to look back to the tomb
[1:06:41] but to look forward to where he's
[1:06:43] leading for he's our leader
[1:06:45] we're to look we're to follow him not
[1:06:47] look back to the tombs
[1:06:52] trying to find where i put that in my
[1:06:54] news
[1:06:56] he said he said cleopas and his friend
[1:06:59] met the resurrected christ he said oh
[1:07:01] after they found out the truth that he
[1:07:03] was resurrected
[1:07:04] because they'd seen him keep his word
[1:07:07] and fulfill it and do exactly like he
[1:07:09] did before he was crucified
[1:07:11] they hot-footed it across the country i
[1:07:14] imagine they were just hitting every
[1:07:15] four or five yards
[1:07:16] they were in a hurry because they they
[1:07:18] met they resurrected christ they saw him
[1:07:21] fulfilling his word
[1:07:22] he said they wanted to tell the rest of
[1:07:24] them truly the lord is risen indeed
[1:07:27] they had something in their hearts and
[1:07:29] he said
[1:07:30] brother brown said they looked to jesus
[1:07:33] only
[1:07:34] when they heard that jesus had raised
[1:07:36] from the dead
[1:07:37] and appeared among them like that they
[1:07:39] didn't stand and look at one another
[1:07:41] and that what somebody i was someone was
[1:07:42] actually telling me the other day that
[1:07:44] the reason why somebody they knew had
[1:07:45] left the message was because they got to
[1:07:47] looking at people
[1:07:48] and they got to looking at people not
[1:07:49] unable to overcome and you
[1:07:52] see you're going to have that you're
[1:07:53] going to you're going to have people
[1:07:54] that just can't quite
[1:07:56] break through you're gonna and that
[1:07:57] problem is when you begin to look at
[1:07:58] other people
[1:07:59] look at other ministers and things look
[1:08:01] at look at if you get your eyes right
[1:08:03] if you get your eyes on the word you'll
[1:08:05] begin to realize maybe that
[1:08:07] things maybe that you heard around the
[1:08:08] message around the denominational ideas
[1:08:11] aren't the way that it really is keep
[1:08:14] your eyes on christ
[1:08:15] don't look for gimmicks or secrets just
[1:08:17] or look for somebody to rise up but just
[1:08:19] keep your eyes right on the word
[1:08:21] he said they've seen his scars they've
[1:08:23] seen his power
[1:08:24] they've seen him do the miracles that he
[1:08:26] did before he was dead
[1:08:27] and they know that it was their living
[1:08:29] god and they didn't look to one another
[1:08:32] neither did they ask anybody to look to
[1:08:34] them
[1:08:35] they just said look at god look at look
[1:08:37] at christ look at his word
[1:08:39] he said don't look towards those poor
[1:08:41] mournful garlic eaters back there back
[1:08:43] in the wilderness
[1:08:44] one of the flesh pots of egypt don't
[1:08:46] look at don't look at other sinners that
[1:08:48] are around the message people that
[1:08:49] haven't overcome don't look at somebody
[1:08:51] that hadn't broke through
[1:08:52] that's still wearing shorts and dresses
[1:08:55] and painted lips
[1:08:56] these are his words and cutting their
[1:08:58] hair and denying the power of god
[1:09:00] let them alone he said don't look back
[1:09:02] to them don't pay any attention to them
[1:09:04] we look to jesus we look to joshua
[1:09:08] who's leading us on amen amen now
[1:09:11] brother rahm said
[1:09:14] remembering this that we have something
[1:09:16] behind us
[1:09:17] and he quoted the scripture that where
[1:09:19] jesus said all power
[1:09:21] in heavens and earth is given unto me
[1:09:24] now you see what a promise that is if
[1:09:26] all power in heaven and earth is given
[1:09:28] to him
[1:09:29] and he's living inside of you then now
[1:09:32] you got something to back you up
[1:09:35] that's that's actually that's actually
[1:09:36] what when i when i
[1:09:38] when i first started ministry yeah you
[1:09:40] can applaud that
[1:09:41] when i when i first started ministering
[1:09:43] somebody kind of gave me a little word
[1:09:44] of encouragement they said you know when
[1:09:45] you get up behind the pooping
[1:09:47] it's like you're at the tip of a spear
[1:09:49] and you got all heaven behind you
[1:09:51] and you in other words you got some
[1:09:53] backup now now listen
[1:09:55] that's that's how every christian is not
[1:09:57] just a minister you
[1:09:58] you got some backup when you when things
[1:10:01] begin to fall apart in your life
[1:10:03] you got back up that you can fall back
[1:10:05] on
[1:10:06] you that's many times our problem is we
[1:10:08] when things begin to fall apart we want
[1:10:10] to get our hands all over and we want to
[1:10:11] try to fix it but if you'll just
[1:10:13] come to a place where you realize that
[1:10:15] you got some backup that could do things
[1:10:17] that you can't do
[1:10:18] because he said all power is given unto
[1:10:21] me
[1:10:21] all power all power that means
[1:10:25] all the power you ain't never met
[1:10:28] anybody with that kind of power that can
[1:10:30] that can meet every need that you've got
[1:10:32] that can satisfy
[1:10:33] every every gap in your life close up
[1:10:36] every wound
[1:10:39] he said to every promise that he made
[1:10:41] because all power is given unto him
[1:10:43] something to back us up so that means
[1:10:45] that there's somebody behind us
[1:10:48] something in us and something before us
[1:10:51] somebody behind us to back us up
[1:10:54] somebody with us
[1:10:55] and somebody leading he's something
[1:10:58] leading us on where to go
[1:10:59] to the designation to go to the
[1:11:02] designated place of body change
[1:11:04] but that's what brotherhood said he was
[1:11:06] he is and shall come the same jesus that
[1:11:09] was
[1:11:09] is the same jesus tonight and the same
[1:11:12] jesus that shall come the same yesterday
[1:11:15] today and forever
[1:11:17] come believe and go and some tell
[1:11:20] somebody about it
[1:11:21] he said his life what he was to us is
[1:11:24] his back life
[1:11:25] his life what he was to us is his back
[1:11:28] life
[1:11:28] and this is such a profound statement
[1:11:31] hang on with me just
[1:11:32] while i quote a few more things he said
[1:11:34] he gave us
[1:11:36] what he was so that we would not be
[1:11:39] deceived
[1:11:41] in what he is today amen he gave
[1:11:44] us now what he was
[1:11:47] so that you would not be deceived so you
[1:11:50] would be able to recognize
[1:11:52] christ resurrected in your midst that's
[1:11:54] why he said don't take
[1:11:56] anybody's word for it take god's word
[1:11:59] for it amen
[1:12:00] amen and brother said he stayed with the
[1:12:03] message from the father he stayed with
[1:12:04] the scriptures
[1:12:05] he's saying that's how cleopas and his
[1:12:07] friend were able to recognize him
[1:12:10] were able to discern that he was true
[1:12:13] because he stayed with the scriptures
[1:12:15] he stayed with the scriptures as not it
[1:12:17] written in your scriptures no matter
[1:12:19] what they wanted to see
[1:12:20] and what they wanted to do they wanted
[1:12:21] him to raise up this one and do that one
[1:12:23] he said i do
[1:12:25] what the father shows me to do i do
[1:12:27] nothing in myself but what i see the
[1:12:29] father doing at first that's why
[1:12:31] he's the same today he appeared to us
[1:12:34] yesterday and proved what he was behind
[1:12:36] us
[1:12:37] that he might be what's in us and a
[1:12:40] substitutionary thought in our mind
[1:12:43] of what he will be in other words that
[1:12:46] you've got in your mind that you are
[1:12:48] going to take a body change
[1:12:50] he said if it's this glorious when he
[1:12:52] comes down among us now what will it be
[1:12:54] when we have a body like his
[1:12:56] then we see we got something in the back
[1:12:59] we got some back up
[1:13:00] going before us going on before us to
[1:13:03] prepare a place for us
[1:13:04] he's gone he is he was he see what we
[1:13:07] was we look back
[1:13:08] and see what he was so we see
[1:13:11] what he is today and i'm gonna close on
[1:13:13] that note the musicians can come forward
[1:13:15] so you see what we've got the greatest
[1:13:18] news flash in history
[1:13:19] to declare that he's not dead we have
[1:13:21] not believed just some teachings of man
[1:13:24] that cannot accomplish something they
[1:13:26] cannot deliver they cannot set the
[1:13:28] captive free
[1:13:29] but we've actually received a message of
[1:13:31] the supernatural
[1:13:33] we received a supernatural message
[1:13:35] declaring that he is not dead
[1:13:38] but he is alive glory
[1:13:43] he said beyond a shadow of doubt you're
[1:13:45] not dead but you're alive forevermore
