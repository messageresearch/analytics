========================================

but there's a little bit but it's God that does the drawing if any said if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth them but you know him for he dwelleth in you with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you and so you can see that the new birth is a sign it's a seal it's an assurance it's all those things but it's also a comforter it's the comforter because it will give you comfort when all all the things around you go straight gonna write everything in the world seems to be falling apart your kids are stretching you out maybe your home life is fish through out your job and everything but it's a comfort to you because you know that God has a body with you that he's with you and he promised that he would see you yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I won't be with you I will fear no evil because God is with you he's covered in you he's in the comfort is the comfort is that God has given you a revelation and that is your comfort there is no comfort outside of the word of God when you take your Bible and you open it up and you realize that you can see your name written in the pages of the scripture and then you know that God you were written in him before the foundation of the world or what greater comfort could there be than that but all the world begins to fall apart and you can you can look back into the scripture and know that you were with God before the foundation of the world in his mind they thought of you that he knew of you that is the greatest comfort that I could ever think that I could even imagine and he said I'll not leave you comfortless but I will come to you see he's not just sitting some other things but he's himself his own life coming in to dwell inside well outside of the believer I'll not leave you comfortless I will come to you who is that spirit then what is the Holy Ghost its Christ in you cautions 120 selling the comforter that's the Holy Spirit and when the comforter has come he will do the same things that I've done while the comforter is in me I'll pray the Father and he'll give you this comforter you know the comforter the world won't know it never will but you know him because he dwells now with you and how do you know it how do you know because he has revealed himself to you he's made himself known he's open up the word to you and he's speaking to you in a spiritual way a way that the world cannot understand because he's speaking words of comfort and affirmation to you just like he spoke to Moses at the burning bush I am the God of Abraham Isaac continue and there's another thing the Holy Ghost is mother of children at first John chapter 2 he says my little children these things write unto you that you send on they'll sing but now mister this is where it gets beautiful and if any man seen if you do sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous and he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world so when you do make mistakes remember that story the brother and talked about how he was looking judging it that woman sitting in there and that bar with us to meet and he was sitting there looking at look at that and God took him over he said come over here I want to talk to you for a minute and he took the mother behind the door and they begin to show him how there was a bump of blood over a bun all around the earth and every time that brought around anything wrong that that that God would kill them except that bumper blood it would just bounce right off of that because what the holy ghost is it is a it is an advocate with the father an advocate is like an eternity that speaks upon your behalf and if the attorney is the same one to sit behind the judgment seat that you can't lose let it down make anybody much you can't lose I see we get all tossed about because we make mistakes and we do things wrong goodness gracious y'all may win then one we'll finish up here in a minute so he says you sittin up don't see him but if you do skin you got somebody somebody down the inside you got that blood covering to represent you because that Jesus Christ is on the inside representing you back to the Father saying he didn't mean to do it he got deceived into that he got pulled off into that and God is there to be an advocate to you to be a propitiation for your sins and the profession is that he doubted he already died on the cross he died on the cross for that you'll have to he died on the cross so that you don't have to go to hell he is the propitiation he's the one that already paid the price for you he already paid everything for you and when you do anything wrong God is looking at that he's looking at that judgment already paid like that grass serpent and stand up in instead of what you've done he's not looking at you like brother have said all that he hears as your voice cried out to the Father for forgiveness he doesn't even cease for the blood all he does he just hears your voice coming out to it what does the only goes to sin advocate what is an applicator what does it do it makes that advocate it hasn't mercy it stands in your place it does things that you can't do because you you can't advocate yourself you can't represent yourself but he can represent you he can be your lawyer your attorney it's a propitiation for your sins it's your righteousness it's your healing it's your life it's your resurrection that's all that God has for you he's an advocate how we could go into details with that and bring that back around it makes intercession for our ignorance sometimes we got the Holy Ghost we can you atleast anger into something the Holy Spirit is there to make advocate for us he is applicator he stands he's our attorney he stands there and pleas for us we don't plead for ourselves because the Holy Ghost in us pleads for us the Holy Ghost giving an utterance sometimes the words you can't understand and he makes intercession for us that's what the Holy Ghost is that's what listen sometimes you get down and you begin to pray you better get to call out to God and you come to a place where something within you because to do the speaking on your behalf my Paul says making other others and groanings that you don't even realize what's being saying like that time the program said he will be begin to pray and he heard somebody speaking and he thought it was a German out in the hall when somebody speaking in another language but it turned out that it was his own voice calling out for that little sister that was in trouble there was the Holy Ghost in him crying out somebody the Holy Ghost funnier than you pity us to cry out listen when the Holy Ghost begins to call out for your family and it's not you something will begin to happen it's the Holy Ghost it's an advocate for you it's the Holy Ghost is that advocator for your church for your family and that's what the Holy Ghost is the most important thing and they're willing for the Holy Ghost then we just become the church out of a family out of just just come to church just to be here we need the Holy Ghost and I may interrupt there [Music] [Music] could be a hassle lower this morning so this morning I thought I would just kind of go through I went through the I was going through all the sermons that Bill Graham preached on what is the Holy Ghost and why was it given for everything with my kids we just kind of get together in the evenings and whatnot and they they really enjoyed it themselves I just kind of wondered do it little exercise a little background [Music] y'all just remember brother Wade in them and all the special needs everything we're going to explore especially that he yes I'm gonna feel good about you know ladies going today so that I guess they took him into the hospital and Saturday sometime Saturday he's I don't know if he have Jeff painter was that you can regulatory to the hospital and whose prayer yet and they did a heart cath Saturday afternoon and put a steel [Music] in fact let's just go to the Lord in prayer this morning Lord Jesus were so grateful together to be able to gather together around your word would you just once again and we pray O God that you'll give special grace to brother Louisa someone that sees pre-printed labels word the Lord y'all grin and I played on the children give them power or Jesus to speak whatever you lay upon his heart or not to hold back this morning when he's away it out there Morris Lord we ask Lord Jesus that you just be with all of the day before the river brother Claude I'm gonna wait and all the situation up there knowing where they are or what all the different needs of the people with Jesus and bigger that's one job because we know that you're you made us a needy people or that we hunger and cry for you the Lord Jesus and we need so many things from You Lord and you're here and able to deliver us and give us everything that we have need up Lord granted Lord as we look into your word Lord Jesus that you open it up to us to love God and cause us to see more about who we are who you are in the place in the hour that you've made for us to manifest your word today Lord grant authority just that you'll be with office alternator the services we ask in your name amen all right now what is the Holy Ghost court you know up as you kind of look into some things that brother Brennan said about what the Holy Ghost is you realized it that if it was not for the Holy Ghost then we would just be coming together to just kind of gather around like I could have done in Atlanta I worked they've got that big Christian science building this big monolith and I was walking over there and there that kind of get something to eat the other day and I saw they had the big sign that gets in Christian Science reading room and you see if it wasn't for the Holy Ghost we would just kind of be going together together have like a reading room and this is going to help us to read some quotes and just to kind of be I have an understanding just from from our intellectual standpoint what may be a good way to live and everything is but the gospel is about it's about more than just kind of a good moral system you just find kind of following people and just kind of come to church and gather together and being nice good citizens it's more than that and what makes it different what what makes it what it is is it is the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is the life of God actually moving in the church movement in his people it's the life of God himself and you think about what kind of grace it is for the god of glory the god of creation that created everything that we can see everything that it is that spoke the world into existence to be able to come down and abide in our flesh to be able to live in in us and allow us to take part in in preaching the gospel and witnessing to others and in the whole plan of redemption and so the Holy Ghost is the is the most important thing that there is it's more important than then choosing a spouse is more important than choosing a job it's more important than your job is more important than all the earthly pleasures all that all the things that makes this tactic is the most critical most important thing that there is and so I believe that we should if there's any doubt in your mind any doubt at all that whether you have the Holy Ghost or not you should lay aside and everything else and dig into the word dig into a little bit just lay aside everything else until you're sure that you have those because like I believe that you can know whether you have the Holy Ghost you can you know about I've heard just growing up you know different ministers and whatnot they get up and talk about how that the devil comes and battles them about whether they've got the and you know I believe that's true the devil can come and battle you and put off the thoughts and things in your mind but if the rebel if the baptism and Holy Ghost is a personal revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you then God can reveal to you he will reveal to you whether or not you have it or not and you can make it so real to you that it's that something that is like a rock that your whole life is ground little that you know that you know that you know that you are sealed away that it's the sign that you as a sign that others you've been sealed away even a signed sealed and delivered and there's nothing in the whole world can take that away from you when God gives you a revelation he can take somebody might be able to take away an emotion from your I might take away some some kind of little feeling or maybe that maybe you you've seen the pillar of fire so that somebody can make a reason that I weigh from you but if God gives you a personal revelation of who he is and nobody can give the gates of pain okay prevail against that and so let's let's uh I don't way set up I don't want to get the priest you'll see that okay and he says now I want to talk on it as the holy spirit being a sign so it's a real realm in the in the message what is that what is the only ever see he goes through all the different things that the Holy Ghost is and he does things about by one by one and the next message he talks about why was it given for so let's just take some of these things that will end and talk about it as the Holy Spirit being a sign for it is a sign we realize that all promises is given to us by Abraham was the father of the promise because God gave the promise to Abraham and to his seed after him the promise was made to Abraham into his seat and this son is to Epona people now there is a vast difference between just a Christian and a Holy Ghost filled Christian and now we're going to get this from the scripture and placing just exactly in the scripture the first place there is a Christian profess to be a Christian but if this Christian has not yet been filled with all the notes he's only in process of being a Christian see Peters profess to believe it he's working to it but God has not yet given him the spirit of the Holy Ghost he's not yet reached that goal with God that God has recognized me and now you see that's what brother brother they all have been talking about that that there's a process that you work through by by through faith by grace through faith are you safe because the Holy Ghost what it is is the Holy Ghost is drawing you through this process and there is an actual point where you get the baptism the Holy Ghost as you go through this process and the process begins with justification sanctification the baptism only goes and then it doesn't it doesn't end at that it just keeps growing and growing because the baptism and Holy Ghost as the river laid the revelation just keeps unfolding and as it keeps unfolding if it keeps ceiling in the it sails in virtue that seals in knowledge and temperance until until you come up all the way getting a little bit deeper maybe the identity but you come up all the way to receiving the message for your day which brings you back to them till that touken the baptized baptism in the holy ghost according to Malachi 4:5 6 which is a capstone baptism taking you all the way back until to God has completely taken over your being which will see brother branham gets into this he gets into this and walk back toward the end of the message he starts talking about how the the baptism of the Holy Ghost was given to completely take over the beings so that God can have complete preeminence in you but it's a process that you have to go through and he said the circumcision is a type of the Holy Ghost and God gave Abraham the circumcision signed after he accepted God on his promise and walked out into a strange country see it was a sudden and all his children and his seed after him should have this sign in this ended in the flesh because it was a distinction it was to separate them from all other peoples this sign of circumcision and that's what God uses today is the sign of circumcision of the heart the holy spirit that makes God's church a separated church from all other Creed's faiths and denominations now this is where it gets real clear that sickness in the Old Testament the sign was in your flesh and the man's flesh and in the New Testament the sign is in the man's heart and it's in the heart but it works its way our so you can see yes a sign to you but to others it's also a sign because people can look at you and you are assigned to them Europe like the Bible says that be salty don't be salty to one another when somebody sees you it makes seize your life that sign and manifests you're so salty that makes them thirsty to have the same thing that you do and becomes a sign to others that they know that there is a Living God because of the patience that you have of the temperance that you have of the virtue that when they talk to you strength flows out from you and there to receive strength and help and you don't just talk negative to improvise everything that you you speak of faith and you're able to to help people along their Christian journey and it becomes a sign and that's what brother said you let me talk to a man two minutes I can tell you whether you've received the Holy Ghost or not so can you my goodness what a statement and what way brother Branham can you tell that somebody has received the Holy Ghost how can you tell that now he didn't see doesn't spell this out so if you want if you want to give me some grace I'm just going to tell my revelation but the rent is the Holy Ghost if the baptism the Holy Ghost is a personal revelation to you then that revelation will work its way out and so you the way that you tell if somebody has the only ghost or not is give it the word test like brother I'm saying you lay the word of the measuring stick like through bubbles measuring line up to it and if the revelation that they have does not compare with a revelation of Scripture if they say well God is not God it's not still the same yesterday today and forever god still cannot hear all that line all the words and then you know something's wrong but you talk to somebody and out from there out from there barely out from them comes a wellspring of everlasting life and the faith that they have bears record with the same with the word that's written on the page and it matches up perfectly then you know that something has taken place in that believers life I can take you whether he's received all of us or not something you get separates them it's a mark it's the Son and the Holy Spirit is assignment that I'll stress on this to my kids and you can see if you told me somebody and they said well I know that I have the Holy Ghost because one day I got in the spirit and I felt a great big sensation which lets me be real honest we were watching videos of these little children testifying actually to a certain camp then I'm not gonna name just about every one of them they got up and they said well I know that something happened to me people thought I felt it I know that something happened to me because I felt a sensation I know I was in the I was in the atmosphere I was in I was in the atmosphere of just a lot of jumping around a lot of things you know Paul said bodily exercise profiteth a little and brother Brennan said the meaning of that bodily exercise profiteth little was was that just public exalted hopping around everything doesn't necessarily profit that much it's good and everything but what will profit you is to have a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you and that's how you know that you have been born again because God has revealed it to you and see that a revelation is different it's different than just an intellectual understanding that's different than the intellectual understanding that st. Augustine had where he studied the scriptures until he thought all the sudden what if they won't believe without this force them to believe it and begin to kill known as intellectual understanding that's different than people that just got to go to our seminary everything and they get an idea that that you need to be baptized in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost those those three that they don't have a revelation of what that is and that's so they just kind of skip stay stuck on that that then there's three there's three different gods but a revelation is God himself real feeling him to you and and that is what you can place everything up so I feel like we need to just keep hammering it because it's it's almost it's almost something that you can explain to people but then when you when God really reveals himself to you then you almost have an aha moment you look back and say oh that's what those ministers were talking about that's what they've been preached for all these years and maybe you know maybe this morning you might look back to your own life and realize with the data that God made him to call you began to deal with you he was he's revealing himself through justification he's revealing dealing we used to through sanctification because you can sanctify yourself is that God moving upon his word moving the point administering it ministering his word to you to produce a sanctified life in you and then he comes and puts his own soul inside of you and it becomes a revelation because the revealer is now inside of you and he's teaching your worries he's teaching you the word he's bringing he's bringing the word that he's that you've read that you've heard to your remembrance and he's tying it all together so you can have a perfect understanding of it and then it will produce works in your life it will produce the actual life of Christ in you and that's what he said here at in paragraph 47 when you are circumcised of the Holy Ghost it does the same thing to you it makes you do things that you didn't think you would do it makes you take God's promise and believe you God and so there's there's the evidence it makes you believe God when you got the baptism at all because you cannot help but believe God because the believer is inside of you that's Galatians 2:20 the life that I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God because he is inside of you doing the believing he is inside of you is his faith doing the work and I think that's another thing that so many of us stumble everybody think well well I've got to let go of this problem that I have I've got to let go of all these things I don't like to you know really struggle and everything but it's not you doing it it's Christ doing it inside of you it's Christ living on the inside of you it's him doing it and all you do is you just let go you're just open the door that allowed him to come in and and the only way that you can open the door is not by your own ideas but taking God at His Word and believing it and so that's why it's so important to get into the we'll get into the message and find out what do you really say find out what the holy ghost really is get to church have some money preach the true baptism but all that goes through the pulpit because if it's not if it's not taught correctly how can you get born again if you don't know what it is then how can you how can you be mourning even if you think it's just the motion of things then then that's what you'll be seeking if you think it's just look at it at lights or whatever or just just maybe even looking at a man I know that I'm born again somebody might say because my pastor is boring in all I know that I'm born again because my husband is born again that's not the way that the gospel works you must be born again for yourself you must receive the bathroom and all good for yourself and so I want to clarify too that when I say the baptism the Holy Ghost as for the parlor is a lesson I'm talking about the new birth because you can the program said you're gonna have the Baptist nobody was there every day of your life and die and go to hell and that confuses people also what do you mean that you can have advantages only those own you own you I think own your spirit you can have an anointing and that's that's what you see so many times that you know you can have an anointing on your spirit and a preacher can and and down from their soul they're not converted the revealer is not down on the inside of their soul and so when they get up behind the pulpit their preacher they're saying things a little bit off they're saying things taking you to another God taking you to something that that's not quite right because they have an annoyance the G when anointing of the baptism only goes its own their spirit and owning their life like Judas to cast out Devils to preach and to do all those things but down on the inside something has not been converted and you know you can tell when you get the new birth down on the inside of your soul there's a difference between the anointing on your spirit and that gene that's the germs see coming to life in your soul there's a difference now notice but in this EE ghost is a sign and I mean and the Holy Ghost is the seal so he talks about it's a sign and it's also a seal it's a sign that God gave to his chosen children to reject it is to be cut from the people and to receive it is to be finished with the world and all the things of the world and to be a product that God has put a seal of approval on so the seal means the seal means that he has accepted your faith you believe you believe you say see it's not it's not the moment that you believe but have you ever seen a little cinch to believe because you believe you keep believing and then he comes and says yes that is genuine faith and gene one faith is based upon the Word of God not just to pull man's ideas but when you come to a place where you genuinely believe in God comes and inspects it and looks you over and says yeah now the redemption the part of this little Redemption process like for your soul is complete and he comes and baptize you with the Holy Ghost become the seals you all seals off and so that's why as you keep growing up he's sealing you off he's expecting you to see why are you shaking a little bit loosen your paint chips and he comes in seals at all he said yeah this person is patience his patient he keeps stealing you off you've got godliness aspects your gives you a little bit of trials everything else really hi brother Branham said then he left Jesus Jesus just live for 30 years and then then all of a sudden it came time for 3 years of really hard trials and at the end of that really hard three years of trials of preaching that everything all just just constantly being hammered by the devil constantly people challenged him and all those things then then he could seal off this whole life on my Transfiguration to see that's the same thing that he does with you he's he's inspecting you constantly he's expecting you to see if you have these virtues in and to see if that real faith is made manifest in your life to see what what's there and he steals it and and it's sealed until the day of your redemption until the day that the whole process is completed that's what's the matter we don't get sealed so much so we're too loose about things when the inspector goes through to inspect your life to see if you're not just too loose about things little loose about your prayer life little loose about that temper little loose about that tongue to talk about others you'll never steal the caller he's talking about that box car that has to be inspected to make sure everything is tight and fastened down and then he puts the seal that cannot be broken until he reaches its destination look on that box car some dirty habits some vile things some vulgarity mind he can't seal the car but when he's found everything in this place the inspector then he seals it dary anybody opened that seal until that car has reached its destination to where it's sealed form there it is touch not my Nona do my prophets no harm for not saying you to be better for you and in keeping it goes on but see a seal is the Holy Ghost is a sign to you and to the world that you have been redeemed and it's a seal that everything that has been required you have met all of God's requirements and the requirement is that you believe God's work and when you believe God's Word he comes and seals it and that's why this token this token of the true baptism the Holy Ghost could not come until this day that requires full obedience to the word full obedience to the word how could that come until this day when we have all of the word when you have all the word that God could come and seal up your life because you have made ever you come to full of medians to all of the wording God seals your complete life amen this may contain if I kidding and and this is this is really good that's what that's what the Holy Spirit is it's your assurance it's your protection this your witness it's your seal it's your son they didn't that wonderful to have an assurance to have an assurance that God has paid the price for you you've accepted and he's given you the baptism the Holy Ghost as a son that he's accepted as a son that he's accepted you that he's is your assurance that that price has been paid as your token that you can wave at the game to say I got a pass I got a free pass that I can go through because the price has already been painted I know it you see why it's a revelation because when it's revealed to you it's revealed to you that you have an assurance it's your protection is your protection against the devil and all the things that the devil can throw against you and it's your ways it's your seal then I'm heaven bound don't care what the devil sense I'm heaven bound why he civilly gave it to me sealed me and it's Kingdom and I'm glory bound let the winds blow let Satan do what he wants to God has done sealed me till the day of my Redemption I said I like preaching only goes that you can know that you gotta die that always bothered me when I was growing up if your people say well you know sometimes a devil met the devil one mess for you the devil will mess with you he'll mess with you read about your healing and everything he'll try to try to get you to disbelieve that's the devil's job is to poke at you and prod and try to get you to doubt God's Word but if you've got the Holy Ghost if you get the revelation of Jesus Christ inside of you then that is a that is the thing that God has given you to withstand every fiery darts of the wicked one that is the thing that God has given you a rock down on the inside that the gates of Hell cannot prevail against and so I believe that when you get to the baptismal oligos god Kendrick will you that you got it and now the Spirit of God the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost it is the Spirit of Christ in you now before we read I just like to say if you come any word to what is the Holy Ghost is a seal it's a covenant it's a sign it's the spirit of Jesus Christ team you see a little while since Eva said the world sees me no more yet ye shall see me for I will be with you even in you to the end of the world ye shall see me because why when you come like in the Old Testament it says every every every donkey or whatever that come came forth through the matrix must be redeemed by Lamb when you come forth through that spiritual matrix your eyes become open to a new world and you begin to behold like a child coming forth for the first time you begin to look at the father you see the father you begin to realize that you did not come from your earthly mother and father but you came from above you were falling from above and that's why I says you the world does not see him anymore but when you're born again your eyes become open but listen that's what a lot of times when you begin to talk to somebody that is not born again the discussion almost becomes an argument and you have to watch yourselves because they cannot see what you can see they can't see they're not beholding the father's face with spiritual eyes but come listen when you get the new birth you have an act like the eye of your soul that is looking to a realm beyond the things that you can see with your next rise you're looking to the unseen you're looking with eyes for faith to see things that you cannot see with the natural eye and that's what the new birth it is when we say it's a revelation it's almost more than that word to even explain more than you can even comprehend just from that ball in an oven at Dover elation because of the revelation it means that when you are born again you can see like the holiday when Elijah said god I pray that you will open up his eyes and he looked around and all the angels all the angels were gathered around it's an S it's like you begin that's what brother Ed said when the seals begin to open up when the word begins telling went up to you you can look into the Bible with new eyes and see things that you never saw before because it's God revealing it to you and this is so different than an intellectual revelation is not an intellectual understanding do you have to see you have to understand you have to you have to receive it in your brain you have to read it for yourself but when God reveals it to you and elevates it beyond just something that you understand with your carnal mind it becomes a spiritual knowledge to you that nobody can take away then jesus said to them again in John chapter 20 peace be unto you as my father has sent me even so send I you attended programs that explains they said the Jesus that sins you goes with you and is in you and if that spirit living in Jesus Christ make him do and act the way he did you will have some general idea of how that'll do when it's in you because that life cannot change it will go from body to body but it cannot change his nature for it is God does he see God since God seems you and I the same way that he sent himself he didn't couldn't he didn't send somebody else to go down on the cross he came himself he put his old wife the life of Jesus Christ and walked to that cross himself that was God Almighty in that man that died on the cross and the same way that he sends you a night to preach the gospel to minister others to be helping others as he puts his life inside of you and he goes himself and that's how since that's how he sins and when he goes and lives inside of a believer it'll make the believer act the same way that it did when he was in Jesus Christ that's how you know what the Holy Ghost is John chapter 14 it says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater works than these shall you do because I go into my father either believeth on me and brother Tom kept explaining that he didn't believe that continues in that process I bleed from justification sanctification the new birth coming in and make you late in Christ and continue don't believeth believeth on me and if somebody you know falls away you it's proof that they never even started their journey correctly because once you start that journey correctly God it's God moving you and calling you and drawing you up and if it's God doing it he will see you to the end but whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that while I do that the father may be glorified in the son if he shall ask ask anything in my name I will do it let's talk about that for a little in my name when you had been a name of represents the characteristics of that thing like Adam and Eve in the garden adamant and in the garden he began to put a name to things he put a name to a parent because it marked something else they would just repeat other words he put a name to a sheep but it's a sheep because it at all warm and it had the nature of established of a lamb but when God puts God came and his name on him said the name of Jesus Christ represents that the nature and the characteristics of God himself were in that person and so when you become a Christian when you take on the name of Jesus Christ that means the life of that person the characteristics that make up that person is now living inside of you and so if you ask anything in my name in the name because you have baptized into him you're part of his life the characteristics of that person are now in manifesting themselves in you and us in his name of opponent revelation of who that person is I will do it cuz you're not asking based upon your own desires you're not asking based upon some kind of mental understanding or anything like that but you're asking based upon God's Word that you know that he promised it that and then you can ask for your kids because you know that the promises that as many as are far off you can ask it believe me you can ask believing and calling out to God that he will come and draw your children just like he drew you [Music]
