[0:00] have a tube or crystal that picks up
[0:02] these either ways and manifest them. So
[0:05] you see right in this building now is
[0:08] live actions of people in the air, live
[0:11] voices. They're here. We know it.
[0:13] They're absolutely the truth. And the
[0:15] only thing you do, they catch it on. I
[0:19] don't understand the mechanics of those
[0:22] things, but the science has invented.
[0:24] But we know that it proves to us that
[0:27] there is a fourth dimension.
[0:46] Now the fifth dimension he says uh now
[0:48] the fifth dimension is where the sinner
[0:49] the unbeliever dies and goes he goes to
[0:53] the fifth dimension. It's a kind of a
[0:56] well hor horrible
[1:05] dimension. He said in in the countdown
[1:07] he said if I would type it for you it's
[1:09] like trying to go to sleep and you're in
[1:12] can't be asleep and you're in in a
[1:15] nightmare. You hide his thing. You're
[1:18] screaming. You're just all that's the
[1:20] state of the wicked dead. He cannot go
[1:23] into the presence of God because he he
[1:25] is a sinner. He cannot return back to
[1:28] earth because his time is up and he's
[1:31] caught between the two things in the
[1:34] fifth dimensions. He's got a soul and he
[1:37] cannot go in the presence presence of
[1:40] God because it's not
[1:43] covered by the blood. He he's a
[1:46] sinner. He cannot wake himself up
[1:49] because his time is up on earth. So
[1:52] there he is in torment nightmare. Think
[1:55] of that now before you enter it at
[1:58] nightmare scream. Many of us had had
[2:00] nightmares. It's just because we're told
[2:03] because the two conscious are passing
[2:06] sub and first conscious and it catches
[2:09] between and that's the nightmare. And
[2:11] when a sinner dies, he's caught with his
[2:15] soul between earth and hell in a
[2:18] nightmare. There he stands.
[2:21] Have you ever had a dream? I had dreams
[2:24] before that, you know, like a nightmare
[2:26] or something and you try to wake up and
[2:28] you can't wake up and you scream. You
[2:31] thought you woke everybody up and it's
[2:34] not, you know, it's it's a horrible, you
[2:36] know. So, we all have dreams, I guess.
[2:49] A lot of people in the Bible have had
[2:51] dreams even just uh ordinary people uh
[2:54] when they had uh Jesus that had taught
[2:57] us all.
[2:59] Matthew
[3:01] 27:19 he said when he sat down the
[3:04] judgment seat his wife sent unto him
[3:07] saying have thou not nothing to do with
[3:10] a just man for I have suffered many
[3:12] things this day in that dream because of
[3:15] him that's pilot
[3:23] wife Matthew
[3:26] 120 but while he thought of these
[3:28] things. Behold, the angel of the Lord
[3:30] appeared unto him in a dream, saying,
[3:33] Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to
[3:37] take unto thee, Mary, thy wife, for that
[3:39] which is conceived in her is of the Holy
[3:42] Ghost.
[3:47] First Kings
[3:49] 3:5 in Gib Gibian the Lord appeared to
[3:52] Solomon in a dream by night and God said
[3:56] that's what I shall give thee that's
[3:59] when thou so asked for wisdom
[4:03] in Job
[4:05] 33:15 in a dream in a vision of the
[4:08] night when deep sleep fall upon men and
[4:11] slumberings upon the Hey,
[4:52] The message exploits our faith. Brother
[4:54] says that's when Billy Paul was in was
[4:56] hospitalized. He says said, "I remember
[4:58] not long ago when my boy struck a habit
[5:00] that he ought not to have had many young
[5:04] some boy young boys and kept telling
[5:06] him. God had warned him. He almost got
[5:09] killed." Then he showed me on one one
[5:12] night in a vision. He said, "Watch
[5:15] Billy. Watch Billy." And I seen him fall
[5:18] and just limb over limb over limb over
[5:22] limb going like that, falling to the
[5:24] ground. And I thought and I screamed,
[5:26] "Oh God, have mercy on my boy. It's the
[5:29] only boy I have. Lord, don't let him die
[5:32] like that." And he was going falling
[5:34] through space like that. And when I came
[5:37] to myself in the vision, I was standing
[5:39] in the room screaming. I thought, "Oh
[5:42] my, did I wake my wife up?" Look around.
[5:45] No. I thought, "Oh
[5:47] my." I got down and began to pray. Look,
[5:51] Brad said in front of me. I thought, "Oh
[5:53] my god, don't let my boy be killed like
[5:55] that." That's what I was talking about.
[5:57] When you have dreams, sometimes you
[5:59] can't try to wake up and you can't wake
[6:01] up.
[6:16] and the message souls that are in
[6:17] prison. program
[6:19] says this is a vision at age when the
[6:23] vision at age 14 when the hospital after
[6:25] being shot in a hunting accident after
[6:28] the vision struck me I was so weak I
[6:30] lost all that blood and I thought I was
[6:33] sinking into an endless eternity many of
[6:35] you have heard me tell this before
[6:38] sinking into endless eternity and then
[6:41] what a different it was from the vision
[6:43] I had here not long ago of being in
[6:46] glory with the people contrast Yes. But
[6:48] in this I was falling. I finally I
[6:51] screamed for my
[6:52] daddy. Of course, being just a kid,
[6:54] that's what I would do. I screamed for
[6:56] my daddy and my daddy wasn't there. I
[6:59] screamed for my
[7:02] mother. Somebody catch me. And there was
[7:04] no no mother there. I was just going. I
[7:07] screamed then to God. And there was no
[7:09] God there. There was nothing there.
[7:12] After a while, I heard the most mournful
[7:14] sound that I ever heard. It was the
[7:16] awfulest feeling that there's no way
[7:18] even a litter and burning fire away at
[7:21] present be a pleasure to the sight of
[7:25] what it was. Now those visions had never
[7:28] been wrong and it was just one of the
[7:30] most horrible feelings I ever had. I
[7:33] heard a voice and sounded like some kind
[7:35] of a haunted
[7:36] affair and when it was I looked coming
[7:39] at me it was women. Sorry.
[7:49] Why is that so funny?
[8:02] Sorry. And they had green stuff. Oh,
[8:04] look at you guys don't have it. So
[8:06] that's good.
[8:11] And they had green stuff. You could see
[8:12] their faces. They had green stuff on
[8:14] their eyes and their and and their eyes
[8:17] look like ran ran back like the women
[8:19] today. They paint their eyes ran back
[8:21] like that and just their eyes and their
[8:24] face. And they were going,
[8:26] "Oh, oh my." I screamed out, "Oh God,
[8:29] have mercy upon me. Have mercy. Oh God,
[8:32] where are you? If you only let me go
[8:34] back, I'll live. I promise you to be a
[8:37] good boy." Now that's the only thing I
[8:39] could say. Now God knows and at the day
[8:42] of judgment he will judge me for this
[8:44] statement. That's what I said. Lord God
[8:47] let me go back and I will promise you I
[8:49] will be a good boy. Oh what a feeling.
[8:53] Then in a moment's time I have come back
[8:55] to natural life.
[9:23] Now he went beyond the curtain of time.
[9:24] That's what brother said. He said I
[9:26] think I've been to both both
[9:28] places. He
[9:30] said and the voice this is uh beyond the
[9:33] curtain of time. He says the voice asked
[9:36] would you like to see just beyond the
[9:37] curtain? I answered it would help me so
[9:39] much. What happened? I cannot say
[9:42] whether I was in the body or whether it
[9:45] was a translation I do not know but it
[9:47] was unlike any vision I have ever had. I
[9:51] could see the place to which I was taken
[9:54] and I could see myself lying back there
[9:56] upon my bed. I said this is strange.
[9:59] There were great numbers of people and
[10:01] they came running to me crying. Our
[10:04] precious brother. First came young women
[10:06] apparently in the early 20s. And as they
[10:09] would embrace me, they said, "Our
[10:11] precious brother." Young men that
[10:13] brilliance of young manhood with eyes
[10:16] blistering like stars on a darkened
[10:18] night with teeth as white as pearls.
[10:21] Embraced me saying, "Our precious
[10:23] brother." Then I noticed that I too had
[10:25] become young again. And I looked at
[10:27] myself there and turned and looked back
[10:29] at my old bed lying on the body lying on
[10:32] the bed with my hands behind my head and
[10:34] I said I don't understand this. As I
[10:37] began to try to apprehend comprehend the
[10:39] place where I was, I began to realize
[10:42] that there was no yesterday and no
[10:46] tomorrow. There no one seemed to be get
[10:49] tired as a multitude of the most
[10:52] beautiful young women I ever seen threw
[10:54] their arms around me and I discovered
[10:56] there was only a great love that
[10:59] overwhelmed me and no physical
[11:01] attraction as in a
[11:03] human human behavior. I noticed these
[11:06] young women all wore their hair down to
[11:09] their waistline and their skirts went
[11:11] down to their feet. After this hope, my
[11:14] first wife hugged me and said, "My
[11:16] precious brother." Then another young
[11:19] woman hugged me and Pope turned and
[11:22] hugged the young woman. I said, "I don't
[11:24] understand this. This is something
[11:26] entirely different from our human love.
[11:29] I don't want to go back to their old
[11:31] body on the bed." And that voice spoke
[11:34] to me. This is what you preached that
[11:37] the Holy Ghost is perfect love. Nothing
[11:39] can enter here without it. Next, I was
[11:43] taken up and seated in a high
[11:46] place. All around me were great numbers
[11:48] of men and women in the bloom of their
[11:51] youth. They were crying with joy. My
[11:53] precious brother, you are so happy to
[11:55] see you here. I thought I'm not. He
[11:58] said, I'm not dreaming for I can see
[12:00] these people and I can see my body lying
[12:03] back there on the bed.
[12:05] The voice spoke to me. You know it is
[12:06] written in the Bible that the prophets
[12:08] were gathered with their people. I said,
[12:11] "Yes, I remember that in the scripture,
[12:13] but there are not this many randoms."
[12:16] The voice replied, "These are not
[12:18] random. They're your comforts, the ones
[12:20] you have led to the Lord. Some of these
[12:22] women you think are so young and
[12:24] beautiful or more than 90 years old when
[12:27] you led them to the Lord." No wonder
[12:29] they're crying out, "My precious
[12:31] brother." Then the multitude cried
[12:33] together, "If you hadn't gone forth for
[12:36] the gospel, we wouldn't be
[12:39] here." And I asked, "Oh, where is Jesus?
[12:42] I want to see him." The people reply,
[12:45] "He just a little higher." He goes to
[12:48] the sixth dimension and God's in the
[12:50] seventh
[12:52] dimension. Someday he'll come to you.
[12:55] You are sent as a leader. And when God
[12:57] comes, he will judge you according to
[12:58] his you teaching. I asked does Paul and
[13:02] Peter have to stand the judgment also?
[13:04] The answer said yes. I said I preached
[13:08] what they preached and I did not divert
[13:10] from it to one side or the other. When
[13:13] they baptized in the name of Jesus, I
[13:15] did too. Whe they taught the baptism of
[13:18] the Holy Spirit, I did too. Whatever
[13:20] they taught, I taught
[13:24] also. I like this way. He
[13:27] says, "I'm more convinced than ever in
[13:30] my life that it will take perfect love
[13:33] to enter that place. There was no
[13:35] jealousy, no tiredness, no sickness, no
[13:38] old age, no death, only supreme beauty
[13:42] and joy." He said, "Whatever you do, lay
[13:45] aside
[13:46] everything until you get perfect love."
[13:49] Right? Get to where you can love
[13:51] everybody, even every enemy. Right?
[13:54] Uhoh.
[13:56] No matter if the plane is rocking, the
[13:58] lightning is flashing, or the guns of
[14:00] the enemy are upon you, these things do
[14:02] not matter. Get
[14:19] perfect. This is one of the visions he
[14:22] had. I started his church age. He says,
[14:24] "I remember Tulsa, Oklahoma. I was
[14:27] getting an awful mess. Then the
[14:29] denominator began swinging around here
[14:31] and I was sitting in the this building
[14:33] one day and I seen a vision. I seen a
[14:37] pretty little kitten and he was laying
[14:39] on a silk pillow and he was the cutest
[14:42] little fellow and walked over there and
[14:44] I'm afraid of a I'm afraid of a cat."
[14:47] And I went over and I began to rake him
[14:49] and he was
[14:51] going, "You know how they do? They make
[14:53] a funny noise, you know." And I was
[14:56] raking him and I said, "Pretty little
[14:58] kitten." And he said, "Just as fine as
[15:00] you know." And I looked over behind
[15:03] Phil. It said Pentecostal kitten. Well,
[15:06] I thought now isn't that strange. And I
[15:08] said, "This has got to be a vision." And
[15:12] something said as as long as you rake
[15:15] him his fur this way. All right. But now
[15:18] you want to see what he's made out of
[15:21] rake
[15:22] his rake his fur backwards. See what
[15:26] when I rake his fur back and his eyes
[15:28] stuck up green. And he was a monster
[15:31] standing there spitting at me as hard as
[15:34] he could. See just rake his fur back a
[15:37] little bit. Tell him his baptism is not
[15:40] father, son, and holy ghost. It's of the
[15:42] devil and the Catholic church. Watch
[15:44] what happens to him. See, it stirs up.
[15:47] It stirs them up.
[16:03] the message uh paradox said it was about
[16:07] 3:00 in the morning. I was supposed I
[16:09] had gotten up and I looked where in
[16:11] front of me and I was coming down to the
[16:13] to to Jordan looked like I was standing
[16:16] on the map of Palestine. I was coming
[16:19] down to Jordan and it seemed like I
[16:21] could hear the song I'm going down to
[16:24] Jordan. Someone was singing it. And as I
[16:27] drew near the river, I looked back and
[16:29] seen which way I had come. And I was 2/3
[16:32] of the way there to Jordan. And I looked
[16:35] across Jordan. I said, "Oh, praise God."
[16:38] Just on the other side is where all that
[16:40] promises lay. Every promise lays in the
[16:43] promised land. And then I came to myself
[16:46] and I thought, could I have possibly
[16:49] have could I have been that I was
[16:51] dreaming? It's night time. See, you see
[16:54] it. A vision is something that you see
[16:57] with your eyes open just like a dream.
[17:00] You're looking right at it and you're
[17:02] conscious that you're standing like here
[17:04] on a platform and you're you're standing
[17:07] here, but yet you look like you're in a
[17:09] dream. You can't explain it. There's no
[17:11] way to do it. See, it's God's words and
[17:15] God's ways are unexplainable. They have
[17:18] to be accepted by faith.
[17:25] Joe, excuse me. What book was that in
[17:27] that quote? This one? Yeah. Paradox. No,
[17:31] I mean what the title of the message?
[17:34] Paradise. What book is it in? Paradox.
[17:37] Oh, Paradox. Okay. You like that? I
[17:41] didn't
[18:00] Ryan was asking questions at the last
[18:02] last Saturday on
[18:04] the the Bible study about the bumper
[18:07] blood. Jehovah
[18:10] Jar. We said the blood of Jesus is a
[18:12] bumper to sin.
[18:15] He said, "I went up I went up walked
[18:18] down the road a little piece and went to
[18:20] in an ordinary little restaurant like
[18:23] road place and and when I walked in
[18:25] behind the door, the door shut behind me
[18:30] real hard and I looked and there stood a
[18:32] policeman with his arms around a woman
[18:35] playing a slot machine. Gambling is
[18:37] illegal in Ohio. And I thought the law,
[18:41] the very law, and the man was my age,
[18:44] perhaps married and had a family at
[18:46] home. I thought, "Oh my corruption,
[18:49] filth." I looked back at the table back
[18:52] there and some young boys and a lady,
[18:54] little young lady about 18, 20, 20 years
[18:58] old. They ought to have been in school,
[19:00] Sunday school somewhere. those boys
[19:03] drinking back there and all the way they
[19:05] were abusing that girl and her standing
[19:08] there letting them do it. And I happened
[19:12] and I happened to look over to my right
[19:14] and there was an ear elderly woman
[19:17] sitting there with little clothes on
[19:19] that she ought to have had on. Real old
[19:23] about 65, maybe better. And she had
[19:26] purple makeup on her mouth and on her
[19:29] toenails and her arms.
[19:32] Poor old thing was flabbing. Her hair
[19:34] was boys lobbed in little kinky curls up
[19:37] on it. She was trying to light a
[19:39] cigarette drunk and two drunken men with
[19:42] her. And I thought, "Oh god, how can you
[19:44] let How can you look at such as that?" I
[19:49] thought my little Sarah and her back are
[19:51] going to have to be raised up in a world
[19:54] like that. He said, "God, why don't you
[19:57] just destroy the thing? Take it all out.
[20:00] I don't see how you can stand it to look
[20:03] at as such a thing as that. I was
[20:06] standing there criticizing her. The two
[20:08] drunks with her got up and went out to
[20:10] to be gone just for a while. And just
[20:13] then I felt something moving on me and I
[20:16] went back and sat down at the little
[20:17] booth to the side. Nobody paid any
[20:20] attention to me yet. It was kind of dark
[20:22] in the corner and there God gave me a
[20:25] vision and changed my mind uh of things.
[20:29] I looked there and I saw a world and
[20:31] around the world was
[20:33] u what looked like a red streak just to
[20:36] spray something said this is the blood
[20:38] of the Lord Jesus would die to save
[20:42] sinners that's a reason that God can't
[20:46] destroy he can't see her he can't every
[20:50] mortal being has a right and has a right
[20:53] to accept their salvation until they die
[20:56] and go beyond that blood they don't have
[20:59] to stand in judgment. They already
[21:01] judged. The day you eat thereof, that
[21:03] day you die. But as long as you're here,
[21:07] you got a right to the tree of life if
[21:09] you accept it. Then I looked and above
[21:12] it. There stood the Lord Jesus in a
[21:15] vision. And I seen him with his thorns
[21:17] on his head and blood running down his
[21:19] face and a big mockery spit over his
[21:23] precious beard. And he was jerking his
[21:26] head like that. every once in a while
[21:28] jumping at that I thought what is that
[21:32] what is that my lord and he said that's
[21:34] your
[21:35] sins and I seen that the blood of Jesus
[21:39] to my own sins was acting like a
[21:42] bumper if it would went beyond that
[21:45] stream of blood that was around the
[21:48] earth when he died to to settle the
[21:51] sins sins question if Putin went beyond
[21:55] that then God would have killed me. But
[21:58] just like the bumper to the car to keep
[22:00] your car from being hurt, the bumper
[22:02] catches the lick and the blood of that
[22:04] Jesus catches your sins. He said,
[22:07] "Father, forgive me. They don't know
[22:09] what they're doing. Father, forgive
[22:12] them." And I looked there, there my name
[22:15] laying there in an old book written like
[22:18] all kinds of things
[22:20] condemned. I crawled up to the his feet
[22:22] and said, "Lord Jesus, will you forgive
[22:25] me then? I didn't mean. I said, "You
[22:27] mean my sins hurt you like that?" He
[22:30] said,
[22:31] "Yes." He took his hand and dipped it in
[22:33] his side, took his finger and wrote
[22:36] across the book,
[22:38] "Pardon." Put it back behind him like
[22:42] that. Put his arms together and looked
[22:45] at me. He said, "I forgive you, didn't
[22:48] I?" I said, "Yes, Lord. I love you for
[22:52] it." He said, "But what are you
[22:54] condemning her?"
[22:57] Then you're willing to condemn someone
[22:59] else, but you look you was condemned
[23:02] once yourself and freely he pardon you.
[23:05] That changed my motive. Soon as I got in
[23:07] the vision, I walked over there to her
[23:09] and I said, "Madam, could I talk to you
[23:12] for a minute?" She said, "Oh, I have
[23:14] company." I said, "I don't mean it that
[23:16] way, lady. I'm a minister of the gospel.
[23:18] I want to talk to you." She took her
[23:20] cigarette down. She said, "Yes, sir."
[23:22] And I said, "Why are you living like
[23:23] this?" I said, "I don't really enjoy
[23:27] this. Are you a mother?" She said, "Yes,
[23:30] sir." And she gave me her story and it
[23:33] was heartbroken story, a picture of
[23:36] life other side, disappointment, same
[23:38] thing. She said, "Sir, I was raised a
[23:41] Christian. I was raised in a Christian
[23:42] home." I told her what the Lord Jesus
[23:46] rebuke me for condemning her and I
[23:48] wanted her to blow up or something like
[23:51] that. I said lady I want to ask you will
[23:54] you forgive
[23:55] me for having such thoughts about you?
[23:58] She said certainly son. She said will
[24:01] you pray for me that I will be saved? I
[24:04] said I will. Will you kneel down here?
[24:07] She said I will. We turned that place
[24:09] into a prayer meeting. That's right. The
[24:12] woman got saved, God. See, God will
[24:16] provide. One, he God will provide. He
[24:20] has already provided a way of escape for
[24:22] every one of us. I thought that was
[24:38] good. Yeah. Like I said, when I when I
[24:41] was a kid, we used to we grew up
[24:43] watching Frankenstein and werewolf
[24:46] and Dracula and
[24:50] uh Frankenstein didn't bother him. Just
[24:52] big old guy knocking stuff off and
[24:55] werewolves just wear all that get all
[24:57] that hair on him. But Dracula, I used to
[24:59] have nightmares and I told my mom, "If I
[25:01] ever die and you bury me, put a cross on
[25:05] on the coffin." You
[25:07] know, I used to really be scared of it.
[25:10] That's why when when go brother way and
[25:12] then late at night they want to eat
[25:14] steaks. I tell them no, I can't I can't
[25:16] eat steaks cuz I have a truck that try
[25:19] to bite me at night.
[25:21] But then then when I grew up, I did the
[25:23] same thing. You know, uh kids used to
[25:26] come in on on Halloween and I used to
[25:29] dress up at Dra as Dracula and then
[25:31] chase the kids down the street. So, I
[25:32] guess I should
[25:36] talk. Okay. I'm going to be a nice guy.
[25:38] Make sure you guys cover that.
[25:42] I was going to
[25:44] cover uh Joseph, but Joseph Joseph was
[25:47] uh he was the biggest dreamer in the
[25:49] Bible. There'd be a whole uh Sunday
[25:52] school class just on that. So, Timothy
[25:54] and I were were studying on that. We
[25:56] went to the to the camp when they took
[25:58] the kids to the camp. So, we really had
[26:00] good time. So,
[26:02] There's a lot of stuff in there.
