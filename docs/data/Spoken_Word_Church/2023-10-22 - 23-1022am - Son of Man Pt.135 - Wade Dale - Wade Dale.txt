something years old he's got all these uh what they call it now comorbidities and they got all these things going on and because he's 92 and he's F you know the old engines running out I didn't bother brother random he said brother Bill he said I'll shake your hand at the Tabernacle he wasn't looking at 92 years old he was looking at a promise and a vision that God had give him so let's just continue to believe that for brother Dale with all the things that are going on God can't even see that remember brother Brown said he hears our voice what through the blood so maybe we can throw some throw some prayers up there brother John and and touch God for our for our brother so I love you with the love of the Lord thank you all for coming back today and just uh keep praying for uh for the

thank you for this time you give us one more to stand before the greatest group of people on the face of the Earth let going to see something being fulfilled Lord from the scripture and from The Prophet's message even in our life of 63 years we've seen things happen Lord that the prophet told us was going to happen and they're here with Israel and all the different things going on Lord but without us they can't be made perfect so Lord help us to come to Perfection Lord so we can get out of the way and you can go and deal with with the Jews Lord through the two Prophets and Lord we'll be in glory having a Hallelujah Time Lord it'll all be over and done we'll be at the marriage supper because it'll be just for the bride and the family Lord I pray that you'd be with us now in the furth of this service just touch dad Lord and be with him give the nurses and doctors and whoever's there Lord the the wherewith all to do what they can do Lord and help them Lord make the right decisions and do the right things Lord because we believe in doctors we believe in nurses and hospitals and all that Lord but we know one thing for sure not one of them since the dawn of time has ever healed anybody Lord You Are the Healer amen you are the one that are will take a bone and put it right back together and Lord I pray that you just be with now the ones that are sick that are not with us today bless them Lord and just take care of them bring them back together Lord in service father just be with each one be with the uh youth again as they're all coming back from bethle Camp Lord and and thank God for the for the um testimonies that's already went before they even got here the testimonies of ones that are being delivered father we sure know you're a delivering God you're a healing God and you're a saving God you haven't stopped that not until we get out of here as Gentiles you will not stop and Lord I pray that you touch us here in this building today be with us in this service you speak the words Lord don't be a a participant on the sidelines Lord you be the active one in this service father just bless each one in Jesus name amen as we always read for 136 times in the beginning was the word is brother Brown I was reading a quote here just back there a minute where he said let's break this down he said in the beginning was the logos the logos was with God and the logos was God it's all God there's not three or four people running around up there uhuh no it's a furtherment of God it's God stepping out so that he can reveal he don't need to reveal himself to us I mean to him he needs to reveal himself to us you all right we we're the ones he knows who he is we just got to you know figure out who he is and he's given us everything we need to know it all right because because I believe that God's perfect I know you do too and he didn't write something down and then say well I think we need to do something different no he wrote it the way it was supposed to be it never will change so so if it's hard for you then you need to get the Holy Ghost you need to study you need to do a little more because it's written for our admonition as the Bible says it's written for us so somebody's going to get it he wrote it so we can get it all right so it's pretty plain that in the beginning was somebody was the word the logos the word was with God and the Word was God and that logos became flesh he had to come down here to save us and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten the father full of grace and truth Jesus wasn't part he was the fullness of God you may be seated in the Lord as his Blessing I'll read a few more of these this morning we kind of background a little bit so we're going to jump through the background a little bit and then we'll head into um talking about adoption because adoption is our predetermined uh destination in the end time without adopted Sons and Daughters of God there will not be a res Resurrection right death's got to be destroyed here yes by a baby no by an adult by a by a bride that has become a wife and knows what her husband wants amen yes get scary sometimes but but I know Mom and Dad's been married 60 something 65 years and June and I've been married 44 years and I know some of you may be longer than that but it's real scary when you look at each other and say something and you're like I was thinking the same thing I know it happens all the time well it ought to be with God too it ought to be what your thoughts are he's like I already thought of that that's good thought well that's a that's a wife the wife has made herself ready and that's what we're doing now we're getting ready now it's just not going to be all dumped on us cuz we couldn't take it we could not take it as human beings and you know what God knew that amen he knew that we couldn't dump it on he couldn't dump it on top of us and either make us do it no he can present it and let us make a choice and how much greater that is that we make the choice and he says that's my child that's my that's my wife right and present us to the world and that's what he done I believe through the prophet he was able to present us now because if you talk to people in denominations it's like they push everything you know well we know he died on the cross and we know there was a day of Pentecost but he lives inside of me but but I still smoke and drink and cuss and you know I'm no ain't nobody perfect you ain't perfect and I ain't perfect I've heard that a hundred times I just take him right back to the Bible and I said the Bible says be therefore perfect and he said I would be spot without spot or wrinkle he said I was righteous because of him so but they're waiting till we get it over there yeah yeah just one day and and every denomination believes you got to stand before judgment now I'm talking about the white Throne judgment no way no that's what I said I praise God almost every day that I think about I think God I don't have to stand judgment like these people have to stand judgment and you're the one that told me I didn't have to stand it through a prophet because all other denomination say oh yeah you're going to have seven years tribulation if you miss a Rapture you'll get a second one you know that what is that um Left Behind movie was you know if you don't make it the first time you can get better and make it the next time there ain't none of that we know that all right we get right now and brother Brown said whatever way the tree leans the Bible says that's the way it's going to fall he said death doesn't change your personality he said it just changes your Dwelling Place all right so if you hate people over here how you going to take hate over there come on somebody how you going to take it over there all right if you're vile over here how you going to take vness over there or you may take it over there but it ain't the over there that we're going to amen there's a there's a difference in a fifth and a sixth dimension I I know we know that don't make the fifth one okay we want to be in the sixth Dimension if we pass from this world I've always said you know they all those jihadist over there and Hamas and all that are are the ones that are Islamic you know they they say that if they die in martyrdom that they get 72 virgins I don't know how why they come up with that number but they get 70 something virgins and they get all this you know Euphoria and all this after they die if they die jihadis about that much after they pull that red or M that red button they figure out they got told a lie they got told a lie cuz they ain't going to meet no 72 virgins they might be 72 about 72 million people in that Fifth Dimension waiting on you know the Lord to come back and U and stand before the white Throne judgment but they ain't going to have they going it's not going to be blessed I'll promise you that but you know what that but see that's what they've been taught and listen they give their life for that they stood and give their life they mashed that button knowing that they was going to be in a Oasis with 72 virgins and they were going to I don't know how them 72 virgins got over there I'm just honest if they you know five or 6 hundred of them got killed last couple weeks just saying you see how you say well that sounds stupid but they believed it so much so they mashh the red button would you R mash the red button for religion right thank God we don't have to we just need to mash play and steady that's the only button we need to mash all right John 16 says when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all truth I was looking and I can't find it maybe if I ever say this I'm kind of what I do is is subliminally I can't find a quote but brother Joe's back there in the back and he's over there and he'll hand it to me at the end of the service so brother Joe I can't find this quote but uh it's a secret thing we have which is not secret anymore but uh if you look you know as well as I do you swear brother Brown said this the same identical way and you put it in and it ain't there it comes up zeros all right it comes up zeros but brother Randon was talking about the the ministry bring taking the big nuggets and bringing them down and breaking them down into small nuggets look up nuggets cuz I I was looking for and you can't find it but I know brother Brown was talking about a group of people that was going to break down what he said and give it to the people so maybe you can find it by the end of the service he may find it just a few minutes but I just couldn't get the word right and um but so he's going to guide you into all truth so what's my point there's going to be a people a fivefold Ministry that preaches the truth not a truth everybody with me it might be okay to preach a truth back in the other Church ages but in this church age like I said before Jesus never said one day never one day in his life on this Earth he never said I didn't do what my father said he said I always do that which the father shows me why can't we we got that same person inside of us amen the same man that said that's inside of you today by the Holy Ghost so why can't we keep it straight why can't we have a ministry that's perfect because a perfect ministry will produce a perfect people an imperfect ministry will produce a imperfect people come on brother R said if one word got him out of the garden being off one word one word right he said one word ain't going to get us back in either one word off so we've got to have this thing down right so I contend that if we'll let the Holy Spirit the truth the spirit of Truth he will guide you into all truth he will guide you into what to do where to go and what to listen to amen all right I just contend that he's perfect coming from a perfect one and that perfect one's inside of you now where's the mix up it's that Spirit realm we were talking about this morning where you get involved and I get involved he say the spirit of way Dale has come he said the spirit of Truth has come and then he the Holy Ghost will guide you into all that truth all right everybody with me CU he's not going to speak of himself in other words he's going to speak through his bride and we're all under the messenger of the age absolutely but Jesus Christ is my savior yes he's my head that I'm watching to come back I hope he's same way with you and you'll have it straight cuz when that Capstone when we ever get to that where it says love we'll see that those Seven Seals was given to bring the headstone which is Christ himself back to the Earth in a perfect message they can say whatever they want to about brother brandom and his personal life and whatever they he made this and made that and the other if brother bam ever made a mistake he told us that was one thing that man could do and I praise God that he couldn't keep a secret cuz he told us one time he said I can't keep a secret well praise God if he'd kept secrets we wouldn't have known what we know but he was sent here to give us a message all right and present it to us and then that Spirit of Truth which is the Holy Ghost is supposed to what now look the Holy Spirit don't coincide with the message the message coincides with the holy spirit because the holy spirit is the truth everybody with me but when they the two come together and they vulcanize when they vulcanize you can't pull it apart and you can't tell the difference that's right listen I can see now Sister C and different ones that sitting in our congregation saw brother brandham literally with their eyes they they sit in the meetings and they watched the meetings if you hung around that man long enough you just about think he was Jesus Christ I said You' just about think he was how the other ones thought you know baptizing in his name I mean that's hogwash and baloney but still a man that would tell you say hey you need to go hunt over there because I saw there's 20 elk over there in this side of the mountain and not over on this side then he tell you what you thought yesterday what you was eating and what your wife was doing yesterday well I mean what would you think and it all come through you you'd be going man but he was human he was a human mortal man and as brother Dell's always said we're a balanced church we don't go way over here in fanaticism and we going go over here in Greasy Grace we pull it all back together all right if the prophet of God said said he had a television then I mean not television but a Christmas tree then you can't quote me that he didn't but don't say anything about the ones that don't have one the ones that do that's what Daddy's always said right I mean so if you want to have one you got quotes for it so you got quotes for everything it's what's inside of you is what makes the difference cuz that Spirit of Truth is going to tell you how to deal with that right and he will show you things to come in other words give you Revelation yeah all right he will give you Revelation and brother Brown tells us in the church age book that the bride in other words we thrive on Revelation we need Revelation Revelation actually is what makes you stronger right amen the brother R says you're still what you are until you actually are born again of the spirit of God in other words all this other stuff doesn't change you your Creed joining your church change your ideas or you even your good intentions although as good as that might seem it's still not right there's something got to happen the new birth is an experience something that takes place all right then brother R talks he comes into the church age book now we're I mean the seal book we're going to take that in just a few minutes and I'm going to tell you give you a little story and we we we did it not too long ago we'll bring it back together now look this is on the first seal right here the first Seal's open he sees that there's something mysterious going on he sees that it's not exactly what he thought it was come on he said I'd have made a horrible mistake I told you I'd have made a horrible mistake if I had you know used my old notes he said the angel come in the room and correcting me on this okay all right so as he was corrected though he comes and he says hey we got to you know in his mind he said we've got to we've got to take this up a notch right instead of just going church church church church church church church he said you tell those people I'm talking to them I'm talking to the bride cuz only the Pride will get the revelation of the Seven Seals and a lot of them won't either right if it's not taught to you you'll never get it because truly y'all know we've been taught by Brother Dale for so many years the first seal Revelation the first seal is not that the white hor Rider Antichrist that's in the Bible the opening of those seals is for you amen and full Redemption for you we'll get into that when as we go up when we get to The Headstone cuz that it CU brother R stopped one day and he said he is those seals he is the Seals All right so if he's the seals then the white horse rider was the Antichrist right it was an exposing or a revealing of where Satan was at the time and that now he's got to get out of here so that God can take over my life and your life never since Jesus Christ was on the earth I believe this 100% % he's never had such a formidable opponent than he does right now and that's the wife of Jesus Christ all right and we're going to keep believing that I'm just going to believe it and I'm going to believe it until it's like brother Brown said or somebody said said if Satan pulls all your teeth out we can just gum him to death we'll just keep guming him until till something happens all right so brother Brown tells us there's been churches churches Brides churches Brides brides but there's got to come one you see how that headstone it goes up yeah big wide a lot of people can live by faith but now not a lot of people can live by brotherly kindness hello somebody I'm one of them amen I know where I'm at in this thing but you're going to lose a lot down here as you go up to here that's why it's narrow brother R says it Narrows to a point and that's what it does it Narrows to a point but there's been churches churches bride Church churches Brides brides but there's got to come one Hallelujah there's got to come a real bride not that all of them were false but this one is going to take the real truth the mechanics and the Dynamics and make it fire 100% I just believe that Hebrews 4:12 the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword that's why it takes the full word to pierce you you got to know what that is Brother John it can't be a a a a three-bladed knife right right amen can't be a trinitarian knife it's got to be one knife with double edge going in and coming out the dividing of su of Soul and Spirit brother R was the only one that could go down inside of you and just break you apart amen amen listen I didn't have to be sitting in his congregation I didn't get broke apart with listening to the tape cuz he he he delves into things that man has never delved into am and he sits there and tells you he said oh cancer is a Bru cell or backslid cell and he keeps talking and it's like he's inside that person's body well probably he was cuz God revealed to him everything the word of God first though because remember Divine Healing is not a major it's a minor all right the healing of the soul is the major all right healing the soul one time you don't have to worry about it you can be healed today and die tomorrow that's right ask Lazarus but the word of God is what we were supposed to get the restoration of the word he said that was the bait on the hook but we still try to Major on a minor we still try to oh if we had Divine Healing no we get the word first that will come signs follow the believer follow the believer not back here up here all right get the word right get the Soul and Spirit because I mean listen since I've been doing this for 130 something sermons it has it has showed me that the sometimes um um excuse me the way I act I know where it comes from ain't it you Regina you got that furrowed look cuz even in my body like brother Randon would tell us he said he said you know you can go in other words let me in my own English you can go back crazy and still have the Holy Ghost right amen you can go crazy as a bat and still have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul right and then your spirit realm is over here and listen that's where you sin you can't sin in your soul if you're born again that's right how can God sin that's right so separate that that's what he saying separating my soul is redeemed sealed ready to go it's waiting on my spirit to catch up with it cuz remember your soul if it's born again it's Eternal and it's in an eternal condition yes sir yet you're getting older in your body that's the Paradox you know we was talking about the other day I just believe that when you got born again your soul is now 18 years old and never gets any older how could God get any older if that's God inside of you but now the spirit realm and the and the body is kind of like the capsule around the around the soul and it's kind of keeping it you know keeping it pushed pushed in you know that's why I said a year or so ago I said what I tell you let it out whatever you got let it out if it's wrong we can help you if it's right you can help all of us but just let it out but you got to know where you're letting it out from cuz our problem is not in in our listen in our daily walk if you're born again your problem's not in your soul that's right amen one more time your Soul's perfect your Soul's sinless that's why God's looking at cuz you accept him he comes in and burns all that out there's no more hint of sin if there's any sin in there God and a devil can't reside in your soul at the same time one or the other Faith or doubt not faith and doubt when brother Ram gave the analogy of the of the old Indian Indian said oh Indians said which you know he said and say after my conversion you got to remember when he said that after my conversion in inside of me is white dog black dog that wasn't in his soul his soul was a white dog the spirit was a black dog he said which one wins he said the one I feed the most it is the one you feed the most but if you're born again today your Soul's just as Eternal as God is never has sin never will sin never had a bad thought amen he say it's literally in Heavenly places in another dimension but it's still inside of you now your Soul's not out there somewhere your Soul's right here this is the real you this is what's talking to you today all right but we've been pierced by the word of God in the end time to tell us how to deal with these things how to deal with the Statue of perfect man and and you can ask where's my brother-in-law where's Richard Richard's in the back he came from another church when Daddy started preach been 20 years ago ever how long they've been married um well ain't no telling well aby's how old 16 17 23 years that's exactly right because Sarah and them were married the same year right yeah I was there both of them but uh we're just a big family but he came from another church and he never heard a word about Statue of perfect man message church right and when brother Dale started preaching and he read a quote where brother Brown said these things are required he said that hit me right in the soul he said and Aaron went there too Aaron's right there that's his brother he'll tell you the same thing when that he said that hit me right in between the eyes just like a shotgun that these things are required they're not just something brother Brian preached to fill up space they're required for you to become a mature Christian all right so that's the pretense that we have of this whole thing that's our predestination that's our destiny is somebody to come to that statue of perfect man our brother I'm just preached in a nice drawing and and you know it's just fill up space I don't either brother but our soul is the real you and if it's born again it's you and God together as persons vulcanized to where it can never be pulled apart now your spirit realm can be pulled apart right memory reasoning conscious affection imagination that's where God works and that's where Satan works that's the Battleground it's not really in that gray matter I know brother R said the greatest battle ever fought was in your mind well what's in your mind memory reasoning you don't reason with your guts you reason with your with your with your uh brain all right conscious is in your imagination's in your all right and you don't love with this thing right here this is just something that pumps we say heart but it's not the heart of you the heart of you is your soul then you have a spirit that's wrapped around it and it actually is the one you feed the most is the one that controls you the most just saying all right so the soul is the real you that's the one that God's going to judge remember the Bible says do not worry about the person that can kill the body he said you worry about the one that can kill the what the soul listen God's only one that can make a soul and he's the only one that can kill a soul Satan cannot kill a soul he can't make one and he can't get rid of it praise God you see who's in control Satan's not in control of this thing God's in control of everything that's going on just like we were talking about Wednesday night he's Sovereign he's got this thing worked out we just got to you know what get out of the way thought them two brothers were talking other day and brother said brother how how long you been been a Christian and and and the old man says well brother I've been in the way about 25 years and that guy said that's your problem you've been in the way about 25 years so anyway Ephesians 1:4 says according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation the world we know that's the Providence of God we know that's the for knowledge of God knowing it was going to happen before it happened right that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love now listen there was a time we weren't Ho Holy there was a time we were blame blameful not blameless that's right amen having predestinated us what unto the adoption of children so if we're going to have to come to adoption we got to have these things working in our life that's why it's a requirement it's not a requirement to be a Christian it's a requirement to be an adult Christian everybody with me having predestinated us into the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will and adoption series brother Ram says your adoption is not your birth your adoption is your placing that's what we're going to talk about in just a few minutes right we were predestinated unto adoption all right listen it's like well my sister's not here but she's a school teacher and she went all the way to 12 you know 12 grades and then plus you know she's almost got a doctorate degree and um and she's smart she can teach that gives her the the requirements to teach all right I only went a couple years in college so I don't have that's not I don't have a requirement to teach why would I try to teach somebody something that I didn't know anything about amen what are you saying by the way there has never been an adoption of a Son of God since Jesus you can argue Paul if you want to but the adoption brings that headstone back the adoption brings everything together so we had to have a Prophet come in the end time go out Arizona right get met with a cloud caught up in the cloud and I believe that's when he was adopted because when was Jesus adopted on a mountain with a cloud and a voice amen all right so we know that I can put my confidence not in a cloud but that the person that I am looking toward that I reading his literature that I'm listening to his voice that person had come to adoption he came to the apex of the of the time that he was in so now whatever he had he was a scholar not a book scholar a holy ghost scholar he was a church messenger he was the Bride of Jesus Christ he was all the different things but he was identified in the Bible That's Malachi 4 all right so that's enough for me so he comes to adoption and he tells us he went out there he didn't tell us that he was adopted he told us a story about going out to out west and being caught up in a in a constellation of angels and what did what he say and told to go back to Jeffersonville the seals weren't open at the cloud that's right that's right Jesus didn't preach Matthew 24 in the cloud that's right cuz watch Matthew 24 that's the seals he had to come down off that mountain right that's right he had to come down off that mountain and then he came to Jeffersonville and the seals were open there Jesus comes down off the mountain brother rown said it's about 6 months before he was uh put on the cross and in Matthew 24 he preaches six seals all right so brother Brown was not the first one to preach seals Jesus preached them right he preached six seals and he was number seven so that's good enough for me but listen brother Brandon was my seventh seal he introduced me to him I've got to decide whether I want to enter in that or not okay so let's look at adoption for a minute so we know then I have confidence that what brother R told us about adoption was not from hearsay or from a book it was from an experience right amen so God told us through the prophet if you're going to get it you're going to get it from that man right there cuz he's restored everything back he's brought everything back to where the faith of the fathers were which was here Peter couldn't preach on them if he didn't know anything about them so the statue of perfect man was preached in Peter's time but it just wasn't all put together so that we can understand it there wasn't a pyramid there wasn't all the church AE Messengers it wasn't the seven uh cities and we sure didn't know anything about having a holy spirit up here we thought it was down here and sure it is but that one up there is a extra anointing of the Holy Ghost we already been through that but we go through it maybe again later on when we start up to The Headstone second Peter 1 says for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be Barren or unfruitful in other words you will be mature you'll not be tossed to to and fro you not say I don't know if I need to go to church or I don't know if I I this that I promise you one thing if anything enters your mind that says you don't need to go to church because of XYZ it's the devil no one thing's for sure I don't care if he talks to you with an Angelic voice and it sounds so sweet and it sounds so nice it's the devil why do you think God can't deny word can he deny his word no that's why Holy Ghost people will come to church if you don't you're denied his word that's right for if these things be in you bound they make you I like that word in that big I like to they it makes you these virtues make you into something they make you to where you will not be unfruitful or Barren in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lack these things is blind and cannot see a far off and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence look at all these what you call these adjectives right amen right diligence um let's go back over here abound all these great adjectives it it it's not just well well praise God I got brotherly kindness I don't hate my neighbor no more but I really don't like the way he see there right no if these things be in you in AB bound let me just put it in my terms there's no room for the devil when God's in there and he's pushing out remember they well you know I'm going to go ahead and tell you cuz God said he hated the Deeds of nickas and so God hates amen yeah he hates the devil the devil hates him the only problem is this one's got an end this one never did I'll go with this one it didn't have no end for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you now what happened in the end time there was an Open Door actually in the age before us if you look in the church age book There Was An Open Door started in the Philadelphia age of what of missionary work all right but you can also say that's an open door for me and you like I when I was preaching brother how's funeral Revelations 4:1 John types who the bride right John is the type of the whole bride Amen in Revelations 4:1 there was a door open where in heaven and it says come up hither right come up hither amen and when he got up there he didn't see three he saw one right he heard a voice yes I said come up here did you hear that voice say come up here wherefore I will not be negligent to put you and always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present day truth like I said before over and over and over as long as we don't as long as we don't change anything over and over is good all right Matthew 17:5 here we go while he yet spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed now I'm going to bring this into this to the present day and um and we're going to see the two things fit together here in just a second while he yet Behold a bright Cloud this is Matthew 17 he's up on top of the mountain with who Peter James and John there's a cloud comes down over Jesus and there's a voice that comes out and says Behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son and whom I'm well pleased now that's what he said to out of the heavens when Jesus was baptized when you got born again God said the same thing this is my beloved Son and whom I pleased to dwell listen if he's not pleased to dwell he's not wish it washy God's not wish it washy but when he took you as his own when he gave the new birth he was pleased of something about you he was pleased to dwell inside of you come on somebody you got to be able to know that when you get to New Birth he's pleased to be inside of you now listen there's a lot of things he's not pleased with afterwards and that's getting into your doors in that Spirit realm see that's the other part you got to you you the devil's gone the unclean spirit's gone out walk in dry places Seth rest find us none come back but now this time when he comes back it's sealed yes God can't get out Satan can't get in but then Satan says hey hey you were a good soldier of mine I I see you're still cuz remember Hey listen the devil's spiritual the devil's anointed amen so he's so anointed he said I can't get back in that soul but I'm sure going to stay in your spirit I'm going to make sure you remember the things you used to do I'm going to make sure that you reason with the word of God the wrong way I'm going to make sure that I'm going to be in your conscience all the time you know they always talk about the little devil on this side the angel on this side they I wish they were on my shoulder huh I wish they were out here I could knock them off they're in here so here's a situation Matthew 17 Behold a voice out of the cloud said this is my beloved Son in whom I pleased to dwell now you get to another position hear ye him amen now we know that's adoption brother R told us many many times but now watch this is now that was Matthew's view all right so now Luke has come up and he's writing the same he's writing the same part but it's going to be a little bit wordy a little bit different y'all know Matthew Mark Luke and John was written by four different people right about the same person and basically about the same thing but it was four different views it wasn't four different views it was four views right one saw two Blind Men one saw one that don't make the Bible wrong and that don't make Matthew right and John wrong all right so Luke he's looking he writes this by the Holy Spirit he says and it came to pass as they departed from him Peter said unto Jesus Master it is good for us to be here and let us make three Tabernacles one for thee and one for Moses and one for Elias not knowing what he said cuz Peter wasn't even a Christian at the time Peter was a follower of Christ he was a disciple sure but he didn't have the Holy Ghost all right while he thus spake there came a cloud and overshadowed them all right this is the same thing Matthew but now watch he's given a little bit different angle at it he says and they feared as they entered the cloud now the other one Jesus was overshadowed voice came out here pet I mean Luke is telling that they feared as they entered the cloud so was all four of them three and one right right and there came a voice out of the cloud saying this is my beloved Son hear him now watch here's my point cuz I want you to see something cuz we were talking about it just the other day and when the voice was passed Jesus was found alone praise God Amen when you see Jesus only you're doing good and they kept it close watch and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen they told nobody why cuz it wasn't for them they didn't know them come to adoption come on stay awake for a [Music] minute some of you already went to land of ND kan's one that did that but it wasn't for them it was for us they entered the class everybody with me now let's go to questions and answers I was talking brother George Smith and everybody knows brother George his brother Bram son-in-law and U I tried to get some firsthand information from him a lot of people don't like brother George but I do he's matter of fact and I appreciate matter of fact people cuz I seem to be that way sometimes myself praise the Lord anyhow we're all different all right God liked me this way okay or it made me different he's still still working on me so question so anyway so now that was the first seal just a few minutes ago when brother R was telling he said I now I'll call you a bride all right so now he's preached a whole week this was Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday he was preaching he preached to the six seal now is everybody with me he said the greatest week of all my Ministry was this week right here it was the opening of the seals that had been closed since Jesus was on Earth did everybody agree with that okay I agree greatest ser and I've seen he's seen thousands heal Millions heal probably no greater than the perfect word being opened and he was able to understand it and then he's getting ready to give it to a group of people all right he's fixing to preach the seventh seal on Sunday night he said we're going to stop now at first of the week he said we're going to have a healing heing service on Sunday morning cuz remember there's always a a breach that's right or a gap between 6 and seven read your Bible there's six seals there's a gap then there's a Seven Seals on Revelations 8 Revelations 10:7 is in between the trumpets 6 to 7 so there's always between 6 and 7even is something happened there's a gap there all right the Brother D was preached this years ago so y'all understand most of you do but look the reason there's a gap is is because he wants everybody to catch up because we're humans there was so much going on that week and and he was like I'm preaching the greatest uh sermons I've ever preached the night of The Sixth Seal he said okay we're going to have questions and answers tomorrow now I didn't pull the quote up but most of youall know what I'm going to say brother R said look ask me about the seals right make have these questions pertain to what I've been preaching all week right that's what he wanted him qu he didn't want questions about panty hoes and and and one God and water baptism he won questions on the seals well out of 25 questions he got two that had anything to do with the seal so he knew right then they weren't getting it I mean the greatest sermon he preached and for six days straight and and somebody asked can I wear pajamas to bed yeah pajama pants and you know what brother brandham having full of Brotherly kindness he answered every one of them questions but inside of his soul he was like I'm going to read you right here cuz brother George Smith he asked me the other day he was redoing he not redoing the seal book but he's making it more friendly for people to interpret in other languages all right he's not taking anything out he's just kind of he said massaging it you know how George is he said what's the greatest thing in that seal book to you you personally to you what's the greatest thing in that seal book I said when brother Bram said it's not for them that's the greatest thing in that seal book cuz if it wasn't for them it's for me then I can understand all the revelations but I just want to make sure that it was for me watch and he kind of looked at me you know how George does and he said oh I see what you're talking about I said yeah that's important cuz it's me it wasn't them back there in 1963 they weren't getting it I'm going to read you right here and then also knowing that right among you things are happening see I know I know look that you don't see it amen see I'm just positive you don't see it so now if he's preaching six Services of the greatest anointing he's ever had in his life opening up the seals that had had been closed since Jesus was here he says you don't see it so it's got to be for another group of people CU God don't do anything and cast his you know you know Pearls Before Swine and you know right and it won't return void so it was for somebody so brother Mark I can this for me it wasn't for them so they weren't supposed to get it they weren't supposed to study it out we were listen I am positive you don't see it listen Peter James and John up on the mountain they didn't see it they didn't understand and you say brother R that's a hard thing for you to say I know it is but look let me just say this now I suppose this is just tape for oursel and so forth praise God it was for us but let me say this see that you you you don't you don't get it see and you're not supposed to get it now he's preaching to Christians he's not preaching to heathens he's preaching to Christians bride not wife bride he's preaching to the bride all right different different different situation here and you're not supposed to get it so don't try to interpret anything and they tried and messed up made the seventh seal polygamy made it two Souls made it this made it that don't try to put your interpretation to it in other words Peter James and John don't tell this to nobody CU you're going to mess it up amen right that's why they didn't say anything to anybody CU they didn't understand what who was the one that stood up and said hey let's make three Tabernacles Jesus is like come on Peter just shut up for a minute you'll only get further away just take my advice if you believe me now if God has given me favor in your sight and you know that them Revelations and things I've been here with you everybody believe brother R was a prophet I just want to make sure I had skipped out into another another service over here I've been here with you a long time and it's always been right now see he's been there with the people a long time and now to double prove it right it hooks right in with the word and we know that for a fact so you know it's thus sayith the Lord that's exactly it's prove to you now take my advice as your brother don't put your own interpretation to anything amen amen just go on and live a good Christian Life be bride cuz you can't be wife you're not getting this Revelation it's going to come to a group of people right about the end time cuz you'll only wind yourself away from the real thing when you do it you'll only wind your way again away from the thing and all you are conscious and know that there's something mysterious happening and it's happening and I know what it is you know what it was they're not getting it it's for another group of people that's going to have to sit under a five-fold Ministry to listen to a five-fold Ministry because the Bible tells us the perfecting of the saint is not for one Prophet Bible First Bible First Bible says we will be perfected by fivefold Ministry all right okay I know we believe that and I know what it is now look now I'm not saying that it's the grace of God that lets me know what it is it's something that's tremendous and it's gone right now we still believe brother brownan was a prophet amen we all do right he's telling the people they ain't getting it and whatever the anointing of that time was is gone it's gone right now and there's not a way in the world world for you to see it wow but so help me with this Bible in my hand I know what it is it's come to a group of people in the end time to get us ready for a body change to get us ready for Rapture amen I'll clap myself so it wasn't for them that cloud lifted off and didn't come back to right there why are you quiet God had to come in a sign he showed a sign and he showed it to the world and and if some of you don't have not read uh watched that service with brother what is his name Bob what's his name no the the the brother that broke it down up at brother Luke Gibson's Church he's a physicist or some kind of scientist brother h brother Bill Bill rth yes he broke it down and and they can believe whatever they want to I don't care am but there is no rocket made on the earth even an atomic bomb that can make that much vapor and make it 20 something miles wide and so many miles long no way if it was a rocket it might be a little I don't serve a message that's a little I serve a big God with a big message they showed the whole world as a sign that he has come down just like he did 2,000 years ago on top of that mountain and brought us the opening of the seals I just contend that's that and and if I didn't I'd sit down if I didn't believe that I'd sit down and never preach again but I believe it with all my heart God sent us a prophet to prove that God was here in his bride in this message and that we're supposed to carry it on to the coming of the Lord not just sit back and go well brother brandom he said just live a good Christian Life that's okay that was for them thank you that was for them that's not for them that's for us right all right Hebrews 5:10 says called of God a high priest after the order of mzd of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing you're dull of hearing this is Paul to the Hebrews for when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat that was that group that was back there listen they would have literally choked on it if they had got to Revelation because it wasn't time God brings it all in his time and he brings it in dispensations that was not the dispensation for that okay amen amen this is the dispensation for it but for everyone that uses Milt is unskillful and the word of righteousness for he's a bab but strong meat belongs to them that are full age even those who who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil our problem is is sometimes that gets a little cloudy amen we pray for me okay if it don't bother you pray for me sometimes that gets a little cloudy the good Evil part all right here we are in adoption let's look I Jim was saying this between services and I appreciate listen if she would if she would have said that to a to a minister 30 years ago that I ain't going there woman ain't supposed to know nothing she said you know she said it's not an adoption until the baby's born right you can still have the paperwork and all that stuff but until that baby's born and breathes and it's a soul it can't be adopted natural types of spiritual until you're a newborn baby in Christ and you have this baptism of holy ghost in your soul you can't be adopted but now you're able you're in the line of adoption because you're born again all right so now look you know what happened when that boy became a certain age that boy was adopted into the family now listen you got to take the adoption that we're talking about here as like this one was of another family well we were this one though naturally and then they don't want them anymore or the parents die or XYZ and then you adopt them but now remember they become your kids that's right even the birth certificates changed praise God praise God I don't have an old birth certific from Samuel and Peggy Dale that's going to kill me that's going to put me in the grave and they're going to go oh that was Samuel wayale he's born on January 26 1960 and no I was born December the 17th till till July the 4th or 5th of 1998 that's when I got born amen all right and and you you said oh you didn't get Bor and get at one time no I went through justification I went to sanctification and I went through the process of the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right you can receive it one night you can receive it one day you can receive it at one moment but some of us are slow amen but I want to know that I am really Justified yes that I am really Sanctified that's all gone and then God seals me by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the new birth am amen oh don't miss this now look that boy was adopted into the family in other words he was still a family he was a family member he was born to that Daddy literally all right but what he's going to do is he's going to positionally place him in the family of authority all right in the family comma with authority all right so they took him out in a public place put a special robe on him and had a ceremony seven angels actually and all the people of the city gathered around and look but you know let me stop right here real quick we keep pointing to this we keep pointing to brother Brown being adopted that's not going to adopt you amen that's right that's it no you got to believe the message of the hour you got to believe that you don't not taking milk anymore that you want strong meat you going you're the one that's going to have to have a mountain experience amen yeah they took him out in a public place put a special robe on him had a ceremony and all the people of the city gathered around and looked and when they looked upon this boy and the father had a ceremony of adoption oh don't miss this after that son was adopted his name on the checkbook was good as his daddy's now the the quote I read you this morning was God give you a checkbook with his name signed on it just to make sure that you don't mess up but now it's so much of full Authority he say here here's checkbook you write it for whatever you need because I have put my complete trust in you I have watched you down through your Christian Life I have watched your experience and it's true and you're just like your daddy there's where God's trying to get his church yes just say to this mountain be moved and it will move Authority sons of God the whole Creations groaning and waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God am that's why we can't take denominational ideas they get cut off they can't go higher they can't go in Revel you can't have a revelation there is no revelation of God being three there's no revelation of baptism and a title there's no Revelation to that so it's just dead right waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God waiting to a spot look where that sickness will be arise and it will be there be that way the blind will receive their sight deaf and dumb we pray for them now but then you'll command it oh now brother rown said we pray for it now but then you'll command it right wow yeah wow again amen didn't say these signs shall follow them that believe they shall pray for the sick he said they shall cast out devils not I will they will if you stay to this Mount not if I say Amen if you stay to this mountain if you stay to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart that's why I like brother Keith was preaching here not too long ago brother Keith Reed from Jamaica and he made a wonderful point we come to a place that we talk about adoption we talk about calling the dead Saint out of the ground why can't we call our kids back yeah what's the difference in a mountain and a sa that's my kids I will call for them and they'll answer you'll call for yours and they'll answer but you can't do it as a baby that's right amen cuz you know what brother R I read you that quote Wednesday night brother brother R said Satan is a bluff and he knows when you're bluffing right and he don't have to do nothing if you're bluffing nothing he knows you're bluffing but we need to still confess it though keep confessing it keep confessing God you promised me my children that's my mountain that I got to get moved amen what we need is adoption Sons and Daughters needs adoption listen we always talk about the guys you women too you got to come to adoption yeah you got to come to speak in terms with God Amen now watch but how can the church the Pentecostal church and the Methodist and Baptist Churches be adopted until they come to discipline now here we're going to look at something right here we've got to be disciplined first God could not trust this power with the church it's hard to tell what they' do with it in other words how could a father trust his business with a boy that might simply pollute his whole inheritance he couldn't do it the church has got to come to a place to where it's disciplined God's Own that work right now discipline patience temperance the virtues disciplined knowing what God wants and not have to go huh and I'll tell you how that happens about the adoption I was going to back I'll back up right here but even in Israel because the Bible says that adoption pertains to Israel in the Bible all right but we take it as Gentiles because that's our growth development that's our you know going up the statue of perfect man or whatever more but over in Israel m if that Mom and Dad were here they' tell you they went through one it's called a bar mitzvah have you ever heard of that well look it up Google it I'm sure you'll find something Bar Mitzvah is when they take a son they take him out and I'll tell you a little background of this in a minute they take him out put a special robe on actually they have a party they have a ceremony they have a party they bring the guy the the kid out and said hey this person has come to a certain uh level of maturity now what happens is in Israel you couldn't now the reason we look at this is because remember Jesus when he was 13 now look he was a baby he comes up to about two years old then you don't hear nothing from him until he's 13 come on that's right at 13 he he pops up and he's in a temple right and he's reading the Scrolls all right in Jewish tradition you cannot read a scroll till you're 13 years old so they have a bar mitvah which bar means son remember Simon bar Jonas that means Simon was the son of Jonas bar means son of Mitzvah means promise so a son of Promise that's me and you we have our own bar mits for all the time if we're going up a statue of perfect man we've come to a place that we can at 13 now in Israel at 13 years old they're allowed to go into the temple open the Scrolls and read them well that's exactly what Jesus did at 13 years old he didn't listen he didn't break the law amen he had to come under the law that's right the law said you had to be a certain age before you could read well that's what he did remember they found him they come back found him doing what reading the Scrolls what about that the word reading the word he said I must be about my what father business all right but that's what a bar mitzvah is now they put a robe on you they put all kind of these pretty streamers and all this stuff and they have a big party celebration because your son has come to adoption or bar mitzvah or become the son of the promise all right so that's something you can that was a life lesson so now let's get back to scripture Romans 8 ver 21 says because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption and the Glorious Liberty of the children of God now look because the creat creature creation itself remember the creation or the cre or the the creation underneath Adam fell because of who Adam man fell everything else fell underneath him so that's why the whole world is groaning waiting for the adoption to with the Redemption of the body we're going to read that the whole for we know that the whole creation verse 22 granth and travaileth in pain together until now listen every earthquake Quake every typhoon every hurricane amen it's caused because this world is going through birth pains and it's because me and you have not got to the right place to run them out of existence cuz that whole world is groaning and rocking why do you think there's going to be a big earthquake when we leave this place all of creation is saying hey get back to where you were get back to where there's not dead animals on the side of the road get back to where there's not all this sin and debauchery going on let's get back to that amen that's what's groaning well you you know why you're the Earth this is what supposed to groan first sorry for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit me and you we are supposed to be groaning within ourself waiting for the adoption to with the Redemption are to witness to Wi to witness are to be part of the Redemption of our body cuz right now our body is not redeemed because mine's sweating and hurting in places you know I was thinking and we we've said this before and I'll say it again when brother brandham you know to prove uh I guess God gave all these things to brother brandham to prove maybe not to himself where he was at but to prove to us where he was all right so because remember this is after all this that's after the seals he goes up on a mountain and the Lord says there's a storm coming and a man says there's a storm coming get off the mountain brother Brown said I could have survived cuz I'm a mountain man he said but them people down there he said I knew they wouldn't be able to survive it's okay I'm I'm just I'm paraphrasing I'm not telling you this whole thing people crucify you for not saying it word by word but anyway here's the whole Gest of the thing so here's brother Brown I'm in a situation to where God saying hey it's in your hands you've got a group of people that you trying to get off the mountain and you're not going to get down there fast enough to get them off the mountain he was up here hunting up high all right he knew they were down there and they were just going to get I mean feets of snow sound like Jew forny feets of snow feet of snow I love brother juel we all love brother juel but God is telling him say hey you got a situation in your hand son what are you going to do brother what are you going to do so he said says okay inspiration strikes him and he says okay he said storm go away he said there' be Sunshine he said it wasn't just what 10 minutes that rolled out sun came out but that's not the end of the story he's hunting deer and y' all of yall know that hunts deer especially during season they're real skittish and they will not let you get close to you going to see the rear end before you see their eyes right brother D amen so here he is hunting in a place that they're hunting a lot on a lot a lot of people hunting so what did he say so he called the storm out of existence and he's like man remember what he remember what God came down and said hey walk with me for a little while walk with me for a little while so brother R said he goes walking down the trail said all of a sudden there's I think two or three deer he said they're got that bewildered look on their face he said they're not running off he said he said they get almost to where I can touch them with my gun barrel kind of odd really odd that nature would do that because that deer scared a man well that was something going on there was an anointing there just for a moment that if you could have read those deers mind they'd be looking at that they'd be looking at him and say you know said our ancestors felt this in the garden Adam is that you are you back here hallelujah we're not scared of you that's what adoption is bringing this thing back not listen he's not going to give you Authority and you're going to zap your boss out of existence CU you had a bad day that's power without character yes sir cuz some of y'all would do it I work for the post office I got several I'm just kidding I work for the government but yeah but Power without character well see he was looking at Power we're looking at Power with character yes he said I could have shot those deer yes oh yeah he was hunting he had full right to shoot him but he didn't he said they got so close I could almost touch them with the gun barrel well the Gun Barrel only about this long the whole gun is so it's about from me to Sister Regina you won't get that close to a deer I'll promise you that unless something's going on for just a moment time rolled back and saw a Creator saw an Adam standing on the earth that they're not scared of that the lion is not scared the ox and all the different ones can lay down with each other what do you think you know that's not what going to happen because it's in the Bible cuz I don't believe anything happens just for nothing right that's going to be brought back by a group of people that just for a moment we're going to see Adam again a small portion of Eden hey we better be able to um we got about 2,000 years of dead Saints it's waiting on me and you to come to this we got a prophet waiting on us to come to this because Hebrews 11:40 says what they without us cannot be made perfect you say no brother that just we're going there's going to be a resurrection and it's just going God's got a a calendar with an an act on it and that's today it's going to happen no it will not happen until you and I get ready amen the voice of the Resurrection is already here you're not going to hear a toot toot toot from the sky like I said before this morning you everybody in the world thinks oh when that trumpet sounds it's already sounded I declare to you today I have heard the voice of the Resurrection I've just got to get myself into that I've got to get myself into the right tomb amen hallu Galatians 3:23 this is kind of how adoption is all right is everybody with me but before Faith came we were kept under the law listen if you're not born again today you're under the law dos and don'ts yes and it will kill you shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed wherefore the law was our school Master teacher to bring us under Christ that we might be justified by faith but look but after that faith is come we're no longer under School listen we're not doing away with the Holy Ghost cuz that's your school Master but he's not going to have to do it Paul said go back and teach you about the baptism teach you about one God teach you about not cutting your hair teach you about not right the first principles of the Oracles of God we need to move on from that if we have a problem with that that's okay that means you're a baby please realize that position but don't stay there move forward right cuz like I said before you people will tell you stuff well that's just the Old Testament about the pants and all that stuff you know women not supposed to wear a garment pertaining to man they have yeah they tell me I said that's the Old Testament I said so is The Ten Commandments you going to do away with them too oh that was Old Testament y'all live in the Old Testament praise God you tell me where you can wear them and I'll tell you where you can't amen I can read in the Bible all right so that's just the way I see it I'm going to stand before God when his word says this right here right all right if I stay in this right here he can't condemn me or judge me that's right already been judged but if I step outside of this into the law it's a law of dos and don'ts yes look for wherefor the law I'm reading the Bible I'm not making this up okay wherefore the law was our school Master to bring us unto Christ that we might be justified by faith but look but after that faith has come we are no longer under a school Master for you are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus praise many of you has ever received Bap been baptized in Christ have put on Christ that's why we baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because it's not a title we're in a family name I am a father but that's not my name sir there is neither Jew nor Greek Bond or free male or female for you're all one in Christ Jesus yes sir and if you be Christ in are you Abraham's seed and look and what there we go to the air part Heir is according to the promise Galatians 4:1 this is a continuation I know all of you know this but Paul writes letters he didn't write chapters man put those chapters in there it's a continuation of writing of Paul man's the one that broke him apart and put all the verses and all that in so let's go to Galatians 4:1 which is a continuation of Galatians 3 now I say that the heir as long as he's a child now look Heir Heir means you're a child of God a you're in the family all right right The Heir as long as he's a child watch now differ nothing from a servant start down here I've had several businesses and so is my brother I'm glad daddy didn't have one remember what he said he said if he said if I had a business my kids would learn how to clean toilets first that's right amen praise God he's not he didn't have one of them that's what he said didn't he he said that plainly many times amen we'd start cleaning toilets I have cleaned a few toilets in my life but but but the heir as long as he's a child he dith nothing from a servant in other words your babies yes but somebody's got to come out of that somebody's got to grow up get out of the diapers look though he be Lord of all though down in his soul he's a born again believer but is under tutors and governors and I'm going to tell you the um um meaning of those two words look until the time appointed of the father so you're under ministers teachers pastors evangelist all these things now watch until the time appointed of the father now tutor is one who who's care or honor anything has been instructed a curator a guardian a steward or manager of a household of L and overseer I watch this is the one I like right here one who has the character now this is a tutor we know what tutors are we've had tutors before all right one who has the care and tutelage of a child not an adult a child either where the father is dead a guardian of miners or where the father is still alive my father is still alive natural and spiritual but spiritually my father's alive but he has sent a tutor to tutor us right all right now Governor is the manager of a household or House of household Affairs a steward or manager they're almost the same but watch this this is a little bit different superintendent whether Freeborn or as was usually the case a Freed Man or Slave To Whom the head of the house or PR proprietor has entrusted the management of his Affairs the care of receipts and expenditures the duty of dealing out the proper portion to every servant and even to the children not yet of age praise God the manager of a farm or landed estate an overseer the superintendent of the city's finances the treasurer of a city or treasurer orestes of a king metaphorically it's the apostles and other Christian teachers and Bishops and overseers in other words one who's over the household all right not just teaching you the word of God but all of everything your life and everything your manner of life and all the different things that you do or don't do verse three even so we when we were children now look we Paul Paul said I was a CH he was I was a child too even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come that's us that's now right now God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law remember he didn't come to destroy the law he came to make an honorable and able to live the Ten Commandments and able to live what the Old Testament tells us to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because ye are Sons Born Again Believers God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying daddy daddy or Abba Father wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ how be it then now watch how be it then when you knew not God there's a time in your life that you didn't know God Amen you did service unto them which by Nature are no Gods amen Bud wazer Bud Light porography let me can I just keep naming them that's what you were under you were Servants of these people these demons look which by Nature are no Gods but now after that you have known God or rather are known of God how turn you again to the weak and beggarly elements why how in the world can you turn around and go back to what you were doing if you've been enlightened and given all these gifts and given all these promises how in the world can you go back in the world you never got it here if you go back in the world right how turn you again to the weak and beggarly elements where to you Des ye desire again to be in bondage that's question you want to go back into bondage no I want to be free the believer's position in Christ we'll stop right here just a second right here look now in a spiritual sense after we were born into Christ we become children of God now he's explaining but then see God knows best now this boy after he got a certain age he had to be adopted into that same family he was born into that's why your Born Again experience is not your adoption it puts you in line for it right everybody still believe we we got a prophet and that's what he says right okay just want to make sure and any Minister knows that's the placing of a son he had to be adopted into the family that he was born into all right could you imagine that but that's the Old Testament teaching Paul's referring to it here in Ephesians the Church of Ephesus now when the father look when the father became aware that this boy was not worthy he never disowned him amen praise God he never disowned him never kicked him out the prodical son was still a son he never disowned him he was still his boy amen but in human terms he wasn't very happy with him but he couldn't put confidence in him that's right he was too carried about with all kind of winds of Doctrine that's what the scripture says be not carried about by every wind of doctr be stabled always abounding in the works of the Lord he's he's actually paraphrasing first Peter that we just talked about for so much as you know your works is not in vain quickly wish we had stayed on that a while but notice read this right here this father then the day came when this boy maybe had been all right now he's talking about the one that was still a son still there still thought a lot of him but just couldn't trust him with anything all right but this boy this boy maybe had been all right and was a worthy man you hear that word worthy man he wasn't a baby he listened to the father he took instructions he was a good boy then the father taken him out into a public Street put a special clothes on him yeah right and then the father had a ceremony and adopted this his son into his family and then this son after he came out there was given no longer was he just like the servant under a tutor he was the boss now he was the boss because God made him the boss not because he made himself the boss everybody with me I hope this soaks real deep let's get way down deep this son was no more under a tutor but he was like his father father and his father gave him certain things to do the father might have told him you take care of this field over here see he's placing him in a position all right we need to find our what find our position or our placing where God placed us not where you want to be placed where God placed you amen I've always said if God wanted me to a pastor a church in South Florida I would question that if he said go to Alaska I go tomorrow so see that's my own desire that's not God's that's my desire see God don't want that you go where he tells you to go I don't have anything get South Florida well I do it's hot I like Alaska but that's my that's my my privilege to like those things God put it there for a reason the father might have told him you take care of this field over here or you do this over here you take care of the slaves you take care of whatever it was he was in full possession amen for he was adopted into that family and his name on a check was just as good as his daddies now what God has done the reason we see these things and know that there's something wrong friend we see the promises of God we see now as how adoption is supposed to work it's supposed to be full Authority that we're able to speak the word and it happened just like this we see the promises of God we see it in the word of God but look God has just began to my humble opinion to start adopting his son this was in uh 1955 wow 1955 to my humble opinion to adopting his son positionally calling him out to one side giving him a certain Ministry anointing them for that purpose and sending them out watch what happens when he does Ephesians 1 ver4 according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us into the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted and the Beloved and whom also we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein Heath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto what us the mystery of this will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself look that in the dispensation of the fullness of times yes right now he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance you know Jesus didn't come bring you inheritance boy you preach that in certain churches you better have the quote to back it up but I don't need it here we know brother BR said Jesus did not come to bring you an inheritance right your inheritance was before the foundation of the world Jesus came to get you back to your inheritance praise God thank God for a prophet also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according what to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will which is what his word that we should be we should be we should be to the praise of his glory he's happy for us to be where we're at he's happy that we're in him he's happy that we're setting in the church age that we're setting in he's happy that we're come to a position that we understand now what God did sending us a prophet and then showing us to a fivefold Ministry how that all these things are going to work out that we should be to the praise of his glory he first trusted in Christ in whom also you trusted after that you heard the word of Truth can't hear you can't believe something you had never heard the gospel of your salvation and whom also after that ye believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory let's stand to our feet cuz we get to now I'll back up a little bit but Jesus is talking about the stone which the builders rejected what stone was that Christ the fullness of the godhead bodily was rejected and has not been brought back until the end time and the prophet of God said that the bride would be not one person but the bride would be the fullness of the godhead bodily in the end time you believe that amen you love the Lord these are great promises that he gave us you know what you can leave them laying there or you can reach and get them one of the two amen you can leave them there if you want to you can leave this thing laying on the shelf and it will absolutely do you no good right open the will up sometime and read it read what you get read what's promised to you read the word of God remember I told y'all years and years ago I don't read the Bible Abraham did this I'll put my name in it a piece of those people are in me now come on like I said before if I were to write a a Love or story about me and jime about our 44 years of marriage and there'd be some good pages and it'd be some bad Pages a lot more good than bad but you know what to if I gave it to Michael and he's never been married before and you give it to Michael and Michael reads it and he's like okay y'all went to y'all every year October the 6 y'all went to uh a Pigeon Forge you stayed in Townson you stayed at docs Motel we need to go back there you stayed in Doc motel and you went to Cage's Cove and you saw deer and then you did that for about you kind like the way y'all do now but what if you were able because I was excited writing it brother Mark I was excited writing that cuz I was a participant I was there I witnessed all between the lines same way with God am he wrote this but what if you could take some way and take me and put me into Michael he'd read that book different sir that's what God's doing by the new birth amen he wrote this now the one that actually wrote this book is inside of me so out of my eyes I'm going to look at what I already wrote and he said he would show me things to come he would show me he would unravel this mystery that the world is worried whether we're going to do this and worried about Israel and worried about this I'm just worried about coming to adoption that should be our Focus that God is pleased to dwell with us and that he will hear what we say that's what I want Israel is going to do what Israel is going to do yes sir and we know for a fact they can't do anything until we're gone and praise God for a prophet to say look there will not one atomic bomb drop on the face of Earth while the bride's still here praise God so let's don't say oh I'm there may be a nuclear not till we get out of here they won't if you believe the prophet like I do he told us that but we're waiting the whole world is waiting this whole world is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God yes somebody that can stand up with some Authority and say no no no no Satan uh-uh not my kids you're not uh-uh not my aunt not my uncle not my husband not my uhuh no no no and there be enough power behind you dunamus amen

healing in your life somebody please raise your hand you've never been healed before witness to Healing I've witnessed a healing I saw a prayer cloth right here several years ago we were hunting dad always kept a bunch of these and I do in my pocket too in my billfold he keep a bunch of these in his Billo all the time everywhere he go and he pass them out we know what these are remember they took they took cloths off of Paul Acts 19 laid them on the people and demons were cast out people were healed right that's what we get this it's not Hocus Pocus and we don't sell these this is comes from the word of God all right so he took one of those we were hunting with a brother well he wasn't a brother in Christ he was just a guy that we hunted with his name was Terry M and Terry told us at the um we were hunting in November and then we always hunted in March we hunted in November for deer we hunted in March for Hogs brother Gary's been there with us um a time or two and um he knows it's a beautiful pristine Place beautiful place to hunt and beautiful facilities but anyway so Terry shows up and he he's kind of Gloom you know he's always been pretty chipper guy he worked for the uh uh USD or somebody in in Columbia South Carolina and uh he was kind of kind of a little gloomy and so we got to talking over dinner and uh he said I just want to tell all you guys that um I've only got three months to live they found cancer in my prostate and it's it's uh what you call it maxz into his limp nodes and his groin and into his bones and that's usually where that goes right he said I got three months to live Columbia University of Columbia South Carolina uh the doctors the hospital there said I've got three months to live um good hunting with you appreciate you love you he said I won't see you in March he said I'll be gone that didn't sit well with God that didn't sit well with brother Dale cuz he loved Terry and Terry was just a good honest man he wasn't a Believer but he was just a good honest man we love to hunt with him and that he walked out and got his Bell F he pulled the prayer cloth out and Terry was coming I can see it just now Terry was coming between the two buildings he was coming out you know he was getting tired he cuz he had cancer he was getting tired you know and he couldn't hunt cuz we did a lot of walking and um and he just kind of moped out daddy walked up to him and said said Terry said this this cloth we believe that we pray over it and according to Acts 19 we can take these prayer CLA pray over them and the sicks healed amen we've seen it all right so he gave it to Terry Terry said thank you Sam I appreciate that Daddy said and I really thought he was crazy he said put this in your billfold he said I'll see you in March we saw him in March and the March after that and the March after that and the March after that and the March he called me and he said tell your dad they can't find it he said the University of Columbia or Columbia University South Carolina Hospital has me on file as a mystery he lived nine years oh yeah cancer got him nine years he went hunting in Alaska for a month climbing mountains he hunted with us for nine years and finally he did pass away but hey 3 months he was supposed to been gone we were never to see that man again he said they don't know what happened Sam he said but I sure do appreciate daddy told him and March he said Terry you still got that prayer cloth he said it'll never leave me so he kept it with him and we hunted and we hunted and he just got back stronger and he he got back healthy again and his color came back and it was just a complete Miracle just by prayer CL right from a Believer to non to a non-believer now he didn't he wasn't an atheist but he just wasn't a Believer like well I know where that's that I know what that is Daddy had to explain it to him that's Authority and power behind that Authority praise God that we can come to that hand these prayer cloths to people amen listen we've seen people heal taking communion took communion Brother Dean that time house and he was just completely gone not dead but I mean he was just sick dead dog sick he raised up took communion started speaking in tongues come out of that thing and I hope I make communion wine that good it wasn't the wine by the way the communion wine is doing pretty well so brother Joe is doing a video on it now so we're going to give it to little churches so they can make their own communion wine not have to buy that junk outside cuz it's got all kind of stuff in it but anyway but there's Authority cuz all and it wasn't you know it wasn't daddy didn't Shake him you know didn't throw him on the ground and beat on him he just said look here's a promise the Bible will back it up you just believe it and Buddy when he called me cuz he didn't have D number he called me he said man he said whatever it is he said I'll see y'all in March he said because they the doctor told me he said I don't we don't know said we wrote mystery across this file well I know that mystery I was a part of it and you are a part of it every time you people healed and people that you're attached to that get better and all listen God can heal instantly and he can heal over time doesn't matter God's still the Healer listen he's up there right now in the hospital at Northeast Georgia Medical Center God is himself the Healer he's healing in people and they don't even know him that's right cuz remember there's no nobody healing them but God Satan's not healing them that's for sure Satan's wanted to put them in the hospital so God's our healer so if you got something you claim it if you need a prayer CLA keep them things in your billfold I keep four five or six brother Danny's got he
