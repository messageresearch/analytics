[0:00] good morning brother sectors today I
[0:17] don't want to talk on character
[0:19] character means as distinctive quality
[0:23] one of the attributes or features they
[0:26] make up and distinguish the individual
[0:31] brother came up here he did a good job I
[0:35] mean he didn't sugarcoat the word he
[0:37] told you what he felt so that's kind of
[0:41] like I want to do so you're firing me
[0:54] see well won't need it what it what he
[0:58] said but you know keep talking I brought
[1:01] the spirit and the message the the
[1:10] Shepherd of the sheep oh brother Barrett
[1:13] said there's three things and Minister
[1:16] has to watch for this women popularity
[1:21] and money so Sampson fell because of
[1:26] Delilah Saul fell because of his pride
[1:30] and Balaam fella because money and then
[1:34] all those things are written for our
[1:36] sample and the message got in and
[1:44] revealing simplicity for the room said a
[1:47] man was made to rely completely upon God
[1:50] that's the reason that's the reason we
[1:56] would like unto him at the Lambs of
[1:58] sheep as she cannot lead himself he has
[2:01] to
[2:02] leader and the Holy Spirit is supposed
[2:04] to be so man is made that way and God
[2:07] made all of it works so simple that the
[2:11] simple to understand it and God makes
[2:14] himself simple the simple in order to be
[2:18] understood by the simple simple simple
[2:22] [Music]
[2:25] so God in the beginning that could have
[2:28] made the son preach the gospel or wind
[2:31] preach the gospel an angel preach the
[2:34] gospel but he owed a man for that
[2:37] purpose and he never changes it he never
[2:40] again individuals he never ordained
[2:42] denominators he never ordained groups of
[2:45] men he ordained meant to preach the
[2:48] gospel not machinery mechanical devices
[2:51] or any I'm jellybeans he was man
[2:57] said God can give a man a start to do
[3:00] something and give him a ministry the
[3:03] first thing you know we'll go to Karen
[3:06] what others say and the first thing you
[3:09] know you'll be all wrapped up and a
[3:11] bunch of stuff and then God just takes
[3:14] his hat off and let him alone and the
[3:22] absolute program said God doesn't deal
[3:25] with groups of man God deals with
[3:27] individuals because man has different
[3:29] ideas he was built up and different in
[3:33] nature and God has to take that man and
[3:35] mess him Iran and for him
[3:37] Iran out of his own self - he gets
[3:41] nature and damn God deals with that
[3:44] person let's go to Galatians 6
[4:12] okay the Latian six that just read two
[4:15] to five alleged six chapter six verse 2
[4:25] there you one another's burdens and so
[4:27] fulfill the law across for the man
[4:30] thinking himself to be something when he
[4:33] is nothing he deceived himself but then
[4:37] let every man prove his veto let every
[4:41] man prove his own work and then shall he
[4:44] have rejoicing himself among and not in
[4:48] another man for every man shall bear his
[4:51] own burden I'm I'm not that God makes me
[5:00] something just like Moses most of them
[5:04] do all that miracles God did God and
[5:07] Moses so but the burning truck talks
[5:13] about people that just love themselves
[5:15] you know about neighbors ourself but
[5:17] they don't mean it that way
[5:18] me me me me so this time I get in
[5:23] trouble I say I have a I have a broken
[5:28] spirit we have some friends that go to a
[5:31] different church and they got two
[5:34] daughters they went to another Church
[5:37] and they left the church and went to a
[5:40] denomination because the preacher every
[5:43] Sunday would just preach I know
[5:46] everything you gotta do anything if you
[5:48] don't listen to me you gonna help so
[5:53] there and say you preach it on staying
[5:56] with the word you can leave and right
[6:02] I know I know we are sheep we have to be
[6:06] led by the great Shepherd and that
[6:09] fivefold ministry is like the little dog
[6:11] but sometimes he thinks God is not
[6:14] watching and he trusts to the scatter of
[6:16] the Sheep you know that little dogs
[6:18] supposed to have that help the shepherd
[6:20] hit that sheep into the bowl brother
[6:25] Brad said you cannot preach them as
[6:28] you've been with God in the back of the
[6:30] desert I'm not getting trouble here to
[6:38] some preacher need to go up to the back
[6:41] of that desert we are the body of Christ
[6:44] when one of us gets hurt
[6:46] will that's my main thing they wanna say
[6:58] well Martha thought he could do it on
[7:00] his own but God said I can't use you
[7:03] now so he sent him to the desert for 40
[7:07] years with his father-in-law Jethro
[7:11] which she was a he was a shepherd but I
[7:18] think most of what happened to could
[7:21] support let's go to Exodus for 25 to 26
[8:01] for 25 to 26
[8:09] and it came to pass by the way in in the
[8:12] end that the Lord met him and sought to
[8:14] kill him then support took a sharp stone
[8:18] and cut off the foreskin of it our son
[8:21] and tested at his feet and said surely a
[8:24] blooded husband are thou to me so I
[8:32] guess his wife kept them and kept them
[8:35] in line you said if you don't do this
[8:37] I'm gonna give you cry
[8:51] the message lead from the heart mother
[8:57] grandma said a man is known but his
[9:01] character is nobody's but his character
[9:04] is known by his works no matter who he
[9:07] is the works proof this character if you
[9:11] take the man no matter how good he tries
[9:13] to be if it's works are evil and all his
[9:16] goodness more amount to nothing a man's
[9:19] work is his character ecstasy a man that
[9:23] his word is no good then you'll never
[9:25] have a confidence in that man because it
[9:28] works no yes
[9:29] so therefore God our Father his
[9:32] character and his works prove what he is
[9:35] a man works the purse is curved for
[9:39] price was God's work in Christ the pure
[9:43] gossip character his feeling for the
[9:45] sake is longing for the same in his soul
[9:48] till even he gave his own life God the
[9:52] character was it was declared in Christ
[10:04] brother way it is in the Philippines so
[10:07] we need to pray for him but brother
[10:09] weight is one of the best preachers we
[10:11] got in the message so we won't send him
[10:13] to the back of the desert and we will
[10:14] send him to the Philippines but the
[10:25] burner said that the worst centre is the
[10:28] one that thinks he knows it all
[10:30] self-centered he said they don't need
[10:33] correction they know everything he said
[10:36] they they know it all he said you said
[10:41] their head is bigger than their stomach
[10:43] that's what he said
[10:45] but the devil doesn't need our help
[10:49] he's doing a good job brother and says
[10:53] we're helping and we're just fighting
[10:56] and shooting each other and Hebrews
[11:08] chapter 7 for to adversity it's a few
[11:13] people they saw blade temper there's
[11:15] always spotted off at the mouth at
[11:17] somebody can't put up and things like
[11:20] that be careful you killed me if you
[11:22] speak a word against your brother that's
[11:25] not right no just right go around there
[11:29] tear down tear down it you don't have to
[11:32] stick the knife in the mess back to kill
[11:34] him you say you can break this character
[11:37] and kill him kill his influence to peace
[11:40] speak against your pastor here say
[11:42] something bad about him you just might
[11:45] as well as shut him told us something it
[11:49] wasn't right about him well it'll kill
[11:52] his inference with the people and things
[11:54] like that and your
[11:55] guilty of it what Jesus said that
[11:59] brother Dale says I'll never say that
[12:01] big deal if you don't listen to me
[12:03] you're going not everybody and the
[12:12] message is LinkedIn there's so many in
[12:14] every basket there's a lot I say wait he
[12:20] one that's Bridget we got the message
[12:30] here you him back in the Old Testament
[12:34] on my father owned a big Kingdom and a
[12:37] child was born unto the king now he was
[12:39] a son as soon as he was born but yet
[12:42] that son didn't he would be here of all
[12:46] the father had his character was right
[12:48] but first his character had to be proved
[12:52] now you Minister know what I'm going to
[12:54] it's the placing of a son now this
[12:58] character didn't show up right he didn't
[13:00] inherit anything he was just a son so
[13:03] then the father in order to get this
[13:05] great stunt of his who he loved he had
[13:09] business to be doing so he got the tutor
[13:13] trainer or his children a stop to the
[13:15] places until he found the best man he
[13:18] could find because his son's education
[13:20] and the future of his son depended on
[13:23] what kind of training that shall God and
[13:26] that's the way it is today in the
[13:28] kingdom of God that we were born the
[13:31] kingdom of God God sought the best tool
[13:35] that he could find for the church and
[13:37] there was a holy spirit life is what
[13:41] controls us we are known by the life
[13:44] that we live and has been said that your
[13:46] life speak so loud that I can't hear you
[13:49] you're testing on
[13:51] testamental so therefore to live a
[13:53] sermon would be much better than to
[13:55] preach one life you live shows what
[13:59] character you are because your life
[14:01] always builds your
[14:02] character and Jesus said by the truth
[14:05] you shall know them so no matter what we
[14:08] would say or how much we always tested
[14:10] by if our life doesn't concern
[14:13] concededly that testimony we're doing
[14:16] the kingdom of God and then dead men by
[14:19] giving that testimony because people
[14:22] know what we are and I often thought
[14:26] that a funeral service to hear men
[14:28] preached the funeral of a some person
[14:30] that had live ungodly and had never done
[14:33] anything right and yet preachers though
[14:35] they were a great person they had done
[14:38] that gone right into heaven and the end
[14:47] time Angela's brother and said Jesus
[14:49] comes characters not members you know
[14:51] that becomes character God always tries
[14:55] to get one man and he's had that that's
[14:57] all you need is one man and he will do
[15:00] his work through the you know just think
[15:02] you can only find one righteous man in
[15:05] the time I know in the time my motives
[15:08] he only found one righteous man he said
[15:13] God looking for character not membership
[15:15] character early years old when he went
[15:18] to get the product for Isaac he sweated
[15:21] it out until he found character Abraham
[15:24] put him responsible as God puts us
[15:27] responsible right we ministers taught my
[15:32] bride god bless your heart I'm looking
[15:34] for members I'm looking for the pure in
[15:37] heart see somebody they'll believe in
[15:41] the world no question no comment
[15:51] identification now but we find that
[15:55] there as we've gone through life that
[15:57] our character multi-image that we are
[16:00] each one knows that as you live your
[16:03] character wants you to what you are now
[16:06] you have seen people that you just love
[16:08] to be around yet they might not be
[16:10] accepting your bracket of society and
[16:13] again there might be a different race
[16:16] color or the brown of the yellow but
[16:19] there there's just something about that
[16:22] character you just have to be in their
[16:24] presence because it's person is the
[16:27] diamond on the line that their own and
[16:31] you put out an atmosphere
[16:47] let's go to Roman's 14
[17:09] there's 240 11 to 13
[17:22] we're almost 40 level 13
[17:34] positive rhythm as I live saith the LORD
[17:37] every knee shall bow to me and every
[17:39] tongue shall confess to God so then
[17:42] every one of us shall give account of
[17:45] himself to God that is there now
[17:48] therefore just just one another anymore
[17:51] by judgment rather that no man put a
[17:54] stumbling-block or an occasion to Paul
[17:57] and his brothers way
[18:09] let's go to Hebrews six
[18:24] here for six first one that's it
[18:29] they're for the living therefore leaving
[18:31] the principles of the doctrine of Christ
[18:33] less let us go on to perfection not
[18:36] laying again the foundation of
[18:39] repentance from dead works in a faith
[18:41] toward God I heard a news and confirmed
[19:01] that they had had some robust stocking
[19:03] up shelves you know and one of them had
[19:06] a short and he caught a bit he caught
[19:09] out of it I mean he started a bit
[19:10] farther so when the firemen came in then
[19:16] a lot of time because the robots kept
[19:18] working and the CEO so no matter what
[19:34] what the devil throws at us we got to
[19:36] stand our ground a brother gonna say
[19:38] we've got to stand their ground like the
[19:41] robots did so it often let go if only
[19:45] one out of George's it's going that you
[19:48] say you you not save me so let's be like
[19:53] the world no matter what that okay let's
[20:03] go to Luke chapter sit and this was not
[20:06] the I need all the help of a responsive
[20:11] reading sixth
[20:18] look six we're going to start with 20
[20:22] all the way to 46 and why have the
[20:25] attitude
[20:33] 6:28 and he lifted up his eyes on his
[20:37] disciple and said let's be poor for
[20:40] yours is the kingdom of God let us are
[20:53] you when men shall hate you and wish
[20:56] they shall separate you from their
[20:58] company and you shall we shall reproach
[21:01] you and cast out your name as evil for
[21:04] the son of man's sake you have received
[21:25] your constant constellation all unto you
[21:41] and all men shall speak well of you for
[21:44] so did your fathers to the false
[21:46] prophets but them that curse you and
[21:57] pray for them which despitefully the
[22:01] spicy
[22:15] after every man that asks of me and of
[22:18] him and take it away thank good dying
[22:22] good ask them not again my eyes for if
[22:33] you know that we love you what thank
[22:35] have ye for sinners sinners also love
[22:38] those who love them and if you lend to
[22:52] them of whom you hope to receive what
[22:55] they gave you for sinners also lend to
[22:58] sinners to receive as much again
[23:19] therefore merciful as your father also
[23:22] is merciful
[23:33] for heaven given it shall be given unto
[23:36] you good measure pressure down and
[23:39] shaken together and running over shall
[23:42] men give unto you men give unto your
[23:47] bosom for with the same measure that we
[23:50] eat meat we all it shall be measured to
[23:54] you again and then why made that one
[24:04] the disciple is not above his master but
[24:08] everyone there is per feet shall be as
[24:11] his master
[24:22] you hope tennis thou say to thy brother
[24:26] brother they pull up in remote that is
[24:30] then the high when not thyself of the
[24:33] oldest not that beam that is in thine
[24:35] own eye hypocrite test up that first
[24:40] beam out of thine own eye and then shalt
[24:43] thou see clearly to pull up them Moulton
[24:46] is in thy brother's eye boy
[25:26] [Music]
[25:30] precisely
[25:46] and the message why Christ speak brother
[25:49] said God goes to church every day just
[25:53] yes just lives in church even if the
[25:56] church he lives and just you you're his
[25:58] church
[25:59] you're his truth you are the tabernacle
[26:02] that God dwells in your the Church of
[26:05] the Living God yourself and then living
[26:07] God lives in his living being then your
[26:10] actions is of God if it isn't that God
[26:14] isn't there he won't make you act like
[26:17] that when he says and his work here his
[26:21] blueprint don't don't do it and you go
[26:24] do it
[26:25] see that's wrong when you deny it it
[26:28] showed that the life isn't even in you
[26:36] the water of separation program said
[26:38] products had to die to make us all alive
[26:41] freaking us is that right so it's only
[26:46] through no matter what church do you
[26:48] belong to how many times you shook hand
[26:50] with a preacher how many how many names
[26:53] you got in the book or how many churches
[26:55] you belong to it doesn't mean that
[26:58] you've got to absolutely accept the
[27:01] death of the Lord Jesus Christ and not
[27:03] only that but you got to die to yourself
[27:06] you got to die to every thought of the
[27:09] fish that you can receive their mind of
[27:12] Christ and walk from henceforth not of
[27:15] your own but of his mind the mind of
[27:18] Christ in you that's the only way you
[27:21] can stay alive that's the only way I can
[27:24] stay alive that's all a little part is
[27:27] by the Holy Spirit
[27:33] and the influence brother I'm said
[27:36] remember the Bible said you're living
[27:38] written officials made of old man now
[27:42] many people won't read the Bible but God
[27:45] has made you live in the representative
[27:48] you're a walking letter should you be a
[27:52] walking Bible of Christ in you you
[27:54] should be the walking one of God and if
[27:57] you profess to be a Christian and not
[27:59] that you're influenced what your infant
[28:03] sent will make you have to answer for
[28:06] many stones that you turn aside away
[28:09] from the crowd from Christ in that
[28:12] Judgment Day
[28:32] whatever whatever happens in your life
[28:34] you can change her you can change your
[28:39] attitude what Joseph's brothers did dip
[28:45] to him there were that was pretty bad so
[28:48] but Joseph chose the right attitude they
[28:52] say God did this to preserve life so
[28:55] when his brothers finally recognized
[28:57] what he said
[28:58] we're toast Joseph Joseph changes
[29:04] attitude there's three steps to join
[29:27] first one is Jesus others and you last
[29:42] so he must increase
[29:44] we must decrease but everybody says they
[29:49] put upside down big brother jeepers we
[29:54] have a guy at my work
[29:56] oh yeah I'm a team player yeah right
[30:00] [Laughter]
[30:11] [Music]
[30:13] they don't want us to find our place no
[30:16] more they don't once they made I guess
[30:22] crazy you're talking about our character
[30:31] and that's what you started out with and
[30:33] power character is molded and I may be
[30:36] silly but I think of a jello mold
[30:39] everybody seen your jello mold
[30:41] yeah what if you put in Cool Whip jello
[30:46] and nuts and maybe help me fruit there
[30:49] we go
[30:50] and you leave it on the counter yeah
[30:51] what happened okay nothing but you have
[30:55] to put it in the right atmosphere right
[30:57] to change what all right inside there
[30:59] now you can take those thing and then
[31:01] you have a different outcome depending
[31:02] on if you put it in the freezer or the
[31:04] refrigerator or anything yeah so it's
[31:08] it's where you are did your attitude
[31:10] where you go but you can take the same
[31:12] mold and put pure water in it and put it
[31:16] in the same you have you have your
[31:18] choice again we have the water of the
[31:20] word you have your choice again you can
[31:22] leave it in the Sun you can leave it on
[31:24] the counter or you can put it in the
[31:25] refrigerator the freezer and it changes
[31:27] one of these but it's still a cycle
[31:29] anymore it's still the same ingredients
[31:31] but it changes the character right of
[31:33] what you take out of that mold you can
[31:34] dump it out liquid or you can leave it
[31:36] in there and turn it into something else
[31:38] it was alright the atmosphere there
[31:41] so it's kind of silly yeah I was in the
[31:44] kitchen too long I guess but oh yeah
[31:54] [Music]
