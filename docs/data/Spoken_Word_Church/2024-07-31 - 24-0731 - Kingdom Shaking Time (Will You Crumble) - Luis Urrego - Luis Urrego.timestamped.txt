[10:39] Father we just commit the rest of the
[10:41] service into your hands in Jesus
[10:43] Christ's name amen amen praise the Lord
[10:46] Jesus let's turn to the book of Hebrews
[10:49] Hebrews chapter
[10:50] 12
[10:52] um and
[10:55] uh and uh we can we can read along here
[11:01] if you if you don't have your Bible
[11:04] there but Hebrews chapter 12 and started
[11:08] in verse 14 and it says follow peace
[11:12] with all man and Holiness without which
[11:15] no man shall see the
[11:18] Lord um you know sometimes we have we
[11:21] might be in situations where we can't
[11:22] have peace with people or where peace
[11:25] might not be there but we try to follow
[11:28] peace as much as and sometimes that may
[11:31] mean you know not not having to maybe
[11:34] just not just maybe sometimes avoiding
[11:37] them just for the sake of Peace you know
[11:40] that that's that's sometimes what you
[11:42] have to do you know but but we usually
[11:44] try to talk things out and and uh but
[11:47] sometimes you know some sometimes people
[11:49] you just can't there's no other way to
[11:51] do that but to just leave them
[11:53] alone but says follow peace in other
[11:56] words seek after it follow peace with
[11:58] all man and Holiness without which no
[12:01] man shall see the Lord look and
[12:03] diligently lest any man fail of the
[12:06] grace of God lest any root of bitterness
[12:09] springing up trouble you and thereby
[12:13] many be defiled see and then we skip
[12:16] down to verse 25 see that ye refuse not
[12:20] him that speaketh for if they escaped
[12:23] not who refused him that spake on Earth
[12:26] much more shall not we escape if we turn
[12:29] away from him that speaketh from Heaven
[12:32] whose voice then shook the
[12:34] Earth but now he hath promise saying yet
[12:38] once more I not only shake the Earth or
[12:41] I shake not the Earth only but also
[12:43] heaven and this word yet once more
[12:47] signifieth the removing of those things
[12:49] that are shaken as of things that are
[12:52] made that those things which cannot be
[12:55] shaken May remain praise the Lord amen
[12:59] and
[13:00] um and then it continues here saying
[13:03] wherefore we receiving a kingdom which
[13:06] cannot be moved let us have Grace
[13:09] whereby we may serve God acceptably with
[13:12] reverence and godly fear for our God is
[13:16] a consuming fire praise the Lord Jesus
[13:18] you may be seated this this evening amen
[13:22] i' just like to quickly speak to you
[13:25] about Kingdom shaking time and the
[13:27] question is will you cry
[13:29] crumble will you crumble were you or or
[13:33] will the holy ghost that you have in you
[13:35] will it cause you to stand amen how many
[13:39] believe that we're in shaken Kingdom
[13:40] time how many believe that kingdoms
[13:43] around the world are being shaken and as
[13:46] kingdoms around the world are being
[13:48] shaken all believe also the bride of
[13:51] Christ is also being shaken too amen we
[13:54] are being shaken we're feeling the
[13:56] elements all around us we're feeling the
[13:58] the the the pressures all around us
[14:01] we're feeling the the the the the things
[14:03] that are taking place not just
[14:05] politically not just uh uh but also
[14:07] definitely spiritually amen because uh
[14:10] we are in a shaking Kingdom time amen
[14:14] and you and I we're supposed to be
[14:16] kingdoms of the kingdom of God supposed
[14:17] to be reigning inside of you and me amen
[14:20] how many believe that by the by the by
[14:22] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that is
[14:25] the kingdom of God Amen the kingdom of
[14:28] God is not something that you look at
[14:30] you know it's not like the a far away
[14:32] Kingdom you know or or or something like
[14:34] that eventually it will come to that it
[14:37] will come to a physical Kingdom but it
[14:39] has to be a spiritual Kingdom first amen
[14:43] because those things that you see that
[14:45] you don't see amen usually those are the
[14:46] things that usually stand amen and God
[14:50] Amen he we we may not see him uh
[14:53] physically amen but if he's in you amen
[14:56] he's he's more than he's he's powerful
[14:58] enough Amen to cause the a work in your
[15:01] in in your life amen and and we manifest
[15:04] on the outside what he's doing on the
[15:06] inside amen praise the Lord Jesus but we
[15:08] know that and we see that Satan amen is
[15:11] is moving in in the last days that we're
[15:13] living
[15:14] in and if if you don't if you don't
[15:16] believe that we're not living in the end
[15:18] time then then then you just love the
[15:20] world too
[15:21] much that's all I got to say you you
[15:24] you're you're just too stuck on the
[15:26] world we we we we really see the the the
[15:29] the the things is Fallen apart and then
[15:32] and and and I believe that it's causing
[15:34] and it's drawing us Amen to to seek Amen
[15:37] to to to Long amen for that body change
[15:40] to long for the resurrection of the
[15:42] Saints amen those promises of God that
[15:44] we're looking for amen that that they're
[15:46] they're just as real amen as I'm
[15:48] standing here amen you Satan might tell
[15:51] you well you know
[15:53] what a resurrection all the saints the
[15:56] the people that you know are going to
[15:58] come up and it might sound like a fairy
[16:00] tale but amen our head went through it
[16:03] first amen and if he came up amen those
[16:07] Saints are coming up as well amen praise
[16:09] the Lord Jesus so so the question is is
[16:13] will you crumble in the middle of the
[16:14] shaking amen and um I really didn't mean
[16:17] to make this uh like a a video slide I
[16:21] meant to make it like a but uh anyways
[16:24] it is what it is all right
[16:27] so uh here in Hebrews 12 we just read in
[16:31] verse 28 wherefore we receiving a
[16:33] kingdom which cannot be moved amen
[16:37] praise God you should be excited amen
[16:39] and happy that the fact that the kingdom
[16:41] that you have received inside of you
[16:44] amen is eternal amen amen that's the
[16:47] reason why you have eternal life and
[16:49] it's a kingdom that cannot be moved
[16:52] praise God Amen that's the reason why it
[16:55] continues to say let us have Grace
[16:57] whereby we may serve God acceptably with
[17:00] reverence and godly fear amen we uh I
[17:04] mean we are in the age of Grace and and
[17:06] and and double double Grace praise the
[17:09] Lord Jesus and I believe that we should
[17:10] show Grace not just us receiving Grace
[17:13] but also show Grace to those if we're
[17:17] we're supposed to be gracious people
[17:19] amen amen praise God we're supposed to
[17:21] be we're supposed to be the most
[17:23] gracious people because God has shown
[17:27] double Grace to us and I'm so thankful
[17:29] for that amen the grace that he shown us
[17:32] whereby we may serve God acceptably with
[17:36] reverence and godly fear amen for our
[17:39] God is a consuming fire you know when we
[17:42] were there in Honduras I I spoke to the
[17:44] young people uh one one of the the last
[17:47] service that we had there for the Youth
[17:49] the youth camp and I talked to them
[17:51] about the the fire of God Amen and how
[17:54] the fire how it was the priests that
[17:57] would light the uh they would take the
[17:59] fire of God inside the the the the
[18:02] duties of the priest when they would
[18:03] light the C the the SE the seven
[18:05] candlesticks and all that it had to be
[18:08] the fire of God Amen it couldn't be
[18:10] their own fire and and it couldn't be
[18:13] strange fire it had to be the fire of
[18:16] God and and we know that one time
[18:18] Aaron's oldest Sons they they lit
[18:20] Strange Fire in other words they did
[18:23] things the way they thought maybe it
[18:26] should be done well God gave us a a a
[18:29] recipe of how to do certain things but
[18:32] but they did it their own way and
[18:33] instantly God had to had to had to kill
[18:36] them right on the spot right later on we
[18:39] might we if you continue reading it was
[18:41] possible that they were a little tipsy
[18:43] if you you call it that way they were
[18:46] drunk and later in that chapter the Lord
[18:50] gives Commandments to the priest to not
[18:52] be drinking and get drunk before they do
[18:54] their duties and that's the reason why
[18:57] they were offering uh they offered
[18:59] Strange Fire so that is why we need to
[19:02] be sober in the m in the in the hour
[19:04] that we're living in amen sober minded
[19:07] and and and and know what you believe
[19:09] and know what what who the God that you
[19:11] are serving amen know what you are doing
[19:14] amen and do the things according to his
[19:17] word amen not do it according to your
[19:19] opinion or add one thing in there and
[19:21] and take one thing out amen but do it
[19:24] exactly as God said and you will see the
[19:26] results that God said you will have I
[19:28] believe that with all my heart and so
[19:30] that's why that's why here in Hebrews it
[19:33] says for in Hebrews uh verse 29 12 for
[19:36] our God is a consuming fire amen amen
[19:40] when he I hope he's consumed you amen
[19:43] and I hope he continues to consume you
[19:45] amen praise God I want him to consume me
[19:48] amen I I I don't I don't want to be
[19:49] living I I want him to live through me
[19:51] amen praise the
[19:53] Lord amen so so we see um we could just
[19:58] go look back in in in different in
[20:00] different ages and and we can see how
[20:03] the you know different Empires and I
[20:06] have here that uh the Roman Empire it
[20:09] was one of the empires that uh was that
[20:13] had expanded themselves worldwide and
[20:16] and but one of the these are some of the
[20:19] the failures that they had that they
[20:21] could they did not continue I mean I
[20:23] know I know we we know that Rome is
[20:24] still there
[20:25] spiritually uh that that that that that
[20:29] um that wound amen they came back up
[20:31] again overextend but this were some of
[20:34] the things that that the reason why they
[20:35] failed was overextension corruption
[20:39] external pressures and economic troubles
[20:42] led to its
[20:43] decline amen I wonder if we're seeing
[20:45] the same thing in the in the United
[20:47] States nowadays we we're heading the
[20:49] same direction amen and I and I just
[20:52] hope that you and I are not are not just
[20:54] falling falling head over heels over
[20:58] this political iCal
[20:59] stuff because it's is is leading to the
[21:03] mark of the beast if believe it or not
[21:05] it's really what it's doing amen this
[21:08] this Empire was too large to
[21:10] manage and and and internal conflicts
[21:14] weakened its
[21:15] foundations amen so they had bickering
[21:18] and fighting and fussing amongst each
[21:20] other they couldn't fully get along has
[21:23] what we see here in in in in in our
[21:25] political Realms today am man just
[21:27] bickering and fighting each other and uh
[21:30] and and when you're doing that amen it
[21:32] weakens you it weakens you amen and it
[21:36] causes you Amen to for those things to
[21:38] be hindrances for you to me to to to
[21:41] move forward so the Roman Empire didn't
[21:43] continue and they probably they probably
[21:45] thought that that that Empire and that
[21:47] Kingdom could never be shaken amen that
[21:50] that Kingdom would always stand that
[21:52] that Kingdom would always be there we'll
[21:54] always have a Caesar we'll always have
[21:56] somebody to rule us but eventually God
[21:59] is the one who has the final word amen
[22:01] and we know the Roman Empire could
[22:03] didn't last but just just just think
[22:07] about it amen corruption and internal
[22:10] conflicts and and and and and weakened
[22:13] their foundations
[22:16] amen we also see it in the the the
[22:19] Persian Empire from 550 BC to 651 ad the
[22:24] conquest it was it failed because of
[22:26] conquest by the Arabs internal division
[22:29] same
[22:30] thing internal divisions and economic
[22:34] troubles led to its decline the empire
[22:37] was weakened by constant Wars and
[22:40] regionalism amen in other words you know
[22:43] I I'm just they're not we're not
[22:46] satisfied with just their portion we
[22:48] want more and more and more and more and
[22:51] the more you get the more you want if
[22:54] God is not in it amen so we see that the
[22:56] Persian Empire they fail they fail the
[22:58] same same way and and um Babylon the
[23:02] Babylonian Empire conquest by the
[23:04] Persians again internal divisions and
[23:08] economic troubles led to its Decline and
[23:11] the empire was weakened by constant Wars
[23:14] so I I'm so glad that this that this
[23:17] Kingdom we're just reading about amen is
[23:19] an eternal Kingdom and it cannot it
[23:21] cannot fall amen praise the lord it's a
[23:23] kingdom that God Amen established amen
[23:26] and and it's a perfect Kingdom praise
[23:28] the Lord Jesus it's a kingdom that uh
[23:31] that's the reason why it's so important
[23:32] for you and I to receive the Holy Ghost
[23:34] in This our day amen praise God so
[23:38] brother brandham brother brandham says
[23:40] here and this is a little lengthy but
[23:41] you just bear with
[23:43] me it says in the message the Fallen
[23:46] apart of the world now over in the book
[23:48] of the Hebrews we read a while ago for
[23:50] we receive a kingdom not receive a Creed
[23:53] not receive a system we receive a
[23:56] kingdom that cannot not be moved the
[24:00] world is Fallen apart and you know and
[24:03] if you go back and reading these
[24:04] messages and listen to this messag that
[24:06] brother brandham preached the Fallen
[24:08] apart of the world or the world is
[24:09] Fallen apart brother brandham brother
[24:12] brandham talks about how in that day
[24:16] people were looking for a
[24:18] messiah you know just like in the day of
[24:20] the of the Jews uh uh during the time of
[24:24] Jesus they were looking for a messiah
[24:26] they were looking for the Messiah to
[24:28] come in and stump out the Romans and to
[24:31] and and to uh bring peace and and bring
[24:35] order the order that they thought things
[24:37] should be amen amongst them and and and
[24:40] here it was again in n in the 1960s and
[24:43] and the world yet again was falling
[24:45] apart and what was the world looking for
[24:47] during that time and it was Christmas
[24:50] time usually when brother Brandon would
[24:51] preach this message and what were they
[24:54] looking for they were looking for a
[24:55] messiah they were looking for someone to
[24:58] come in and and and and restore peace
[25:01] again and bring things back the way they
[25:03] were back in 2016 17 18
[25:10] 19 and you know we ain't going back to
[25:13] that God has you here amen because he's
[25:16] he's got to have Overcomers in this
[25:19] time amen things aren't going back PR
[25:23] 2016 2017 amen things are going to be
[25:27] the things things are being shaken amen
[25:30] where where are you putting your
[25:31] confidence in amen is it the word of God
[25:34] is the word of God so important to you
[25:36] amen or or or or is or is the political
[25:39] process more more much more important to
[25:41] you amen
[25:43] right you don't live with those
[25:46] candidates neither do I so you don't
[25:49] know what what what if they're saying
[25:51] one thing out of their mouth and well
[25:52] how they live behind the scenes they all
[25:55] got skeletons in their closet and they
[25:57] all have allegiances to other things and
[25:59] other people amen other than the United
[26:01] States I'm afraid I'm afraid to say that
[26:05] so so uh uh this this this this thing is
[26:09] is what people think that there's
[26:10] somebody that's going to come in amen
[26:12] but Jesus Christ has already set he is
[26:14] our Messiah amen he is our conqueror he
[26:18] is the one that we need the problem is
[26:20] is that we don't want him amen we we
[26:23] want our own thing we want our own our
[26:25] own uh flavor of Peace we want our own
[26:28] flavor of of Joy amen when God has given
[26:31] us joy through his word god provides joy
[26:34] and peace through his word amen and and
[26:37] and that's what that's the kingdom amen
[26:38] that you must receive and and that's the
[26:40] only Kingdom that will stand praise God
[26:43] so brother Brown continues saying here
[26:45] not receive a Creed not receive a system
[26:47] we receive a kingdom that cannot be
[26:49] moved the world is Fallen apart that's
[26:52] true and every politician every
[26:55] denomination and every church will fall
[26:58] to two pieces amen amen e every oh you
[27:03] say well that was just in the 1960s
[27:05] every every every that's
[27:08] 2024 but we receive a kingdom that
[27:11] cannot be moved for if they who rejected
[27:14] him who spoke from Mount Si and the
[27:18] Earth shook beneath his voice how much
[27:21] more see that you don't reject who him
[27:24] his word that speaks from heaven from
[27:26] his kingdom for We Are are in a kingdom
[27:29] that cannot be moved amen how many
[27:32] believe that praise the Lord Jesus we
[27:35] are in a kingdom that cannot be moved
[27:37] but that Kingdom has to be inside of you
[27:39] first praise
[27:41] God Amen and I like what he says here
[27:44] and I put this title at the top that God
[27:46] made it fragile so it would
[27:48] break you mean God made it that way so
[27:51] it would break yeah amen God made it
[27:55] fragile amen so that you can long for
[27:57] something that
[27:59] stronger amen praise God because when
[28:01] the kingdom of God is inside of you amen
[28:03] you long for a true Kingdom amen when
[28:06] the true kingdom of God is inside of you

[28:48] I'm I'm voting for The
[28:50] Lamb amen praise God he's the one that
[28:53] that that's done it all for me
[28:55] everything that's outside of that God
[28:57] sent everything he made it fragile watch
[29:00] he says he made it fragile so it would
[29:03] break so it would break Amen in its
[29:07] fragile condition like that it's got to
[29:10] break you want to say you know we know
[29:13] that this Earth and we know that the
[29:15] world Amen is is the cosmos is some
[29:19] really awesome stuff there that God
[29:21] created amen you know and it's it's it's
[29:26] strong you know and it's and it's it's
[29:28] it's it's um you can just see the the
[29:31] hand of the the hand of God in it Amen
[29:35] brother brandom even said that
[29:37] scientists can't even explain a blade of
[29:41] grass and and and so it it's it's the
[29:45] the the the mind of God in order to
[29:47] create these things and how how low can
[29:50] man get to say that there is no God that
[29:52] there is no intelligence behind the
[29:55] things that we see and as there saying
[29:58] that their their their own heart is
[30:00] beating and their their blood is pumping
[30:02] through their body and their brain is
[30:04] functioning and and and and and all the
[30:07] functions in their body that they're
[30:08] they're not even aware of and yet
[30:11] they're blaspheming God at the same time
[30:13] amen and they have no control of praise
[30:15] God Amen but yet in in all its
[30:19] Perfection the the the the the because
[30:22] we know that God created it perfect but
[30:24] right now the the the earth and the is
[30:27] the creation is groaning for the
[30:29] manifestation of the sons of God that
[30:32] means there's something that's out of
[30:33] cater amen amen that means that that
[30:36] that something that they're Desiring
[30:37] that was there at one point amen but but
[30:41] but we are coming to that place amen and
[30:44] so but uh Peter and and different people
[30:48] in in the scriptures they talked about
[30:50] how these elements and all these things
[30:52] they were going to melt amen and now
[30:54] this world is going to be is going to be
[30:56] shaken and this and everything is going
[30:58] to be burnt with fervent heat so it's
[31:02] fragile God created it that way amen but
[31:06] there's coming a there's coming a a a
[31:09] new Heaven and a new Earth amen and I
[31:12] believe that one amen is going to
[31:13] represent the kingdom of God that's in
[31:15] you amen praise God he made it fragile
[31:19] so it would break and it's fragile
[31:21] condition like that it's got to break
[31:24] it's fragile but remember that we got a
[31:27] kingdom that's solid now amen amen how
[31:31] many can read that maybe that's the the
[31:33] words are too jumbled up together we got
[31:36] a kingdom that's solid now amen amen
[31:39] praise God you have to have confidence
[31:41] in the Holy Ghost that God gave you amen
[31:43] that it's going to lead you Amen to the
[31:45] other side amen that it's going to
[31:48] produce amen what what it promised that
[31:50] it would produce and it's going to
[31:52] finish the work that he started in you
[31:55] amen when everything else Falls and
[31:58] gives
[31:59] way when everything else Falls and gives
[32:02] way no wonder Eddie perinet said on
[32:04] Christ the solid rock I stand all other
[32:07] grounds is sinking sand amen a kingdom
[32:12] not a polit a political system not a
[32:15] political system not a church not a
[32:18] denominational system it all becomes
[32:21] Pharisees and doctors of the devil amen
[32:24] amen but we receive a kingdom an eternal
[32:27] kingom
[32:28] right who is the Eternal Word who has
[32:31] eternal life by his Eternal Word to his
[32:34] eternal people who has eternal life and
[32:37] we're partakers of this oh my that
[32:39] that's the thing praise the Lord Jesus
[32:42] amen so it's all eternal life amen
[32:45] praise God and the more you read of the
[32:46] word and the more you feed yourself in
[32:48] the word amen the more of that eternal
[32:50] life you're partaking in amen the more
[32:53] of that word you're becoming like amen
[32:56] praise the Lord Jesus amen but if we if
[32:59] if if we're getting distracted by other
[33:01] things and we're allowing those things
[33:03] Amen to feed us amen then we then don't
[33:08] don't don't uh don't wonder why you're
[33:11] are getting upset and why you're on
[33:14] Facebook arguing about
[33:17] politics and how and how and how Camala
[33:20] Harris could be the the the the the the
[33:24] the the Whatchamacallit the she's uh
[33:28] fulfilling that the prophecy you know
[33:31] and and all that we don't know that and
[33:35] so you you have to you have to uh you
[33:38] you have to just stay amen with what you
[33:41] know we you know you you you have to
[33:44] stick with what God didn't show us
[33:46] everything amen so you you can't affirm
[33:49] every single thing that you see is yeah
[33:51] yeah that's it and then that's what they
[33:53] were saying about
[33:54] Hillary and then that's what they were
[33:56] saying again about back in when when
[33:59] Biden got and and so forth amen so we
[34:03] have to amen just stick with what the
[34:05] word says amen stay with stay with what
[34:08] you know amen stay with what God has
[34:10] given us and God eventually amen will
[34:12] amen will F un unfold his plan praise
[34:15] God you just roll with
[34:17] it you just roll with the plan of God
[34:20] and don't let those things worry you
[34:21] amen because if God wanted you to know
[34:23] exactly who it was amen if we were going
[34:26] to have a woman president then he would
[34:28] have told us and he would have had a
[34:31] purpose to do so amen but he did not not
[34:35] through his Prophet amen so it really
[34:38] didn't didn't go it wasn't in God's mind
[34:41] to do so amen so it shouldn't be in your
[34:44] mind to wonder amen if if it is or not
[34:47] amen praise the Lord
[34:49] Jesus and and so and so we if we just
[34:52] stick if we stick with with the word
[34:54] amen and stick on what on on those
[34:56] things amen it'll take as far praise the
[34:58] Lord Jesus am man I'm not going to be
[35:00] too long tonight because I also want to
[35:02] give the little report amen about
[35:05] Honduras so brother Brandon continues
[35:08] here now anything that pulls you away
[35:11] from that is
[35:13] wrong and what is that that Eternal
[35:17] Kingdom amen that's what he was talking
[35:20] about because this is this quote
[35:21] continued anything that pulls you away
[35:23] from that is wrong anything that pulls
[35:26] you away to go argue on
[35:30] Facebook anything that pulls you away
[35:32] Amen to um you know they got Trump now
[35:35] almost at Jesus Christ status
[35:37] now it's
[35:39] sad it's it's it's it really is a cult
[35:43] if you think about
[35:44] it because because you know and and and
[35:48] his and his in his uh assassination
[35:52] attempt that really elevated his uh his
[35:56] popularity and that's what they wanted
[35:57] that they wanted this reaction they
[35:59] wanted this for whatever reason I don't
[36:03] but but but just be careful I just say
[36:06] be careful I say it in the name of the
[36:08] Lord Jesus Christ stay in the word amen
[36:11] I'm not I'm not democrat or republican
[36:13] amen but but uh you look you look more
[36:16] into Trump's life he's not what he says
[36:18] he is I'll just tell you that right now
[36:22] and so you you you you you'll easily
[36:25] fall for something amen and then you
[36:27] start leaving the word of God Amen and
[36:30] and then that thing fails you and then
[36:32] you realize where have what have I done
[36:35] I I did not stay with the word amen it
[36:38] sounds holy and even if it sounds good
[36:41] and it sounds just right and amen but if
[36:44] if it does anything that pulls you away
[36:46] from that from that kingdom is wrong
[36:49] brother brandham said that's a false
[36:52] Messiah he said that's right a false
[36:55] anointing amen amen oh oh he said the
[36:58] brother had such anointing what kind of
[37:01] anointing that's it Hitler had an
[37:04] anointing too amen kusbs got one also
[37:08] Pope Pas has one also what kind of
[37:12] anointing you got if it's not Anointed
[37:16] with this word and vindicate every word
[37:18] to be truth leave it alone right amen
[37:21] I'm not telling you to go not go vote
[37:24] you know that's not what brother Brandon
[37:25] was telling you amen amen but if it's
[37:29] leading you Amen to the wrong thing amen
[37:31] leave it alone there's things in this
[37:34] life amen that they might not
[37:35] necessarily be
[37:37] wrong that's not
[37:40] necessarily
[37:41] fishing you know it's not wrong amen but
[37:47] if it causes you Amen to to to to miss
[37:50] church then you're missing the
[37:54] kingdom fishing is not wrong amen
[37:58] other things in life are are are are are
[38:01] not wrong you know you know that I just
[38:03] speak plain so I I just there's other
[38:06] things in this life that are not wrong
[38:08] amen but if it's causing you to fail the
[38:11] Mark if it's causing you to to to to
[38:13] pull you away from that Kingdom amen
[38:17] then it's
[38:18] wrong amen praise God so it's what you
[38:22] allow in your life to cause you to to to
[38:26] change your attitudes toward people to
[38:28] cause you to change your your the way
[38:32] you you you you you uh talk to God and
[38:35] read his word and and the way you start
[38:38] looking at other people because let me
[38:40] tell you politics
[38:43] divide it does the word
[38:46] unites politics divide and if you're
[38:49] falling in for that trap amen of
[38:51] politics amen you're becoming just as
[38:54] corrupt and as rotten as brother
[38:55] brandham said those things are right
[38:58] and don't get mad at me cuz brother
[38:59] Brandon was the one who talked about
[39:00] those things first amen it's so sad that
[39:03] people are falling for such a disgrace
[39:05] is that thinking that their their their
[39:07] Messiah amen is going to their Messiah
[39:10] is going to save them from all this amen
[39:12] when you know amen that it's this thing
[39:15] has to fall
[39:16] apart amen it's got to amen it's time
[39:20] it's time for us to go home amen praise
[39:23] the Lord Jesus I I want to go home amen
[39:26] and I you know what whatever needs to
[39:28] happen amen it's just to fulfill the
[39:30] word of God amen amen but I don't want
[39:32] to fall in line amen with those that
[39:34] those same anointings amen Pope P has
[39:37] had an anointing also what kind of
[39:39] anointing do you have if it's not
[39:41] Anointed with this word and vindicate
[39:44] every word to be truth leave it alone
[39:47] wrong if it don't produce itself then it
[39:50] isn't deratization
[39:57] they showing its color now oh say but
[40:00] that was for another age amen we leave
[40:03] that thing Alone brother Brandon said
[40:05] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[40:08] and forever you may be saying you know
[40:10] well he was just talking about spiritual
[40:12] things but again we go back if there's
[40:15] something physical that's that's pulling
[40:17] you away from the spiritual then leave
[40:19] it
[40:20] alone amen if it's something out here
[40:23] Amen in the cosmos amen that's pulling
[40:25] you away from the spiritual then it is
[40:27] something something spiritual leave it
[40:28] alone amen you have allowed it in your
[40:31] life to become spiritual then leave it
[40:33] alone praise the Lord
[40:37] amen all
[40:40] right and and so with with this I I'll
[40:44] I'll I'll I'll finish this is the last
[40:45] slide before we get to the Honduras STP
[40:49] so when this world falls apart we are
[40:51] born into a kingdom that cannot fall
[40:54] apart amen I'm so thankful for that amen
[40:57] amen a kingdom that cannot be shaken
[41:00] amen so that is why amen if you have
[41:04] that Kingdom in you amen you cannot be
[41:06] shake you will be shaken but you will
[41:08] not
[41:09] crumble amen the pressures will come and
[41:14] and let me tell you it won't be just one
[41:17] amen it'll be it'll there's going to be
[41:20] more pressures personally in your in
[41:22] your life they are coming down the road
[41:25] because God has to shake everything out
[41:28] of us that's not supposed to be there
[41:30] amen that's not part of his word he's
[41:32] got to shake it off any unbelief amen no
[41:35] unbelief will go in praise God Amen
[41:38] therefore we got to have the pressures
[41:40] that we have in life and the and the
[41:42] shakings have to come in order for us to
[41:45] be to to uh to be full of that perfect
[41:48] love amen praise
[41:51] God so when this world falls apart we
[41:53] are born into a kingdom that cannot fall
[41:55] apart you believe the world is falling
[41:57] falling apart brother bam mass and that
[42:00] was in this was in
[42:03] 1962 is uh more than 50 years ago amen
[42:07] imagine the things out

[42:13] apart amen but but young people amen you
[42:16] don't lose heart amen you know I've
[42:19] heard young people say you know what's
[42:20] the point of continuing to move forward
[42:22] in in my you know and in doing what I
[42:25] want to do in my goals and things like
[42:27] that Amen brother Bram said just
[42:29] continue planting your potatoes continue
[42:32] with your plans but do it with God in
[42:36] your life do it being led by the right
[42:39] thing and by the right influences amen
[42:41] and and and if God if God wants to bless
[42:44] that he will bless it amen if if there's
[42:47] and sometimes we don't know the will of
[42:49] God unless we we we we we we try amen
[42:53] and in trying amen after you've prayed
[42:56] about it then God will lead you in that
[42:59] and you'll know exactly if that's what
[43:00] you need to continue doing or or if you
[43:03] if not amen and so God is God is uh
[43:07] sometimes we just have to trust him amen
[43:09] and have faith amen and just take him by
[43:11] the hand and say Lord you lead me
[43:13] because I can't lead myself you believe
[43:16] the world is falling apart its systems

[43:44] kingdom that cannot be moved it's the
[43:47] Eternal kingdom of God and it cannot be
[43:50] moved amen so thankful that we have a
[43:53] hope a hope there that that that we can
[43:56] we can lean our shoulder upon and it's
[43:59] and my if I I'd certainly be a miserable
[44:02] man if I had to put all
[44:04] my all my trust on Donald Trump or Joe

[45:29] me if I could uh go with them to
[45:32] Honduras to help to be their interpreter
[45:35] and being that I had already you know
[45:37] we've gone several times and this this
[45:39] was their first time going to Honduras
[45:42] they' they've been to other places but
[45:43] not not to Honduras
[45:45] they they asked if I wanted to go and I
[45:48] said sure So we um and and it turned out
[45:53] that that also it was a a perfect timing
[45:55] because another brother which is the
[45:57] brother there in the middle brother Eli
[46:00] he's a pastor there with that was
[46:02] hosting this Youth Camp um it was in the
[46:05] same exact time so it all worked out and
[46:09] um and so here and there's brother
[46:11] Solomon Huffman there on on the right as
[46:13] well uh brother Eli there in the middle
[46:16] had uh had invited brother Solomon to go
[46:19] uh in from Nicaragua when brother
[46:21] Solomon usually goes to Nicaragua to
[46:23] minister at the the the byc camp that's
[46:27] there the Spanish one and uh so this was
[46:31] his first time in Honduras as well so it
[46:33] was first time for all of them uh there
[46:37] so that is at at the camp so this is uh
[46:41] I think this was the day that we got
[46:42] there sweetheart this is the day that we
[46:44] got there and we met up with brother
[46:46] Eric you see brother Eric there on the
[46:47] right you all know brother Eric and um
[46:51] and so we we we got there okay around I
[46:54] guess around noon it was just Christine
[46:56] and me that went this time and
[47:01] um and we this is we stopped by and got
[47:04] a little a little coffee now um poor
[47:07] poor brother Eric I mean every time he
[47:09] he just it's like the devil just
[47:11] constantly fights him so he was carrying
[47:14] uh we were riding in another vehicle
[47:16] with another brother and he was carrying
[47:18] brother Matt and brother uh his his his
[47:21] family and brother Jason in his vehicle
[47:24] and of course you know he had issues
[47:27] with his vehicle so um when he we got to
[47:31] the destination it was something with
[47:32] the brakes but uh there was some other
[47:34] things that had taken place as well
[47:36] while we were heading over there and uh
[47:39] thank God that the money that that you
[47:42] all gave as a love offering we were able
[47:44] to help pay for this repair for them and
[47:47] took care of that for him so
[47:50] um uh he was able to get his vehicle
[47:53] back again now so uh the the youth
[47:57] meetings there brother Elise Church uh
[48:00] in El Sero de Hamas in Honduras there
[48:02] was about 230 youth that attended it was
[48:05] the first Youth Camp that they had at
[48:08] this church now just a little background
[48:11] of this church when I first started
[48:13] coming to this visiting this church at
[48:15] brother Eli brother Elie's the brother
[48:17] that I've worked with to go to Honduras
[48:20] uh up to the those a few years ago when
[48:23] I showed you the videos and the pictures
[48:24] of us going up to the mountains hiking
[48:26] really high well it was him it was him
[48:28] and me that that that we that we went
[48:32] and so um he is right now pastoring this
[48:36] church until they can they get another
[48:39] Pastor so he's there helping them right
[48:42] now I guess he's kind of like the
[48:43] interim pastor because their pastor had
[48:46] passed away so so it was a small group
[48:49] at the time and the church was small as
[48:51] well but they have built on to the
[48:54] church and we have helped with some
[48:56] funds to help them build a Sunday School
[48:59] area in their at the bottom part of the
[49:01] church and some other funds that that
[49:03] came from other churches uh they've
[49:06] helped uh build a pretty much it's a
[49:09] whole it's pretty much a brand new place
[49:11] um you know it's not it's not not as
[49:14] nice as we have it here but it's a it's
[49:16] a lot more room and uh they were able to
[49:19] hold their first youth youth camp and so
[49:23] uh so 230 youth had attended around it's
[49:27] what what they uh what they had that
[49:29] signed up and that showed up there was
[49:31] others that had signed up but they did
[49:33] not show up and overall we had around
[49:36] 300 people that were in attendance there
[49:39] if you add the adults that were there
[49:41] helping out as well so uh this is me
[49:44] right there on the right interpreting
[49:46] for brother uh Jason dears on one of the
[49:49] morning services and and my goodness it
[49:53] was very
[49:54] hot every time we' preach our shirts
[49:57] would just be sticking to our our
[49:59] body but uh we made it through and uh
[50:03] this is kind of the the landscape where
[50:06] we were at up up in in this is the area
[50:09] where where we were at this is this area
[50:11] is called el
[50:15] Hamas um and here's some more pictures
[50:19] there's some of the sisters preparing uh
[50:22] meals and the their their kitchen is on
[50:25] the outside so they're they're they were
[50:29] all all the whole time just really much
[50:31] preparing meals that's uh the Friday
[50:35] night service uh the meetings started
[50:38] Thursday and they went all the way till
[50:40] Sunday so this meeting there on the left
[50:42] is brother Matt Matthew Watkins
[50:45] preaching and I was interpreting there
[50:47] for him and uh we we certainly had a
[50:50] really really good service that evening
[50:53] um people are still talking about it the
[50:56] the Lord really spoke and and really I
[50:59] believe the Lord really met needs there
[51:01] that night and and young people came to
[51:04] the Lord and uh just the Lord used
[51:07] brother Matthew in such a powerful way
[51:09] and I I we appreciated that for him
[51:11] yielding himself that
[51:13] way and uh and then there here's some of
[51:18] the uh the youth uh they're they're
[51:20] singing a special this is I believe uh
[51:23] different youth from few different
[51:25] churches and there there we are there
[51:28] preaching interpreting for brother Matt
[51:31] that same Friday
[51:32] night and uh on one of the services uh
[51:37] during the day they asked for the
[51:38] ministers to come up and uh so the
[51:42] pastors that were there and this is a
[51:44] picture uh of us these are different
[51:47] pastors the pastor right here um if you
[51:52] this brother right
[51:54] here he is uh
[51:57] he drove with his group of of of young
[52:01] people over 14
[52:03] hours and they live out pretty much in
[52:06] the
[52:07] jungles and that's where they have
[52:09] church just to be able to be in
[52:11] attendance to so uh God bless them for
[52:14] it and uh they they were they were there
[52:16] to support the the the the youth
[52:19] meetings and uh his name is brother
[52:22] natividad so
[52:25] um so yeah yeah so
[52:32] that's I didn't um well we leave it like
[52:36] that here's some of a shot of the some
[52:38] of the young people on one of the
[52:39] morning
[52:42] Services as you can see they they always
[52:44] they usually sit them the sisters on the
[52:47] right and the brothers on the
[52:49] left
[52:51] um most churches they do it that
[52:54] way all right on the last service on
[52:57] Sunday I I preached the closing service
[53:00] when before the young people left and uh
[53:03] that's me
[53:08] preaching all right and then there's
[53:10] some more food preparation there on the
[53:12] right now I I wanted to say something
[53:14] about these uh these these beds here or
[53:17] these
[53:18] mattresses they these
[53:23] mattresses go back these little
[53:25] mattresses right there they they they
[53:29] they they keep these mattresses and they
[53:32] use them for all these different youth
[53:33] camps and all these different meetings
[53:35] and and things like that and for a long
[53:38] a long time for many years and they were
[53:40] wearing out and uh uh did we did we help
[53:46] we helped with some of the they needed
[53:48] to have uh to be re re uh I guess
[53:52] upholstered or covered again and so
[53:55] about two or three three years ago I
[53:57] believe it was we with some funds that
[53:59] were used here for your offerings you
[54:03] see some of this stuff you don't know
[54:04] because we use it from your offerings
[54:06] that you give before we leave and and
[54:09] really I failed to kind of tell you it's
[54:12] exactly what but but this is this is one
[54:15] of the things it was over I think it was
[54:18] over 600 of these of these mattresses
[54:22] that were
[54:23] redone and we helped uh the major
[54:26] I guess the majority of that to be done
[54:28] so that they contined to be used for the
[54:30] young people that stay in these youth
[54:33] camps and and and and in ministers
[54:36] meetings and different things like that
[54:37] so here in a moment I'll show you inside
[54:39] the church because usually what they end
[54:41] up doing is they they they end up using
[54:44] the
[54:45] sanctuaries and it's because of the lack
[54:47] of space they really don't have anywhere
[54:49] I mean they don't have nice facilities
[54:51] like at like at bethl and and and byc
[54:54] and stuff like that they got to use what
[54:56] they have and so they got to use the
[54:59] sanctuary the church to be able for
[55:01] example that was the place where the
[55:03] where the young man slept on the floor
[55:05] so they took out all the chairs and
[55:07] every single service they put all the
[55:09] chairs in put all the chairs out and
[55:12] they would use the sanctuary for to
[55:14] house the the boys to sleep there's no
[55:17] other way to do it so you know so you
[55:21] times sometimes you might say well you
[55:22] know you have to be reverent and things
[55:24] like that
[55:25] but what can you do God understands God
[55:30] knows the hearts so so so uh and then of
[55:35] course the sisters they were housed
[55:36] somewhere else you know they have to
[55:38] kind of keep them separate and uh but
[55:41] they lay out all these these these these
[55:43] mattresses and and they sleep all a lot
[55:45] of them just sleep all in one
[55:49] room and so here we are this is a uh
[55:53] having a meal with us the brother here
[55:55] on the right uh um right next to the
[55:58] first sister here on the right that is
[56:00] brother Paco and I know brother Aaron he
[56:03] knows brother Paco and and uh brother
[56:06] Paco is their main interpreter there in
[56:09] Honduras he used to go he used to live
[56:11] here in Alabama and uh he he he uh he
[56:14] was there with brother uh the brother um
[56:18] Homer
[56:19] Lor and uh he had to he had to go back
[56:23] to Honduras and and so God has
[56:26] really used him there and uh and and now
[56:30] he's he's he's he's one of the main
[56:32] missionaries and also the main
[56:33] interpreter there in Honduras so um but
[56:37] he can't do it all on his
[56:39] own so they really it was nice for them
[56:41] to have for him to have the help you
[56:46] know and there's in the evening time
[56:49] some of the areas where we where they
[56:51] sit and have
[56:55] meals all right there's some of the
[56:57] sisters all you know just all around
[57:00] just
[57:03] cooking all right this is the sanctuary
[57:05] and you see how they got the uh the
[57:07] mattresses ready to go that's just some
[57:09] of them and they they they they clean
[57:11] them up they clean up prepare the area
[57:14] and they they just lay down in there and
[57:17] uh they just have to do what what what
[57:20] you know they don't have a nice shower
[57:22] or anything like that I wish I had a
[57:24] picture of the showers that they do have
[57:26] it's like a makeshift thing just around
[57:29] plastic and uh it's really no shower
[57:31] it's just a bucket a big 50-gallon drum
[57:34] and and you just pour water on yourself
[57:37] and that's what they have to do so
[57:41] um I I bet you they they if they went to
[57:44] byc these young people they'd be in
[57:47] heaven or they went to they they just
[57:50] feel like you know wow we got it made
[57:53] and we're complaining why
[58:04] we took a little break you know during
[58:06] one of the services
[58:08] and uh the nearby City had a little mall
[58:11] so we went there and and brother brother
[58:15] um uh Jason dears wanted to pay for a
[58:18] meal uh and we were at actually at a
[58:21] little Pizza Hut so Pizza isn't
[58:24] something they always eat so we took him
[58:27] to a little Pizza Hut and brother Jason
[58:29] dears he he took care of it so we we
[58:32] appreciated
[58:35] that all right this is uh me with
[58:37] brother re renei renei he's a pastor
[58:40] there and and uh if we go to in December
[58:44] you'll meet you'll meet brother retti
[58:45] brother Wade and uh he is down there in
[58:49] in the area near Chola
[58:52] Honduras and um he sends greetings to
[58:55] you all by the way all right so this is
[58:58] the last day and everybody was leaving
[59:01] and uh different pickup truck pickup
[59:03] trucks had their own little the their
[59:05] young people some of them driving
[59:07] different different hours um and so

[59:13] and as we were packing up um there was a
[59:16] storm I don't know if you could if you
[59:18] could see there was a storm getting
[59:19] ready to come and some of those young
[59:21] people I mean they were in that back and
[59:23] they were just the ones that we were

[1:00:44] help and pay for all the food that they
[1:00:46] used with all the with all the the the
[1:00:49] offerings the offerings that you gave um
[1:00:53] so that pretty much was covered there

[1:02:11] D fever the whole time and he was still
[1:02:14] working he was
[1:02:16] still he was still trying to you know
[1:02:19] just we prayed for him we uh and I
[1:02:22] believe about a day or two later he was
[1:02:24] able to feel much better and so um uh he
[1:02:28] was the first two uh Services he didn't
[1:02:31] attend but then the last two he was able
[1:02:33] to do to attend so God answered prayer
[1:02:36] there so we were able to give him a
[1:02:38] little offering for helping us stay in
[1:02:40] in in his home and um and
