[43:36] given us
[43:38] thank you for the word that we have Lord
[43:41] and we want more we want more of you
[43:43] Lord
[43:44] Lord I pray that you should open us up
[43:46] Lord open our eyes open our ears that we
[43:49] may see and hear you Lord be with the
[43:51] ones that are sick that are not with us
[43:53] Lord I pray this should touch them Lord
[43:55] in their body
[43:57] Lord I pray this should be with this
[43:58] church as a body too Lord all people
[44:00] that have anything to do with the church
[44:03] father we pray this should just give
[44:05] them strength Lord I know it's a
[44:08] sometimes it's a struggle to drive and
[44:11] do all the things and stay here all day
[44:12] and and spend money on food we we
[44:15] realize that Lord and we we pray that
[44:18] you will bless the people that have made
[44:20] the effort to come Lord and sit and
[44:22] listen Lord to maybe just a moment of
[44:25] what you got to say to them Father
[44:27] forgive us of our sins bless us in the
[44:30] further middle of their service we with
[44:32] us Lord as the Morales come visit Lord
[44:34] this week be with them on the highways
[44:37] be with us Lord as we
[44:39] go and take some fellowship
[44:42] to brother Andre heads Lord we pray this
[44:44] should be with him Brother Richard
[44:45] Wilson also Lord there together
[44:48] we pray that you'd bless us Lord in our
[44:50] fellowship just be with us now and take
[44:51] care of us in Jesus name
[44:53] amen
[44:56] I touched something while I was praying
[44:57] all right in the beginning was the word
[44:59] the word was with God and the Word was
[45:01] God what that word you we're going to
[45:04] take it later on but
[45:06] when we talk about Agape you got to talk
[45:09] about the word of God
[45:10] agape love is the word of God that's
[45:13] what he actually that you know God could
[45:15] express itself any other way and he did
[45:17] he went to the Stars he went to the
[45:19] pyramid
[45:21] but he wanted to get it to us in Word
[45:24] now when he got this agape love the love
[45:26] of God into word it became flesh
[45:30] because it had to be equal with us
[45:33] according to Romans 8 it had to become
[45:35] equal with us so that we can even
[45:37] understand this word
[45:39] there's a lot of things in the Bible I
[45:41] don't know about you there's a lot of
[45:42] things in the Bible I don't understand
[45:44] hello there's a lot of things I don't
[45:47] understand in the Bible all right it's
[45:49] going to be made known but there's a lot
[45:51] of things I do understand in the Bible
[45:53] and I understand God said if he give it
[45:56] to us and required it through a prophet
[45:58] brother round and said if God required
[45:59] it he's got to already put it in there
[46:02] for you to make it all right so if
[46:05] there's going to be brother Ramsay the
[46:06] rap stream Faith lays in what books and
[46:08] tapes these books and tapes which is the
[46:10] enhanced word of God for us it's the
[46:13] love letter that God wrote to us the in
[46:15] between the lines is what we're getting
[46:17] now is that love letter from God and it
[46:20] doesn't have anything to do with the
[46:21] Trinity doesn't have anything to do with
[46:23] false Doctrine it's Truth All right so
[46:27] in the beginning was the word and the
[46:29] Word was with God and the Word was God
[46:31] and that word was made flesh and dwelt
[46:33] among us we behold his glory the glory
[46:35] the only begotten of the father
[46:37] full
[46:38] of Grace that's what I want I want us to
[46:40] get full we're going to talk about that
[46:42] in a minute about sister Shepard's dream
[46:43] that that pyramid got so full it started
[46:46] running out
[46:47] that's what I wanted to do I want to
[46:49] start running out
[46:50] I I don't I don't want to ooze I won't
[46:52] run
[46:53] I want to just just if Billy George
[46:56] needs something I want to just flow
[46:58] right down to him
[46:59] when you're sitting here today
[47:02] when you're out on your job where you're
[47:04] anywhere you're at doesn't matter if
[47:06] those people flip you off call you
[47:08] whatever
[47:09] you just keep you just keep packing it
[47:12] in you just keep letting it out listen
[47:13] you're going to probably be the only
[47:15] breath of fresh air those people ever
[47:17] see
[47:19] do you think about that next time you
[47:21] choose your words
[47:23] choose your words lightly
[47:25] and you know don't choose your words
[47:27] lightly in other words don't do that
[47:29] because you may be able to what
[47:32] let the water out let it run on them and
[47:35] let them feel something that they had
[47:37] never felt before
[47:38] that's what I want
[47:40] I want I mean they felt enough of my
[47:42] junk
[47:43] and my and my stuff
[47:46] I want him to feel God
[47:48] and his presence as they've always
[47:52] told us this
[47:54] himself when we was down here in 06 but
[47:58] he was relating to the picture because I
[47:59] think his daughter had just painted the
[48:01] picture this one it's right there in the
[48:03] room where he he painted a picture she
[48:05] did Brother Ram he took a picture of
[48:06] brother brown with the over the fire you
[48:09] know they were they were hunting and
[48:10] it's right in there but his daughter did
[48:13] that but brother biscoll relayed the
[48:15] message that brother Branham was going
[48:16] to like stay up a little while
[48:18] so he kind of took the first watch and
[48:20] kept the fire going and then and then
[48:23] um no brother Ed did and brother brother
[48:26] random got over under a bush
[48:29] and laid there went to sleep for a
[48:31] couple hours and then brother Brown you
[48:33] know he woke him up and said brother
[48:34] Brown now you know I'll let me take a
[48:36] nap he said he laid down right where
[48:38] brother Brown was that said said he had
[48:40] never had felt that feeling of a
[48:42] presence
[48:43] of God
[48:45] he didn't want to get up
[48:47] he said I never felt that before
[48:49] and you can see like some like sister
[48:51] clean in different ones I know brother
[48:52] George Canada always told us that that
[48:54] when brother random would look or he
[48:56] would say something to one person they
[48:58] would be sitting standing right beside
[49:00] of them they'd feel that presence sure
[49:03] he said oh that's just for a prophet no
[49:05] I want that to be us
[49:07] I want us to have the presence of God so
[49:10] much to till we don't
[49:12] not love everybody
[49:14] right that's what I want to do okay
[49:16] that's that's our goal let nothing be
[49:18] done through Strife or vain Glory but in
[49:20] loneliness of Mind Let each esteem
[49:22] others better than themselves you may be
[49:25] seated and if we get to this we'll get
[49:27] to this today because I want to get to
[49:29] because we're going to have to explain
[49:30] and I didn't bring it today but we're
[49:33] going to have to explain that for those
[49:34] of you that are here that that have
[49:37] weren't here at the beginning
[49:39] this part of your journey or this part
[49:43] of your
[49:44] um Christianity starts at Faith and
[49:47] faith is a new birth
[49:49] all right that's when God takes the old
[49:52] nature you had Burns it out by the fire
[49:55] of God not by the fire of anybody else
[49:57] by the fire of God burns your old nature
[50:00] out
[50:01] and puts his nature in
[50:04] that means that you are birthed from
[50:06] above not birthed from Hall County
[50:09] hospital or Northeast Georgia Medical
[50:11] Center they're by with me all right or
[50:14] some of y'all owed you birthed at home
[50:15] but anyway
[50:17] wait praise the Lord that's right
[50:20] just thought I'd throw that in there
[50:22] but that's down here now we see this
[50:25] word Holy Spirit up here
[50:28] all right there are many people in the
[50:30] message now brother Branham and I'll
[50:32] bring the quote later on but I don't
[50:33] want to throw it to you right now I want
[50:36] to read you what Corinthians says but
[50:37] but brother Brown says you've got all
[50:39] this way and you don't have the holy
[50:41] spirit yet now
[50:43] then there's a teaching in the message
[50:45] that teaches that you got to have all
[50:46] these virtues before that's your new
[50:49] birth well that can't happen because
[50:51] this is God God God if you don't have
[50:55] the new birth you're devil devil devil
[50:57] devil devil
[50:59] with me if you're not born again today
[51:02] you have a soul that is demon-possessed
[51:08] yes you do
[51:11] either face or doubt
[51:13] God and the devil one of the two all
[51:16] right so if he burns the old you out
[51:18] burns the old you out puts to puts the
[51:21] Genesis 1 26 man the love of God the
[51:24] agape love what we were reading in
[51:25] Genesis 1 26 when he puts that in there
[51:28] then you begin to believe
[51:34] like God believes
[51:35] then you begin to have virtue like God
[51:38] had virtue knowledge knowledge of God
[51:40] tempers patience godliness broadly
[51:42] kindness but that Holy Spirit is written
[51:44] there for a purpose and it's very
[51:47] important
[51:48] all right that it's placed there brother
[51:50] random place that there listen that's
[51:52] not
[51:53] you can't read that in second Peter
[51:58] all right because let me read it real
[51:59] quick second Peter 1 verse 5. look and
[52:02] besides this and he talks about the
[52:03] divine nature of God all right come on
[52:07] take your hand like this
[52:10] all right you got it put it right here
[52:13] pinch
[52:19] thank you
[52:20] but anyway we're all family here okay
[52:26] we are where's the Perrys at
[52:29] that it takes both of them to take care
[52:31] of that baby
[52:34] bless her heart
[52:36] oh Gene you got the baby you got the
[52:38] where are they at
[52:41] I guess they sold they sang a song they
[52:43] have to go in there and get water and
[52:44] eat something and come on back up here I
[52:46] guess
[52:47] but I appreciate the pairs they have a
[52:49] good testimony we really appreciate them
[52:51] coming and uh
[52:53] and being a part of our part of our
[52:55] assembly for a little while we borrowed
[52:57] them from Brother Jewel so
[52:59] oh there she is now they come in after
[53:03] we after we talked about them
[53:05] so anyway
[53:09] what was I talking about I'm just
[53:11] kidding but no it says besides this in
[53:13] other words you've got to get the divine
[53:15] nature of God for him to impart it out
[53:18] because you can't he's not going to
[53:20] impart this nature of God is not going
[53:23] to be imparted to mirror you if he knows
[53:25] we're not gonna go on or use it or if
[53:29] we're going to use it wrong everybody
[53:31] with me so he gives you the new birth
[53:34] and then Peter says besides this in
[53:36] other words besides the new birth
[53:37] besides you starting on your Christian
[53:39] Journey giving all diligence add
[53:42] Okay add
[53:45] to your faith virtue and all his
[53:46] Temperance patience godley's brother
[53:47] kindness now it continues on says if to
[53:51] brotherly kindness charity so the Bible
[53:53] takes it on up to to hear
[53:57] but the prophet of God knew what he was
[53:59] talking about knowing that the Holy
[54:01] Ghost Holy Spirit Holy Ghost same thing
[54:04] had to be there to finish the product
[54:08] because watch
[54:10] let me just cover this if it's okay
[54:13] this
[54:18] the musicians they'll kill me if I do
[54:20] anything
[54:22] remember this is this is what we've been
[54:25] dealing with since Christ left
[54:29] everybody with me this is what we've
[54:31] been dealing with the headstone of the
[54:34] church has not been here
[54:38] amen
[54:39] we've had the Cornerstone right Chief
[54:42] Cornerstone
[54:44] to build the building
[54:46] and even Paul talking about being a
[54:48] master builder
[54:50] Paul was teaching us Paul and Peter and
[54:53] James and all the different ones
[54:54] teaching us how to live this but this
[54:59] was withheld
[55:02] you know why
[55:03] the Bible says The Headstone was
[55:06] rejected
[55:07] all right so we're going by the Bible
[55:09] not Bible hearsay or what even what
[55:11] brother Brown said the Bible says that
[55:13] the headstone was rejected it was a
[55:16] stumbling Stone a rock of offense amen
[55:19] amen so it wasn't here it was now look
[55:23] still there right
[55:24] but it was hid
[55:26] the book was closed
[55:29] now it's open but the book was closed
[55:31] the seals how to get your body changed
[55:37] was withheld
[55:39] because Peter and James and John they
[55:41] had all this working in their life
[55:44] all right and I say irenius in different
[55:46] ones too if you if you may
[55:49] but this
[55:51] was not there
[55:53] get by with me all right
[55:56] so that's why this is important we'll
[55:57] get to in just a minute but now since
[56:00] the seals broke
[56:02] what came
[56:05] in in a form we could watch in Arizona
[56:08] in 1963 we could see the headstone
[56:13] coming down
[56:15] amen coming down on the church not on
[56:19] just William Brown on all of us I say
[56:21] church I say bride listen
[56:24] denominational World they don't care
[56:27] anything about clouds
[56:29] you've seen 90 well not 90 half the
[56:31] people in the message are are debating
[56:33] it was even Larry
[56:36] come on
[56:37] this is a sign to me that God is here
[56:42] that he came in 1963 through the word
[56:47] not but it came to a prophet had to come
[56:50] to a prophet because that's what the
[56:52] Bible said but it was The Headstone
[56:54] brother Brown said to the church
[56:58] where the church or the bride they're by
[57:00] with me
[57:01] so that's got to fit though this yes
[57:06] the reason it came
[57:08] was somebody came to that
[57:12] but you say well why did Paul not get
[57:14] the headstone Paul wasn't promised to
[57:17] the first church agent was not promised
[57:19] a headstone
[57:20] only in the end time when the son of man
[57:23] that's what I'm telling you this this is
[57:26] not
[57:27] I wasn't going this way but I am now
[57:30] this is the this is the church age
[57:34] bride
[57:36] can everybody see this don't look at my
[57:37] ball head
[57:39] I know you did Aaron did because he's
[57:41] like mine
[57:44] 's about six four you wouldn't see it
[57:47] amen
[57:48] but anyway this is this is a revelation
[57:51] that God give in the Bible
[57:54] that was open
[57:57] to Paul irenius Martin Club this was
[58:00] their message
[58:01] all right everybody with me this is
[58:03] their met this is the Son of God
[58:05] revelation
[58:08] God in
[58:11] a bride
[58:12] all right right
[58:14] Son of God
[58:17] which is the new birth
[58:19] all right
[58:21] then when you get to our age
[58:24] it requires that the son of man
[58:27] according to Luke 17 30 and who was the
[58:31] son of man son of man is God that word I
[58:34] was talking about in human flesh
[58:37] now listen we know it was in human flesh
[58:40] here but it was in human flesh
[58:42] and a part
[58:45] because Wesley didn't have an open book
[58:47] Wesley still preached trinitarian
[58:49] Doctrine God went into ignorance of that
[58:51] and but let Wesley bring his message of
[58:55] sanctification all right amen
[58:57] am I making sense all right so then you
[59:01] come up here to
[59:03] uh to um Malachi 4 5 he's going to turn
[59:08] the hearts of the children back to the
[59:12] Pentecostal fathers
[59:14] 1906 no 80 30. we're not going back to
[59:19] 1906 is Right Here Right 80 30s right
[59:23] here
[59:24] hey bye with me all right he's going to
[59:26] turn us back that message is going to
[59:28] turn us back to where he takes not zeros
[59:31] this guy out but takes their message
[59:34] plus
[59:36] takes their message opens the book and
[59:38] says no we got to get back to here to
[59:41] where Paul these three Church age
[59:44] Messengers right here never preached
[59:47] trinitarian Doctrine
[59:50] remember they only started baptizing in
[59:52] like 300 A.D which was in Mark past
[59:55] Martin heading into Columbia by the
[59:57] Catholic church so those doctrines were
[59:59] not here that's why we had to be turned
[1:00:02] back to the faith of the fathers
[1:00:06] now remember brother Brown said though
[1:00:08] this messenger Malachi forced to do two
[1:00:10] things
[1:00:10] one take the people
[1:00:13] forget about all these lines this is
[1:00:15] where we are people wise time wise all
[1:00:19] right
[1:00:20] and he's going to turn us back by
[1:00:23] revelation
[1:00:25] to hear
[1:00:27] Amen brother Brown said did I preach for
[1:00:30] paw print he said I preached what Paul
[1:00:32] did Paul make it he said yeah Paul made
[1:00:34] it remember he went over across the
[1:00:35] certain time he said if Paul make it he
[1:00:38] said yeah Paul made it he said well I
[1:00:39] preach the same thing Paul prays he
[1:00:41] didn't say I preached the same thing
[1:00:42] Wesley free
[1:00:43] he said I preached the same thing Paul
[1:00:45] preached and in preaching the same thing
[1:00:48] that Paul preached he literally that
[1:00:50] message brought us back to here
[1:00:53] his message but that's the first part
[1:00:56] if it brought us back to right here
[1:00:58] we're just going to die again
[1:01:04] because we're right here I mean you can
[1:01:05] you can come back and start this race
[1:01:07] again you can just keep looping like
[1:01:09] this something's going to happen to
[1:01:11] bring this back
[1:01:12] so number two brother Brown said two
[1:01:16] to open in other words in my
[1:01:18] paraphrasing to open the Bible to the
[1:01:20] Thunders and the seals
[1:01:23] to literally turn us back in other words
[1:01:25] why it literally turn us back not to
[1:01:27] here to Christ
[1:01:29] when he was standing on the Earth
[1:01:32] because that's the son of man message
[1:01:34] Luke 17 30 and the days when the son of
[1:01:37] man is what being revealed
[1:01:39] today you're under that anointing
[1:01:42] of the son of man being revealed all
[1:01:44] right amen but we've got to go through
[1:01:47] this journey
[1:01:48] of virtue knowledge temples places
[1:01:50] goddess brother kindness that's why
[1:01:51] brother Ram said it was required
[1:01:54] it was a requirement that we make it but
[1:01:57] there's other there's anointings I want
[1:02:00] you to read this right here let's go to
[1:02:01] First Corinthians 2 verse 12. maybe this
[1:02:04] will help now this is I'm heading I'm
[1:02:06] jumping way up there where it says holy
[1:02:07] spirit it's up there for a reason okay
[1:02:10] now we have received not the spirit of
[1:02:13] the world but the spirit which is of god
[1:02:15] that we might know the things that are
[1:02:18] freely given to us of God
[1:02:20] which is not false Doctrine right which
[1:02:23] things also we speak now here's Paul
[1:02:26] saying I'm speaking this
[1:02:28] all right not in The Words which man's
[1:02:31] Wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost
[1:02:34] teacheth comparing spiritual things with
[1:02:37] spiritual
[1:02:38] all right now we take and we say they're
[1:02:41] natural types of spiritual but we've got
[1:02:42] to understand we've got to come to a
[1:02:44] place where the natural goes away
[1:02:46] natural is temporary natural is filial
[1:02:50] natural will make you sin
[1:02:55] but the spirit of God will never make
[1:02:57] you sin
[1:02:58] now the spirit of man the spirit of the
[1:03:01] devil absolutely but the spirit of God
[1:03:03] the Holy Ghost
[1:03:05] will teach us remember the Bible says
[1:03:08] and will show us things to come
[1:03:10] comparing spiritual things with
[1:03:11] spiritual and that's what brother Brown
[1:03:13] did
[1:03:14] he took us and he literally opened he
[1:03:18] didn't physically open a book he opened
[1:03:20] our eyes he opened our revelation
[1:03:24] two back to the face of the fathers then
[1:03:27] he said he would bring his message which
[1:03:29] would be the opening of the seals which
[1:03:31] in 1963 all that that happened as a sign
[1:03:35] to me that brother Branham not that he
[1:03:37] was this great something but he was
[1:03:40] but you know what it brought me it I
[1:03:43] knew
[1:03:44] at my point of my journey that was a
[1:03:47] sign to me that God
[1:03:48] was back here
[1:03:51] in his entirety
[1:03:53] in one human at the time one
[1:03:57] first fruits gotta have one person here
[1:03:59] gotta get a start somewhere
[1:04:02] Jesus wasn't it nobody but Jesus at the
[1:04:04] time Jesus was here everybody with me
[1:04:07] can I say that again Jesus was not in no
[1:04:09] other person
[1:04:11] when he was here but in himself but now
[1:04:14] in the dead Pentecost only that
[1:04:17] Pentecost it was 120 of them
[1:04:19] little Jesus is running around and
[1:04:21] that's what he wanted amen but when they
[1:04:23] started they started down here with the
[1:04:25] pure word
[1:04:26] kept preaching the word of God preaching
[1:04:28] the word of God till you get up to where
[1:04:30] the Catholic Church takes over and
[1:04:32] starts interjecting and brother Ryan
[1:04:33] said takes the Holy Ghost out and puts
[1:04:36] their own ideas in now that's what
[1:04:37] happened but God winked at the ignorance
[1:04:40] of those people and let him preach that
[1:04:44] because God can't preach false Doctrine
[1:04:47] and Wesley was a man of God
[1:04:50] Luther was a man of God right
[1:04:54] but their Doctrine wasn't all right
[1:04:58] that's why I read y'all several weeks
[1:05:00] ago that a church without a Doctrine is
[1:05:02] like a jellyfish it has no backbone you
[1:05:06] gotta have a Doctrine our Doctrine is I
[1:05:09] say our Doctrine is maturity you see
[1:05:10] some Churches they preach the same thing
[1:05:12] they preached 30 years ago 40 years ago
[1:05:15] and guess what you are what you hear
[1:05:21] you are what you hear if your pastor
[1:05:24] can't get you past a new birth you ain't
[1:05:26] going past him
[1:05:28] praise God ours did
[1:05:31] amen
[1:05:34] there was a maturity taught and listen
[1:05:36] it's like brother
[1:05:38] um ulti we've known him I mean he came
[1:05:41] here to church in 70 early 70s when he
[1:05:43] first came in the message I mean he
[1:05:46] didn't attend the church here but he
[1:05:47] would always come here for meetings and
[1:05:48] stuff and him and brother Dale were were
[1:05:50] close then
[1:05:53] because we fellowship with brother Dole
[1:05:55] which was in Augusta and that kind of
[1:05:57] put us all together but um
[1:06:00] he said
[1:06:01] he said you know he said people
[1:06:03] um think you and your dad's a little
[1:06:05] arrogant
[1:06:09] he said he said he said he said I
[1:06:12] defended you he said no he said they
[1:06:13] just know what they're talking about
[1:06:20] I'm just telling you that's what another
[1:06:22] preacher said
[1:06:23] he said no they're not arrogant they
[1:06:25] know what they believe what they preach
[1:06:27] and they can back it up
[1:06:29] and to me like brother like brother Dale
[1:06:31] always said you know brother
[1:06:33] um
[1:06:33] um Perry green you know bragged about
[1:06:36] being in a hundred and something
[1:06:37] countries well if the dude went to a
[1:06:39] hundred and some countries he ain't
[1:06:40] bragging he went
[1:06:43] right now if I go to bragging I've been
[1:06:45] in a hundred and something countries you
[1:06:46] can call me a liar
[1:06:49] because I've only been in a few Alabama
[1:06:51] was one of them
[1:06:56] but but that's what you see because the
[1:06:59] Paul Paul you know you know it's okay
[1:07:02] for Paul to say the boldness of
[1:07:04] preaching it's okay for Paul to say
[1:07:06] you'll be judged by my gospel it's okay
[1:07:08] to say for Paul you know well Paul said
[1:07:10] for us to be and for the you know Peter
[1:07:13] said for us to stand up and be bold you
[1:07:15] know stand up and be bold but when
[1:07:17] brother Dale gets up and Bowl they're
[1:07:19] like he's just arrogant
[1:07:22] well so was Paul
[1:07:25] I wasn't arrogant he knew what he was
[1:07:26] talking about
[1:07:29] listen
[1:07:32] principle
[1:07:33] he'll be judged by the gospel that's in
[1:07:35] this church
[1:07:38] and you more is required more is given
[1:07:42] more is required
[1:07:44] you can't sit here and say we dream milk
[1:07:50] so
[1:07:52] if you don't get it
[1:07:54] it's your fault and mine
[1:07:57] I'm part of it too
[1:07:59] but let's get back to this so he brought
[1:08:01] us back to the foundation and now we are
[1:08:05] by The Prophet's message we're moving up
[1:08:08] into this statue of a perfect man but
[1:08:11] there's something got to happen right
[1:08:12] there that seals the deal
[1:08:16] all right well talk to you about in just
[1:08:18] a minute
[1:08:19] so it says this though giving all
[1:08:21] diligence add to your faith first
[1:08:22] Universal knowledge and all this
[1:08:23] Temperance add add then we were talking
[1:08:26] about this morning about the Genesis 1
[1:08:27] 26 man the agape love
[1:08:30] the agape love is what come to you at
[1:08:32] the new birth that's what brought you
[1:08:35] the faith of Jesus Christ and not this
[1:08:37] is not the faith of William Branham this
[1:08:40] is not the faith of Samuel Dell or Wade
[1:08:42] Dale
[1:08:43] that's the faith of God
[1:08:46] but once it's given to you I love what
[1:08:48] brother Brown said he said this is my
[1:08:50] eye he said God gave me this eye and now
[1:08:54] it's mine so in other words God gave me
[1:08:57] the Holy Ghost in 1998. now it's mine
[1:09:01] but you know what there's a requirement
[1:09:03] that comes with that God give it to you
[1:09:06] what are you going to do about it
[1:09:08] amen it's in your hands now
[1:09:11] much is given
[1:09:13] much is required
[1:09:16] let us make man our own image so he did
[1:09:18] so now he's working on that image to
[1:09:21] build that stature back
[1:09:23] not statue we're not statues
[1:09:26] statues don't move
[1:09:28] stature is what growth development is
[1:09:30] when you when you got the little marks
[1:09:32] you know Deanna
[1:09:34] of course she's a tall girl but we've
[1:09:36] got her in the in the uh on the whatever
[1:09:39] we call that thing right there on the
[1:09:41] side of the door in the bathroom every
[1:09:44] time you know about every six months
[1:09:45] we'll soccer up against that thing and
[1:09:47] we'll mark it you know and put the date
[1:09:49] on it
[1:09:50] she's growing in stature right
[1:09:53] and you can see the growth Spurs they
[1:09:55] just want several you know the the last
[1:09:57] year she's only grown about that much
[1:09:59] but buddy the year before that it was
[1:10:01] like four inches so you can track all
[1:10:03] that same thing with God
[1:10:06] same thing with the gospel
[1:10:09] if you don't love the Lord more than we
[1:10:10] started number one to 119. if you hadn't
[1:10:14] learned something okay you can blame me
[1:10:15] but I blame you too
[1:10:17] because you listen to it
[1:10:19] and I hope it was right
[1:10:22] but what are we gonna do about it more
[1:10:24] is given more is required we have been
[1:10:26] given with hormones
[1:10:30] we should be bigger and taller
[1:10:34] than others
[1:10:36] so God created man his own image so now
[1:10:39] we have come into that image and then on
[1:10:41] Masterpiece I love her brother Brian
[1:10:42] said he said the the the flaw so all the
[1:10:46] flaws of Moses uh no uh all the
[1:10:49] different ones all their flaws we look
[1:10:51] at them and we learn from them
[1:10:54] right
[1:10:55] we learn from those there are examples
[1:10:58] we were talking about this morning
[1:11:00] but God saw us as a masterpiece family
[1:11:03] and that's what he's building back
[1:11:04] listen God didn't tear it down
[1:11:08] Satan tore it down but God Drew Paul
[1:11:12] calling himself a master builder
[1:11:14] He is building this family back up
[1:11:19] and we do have flaws
[1:11:22] we're human
[1:11:25] but as brother Brown says the flaw The
[1:11:27] Mooring
[1:11:29] is what makes it a masterpiece
[1:11:34] how in the world would you have a
[1:11:35] testimony if you didn't have trials and
[1:11:37] tasks
[1:11:39] you could not stand up here and give a
[1:11:41] testimony if your life was perfect
[1:11:46] I testified Dave my life's perfect you
[1:11:48] ain't never heard nobody stand up until
[1:11:50] that
[1:11:51] usually if I was this and I was that and
[1:11:53] I was lost and I was this and
[1:11:59] right
[1:12:00] okay then that we were marred
[1:12:05] moreover Brethren I would not you should
[1:12:06] be ignorant how that all our fathers
[1:12:08] were under the cloud dude we're talking
[1:12:09] about this this morning all passed
[1:12:11] through the sea baptized under Moses in
[1:12:13] the cloud and in the sea and did all
[1:12:16] these same spiritual meat in other words
[1:12:17] went to the same message Church read the
[1:12:20] same message books listen to the same
[1:12:22] message tapes all right and did all eat
[1:12:25] of the same spiritual me is that not
[1:12:26] what we're doing today we're eating on
[1:12:27] spiritual meat all right and did all
[1:12:29] drink the same spiritual drink for the
[1:12:31] drink of that spiritual rock that
[1:12:33] followed them and that rock was Christ
[1:12:35] but with many of them God was not well
[1:12:38] pleased for they were overthrown in the
[1:12:40] wilderness now these things were our
[1:12:43] examples
[1:12:45] like I said before you took the old you
[1:12:47] take the Old Testament out and you've
[1:12:49] took about half your sermons out
[1:12:52] amen
[1:12:54] lots of testimonies you take out
[1:12:56] especially Abraham
[1:12:58] people preach on Abraham it don't matter
[1:13:00] if it's a Methodist Baptist Pentecost or
[1:13:02] whoever they preach on Father Abraham
[1:13:04] he's the father of the of our faith now
[1:13:07] these things were our examples to the
[1:13:09] intent we should not lust after in other
[1:13:12] words the things they lusted after
[1:13:14] Fame Fortune Lord why are you not doing
[1:13:17] this why are we eating all this uh
[1:13:21] wafers we want something different
[1:13:24] so we give them quail and kill them
[1:13:26] because it was not in the plan
[1:13:29] was for them to eat manna because that's
[1:13:32] what he's saying I'm going to give you a
[1:13:34] man I'm going to give you a double
[1:13:35] portion on Saturday you or Friday you
[1:13:37] can't do anything with it on Saturday
[1:13:39] and well I'll start again on Sunday
[1:13:41] remember somebody tried together so even
[1:13:43] sticks on the Sabbath day and God killed
[1:13:45] him
[1:13:46] neither be idolaters that's where some
[1:13:48] of them has written the people sat down
[1:13:50] to eat and drink and Rose up to play is
[1:13:52] that what we're doing
[1:13:54] need to let us commit fornication that
[1:13:56] some of them committed and fell on one
[1:13:57] day 23
[1:13:59] 000 people
[1:14:00] need to let us tempt Christ if some of
[1:14:02] them also tempted and were destroyed of
[1:14:04] serpents that's when the serpents
[1:14:08] um
[1:14:08] poisoned them neither murmur and some of
[1:14:10] them murmured and were destroyed
[1:14:12] of the Destroyer now these things will
[1:14:14] happen to them for examples and they are
[1:14:17] written for our admonition to whom the
[1:14:19] ends of the world
[1:14:20] are come
[1:14:22] and remember that word means pattern or
[1:14:24] the mark of a stroke or blow a figure
[1:14:26] formed by a blow or an impression hence
[1:14:29] a figure an image
[1:14:31] a form the teaching which embodies the
[1:14:34] sum and substance of religion and
[1:14:35] represents it to the Mind manner of
[1:14:37] writing the content and form of letter
[1:14:39] in other words sermons all right a
[1:14:42] pattern of warning
[1:14:44] of ruinous events because remember David
[1:14:47] stood one day and said God
[1:14:50] you've lived in Tavern you've lived in
[1:14:52] Badger skins
[1:14:55] all the whole time
[1:14:57] I won't build you a house
[1:15:01] remember and then Nathan said do all
[1:15:03] this in your heart David
[1:15:05] but God went back to Nathan and said
[1:15:07] hold on a minute
[1:15:09] we got a problem
[1:15:11] David you shed too much blood
[1:15:13] he killed Uriah
[1:15:15] he commanded adultery you've done too
[1:15:17] much David you can't do it but I promise
[1:15:19] you your son will amen so he gave him a
[1:15:22] son that built Solomon's Temple right
[1:15:27] but to ruinous events which serve as
[1:15:29] admonition or warning to others in a
[1:15:31] doctrinal sense it's a type
[1:15:34] a personal thing prefiguring a future
[1:15:36] person or a thing Jesus was all in the
[1:15:39] Old Testament they just couldn't see him
[1:15:40] when he came here in flesh all right
[1:15:43] brotherly kindness so now
[1:15:46] we come to brotherly kindness what a
[1:15:48] brotherly kindness was it was
[1:15:49] Philadelphia which meant just it's just
[1:15:51] love it's just love for the brethren all
[1:15:53] right but our problem is is our love as
[1:15:56] I've always said our love and feel your
[1:15:58] love is conditional
[1:16:00] think about that our filial love is
[1:16:04] conditional
[1:16:12] so-and-so's my favorite preacher
[1:16:14] oh what about the other guy I don't like
[1:16:16] him
[1:16:20] that must be on condition
[1:16:22] because that preacher probably stepped
[1:16:23] on your stinking toes
[1:16:25] one day and that's why you don't like
[1:16:27] him
[1:16:28] or he said something you didn't like
[1:16:33] I've heard it
[1:16:38] God don't let you decide who he loves
[1:16:44] I've said it many times before there's a
[1:16:46] lot of you I'm glad you're not God
[1:16:51] I said you
[1:16:54] I'm glad we're not God
[1:16:56] because we're critical
[1:16:58] we have so much feel your love to where
[1:17:01] don't you tell me
[1:17:04] now don't tell me
[1:17:06] that feel your love is not conditional
[1:17:09] you say I love my wife unconditionally
[1:17:12] there's days
[1:17:15] preach brother yeah I believe it will
[1:17:22] I don't know I love her
[1:17:25] around her
[1:17:27] oh wait a minute y'all all lying if
[1:17:29] you're not
[1:17:30] Lily stop that business y'all ain't been
[1:17:32] married long enough
[1:17:37] remember that's why June tells me to go
[1:17:39] hunting
[1:17:44] do not
[1:17:46] tell him to stay home
[1:17:52] but we got to get Outfield if we thank
[1:17:54] God that God's love is not feeling your
[1:17:57] love
[1:17:58] because see then it would be just like
[1:18:00] this
[1:18:01] right
[1:18:03] remember though he can't unlove you if
[1:18:06] he loved you to begin with thank God for
[1:18:09] that he cannot I love you if he loved
[1:18:13] you to begin with you're loved all the
[1:18:15] way through
[1:18:18] like brother Brown said thank God he
[1:18:20] can't see my sins
[1:18:22] he hears my voice through the blood
[1:18:25] all right now remember
[1:18:28] put yourself in the person's place I've
[1:18:30] said always said before
[1:18:32] something happened the other day
[1:18:35] and um it was kind of a similar
[1:18:37] situation and you just don't know what
[1:18:38] people are going through you don't know
[1:18:40] what people kind of day they're having
[1:18:41] so you just don't want to make their day
[1:18:44] worse
[1:18:46] because like I said you're probably the
[1:18:47] only God or closest to God that they'll
[1:18:50] ever see they'll see the God of this
[1:18:51] evil age and somebody will cuss them out
[1:18:53] or give them the middle finger wave or
[1:18:55] or run them off the road and they'll
[1:18:57] shoot you now if you cut people off you
[1:18:59] know right they don't care anything
[1:19:01] about life
[1:19:04] but you're still somebody that's a
[1:19:06] little bit
[1:19:08] upset
[1:19:09] just say God bless you we were somewhere
[1:19:11] the other day and we says Lord bless you
[1:19:14] and I mean it's just like they go
[1:19:17] that's right now you do see some that
[1:19:19] told one lady told us yesterday said God
[1:19:21] bless you and I thought I did the same
[1:19:23] thing
[1:19:26] but but we do why should I mean we
[1:19:29] shouldn't be that way like I always said
[1:19:31] before
[1:19:32] uh and you know that's this is me if I
[1:19:35] go through Walmart and I see something
[1:19:36] laying in the floor I pick it up and put
[1:19:38] it on the Shelf
[1:19:40] if I go through the parking lot at the
[1:19:42] post office I went through the parking
[1:19:43] lot the other day and I'm going to tell
[1:19:45] the truth there was something Landing
[1:19:46] there in the in out in the parking lot I
[1:19:49] didn't pick it up
[1:19:51] if I can't identify it I ain't gonna
[1:19:53] pick it up but most of the time if it's
[1:19:55] a plate or a napkin or a a cup or
[1:19:59] something I'll pick it up and throw in
[1:20:00] the trash and then something that was in
[1:20:02] the floor the other day in the post
[1:20:03] office and two people just stepped over
[1:20:06] it well I picked it up and the
[1:20:07] Postmaster said I was wondering if
[1:20:09] somebody's gonna pick that up
[1:20:11] I said yeah I try to make things a
[1:20:13] little bit better
[1:20:14] right my attitude may not be better but
[1:20:17] I try to leave the world a little bit
[1:20:19] better place
[1:20:21] and that's life lesson what was it June
[1:20:23] 763
[1:20:25] all right
[1:20:27] but you know what it makes me feel
[1:20:28] better
[1:20:33] does it not make you feel better to make
[1:20:35] things better
[1:20:36] well you know what you say well that's
[1:20:38] human that is human but if it's God
[1:20:41] telling you this is the things we need
[1:20:43] to do on the Earth
[1:20:45] to keep it better and make it better we
[1:20:47] know this the god of the evil age we
[1:20:48] know that but you've got your own little
[1:20:50] world
[1:20:50] need keep it clean
[1:20:53] my brother sinned against me shall I
[1:20:55] forgive him seven times a day
[1:20:57] that's pretty good but Jesus said no 70
[1:21:00] times 7.
[1:21:02] brotherly kindness now you see if her
[1:21:04] brother's All Out Of Tune don't be
[1:21:05] impatient with him see be kind to him go
[1:21:08] anyway then there was he's talking about
[1:21:10] how in the world did Brother Brown do
[1:21:12] you put up with these people he said
[1:21:15] hoping someday see patience with him see
[1:21:17] temperate enduring with him knowledge to
[1:21:19] understand what he believes
[1:21:21] you ever tried to do that
[1:21:24] brother Ram always says put yourself in
[1:21:26] their place yes because putting yourself
[1:21:28] in the place you understand maybe you
[1:21:30] understand why they're going through it
[1:21:32] or you try to understand what they
[1:21:33] believe
[1:21:34] and listen if it's contrary to you
[1:21:36] that's okay
[1:21:38] that's okay if they try to explain the
[1:21:40] Trinity to you I don't want you to sit
[1:21:42] there with a knife
[1:21:46] I don't believe that
[1:21:51] listen to what they got to say I'm
[1:21:53] blessing I'm I'm preaching on myself
[1:21:54] today
[1:21:57] me quick on the trigger
[1:22:04] but watch this
[1:22:07] John 13 34 this is what we're talking
[1:22:09] about this morning a new commandment and
[1:22:10] I put that in big a new one
[1:22:13] why did he bring a new commandment
[1:22:16] he really brought a new commandment out
[1:22:19] of an old commandment
[1:22:21] he can't change the word of God
[1:22:24] he did not stand there and say all right
[1:22:27] you don't have to live the Old Testament
[1:22:28] I'm here now you don't have to live that
[1:22:32] no he healed that leper
[1:22:35] remember he healed the people with the
[1:22:37] blind eyes what's the first thing he
[1:22:39] said he said go do the law of Moses
[1:22:41] because remember if you were cleansed as
[1:22:43] a leper you had to go to the priest and
[1:22:45] they had to examine you
[1:22:47] and if he found no scars or boils or
[1:22:51] whatever open source then you were not a
[1:22:53] leper anymore and they didn't have to
[1:22:55] stick you over in the corner somewhere
[1:22:56] right
[1:22:58] Jesus didn't say well bless God I'm God
[1:23:00] I'm no he said go do the law because he
[1:23:03] was born what under the law
[1:23:04] all right so he's giving him a new
[1:23:07] commandment that you love one another
[1:23:08] because they had always come to the
[1:23:10] place he knew one thing for sure those
[1:23:13] Pharisees didn't love nobody but
[1:23:15] theirselves
[1:23:16] they love their self you could tell that
[1:23:19] because they were always tempting God
[1:23:21] they were always tempted in the Lord
[1:23:24] by this shall you know that you are my
[1:23:27] disciples if you have love
[1:23:29] one to another in other words an outward
[1:23:32] display
[1:23:34] an outward display
[1:23:37] but let your communication be yeah yeah
[1:23:39] and Nate Nay for whatsoever is more than
[1:23:41] these cometh of evil you have heard that
[1:23:44] it's been said Thou shalt love thy
[1:23:45] neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say
[1:23:47] unto you love your enemies bless them
[1:23:49] that curse you
[1:23:51] that's hard to do
[1:23:58] love your enemies bless them that curse
[1:24:01] you do good to them that hate you
[1:24:08] it didn't say evil for evil
[1:24:12] well we always call it in the South get
[1:24:14] back at them
[1:24:17] the golden rule in the south is due unto
[1:24:19] others and run
[1:24:21] [Laughter]
[1:24:24] no no do unto others as you would have
[1:24:27] them do unto you okay
[1:24:30] dude well I brought back a memory do

[1:28:16] don't don't despitefully use them and
[1:28:18] they're not despitefully using you
[1:28:20] because I'll promise you one thing for
[1:28:21] sure this is life lesson 763
[1:28:25] kids you're gonna grow up and God for
[1:28:28] forbid we make it long enough you're
[1:28:30] gonna have kids
[1:28:32] right right
[1:28:34] and you'll find out exactly that the
[1:28:37] love that we had for you sure it may not
[1:28:41] have come the way you wanted it
[1:28:43] but does the love of God come exactly
[1:28:45] the way we want it
[1:28:49] no it doesn't
[1:28:51] because we go
[1:28:52] oh Pete love me he'd give me this no
[1:28:55] that means the way God works
[1:28:59] no that's why he always said and it was
[1:29:02] a it was a young man we were talking
[1:29:03] yesterday on my mail route and he said
[1:29:06] you know what he said God's ways are
[1:29:07] funny I said yeah the Bible says they
[1:29:09] are
[1:29:10] he says my ways are not your ways
[1:29:13] my thoughts are higher than your
[1:29:15] thoughts in other words you're just
[1:29:17] zeroed out
[1:29:20] but thank God when you have the mind of
[1:29:22] Christ you can understand a little bit
[1:29:24] of what God's telling us amen that's why
[1:29:26] the new birth is the most important then
[1:29:28] you become and go up to be an adult in
[1:29:32] Christ listen you can be an adult in
[1:29:34] Christ and be 20
[1:29:36] years old
[1:29:38] rb70
[1:29:40] and B2
[1:29:43] if anybody's 70 I just hit that number
[1:29:45] okay
[1:29:48] you talk about me yeah probably if you
[1:29:50] were 70. and still acting two absolutely
[1:29:54] but we want our don't we want our kids
[1:29:56] to grow up
[1:29:57] but it's hard it's a hard battle
[1:30:01] this is yes
[1:30:02] it's a hard battle
[1:30:04] to get them to see so so the battle then
[1:30:07] don't let us you know I pray for Michael
[1:30:09] I pray for all the young kids
[1:30:12] but y'all pray for me
[1:30:14] pray for your parents like I said this
[1:30:16] morning you pray for them they'll make
[1:30:21] them because you listen until you get to
[1:30:23] the age of accountability they're your
[1:30:25] Holy Ghost so their decision is what you
[1:30:27] got to bear
[1:30:29] am I okay brother Daniel do you did you
[1:30:32] grow up the same way
[1:30:34] his grandpa was a message preacher he's
[1:30:37] just from the whole line

[1:30:43] picked her up out somewhere out of the
[1:30:44] world
[1:30:45] and amen I know we know
[1:30:48] same way with you
[1:30:49] but we all come a different way all

[1:30:54] predestination you think about the
[1:30:56] things that you the choices you make in
[1:30:58] life

[1:31:02] right
[1:31:04] brother Hal Thomas's daughter Debbie
[1:31:06] Janet was here she'd know she was a
[1:31:08] little nine-year-old girl so we've known
[1:31:09] each other for a period of time
[1:31:12] and uh
[1:31:14] so I had you know I hadn't she would
[1:31:16] come to church I'd go to church at
[1:31:17] brother Mike's and she'd come here the
[1:31:19] only way we could see each other is go
[1:31:20] to church I kind of like that idea

[1:32:52] looking for another one but now to make
[1:32:54] a long story short though and and I say
[1:32:57] this I say this with all respect
[1:33:00] Debbie's not a message believer
[1:33:03] she she just when she got married she
[1:33:05] just went out you know she didn't go out
[1:33:06] in the world become wild but she got
[1:33:08] married had kids and don't care a thing
[1:33:10] about the message
[1:33:12] don't even go to a message Church don't
[1:33:13] even believe it short hair pants all
[1:33:16] that stuff
[1:33:18] see the difference
[1:33:26] I know my mother prayed for me to help
[1:33:27] get a good girl but she just wasn't she
[1:33:30] just she just wasn't expecting her
[1:33:32] that's right

[1:33:42] it was a mistake
[1:33:51] I'm playing an instrument from now on
[1:34:01] even out of what they thought was a
[1:34:02] mistake

[1:34:26] but we made it
[1:34:27] [Music]
[1:34:29] we had our conversation in times past
[1:34:31] you don't don't get me wrong it wasn't
[1:34:33] uh uh what do you call it Camelot
[1:34:37] but now we love God a lot
[1:34:39] and that's what makes a difference amen
[1:34:42] and my parents prayed for me but you
[1:34:44] know my problem was though I didn't pray
[1:34:46] for them brother George
[1:34:49] am I getting somewhere over there kids
[1:34:52] I'm telling you pray and listen even us
[1:34:54] like me I need to pray for my mom and
[1:34:56] dad now
[1:34:58] uh connection apparent that's my living
[1:35:01] parents that's your blood down here
[1:35:04] right as long as you got them alive you
[1:35:06] need to pray for them
[1:35:08] Michael you need to pray for your mama
[1:35:09] your mama's done an outstanding I mean I
[1:35:14] I almost cry
[1:35:17] when I realized what sister milk was
[1:35:19] went through
[1:35:20] to raise you two young men
[1:35:22] and boy did she do a good job
[1:35:32] but you know what even all under all out
[1:35:34] of all that adversity she kept her
[1:35:36] Christianity
[1:35:38] because it was true
[1:35:40] it was the foundation she come to this
[1:35:42] church not just this church she came and
[1:35:45] listened
[1:35:46] she heard she matured and being that she
[1:35:49] matured she could raise two mature
[1:35:51] listen
[1:35:53] a parent that's a kid Can't Raise a kid
[1:35:56] to be a parent
[1:35:58] they're about with me
[1:36:00] I mean if you're 40 well
[1:36:03] I ain't going there never mind
[1:36:06] I'll get on video games in a minute
[1:36:09] if you're 40 years old you got kids and
[1:36:11] you're sitting around playing video
[1:36:12] games you're lost
[1:36:15] I don't mean maybe not lost in the Lord
[1:36:17] but you're lost
[1:36:19] get alive
[1:36:21] love your wife
[1:36:24] play games with her
[1:36:25] what an idea
[1:36:28] but I'm Sandy love your enemies
[1:36:30] bless them that curse you do good to
[1:36:33] them that hate you and pray for them
[1:36:36] which despitefully use you and persecute
[1:36:39] you
[1:36:41] that you may be the children of your
[1:36:43] father now we all want to be children of
[1:36:45] God right that's how to do it
[1:36:48] that's your formula right there
[1:36:51] for he maketh his son to rise on the
[1:36:54] evil and on the good and sendeth Reign
[1:36:56] on the just and the unjust for if you
[1:36:59] love them which love you what reward
[1:37:01] have you
[1:37:04] you do not even do not even the
[1:37:06] publicans the same and if you salute
[1:37:08] your brethren only
[1:37:13] that's why brother Brown said look he
[1:37:14] said don't be clannish don't be cliquish
[1:37:17] I know we all have our little groups
[1:37:20] but that's okay birds of a feather and I
[1:37:23] don't mean that bad I mean you know if
[1:37:25] you're sitting over there talking about
[1:37:28] um Electronics
[1:37:31] I might go somewhere else and find
[1:37:32] somebody talking about hunting
[1:37:34] you know but that's okay but if you're
[1:37:36] talking about the word of God you should
[1:37:38] never walk away from it
[1:37:40] because the word of God is what is
[1:37:42] common and what brings us all together
[1:37:45] amen it does and that's supposed to be
[1:37:47] that you feel comfortable
[1:37:49] comfortable around these guys talking
[1:37:51] about uh computers and bits and bytes
[1:37:53] and
[1:37:54] right bro George is like
[1:37:58] that ain't hitting anywhere
[1:38:00] but you start talking about a little bit
[1:38:02] of hunting I'll get a little closer to
[1:38:03] you but you start talking about the Lord
[1:38:05] I'm right there with you
[1:38:07] right that's what we have in common we
[1:38:09] may not like each other as far as you
[1:38:12] know that uh things of the of the nature
[1:38:15] of going out and hunting and different
[1:38:16] things but when we come to the word of
[1:38:17] God it should be everybody's Focus turns
[1:38:19] in
[1:38:20] makes us common all right sisters too
[1:38:24] if you salute your brethren only in
[1:38:26] other words
[1:38:27] Michael's my favorite I'm just gonna
[1:38:28] hang around him
[1:38:30] you'd hate that wouldn't you I was going
[1:38:32] I was gonna hang around him
[1:38:34] bro dirty
[1:38:39] [Music]
[1:38:40] that's in my bud
[1:38:43] because you've done something for me see
[1:38:45] what I mean
[1:38:46] conditional
[1:38:50] I'm supposed to love Michael even if he
[1:38:52] don't if I know he don't like me
[1:38:55] if you don't like me so
[1:39:05] dad told me one thing a long time ago
[1:39:07] and I went this is life lesson 760
[1:39:09] nine nine not five five seven sixty five
[1:39:14] if everybody loves you you're a
[1:39:15] hypocrite
[1:39:18] and you think about that
[1:39:20] if everybody loves you you're a
[1:39:22] hypocrite
[1:39:23] I mean I these people grates my cheese
[1:39:26] just the way it is
[1:39:28] man I grate theirs
[1:39:30] like dick said my spirit irritates your
[1:39:33] demons
[1:39:35] yeah yours
[1:39:37] vice versa
[1:39:39] as a father have to love me we're just
[1:39:41] family as a father hath loved me so have
[1:39:44] I loved you continue
[1:39:46] love listen agape love remember feel
[1:39:49] your love brother Rama I read the quote
[1:39:51] a couple Sundays ago all other loves
[1:39:53] have a beginning and an end
[1:39:56] filio love has a beginning and an end
[1:39:58] you'll never love your wife on the other
[1:40:01] side like you lover now
[1:40:06] it will turn into total agape love which
[1:40:10] is Genesis 1 26 never had a beginning
[1:40:12] it'll never have an end all right
[1:40:14] perfect love that's what brother Brown
[1:40:16] calls him
[1:40:18] so continue ye and my love now you can
[1:40:21] only continue if the Love's eternal all
[1:40:24] right so we put our faith in Jesus that
[1:40:26] he loves us
[1:40:28] if you keep my Commandments look if you
[1:40:31] keep my Commandments you shall abide in
[1:40:33] my love
[1:40:34] now that's not just 10.
[1:40:36] even as I have kept my father's
[1:40:38] Commandments and abide in his love
[1:40:41] these things have I spoken unto you that
[1:40:43] my joy might remain in you and that your
[1:40:45] joy might be full
[1:40:48] listen I appreciate when people
[1:40:50] uh you know like brother Brown said that
[1:40:52] guy said oh I don't like people bragging
[1:40:54] on me brother Brown said he's a liar
[1:40:56] I don't mind somebody packing me on the
[1:40:58] back and saying a good job some of you
[1:41:00] ain't never done it but that's okay
[1:41:02] I can look over that this is my
[1:41:04] commandment that you love
[1:41:10] you love love
[1:41:11] them both I loved you
[1:41:15] um
[1:41:15] now I wrote myself a note brothers or
[1:41:17] sisters that denotes you're from the
[1:41:19] same family
[1:41:20] I mean you won't now it is okay to go to
[1:41:23] the convenience store and the guy's
[1:41:25] selling liquor and beer and all that
[1:41:27] other stuff and you say God bless you
[1:41:28] brother but that ain't saying God bless
[1:41:31] you brother like we're saying to us
[1:41:34] right
[1:41:35] we would like listen and that's why I
[1:41:37] was thinking about the other day I
[1:41:38] thought if I brought it this way they're
[1:41:39] gonna they're gonna say something about
[1:41:40] it but I'm hoping they're wanting to be
[1:41:43] my brother
[1:41:44] I'm hoping that my life will convert
[1:41:47] them
[1:41:48] that they will be my brother and come in
[1:41:50] come in family of God
[1:41:52] we're already in
[1:41:54] you're already in the family of God
[1:41:56] you're not struggling trying to get in
[1:41:59] you're in
[1:42:00] so you want others to come in
[1:42:08] a comfortable be around family
[1:42:11] I mean most of the time
[1:42:13] you do have them weird cousins
[1:42:15] but anyway
[1:42:19] but when I go home today I'll go in my
[1:42:22] Mom and Daddy's house and I feel just as
[1:42:24] comfortable
[1:42:26] I'll take my shoes off but we don't
[1:42:28] drink on the tap tap floor but we can
[1:42:30] take our shoes off
[1:42:31] and put our feet up
[1:42:33] and enjoy what's in the fridge
[1:42:36] if Mama tells us to
[1:42:39] no I mean so it's same thing here that's
[1:42:42] why I tell ministers I said look don't
[1:42:44] be nervous
[1:42:45] this is a family meeting
[1:42:48] this is brothers and sisters getting
[1:42:50] together in a family reunion and we want
[1:42:53] to hear what you got to say about our
[1:42:55] daddy
[1:42:58] because now we all got the same Daddy
[1:43:01] I want you to tell me what your Daddy
[1:43:04] has done for you and I'm telling you
[1:43:06] today what my daddy's done for me and I
[1:43:09] hope it helps you
[1:43:11] because we got the same Daddy
[1:43:13] I hope we do
[1:43:15] Divine love and Sovereign Grace let me
[1:43:18] get this real quick
[1:43:19] 1956. now we're facing a day now this is
[1:43:22] 1956.
[1:43:24] think about today
[1:43:27] I was thinking the other day of going
[1:43:29] down the road
[1:43:30] and most of the time in the South all of
[1:43:33] us are from the south pretty much you
[1:43:35] you know somebody comes by you know car
[1:43:38] comes by you
[1:43:40] or at least if you're driving you go you
[1:43:43] know hey how you doing you know right
[1:43:46] now you get the other one
[1:43:48] but nobody hardly now I mean it's just
[1:43:51] like well there goes Terrance and he
[1:43:53] never said he never even looked at me
[1:43:55] but
[1:43:56] you two menus always you know and you
[1:43:58] didn't even know if you knew him or not
[1:44:00] so brother Brown says now we're facing a
[1:44:02] day with prophesied that Brotherly Love
[1:44:05] would become a strange thing among
[1:44:07] people
[1:44:09] and it's to my humble belief that that
[1:44:11] is the greatest of all the gifts in the
[1:44:15] Bible
[1:44:16] wow
[1:44:17] I read you this quote the entirety of it
[1:44:19] so I broke it down a little bit to save
[1:44:21] time brotherly love will become strange
[1:44:24] and it's my humble belief remember he he
[1:44:26] said if God took me on the platform and
[1:44:29] says I'm going to give you the greatest
[1:44:30] Ministry the greatest healing campaigns
[1:44:33] I'm gonna give you the greatest gift but
[1:44:35] I'm gonna withhold love from you which
[1:44:37] one would you want
[1:44:38] brother I'm emphatically said Give Me
[1:44:40] Love
[1:44:42] take every gift you've got God but one
[1:44:46] Give Me Love
[1:44:48] so what's the greatest gift we should be
[1:44:50] looking for love
[1:44:51] love I'm talking about agape love
[1:44:54] and the only way you can get agape love
[1:44:56] is to be born again and then get into
[1:44:58] the word of God
[1:45:00] all right let's look at this for a
[1:45:01] minute because this is a selfish world
[1:45:03] to be selfish is to be concerned
[1:45:05] excessively or exclusively with one
[1:45:08] selfie
[1:45:09] selfishness is one of the biggest
[1:45:11] obstacles to having the kind of close
[1:45:12] relationship with God why
[1:45:16] why because you're looking to self all
[1:45:18] the time
[1:45:21] I want to be able to look in the mirror
[1:45:23] brother George and see Christ
[1:45:25] not see this guy
[1:45:28] the kind of close relationship with God
[1:45:30] and the inspiring relationship with
[1:45:32] other people
[1:45:34] that many of us desire you can't be
[1:45:37] selfish
[1:45:39] and be friends to people
[1:45:42] I am crucified with Christ here's where
[1:45:44] Paul just laid it right out he said
[1:45:46] nevertheless I live in other words I've
[1:45:48] got a life
[1:45:49] yet not I but Christ live within me now
[1:45:52] I've got the new birth and the life
[1:45:54] which I now live like I said before and
[1:45:57] brother
[1:45:58] um Mike was bringing it out Sunday there
[1:46:00] was a life before this
[1:46:02] even though listen even though people
[1:46:05] can be loving and sweet and nice there's
[1:46:08] some just people have that nature
[1:46:11] and they'll be in hell
[1:46:13] because they never accepted Christ and
[1:46:15] that love
[1:46:17] they're just loving people maybe had
[1:46:19] loving parents maybe had loving
[1:46:20] grandparents so it just came down
[1:46:21] through the kids I've seen people that
[1:46:23] way even like Brother Richard Wilson
[1:46:25] said he was preaching on Statue of
[1:46:26] perfect man years and years ago he said
[1:46:28] there's a man in my
[1:46:30] in my plant that's just so Meek and
[1:46:32] mouse if you said look John I'm going to
[1:46:35] take your paycheck away from you this
[1:46:36] week and I ain't gonna give you nothing
[1:46:37] I'm gonna get you a paycheck he said
[1:46:39] that man will say well if you need it
[1:46:41] take it
[1:46:43] not me
[1:46:45] bless God I worked 40 hours for that
[1:46:47] paycheck
[1:46:48] right
[1:46:50] well your name man I'll amen for you
[1:46:52] every one of you do it
[1:46:55] how many of us ever give your paycheck
[1:46:56] to your
[1:46:57] that's what I thought
[1:47:01] and I said paycheck and I didn't say a
[1:47:04] certain person anybody
[1:47:06] except your wife
[1:47:08] boy can I go home with one y'all
[1:47:13] she's actually got the car keys and
[1:47:15] she's leaving me here I need somebody to
[1:47:17] take me home
[1:47:19] Hannah's stuck in Six Flags without a
[1:47:22] key so she's got to go down there and
[1:47:24] they're gonna make her kids so pray for
[1:47:25] that situation she's gotta drive all the
[1:47:28] way to Six Flags so anyway she got to
[1:47:30] leave here in just a few minutes but you
[1:47:32] know what life happens
[1:47:34] do it for your kids right
[1:47:40] I'm
[1:47:42] Paul says I'm crucified but now the life
[1:47:44] I now live now look he didn't say he
[1:47:47] didn't live in the flesh he said the
[1:47:48] life which I now live in the flesh
[1:47:51] I live by the faith of the Son of God
[1:47:54] not my faith his faith
[1:47:56] all right who loved me and gave himself
[1:47:59] for me so he has took that life of
[1:48:00] himself out
[1:48:02] that's why you take people like brother
[1:48:04] they're on different ones that that have
[1:48:06] just look at his body now
[1:48:08] and I'm sorry if you think I'm bragging
[1:48:10] he's my dad and he's one of the greatest
[1:48:11] man I've ever met in the face of this
[1:48:13] Earth okay all right
[1:48:16] I wish I'd be like him more but I don't
[1:48:18] want to be him
[1:48:19] okay you understand I want to be my own
[1:48:21] individual and you need to be your own
[1:48:23] too all right but you take look how they
[1:48:25] wore their self out why because of you
[1:48:29] I say Dad let's go hunting this it's rut

[1:49:24] the knife the life I now live I live by
[1:49:27] the faith of the Son of God so my life's
[1:49:29] been taken out
[1:49:31] and his life has been put in

[1:50:02] while play catch with us

[1:50:20] that say is the life I now live
[1:50:23] see
[1:50:25] and become so unselfish
[1:50:30] unselfish a servant is never selfish

[1:50:50] you that's what a whole lot the matter
[1:50:52] with the people today they're not
[1:50:53] friendly 1950.
[1:50:56] all right yeah

[1:51:05] I tell you they're not friendly like
[1:51:07] they used to be the people's got too
[1:51:10] selfish got to a place where they think
[1:51:11] they live in a little world all by
[1:51:14] themselves you know that's the truth now
[1:51:18] I put this in red because this is a
[1:51:20] prophet tell them I'm fixing to tell you
[1:51:22] three quotes this one another one and
[1:51:25] another one
[1:51:27] where brother Branham
[1:51:29] he says
[1:51:30] I despise
[1:51:34] that old somebody
[1:51:36] feels they're bigger than somebody else
[1:51:40] hmm
[1:51:43] he was a human
[1:51:45] 1954 listen to this I recognized the
[1:51:47] other day a selfish Spirit Come On Me
[1:51:49] I'm saying this man's wrong I ought to
[1:51:52] tell him about it he said that's wrong
[1:51:55] God's the one to tell him about it it's
[1:51:58] none of my business but my business is
[1:51:59] to preach the gospel and love everybody
[1:52:01] and move on and love my enemies as Jesus
[1:52:04] Christ listen we spend a lot of time
[1:52:06] what's that old saying I was trying to
[1:52:07] get it the other day maybe we need to
[1:52:08] Google that one too where it says that
[1:52:11] people spend 90 percent of the time
[1:52:13] worrying about people worrying about
[1:52:15] them only 10 of the time
[1:52:18] in other words I'm like what's Michael
[1:52:19] thinking about me oh Lord he's probably
[1:52:21] sitting there no he ain't he's working
[1:52:25] he don't he might he God bless my
[1:52:27] brother and that's about it you know
[1:52:30] you know I don't do the same thing if if
[1:52:31] there's something comes up like sister
[1:52:33] and I had talked about something and and
[1:52:36] and
[1:52:37] she get a little harsh
[1:52:43] everybody say Amen
[1:52:45] she and I clash with each other and we
[1:52:48] have but that's okay it's all right
[1:52:51] but
[1:52:53] but two minutes later brother George
[1:52:55] honestly with my hands up to the Lord
[1:52:57] It's Gone
[1:53:00] why do you want to keep
[1:53:02] how many times have you done that though
[1:53:03] you've held on held on
[1:53:05] and held on Gina held on
[1:53:09] hold on I bet you I bet you oh um
[1:53:14] sister Anna is sitting over at her house
[1:53:16] just steaming mad and talking about men
[1:53:19] and you know you go through the whole
[1:53:22] thing you know and and then like Aunt
[1:53:24] sits around the camera to me one time
[1:53:25] she said I want to apologize for
[1:53:27] something something and I'm like
[1:53:28] wouldn't you say that
[1:53:31] right
[1:53:32] and I know one thing's for sure once we
[1:53:34] get something straightened out and
[1:53:35] straighten out we're done
[1:53:37] there's no grudges there's no oh well
[1:53:39] I'm gonna I got enough to worry about
[1:53:41] sitting worried about what y'all think
[1:53:43] about me
[1:53:45] collectively
[1:53:48] but we do the old saying we spend way
[1:53:52] too much time worrying about what
[1:53:53] somebody else is thinking about us when
[1:53:55] that person ain't worried about you they
[1:53:57] got their own issues life lesson 6 95 6.
[1:54:02] 76. you got to keep up with it
[1:54:07] ought to tell him about it that's wrong
[1:54:08] God's wanted to tell him about it it's
[1:54:10] none of my business but my business is
[1:54:12] to preach the gospel and love everybody
[1:54:14] and move on
[1:54:16] move on
[1:54:19] me in general have a spat think about
[1:54:22] that
[1:54:23] just had one a few minutes ago and uh
[1:54:27] but I'm over it now we'll talk about it
[1:54:29] later if she's overwritten but I I'm
[1:54:32] over it now
[1:54:35] yeah
[1:54:37] but how many of you have
[1:54:42] I ain't going no further
[1:54:45] blessing Lord worry about stuff that you
[1:54:48] should never even worry about
[1:54:53] and you should never listen you need to
[1:54:55] be an altar if you are fabricating a
[1:54:58] plan
[1:55:00] to get back at somebody
[1:55:03] and we've done it wait a minute I'm not
[1:55:04] going to call any hands I'm gonna raise
[1:55:06] it for all of you
[1:55:08] we've all fabricated a plan you remember
[1:55:10] what brother Dale and different ones
[1:55:12] that says boy you know I'm me and my
[1:55:14] wife we say something and I bless God I
[1:55:17] go to work and I'm like when I get home
[1:55:18] I'm on absolutely let her have it she
[1:55:21] fitting to get it because I'm the head
[1:55:23] of the house and she's gonna get it
[1:55:25] she's going to just absolutely get it
[1:55:28] as soon as you open my door she's
[1:55:30] standing there and your favorite outfit
[1:55:35] I said yours not hers
[1:55:38] and she says honey I am so sorry I love
[1:55:40] you
[1:55:42] and I got your favorite meal
[1:55:44] cooked on the stove
[1:55:47] it just blows your whole day it really
[1:55:49] makes you mad
[1:55:50] more mad than what you were because
[1:55:51] you're worried about all day what she's
[1:55:53] going to do now is that not us right and
[1:55:56] this is all got to do with brotherly
[1:55:57] kindness because we do that to other
[1:55:58] people if you try to fabricate a way to
[1:56:01] get back at somebody you need a new
[1:56:04] birth
[1:56:05] thank God God doesn't fabricate away
[1:56:08] listen he made a way for us to get back
[1:56:11] to him not to drive us away from me who
[1:56:16] drives us away from God we do
[1:56:18] we do
[1:56:21] my stake himself
[1:56:26] I want to ask the church one more thing
[1:56:27] before we get some place to study in the
[1:56:29] scriptures
[1:56:30] that you'll pray for me
[1:56:33] oh wow a prophet
[1:56:36] I've developed a critical spirit
[1:56:40] oh now brother Branham come on
[1:56:43] I want y'all to realize something did
[1:56:45] you see that
[1:56:47] he talks about having a selfish spirit
[1:56:49] in the word become flesh 1954 1003 it
[1:56:55] would be all right if that was just one
[1:56:57] sermon
[1:56:59] I mean one thing in a couple of you know
[1:57:01] so the next thing he says he's going to
[1:57:03] have a critical spirit watch where he
[1:57:04] preached this at
[1:57:08] same message
[1:57:12] he's continuing down the line
[1:57:15] getting himself cleaned out
[1:57:17] I want to ask the church one more thing
[1:57:19] before we get someplace to study that
[1:57:20] you'll pray for me I've developed a
[1:57:22] critical spirit and it haunts at me
[1:57:25] I told my wife yesterday the first time
[1:57:28] something happened now we're sitting in
[1:57:30] the yard and I told her she had reminded
[1:57:32] me and I told her about it I said honey
[1:57:33] I've got to a place till I've become
[1:57:36] critical of people
[1:57:38] I don't want to be whose job is it it's
[1:57:41] not mine and God's the one to criticize
[1:57:44] not me
[1:57:46] Jubilee a year 1954 this was priests in
[1:57:50] the evening of 1003
[1:57:53] same day
[1:57:55] different message
[1:57:56] I'm not going to ask you how many made
[1:57:58] the concentration but I believe many of
[1:58:00] you did and myself I did in My Heart
[1:58:02] Lord take that critical spirit from me
[1:58:06] he said it the morning
[1:58:09] and now he's saying in the afternoon
[1:58:10] same thing
[1:58:13] now I don't criticize people out to
[1:58:15] their face that's what I was telling you
[1:58:16] after the service this morning
[1:58:19] I don't criticize people out to their
[1:58:21] face but in my heart I do
[1:58:23] I see a lady walking down the street
[1:58:25] especially that see she's not dressed
[1:58:27] properly I say isn't that awful in my
[1:58:30] heart I don't say it to nobody else
[1:58:32] after all that's her business
[1:58:36] she's a free moral agent she ain't got
[1:58:37] no right to do it
[1:58:39] Christ bought her life but maybe she
[1:58:42] doesn't understand
[1:58:44] wow
[1:58:46] so it's not for me to criticize let God
[1:58:49] do that when I'm in the Pulpit I'll
[1:58:51] preach the gospel the best way I know
[1:58:53] how and the rest of it I'll commit to
[1:58:56] God
[1:59:00] let's stop right there I can't get to
[1:59:02] the rest of it
[1:59:04] musicians come on
[1:59:08] because we'll get to uh we'll get to the
[1:59:10] holy ghost in a minute
[1:59:12] in a little bit but I wanted to read
[1:59:13] that but I won't read it I'll wait it's
[1:59:15] almost four o'clock
[1:59:19] and I forgot to announce that we needed
[1:59:21] to have communion today so I think we'll
[1:59:22] let's have it next Sunday
[1:59:25] I forgot
[1:59:27] I didn't
[1:59:29] huh
[1:59:36] are you leaving me too
[1:59:42] okay we'll do it
[1:59:44] maybe the next weekend I forgot about
[1:59:46] today though somebody remind me of that
[1:59:48] because we didn't have it last weekend
[1:59:49] because we had special service let's
[1:59:51] stand our feet but we don't like to miss
[1:59:53] communion
[1:59:54] I think it's important
[1:59:56] that we have communion so we will have
[1:59:58] it
[1:59:59] on the 20
[2:00:02] no I'll tell you
[2:00:06] that'd be too close then we'd have it
[2:00:08] y'all don't mind having two weekends in
[2:00:10] a row
[2:00:13] all right so let's have it on the uh
[2:00:17] the weekend we get back from up yonder
[2:00:20] we'll be there the 14th 15th 16th so 16
[2:00:23] and 7 is 23rd we'll have it on the 23rd
[2:00:26] okay they'll be okay with that we'll
[2:00:28] have it on the 23rd and then we'll be
[2:00:30] back on the first of the month I I do
[2:00:32] apologize for that we should have had it
[2:00:34] today but that was my fault for not
[2:00:36] mentioning that
[2:00:37] for it thank you I will thank you that's
[2:00:39] one out of 80.
[2:00:43] visitors don't even forgive you anymore
[2:00:48] God bless you let's say no he's not a
[2:00:50] minister you're right
[2:00:54] sometimes y'all listen too well it's
[2:00:55] just like a kid you know you don't want
[2:00:57] the kid to hear a thing
[2:00:59] and that's what they hear and you want
[2:01:01] you tell us like Johnny Johnny Johnny

[2:07:00] chase him around and find him he runs
[2:07:02] away from his little scooter you know
[2:07:03] you have to find him and go hand it back
[2:07:05] to him because he's up and about so you
[2:07:08] know why because he's always been that
[2:07:09] he's always been that way his whole life
[2:07:11] never has been a man to sit around and
[2:07:13] not do anything he's always been doing
[2:07:14] something for the church or or the house
[2:07:16] or us keeping up with us was a full-time
[2:07:19] job
[2:07:20] and building all of our houses and all
[2:07:22] that stuff so but we sure appreciate him
[2:07:24] and and he stood for God all these years
[2:07:26] I'm just praying God stand for him
[2:07:28] God stand for
[2:07:30] okay we can stand for him but let's pray
[2:07:32] that God stands for him and condemns
[2:07:35] that demon because we know it's all the
[2:07:36] devil it's just the devil
[2:07:38] Hey listen he'll take me and you out if
[2:07:40] he could
[2:07:42] God ever releases his hand off of you
[2:07:46] he did with job didn't he
[2:07:49] and the problem was the devil wasn't
[2:07:51] even looking for job
[2:07:53] was all fat and happy and sitting there
[2:07:55] under the umbrella of the Lord and the
[2:07:58] Lord said hey
[2:08:00] devil
[2:08:01] come here a minute
[2:08:03] have you considered my servant job
[2:08:05] he said Lord you gotta you got an
[2:08:08] anointing around him
[2:08:09] you got a dome around him and you just
[2:08:12] he just prospers because he does
[2:08:13] everything that you you ask him to do so
[2:08:15] if you'll take that Dome off or or take
[2:08:18] that anointing off of him he said I'll
[2:08:20] make him curse you to your face God's
[2:08:22] like
[2:08:24] devil I don't know
[2:08:26] I don't know if I'll do that or not he
[2:08:27] said nah go ahead
[2:08:29] just don't take his life
[2:08:31] hey no you go do whatever you need to do
[2:08:33] don't take his life in other words God's
[2:08:35] inside of himself going
[2:08:38] I know what's going to happen
[2:08:41] devil I didn't
[2:08:42] I didn't choose John Henry over here I
[2:08:44] told you to choose job because I knew
[2:08:46] what job would do
[2:08:48] amen and you know what Joe got a little
[2:08:50] critical brother Ryan said he had a
[2:08:52] little critical spirit on him little
[2:08:54] self-righteousness
[2:08:56] but he stood up one day and he said I
[2:08:58] know my redeemer liveth he saw a
[2:09:00] revelation
[2:09:01] he saw brother George he saw the end he
[2:09:03] didn't matter about what went on he saw
[2:09:05] the end of his life and he said
[2:09:08] I'm gonna see that guy and he was very
[2:09:11] specific he said I'm going to see him in
[2:09:13] my flesh
[2:09:14] I'm gonna see him in my flesh
