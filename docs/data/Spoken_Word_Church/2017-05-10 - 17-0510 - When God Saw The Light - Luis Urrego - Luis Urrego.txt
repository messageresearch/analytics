don't want to keep you all here all night but ain't no telling when we're gonna get get to preach again so so so we're just gonna hit as hard as we can a men praise the Lord love the Lord amen praise God um let's turn to number let's turn to Genesis chapter 1 Genesis chapter 1 praise the Lord then after that we'll read Genesis John chapter 1 the reason why I say we don't know when it would get the priest because now we have all these brothers there again ready to start coming through and and so just no telling but but we'll just do the best we can amen praise the Lord I want to title this tonight I want to call this when God saw the light when God saw the light amen and this light that we're just going to discuss about talked about this light that's like here isn't what you think it is and yet it is what you think it is praise the Lord let's read it in Genesis 1 in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that's where I got my little title from and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light the darkness they immediately God takes and divides that light from darkness praise God and God called the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first days now let's look at John chapter 1 very familiar scripture to all of us but a very powerful scripture amen John chapter 1 verse 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shyness in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not praise the Lord Jesus let's just go to the Lord in prayer before you're seated our Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for the opportunity to open back the pages of your word Lord Jesus as a human father God we're we're limited to what we can do father God but we know that there's no limited father it by you through your Holy Spirit Lord Jesus so father we would ask that you would just be the the one that speak tonight Lord God we invite your presence in our midst Lord and father God just stopped me from saying anything that I should not say Lord and open our ears of our understanding that we would hear what you would have want us to hear Lord God that we may grow to be more like you Lord for that's our desire Lord and I believe that's my brother and sisters desire Lord Jesus Lord Lord God Almighty we've done what we can father a studying and and labored father in your word now father God we just ask that you take the preeminence Lord Jesus you do the rest now in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ we commit this service into your hands now amen amen praise the Lord brother Terrence or Terrence sorry I let the I left a cup of water in the office that oh yeah yeah you can sit down oh sorry [Laughter] are you already seated down for work if you work a man phrase guy amen so tonight we want to we want to talk about this light now now reading here again in John chapter one thank you brother how we get a double portion oh wow thank you for the Bob appreciate it in in John chapter 1 here we see here that in the beginning was the word now when we read in Genesis chapter 1 it said in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth amen so who was there at the beginning of course we know that was Jesus Christ Jesus Christ all along amen praise God and the Bible says and the word was and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made amen and I like verse 4 in him was life and the life was the light of men so we see here that in this scripture that light and life are tied together when the scripture talks about light here in Genesis chapter 1 it's speaking about life as well amen because that's what God is they men God is life God is life amen praise God and we're going to just do a lot of reading and I just hope you all bear with me amen but we'll just do the best we can praise God you pray for me tonight amen and unto revelations chapter 3 verse 14 says and those I've gave I've given them some of these scriptures so they can bring them up so I want you all to read along as well I believe this is one of the ones that I gave them it says and unto the Angel of the Church of the Laodiceans write these things saith the Amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God so who is that beginning of the creation of God who was at the beginning Amen which it was the Lord Jesus Christ amen praise God and in Colossians chapter 1 verse 12 it says given thanks unto the Father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in life verse 13 who hath delivered us from the power of darkness amen because in Genesis chapter 1 as soon as the last unas God said let there be light darkness had to give way amen praise the Lord and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins aren't you thankful for that amen verse 15 I like this who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature now remember this is Jesus Christ the whole time for by him we were all things created they are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible now we're going to look at something just a little bit in just a little bit about that visible and invisible it's amazing how science has proven they're trying to disprove God but yet they're proving God amen I mean that that's just in it and it's all you know it's just like brother Branham said Satan is just a tool in the hands of God amen and so that's because man when they come face-to-face with God they just won't have an excuse they won't have an excuse and so for verse 16 for by him we're all things created are in heaven and on earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him now remember remember he is light praise God remember we're talking about light here not not now how to fish a life not just the light of the Sun we're talking about like equals life amen like equals life or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all thing and by him all things consist they men praise God so light in life we know there's connected and we know that both Jesus Christ is both that light and life now because Jesus is life the creation could not come about until if that light was not manifested first amen so in other words if God had not said let there be light remember that light is life nothing else could have come about after that there would have been no plants there would have been no no no dirt no trees no animals no nothing else and as where the d'void was bringing out all these things that were they were placed and on earth for example this pulpit comes from wood from elements that were already placed back when God said let there be light and all these all these different things when he said let there be trees and all these this was already there and there and so because Jesus Christ is the crew is the beginning of the creation of God if he didn't come out of God first then there could not have been anything else they meant praise the Lord Jesus now Genesis 1:3 it says and God said let there be light and there was light let there be light and there was light I mean because whatever he says has to come to pass right amen praise God so when God said let there be light there was like two things took place they meant the thought of God was expressed in Word form Amen Jesus Christ came out of God which is we know he's the logo amen and the other thing the second thing that came out was that light was manifested Jesus Christ which is he his life which produces life came out into manifestation amen praise God so it wasn't just let there be light and the Sun came out no because when you keep reading later on in that same chapter the Sun and Moon come out to come to come later on amen praise God I will get to that dear the moment and out brother branham said here in the smyrna church age i want to bring this you can bring that quote up he says down through these centuries we could go we find a Moses a Jeremiah a John the Baptist and each one of these where God's eternal thoughts expressed in its season you are expressed in your season as well amen don't think that you're here just to be here in this age or that you're here because Oh somebody something you might say oh I wish I was living in Luther's age or I wish I was living no you're here because God needed you here you're to express Jesus Christ to this world to this generation amen nobody else could take your place then we come to Jesus the logos he was the perfect and complete thought expressed and he became expressed and he became known as the word just as John 1 declares he meant that is what he is and forever will be remember he is light now it says that he has chosen us in him in Jesus before the foundation of the world that means that we were right there with him in the mind and thoughts of God before the foundation of the world so you were right there with him amen before God said let there be light and his thoughts amen I like this it says that gives an eternal quality to the elect Amen you can't get away from that praise God you can't get away a true child and son and daughter of God can't get away from the fact that they come from God and when that is revealed to you now see we're talking about your position to now we're talking about the bride amen right because that's what it boils down to amen recognizing your position recognizing who you are and what power that is bestowed in in you amen before the foundation of the world they met praise God let's bring up the Ephesians chapter 1 I was I was God I preached this message a few years ago and but you know as you grow and you see a little bit more you know you kind of start you kind of start seeing so and brother Wade was bringing out some things on Sunday that just kind of sparked sparked some of this a little bit better so thank God amen Ephesians one three five says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world amen the scripture says that about us the problem is is we have a hard time believing those things and because we don't believe that we can't act upon the authority that Christ has given us amen now I'm not just not to say that you don't believe it because you believe his word right but it's hard to think that's me it's hard to put yourself in that in that scripture that that's me that that's who Christ is talking about the crisis talking about you Amen that we should be holy and without blame before him in love you believe that you're without blame Amen no matter what I have done throughout the week no matter what has happened if it's under the blood I'm without blamed right amen now it's up to you if you're going to have it under the blood or not right that's between you and God but if it's under the blood I'm without blame before him amen having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen praise the Lord Jesus so you're you are part of that logos amen you are part of that part that came out of God amen when God you're just as much that that part of that logos as Jesus Christ was part of God amen now we know Jesus Christ that's not a second second person but that was just the son expressed Amen it's the same God amen praise the Lord Jesus and that's what God wants us to realize amen so there you being his child you being his child connected to Jesus Christ who is liked and who is life you can only manifest that as well a choose daughter and son of God can only manifest light in life amen because he is light in life if you come out of him that's the only thing that you can manifest amen is light in life now I'm going to read here let's bring up the next quote I believe I believe brother Wade read this one Sunday we're going to talk about Genesis 1:26 men here for just a moment now now if God created man in his own image and in his own likeness what kind of man did he create a spirit man now if you notice after he had made all the creation and created a spirit man the close reading of this now to the one to ask the question all right let's just scroll down see he was in other words Adam the first man in the lower creations of God the first creation was God himself then out of God came to logos all right I pay attention to this out of God came to logos that that was that low cost Jesus Christ which was the son of God then out of the logos which was the word in the beginning was the word in the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us out of the logos came forth the man now this man that he's speaking about is that Genesis 1:26 man a man that spirit man that who is that man I can't be nothing more but this but God himself and we'll read here in just a moment where brother Branham says that amen praise God because it's just as he has note that he has no limits no boundaries no nose no nothing this Genesis 1:26 men and we will read that here in just a moment I got some goodies man I was looking up some stuff and you know you you're getting weird and you tired of you know studying and then all of a sudden God just gives you something man and just gives you like my goodness issue right then just wakes you back up I didn't even need coffee I just I coulda leave that that that was just lame that was laying in there hey man praise God I hope it may maybe it was just for me may not bless you as much as it blessed me amen but I hope you get a blessing out everything man now there's a difference between this light of God that from Genesis 1 and in the light of the Sun Genesis 1 says that we were just read in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the water and God said let there be light and there was light amen so this is not this light here is not that light from Genesis 1:14 and through 18 it's totally separate light which is life amen now that light if you look up in the hebrew lexicon it they can bring that up that light in genesis 1 of 3 that word light it's the same word that was used for the other lights as well for describing the sun the moon the stars but I like this amen is that it is the light of day light of heavenly luminaries the Sun but if you go down it says light of life amen and then I like where it says Jehovah is Israel's life so Jehovah being that in other words a person if he meant he is that light Amen so that light was totally different from the from the Sun Moon and stars amen and then and we'll just read it here just a moment we'll read it now to bring up Genesis 1:14 says then God said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years and let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light or what upon the earth right they didn't say that in Jenna is one verse three but these lights right here are to give light upon the earth de mettre and it was so God's word amen and God made two great lights the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night he made the stars also amen and God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light where upon the earth so these were the heavenly celestial bodies they meant the sun the moon the stars amen totally different from that light from the beginning amen into rulers a and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness and God saw that it was good you see how important God he loves to divide in the beginning he divided the light from darkness and when he created the Sun the moon amen he made a division there as well one to rule the night one to rule the day amen but now the Sun the moon came from King can't produce its own light it gets the light from the Sun amen praise God amen so we're not going to beat that point there too we see that clearly Amen there in Genesis now just as the Sun and Moon there are further extensions of God right there are further extensions of when God said let there be light right amen further further extensions of his word of the manifestations of his word amen just as they are further extensions of God's Word the son of God and the bride or further extensions of God amen praise the Lord Jesus they're both the same you can't separate one from the other amen remember brother Branham he would he would talk about the Sun represent the represented by the Sun Esso and Jesus Christ amen and the bride is being represented by the moon amen praise God and so as the moon can't reflect her own light - amen its own life neither can the bride reflect her own light amen unless it's the light the light that she got from her begotten Amen that's the light that reflects now I don't know about you Amen but I don't want to reflect my own light amen I don't want to reflect my own word I don't want to I don't want to shine something that I came up on my own that's not what God is interested in amen I want to reflect what he has in mind amen I reflect the way he has placed me here to reflect which is his word amen that's what I want to reflect so this dying generation because the giant generation can't that they're not going to nothing's going to come about if I'm trying to show them my own thing amen but if I show them something that reflects from the mind of God amen from his light amen something can come out of that praise God I can't make a plant grow I neither can you and it's sort of tough to make a plant grow with artificial light and stuff but you put out a plant in there in the regular sunlight amen it just naturally it just grabs it gravitates to that light amen praise God same thing with the people out here in the world do you know that the people here in the world they want to see a true living Jesus Christ that's why they're looking at the young people they look at superheroes and Captain America and spider-man and all these different things because they want to be and they want to feel like superheroes they're looking for a superhero and the superhero is in their midst is trying to talk to them through you and me praise God that's that we're the true superheroes I don't go around carrying the shield and I don't go around care the things out of my wrist or anything like that amen I just have the word amen the word and if you manifest your word to the people amen you grab somebody amen amen you grab somebody with the word leave oh you grab somebody with a word you don't need spider webs or anything like that amen manifest the word don't be ashamed young people don't be ashamed I tell I told my daughter's I said I tell them I said don't be ashamed of Jesus Christ in school don't be ashamed of bowing your head to pray for your food because other people may wonder what he or he or she doing and then because they asked they may not have even seen that before and that's an opportunity for you to tell them and they're like hey I want to know more about that but a lot of us have in our minds that we think that they're just going to reject us and they're gonna think we're you know we don't want to be with them we don't want to hang out with it he prays before he eats that's your opportunity to show the world amen praise the Lord Amen now let's bring up let's talk about Adam and Eve and for just a moment praise the Lord how many are following Amen praise God let's bring up that the next quote which is the cruelty of sin and the penalty that it costs to rid sin from our lives brother Branham says here and then he created all his creations then after he made it all the trees come up and the plants and so forth what a beautiful setup he had he loved it it was beautiful and he thought that was fine now watch this so he couldn't just leave it in that state he had to leave something with it so he said let us plural make man plural in our own image let us make man in our own image so then when God made his first man he was a spirit man right he was something on the order of God or the Son of God the logos that was the first man then he gave the man jurisdiction over to lead all the animal life just like the Holy Spirit leads the believer today amen praise God my brother Wade said decide this uh this Sunday that he read a quote from 53 that was in 1953 amen next next next next quote I think brother Wade read this one on Sunday now the worlds without form and void and water was upon the deep we're in Genesis one now see then he made all the plant life then after a while he made man in his own image and if he made man in his own image he had to make him something of an order of that supernatural being a man this man this Genesis 1:26 men amen whoo-hoo you and me I meant if we're born again also came out of him just like that is a man we're destined to go back to that amen praise the Lord but this time with our bodies redeemed as well praise God now I think I think this one was the one that brother Wade rode the next the next one that's why the Bible says I'm sorry that's what about says the earth is groaning crying waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God the world is waiting for the man to come back into his riders state amen now he is made in the image and likeness of God that makes his when God made him God gave him some of his spirit part of his life amen and he's in in the likeness of the image of God amen so that man was just as much light as God his light amen praise the Lord so when Adam he came on the scene in spirit form he was we know that he was both male and female praise God and Eve was in him although she was not expressed but she was just as eternal as Adam was they meant they praise God amen now we're going to get to something here just a moment Genesis chapter 2 let's read Genesis chapter 2 verse 18 and the Lord God said it is not good that the man should be alone I will make him an help meet for him I like that that that that brought that that the Lord mentions this and watch what he does in the next scripture and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call him amen so instead of God given him his bride already he just puts Adam to work instead and I said revoir I preached a message a couple of years ago I think and said you know you young man you know you want a bride and you're looking for a wife you need to work first make sure you make sure you have a job you make sure you're seeking a wife make sure you have a task in hand because even God put Adam to put a task in hand before Eve was expressed amen then Eve came but Adam had to work first now it wasn't the sweat of his brow or anything but God gave him a task just as Jesus Christ and in John chapter 16 we'll read that later John 16 I believe or 17 when Jesus was praying he said Lord I've completed my work here amen and then it was after that amen after during his death that the bride and spirit spiritually came out of from his side amen praise God and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them not not what God would call them but to see what what Adam was call them amen because he knew that Adam and him Adam was not going to say anything outside of what he was thinking amen everything exactly that he was thinking God would just say amen praise the Lord and Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof period Genesis 220 and the Adam gave names to all cattle into the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field but for Adam there was not found and help meet for him so Adams is deer dealing with all the animals he sees that there's a male elephant and a female elephant a male dog and a female dog a male cat and a female cat a male duck and a female duck but he sees that his help meat is not dairy men praise God and and so in Genesis 2:21 it says and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh and so this is exactly what the Lord did for what the Lord did to our Lord Jesus Christ he put him to sleep as well because Jesus he died right well we know he slept and he died he was coming right back up amen it was only gone for a season Amen yet they had a ministry of work to do amen to release those Souls from prison amen praise God and the rib Genesis to 22 and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and I like I like the way the scripture presented and he brought her unto the man thank God just as God brought to Adam in the previous verses the animals to him to name God takes the rib God takes the bride or Eve out of his side and brings her to Adam and and it kind of reminds me of life went up when a when a groom is standing here waiting for his bride to come down the aisle you know he's all giddy she's so beautiful you know and the father is bringing her to him you know and they just thinking my that's my bride you know I can't imagine that's what god that's what Adam was thinking that's that's why God had for me amen but remember she was the whole time dwelling within him a man she was in him because Adam was male and female praise God the whole time was in but now she's been expressed amen praise God and Adam said this now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh don't you think that she was more born of a bone flesh of his flesh when she was in him but now he says now this is now bone of my bone flesh of my flesh after this after that she was expressed this is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh praise God and she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore saw a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh Amen so do you believe you're one with Jesus Christ amen praise God brother Branham says in the message God's provided way I appreciate them bringing all these scriptures all these quotes and things now there's no need of praying for it to be changed it can't be changed for God's done said it wouldn't be changed the only thing to do is save yourself from this generation by looking to Jesus Christ xx in him and be borned into God's provided way the baptism of the Holy Spirit amen listen he died on the cross and there he bled he was took upon himself the form of sinful flesh he died in my stead he was just God took out of the side of Adam a rib and made a bride to him God opened up the side of Christ and taken out water blood and spirit for a bride further himself for Christ how beautiful amen and by one spirit not by one church membership by one spirit are we all baptized amen are we all baptized into one body and become members of that body amen praise God let's read the next one I know you might know these but good to refresh amen when Jesus suffered in that body he suffered because a man and woman are one person amen Eve was taken out of Adam and the church what happened God opened up the side of Adam and took out there a helpmate the bride and God opened up the side of Jesus at Calvary and took out the bride seat amen now now what's decided this is what I thought was interesting on I love this Jesus died at Calvary remember the bride was not taken from the body until the body was dead he had already died and they was going to break his legs and the Prophet said there will be not one bone broken so they done draw back the hammer to break a leg and a man run up with a spear and pushed it through his heart and water and blood came forth he was already dead she was already redeemed in the body by his death so there's no more suffering tribulation period for the bride CGT goes in praise god so that's that's one thing that types amen just as Jesus Christ was not going to suffer any Marmont he was already dead for a job but that but they was to fulfill the scripture that none of his bones were broken that bride was already coming out typing they meant that she was not going to suffer Amen before a bomb comes out and comes down Saints we're supposed to leave out of here amen praise God that's why I'm not afraid of what Russia will do that's why I'm not afraid of all these politics and all these things they men you know you all want to share things on Facebook and all these things up this is what I want to share tonight amen this is what I'm worried about amen I want to be like his look like him amen praise God because nothing of this world is going to deliver me it's going to give me a body change amen now let's talk about this uh have you heard of quantum mechanics before amen very interesting and it's something that Einstein delved into and as he was studying and he was looking and probing and he was you know he was nearing something but he just couldn't he couldn't get the spiritual aspect of it now Colossians chapter 1 and we read this earlier but let's look at it again Colossians chapter 1 verse 12 says given thanks unto the Father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light who hath delivered us from the power of darkness amen and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible God right this invisible God weak it cannot be seen but what was expressed through Jesus Christ amen and now we are expressing that invisible God amen praise the Lord the firstborn of every creature for by him we're all things created that are in heaven and on earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones and dominions or principalities or powers things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by all by all things by him all things consist now the the the basic rules of quantum mechanics is that everything is made up of little microscopic particles right there are these these things called quanta in quanta is the small fragments of atoms in other words Quantum's are made up of quanta and then atoms and then molecules are made up of atoms and then of course molecules is what makes up all matter whether it's living or nonliving and then everything that you touch is made up of molecules right and everything and all those molecules are made up of atoms and then all those atoms are made up of quanta amen praise God now okay every one of these uh of these quantum particles they are invisible they cannot be seen amen but yet they are making something visible and this is what scientists have have discovered there they're so small that they can they can they cannot be seen but yet they are making tangible things praise God now now I want you to listen to this it says that therefore all material objects are made up of invisible particles we do not fully understand how they operate but we now know this that everything we can see is made up of things that cannot be seen now what does the scripture say in Hebrews chapter 11 verse 3 it says through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God by the Word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear praise God so God has God has all this heat he showed this this to us before they even discovered quantum mechanics amen this was already laying in the word praise God amen now one of the things that that that that holds all these all these things together quante the the atoms the molecules in the matter is all held by light in other words light is what is what ties all these things or meshes all these things together praise God so pretty much you and I these this pulpit everything around us all pretty much is what it is what is it solidified light it's pretty what it is they meant so think about it things think about when God said let there be light and there was light you Jesus Christ was there you and I was there everything was there and God God had already everything was already there Amen when when I was when this life everything dwelt in him all the expression all the things that he had already thought of was already in that gut when God said let there be light and there was light amen because remember light is what life that light amen praise God amen so and I kind of look at it like this this light that light or that solidified like that light is God we know that amen Adams is Jesus Christ right Jesus Christ in the Bride of Christ already there praise God the molecules we can tie that with the spirit man amen they can come out after the logos amen which was Jesus Christ and that spirit man were also in there as well that Bride of Christ amen because we're all attributes in the mind of God as well praise the Lord even though it was just Adam in the spirit man that was expressed at that time we were there as well praise God objects and then after that the objects the matter atom which is atom the flesh man which is the Bride of Christ as well amen the things that we can touch amen which is our flesh amen praise the Lord Jesus it's all tied up all tied up by light amen all these things are all tied by light and scientists have discovered that and they cages can't seem to get any further they get to a certain point and if they could just read the Bible and find Christ and and how and how simple Amen Christ is praise job I tell you what we'd be the world would be in a different condition Amen praise the Lord and so you know although we were invisible we were in God amen just as Eve was an Adam Amen now she wasn't visible she was not she was not visible but she was an Adam a man praise God that's why all these things they meant this quanta and these atoms and all these things there are they're invisible but they're all there because without these things science has proven you can't have this pulpit you can't have these physical things all these parts are not there amen praise God so light was created first nothing can be made without light right and everything is made up of unseen particles that's kind of strange that things are made up of things that are not seen amen but it's science amen and God had already declared that as we read there in Hebrews and science has proven that amen so the Bible was right before science was if you man praise the Lord now let's read let's read here at the right time tom is no more brother [Laughter] praise God now let's read the next quote bride in Christ that questions and answers how will it take place and and when is where is where is the where is it the bride goes this is the question a question that was given to brother Branham he says it goes to glory heaven for the wedding supper Justin type like Isaac and Rebekah when Rebecca went to meet Isaac remember alleles are represented now the message that went forth from Abraham Eliezer went forth to find a bride for Isaac he found a beautiful Rebekah in the cool of the evening a little dark-skinned girl coming out with a water pot on and Eliezer prayed said Lord give me good journey now and success for my master Abraham and he said go don't take him amongst his people now I like this showing that the Bride of Christ and Christ is blood relationship amen because Rebekah and Isaac were cousins amen praise the Lord Jesus amen so we're just we we have his blood amen we have his DNA we have all that he is we are praise God amen if you can of brother gene brother gene in Anderson South Carolina he would say if you can just phantom that if you can just fathom that amen if you could just if you could just think about that amen we wouldn't be so so sleepy of who you are amen of who you really are amen I was telling the brothers Sunday I think it was brother Don I was saying you know the same blood that flowing through my head right now is the same blood that's flowing down in my feet right now the same blood that's flowing through my legs is the same blood that's flowing through my arms amen it's all the same blood and it's the same blood amen that's flowing through the body of Christ amen the same DNA the same makeup the same everything amen that's why we can say he has confidence in us to say what he says amen and not speak outside of what he said amen because the Bride of Christ will only speak his word amen praise God now Genesis chapter 1 verse 4 says thing and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness amen so God said let there be light in verse 3 and he saw that light and he said this is good said this is this is great this is what this is wonderful this is this is Who I am amen praise God God thought that it was good after Jesus the logos was revealed they men came came into manifestation Amen we know brother Browns preached that message Christ at the mystery of God revealed so let's look at it this way when God saw the light you could say and God saw God that it was good right brother Fidel I want to be corrected if I'm wrong amen if any of this doesn't sound right I want to be corrected amen and God saw God that it was good now first John 1:5 says God is light and in him is no darkness at all right but now let's bring it a little further it said and God saw Jesus Christ that it was good amen remember that that light is life amen john 8:12 says i am the light of the world jesus jesus speaking he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of Life amen praise God well let's bring it down a little bit further and God saw the bride that it was good amen and Ephesians 5:8 says for ye were sometimes darkness remember there was all this darkness a man before God said let there be light amen but you were sometimes darkness but now are ye light in the Lord not that you have the light but now are ye light in the Lord so walk as children of light praise God amen I don't know about you but I you know the script that's what I see in that scripture amen praise God amen hallelujah I just thank God that's why that's why didn't need any coffee amen praise God now 1st Thessalonians 5 5 says ye are all the children of light and the children of the day amen we are not of the night nor of the darkness amen so God after he said there be light and there was light and God saw that the light was good and then in the next verse he says and he's in the first day and then the day and the night was the first day it really is something like that yeah something something like I think we'll read it here in just a moment so you are children of the day you're not children of the night that's all we don't hang around nightclubs cockroaches hang around nightclubs you know now you know the people they are they are blinded you know that they're Satan has had a grassland you know I was in that I was in that position at one point in time you know I was a I was a although I was in the mind of God I was I was I was I was predestinated to come to this but I was expressing darkness at some point in time I used to love the nightlife sneak out of the house and go do things I shouldn't be doing amen but see God changed me Amen from that and God has done the same thing for you and I a man changes from looking at darkness to looking now at day at day time a man I'd liked praise the Lord Jesus so now we're going to talk about God bringing the separation between light and darkness real quick because after God brought that light into manifestation what does he do immediately in verse four he says and God divided the light from darkness amen and that the Hebrew the Hebrew word there in the Hebrew lexicon is four divided is Badal which means to divide separate to divide separate sever sever to separate set apart there's a lot of different to be separated to withdraw from two separate oneself on two to be excluded and then so this a little darkness was to be excluded from the life amen you take kena can this door be open for the way yeah I don't know if I'll come back now let's just say it was dark in here right I saw all right now you see it's dark in here right we just have a little bit of glimmer of light now if I open this door what takes over the light takes over the darkness does not go outside it's the light that takes over amen praise God there for good sorry Billy we don't want y'all to go into REM mode you know where we you know you're sleepy now you know start dreaming if I leave those lights off praise God but light has to darkness has to give way when light comes in amen darkness cannot stand in the presence of light therefore when you as a Christian Amen you as a son and daughter of God you're standing out here in this middle of this darkness out here in this world amen darkness has to give way when the Son of God comes on the scene they men praise God when a son of God a man goes and shows towards the light who is Jesus Christ working through him darkness must give way amen praise God sickness must give way amen all these things must give way that have to do with darkness praise God now John we're going to read here a few scriptures just to kind of solidify this amen in 2nd Corinthians chapter 6 verse 14 because light and darkness cannot dwell together says be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness there's no communion with light in darkness John 1:5 says in the light shyness in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not Amen we read that scripture earlier in Ephesians 5:11 it says and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them hey man praise God amen see because you're a light bear amen you're the one that's holding the torch Amen though the Lord Jesus Christ remember that that that that that story that brother Branham tells when they were in in a in a cave or something like that and and the little boy was scared because the light went out amen and they demand the man says don't worry or the person says don't worry there's a man here they can turn on the light amen he's on the scene st. you have nothing to worry about praise God hallelujah amen hmm light has to be separate from darkness first John one five and seven says this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth in other words if you're a hypocrite I was bring it down straight but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin now because he is like and that light is dwelling of you in you and me that's the reason why we have fellowship one with another remember as the Adams and a a a and all these things are tied together by light we are also tied together by this light as well praise God amen Genesis 1:5 and now we just read the oh yes and God called the light day in the darkness he called night in the evening in the morning were the first day right first Thessalonians five five you're all children of light in the children of the day we are not of the night nor of darkness in last scripture here first Peter 2:9 but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood those are powerful words amen and holy nation you are the nation praise God a peculiar people so I the world doesn't understand you can't understand me you know this afternoon I was there's a cleaning lady that that cleans in our offices and she's a Christian she's from Cuba very interesting lady to talk to because she loves the Lord she's a Christian and she tells her testimony and she talks about how she came out of the communist mindset that they have down there in Cuba we're pretty much a lot of people are just atheists but now there's Christianity that that is there and so she said how God was dealing with her and just telling me all these things and she loves the Lord and I was kind of she saw she saw I was telling her because she knows that I'm a minister and I was telling her yeah I had to minister tonight and I was sort of sharing these things with her you know just a little bit you know and of course you know coming from a nominal background you know she just can't grasp everything Amen but she has a certain point of understanding she doesn't reject it though you know but she has a certain point of understanding amen and and so I'm just thankful that God just takes us amen and we've all started all at that point as well you know that's why I don't I don't look down on people who think II can't understand you know the things that you God has given you amen and given me to understand in this hour amen in the word the world doesn't talk about body changes much and in about Resurrection much and about they don't they don't know a lot about all these things that you and I know amen but that's what we don't look down on people that way for as God so what was I going on with that but you're a chosen generation a royal priesthood an holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into the marvelous light hallelujah amen now listen to this this quote brother Branham brother Branham says here in the message do you now believe he this isn't a prayer line I believe it is and all of you even in there being prayer now I mean in silent prayer you can watch until I ask you to about our let's go down he says now but if there's any sickness may maybe you got something I don't know maybe you got cancer maybe you got some kind of female trouble I don't know what it is but whatever it is that's a disease which is the devil of the darkness amen that's right it's of darkness it's not of light sickness is of darkness to kill you God is like who brings life already man praise God amen so you don't have to accept the the works of the devil amen you don't have to accept sickness in your life you don't have to accept anything that the devil puts on you you don't have to accept that your children are not saved you don't have to accept that none of these things that come from darkness praise God because you are children of light and the Bible commands us to walk that way amen claim what's rightfully yours claim what's rightfully yours sings Amen Colossians 1 verse 12 says given thanks unto the Father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light who has delivered us from the power of darkness he has already bring we have already been delivered from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son hallelujah it's already a work done work in the eyes of God thanks amen he's just wanting for you to catch up to that it's already he's already translated us they met a man he just wants you to believe that praise God and there's a kingdom of his dear son they meant see God wants you to see yourself the way he sees you amen he wants us to look at ourselves perfect the way he saw us before the foundation of the world hallelujah man if he could just look at the mirror of God's Word amen when you read this Bible I preached that message a while back about the mirror right when you read this Bible this Bible should be a mirror to you it shouldn't be something foggy it should be something that you cannot see clearly it should be a mirror you're joking at yourself right there everything that it's saying you're seeing you that is me from Genesis to Revelation no matter how you turn that mirror you're looking at yourself amen because this is you amen praise God hallelujah and if you can look at yourself in that manner Saints say in this powerless and what brother ways been bringing out lately if you can come to that to that but those we're bringing out that revival if you can just if you can if you can if you can realize that amen then then when death starts creeping up your arm you know you can shake it right off amen right just it right off a mint because it has no power over you if we could just have that reveal to us Saints it's in the word it's in the mirror all we just needed the revelation of it praise God and you know what brother does been bringing out late about about revival Amen I odd I was just having a revival in the car today a little revival that the world has knows nothing about but I'm there in the car and they probably thinking there's a man there with sunglasses on and he's just driving and he's just you know but I'm having a revival in my heart it's a quiet thing that the world knows nothing about that's what God is doing in his bride right now amen praise the Lord amen let's continue here real quick in the message three kinds of believers and we all know this story so the little boy one time down here in Kentucky raised way up in the mountains he had never been around where there was a lookingglass he had a little piece tacked up on a tree but he had never seen himself he come here to Louisville it was told and stay with his mother's sister and she lived in one of the nice homes an old-fashioned home when they went up into one of the bedrooms that had a door that had a mirror all up it all way up down the door so there was one of those long mirrors that you can place on the door and when the little fellow started to running through the house he stopped he said he's running and all of a sudden and that little image was moving right and then he would do that and the image was moving too and then he would do that yeah acting like spider-man yeah and the image was moving to everything that he was doing he'd stick his tongue out and it stick his tongue out at you so everything that he was doing that mirror what image was moving and all of a sudden he goes in screams mom that's me that's in the mirror that was exactly what he was seeing he was seeing himself in the name I wish the word of god was excited us that way all right well we come we come to church and weird weird you know we're tired and we're sleepy and understand we have life because I get tired I get sleepy too but God is trying to tell us something amen there's last day Saints right amen and I believe you we were not placed here for for just to be here all right man you and I have a specific purpose to be in this church to be in this community to be in this state be in this country for me to be married to my wife and me from one part of the world and and and she came from the other side of the world and and yet God brings a Filipino and a Colombian together to make filling bein children I never thought of that neither did my mom and dad neither did is my wife's mom and dad ever think of that that was God that did that now God has all these things they meant for you to receive his word amen it all boils down to you know it boils down to this that's why it doesn't matter what's going on in the pool because the only thing that God cares is to fulfill his word and his bride that's how he cares about let it happen whatever happened takes place I don't care it's all to fulfill this word it's all to fulfill this for amen praise God so little Johnny saw little Johnny that's what brother Brown says see and he scratched his head and little Johnny in the mirror scratched his head he laughed a little Johnny and the mirror laughed he jumped up then down amen praise God so we know so and this is like when when God when when Adam said this is now bone of my bone flesh of my flesh Eve was Adam manifested in broad form everything that Adam was a believe was right there and God remember God brought it to him God brought her Adam I mean brought her Eve God brought him right there careful I say that especially nowadays yeah oh my and he the father brought in brought Eve to Adam and she looked exactly just what he was what he was amen just exactly praise God just expressed in the female version but remember that female version was already dwelling within him amen praise the Lord John 16 says and in that day ye shall ask me nothing verily verily I say unto you whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name he will give it you praise God so whatever Eve wanted Adam was willing to do for her Amen or whatever whatever Eve desired her desire was his command Amen praise God hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name ask and ye shall receive that your joy may be full these things have I spoken unto you in Proverbs but the time cometh when I shall no more speak unto you in Proverbs but I shall show you plainly of the father I love this scripture because it says at that day ye shall ask in my name and I say not unto you that I will pray the Father for you in other words what is whatever you say he's not going to stand in the way of what you wanted was whatever you say or whatever you say amen for the father himself loveth you because ye have loved me and he believed and have believed that I came from God praise God so it's it's whatever you say Saints but again remember you're not going to say anything outside of his word therefore he could say that and he has that full confidence in you praise God now let's read this quote I thought it was really good other BAM says here and I saw new heavens and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth was passed away and there was no more sea this is from Revelation revelation 21 I believe I John saw the holy city descending from God out of heaven as a bride adorned for her husband remember in this bride behold the tabernacle of God is with man and God shall dwell with them upon this pyramid-shaped City 1,500 square miles and in the top of the city there will be a light amen oh that there'll be a light amen amen oh that City on mountains down he starts singing that song amen now let's keep let's keep reading the next part of it on top of Mount Zion will set the lamb and the city will need no light for the lamb is the light thereof the lamb is the life thereof amen pretty good and and above the lamb will be the father which is the logos but I thought Jesus Christ was the logos [Laughter] this both the same God the Great God the great light amen the eternal light that will shine just above the throne right and Jesus and Jesus will not be on his Father's throne he'll be on his throne amen and the father will hover over the son which the father and son will be one they are one and while they are listen to what brother Branham says here I thought this was ending and while they are yet speaking all answer before they can think I'm thinking for them that's right even I don't know it comes brother bread but that's the truth amen we have the same mindset I came out of the Father amen I came out of the logos you came out of the logos and whatever he says whatever he's thinking remember when Adam was naming the animals that's exactly lordose thinking Adam I can't I can't I can't deny that praise God amen the question is are you ready to see yourself the way God sees you amen let's not make this a routine let's not make Church reading the word studying as a routine amen because it's so easy for us to get into a routine and we get stuck in that routine and we think that that if that's that's just it that is the routine and that someday like brother Dale says the you know waiting for the bus to pull up the bus might come and you and you you stay you'll miss it we don't want to miss it since we don't want to miss it now now let's talk real quick I think let's talk about cook about this New Jerusalem Amen coming down from God as a bride the brother brother branham mentioned that here revelation 21:1 says and I saw a new heaven we just read it but we worry and I saw a new heaven and new earth for the first heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there were no more see and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband amen so as Eve came out of Adam Amen as a bride right as we the bride spiritually came out of Jesus Christ amen and here comes the bride again coming out of God again coming out of this eternal city praise God because it says in I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband amen amen you know Jesus said I come from God and I go back to God amen see the the bride it comes out of God goes back to God but then comes back down again with Jesus to reign eternally in the future home amen praise God now let's keep reading in revelation 21:3 and I heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God praise the Lord Amen hallelujah so that bride a man that life as Jesus Christ is the light thereof amen will be the light with him just as much amen in that eternal city praise God now let's read this next quote amen I think I'm making good time we're almost done but he's got to be a good one to end with brother Branham says hear questions and answers and John said I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem descending from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband there you are there he said the wife the Lamb and the bride will be there forever there'll be a new earth millions of millions of square miles of Mother City and he keeps talking he's talking about the city the details of the city let's go and says there's the 20 and for elders there's the bride there's the forty and four thousand the temple eunuchs oh brother were going somewhere things lay ahead for us amen the for the twenty and for elders the 144,000 eunuchs the bride setting with Christ my you talk my home sweet home amen visca it's not just you're sitting on the throne with him amen you're sitting in his domain with him amen to think that I have the privilege of going there and you have the privilege of going there and why would you choose to walk in this darkness and see no life and die and go into chaos and become nothing why would you want that right for when light takes a supreme authority there's no place for darkness go find where the darkness went when light comes amen what happened to the darkness amen when we open that door they had to give way right for when light takes the supreme authority there's no place for Darkness go find where the darkness went when the light comes that's the way it is when all things are turned back to God that had darkness had a beginning so even though darkness was there with a Bible in Genesis 1 it says there was darkness but it had a beginning right in the beginning right darkness had to begin and darkness has an end praise God light never had a beginning because God like God is like amen light never had a beginning or it never has an end therefore you have no beginning and you have no end amen God never had a beginning or never has an end amen so someday the whole d-bots world with all of its sin and its beauty so called and all of its fantasticks and sensations and all of its glamour and everything will fade out into nothing and it will be no more because remember God is going to burn all this sin sin off of this earth everything that we see here on this earth all these all these uh all these things that there is Satan's domain and this is Satan's Kingdom all these are civilizations and all these things amen that's not what God had in his mind amen but we know that God had a plan they meant it'll be no more no more thought of it said even it won't even come into the remembrance anymore praise God hallelujah so so who is the bride it's God Himself is the light right God Himself manifested you are his bride sing you are his light you are the light of the world Jesus saying you're more than what you think that what Satan would want you to think that you are you're not just a Christian lowly barely making it day-to-day yes if I could just get out of bed oh my brother dick you brother dicks that's you're not destined for that for eternity your ears that's not a disease because I get it too and I'm 30 I'm only 36 and now ma'am I don't want to make some of you jealous no no that but Saint but see I'm not in the age that I'm supposed to be when we get young again we're young again so I'm passed you know I think we were talking about the Jo the other day I was talking about the young the young people the boys you know they think they're just wrong and basketball and everything and they're invincible and and Bella the other day was saying Oh mommy I can't wait till I'm 15 you know I know once you get once you get to it and you get to about 25 you're gonna wish you were back to 15 again yeah but yeah you know but but saying to all these things that we see now they're not here to stay God's gonna destroy it but make it all new again him and everything that he thought of from the beginning amen it's going to be restored amen and it has started with you and I Amen that's why the Bible says that the creation is groaning and travailing for the manifestation of the sons of God amen so when God saw the light he saw himself he got excited when God saw Jesus Christ he got excited when he saw you he got excited amen excites him I hope you just excited about it as he is he's thrilled to death that he had the privilege to reveal his word to a people that come out of him amen that they will think exactly like camera that will say nothing outside of his work amen how many love the Lord tonight thank God type the musicians come up [Applause] amen praise the Lord let's just let's just uh we'll
