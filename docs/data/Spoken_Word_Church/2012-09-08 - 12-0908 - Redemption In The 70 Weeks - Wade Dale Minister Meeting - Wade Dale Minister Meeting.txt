========================================

put it in Pocket now young Dr Wade Dale well you got both barrels now you get the half pound so or bless each and every one of you thank you for being attentative we are lucky and privileged to be living in this end time that where God can show us things and he can reveal to us the secrets the in between the lines the things that he he he wants to tell us and I think that's what these 70 weeks are all about Dad covered the Daniel 70 weeks chart which I have the letter from Brother George Smith I'll go ahead and call his name brother George Smith's wife is the one who drew this for brother Bram you know that amen all right not this one but the one dad showed but I'm going to use this one it's exactly the same way we're just putting little emphasis points in there okay is that all right go this the same all right brother George Smith said it is accurate she just added a few little things which was the cross was not connected it was setting up in the air and she connected it just some little things she did not change anything that that brother brandham preached on during the 70 weeks so I hope you understand it what the two things we were trying to do what D did is he was showing you that the chart the Bible and the quotes from The Daniel 70 weeks book are correct they fit what you believe it or not they fit amen he showed it to you from the Bible and prophet's message and the chart that they fit now what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you that I'm going to show you the parable the underlying meaning or redemption in the 70 weeks because if you can't see redemption in everything that we do if you can't see Redemption then you're still lost amen but if you see Redemption that means you're redeemable right you can be redeemed So Daniel 9:24 70 weeks are determined upon thy people now look we're going to C something that maybe you've never heard before and that's okay cuz remember I'm his son so I've heard it as long as he's been preaching it but we're going to look and break it down into three different groups and we'll show you in just a minute but I want you to look at this I've never heard anyone number one preach on Daniel 7 weeks except dad and brother Claude wer out in Oklahoma and myself just not been around maybe but look what it says 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city right there's a Redemption to the city amen as well as the people exactly all right to finish to do what six things to finish the transgression making of sin reconciliation for iniquity bringing Everlasting righteousness seal up the vision prophecy and anoint the most holy and I'm going to ask you right now cuz I'm going to throw some points in here and I'm going to I'm going to go a little bit faster probably than that is did but do we all agree that the six-fold purpose happens in the 70 weeks of Daniel Amen oh yeah right agree or disagree it's the Bible amen it's the Bible Bible says 70 weeks are determined upon thy people who the Jews the Holy City Jerusalem to do what six things keep this in mind six seals finishes our Redemption sixfold purpose finishes their Redemption amen amen all right and we'll parallel that in just a few minutes so scrolling them up to a parable we're going to read this again but we're going to read one that Dad didn't read it's a metaphor it's a metaphor or metaphorically is a comparing or comparison of one thing with another likeness or similitude an example of by which a Doctrine or precept is Illustrated right all right so now let's go to the first quote and read just in the highlighted areas now I don't have this I don't have the quotes for you to have I've got some but but we're taping this and you're welcome to have it it is public domain you don't have to call us and ask for a copyright that was a joke God wrote it in riddles okay I guess we're supposed to be real serious today yes I don't have many serious bones in my body God's wrote it in riddles and Parable so that he could hide it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and reveal it to babies such as will learn all right that's go number three in the 70 weeks of Daniel now we know the scripture cannot lie now some of these Dad read but we're going to read them over again you know what it takes 17 times before you can remember something right right we got you twice 15 more times and we'll get you yeah so now but see also though if you look at it visually you you can reduce that okay now we know the scriptures cannot lie they have to be truth and if this Angel Gabriel came and told Daniel that there's only 70 weeks left for the Jews now we would apply that to 6 days or 7 Day weeks but in Prophecy it's always given in Parables now I want to go to one Parable and we if we have time at the end this really excuse me my voice is going out somebody get me some water watch this in Genesis here is your parallel this is a very wonderful Parable and Jacob loved Rachel and said I will serve the seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter what does 27 say fulfill her week right brother br's not the only one that come up with one week equal 7 years it's in the Bible people it's in the Bible brother R can't get anything outside of the Bible amen fulfill her week amen thank you Bab appreciate that fulfill her week what seven years and we will give thee this also for the service which now sh sered with me yet seven other years we'll get to the rest of the story in just a minute but if you'll remember he got the older one right Leah amen the older one yeah Rachel was the one he already had his eye on he was already looking at Rachel he was wanting Rachel he was wanting the bride he was wanting the Gentile bride but he got Israel first right right think about this now until until we get finished Rachel had two children yes Joseph and who represent Parable wow all right let's go so now we're going to look at Redemption of three groups of people number one is going to be the Gentiles that's us two we're going to see Israel which make that plain 144,000 and thy holy C cuz didn't it say that didn't it say thy holy city 70 weeks are determined upon the people and the city because Jerusalem has been destroyed some 17 times even since since Jesus's time so since Titus destroyed it they just destroy that place and and just keep destroying it all right let's go so we're going to keep that in your mind cuz watch and I saw when for all the cause whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away and give her a bill of divorce yet her treacherous sister Judah fear not but went and play the Harlot also return ye back sliden children that's Jeremiah 3:22 and I will heal your backsliding behold we come unto thee for thou art the Lord Our God all right I'm starting with Israel Israel backslid committed adultery and what did he do he gave her a bill of divorcement and what put her away right but he says I cannot forget her he's not going to forget her it's like Dad said if that if it were true this line would go over here and you and I wouldn't be in the picture exactly but he wanted a gentile bride so he had to that's the engrafting folks of the of the branch right the engrafting of the Gentiles all right so Redemption three people Gentiles 144,000 and we must bring the city into view all right let's go number four now now that let's outline Daniel 70 of week now I might repeat here again Ministers of the Gospel if you disagree with this all right they are divided into three periods now does everybody SE three periods on the board yes a 7 a 62 and a seven right now that's Bible That's Bible yeah right amen that's the prophet's message and that's that chart amen that first the seven we period Then a three score and twoe which is 62 and then a onee period they're divided into three different periods now I've got it divided here on the board the first period second period and to my understanding by the gospel by the holy spirit that the end time God returns again to the Jews now you can say what you want to I think he's pointing to that last week that's what he's pointing at amen what else would he be pointing at that's when he returns to the Jews he's not right it's not right here it's right here right God returned again the Jews now we know all about the gospel that Paul taught and others that God return again to the Jew well then if he's going to return again to the Jew how can we apply it back in Daniel's time we've got to apply it in this last age amen and it's after the Gentile church has been gone cuz he deals with Israel as a nation we as an individual all right number five now here we go again now this I'm going to go over it just real briefly because Dad went over it real well and and I hope you get it because it's very very important now Jesus Messiah wrote Into the City of Jerusalem Triumph on the back of a white mu on Palm Sunday April the 2nd ad30 Jesus rode in Jerusalem on Palm Sunday ad30 and now from BC 445 to ad30 is exactly 475 years now we've he he's already covered that April the 2nd we prove 830 is on also here right that's where brother Brown Put 8030 right he didn't put 33 he put 830 and a cross right yes that's where Jesus died on the cross in ad30 all right now let's go to the next one now but remember this then Pro then prophets will prophesy 1,23 score days which is in the midst of the last week of the Jews now I want to bring this to a point right here you're going to see something that maybe you've never seen before inside here is a meaning that maybe you've not looked at before cuz if you read the book it is confusing but I'm going to prove by the sixfold purpose that that last week has to happen but see brother R in the Daniel 70 weeks book says week of the Jews he even calls it the Jewish week right he never called it a messiah week right he called it a Jewish week a Jewish week a week of the Jews everybody got it so far amen all right then they're cut off now look after three that's where they prophesy right there right yeah then they're cut off and then what did he say and the Armageddon sits in all right so now let's go to the next one now someone brought this to my attention the other day watch if you want to get technical about it and after three score in two weeks shall Messiah be cut off after 62 weeks right there right shall Messiah be cut off and the people of the prince shall come and destroy the city in sanctuary all right and then thereof the flood and end War desolation someone said well after means that's where you get your people say that 830 is when he started his ministry and after pre St in two weeks so you got three and a half brother R never preached that it's not in the Bible and you don't have a quote for it right so it's ning void after if I'm going we're going to eat after this is over that's only an hour from now on March the 14th is when the edct went forth to rebuild right 445 BC March the 14th Jesus was crucified on April the 7th according to what the prophet said April the 2nd was Palm Sunday he was dead on Friday right right right five more days this is Elementary all right so there's no time after he died April 7th ad30 uh you know I'm like d said I've got stacks of papers where where 830 is used many many times and we saw in that uh where he put it on there 803 excuse me 833 is used because is using another calendar but to make the 483 years you got to stop at 8030 you can't have 3 and 1/2 more years right are the Bible's wrong the prophets wrong and the quotes are wrong all right so three is a witness so now if we see this and we're going to assume that after three score and two weeks so after March the 14th if you carried all the 62 weeks after March the 14th in ad30 he was crucified April the 2 well that was after March the 14th right so after 62 weeks could have just been one day after 62 weeks the messiah's cut off all right now here is where you're just going to have to go with me for a minute Jesus started his ministry we proved there a few minutes ago on the River Jordan when he was becoming 30 years old is that correct right 29 and a half now he was 33 years old when he died right the chart Pro that BC 4 4 BC even Usher in your Bible Usher and several other commentaries prove that because of Herod being Ding and all that that Jesus was born 4 BC so 4 BC to 8030 is exactly 33 years so he was 33 years old when he died so he started his ministry three and A2 years before that right amen simple prise the Lord River Jordan 3 and 1/2 years later so you would say October probably ad26 he started his ministry preached three and A2 three preached three and 1/2 years died at 33 years old in April there is your first three and A2 years of Messiah Ministry amen I want you to listen to my words Messiah ministry right I didn't say Jewish I said Messiah Ministry amen not after the cross he can't preach while he's dead because roll it because look even this proves it then Peter call said Lord how off shall we daddy read this but I'm going to read it again I say how how many forgive forgiveness is redemption right right if you're forgiven you're redeemed right amen right Peter then how can I forgive him till seven times Jesus said no 70 * 7 which is 490 if there's 483 years to right here gentlemen there's one week left that's seven years to finish the 490 years correct right this means yes yes sir amen okay you can nod a little louder if you want to and I can hear you so he was cut off April the 7th ad30 Isaiah 53 proves all that also we don't have time to get into it uh the sixfold purpose um man you can lay those right in with the seals but we'll try to do something with them in just a few minutes that maybe it will help you all right so now let's look at Redemption we've come up to this point because Redemption didn't start we know Redemption was over before the foundation of the world okay but it had to be applied at Calvary amen had to be applied at Calvary amen it wasn't received it was applied pardon is not a pardon unless it's accepted as a pardon all right so now now remember he was cut off the side Jew God ceed to deal with them they did not go any farther then they were scattered by the Roman Empire and have you noticed on my chart here that says what ad 70 I want you to get this now and draw it you notice here where I got the cross that's where they rejected but the time extended out just a little bit further on that see why 30 40 50 60 70 he didn't start at 3 and 1/2 and go 26 and a half he's going whole years 30 years 40 50 60 70 40 years later Titus the Roman general destroyed Israel Jerusalem and Scattered the people all over the world you see tius 40 years later that can't be 833 as far as what the prophet is telling us right by this chart and by the calendar it had to be 830 because you've messed up to ad70 you're you don't have 40 years into the into Titus destroying Rome you see Titus I mean destroying Jerusalem Titus 40 years later so actually the Jewish time extended till the complete God wasn't dealing with them he only dealt with them until they rejected Christ then they crucified Christ they said let his blood be on us and our children that's what their problem's been the whole time all right we'll get into that on sixfold purpose because he's got to redeem that back yes he's got to redeem that group back right let his blood be on us and our children and it's been ever since but before they got scattered listen old brother before they got all scattered to all the world it took God about 40 years to tear up the temple that's where the holy City's got to come from sure they're going to establish Temple worship here on Earth but Jesus well God in the scripture says sacrifice and offerings thou wouldest not but a body these offerings have become a stink in my nostril God is not going to bless natural Israel over there right now trying to do Temple worship cuz God's not there God's not there they're going to establish Temple worship they're going to kill the goat they're just waiting on the red heer right now and from and from what we're reading on the internet they're within just a few hairs of getting that red heer genetically and you know where they're raising them United States yeah we anyway you can go any way with that if you want to but they're going to they're going to try to establish Temple worship and they will brother Rand I'll read you a quote right here they're going to when we're out of here they're going to establish Temple worship but now they're not going to the 144,000 is not going to amen that's what's going to get the 144,000 killed right the Jews have spent all these 2,000 years trying to get everything together and they're going to start making sacrifices and there's going to be a group of people a bunch of nuts are going to walk in the temple and go hey God's not there anymore he's right here he's right here yes and they're going to hate them 144,000 the Jews are going to kill them the people United States is not going to kill them their own people's going to kill them right old brother Butz they got all scattered it take God 40 years to tear up the temple and scatter them out to all the world but now remember if this is not true God Waits four script four chapters in The Bible in Ezekiel 40-44 brother said that was the Millennium temple being built not to make sacrifices anymore right but remember the Millennium is for the Jews right we're there in a honeymoon we don't go down there and build anything all right but we'll get into that in a minute but God failed to deal with them anymore God failed to deal with them anymore he went dealing with us right you know that understand it now now here we start in the church AG is the Gentile time God away from the Jews now there's your seven Church ages we don't need to go into that because you and I are a part of that amen all right let's go to the next one in the 70 weeks God showed John exactly what would take place during the Gentile Reign now we haven't got any time limited time like the Jews but we got a sign right we got a sign post what God did with the Jews that's exactly what he said he would do in them six 69 years are 483 years but 69 weeks and one week left one week's yet determined to the Jews right exactly now we cannot apply it in here I believe he's poting right here cuz this is Gentile right all right so the whole week's got to be after we're gone that's right dealing with the Jews GL not the Messiah we you there's going to be a difference and I'll show it to you in just a second now this is Revelations beginning with the first chapter to the third chapter takes us over what to lay a all right let's go right I'm not going to I'm not going to use any of my notes Here I had some notes to read off but I'm not going to read them off I'm just going to keep doing this okay now what happened look over the top of this last Church age see this little extension I want you to remember here is another key if you want to write this down key number one was thy city right key number two is lap over amen MH how many times you're ministers you're not lady you're ministers amen how many times did Brother Brown say lap over yes sir many how do you build a step you got to lap it over the first one to get to the next one right so lap over lap over we're going to see like the battle of Armageddon folks the battle of Armageddon is not going to be a one day battle right amen that's an atomic battle that's going to last for a for a length of time that's right all right that's where all this is going to come in right here but we'll look at it this thing now what's happened look up over the top of this last Church J see this extension the Gentile days are finished and for the last 40 years the Jews has been returning now that little lap over is right there got it the Jews have been returning to Jerusalem going back to the Homeland see where we're at it took 40 years from the cutting off of the Messiah to Titus destroyed the temple and Scattered the Jews then it spend another 40 now to get the Jews back together all right let's go to the next one now our Kinsman is handed the seven seal book of redemption right kind of funny he's talking about Redemption and it's talking about Gabriel's instruction to Daniel he's showing us a parable here and the lamb came and took the book out of the right hand and sent up upon the throne who was the lamb the Redeemer our kinsman redeemer the Kinsmen to the church who come and redeemed Israel yes now we're going to get into that this morning Israel was redeemed but it was not applied to them cuz they rejected him but the church received their Redemption amen we received that 3 and 1/2 year Ministry amen right amen they were blinded from that 3 and 1/2 year Ministry we received that 3 and 1/2 year Ministry and if I have enough time I'm going to show you that it parallels with the last part of brother Brown's Ministry the Revelation exactly see that really there's only 3 and 1/2 years that Jesus preached he didn't preach 7 years that's right he only preached 3 and 1/2 years okay sir but but like with Rachel and Leah he worked seven years so you got to have seven years here you got to have seven years here uhhuh for Redemption of us and for Redemption of Israel all right so we'll show that just a second as the Lord will it Israel was redeemed but it was not applied to them because they rejected him but the church received their Redemption and he is our kinsman redeemer as Boaz had to redeem Naomi in order to get Ruth the moabit is an alien Gentile so Christ redeemed Israel applied to rede Redemption and was rejected amen and Jesus redeemed Israel in Calvary but it was not a pardon to them because they did not receive it as the pardon but in our lesson now on these 70 weeks we find they come back and receive their pardon yeah but he redeemed the church when we are pardoned because we have received the blood of Jesus Christ as our pardon everybody okay with that amen okay this all should be old hat but it's kind of tying everything together showing you Redemption through the 7 weeks of Daniel now Pentecostal Brethren how can we apply it all over here in the last Church age that's us they're sleeping through every one of these ages waiting and we which you're alive the little remaining Bunch remain alive until the coming of the Lord will not hinder those which are asleep for the trumpet of God shall sound the dead in Christ shall rise first and we should be caught up together with them amen with them here we are meeting right here to go to meet the Lord in the air what's he saying right here right rapturing Saints right all this right here amen and there you are where we at right here where did the Messiah get cut off exactly where the word said right here right where will that 70th Week begin exactly after this church is cut off right then God returns to the Jews amen the next thing in order is the coming of the kingdom of God you remember as soon as the church age goes and the Jews take hold they come in but first and thing in order is not a mighty nation or a national Revival the next thing in order for us is the coming of the kingdom of God the coming of Christ amen all right I want you to look at Point number two before we go to the next step we receive somebody said and brother Bill and I were sitting in a meeting last weekend and a brother a well-known brother made a comment that I don't know why everybody's making such a big deal about the 70 weeks of Danel because it's to the Jews well let's forget about the themselves too yeah right let's throw our seal book Away uhuh seals are not to us right from Revelations 4:1 to 19 is not to us amen all right but we get the spiritual application to get us out of here that's it if we don't take it and put it all together there's a gap and when there's a gap there's fear when there's fear there's doubt when there's doubt there's no body change right we got to be standing with perfect Faith glory to take a body change the next thing in orderers to come into kingdom of God the coming of Christ all right let's go to the next one now when when's God going to start their last week when it may be today it may be before the sun sets in sets tonight God will declare it and when it is I don't know right all right go to the next one now let's read and in the middle of this week now here's the 70 now this exactly with seven years each one of the weeks and we've already had 69 weeks not 69 and a half right we've already had 69 weeks then we have the Gentile age he said 69 weeks Gentile age then there's one more week left for the Jew right amen all right right I hope you're seeing this it's a beautiful picture if you can see it right amen is that right and that's exactly how long not 3 and 1/2 years 7 years right all right if this was 7 years that's 7 years cuz he said there's 70 weeks determined upon thy people so we know we got seven years for the Jews is that true now look at it if there's a question I want to know it and we'll probably get a bunch after lunch right now in the middle of the week in the middle of this Jewish exactly week everybody read that amen he didn't say Messiah week he didn't say the ministry of Jesus Christ right he said in the middle of this Jewish week amen that's three and A2 years the Antichrist the prince a prince that is to come and remember he comes out of Rome the prince that is to come what is he a pope a prince among the people that's true they up a pharaoh who doesn't know Joseph now what is he talking about he's talking about after the two prophets prophesy 1260 days right amen which is 3 and 1/2 years by the prophetic cant at the end of that the Antichrist breaks that Covenant right says no more Temple worship you can't do this you can't do that I'm taking over that's right the man of sin right the man of sin right all right so that's what he's saying but where is it in the middle of this Jewish weat right in there all right next what's these two prophets going to do when they come this Beast this Prince that shall scatter the power of the Holy people what will he do he'll break his Covenant with them after see they've got it highlighted right here we're talking about this last week all right right he'll break his Covenant with them after 3 and one2 years right he'll out them now people thinks that's communism that's just cuz you have the spirit of God hasn't dealt with you yet it's not communism it's religion religious demons it's not going to be uh Americans against notes and no it's going to be Protestants and Catholics now these two prophets what will they do it's Moses and Elijah they'll rise on the scene they'll tell those Jews they're mistak and out of that Jewish Bunch that's there now to be the 144,000 God will call these two prophets what is it Spirit of Elijah off this G church will just continue right on into the Jewish church amen huh yeah Boaz and Ruth had a baby yeah who did they give it to amen which is the type of the old church the Jew all right and out of that Jewish Bunch there'll be 144,000 same thing same thing with Rachel amen out of Rachel out of the Bride that he really wanted Joseph is the type of who Christ amen Joseph was not one of the tribes right not the original he was put in remember after Dan and Ephraim did what they did Joseph was put in so he's not an original tribe he's the type of Christ that's right Christ and who she have Benjamin type of what 144,000 we send Christ to the 144,000 out of us we birth Christ to the4 4,000 you understand that it's a beautiful picture we won't have time to do it but but go back and read Jacob and Rachel and Le just let God deal with you and buty you'll see this down 70 weeks open it's perfect cuz it's Redemption folks it's not all dates and times and season but you got to get your days right or you going to have a gap right here like a lot of people do they got a gap right here all right and he'll preach that they he'll preach the same message of Pentecost to those Jews that they rejected the Messiah man you see it it'll be the same Pentecostal message that these Jews will preach right over to them and they'll hate those Jews so bad till they'll kill them and they were hated by all nations in the midst of the week right oh yeah exactly right there midst of the week right in there remember there's lifeover time it's not that battle of Armageddon it's just like the church it's like the U um virtu it's not faith in a straight line and virtue in another straight line knowledge in a straight line all that those l lines are for reference amen you get Faith all through there you get knowledge all through there you get Temperance all through there you get patience all through the statute of perfect man it's not just you get one lay it on the Shelf you get another lay on shelf no you just keep growing in Grace and knowledge same thing with this that line is just a reference line because that's the middle of the last week right all right and they were hated by all nations in the midst of the week because that they had raised up a great power for 144,000 they had the Holy Ghost and brother you talking about doing Miracles see that's when the six seal open yes cuz the six seal Breaks by those two prophets amen right so six seals brings us Redemption here and brother R said the seventh brings him back to earth right yeah seven seal the end of all things and we get the we get the spiritual Revelation so that ends for us the Gentiles but he's got to go to the Jews and get them yes by a six-fold purpose the seals are going to open naturally to them they're going to get a sixfold purpose which finishes their Redemption amen and the city that's right and brings Christ back to Earth in Revelations 19 not by himself with us amen cuz he's not going to be seen without us anymore after we go with him right and they were hated by All Nations they had the Holy Ghost and brother you talking about doing Miracles they did they stopped heavens and didn't rain in the days of their prophecy smoke the Earth with plagues L as they wanted to they gave plages and everything else they'll give them Romans a hard way to go amen praise the Lord finally right but finally they'll be killed right what after they prophesy for three and a half years correct all right that's where we seen her coming back to the Millennium wellit I'm sorry I missed one but finally they'll be killed our God is a terrible God when he's angry but remember that's over in the 70th week not half week right right the church is going glory amen and amen the wedding supper is going on for us amen all right now notice that's where we seen her coming back to the Millennium Temple over here at the end I'm going to prove it just a minute of the Jewish age Glory he didn't say Messi we he's talking about the natural Jews right right or the 144,000 to be correct the anointed here he comes riding on a white horse now when is that Revelations 19 right right the those followed him on white horses who are you and I dressed in white blood are V in blood ruing him the word of God he cometh the mighty conqueror to set up the Millennium coming to the temple amen amen that Temple God's not going to come to you and dwell in an unclean vessel right so he's not going to go to that Temple unless it's built right the right way according to Ezekiel 40-44 right and I just believe 144,000 is going to come back here and build it right we're not going to build it we're here on a honeymoon you you take your wife on a honeymoon build make her build a house you went there as a feast as a wedding as a as a happy time for you and your and your new and your new spouse we're not going to go back and and do that stuff they're going to build it we'll prove it in a second Glory there he meets that see coming to the temple there he meets that 144,000 they're already here right revelation 19 we come cuz remember the Millennium is to the Jews not to us but somebody's got to live a th years to do away with a sin curs now you and I are glorified bodies right we're in eternity we can't live A Thousand Years we're already Eternal right so somebody's got to live that Thousand Years somebody's got to prove that sin curse is over so it really doesn't matter when we come riding back in we're going right to that Temple amen after the 144,000 building we're going right to it right all right everybody understand that kind of sort of amen if some of you moved I think your faceing crack we ought to be happy about this people my we ought to be rejoicing whether I'm wrong or not you ought to be rejoicing if you're right you ought to be rejoicing amen amen exactly it's I get a little bit from him you know blame him I got his get at right all right let's go to the next one and I really appreciate them matter of fact now listen to this just this is just a point because remember I heard the man clothed in linen Daniel 12: 7-9 which was upon the Water of the river and when he held up his right hand and his left hand under heaven and swear by him that liveth forever you ever heard that before yes sir Revelations 10 right right but now remember the guy in Revelations 10 is time shall be no longer right that's to me and you right because we don't have times exactly but right here it shows for a Time times and a dividing of time three and a half years amen right everybody understand that is that okay and then he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the Holy people after that remember after that he's going to do what he's going to break that Covenant and Scatter the people try to anyway all right all these things shall be finished and I heard but I understood not then said I oh my Lord what shall be the end of these things and let me emphasize this go thy Way Daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end there's no way I don't care who in the world preached Daniel 70 weeks before the prophet broke it they were wrong right that's right it was sealed according to the Bible Glory until the time of I say until the time brother Gerald of this end this end right the time of this end it's when these things were supposed to be made known now Revelations 11:3 let's make sure we get over into here and I will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy th23 score days closing saclo now we know that that's 3 and 1/2 years of a messiah Ministry that two prophets are going to preach because remember look holy right there what did he have right there right we know he was the Messiah but he had the sign of the Messiah Glory right right he was the Messiah but he had the sign of Messiah right right the two witnesses are going to have what sign of the Messiah Glory signs and wonders William Brandon let me bring it right to me and you this is where we're going to get our seven Rachel right right here that last three and 1/2 year Ministry of brother brandom was his real message Glory that's right the rest was a restoration amen back to the faith of the fathers amen what was preached by Paul and Peter James and John right amen you say well it's 1963 that was only and he he was killed in December that's only 2 and 1/2 years let let me read you something I got time brother Claude wer brought this to my attention and he's a real good brother of mine very good friend I want you to listen now in when did brother R preached the S 63 March of 63 right March of 63 this may not mean one thing to you but it helps me all right it's not on there I'm going to read it off here so it's not on there they don't have it I know if I get to okay listen on communion if you want to write this down 19622 04 on the message communion right February 196 62 right brother BR priest in Jeffersonville we see that the astronomers are predicting sometime in this early part of the first part of the month beginning on the 2D or the 5th or somewhere along this month the Indian astronomers predict the worlds to blow to pieces and the American newspapers make fun of it I do not believe the world's going to blow into pieces but I do say it's wrong to make fun of it right because something's fixing to happen one of these days something similar to do that right when the five planets Mars Jupiter and Venus and so forth come into their there they never have did it oh they say 25,000 years ago it happened but who was back there to know it yeah that's a haha okay brother R said that who was there who was back there to know it but listen that was paragraph 74 paragraph 75 I pred I predict that this has a spiritual application Glory I believe it's the coming in of the issue of God right that the great revelation of the word will be open during this time right this is 1962 February the great revelation of the word will be open during this time remember they claim it was three stars came in or when Jesus was born this is five five is the grave three is the number of perfection five is the number of Grace and so forth number of Grace if God ever sends his power of the church it's by his grace right God sends anything to us it'll be his grace not our Merit so so it may mean something I predict that there'll be a change I don't know what it'll be now this is 1962 we're right on the eve of it now Glory all right next message he preached was the end time seed sign 1962 319 just a 19 a month and a half later all right now what happened we see a roar in the paper across the television out across the Nations where five stars just fell in line with the world what's five the number of Grace every time those stars come then something happens on Earth what's taking place five stars fell in what was it an introducing of what right beginning of Sorrows earthquakes picked up everywhere what's happened an infant church amen hallelujah Glory a bride right infancy that the power of God has beg to fall yes sir on her right right that's right there your three and 1 half years right cuz he's Pro he's telling us she's taking form of Bride for this bridegroom right it's the Church of the Living God coming together under the word of God and the Astron astronomic Heaven is announcing her approach amen uhhuh glory might not believe that but it's the word just the same yes sir that was that was paragraph 78 so if you don't believe something happened listen to you Prophet that was in March of 62 March of 63 preached the Cs two 2 years and 8 months later he died he buil God's got a lap over people right he's got a lap over that's right his message did start in the seals but there was platforms that he built foken word's Original Seed all these things statue of a perfect man what's he doing he was getting ready and then when that thing came out he said my gosh a baby Church's bar that's right out of that constellation shown in the heavens You and I by the word that he preached not saying that the word was was any less relevant before then not at all because that's your background that's your platform that's what you stand on to understand these other things all right it's time we start eating some meat quit drinking so much milk I like milk when but when I go to a state place I don't order just milk right I order a state I might have some milk but if it's a state there I'm Le Stak all right so you're going to give power to two prophets and they should prophesy a,3 2003 score days cloth and sackcloth so that's what they get right they get that three and a half year Ministry of Jesus Christ correct Messiah the sign of the Messiah the sign of the Messiah here I'm going to walk over and do this anyway the sign of the Messiah here the sign of the Messiah here brings Rachel together the sign of the Messiah the sign of the Messiah brings Leah together amen okay that's just my thought all right I'm reading between the lines today okay it's not your it's not if that love letter is not to you then you either got another lover you just ain't fell in love with mine yet so I don't know all right let's keep going Revelations 11: 9-12 and they of the people in Kindred and tongue and Nation shall see their dead bodies three days and a half kind of funny that they lay in the street for three and A2 days right it's not funny at all it means something but we can't get into that and shall not suffer their dead bodies be put in and they that dwell on the Earth shall rejoice am man they going to send each other gifts they going to send Bowl tickets and all kind of stuff to people uhhuh they going to send gifts to one another because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth and after 3 days and a half there's that word after again is it one day after two days after 10 years after it's after I say it's just going to be after the 3 and 1/2 days the spirit of life from God entered into them they stood on their feet and great fear fell upon them which saw them right seeing in Fox News uhhuh that's the only time that can be made known nobody else can see that except in the end time exactly right see them yes see them all right and they heard a great voice from Heaven saying unto them didn't that happen in Revelations 4:1 didn't he say come up here uh that's right well he's telling them the same thing Glory so what puts us in a Rapture is going to put them in the Rapture all right and they heard a great voice from Heaven saying unto them come up hither and they ascended up to heaven in a cloud and their enemies beheld them and that was right there because what's going to happen after that I have quotes here the battle of Armageddon begins immediately after that right that's what it happens all right and the battle of Armageddon is not going to be a one- day battle that's right it's man's fire we walk out on the ashes of the wicked that doesn't happen in the future home right amen remember the city sits down on a redeemed entire Earth in the future home the Millennium we walk out in the ashes ashes means something burned up you say oh what about radiation you with a glorified body you already took a resurrection you already took a Rapture and you're worried about radiation I don't think so we're going to be brighter than any radiation will ever make amen yes we'll have it from the inside out not from the outside in that's right cuz see the Battle of our begin is going to be where man is going to be standing there alive and the flesh is going to fall off their body the scripture right that's right that's your battle Mar again that's not going to happen go and Magog that's totally different that's God's fire that's where you kill Souls that's right all right this one just kills the battle of Armageddon brother R said man's fire kills man's always destroyed the Earth right so now here's here's a couple of things just this is my quote six seals finishes our Redemption the seventh seal brings Christ back to the Earth to get us right not in the physical form but brother R said he'd be so visible Among Us raise the dead and join the Rapture that's quote right the sixfold purpose finishes 144 his Redemption and brings Christ back to the earth now he doesn't come back right here right right they're not bride that's right right they're not incarnate God like we are come on people they lost their right of being a wife I read you that when he divorc sir they're servants now all right so they're going to get the Holy Ghost and they're going to take a Rapture but they're not bright amen right that's right so where is he going to come back I'll show you in a minute all right let's go notice now exactly the continuity of the scripture exactly the same under the seventh trumpet see everybody's wondering about trumpets well the seventh trumpet is to Israel the same as the seventh seal was to the church amen which is what Revelations 11:15 and the seventh angel sounded and there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world that's what we're going to say when we leave out of here Glory the kingdoms of this world right here yes have become the kingdoms of of our Lord and of his Christ and he shall reign forever and ever and that's exactly what he's going to do with the Jews so the seventh trumpet does what calls Israel back to the atonement not to kill another beast that's right to realize they missed him the first time that's and they'll say where did you get those scars he become so visible among them so they put sackcloth and Ashes they get out of that Temple they say hey them sacrifices are stening my nostrils right God's now dwelling here and they're going to be killed because of that so we can parallel and see that Redemption because the seven trumpet does what the seventh trumpet to the Jews draws them where to the atonement right right what is atonement Redemption right without an atonement you can't be redeemed all right everybody okay with that all right go to 15 theing end time ending of the Gentile dispensation he will prophesy in the 70th week which is three and 1/2 years and in the midst of it he shall be cut off which is 7 years 70 weeks is determined for thy people 7 years approximately to the Jews amen yes to the Jews right going keep going we got to get in a hurry here the Lamb of the Messiah the prince shall come and should be for 70 weeks that's 7 years that's what dad's trying to show you when brother brandom gets out of that Daniel 70 weeks book it's kind of like the Feast of the trumpets it's important but he never preached them again right he preached Daniel 7 weeks never preached them again hey those to the Jews right all right but he makes references to it but what he can't deny though that there's a messiah Weeden absolutely amen there's a messiah weat that's different from that Jewish wheat right that's right sir it's hidden inside there Glory right that's right right there right all right go with me just a second because see we're going to we're going to come outside the book Dad read a few of them see that's where everybody gets all confused brother said no no no n n n only three and a half what you talking about that right there the Messiah we he's in Redemption now Glory he's talking about Redemption that's the only Redemption that whole 7 weeks can be compressed into those that seven years yes sir three and 1/2 here that we get three and a half here that they get that's where you bring that mysterious weat that most people don't realize is there is everybody okay with that amen I don't have a quote for that but I read between the lines here because it's going to make all these quotes that everybody gets so so bump puzzled about it's going to make them come right into view because look for the 70 weeks that's 7 years so brother Randon is there one week left for the Jews no but there's seven quotes in the Daniel 70 weeks book that there's one week left after the Rapture right yeah right yeah amen you can't erase it right it's written can't erase it amen but you going to see where he says no no n n n n he said I didn't say that they asked him they said you said there was 7 years left after the Rapture brother R's mind is not talking about a Jewish week right he's talking about that Messiah week cuz he has he has he has pulled out of the Danel 70 weeks and now he's looking at Redemption cuz he's trying to get a bride ready if he doesn't get a bride ready the Jews don't get ready that's right right we got to get out of here the reason he's not going out there brother Frank to the Jews is cuz you're sitting in that seat and I'm standing up here that's right and and and Bill y Pastor for the record we are in his church oh yes the the prince should come and be for 70 weeks that's seven years he's compressing it all down right he's not doing away with that Jewish week or that last seven years because I'm going to prove to you if you'll just go read the sixfold purpose that's right if you'll read the sixfold purpose amen it'll prove to you there's one week left after the rap just read we're going to read it just a minute all right go to the next one six seal Dad read it we're going to read it again kingom of God in Hand kingom of Heavens to be set up the time last 3 and 1/2 years right there am I okay yeah of Daniel's 70th week promised to the Jews right his people remember now that to prove that that this is Daniel's last part of the s week he's running it all into that one week right there right he's saying the last part right there not over here that's a Jewish week now 70 weeks was promised which was 7 years amen 70 490 years is Promised right uhhuh but for Redemption purposes only seven years are promised right yeah that okay we all right all some of you still are out in la la land somewhere that's okay it took me a little while but when I when I read when dad told me he said write he told me two things he said write Parable on top of every page when you read Daniel 7 weeks right this is their Parable this is their Parable this is their Parable and then he said go read the sixfold purpose and put it in line right so now let's go to the next one he said the Messiah shall come he will prophesy in the 70th week which is 3 and 1/2 years in the midst of it he'll be cut off which is 7 years 70 weeks is determined for thy people people 7even years approximately to the Jews he said to Messiah the prince shall come and prophesy in the midst of the seven weeks 7even days will be cut off now what's he talking about right there right remember that that said that had a twofold meaning and he shall confirm the Covenant with many for a week there is not a scripture in the Bible that says the messiah's going to be cut off in the midst of the week right find it right find it it doesn't say it it says after 62 weeks right Messiah will be cut off right it doesn't say ever find it if you can find it it does not say after 3 and a half years the Messiah will be cut off right it says after 62 weeks right but brother randam is condensing that down to that Messiah week brothers that's your key amen and if you don't get it your people's not going to get it sorry I still get a little mean from him but your people are under you if you you don't get it your people's not going to get it right it's true now when Messiah comes Jesus he preached exactly three and a half Messiah read how many times in these quotes he's going to say Messiah he's never going to say a Jewish week he's going to say messiah messiah messiah now when Messiah come Jesus he preached exactly 3 and 1/2 years and was cut off for a sacrifice but at the end of the Gentiles there would still be 3 and 1/2 Years yet to the Jews amen Messiah week yes Messiah week I hope you getting all right let's go keep going and if that was the sign of the Messiah yesterday it's the same today or he did the wrong sign now this is we would see Jesus this is outside the Daniel 7 weeks book and then Israel was right and justified by killing him denying him to be the Messiah CU he'd be an impostor but they killed him because that he proved that he was Messiah there wasn't a rock to be overturned as we get to further and we now you see he is the Messiah see how many times he say a messiah messiah messiah keep going evening evening messenger notice if the Gentile church has to be taken away first for the Jews then the end of the 70 weeks of Daniel takes place not here here in the middle of the 70th week he's bringing it all down to right here and then there's three and 1/2 weeks left yet and we find out two prophets of Revelations he never changes his code again of Revelation 11 comes down and prophesies to the Jew now the church will be taken away at that time just keep rolling through now here's a little thing we're going to reverse back aand this on the first SE I think Dad read this we the 3 and 1/2 years of Daniel 70 weeks the last half of Daniel 70 weeks which is three and 1/2 years right there right there not this Jewish week right there's one week left to finish the 490 years he ain't completed the 4 he got 483 he's got to complete 483 he's got to change it to 490 so it's got to be 7 years left so when he says 3 and 1/2 then forget about forget about seven he's not talking about seven he's talking about 3 and 1/2 all right just keep going cuz we we're going to get behind now just 70 weeks was deter determined perfectly as Daniel said that Messiah would come and would be cut off in the midst of the week there is no scripture for that he's cut off after 62 weeks yeah all right but brother randam is telling you right what the scripture is saying amen you do my water and Jesus prophesied 3 and 1/2 years now in the middle of this three and 1/2 years of Daniel in the middle of it he was cut off yeah now the last part is the Tribulation period where the Gentile church is oh this is great the bride goes in with the groom then after the Millennium walks out upon the ashes of the wicked keep that in mind keep going these two witnesses prophesy in the time of Daniel second half of the 70 weeks not this one that's where everybody goes bunkers it's the last half of the m week right remember how he takes the Daniel 70 weeks I said we would need him when we get in there I don't know why but something told me we need it amen and here we are can we say here we are amen whether you like it or not here we are now remember Daniel was told that the Messiah would come the prince the Messiah rather and would prophesy Israel still had 70 weeks left and in the midst of the 70 weeks that's right in the midst of the 70 weeks is 35 and A2 uhhuh that don't even calculate so he's talking about that Messiah week in the midst of the 70 week the Messiah look how many times he says Messiah would be cut off and the daily sacrifice taken away but there was still 3 and 1/2 Weeks toer which is right there fifth seal now these Jews I have to do this in order now to see the revelation of this seal in order to see the revelation of this seal right see what it is these Souls Under The Altar and who they are now notice in the time of Daniel now the second half of the 70th week right here not this one this one now remember Messiah was to be cut off in the midst that's the middle that's where he was cut off people he was cut off to get me and you amen right let his blood be on us and our children that's when he was cut off he'd already preached three and 1/2 years so in the midst of that Messiah week he was cut off amen okay everybody all right with that that's the middle what's half of seven three and A2 Prophet going make it simple for you how long did Christ preach the church answers three and A2 that's right now but there's determined yet to the people what another 3 and 1/2 years right there all right keep going all right notice these Messengers now these messengers of Revelations 12 these two prophets they're going to preach the kingdom is at hand that's the first thing Jesus preached right King Of Heaven is the hand y remember now to prove that this is Daniel's last part of the 70th week right here I got a question on that for tomorrow now let's skip through that cuz we're going to have to hurry up I don't want to I know you want to eat probably more than you want to hear me but this is important last part of the 7 week do I need to keep these quotes that's what makes everybody bers they go how this the last half and this and nothing over here that's Daniel 70th 70th part last part of the 70th week brother randam is condensing it down to the Messiah week yeah Redemption I'm talking about Redemption all right so go to the next quot that's one Dad read because he said he said I believe that you mentioned that the full last week or last seven years will begin when the bride was taken in Rapture he did right seven times yeah yeah but we got it wrong right because that person is asking and brother brandom had to be a prophet to pick up what they were asking right amen 7 years of ministry left brother Rand no no no n n n you got that wrong right not the full seven weeks the week started when Jesus came on Earth with his ministry right here and then he'll be cut off and Jesus preached exactly 3 and 1/2 years which is half of the 70 weeks right yes he keep saying 70 weeks right half of the 70 weeks is 35 years so we must be condensing it down to that Messiah week that we're mentioning here which is half of the 70 week seven days weekday now dad's already read that so just keep going go to the next one now here we are the sixfold purpose holds the whole key there right amen you agree when we first started that all six of those purposes happens in the 70 weeks of Daniel right did you not right right cuz that's what the Bible says exactly right 70 weeks determined upon thy people upon thy Holy City to finish transgression number one make an end of sin number two make reconciliation for iniquity listen folks if I had time you can take every bit of that in justification sanctification they have to come same way we do Justified Sanctified the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen when does he reconcile your iniquity when he gives you the Holy Ghost that's right the seals are for our Redemption yeah the six full purposes for their Redemption right the natural opening of the seals to the Jews is to the world that down destruction the man of sin comes and all these things it's not anything to do with the Jews inside sure it drives them but there's two witnesses that's right that's driving them back to Christ right finish transgression end of sin reconciliation for iniquity bringing Everlasting righteous s Vision Prophet anoint Most Holy all right let's go number one a sixfold purpose brother random says now finish the transgression that's number one right you can follow over here he's going to make those blue when we're talking about them all right does everybody see what that is right there that's that 70th week that's the part that we took off of the chart and put over herebody see that okay right amen all right that last mysterious week that people thinks there's just a half of Y you can't have four five and six in 1 2 and three right that happens after the Jews are gone amen come on people it gets good to finish the transgression to finish what to finish Israel's transgression what is transgression is to go against something a transgress against me is to do a wrong to me transgress against you is to do a wrong to you so Israel did a wrong to God and in this 70th week not half week 70th week what's going to happen God is going to finish the transgression of Israel remember we've already seen that we've got the Gentiles redeemed and they're in glory right right all right we're now Redeeming the 144,000 right is that okay we're now redeeming this the sixfold purpose is going to redeem them all right don't forget the city all right don't it says thy people and thy holy city I know two minutes here I told him I said I wish today I was a Yankee so I can talk faster God is going to finish the transgression of Israel all right let's go to number 2 a now listen close let's turn to Matthew 24 now this is where Israel made her fatal mistake keep scrolling cuz I'm going to read all that but there's some good nuggets in that that's where theyve done it he was making an end of their SIN number two see number two being lit up over there is that all right amen that's what the two prophets are going to preach to them right right Redemption that's right right exactly he know they were blind forgive them Father for they don't know what they're doing let his blood be on us they were calling for his blood put an end to sin what sin unbelief they did not believe that that was the Messiah right they could not see him to be Messiah yet done every sign the Messiah was supposed to do but they couldn't see it all right keep going 3A is number three in this in this 70th year of Daniel 70th week rather coming to make an end of sin put it away you understand now watch the first finish transgression make an end of sin number three to make reconciliation for iniquity you who's writing it down to make reconciliation for iniquity iniquity is doing wrong as they did at the cross he made reconciliation but it will not be applied to them it was not applied to them why cuz they were blinded and could not see and why were they blind well we know why they were blind because God blinded them but you're blind because you're willfully blind yeah there's no reconciliation for you he makes that pretty blood don't he if you believe not I am he Jesus said you'll die in your sins all right now as soon as Z saw that that was their Messiah she was born again in one day right make reconciliation for sins and to make reconciliation right there right exactly we okay uncleanness oh my they did what was evil which was wrong reconciliation was made for their iniquity now go here's number four number four cannot happen anywhere in there no that right are we looking are we really looking cuz you don't bring in Everlasting righteousness and then have a battle of arm again right that's right M all right this is what I'm telling you this proves there's one week left for the Jews Jewish week and the city cuz we got to rebuild a temple here pretty quick number four to Bringing Everlasting righteousness that's the fource thing come forth for he is to come to bring an everlasting righteous now look when Israel's trans transgression has come to an end Satan who is their accuser and our accuser Satan will be sealed up in the bottomless pit right when is that oh no it's not it's over here cuz there's nothing over here there's nothing supposed to be over here there's nothing over here my Pointer's dead there's nothing over here but yeah I guess there is something there Satan will be sealed up in the bottomless pit When what when bringing in Everlasting righteousness something that cannot end Glory all because unrighteousness will be done away with keep going all right oh my in other words when the enemy has been put away the end of sin has come the bringing in of everlasting righteousness has come Satan is sealed up in the bottomless pit and the knowledge of the Lord shall fill the Earth as a water cover the sea amen glory to God it's coming brother it's coming women will be women men will be men all right now the Millen Millennium is on right amen 5 minutes I'll be done all right five minutes I'll be done because remember what do we say we haven't said a word about the city till now cuz it says thy people and thy holy city right that City's got to be redeemed just like you and I that's right all right when the city look all right now Millennium then is on that's when the Millennium when the city is to be built fourth I had about six more scriptures let's keep going number five to seal up the vision and prophecy what's he talking about he talking about sealing up in the people what in the end time us a revelation we're going to carry a revelation with us people that's right all right let's keep going come on now you watch when we get into D in 7 weeks how that comes out that's when the Myster is going to be revealed that's when he breaks his Covenant in the middle of the week he's talking about times and half times all right now have we got time for this last one thank you now six anoint the most holy oh my here's the one the last thing he was to do was what now just go back over Daniel find out what he's doing now if you'll read that it'll put you right there right okay that's the sixfold reason of his coming now what to anoint the most holy now this may be a little bit strange for just a minute to many of you teachers but just hold it just a minute now let's see how it comes out this is the anointing not of a man right Jesus is already anointed is that right the book of Acts said that God anointed Jesus with the Holy Ghost and went around doing good he is the messiah messiah means the anointed one is that right but here at the end time he's the anoint to anoint the most holy what is the most holy to my way of seeing it which I believe I can prove it by the scripture is to anoint the most holy which will be the Tabernacle that will be used during the Millennium right hey amen amen the six F purpose that six laps right over into that Millennium exactly Christ comes right down with us right and buddy we're having a good time amen amen there is the 70 weeks of that right we got another one that's all oh go go to the last one cuz you see the description of the temple Ezekiel 40:44 keep going all the way to the end so what have we done cuz you going to keep reading the anointing actually the anointing to the temples me and you amen when we come back in Revelations 19 this right here let's read this let me read this right here a confederation of church WIll consolidate them together and bring the Jews into this confederation and bring them back to their own Temple worship again and the thus sayth the Lord out of the Bible they will have their own church what they are now I just caught it fresh they are now a nation recognized is that right but they have not their Temple worship yet and when they establish the temple worship he's talking about down here amen the church will be gone God will be dealing with the Jews as a nation and then when they are brought into this confederation Rome will break it in the middle of the 70th year right that's right right there exactly all right because look desolation spread to the consummation what's the consummation really po people the battle of Armageddon is not going to be a one-day battle it's going to carry over into maybe a year who knows but we're going to walk out on the ashes of all this stuff it's not going to consume everything that's right it's not God's consuming fire it's man's fire atomic fire I can prove that by the prophet's message but we don't have time but now at the very end this is what we've done we took the three people that needed redemption or the three things that needed Redemption and now pull it up we have the Gentiles 144,000 and the city restored yes sir the end of 70 weeks Glory thank you sir amen that's it let's see one question before we go any of you Brothers have a need for any of this to be displayed after when we come back for discussion reason being these brothers are not ministering so according to how we've set up our rules they can't be in here during the discussion so they're going to take all this equipment and put it out in the van and wait on us to get finished with our discussion it won't be taped anymore it won't be videoed anymore we'll go back to what we were doing in the past where we just have a discussion we're going to fight in the backyard our among ourself but don't fight my brother in the front yard right no I hope it it's not going to be just kidding but that's that's what I'm saying about the two brothers the three brothers are not ministers so if you want any of this left up here you're going to have to say so now cuz if not every bit of that's going to be gone now you've got these papers and you've got charts and I've got a chart of the PowerPoint if you want to keep it and look at it when we're finished for your discussion but other than that when we come back from eating they're not going to be in here so that's why he was asking that question speak up now or forever hold your peace okay brother okay sorry I was kind of worried because they going to close the rest here in a minute been waiting on us for a long time we got a lot of good food out there and we sure don't want to throw it away right so I trust you all will enjoy the things that we have tried to prepare for you it's kind of like a buffet very don't like it all just mix it all together and make had a good time so far sir don't do like some have done in the past they thought when we got to hear the meeting was over and they left and went home so it just really begins when we get back everybody gets involved right so uh let's pray for the food now and thank God for all things we've had some great T-bone steaks already we're going to the Natural now amen Lord Jesus we so kindly appreciate the labor Lord yes Lord we want to always remember that the labor that was put in to just place this before us today yes Lord we love and honor you and we appreciate our Brethren yes now God we're going to dismiss from this Sanctuary for a few minutes to go eat some natural food we've been fed up to our ears spiritually God yes Lord we ought to have spiritual heartburns all the way throughout the day yes but we want to go to the Natural Food now and we sure want your blessings to be upon it sanctify it to our bodies and cleanse it by your blood we praise you for it in Jesus name amen amen amen just go through the sanctuary door turn right go out the back door straight over into the fellowship Paul and his sisters I hope they don't not
