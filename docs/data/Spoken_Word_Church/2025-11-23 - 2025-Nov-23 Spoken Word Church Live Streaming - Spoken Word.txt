========================================

the earth where we've been taken from. Father, we want to ask that you will be with us, Father, as we prepare for service, Lord. Thank you for the message that's gone forward. Thank you for the Sunday school teaching, Father, that will go before. Uh I pray that you will prepare us for worshiping, for praying, for service, Father, and for the preaching of your precious word. That you inspire the minister, Father. That you would just put, Father, that anointing, Father, to all the the words and give it life to us. And I pray uh that you would prepare the way for a good time today of fellowship in your word in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Today I'm going be speaking on rest. &gt;&gt; So many rest to our souls, right? And it's a it's a very settling thing to have this age, to have it from the inside out, and to have a rest about where we came from, the destination, where we're going. You know, we we do live in a world that is is raging all the more, sometimes our own body, sometimes our own circumstances, and just everything. And it seems like the more um time goes on, the more that we see the struggle, the um the more I've been able to mature, the more I'm realizing that there's just really a lot to contend with, right? But one thing's for sure, right, is when that soul is at rest, we have that that precious anchor. So have you resting in God in a restless world in God's word, right? So for in Exodus uh 33 we know God uh spoke to Moses and that's when he promised that his presence will be there with him and he said my presence shall go with thee and I will give thee rest. So it's a rest that is given. It's a rest that it's you enter into. It's a rest that we um you know in Spanish they use the word repose. So it's a look looking at the differences between those two words. Repose is is just it's a deeper meaning to it. Whereas rest it could it could also be literal right like sleeping like uh like you know sitting down being still but this rest is is a in Spanish for the most of the times it doesn't use like the word rest it actually uses the word repose which is such a rich word to mean like it kind of adds more than just being you know still it puts all those together. So I'm thankful that there remains to rest right. So we know in Hebrews 4:9 kind of goes back and forth because there's even a promise that that God swore that they would not enter into the rest. But we'll read to whom it's talking about and under what condition. But you know sometimes we take those words and and we bring bring content to it that of course there remainth the rest are for though right to the people of God right and uh it's a blessing to know here I was reading on Ruth how God rested we know when he created and he loves resting he's commanded rest in the the one day and seven he's commanded rest one year and seven he's commanded rest after the seven times seven I mean seven uh times that you have the seven year and then you have the jubilee, right? But one of the things is for certain is is God will not rest until he does certain things. And I know he's typified here. So then in Ruth we have then said she sit still as Naomi my daughter until thou know it says until thou daughter it says until thou know how the matter will fall for the man will not be in rest until he have finished the thing this day. What a confidence, right? To know that that um the only way the Lord's going to rest is when he accomplished what what he wants to do. And then he does rest and then he gives his rest. Here it is in Isaiah 62 coming forth. It says uh first verse, for Zion's sake, I will not hold my peace. And for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest until the righteous thereof go forth as brightness and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burnth. So God God loves rest. He constituted rest. He's the one that um was the one that created it all and he was his own inspector, right? He saw that and he said that it was good and and and that's why he rested because things were as they ought to be, right? And I think that um he grants that to the believer, right? As we'll learn here a little bit, we'll go through the we'll learn a little bit about unrest, right? And one of the things that it takes to be able to when you do enter into his rest, just what a contrast it is and what a difference it is and what a stillness it is, particularly when we're speaking about the soul. So here we have um in first kings 8:56 it says blessed be the Lord that hath given us given rest unto his people Israel according to all that he promised. He had not failed one word of all his good promise which he promised by the hand of Moses. Amen. His servant. We're so thankful we have that type in this age, right? where we have a message uh that's a promise and that and that a lot of people see it as a something to u of confusion but but it is a rest it is a rest brothers and I'll just touch here about nine verses nine nine scripture verses I have here about what it is to be at unrest right because it it in order for you to be at rest to even know what it was is you had to go through the unrest in our life right so what I have here is in Jeremiah 6:16 thus Say the Lord, stand ye in the ways, and see and ask for the old paths. Where is the good way and walk therein? And you shall find rest for your souls. But they said, we will not walk therein. &gt;&gt; Man, we've all had our times. Look what Job said here. My bones are pierced in me in the night season and my sinu take no rest. Look at Job 30:27. I've been here. He says, "My bowels boiled and rested not. The days of affliction prevented me." We know what unrest is, right? in sleeping or in rest in in just your emotions or in rest in um in your eternal destination. How is that soul going to be resting when there's when there's no assurance? Right? Whether people know it or not. Psalms 38:3 it says, "There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger. Neither is there any rest any in my bones because of my sin." You know, interesting enough, I was meditating on this and I had to gas up yesterday and I went and I went to the gas station and then there was this song bad to my bones or something like that and I was just bad and I'm like trying to get away from I'm like I'm just the the machine was broken so I had to get down there and pay and it just said bad to the bones and I just read the scripture and I'm like Lord let me be good to the bones you [laughter] know it's just like there's no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger neither is there any rest in my bones. I mean, look at that. Even your bones need rest or the anointing rests, right? We know because of my sins. So, unbelief. But the wicked are like the troubled sea. I just put a little image of that. When it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt. So, no good, right? And I threw in this proverb over here because I thought it was pretty fitting. If a wise man contended, so even if you try to contend right, with the foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, there's just no rest. Isn't that something? Makes you wonder why sometimes when you're speaking to certain persons, you you just cannot get to that rest. Help us, Lord. Right? It's a condition. And Hebrews it says, "And to whom swear he that they should not enter into his rest, comma, but to them that believeth not." You see, sometimes we just say, "Oh, he said he won't enter into his rest." Of course, there is no rest in unbelief. There's no rest in in um in us not coming but God's provided way right of atonement and of a provided way for for all for being justified for being then there's another rest that comes when we're sanctified and then there's another rest that comes when you're baptized with the Holy Ghost and fire in the soul right and then I believe we're promised and we already are believing onto receiving the glorification right of our body because we already received the first fruits in our in our soul. Amen. And and here we have in Hebrews 4:101, there's a lot just a few verses next. For he that is entered, see you have to enter in into his rest, he also hath seized from his own works, the person as God did from his. 11. Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief. There's clearly a a correlation where unbelief, unrest. Belief rest. And the soul has two senses. Faith or sin, doubt, unbelief. There's either rest or no rest in the soul. But to have rest from sin, brothers, that's what the scriptures are talking about. That's that's to have rest from unbelief. You know what it's like to to have a rest that you just don't have to sin. You don't have to unbelief. You don't have to disbelieve this message, his Bible, his word to us. That's a rest. Isaiah 14:3. And it shall come to pass in the day that the Lord shall give thee rest from thy sorrow and from thy fear and from the hard bondage wherewin wherein thou was made to serve. That's the condition that we're having rest from. In Isaiah Psalms 94, it says that thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity until the pit be digged for the wicked. And then so this is how we long I believe that when you're going through the process of going from unrest to to rest. I remember these these scriptures these verses when you're saying when it says in Psalm 55:6 and I said oh that I had wings like a dove for then I will I would would I fly and be at rest &gt;&gt; just escaping it all right sometimes in this world of unbelief and God given us that message this time God's given us that assurance that the scriptures are laying in the Bible applied died that are made alive in the believer. It it produces that rest that rest of knowing that that we have rapturing faith that we we are going through what the Bible promised. Jeremiah 30:10. Therefore, fear thou not, oh my servant Jacob, saith the Lord, neither be dismayed, oh Israel, for lo I, personal pronouns, will save thee from afar, and thy seed, a promise for the future, too, from the land of their captivity. And Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid. Amen. I look at this photo here. There's this lighthouse and there's this water. It's a famous photograph and there's this big waves and there's you can barely see that there's a person right there is standing. That's kind of what it looks like when you're transitioning from unrest or starting to to be in the lighthouse, right? Starting to be settled on the rock. 2 Thessalonians chapter 1:7 says, "And thou and to you who are troubled, rest with us when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels preparation." Amen. So we have this is this is my favorite one. This one just came alive when I read it for the first time that I can remember reading it. And Psalm 116:7 says, this is a prayer or a song. Return unto thy rest, oh my soul. It's like you're singing to your own soul, right? For the [clears throat] Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee. Now, we know we go through hardship, but it's talking about the soul. It's talking about that rest. The Lord has given us that rest in the soul when when there's that faith. Amen. Psalm 37:7 says, "Rest in the Lord and wait patiently for him. Fred not thyself because of him who prosperth in his way because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. Rest in the Lord." Is 32:17. And the work of righteousness shall be peace. But look at the effect. And the effect of righteousness, quietness and assurance forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation and in sure dwellings and in quiet resting places. That's a good description here of of the believer's rest. I said 321 171 18 just full of rich words like that's going to be the effect of righteousness. You're going to have quietness, assurance forever and you're going to have uh his people he said have a peaceable habitation and in sure dwellings and in quiet resting places man from all the noise of the world and all the unbelief. I I just remember what it's like to enter into that rest. And it is a settleness of the things that are of of divine value, right? Of of eternal value. And I'll go fast here because we got some really good uh more message quotes and scriptures to share. Psalm 139 1-3, it says, "Oh Lord, thou has searched me and known me. Thou knowest, so he knows your rest. Thou knowest my sitting down and my uprising. Thou understandeth my thoughts far far off. Thou compasseth that's just a way another way of saying he understand my path and my lying. And that word lying there I know I read it in other verses in in Spanish in particular version of King James. And that lying down it it just means repose. It's rest. So it's beautiful to says that he knows your rest. He's acquainted. He knows when you go out and sit and rest with them and and and stay still with him and are acquainted with all of my ways. Just think it's beautiful that he he cares for for the rest. So let's talk a little bit about the Lord's rest. He himself rests as well and and he talks about his own rest and how he rests. So we know in Genesis and God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that in in it he had rested. He's the first one that you know instituted rest from all his works which God created and made in Isaiah 11 and10. And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse which shall stand for an end sign of the people to it shall the Gentiles seek. Isn't that beautiful that we're prophesied even in the Old Testament that the Gentiles It's interesting sometimes the the Jews, right? Uh there there's even uh we're promised in their own Bible to to be manifested. It says to it shall the Gentiles seek and his rest shall be glorious. Says a glorious rest even for the Gentiles is promised here. We know for the for the church for Zion. And it says Matthew 8:20. And Jesus said unto him, "The foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the son of man hath not where to lay his head." So interesting, right? There was a rest in the natural and the ark, in the covenant, and a place for him to dwell in, for his presence to dwell in. And of course, we know that in the spiritual, right, he wants to dwell in a certain place. So we we talk about his rest in in there. And it says in Acts 7:49, "Heaven is my throne and earth is my foottool. So what house will you build me? Say the Lord." Or what is the place of my rest? Right? Challenging there. Uh and look at this. Psalm 132 for I think he answers it. For the Lord has chosen Zion. &gt;&gt; He had desired it for his habitation. This is my rest forever. Very Bible good Bible answer here in Zion. Forever he wants to rest there. I will dwell. And usually where you dwell is where you rest for I have desired it. I will abundantly bless her provision. I will satisfy her poor with bread with God's own word. Right? And I just want to highlight that verse again. It's in the middle of the two I I read. This is my rest forever. Here I will dwell for I have desired it. Talking about sign. So that is his resting place. Psalm 1328 it says arise O Lord into thy rest. Look at that. This is beautiful. It's like the psalmist or it's a song or a poem or something being out. It says arise O Lord into thy rest. So it's actually commanding the Lord to rest. It says, "Thou the ark of thy strength." Isn't that beautiful? This is actually somebody else speaking these words on behalf of the Lord. It says, "Go ahead and arrest, Lord, you and in the ark of thy strength." And then we have here where um where it says, I want to just quickly read this because I thought of I found something really interesting um about Solomon. So, we know David and then Solomon ended up building the his temple. Behold, a son shall be born to thee. He's talking to David. Who shall be a man of rest. I actually learned that Solomon is shalom or shalom. It comes from the word rest. Shalom. And it says, "And I will give him rest from all his enemies roundabout. For his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quiet unto Israel in his own days." So the very own name Solomon is being described here. He shall build an house for my name, and he shall be my son, and I will be his father. And I will establish the throne for his kingdom over Israel forever. Now my son, the Lord be with thee, and prosper thou, and build the house of the Lord thy God, and he as as he hath said of thee. Just beautiful to know that, you know, there's a house being built today and there's a son and that there's a man of rest and that we know there's a greater than Solomon here, &gt;&gt; man. Luke 767 says, "And the scribes and the Pharisees watched whether watched him whether he would heal on the Sabbath day that they might find an accusation against him." And I put these two scriptures together here because I just want to say I'm thankful that the Lord will heal me on a Saturday that will heal me on a Sabbath that will bring us the healing and he was not ashamed to be the Lord of the of the Sabbath. And I just think it's beautiful here because it says here in Matthew 12:8, for the son of man is Lord even of the Sabbath day. &gt;&gt; Son of man said so rescue of the soul. I'm going to wrap up here. Matthew 11:29, "Take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and lonely in load in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls." Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not just the rest, but it's the soul rest. In Psalm 62, favorite of mine, it says, "My soul wait." And that word wait, it actually means rest as well. It says, "My soul wait thou only upon God for my expectation is from him. He only is my rock and my salvation. He is my defense. I shall not be moved." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll speak just briefly about Jubilee because um there's also a rest um that it was promised and it says in Leviticus 25:10, "And ye shall haul the 50th year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land into the inhabitants thereof. It shall be a jubilee unto you, and you shall return every man unto his possession." You to return to your land. You should return every man to his own family, unto his family. And I think that's where we rest is because the Lord's calling us home. &gt;&gt; He's calling us into his jubilee. I think the believer entered into to me it was real special that the first service I came here was literally on the celebration of the 50th appearance of the cloud to me. I heard this message as a here's your jubilee. Here's your shout and the mark of the beast. We know brother Benham here in the message it says and it says here now get back to our type. Now there was a beautiful type given and I wish to start with today the marking of the beast. Uh it says now in the old testament the bible said that there was to be a 50th jubilee that was seven times seven years and in the 40th night year that it was to be made ready and the 50th year was the jubilee year. 50th means jubilee. It was 50 is God's jubilee number. The word pentecost means 50. It was the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and the end of the 50th day. I was also it was also at the end of the 50th year. Amen. Just typifying there what it's going to be. Isaiah 61. The spirit of the Lord God is upon me. And here's the same thing to proclaim liberty to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord. So when the Lord comes by your way, he's giving you that jubilee. And the believer's rest in it says here in this hour it is precept upon my precept, line upon line, hear a little, there a little, hold fast to that which is good. For with the stammering lips and other tongues will I speak to this people and this is the refreshing. Amen. This is the rest that shall come from the presence of the Lord. Remember he told Moses, "Go, my presence will be with you and I will give you rest." And then here we have um speaking about rest and how it says at the bottom. Oh, what is he? The one that comes in you gives you peace, your sign, your comforter at your in your rest. And here I love because it says the bottom it says when we enter into God, we rest all the time. Not from Sunday, not from one Sunday to another. We rest eternal. We got eternal life. The Holy Spirit gives you rest. Amen. And here's talking about stones. On the top it talks about stones that were offense and of laughing and of stumbling and of uh but here we talk about it says but for the church a precious load stone to the believer a stone of assurance a stone of rest oh mine resting I know that I have passed from death unto life my soul is at rest oh come unto me all that labor and heavy laden and I will give you rest see it was a sign to be evil spoken of talking about how prophet uh spoke to uh Mary Simeon And he spoke to Mary and saying that the same stone was going to be what is it spoke about before Christ the stumbling stone to the world and it was going to be uh speaking against but to us he's a stone of rest and then here it says but it will be an assurance it will be a love it will be a satisfaction and it will be something that you know you've passed from death unto life this is that scripture of Simeon and 5:24 verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life, and shall not come unto condemnation, but is is pass from death unto life. Amen. Rest in Jesus. Rest from all works. Amen. God bless you, brothers. [applause]
