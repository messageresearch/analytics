holy holy I want to see amen everybody say praise the lord it's a good way to start 2012 is it right amen you know some quotes that isin't it wonderful that you can pick up a message that was spok spoken by our Prophet 40 years ago or 50 years ago and it it's not time stamped it's not time dat right am I got one here for you this morning and and I wanted to begin with this just had it come on strong on my heart this morning brother brandom asked a question he says this is out of a message called my new ministry he says did you know that God knew that we'd be standing here 10 million years before the world was ever amen did you know that God knew that we' be standing you know you might think well I just made a wrong turn and ended up at the wrong church this morning but did you know that God knew that 10 million years before the world was ever formed you know how he like to talk about this did you know he knew we'd be standing here this morning the infin infiny of God knowed every fly every NAD every time they had bat their eyes and how much Tallow they would produce before the world was ever he says now you'll say well if he knows it then why are you preaching that's a good question is God knows the end what what's what's all the in between stuff going on then why are you preaching he says that's part of God's program y preaching is his program right amen you know I like one quote I didn't bring it along because I you know I don't know I run into a lot of tape people that believe you just got to just get it off the tape but there's one place brother BR says God does not use mechanic IAL devices to deliver his word preaching is part of his program when he looked upon the apostles he looked on the Harvest he said the Harvest is right the laborers are few pray the Lord of the Harvest as he'll send laborers into his Harvest how many remember that amen well why would they have to pray to the Lord of harvest to send laborers into his Harvest if the Lord of harvest was standing there knowing it would be done if he know it was going to end up this way brother Randon is asking the question why he says why he says God has so arranged it and he says now listen to this God has so arranged it that his program cannot move without you and I and as long as we're not doing what God leads us to do we're paralyzing his program but when the church moves by the anointing of the Holy Ghost then we're in God's will right doing his program how many want to do his program yes sir all right our text this morning will come out of John chap 4 if you'll turn there this morning morning while you're still standing in John the 4th chapter and we'll begin in verse 30 then they went out of the city and came unto him in the meanwhile his disciples prayed him saying Master eat man I you know you don't have to remember me as a guy who like to preach about hunger and food yeah right in the meanwhile his disciples prayed him saying Master eat but he said unto them I have meat to eat that you know not of therefore said the disciples one to another hath any man brought him ought to eat Jesus saith unto them and I thought this was a good scripture for 2012 my meat is to do the will of him that sent me amen and to finish his work you know finishing his work is a big part of this program brother brandom said all that God didn't complete in his Earthly journey is being completed now in the lady Jesus Christ that's the meat of the father let's pray this morning Heavenly Father we do want to do our part we want to do our our our portion Lord to be a part of the program of God and to finish this work we are in the finishing hours yeah what brother Brandon believing in the days that he stood here that it was the last hours the last days and and here 40 more years later we're still in those last finishing hours we don't understand the the time line we don't try to decipher it figure it out place a final date on it figure out how many are going all of those things will leave to others Lord but we just continue walking in your light as you lead us help us tonight this day as we as we go into the service help us as we look into the word let your word be blessed to the people we pray in your name amen amen God bless you may be seated this morning I I don't know whether to call it I don't have 1:00 Services usually so I might call it morning evening afternoon you just mean the one when you hear that just know it's the one we're in right now if I say tonight I'm not coming back tonight we're done after this so when you look up it's 1:30 you don't know when the start or stop you're just going to have to go until somebody pulls me down I reckon you know but uh I want to just thank you again for for the hospitality I enjoyed the the service with you last night I enjoyed the meal downstairs and and the fellowship getting to meet some of you and getting know you better we we only had met your your your your brethren here that come out to Kansas and visit with us and and so it's just good to see who they represent and to know next time we see them we'll be seeing y'all cuz you know what y'all look like now you know and so we appreciate all of those things and uh I do want you to remember as a a request to you tomorrow our pastor brother Pinkston who you met back at Easter time his his wife's mother who's been a part of the assembly there for the last last 11 years or so passed away this this weekend on Saturday so sister Gina's mom's funeral will be tomorrow and that certainly puts our brother Jim under a lot of pressure I know he's there ministering this morning as we got to log in for a few minutes with him and then he's got the funeral memorial service for his mother-in-law tomorrow so if y'all just are are wandering around tomorrow around lunchtime and think of them and just offer up a little a little prayer for the family there she's a sweet lady she's been a a part of our assembly and it just gives us somebody else on the other side pulling for us to get there that's right and U you know death doesn't doesn't alter our vision it doesn't alter our view it just gives us gives us a little more reward to go to right what brother Rand say he's just just hooking The Chariot death is just hooking on and pulling us some of us on over to the other side but whether we're asleep or whether we're awake it doesn't matter Paul said just to be found in him so so it's it's no disgrace to go on and it's no disgrace to stay right you know we had years ago I learned a little lesson we had two sisters in our assembly there in Florida both of them came down with breast cancer exactly at the same time within within days of each other they were both diagnosed one of them being leaning a little more to the medical side she wanted to have the doctor's treatment done for her cancer the chemotherapy and the radiation and all the things that they can do another sister saids no I just want to believe on the Lord because if it's my time to go and and he won't heal me then I'm where I'm supposed to be the it was no disgrace that the one sister passed and the one made it they chose different routes right now you get a lot of folks who say Well the lady with the doctor ought to went the other way well you know I don't know how strong y'all I don't know how much the medicine preachers got around to y'all in the days gone by but I've known of preachers that go out and dump out handbags to see who's got that devil Tylenol in their purse you know and all those kind of thing I remember years ago as a young man I went down to Hot Springs Arkansas and I was sitting in it was a Pentecostal church but we had met the brother and we were just visiting and and and them knowing we were in the message they had been in brother brandom's meetings down in Arkansas and and this man got up and and he wanted to give this testimony about how he went to Brother bram's service because he was having trouble with his eyes and he wanted to be healed and his whole testimony was he says you know I knew as soon as brother brandham came out that I wasn't going to get my healing because he took a pair of glasses out of his pocket and put them on and he he did that for my benefit I'm sure you know that that I knew that his faith was bursted by that little act right yeah you know there was I didn't bring it but there was one quote brother brandom said a man came to me and said brother brandom I can't believe you're eating sausage gravy you remember that yeah he said so if all I got to worry about keeping me out of Heaven is sausage gra he says I've been pretty good sh you know but uh but that that's just just how it is the Lord knows every one of our footsteps is ordered if he knew 10 million years before the world was ever founded that we would be here he knows where I'm going to be tomorrow you know the only surprises we have here in the end time is is us God knew God knew already every every step everything about it amen he knows and our steps are certainly ordered and ordained of him but but I did enjoy last night that's about as long as as I've ever preached or or wanted to ever preach that was you know I certainly heard about it afterwards because brother Wade was the last guy we had do two hours at our place and so now that I've even the score you know one guy with one brother I won't say who but he was telling me that you don't have rollover minutes when you go short and you don't I've done use my whole month's Supply up on my whole time plans finished up and why is it guys like that when you mention those quotes where brother BR said the ought to preach 30 or 45 minutes why do they just that's all they ever hear right why is that you know they like those don't they you usually get some amens out of that so to balance the score I have another quote for you this morning is that okay cuz I don't want to leave and brother Dale be all under pressure about time so so so this is out of a message called the unwelcome Christ and brother B's talking about how we got time for other things he says we got time for other things and he's in quotes he's speaking as if a man's out there a fellow would say oh I wish he'd hurry up and quit preaching 20 minutes is long enough for any preacher to preach now that's what somebody out in the crowd is saying he said why he says you're starving to death you're so thin you look like a shadow you need everybody ready now you need a good 4our sermon sometimes right right how many believe this message all right y'all with me you need not you ought to have but you need a good 4our sermon sometime to fatten you up on gospel vitamins that's what the church needs today amen so don't get all upset if he decides that that that 3 weeks from today y'all need a good 4-Hour sermon amen because he's got a quote to back him up you know I'm not am I making that up is that what it says yeah that's what mine says you need you guys that think 20 minutes is long enough you're the ones that need a good 4 sometime in another place brother says the church needs some vitamins it's got anemic it's it's become anemia its nerve system has run down y now I'll tell you God's got a whole Storehouse full of vitamins yes sir amen that's right it'll beat all they got in the drugstore a you know had a call going to take the place of the just accept them spiritual vitamins and it'll Build You Up A peculiar people a holy nation amen and amen and amen how many believe that that's right so just keep that in mind you need it if if you if you get a 4 hour coming up then just remember you need that I don't know why you needed that right I'm going to just live by my my my friends from Trinidad's slogan there though if we go three hours and it's seems like 45 minutes and we have not done an injustice because most of us don't start count until we get done rambling anyway see we actually need one of those time clocks that when we start preaching then we can put it on and then if we diverse out and do a little more rambling then we can stop the clock and then we go back to preaching we can put it back on again and if your pastor is so inclined to do a little meddling during his meddling time you can put a little time out there as well yeah a man ought to preach only 45 minutes there the rambling medling warming up and cooling down period should not count against him is that all right come on see the thing is you all start the clock as soon as you fall into your chair yeah oh clock's on now he's not on the clock yet he ain't warmed up he ain't rambled he ain't medled he ain't done none of those things yet he gets 45 minutes preaching yeah there you go it's just the way I'm just just trying to help I'm going to be long gone I just want to help before you know I just want to I just want to help all I can I like to balance I like to be balanced how many believe this message has a balance that's why it's talking we all I know yall agree with me on Christmas man people get so bound up about Christmas brother Jim a couple weeks ago took a little message and he he took one place place where brother random said Christmas ought not to be a celebration he said it ought to be a worship it ought to be a time of Honor we shouldn't be celebrating Christmas and then in another message sometime later he says now we're entering into our Christmas celebration this week so which way is it do we celebrate or don't we celebrate there is a balance to this word and most of the legalism and most of the false things that have come out of this message is because one guy swayed too far right one way or the other because because they only read one batch of quotes and didn't read the whole message and that's why I printed out all those Christmas messages you listen to all 17 or 18 of them how many there were and you decide what brother Brandon believed about Christmas you decide what he believed about any event right but instead of that you know what we'll always do we just run ask the pastor let me ask him what we believe why don't you search it out for yourself exactly well you know this you got the if you don't have the message on your computer I know brother Jim got real excited at home one time he said if you ain't got the message on your computer you don't even have the Holy Ghost now I never saw brother Brandon qualified that way because back in his day he didn't even know there was going to be a computer and a message to have on the computer but I loved it that's right what you got a computer in your house for if it ain't got the quotes on right where that you can hear Brother Wade or Brother Sam stand up and say something and you maybe didn't get it just right rather than burn the telephone line up to ask him what he me why don't you go read it yourself and God will show you what the true intention of that was so I hope you all Scurry home and get it on your computers or according to brother Jim you ain't even got the holy ghost son that's his Doctrine I'm not I was grateful at the time I had about five computers in my house and they all had it on it so I was just glad that I passed the the litmus test but do use the know these resources to be able to print off the quotes I started preaching in 1979 we didn't have the computer we didn't have the message info base and for us to bring you a quote we had to get it out of the books and so when we all come up here you remember how we all showed up like this we had books under our arms out both sides because we had one quote and we didn't have copy machines most of us so we had to bring all them books we had them marked up lined up we had them paragraphed and paper clip and and yellowed out and highlighted exactly and then the computer came along and it led us not only look at those that were in print which I think in 1979 when I started preaching we might had a couple of hundred of the books in print by then 200 maybe 300 now you can print them all but at that time we just had a A small collection of them right y we had the what Jeffersonville deemed the most important ones and I never knew how they figured that out yeah you know there was a little gospel Doctrine going around way back in the old days I remember that there was tapes that were divided in categories some of them were called seed tapes remember those days exactly did you get that off of one of those seed tapes well well I thought all of the spoken word was the original seed so but they would ask you that was that off of a seed tape well I'm not sure which one that was you're referring to but they had a little collection of of Christ the mystery and mighty God unveil and power transformation those were the seed tapes the Rapture you know but um anyway that's what we had to work with now you got the computer right and you got the message to put on it and it's it's available don't go without it don't take an opportunity if you got 10 minutes spare time I know you want to play with the grandchildren but go look up something go put it in your mind go dwell on it right exactly don't don't don't forsake the grandchildren Let Them Sit along with you on your knee while you read and while you look let that be a part of your life that's right let this message be more important to you than any other aspect of your life right let it be so that's my prayer for this year Lord let it be more real to me more important more valuable than it's ever been before amen that is my prayer that's my prayer for you as well but again back to to our home Church they remember our brothers tomorrow our sister Pinkston and the loss of her mothers two of her other daughters attend the assembly there so there's a little bit of sadness in the home front but we pray that the Lord will just help them help them and encourage them today we're going to just continue a little thought that we we began there at the end last night uh uh especially about what brother Bram talked about bypassing the regular procedure you know that I mentioned just some common common carnal things that's hard on us guys you know right how that we fail so many times in believing you know I I just I'm just I just like everything you know I like what the scripture said let everything be done decently and in order right and so in order is is diverted but I would like to read with you one more place if you will over in Mark chapter 2 Mark the 2 chapter I'd like to read this and it'll help us get into our subject I did want to thank brother Wade for the hospitality of his home he opened up his his house to us there gave us a lovely a lovely place place to stay and everything we need Diet Coke in the fridge and and everything is there so I appreciate that brother thank you for that it's just an honor to to share your home with you like that amen but in Mark chapter 2 we find verse 23 a very unusual an unusual little scene in in the ministry of Our Lord verse 23 it came to pass that he went through the corn fields on the Sabbath day and his disciples began as they went to pluck the ears of corn and the Pharisees said unto him now you know I just want to stop for a minute these disciples were not untrained unlearned completely I know Peter was a little ignorant at times but some of them had some some learnings right some of them have been around Church long enough to know you know you look at Luke The Physician you look at and some of the other apostles were they were not just just totally incoherently doing something that the Pharisees all I'm trying to say is the Pharisees didn't need to be the first ones to point it out I mean Jesus and the disciples are going through the corn field and his disciples began as they went to pluck the ears of corn and the Pharisees said behold why do they on the Sabbath day that which is not lawful it wasn't like the 12 disciples were standing around saying H we didn't know yeah yeah come on we didn't know what we were doing we you mean we can't pluck corn on the Sabbath it wasn't like Jesus stopped as he said about John and send him a book of conduct on how to behave while he's in prison right he didn't stop his disciples and say what are you doing why are you why are you breaking the Sabbath let me show you my pamphlet on how to observe the sabbath yeah yeah let's go back and read Church order again and make sure that we're doing it exactly right he's going through the Field of Corn his his disciples are plucking the corn but it's the Pharisees that get riled up about it right now one thing I don't know of course there's some debate whether this is truly corn because all of us have pluck corn I mean but it could be wheat it could be corn there's a great debate among all the theologians about which one it is but if it was truly corn as we know corn and they were out plucking ears of corn and the Pharisees are on the tear it would be easy to hide yourself in a field of corn and not be discovered yeah right come on we've all been in corn fields how many ever played a game of hiding in the cornfield sure unless you see the top of the stalk Rippling they could have avoided these Pharisees but obviously they were coming out to the end of the rad with a big old armload of corn yeah they weren't just just they were not trying to conceal their activities this is what I'm wanting to say to you am I think sometimes we get all worried and frustrated and worked up about not letting somebody else know how we do it down in our church you in one of those scenarios I've got a I've got a website but it's password protected we'll find the world you want to have a p a website with your sermons on it if you've got a password protected why bother to build this website well I don't want nobody to hear what I'm saying well don't have a website then now y I hope y'all ain't password protected after saying all that because we we want to have a church we want to have a little a little commune of of people here and we want to do it our way and we don't want nobody else to know how we do it the disciples weren't like that this was in plain view of the Pharisees because I want you to know something brothers and sisters no matter how many times we read Church order no matter how many times we measure the sister's hymn at the door and their heels as they walk in that somewhere along the way we're not going to get it right oh somebody's going to show up a little off a little out of kilter because we're measuring it by man's standard right I want to say this to you and I mean it with all my heart there is a we were left with church order brother random laid down what we call Church order to help us have an order in our services but I want you to know there is a higher order than that there is an order that's called bride order amen and if we are in Bride order we don't have to worry about church order because Bri order supersedes Church order if your heart is right to dress right live right act right do everything right Y and your heart is right between you and God concerning those things then you'll never break Church order right bride order super supersedes Church order if you see a a member a a long standing member a newcomer whoever it may be breaking Church order to the rule this is exactly what was happening the Pharisees says hey wait a minute your disciples aren't acting like the law said they should act you're the people in your church ain't doing it the way we do it down at our church and we believe in church order come on brother brothers and sisters Jesus said verse 25 and he said un them have you never read oh man nothing like taking it back to somebody they had confidence in right have you never read what David did when he had need and was hungry he and they that were with him how he went into the house of God in the days of abiathar the high priest and he ate the showbread right it's not lawful to eat but for the priest and he not only ate it but he gave also to them that were with him broke Church order yeah have you never read that David got out of line back there that David broke the order of the law he broke the Commandment he broke the the the defined definition of how the church ought to act yeah but you let a person get crosswise with the assembly you know what the first thing they'll Point as is church order y'all do this and y'all do that yall do this and yall do that we're all still looking for the perfect church right yeah right the perfect Church exactly do you think one exists the perfect church I got a little po you want to PO how many know poetry is good brother Jim read this years ago and I I I took it's on the internet and you'll find it there but this is called the perfect Church no perfect church is the title of this point and it goes like this I think that I shall never see a church that's all it ought to be a church whose members never stray beyond the straight and narrow way a church that has no empty pews whose Pastor never has the Blues a church whose deacons always deak and none is proud and all are Meek where gossips never pedal lie or make complaints or criticize right where all are always sweet and kind and all to others faults are blind such perfect churches there may be but none of them are known to me but still we work and pray and plan to make our own the best we can is't that the right desire to have right no perfect Church sorry to burst your bubble right we have church order to help and guide us but there will be a perfect Church come out of all the imperfection that we can muster up right because when he saw her walking on that straight highway and she began to wave her off to the side he screamed and said get back in line and it caught her attention and it got her back in line right amen and that's the confidence we have in the word here in the end time right that it's little B and blemishes of the record hit along the way that God will take care of that the first thing we do though is we ran run and get our church order book yeah we get our we get what brother brandom said right here and he said right here and he said right here and he said over there and we begin to play the church order over and over and over just because of of of a blemish of imperfection right we're not perfect yet brothers and sisters every one of us and I I try everywhere I go and as often as I can speak into congregations I I just want to ask you every day that you go to your job are you always on form that's what you know but we look at our dear Pastor he' been here what 40 Years 1972 I think you were telling me somewhere in there that you started the assembly here it why is it that we'll show up on our jobs sometimes and just be half there come on come on this ain't going to be fun is it this is my medling time put me off the clock right here why is it that we can show up down on the assembly line and not be on 100% form come on maybe we got a headache maybe we didn't get enough sleep last night maybe we had a scrap with the wife on the way yeah before we got to work and we're not on 100% form but yet when our pastor stands behind the pull pit day after day doing his job yeah it's always got to be exactly right yeah come on why is that yeah not fair right I'm a preacher I'm going to declare it now foul you don't know that maybe he's got a headache this morning maybe he kicked the cat on the way out the door it's not fair right you require that every time he's up here if he if he were to repeat himself from last week I know our folks at home will do it brother Jimmy already said that so what so what but we're required well you already preached that here while back we've already heard that move on to something else since when did you get to quarterback what God is doing and since when is he placed in such a pedestal that he's got to be on Forum every week give him a chance to have a bad day sometimes brother random had bubles and little blips on the radar right sure surely you remember 77,000 oh man he no more than got it out than they were already sitting in the question did you mean 77,000 yeah I got so tired of him having to correct that 77,000 did you it's we're all humans right we wake up like you do we we go to sleep like you do and some nights we don't get enough like you do like last night I see you all nodding out there as I get into my 4our sermon you need a 4-Hour sermon all I'm saying brothers and sisters is with the same Grace that you need give it to our brother here as he stands in the desk we don't come behind this desk every day in tiptop shape right we don't come here in perfect form we have headaches we have aches in our body we have groanings we have travailing we have things that are heavy on our mind like you do when you go to your job right so if he if he if a little blip on the radar shows up don't run and grab Church order and let him know that was too long this was too short the singing's too loud the music the preaching there's always going to be something that we maybe could do a little better right oh yeah we I could always do a better job preaching than what I do but give our brothers some Grace but this is this was a noticeable event in the disciples life it was not the regular routine right here Jesus and the disciples are going through the Cor and they're plucking corn and the Pharisees are like foul they're they're calling a foul on them what what are your disciples doing it's the Sabbath right he was bypassing the regular procedure right and rather than just say hey wait a minute I I just want you to know that I told them they could and so take that and put that in your pipe and smoke it because that's just the way it is yeah I'm afraid so much of the message preaching has gone to that this is what brother BR said and this is the way I see it and you just Believe it or else you're just lost oh come on you've had enough of those preachers come by I imagine in your life it's this way and this is the only way it can be and if you don't believe it you're just out you're not going to make it and Cults have rose up inside of this message preaching all kind of foul things and finding quotes to back it up churches filled with polygamy Believers believing that somehow brother Brandon thought polygamy was okay yeah polygamy was not okay it's not okay in our society you know old but they'll that quote up and brother and S I would rather America be a polygamous Nation than what we've got yeah so they're all saying amen that's exactly right yeah they forgot to go on read and he says now you know I don't believe in polygamy but he was just looking at it being a better alternative right I was having some fellowship here while back up in Ohio with a brother and his his daughter was was was liking a a man that was attending a polygamy Church the pastor was preaching the polygamy was okay and here this man's daughter is in it is is struck up a relationship with a boy out of there if I was the dad you know what I'd be asking I wouldn't even actually be asking any I'd be saying ain't no way this is going to be happening amen the answer was well yeah I attend this church and I I know they believe in polygamy and I really believe it but I would never do it come on right something's not adding up here I believe it I believe it but I would never do it yeah believe it but never do it that's fine when you're young and healthy and beautiful and your wife has not got no wrinkles and the crows feet haven't showed up you're believing it now but wait until you both get old and gray and you think that there's something out there for you more wild and wonderful than what you have brothers and sisters all I'm saying to you is that there's things that you can make the message say I was talking to this brother and you know what his defense was he took a quote where brother brandom said you men go on and live with your wives yeah you men out there go and live with your wives and they took that to be that brother brandham was enforcing polygamy he could have had two men sitting there with two wives that he was talking to right and the and the quote men entirely something different from that right but we've had 45 years now to take these quotes and to make them say things that they didn't say we we we've had an opportunity to to take the message and because of the computer and all of its wonderful help it can also be a curse because everybody can run and and and and try to find something Al alternately different y i I liked what our brother said last night Paul said if you got to preach it out of condition contention I'm glad that it's preached exactly but it's a whole lot nicer when it's not out of contention EXA all I'm saying to you brothers and sisters is that there is a church order there's a perfect way that everything in our mind we have decided it should be done but if it varies let's just believe that God God leads his dear children along if it doesn't measure up to exactly the way you think it ought to be yeah I went to a church I attended had a years ago when I was single dated a girl over in Arkansas at a church and every time if a if a sister had a little struggle in the faith or a young person or whatever and a girl would trim her hair they had questions and answers every Sunday morning yeah you let you let a young sister have a struggle and and maybe just trim off her hair a little bit or something there'd be the question on the pull pit what did Brother random say about a woman cutting her hair yeah they didn't they already knew what brother random said and the whole church already knew what brother random said but they just wanted that girl pounded on for a while and so the pounding would begin that's not what this gospel was to do if you see a brother overtaken in a fall amen pray for that man hold up for that man he is your brother he has claimed this body as a part of his assembly as a part of his place of worship believe in that man with him pray those young people through those struggles help them through those hard times that they go through amen unless you were never young and never had any Hard Times yourself right yes I I can remember my youth I know you're thinking that wasn't very long ago and that's true it wasn't very long ago not like the not like these birthday people over here I didn't know it was your birthday I I got you something you know there's the 26 you got time oh I got time all right bypassing here's our Point bypassing the regular procedure I don't know what 2012 is going to entail for us I don't know I you know I'll give you my little testimony about how I got to Kansas we were we were just tripping along in 2010 and everything was fine and and we had lived in Florida for 21 years we had began to help brother Pinkston more in the ministry there I was more in Kansas it seemed like preaching than I was at home we had a desire in our hearts to move but really didn't have any unction to make it happen and so I'm down at Office Depot on January the 2nd of last year of actually 2011 which would be last year and I'm down there buying my yearly planning calendar because I sell life insurance and I keep a a desk calendar there on my desk and every day I write down what I should have done today and what I need to do tomorrow and and all those things as you should do have some kind of an organization to your life and I'm walking through Office Depot I've been renting a house from a man in Florida for 8 and 1/2 years and I'm walking through Office Depot with a calendar in my hand getting ready to plan out my year and my cell phone rings and my landlord says you know my daughter's got another baby now she's having a bigger family and I need you to move out of my house oh thank you after 8 and 1/2 years of renting from this man we're friends we're buddies I'm just standing there with my calendar in my hand hand fixing to plan out my year and he says I need you to move out of the house I said wow Dennis how how much time have I got he said well you February 1st would be fine and this is January the 2 I put my yearly calendar back I got a monthly calendar because that was all I needed I didn't know on January 2nd I was going to be moving on February 1st right so then we're sitting there and then the choice has got to be made do we move into another house and just burn the road up between Kansas and home or do we move to Kansas and so now for a year I've been in Kansas if they put up with me one more month they've had me for a year now so that just shows we don't know what God has planned for us me walking through there I was thinking ahead I got to do this for my business I got to do that I got to keep paying the bills I got to work my rent up and then I didn't even need no more rent money in Florida that is so what timing did here I am and it was such a such a a sign to me here I am planning out my life with my very next year holding it in my hands fixing to go pay for it and just one phone call in your life has changed that's how we need to be brothers and sisters amen just just be pliable be be be bendable be moldable to whatever God would have for you right we've enjoyed our year out there the Saints are are are a blessing to be with if you ever get to travel and vacation we we we got to feed these guys while were out there we didn't we didn't get to sleep them we almost did but brother Chad stole brother Wade and and brother brother schroer took Brother Sam and and bunked them down but if you ever travel through we got we got our home open to you You' love our fellowship you love our the family there of the Lord but that's all I'm trying to say to you is as we go into 2012 if if a little blip a little something that's not the regular routine if we bypass the regular procedure maybe God is molding us a different way he's bending us a different way here Jesus is walking through the corn with the disciples and they're eating corn you can't tell me that he didn't know what the law said he was the one who wrote the law come on these guys weren't surprising him what are your disciples doing the law says it's not lawful for them the law says Jesus could have just throw back his chest and say I wrote the law why you telling me this but he said here's what the law really said that I am the lord of the Sabbath that the Sabbath was not made for church order but but the Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath the the son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath amen and you know what if you really want he says if you want to get really down to technicalities what about David yeah you know I shut him up you know go back go back to the source you you believe in David did you never read what he did yeah Church order vers bride order I believe brothers and sisters that we are entering into a bride order yeah I'm not going to say we're going to do everything perfect all the way through 2012 I'm not going to say we're not going to have a pothole in the road or a stump rise up in front of us isn't it amazing how them stumps can jump in our way sometime we're just driving down the road all a sudden there's a pothole there we don't know where it came from my wife can't miss any of them so I know they're all there there you man I'm glad I got some good Brothers here that'll agree with me on this I got the biggest amens out of my GPS sermon last night anything else I don't know why when she's driving my Buick she can't miss none of them no man I guess she just wants me to know the rose need repairing I don't know but it's not really that bad I hit one the other day and believe me I heard about it on the way here yeah let me not swerve quite far enough that's what legalism will do for you exactly she was preaching driveing order she had no Grace that's right bypassing the regular procedure here's what brother let me just read you a few quotes I am going to not use up much of your time he's what we were talking about last night he broke off the fish his fish growed out he broke off the bread every time he'd break it off another piece would grow on cooked fish already cooked fried and crisco ready to go ready grown what a person brother Rand says not break it off and raise up some wheat and go cook it and things like that he he says the regular procedure y he didn't do the regular procedure but he could bypass all of that right and he could just break off cook bread and hand it out to them with brown crust on it and said take it and eat it and you know there's such a lesson in that you know Jesus has got 5,000 men and all their women and their children sitting there waiting on food he could have spoke a mountain of bread into existence and fed them he could have spoke a mountain and they could have rushed it like a mad angry mob and gathered up all the food they wanted if he had chose to do it that way but he had a way that he wanted it to be done and it was that I will break the bread I will hand it to my Ministry and the ministry will then hand it to the people right I will break it the ministry will be handed every one of them's got a basket there's 12 12 disciples there they all got basket right I'm going to break it off I'm going to give it to the disciples and the disciples are going to give it to the people come on brother can we go through the procedure again I'm going to break it give it to the ministry the ministry to the people I'm going to break it give it to the ministry the ministry to the people amen not the people get it for themselves right you do get it for yourself study at home learn at home read your books listen to those tapes amen but there's an Avenue that God has provided Peter and Andrew and Thomas and even Judas each one of those disciples had a basket one of them had fried one of them had boiled and one of them had babed but you take you wanted to eat from but there was something that that that God wanted us to understand the scripture says he broke it gave it to the disciples the disciples to the people and that pattern is still true today you are not going to go higher than your pastor the greatest mistake brother Rand let us know is when people want to go higher farther deeper y Lord help us but this is what brother random called the regular procedure he Bast all of that he just broke off cooked bread and handed it out to them amen with brown crust on it right in a message called at Thy word he's talking about the water he turned the water to wine now that water would have been wine someday perhaps but it'll have to go through the regular procedure of going up into the gra Vine coming out into of the grap being brought back and so forth like that but Jesus just bypassed all of that right because he was the god of nature right doesn't that ring true in our day that the god of nature was on the scene again Glory that the god of nature was on the scene you know there was a regular routine to get those squirrels on that limb there was a regular routine a couple of squirrels could have hooked up in the woods had baby squirrels of squirrels could have run out but there were no squirrels there right there was a regular proced that Abraham could have got a ram back in his day he could have went down to the farmer bought a ram offered the RAM on the sacrifice on top of the mountain but there was something Supernatural about this because when he had that dagger raised to to to slash the throat of his son he heard the ram hooked up in the wilderness over there right and you know the wonderful thing about it is Abraham didn't even have to chase the ram around he was tied up to the bush right I tell you brothers and sisters when God takes care of his people he takes care of his Abraham didn't get all worked up come here Ramy Ramy I need to have a sacrifice he's tied his horns are caught in the bush amen it's God providing the sacrifice I will provide I will be Jehovah gy amen that's why I get sideways with people they'll move 200 miles for a job M I got to feed my family and I believe God has given me this job and it's going to take me out of the church and I'll be 200 miles away but I believe that's the will of the Lord you need to think about that again why don't we find any people the way it was in brother Brandon's day moving to where the word was at right you know we fought all of them that wanted to move out to Arizona and brother brand tried to get them not to but I appreciated the fact that they even wanted to go right if he was if if you gave me a call and said brother R's preaching somewhere I tell you what I want to be in the meeting right I'm not going to just totally kick them to the curb because they were all trying to rush out to Arizona y I wasn't wasn't living back then I didn't have to make that choice but if brother BR said I'm going to be living in Arizona for a while I'd be packing up my car right but all we we we get sideways with all them folks that did that you know we do we well you know what's the matter brother stay where you are but here in our day we'll get people who say the lord gave me a job I need a better job it's 200 miles away I ain't going to get to be in church I got to take my family out of church n and that's the will of the Lord that is not the will of the Lord I don't need to be spiritual or a prophet to tell you that the regular process would say yes that's a good job I need that job but I believe God can give you everything you need as you stay in Fellowship under the word as you stay in your home church as you support the assembly and as you are faithful to the post that God has called you to do we don't hear of anybody saying well I'm just going to quit my job and move 200 miles so I can be in church no if we heard a guy testify that be like something wrong with that guy then quit his job since when did the job become more important than your spiritual life since when did your livelihood take preeminence over the serving the the true and Living Word that we have in our day it's because that's what leoa taught you to believe you got to go where the job is I believe God will bring the job to you you'll just sit still and believe and trust in him I've seen it happen I sold cars for a living I can relate to our brother's plight here selling cars i' I've stood in in a in a Ford dealership there in Florida when I first got there I ended up for most of my life selling GMS and Pontiacs and Buicks and praise the Lord for that I got away from those Fords but in the Ford store oh man I see that's medling Town take off the just a minute that's medling town right there but I was selling fors everybody say yeah I'll buy it and then you couldn't get a finance down at the Ford Store yeah I'll buy it we try to run the paper through and nobody got bought Buick and Cadillac store the folks come in they were a little more seem to be a little more better off I don't know why that is it just just lended itself to that but I've saw in my own life I stand there needing to feed my family got no groceries no no way to pay the bills 19 other salesman conglomerated smoking outside the door and I watch customers just weave their way right on through them and me sitting in my office moping and pouting yeah and coming in and say can you show me this car now here yeah it didn't didn't stand the reason they bypassed all the smokers and Drinkers and alcoholics and found me the day Jehovah of miracles on the scene amen and it would work out I don't know how it worked out but it just worked out because God will bring it to you brothers and sisters don't ever get in don't never let the dev tell that you got to go somewhere lead Church to make a living God will bring what you need to youen may not bring all everything you want to you bring what you need that's right yeah if we could ever get our wants hooked up with our needs we' be better off right bypassing the regular procedure Jesus just bypassed right all of that here in another message at that word brother R says this this is 1954 same title just like at the beginning of his ministry he had went out and performed a miracle and turned water into wine brother BR says how I'd like to beat on that just for a minute to show what he will do in the resurrection right yep how many of you knew you could read the story about turning the water into the wine and you could find out how it's going to be in the resurrection right exactly how it eventually would have been wine it would have been wine all right and it went up through the vine and into the grape and out to the vat and it soured and fermented it come on out and was wine but he just bypassed every bit of that and he made it from Water to Wine s that's the way he will do in the res Resurrection right I won't have to live and be a 22 or 23 year old at my best again my being a be an old man shaken and broke down like that he'll just change it oh man I'll make everybody say Amen on brother he will just change it just bypass all that Mrs Brandon and Mr Brandon won't have to be constituted or anything involved in my birth he will just call me from the dust and I'll be just what I was at my best and so you amen I love the little poster the little artwork you've got downstairs there with those Saints pictures on there you know we ain't got to worry about knowing who they are when we get over there it's nice you got those pictures but brother BR says you're going to know who they are he say you're going to come up with your generation you know the one thing that there's not going to be in heaven introductions you're never going to have to hey who is that person over there you're going to know him brother Bren but I love that I love that little little little picture frame you got down there all those saints that have went on before that's right that's what brother Brown said he'll bypass all of that I'll be just what I was at my best Y and so will you that's it amen somebody say praise the Lord praise the Lord that's right I'm not at my best now right even at 19 I probably wasn't at my best I'll be honest you I don't think I've ever hit my best yet I I think the best is yet to come because I wasn't all that great at 19 or 20 or 21 whatever age you want to pick right I wasn't a real Prime candidate for for Resurrection then right but God's going to bring me back in the image that he saw me I'm just bypass and it is I be not afraid he was young he he's talking about John again John was saying I just can't understand how there was more baked bread if he would have had an oven and baked it and had the wheat and so forth I might have understood it but he didn't he bypassed the procession and the regular natural run of raising wheat and gring it and Milling it and sifting it and shortenings and salt and seasoning and putting it in the oven and but he just broke it and handed it out just broke it and handed it out that's right he bypassed all that it is it every time he broke a piece of bread off no sooner than his hand left there was another piece of bread am I want to ask you what kind of an atom did he turn loose not wheat but bread not wheat bread already baked it bypass the oven like he did his first miracle in can the water would have eventually become wine it went up through the vines into the grave crushed out become wine but he bypassed all of that right he was a Creator himself so in the great Resurrection he will bypass Papa and Mama and give birth to this he will speak and will'll come from the dust Glory like he did last amen that's what we're heading for Lord Amen brother random asked that question I didn't bring the quote but he asked that question he said How's God's going to find those those Gladiators and all those people that were eaten by the Lions those Christians that were fed to the Lions here they are scattered out over the face of the earth and the tongue of the lion how's God going to call that back but he said he will call it back he'll call and those Adams will reassemble themselves again and we'll we came from this Earth we went back to this earth and we'll be called forth out of this Earth again though the skin worms destroy this body and in my flesh shall I see that is exactly the truth he bypassed all the routines of nature he is God you fail to see who he is this is an unchangeable God he's the unchanging blood I've got I'm glad I've got faith in him tonight and someday when my life my body with it 16 elements will be back in the dust of the Earth right but he will say William brandom and I'll come forth he will breathe the breath of life into it and say there you are he'll bypass the birth through my mother and so forth at the resurrection he will not say Mr and Mrs brandom get married again and bring forth William but he will speak and I'll come forth amen that's him he's God Amen brothers and sisters this we say unto you by the word of the lord we which are alive and remain will not prevent or hinder them which are asleep but we shall all be changed in the moment in a twinkling somebody's going to be living I believe it 42 years ago when this message first came to me and I still believe it now those that have went on ahead of us they just given us something else to go and enjoy right brothers and sisters there's no discredit in death and there's no credit in living whether we live or die we need to be accepted of him is all that is matter this Resurrection is on its way it might be in 2012 I could have took a lot of time on the Mayan calendar for you this morning how many would rather had a sermon on the Mayan calendar I saw a good cartoon the other day just a few days ago while we've been on this trip two Mayans were standing there talking to each other one of them had his Mayan calendar all draw out and he said you know one of these days they're going to be disappointed to find out I just ran out of paper that's what the Mayans were really thinking when they wrote that they're going to be really disappointed to find out I just ran out of room at 2012 right we could discuss I saw a thing on the internet yesterday NASA has debunked the the 2012 Mayan calendar myth quit reading about the Mayan calendar we have got a better calendar we have got a word of the Lord that says it it's going to happen oh my believe it brothers and sisters we are in the change season I don't know what day it's going to happen you know brother Brandon we all want to go back let me grab a quote and I'll tell you how many there's going to be and when it's going to be y'all ever had any date Setters around here you remember the little purple book out of Jeffersonville you got to get old for this one now remember little by 1977 I me remember when that circulated through the message everybody had one we were reading them by 1977 it's because we just weren't in tune with what God was doing we were we were taking quotes and we were making them say something that maybe they weren't going to say but brother Bram knew exactly when it was going to be you I got the answer for you you want to know here here it is it's taking sides with Jesus we got to be looking for him right now we don't know it could be a hundred years from now yep how many remember this quote when is it going to be brother brand it could be a hundred years from now this was 1962 it could be 500 years oh man we're getting disappointed now aren't we yeah A Thousand Years y 10,000 years I don't know y nobody knows but say for instance that we live each day that he was coming that day right if we live like he was coming this day when we awake if we sleep and we awake in the resurrection it will be just as fresh as if we had just fallen asleep and just woke up the trumpet sound the dead in Christ arise we which are alive and remain should caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air so it will be just as fresh right but until that time until he comes we want to live each day like he might come the next minute because it might be the end of your life at that minute that's way too simple isn't it amen no I'd rather figure out what day it's going to be it's going to be October it's going to be this year it's going to be 84 it's going to be 89 it's going to be all the dates that we've had along the way but brother BR says I don't know and you don't know but here here's the remedy to fix it let's just live today like it could be today and if it is today we're not going to be surprised when it comes and if we go to sleep and we wake up we're going to be just like we're battling right on the W anyway it will be just as fresh that's one of the big questions when's it going to all end yeah you know I am a life insurance sales and I've done it for 20 something years now 1991 I got my license and you know what I did for all the Believers being a kind believer in this message if you buy a 20-year life insurance policy it's more expensive than a 10-year policy so back in the early 90s I told all my believer friends that were buying insurance from me I said just buy a 10-year plan it's cheaper and surely we're going to be gone by then yeah yeah see that's mixing business with the word ain't it I said surely we're going to be gone at the end of 10 years and you've been able to pay less this whole time and life is good and now they're all calling me my 10year plan is up right I've even got some now calling me saying my 20-year plan is up right yeah I don't know when it's going to be that's right but let's just live today like it could be today or tomorrow am Glory that's right the next big question we have in the message is how many is it going to be oh man that's that's a fun one cuz we can gather all the quotes and it looks like just so few and we think in that same message brother man we think about the coming of the Lord being a great thing the message remember there's a there is a predestinated group to be here when the Lord returns and it might not be over a dozen yep right see we don't know now remember he just said it might not be over a dozen see we don't know it might be aund million Y which way we going to take it a dozen that's quite a quite quite a gap ain't it right might not be a dozen might not be over a dozen it might be a 100 million might be 10,000 but if the predestinated will hear the message and believe it if it's God's if it's the message sin of God which we believe it to be the right number will be there that's I paraphrased that last part that's what brother random is telling us the right number right brothers and sisters we're not going to get down to the marriage supper of the lamb and find out that God didn't have enough chairs for us right right I am I just want to break that news to you now you know years ago I used to hear ddy Rambo sing that song Set another seat at the table because a child of God is coming home that song wasn't right at all now ddy Rambo I like some of her songs but that wasn't one of my favorites because I looked at the word and the word says if you are elect you got a chair for you exactly you're not going to get over there and find out somebody took your seat you're not going to get over there and find out that there was too many places and there's Empty Chairs there's there's if if God can look at Israel and say I'm going to get 144,000 of them then surely he can be numerically correct enough that when we get to the marriage supper of the Lamb we're all going to have a seat we're not going to have to push our brother aside so we can get in there that he has set just the right amount of places that God's not readjusting the dining hall when somebody else gets saved that's right he knows how many He Knows My Name brother oh aren't you glad for that this morning aren't you glad that the word is that true and real in your heart that you believe that when he does call you home there's a place for you I believe it let's stand to our feet if we can oh maybe our musicians will come we'll try to sing something for with you this morning amen you love thank you for being such a kind and gracious audience I don't even know how long I went it's 2:20 you're doing okay didn't even use an hour today how' that do am I good done well
