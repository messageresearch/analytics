thing but you got to get the message for your day or you miss it all you got to be into the message of the hour and we sure do appreciate the Lord giving us um some updated songwriters that writes about serpent seed and recognizing your day because nobody in any other age could do that they didn't know anything about it they knew Jesus Christ they knew he saved their soul they lived with God they did the best they could do and then they went on right but you and I have a commission we got to go further we got to grow amen so let's uh let's just realize that that's what our whole we're going to talk about a little bit today on growth uh you know the some of you I know brother Gary Atkins he uh he enjoyed my plum tree that I planted 20s something years ago and you know I was looking at the other day brother Donnie and and I thought well when I planted it in 2020 I mean 2002 that this thing had never grow we were going in a Rapture and you know all this was going to uh big vibrant tree you know comes out and brother George is just big old plums and people would come and eat them we made plum jelly people made plum jelly people come by eat till we was Plum full of plums but now that tree is dead he had a few branch anches this year but we're going to have to cut him down but he did what he supposed to do we enjoyed it we enjoyed the other ages we enjoyed even brother brandom but now they've gone on they've done their job it's left up to the bride in a many membered body to carry that on and and and produce that fruit again because the tree you look at it now you look at it 20 years ago and it was just beautiful I mean it had big old plums on it but you look at it now and it's it's just old and nothing on it but that's the cycle of Life yes that we come to that we all come to I was thinking about today this morning about us getting older and then I looked at and I saw that tree and I'm like well that's the cycle of the way it is but you know what I got another one planted and it's only about that big around so I hope I don't see that one 20 years brother John to make as we say in the South a mess of plums but um but we have the word of the Lord and we must carry on all right let's remember Brother Louis uh some of you are on the um uh on WhatsApp I know most of the uh church is here but they are sending pictures and they are there safely brother Lis and brother um Michael are there brother Aaron will be leaving December 1st to go and he'll be there along with them and also Christian Morales brother Christian from um Ohio he's going also so so they're going down there and I I last night we had a wonderful time at at Brother Martin vs down in lawrencville and uh had a good crowd of of brothers and sisters and I told them I said Hispanic people have a place in my heart sometimes just heartburn when I eat their food but I have a place in my heart for the Hispanic people because with brother Lis here it's opened up a new Avenue and as brother Luis and I were talking before he left that um we want to see some wonderful things with the Hispanic Community amen cuz they're Sons and Daughters of God also amen so there'll be some announcements on that a little bit later about U some things that we want to try to do with them so uh you love the Lord let's just remember them also let's just let's go right down the list uh there'll no be no bible study on the second day of December we're already in the end of the year we not won't have any Bible study because usually we don't in December cuz people doing things so no bible study on the second uh brother Bob will be preaching this Wednesday night um December the 9th brother Burley called me this morning and they're going to have a bonfire at his church brother um um what's his name brother Jack Duff will be with with them that weekend and we'll have a bonfire starting at 4:00 I'm going to try to go and some of you might ought to try to go to and support brother Bley but that will be on December the night at 4:00 that's on a Saturday and um it'll run till when he said it's just singing no no no U no preaching just worship singing around the campfire or bonfire and uh and have some uh time of Fellowship amen just remember that also December the 10th will be our church dinner which will be the next day after that we'll only have one service here and then we'll go to Hidden acres and have our dinner catered there and uh give out all the gifts and things that we do at Christmas time so also remember that on December the 24th that is Christmas Eve we will have one service here that's on Sunday at 10:00 no Sunday school we'll have one service I know some people going to be out of town but I it's Sunday we going to have church at least one service okay on Sunday mornings so on December the 24th that's on Christmas Eve we'll have one service here at 10:00 no um we'll have no Sunday school we'll just start at 10: sing some songs and then have a church service also remember on December the 30th 30th brother Eric gu will be here from Honduras church starts at 6:00 that will be on Saturday night December the 31st at 8:00 will be our annual watch Night Service brother Luke Gibson will be with us that night that's December the 31st at 8:00 so we'll keep announcing these things but man it's already down here to the end of the year almost so we thank the Lord for the year though that we've had been trials been tribulations but we're still standing here we still come to church we still read our Bible we still pray I I I thought we're supposed to as the day approaches do more right do more as the day approaches what scripture says and then U we're going to get out of here we're going to get out of here there's a way for us to leave this place other Church ages they didn't have it that door was closed right that door was shut there was no way they could take a Rapture in in other Church ages but in this one there's an open door there's an open book Revelations 4 there was a door open in heaven well that door is open for me and you and that's where we're going we're going to be as brother Ernie vill Anda says we're going to be ejected we're elected to be ejected and uh boy I miss him good grief I miss brother Ernie but uh but he's smiling I bet he's jumping around all over the sixth Dimension and and praising the Lord and we'll see him amen what a great comfort all these just went on that we've even here in our congregation that we'll get to see them amen that's not a hope that's assurity that that will happen so let's let's bow our heads and get started dear heavenly father thank you for this day you've give us thank you for the brothers and sisters that's assembled today Lord and the ones on the internet father we pray that you'd bless them Lord be with the ones that are not here that are sick father I know some are traveling different things Lord I pray that you should be with them be with brother Louise brother uh Aaron going in about a week or so and then also brother Michael being there brother the Christian going just keep them safe and give them fruit for their labor father I pray that you'd be with us here in this service Lord just give us today our daily bread forgive us of our sins and many mistakes that we make against you Lord cleanse us Lord you speak today be the active participant in this service father we ask these things in Jesus name amen so we're here we're on the son of man and we kind of covered it a little bit last night we had like I said we had a really good time with the Hispanic brothers and sisters down there in uh in Lawrenceville and U and we enjoyed being with them and but there's something we've got to do that no other age was required this is a requirement just like adoption is a requirement it's predetermined predestined that we come to adoption so it's also predestined that we take a body change and a Rapture all right this is the end of all things everything's come to this end all right that we believe that all right well then we need to start acting like it we need to quit acting like that me included qu acting like that I'm going to read you something in a few minutes we actually hinder the Holy Spirit H well some of you don't then that's you pray for us to do but we hinder the Holy Spirit the whole down through the church ages the Holy Spirit was hindered it couldn't work completely like it did even Jesus would stand in a place and he was not didn't have the Holy Ghost he was the Holy Ghost and he would have to do what he had to get rid of a group of people because of their unbelief cuz he couldn't work under that unbelief same way with us the same way with brother randam he said look if you got unbelief don't come up here you got to come believing cuz that will hinder the spirit it'll hinder the church service it'll hinder a lot of things if we don't have faith to believe that we're going to get something from God today so in the beginning was the word word was with God and Word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth John 16 Jesus is telling us when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all truth now that's a promise that's a promise that he would lead you and guide you into all truth but now look if you're not looking for truth if truth is presented and you turn it down you have hindered your walk with God you've hindered your the Holy Ghost and he cannot work in your life I'm talking about ours and yours too I'm preaching to all of us today for you shall not speak of himself in other words all that's being now transferred to the bride and who's getting Revelation God's not getting re Revelation brother R told us in the church book God don't get Revelation and never has got Revelation he is the Revelation but he's sending it down to me and you all right so and he will show you things to come or give you further Revelation you may be seated we got to continue on you must be born again because if you're not born again we can't even talk about the things that we're going to talk about and now as we talk about the move and the work of God that we see in in the church and in the different ones that the statue of perfect man is beginning to work we're beginning to see that people are are being able to get more from God to to be more mature and not be crybabies all the time and not be you're always going to have them but but still there's got to be a maturity in a group of people that has to come to Perfection that we don't have to look for it it's here we don't have to go looking for it it's here I don't mean in this building physically I mean in the word of God right all right as long as a word of God is preached that's where you're supposed to be all right cuz that's what we feed on we don't feed on false Doctrine see listen you and it's hard to tell you this but but in Luther's day I've been reading about Martin Luther and John Wesley about their life cuz we're going to do a little bit with the church ages as we get on up to the headstone cuz that was a headstone to the church and the church was Paul arenus Martin Columba all the way up Luther Wesley so I've been reading about Luther and Wesley and you see their lives and you need as brother R always says and the Bible tells us that that they were all they all could come part of the way out of their denomination but couldn't get all the way out right they couldn't get everything in other words the congregation would sit and listen to John Wesley preach about a trinitarian Doctrine well now the Holy Ghost Inside of them wasn't feeding on that that's right he can't feed on false doctr but God let that happen he let he winked it to ignorance of that part and then John Wesley brought sanctification so the life would be there instead of being with Martin Luther where he could drink beer and smoke a pipe and and you know he was a German we say that and we think well that's no that's just everyday life for Germans you know but he didn't have enough to get him all the way out he had enough to get him out of Catholicism but he brought some of that Catholicism with him and also in the denominational World they couldn't get all the way out they leaned back to the mother come on they lean back to the mother they believe the same thing Catholic churches in trinitarian Doctrine false baptism in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost they believe that every denomination except for a few us and different ones I don't call us a denomination but there are some denominations that are Oneness and different ones that baptize in Jesus name but most people have took a piece of that mother and brought it with them I'm sorry right and if we don't have the truth so do we cuz Satan has moved he's not stayed back there he's moved right into this message right that's where he wants to be that's where he can do the most damage that's why brother Ram said oh if Satan could know this seal this seventh seal he could do a lot of damage well you keep it bottled up inside of you he won't get it the seventh seal is you and me folks it's it's Christ revealed in a bride and the Secrets he tells us there's things junee and I talk about and I know you do too you can laugh or roll your eyes if you want to there's things I tell June June and I talk about that would probably make y'all sick but it's me and her we understand each other why can't we be that same way in the gospel where that our husband we'll read this maybe I think tonight we'll talk about a little bit about the the bride being the fullness of the godhead bodily that's because she's mature cuz they couldn't be the fullness of the godhead bily back in the church ages all right right even in this age in the layout of seean age we see it happening the same way so that way we've got to move on a little bit further all right and let God tell our he he's not going to tell a secret to everybody come on people like I said with me and you when there's certain things we say that that you'll never know that's right well now that's not being mean that's because she's my bride amen we married each other to be one to be able to talk about things now why do we marry Jesus Christ to be quiet and keep secrets huh no he's already told us everything we just got to do what he says so you're still what you are until you're born again of the spirit of God we were preaching last night on anointed for for the time and I believe that a lot of what we have maybe not so much yeah Church ages or the denominations and and also in the message we have people that are anointed but not born again cuz we see that people preach this message of the hour for 30 years I'm talking about preachers they spend their life yes their whole life 30 years preaching the message of the hour and then they say it's false because they find something little here and there they never got born again that's right they got an anointing of the hour they got an anointing of the message of the hour and felt good and was able to put things together intellectually well praise God we've not had that here we got a Ministry that's different from [Applause] that yeah cuz our pastor preached being born again 50 years ago and he hadn't stopped so joining church and changing your ideas or having good intentions that's good as it might be is still not right that's right the new birth is an experience in other words something that takes place June and I got married that was something that took place all right we were both there we had an experience of getting married have you ever had an experience with getting married to Jesus Jesus Christ that's my question to you and that brings the new birth we look in the first seal brother Brown then he separates us from the church he takes the church he talks about church church he said I'm going to call you bride now listen that you'll understand yes right cuz that probably probably was a new name to a lot of denominations that he was preaching to he' say the church because remember the church denominational Church preaches that we go through tribulation that we have to stand the white Throne judgment right that's false Doctrine that's right so brother random was preaching to him and he said look that's for the church yes the church goes through tribulation yes the church has to stand judgment but no the bride does not she's being separated she being judged now she's not going to the th white Throne judgment listen what a consolation that should be to every one of us because they're preach listen whatever you preach that's what you are they preach they're going to have to go through the tribulation so guess what they're going through the tribulation they preach they're going to stand before the white Throne judgment brother George they're going to stand before the white Throne judgment if they're not born again every person that's not born again will have to stand before the white Throne judgment but praise God if you get born again here you won't have to worry about it there you've already been judged you've been judged by the judge so never since Jesus Christ on Earth was did Satan have such a formidable opponent he hates this message he hates it he doesn't hate it when it lays on paper brother John he hates it when it's lived he hates it when brothers and sisters get together and talk about the word of God and talk about Revelation and things that God's done in their life he hates that and you watch him every time you put something out there like brother Ram said he says now Secrets I keep in my heart he said but if I ever speak it Satan can get a hold of it and do harm with it think about that Colossians 1 ver8 we're going to get to this and he is the head of the body now look he is the head of what the body the body is the bride the body is the seven Church ages of the of the Born Again Believers in every Church age plus us sitting here today is everybody with me that is the body of Christ he has no physical body here at the moment he does have a body it's over in another dimension all right so he sent the Holy Ghost back into this Dimension to go inside a a bunch of Believers so he can live his way out but he's still the head yes sir we're not the head that's why there had to be positions in the church positions in the in the home husband's the head of the household listen that's that wasn't that way until the fall Adam and Eve were the same person they were co-equal before the fall we always talk about Adam speaking the tree What About Eve before the fall Eve was the same thing as Adam was but because of the fall and what happened there had to be headship but you know what same thing with me and you we didn't come here bride that's right hello somebody we had to be born into that body out of this body into that body which is the body of Christ a many membered body as we're going to talk about this afternoon the collective body of Jesus Christ is the fullness now why was Jesus the fullness of the godhead bodily I'll Point give you this a little bit why was he the fullness of the godhead bodily when he was born when he was born a baby he didn't need the Holy Ghost amen he he was the Holy Ghost he just picked up a flesh body that was created by a what not not a man and a woman but by God spoken word all right placed in the womb she was an oven or an incubator that brought the body of Christ out but when that body was when that baby was born when you breathed your first breath you were dead you're human your first breath you start going downhill now he was in body but his spirit and his soul was God yes that makes him the fullness of the godhead bodily he was all father all son and all holy ghost yes sir but you and I are not because of our first birth but when we get the new birth sir that puts us into that body yes sir that's why we can't be judged the body of Christ has already been judged right it was judged at Calvary sir so God looks at that and he says hey that's his body it's already been judged so he's the head of the body of the church who is the beginning the first firstborn from the dead that in all things that he might have the preeminence there wasn't a time when Jesus Christ was lost there go now listen he grew in Grace and knowledge and favor with man that's what the Bible says because of his Humanity all right he didn't come out of the womb preaching okay but he was but he was not born again either he didn't need a new birth he was born right the first time you and I need a new birth cuz we born in sin shaping in iniquity we came to this world this way but the reason he came was to clean that thing out say hey I'm human you're human we're join ARS right we're join a with Christ that means his flesh we flesh that's why mzc couldn't be your savior now inside of MDC was your savior absolutely but MDC couldn't save you he was just spoken into existence God stepped in the body stepped back out and that thing just went down to dust that's not the way you and I came so we had to be he had to be born the same way we are except for the Virgin birth all right is everybody with me but we're the body then the body's already been judged so everything he's got though we get yes I want us to realize that amen for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell amen he was the fullness of the godhead bodily he was father Son and Holy Ghost brother Brown says complete yes full he now listen he had some bad days as a human I'm sure and as a little boy he might have got spanked he grew in Grace and knowledge right but inside of that the soul was the soul of God the spirit was the spirit of God not another Spirit if he got another Spirit then we got to find that man uh-uh he had the spirit of God the soul of God that's what made him the B of the godhead bodily now listen your spirit realm is not God right now we're working toward it that's why brother Ram say she will be the fullness of the godhead body in a collective around the world group of people not one person brother Ron was not the fullness of the godhead bodily in one person but he could tell us that we are in a collective body all right that by with me Matthew 21 vers verse 42 we'll get to this a little bit later Jesus said did you never read in the scripture the stone which the builders rejected the same has become the head of the corner we know for sure that Jesus knew he would be rejected despised rejected Isaiah 53 right 52 right right but he knew he would come back as the Cornerstone the one down there at the bottom to start his church the way he wanted it started right he couldn't get the he couldn't get a bride in the Old Testament bride had to be born by the spirit of God right spirit of God was not there to be born there was an anointing and it was the anointing of God so much that Moses face would shine they'd have to put a cover over it that's how much God thought of Moses he used a I'm sorry but he used an old man to destroy a nation I mean he literally would went to the White House and said let my people go and when they got finished that whole country all 50 states that we got would be destitute that's right right and they said get out of here that's what happened under the blood of bulls and goats what about now but see me and you are not required to bring a natural group of people cuz we still live in the world this this thing still lives in the world but God told us to separate and come out of right Redemption out of and into all right out of this land into a new land yes sir who took him over though Moses didn't take him over Joshua took him over Moses thy servant is dead but he said Joshua the same as I was with Moses I'll be with you but you have another commission Moses had a commission to bring them out that's right Joshua had a commission to take them into the promised land and positionally place them where they needed to go they listen they that's why God has an order I'm a little bit off the subject here but God's got an order he didn't say okay afim you just wherever y'all you know every how many 25,000 of y'all you just go find you a place and it have been 25,000 people it been like the go Rush going out into California just everybody went now there's a purpose behind God setting every one of those remember brother R said even the mothers that call their name positionally plac them were they're supposed to go in that promised land before they even got there the calling of the name put Ephraim into this and and manasse into this and different ones we know that two tribes and a half trib stayed outside because of to type justification sanctification baptism and the Holy Ghost but there is a group that went in there's a group that went in this is a group that's going in all right we're not going to stay outside we're going in am amen by I love it because Moses told him or Joshua said hey it's okay y'all can have these this land out here but if there's any trouble in this land you're not going to stay out here and go that's your problem no they had to take up arms and go fight that's right that's why your justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost never leaves you that is your fighting force against the devil yes sir praise God that is it that's your fighting force know that you're Justified know that God Justified you not justified yourself come on God Justified you God Sanctified you God filled you with the Holy Ghost those who is Justified he's already glorified when we going to start believing these things amen so the stone which the builders rejected now who's the builders the builders was the Old Testament God was supposed to be built by caias and the different ones cuz he was going to build his body through his church brother brandham said and I believe it and I read it where every one of those Old Testament prophets in that peace built the body of Jesus Christ and he just stepped out on what those denominations said he was coming to them amen he came to his own and his own received him not but those that did receive him he made them to be the Sons and Daughters of Goden so they rejected him but he didn't stop and say well I'm sorry I'm done I'm God but I can't do anything about this no God's going to have a group of people God's got a plan we got to get in the plan we got to be part of the plan and we got to help him we ain't got to help him like we talk about help but he did say he wanted to use your hands your mouth your heart absolutely your voice so the same has become the head of the corner so so so in other words you've knocked me off the top so I'm just going to start down to bottom in a little in a little headstone a corner and I'm going to build my church therefore I say unto you the kingdom of God shall be taken from you that's what he's looking at he's talking to the Pharisees he's talking to the Jews of the day he's saying this is going to be taken away from you and give to a nation remember Jews was a one nation but you and I were a collective group of Nations because we were Gentiles all right and they're going to bring forth the fruit thereof in other words they're going to produce what Jesus was saying I was telling them last night every sermon even this message of the hour came from a three and a half year message of Jesus Christ that's three and a half years three and a half years to go by just like that it has already right but he preached for three and a half years sister Su and that's it I mean did Paul get his message Jesus Christ where Iranians get his message Jesus Christ even where did the Catholics get their message Jesus Christ even the denominations where they get the message well they talk about a man named Jesus but they talk about him back there and he did this and he did that back there they don't have an everpresent God right and whosoever shall fall on this Stone shall be broken but whomsoever it shall fall it will grind I want God to grind me to powder amen gu me the powder Lord cuz he's a master builder he can start with that powder and he can make a mighty powerful church and that's what he's doing now brother R tells us there's been churches churches Brides brides churches Brides brides but there's got to come one Hallelujah there has to come a real bride now that doesn't mean I'm going to read this I think I got it a little bit later the the Bible talks about a faithful and true witness now not that that witness was ever false all right so he's not brother R's not saying that all the the brides were false cuz he says right here there has to come a real bride no a real bride that has a commission that real bride that's going to take the end time message and go to the body chains and go to the Rapture and bring all the other ones out of the Grave that's the real bride and listen that's what God's been looking for yes Revelations 3:14 the beginning of the creation of God that's you and me we know it was Jesus Christ but who are we we're M Jesus Christ and what must come one has got mechanics and Dynamics makes the church live move in the power of his resurrection until we come to that place why is it good to polish the hubs why is it good to wear long hair and long dresses if you don't live if you don't live it all the time and it become a revelation to you not that you just do it because somebody says hallu it becomes a revelation Jun doesn't have to get up every morning and fight herself to go get her hair cut if you're born again a holy ghost filled woman won't ever cut her hair right Revelations 19:5 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready and to her was Grant look to her was granted from who her husband the head that she should be a raid and fine linen in other words no piece uncovered AR raid and fine linen and you're not going to walk up and be clean and white and have one little spot right here or a little spot right here or little spot down here God's not that way you might be that way and I might be that way but when God cleans you up he don't leave a spot he don't leave a wrinkle you know what the Bible says without spot or wrinkle when we going start believing that we shall be ar raay and fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of his body we're the Saints all right remember we were talking about this the the your bride is on your wedding day I'm going to get married this is my bride or this is my new bride but she should become your wife this is my wife June Dale this is my wife she was my bride on wedding day she was my bride maybe my Young Bride in the beginning and you might want to call her bride that's okay but she knows she's your bride she was there at the wedding all right I hope but now she's your wife she understands you look now what is a wife to do a wife is to what Express the husband aren't we supposed to express the Lord Jesus that's all listen the bride's not to be somebody that's over here that does their own thing no like the world does and becomes the head and becomes the this and that and the other everybody understand me remember this is a woman's Nation this is a woman's everything coming to a woman a woman is what's killing all of the the world the Greek lexican says look a wife is come to pass be done arise be fulfilled remember brother R talked about an unfulfilled age well that wasn't the right bride it wasn't the true bride it was a bride but it wasn't all true because they had false Doctrine be married to or look be preferred why were you not born in another age why were you you that have the Holy Ghost why weren't you born some other time cuz God controls every bit of that there's no one person that says I got here because I wanted to and I I was born January 26 1960 no by the way betting ground brother R said he took this one to this one and married this one this one and this one this one and got you here so you can make a choice but he knew once you once you got here what you do yes sir we just don't but brother George he put us in this age he didn't put us in Martin Luther's day he didn't put us in John Wesley listen he didn't put us here in the 50s some of you might have been born in in in 40s but he put you here to do something today yes sir today is the day of salvation we love the day we got married the day we he said you're my bride the boat board came up and took the bride but he didn't take her and leave her and and go off he took her back to Chicago he took us on a journey listen here just a minute I want to kind of reject this the Bible tells us that that God gave us a help meat brother Dale has preached on this many many times he didn't give us a help mate read your Bible if you got your Bible read it does not say help mate it says a help meat which is the same somebody to help you or enhance you not make you worse or weak God didn't have a bride to make him weak he had a bride to become a wife to make him strong and be the opponent of the devil that he's always looked for yes Satan says I did it through a woman God says I'm going to do it through one too we're all feminist in the body right sat said oh I got herur she's weak he said no you may have got her but that second Eve she ain't going to fall I'm going to use that same character yes the woman so it's a help me or as join HS in Romans 8 tells us we're join HS with Jesus Christ I hope you see that I got this off the internet it must be true sounded good anyway when you grow old who will take care of you for many that caretaker will be a spouse I'm getting to something here because look even the even the com even people tell us I'll read it here that marriage is one of the most important things you do do you know if you stay single according to the all the Lord we got so much um uh information now they can tell you how many this and how many of that and put it on a graph and put it on the chart and pull it up on the internet if you don't get married until you're like 35 or 40 you have a five year less life expectancy than ones that get married and Men we go first I'll read it but can't you see it yourself but does marriage actually improve life expectancy here's what the research shows marriage was one of the first nonbiological factors now a biological factor would mean that you have a heart issue or you have diabetes or you have some some some something that will cut your life short so this is nonbiological this is has nothing to do with your health marriage was one of the first non-biological factors identified as improving life expectancy I say praise God if you're married to Christ your life expectancy just went way up amen the explanation given was that married people tend to take fewer risk with their health and have better mental and emotional health sometimes we think that's the opposite I'm not preaching on marriage today but got to talk about a little bit marriage also provides more social and material support now think of think in the spiritual what Jesus Christ gives us in support if you're the bride amen y'all ought to sleep late on Saturday night you're not stay out so much you falling asleep already well you wouldn't fall asleep for as a ball game going on marriage also provides more social and material support look which means having someone to take care take you to the doctor the great physician or care for you when you're sick it can save your life married people live longer and healthier lives the power of marriage is particularly evident in late middle age well praise God that got a lot of us I think June and I are in the late part of the middle age that's what he says the late part the power of marriage is particularly evident in late middle age when Linda we and a colleague for example analyzed mortality differentials in a very I want you to think spiritual with me too now this is what Jesus Christ has married us to do for us to enhance us not to not to beat us make us doormats hello somebody amen thank God he doesn't do that a very large nationally representative sample they found an astonishingly large marriage Gap in longevity nine out of 10 married guys now listen to this guys nine out of 10 married guys who are alive at 48 will make it to age 65 90% nine out of 10 of you married guys I'm heading toward that I won't be I'll be there in just year and a half or year and two months oh 64 coming up but if you're alive at 48 if you made it to 48 then you got a 90% chance of making it to 65 compared to just six and 10 you say that ain't much yeah it is when he talking about me and you when you talk about our life okay just six and 10 comparable single guys controlling for race education income for women the protective benefit of marriage are also powerful though not quite as large nine out of 10 wives alive at 48 will live to be senior citizens compared with just eight out of 10 divorced and single women in fact according to statistic statistician Bernard Cohen and iing Lee I sing Lee maybe I don't know that's maybe an acronym who compiled a catalog of relative mortality risk look being unmarried is one of the greatest risks that people voluntarily subject himself to being unmarried is one of the great now iing Lee said this being unmarried is one of the greatest risk that people voluntarily subject themselves to having heart disease for example reduces a man's life expectancy by just under six years while being unmarried chops 10 years off your life H this is not just a selection effect even controlling for initial health status sick people who are married live longer than their unmarried counterpart I hope you think a little bit spiritual L right having a spouse for example example lowers a cancer patient risk of dying from the disease as much as being in an age category 10 years younger a recent study of outcomes for surgical patients found that just being married lowered a patient's risk of dying in a hospital praise God scientists who have studied immune functioning in the laboratory find that happily married couples have better functioning immune systems praise God I believe that cuz we believe in prayer and we believe in faith from our husband divorced people even years after the divorce show much lower levels of immune functions I just thought you might want to read that that's what God did for us when you marry Christ it's not just a marriage and you go well no there's things there's benefits and I know there's benefits to being married naturally but we're talking spiritually here yes cuz listen all you the Single Wives and single men and all people are not married that's not we're not kicking you out because Christ is your husband until you get one on earth Christ is your husband and and vice versa cuz he is our husband I don't care we're all feminist in the body of Christ that's why I said we all come under that feminist part but God's going to use that feminist part to defeat the Devil with sir Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing of sun of Soul and Spirit and the join marrow and the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and we we pulled apart the other day the soul that's the real you that's the person that you are that's the person that's going to stand before the white Throne judgment if you're not judged here because remember if your soul is born again that soul is God that's right and God can't be judged right he is the judge that's why that he's given us the part of being a judge cuz we can judge we're not you listen you're not even supposed to take a brother to court you're supposed to judge it right here well get quiet if you want to but that's what he said and you can also save on some real big lawyer fees right Bob Bob said yep it's an exorbitant amount of money people spend on law just having lawyers our little city of Gillsville population 300 when the cows are on this side of the fence we pay our lawyer $110,000 a year just as a retainer now we get a few little thing you know that gives us so many minutes on the phone and he comes to a meet in the year and we get this and then it becomes billable hours so when you talk to them on the phone you better get say don't say hey how you doing David no it's like hey I need this right here okay you give me answer see you bye cuz it's $300 an hour after that so woe unto you lawyers that's telling you what Jesus said that's what he said not people that work for him but I know Bob sees a lot of that it is it is a it's an odd um when you have to when you try to believe somebody that you know's guilty and you try to make them innocent and you know in your mind they guilty and you try to take them before a jury and convince them or at least one of them that it might not be that way I don't think I could live that way anyway so the spirit realm is the realm that we're talking about now this is the this is where the battlegr is this is to me this is the messy part because you know what a a birth is a mess but once you clean the baby up he pretty smelly good and all the all the baby oil and all the I you love baby shampoo I wish they' make something for me for that smell like baby shampoo I love that stuff and it don't get tears in your eyes I wonder why we don't have that well praise the Lord anyway life lesson number 743 but after you're cleaned up you're not a mess anymore you're your soul is clean just as Eternal as God is it's not just Eternal as God is it is God all right but our spirit realm is where the nasty smudy mire of the world and it's not on this guy right here this guy just produces what's inside he's just a vehicle to get Express what you've got like my hands Express what you got inside of you but my memory is not your memory my reasoning is not your reason I have my own all right but God said he would work on that through these virtues he would work on that part of you because your soul is already Eternal your soul is already sit in Heavenly places your soul is already God Almighty and coming to the fullness of the godhead body and the collective group yes all right but we've got to come to Perfection as we'll see here in just a few minutes the whole Bible talks about growth absolutely from Genesis to Revelation talks about growth Ephesians 1:4 says having predestinated us into the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will so there's a group that's going to come to adoption that's going to come to birth going to come to adoption and we're going to take that adoption and use it as brother R says here in a few minutes where you won't pray for people you speak to people now listen lay it on them hands you can't take it out of the Bible some people need that I don't need that some people need that to feel that connection and that's fine and Dy because it's in the Bible you can't take it out but when are we going to come to where you say you say you say to your sickness you say to your wayward child or your wayward husband you say to them be moved and not down in your heart we are predestinated unto adoption so remember we talked about adoption is second Peter for if these things be in you and abound in other words if these things be in you and work they're going to make you where you're not Barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lath these things is blind even though you're a Christian even though you're born again cuz born again come up here in verse 1 2 three and four having the divine nature of God listen you can have the divine nature of God and be blind right have you not been sitting there and thought one thing and all of a sudden a preacher say something you go man I didn't think that was that well you were blind to it ex we were blind rich and miserable and naked the whole problem is with the world they don't know it you and I know when we're blind cuz we seek Revelation Lord help me with that yes help me with this that Minister saying take a little note and study it you don't have to you can't take a note on the whole subject but something will strike your heart like I got a question about that write it down and go study it amen St it for yourself but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see a far off in other words can't see further Revelation and hath forgotten have we forgotten in all this long journey that we're have we forgotten what God's brought us through that he purged us from our old sins and we don't need to worry about them anymore hello somebody put them in the sea of God's forgetfulness he don't remember them but you do but you know what it's not you that did it you listen the holy ghost in your body the Holy Ghost inside of you never will sin that's right that's the Paradox or the Paradigm or whatever you want to call it you got something Eternal inside of you yet you're dying you got something Eternal inside of you yet you have questions yet you get sick that's what happened when the fall happened that's why it was so bad that God said hey I'm going to put a Vision I'm not going to even be able to look at you until I come and clean this thing up yes am then we can have fellowship and there still brother Brown said he hears your voice I was telling him last night you know I go hunting and and go to Philippines for three three weeks or so man you know when I come back I don't want to see brother collie who do you want to see you want to see your bride or your wife that's who you want to see right listen Jesus Christ has not literally put his eyes on the bride yet think about it he's not here in a corporate body so his physical eyes has never seen the bride amen but in spirit form he's seen every one of us yes sir think about that but you know what I can call June up we can talk and we can just smooch for for a few minutes on the phone you hang a phone up and you know what she ain't knowwhere to be found you're you're you're you're you know 3,000 miles over here in the Philippines but I want to get back home so we can face to face see each other talk to each other have communion together with each other well that's what Jesus Christ is he's waiting on us in that other di listen he was in that Dimension and brother Ram couldn't see him right people in the sixth Dimension are not even privileged to see that body yet right but he's transferred all that power to this body for the moment yes to defeat the Devil with this body and then bring his body in the Millennium down here on Earth but we go to a wedding supper when we take a body change we get a glorified body this body changed then we can meet him in the air then we can meet our lover we can meet our husband somebody that we know that we felt him we've seen his work we've seen his work in our life but you've never physically seen Jesus Christ but we're going to see him we're going to look Face to Face Paul said one time we're going to see that person that we know is inside of us by the Holy Ghost but he is a person yes he is someone we want to touch he is someone we want to hug I don't know about you but to me that's a love affair all right you can have longdistance relationships all you want to but that's not very fulfill will wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure if if you do these things you shall never fall that's pretty powerful for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in other words there's going to be a door open in the end time through a little Prophet that comes and tells they say hey let's talk about this y'all talked about the new birth for for seven Church ages or 20 th years but we're going to talk about this adoption which never was taken out Paul talks about it but never attained to it you got to attain to it in the end time we have been what predestinated to adoption all right for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly in the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance this is Peter and I'm sorry but if you read this right here he must have preached this same sermon about 20 times maybe 30 times wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present day truth he goes and visits the church and they're like he going to preach on them virtues again well he going to come back three months he going to pre we know pet we know Peter going to say something about their virtues all right but let's have we made it have we is it common is it so common that we we saw all ask brother waade he's reading the same scripture again and he's got 138 sermons on this one subject and had him got to the real subject of the son of man now we look where Jesus he's walked at he's about three years into his ministry he has about 6 months left of his life he goes up a mountain and he's covered and overshadowed with a cloud and a voice comes out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son and whom I pleased to dwell hear ye him all right hear ye him now brother Brown's going to tell us in a few minutes hear ye them he didn't change the word cuz there was the bride inside of Jesus the whole time Jesus walked on the earth you and I were inside of him that's why we can understand Jesus Christ better than anybody cuz that piece of you was inside of of that man that eternal life that Genesis 126 man came right down and went ENT that in that baby and walked through life I know some of you may have been on the shores of Galilee I don't know my mom and dad were I think but if anybody ever been to Israel and walk the shores of Galilee you should have all raised your hand you're not getting it amen you were there where were you in his soul you were that part of him that was longing to get out so he could commune with he he didn't mind communing back before the foundation the world in his mind and all that you know that we talk about but he doesn't want that I you know when you talk about your wife you think M you got all these different things and your husband in your mind you know I want that to develop into a person so I can talk to them I want to have a relations with him I want to I want to be somebody I can you know like brother Brown said that boy said he wants god with skin on him I want god with scan on him then hear you him we talk about the son was adopted his name's good on the checkbook just as good as his daddy's now he didn't get the checkbook at first he did get a checkbook but it had Jesus's name written on it cuz he really don't trust you with his money yet just like you wouldn't with a fivey old or a sixy old or 10y old driving you home in your car today Sophia drive your Mom and Daddy home today okay that makes us all nervous and we a even going to be in the car with him well that's the way God is he's not nervous but he knows you can't handle certain things that's he knows that you'll mess up a situation he knew that remember he told Brother R he said you're messing up remember the angel told him you're messing up quit quit trying to explain everything oh boy you get quiet when you start talking about a prophet making a mistake sorry about that but it did so that's where God's trying to get his church just say the mountain be moved and it'll move Authority sons of God the whole creation groaning waiting Romans 8 waiting for a spot to where that the sickness will be arise and it will be that way the blind will receive their sight deaf and dumb we pray for them now but then you'll command it now how many believe brother R was a prophet we believe that is going to happen or are we just going to keep reading it didn't say these signs shall follow them that believe they shall pray for the SI sick it said they shall cast out devils not I will they will if you say this mountain not if I say if you say this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart what we need is adoption Sons and Daughters needs adoption but how can the church look the Pentecostal Church the Methodist Baptist be adopted until they come to discipline we've got to be disciplined first you know what discipline is right it's a set of rules that you go by right we lovingly go by by the rules that God give us all right but there's a set of rules that you go by in discipline all right so let me give you an example we are disciplined Christians because we don't smoke or drink and we know not to do these things we know not to curse we know not to you know wear men's clothes we know that right okay we know that we are disciplined though by the word of God but now what about them out there he's talking about Methodist Baptist they go to church with pants on shorts on saw a guy the other day walk in church with a pair of shorts on disrespectful there's no discipline right they just don't care you tell them oh you ain't supposed to do these things well I ain't perfect you ain't perfect well see they don't care they don't take headship they don't take discipline they don't take no headship that's right so God could not trust this power with the church but I say he is going to trust it with the bride amen it's hard to tell what you would do what the Pentecostals do they shouted it brother Brown said they blew it out the whistle they just have all these great uh manifestations and speaking in tongues and and never even get the word out well the word's got to be first to begin with CU they don't have enough discipline to put the word first we should know and have discipline to know how to do these things all right so it's discipline and those dis discipline is what those virtues now let's look at this real quick and then we'll close right here didn't get very far but we'll get far A little bit this afternoon Isaiah 53:2 now the Bible tells us about growth and that's what adoption is adopting is purely growth it's growth development through the word of God not not eating pie or whatever we had for Thanksgiving look who is this he in Isaiah 53 it's Jesus Christ amen for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant as a root out of dry ground he hath no form or cess and when we shall see him there's no beauty that we should desire him Zechariah 6:12 and speak unto the Lord saying thus speaketh the Lord of host saying behold the man whose name is the branch now who is that Jesus Christ and he shall grow up out of his place and he shall build not with hammer and nails he shall build the temple Temple of the Lord Malachi 4:2 says but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and you shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall that's right before Malachi 45 Ephesians 4:14 that will henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of men and cunning crack whereby they lie and weight to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ Romans 8:21 because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to Wi or to witness or to understand the Redemption of our body listen even the great Apostle Paul spoke of it he could see it in part but he couldn't see in his fullness but the Bible that he wrote 80% of the New Testament is where we're going to get all that out of you see he was blinded because you say blinded yes he was blinded to that truth because he didn't get the seals he didn't get the open door like we did come on I'm sorry some of you looking at like it did last night some of them look I told I said when you get that big old fur on in the front of your face like that that means you ain't understanding it or you don't believe it one of the two you go it was a brother sitting on the front row and I said something and he we express everything that we he we are inside you can't hide it we really don't need discernment like brother brandham that was for them has enough discernment looking at people's faces especially them that go wherefore the law was our school Master to bring us to Christ so there was a there was a law right the law of dos and don'ts even Jesus came under that law of dos and don'ts amen he would do something he say go do the law of Moses he' do something he'd say go see the priest cuz a leper remember a leper had to take his body to a priest and they had to check him over if there was no spots or it was yellow I mean white they were good well Jesus didn't say well bless God forget about them people no he grew up under the law you and I when we're born again and we are the Bride of Jesus Christ when we are babies we're laws we're lawyers that's right I don't do that no more why are they still doing it we become lawyers we become the law but that law was part of our growth development but it brought us to Christ amen that's right it brought us to Christ that we might be justified by faith yes I'm GNA burn some of you hide but here we go you ready take yourself what's a school Master School Master tells you says Hey 1+ 1 is two 2 plus 2 is 4 4 plus 4 is eight right there a school Master you have to go to school you have to go to school and learn these things so there's a law there that brings you to Christ but listen when you got into second and third grade everybody with me when you get in second and third grade that teacher don't have to go back over 1 plus one is two now maybe the second grade did but when when I got in calculus in college there was no mention of 1 plus one is too because you know what it was inside of me it was a it was something I inherited from that first grade teacher I needed that first grade teacher so why we have to beg people to come to church why we have to beg people to be on time we don't believe what God Said you're supposed to be here 20 minutes before the service starts pray and read your Bible some of y'all walk in when Bob's talking some of you walk in this and some of you you shouldn't do that there's an order there's an order to everything and the Holy Spirit loves that order and if you're out of that order you bind him you bind the Holy Ghost brother Mar said one unconfessed sin we need to pray one unconfessed sin can make a whole church fail whole church cuz you bound the holy spirit so like I said before I don't have to go back to the first grade to remember I need to be here 20 minutes before service starts to remember I need to read my Bible to remember I need to stud remember I need to come to church that ought to be inherent inside of you and just be like your everyday movement all right if you got a job I mean Dad worked on assembly line for almost 30 years well his job he didn't have to come in after 20 years brother George unless they moved him to another job he didn't have to come in and go I might to figure this out again I I don't know what in the world after you do it for 20 years you ought to be able to be common to you you ought to be able to get your tail up and come to church right and not have to be told it should be inherent inside of us cuz we fall if we don't you said it's just some if I'm five minutes that ain't you to say that's right right it's a prophet of God said 20 minutes for service he meant something by that oh that was just brother Brandon well now when who who decided you were going to decide what was God and what was not go get here on time all right get here before time but after that faith has come we are no longer under a school master words we don't need to be taught that again but we do for we are all the children of God in faith in Christ Jesus let's continue on just for a second and we'll close right here the heir as long as he's a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all though though we have everything when we become the Bride of Jesus Christ when we become born again you get everything you need for your journey so just lay down and just take a nap and just take a nap for the rest of your journey and just you'll be the best CR no you'll die that's right take that baby beautiful it is put it in that room shut the door about two weeks later you going you going to have a dead child same way in Christianity that's right that's why you need to come to church you need to feed on the word of God for I say that the heir as long as he's a child differ nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but is under tutors and governors what the word of God preach is like brother Bob was talking about preach to a group of people a fivefold Ministry and also others that can help can help you through these things but look but when the fullness of time was come God sent his son he didn't have to keep talking about it he's here wherefore there are no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ and then we talking about at Bar Mitzvah which they do over in in Israel they have a ritual when you come to your 13th birthday which means that you have learned from many tutors and many Governors and now listen every child that turns 13 years old doesn't go through a bar mitzvah it's if you come to the requirements of your tutor that you go to that all right because the boy is now deemed personally responsible for fulfilling all the Commandments May hfor henceforth D pharies which is symbols and what those things they wear on their forehead and they wear on their arm and all that stuff during the weekly morning prayer and may be counted as an adult whenever 10 male adults are needed to form a quorum for a public prayer very important to come to adoption even in the natural sense now I want to read this let's stand to our feet come on musicians I highlighted this year because this is 1953 all right that's what 70 years ago this year 70 years ago this is what our Prophet was preaching across the river they went say what will you ask I wish we'd have time to take up before the law of adoption Pentecost was born that's right like the son but that same son was born in a family had to be adopted also that's right and there's where you missed your calling friend when the adoption time come if the tutor that raised the child find the finds the child not worthy they absolutely still remained a son but missed their adoption but if they were adopted into the family they were full Fellowship any check they wrote was good as one of the day wrote that's what's the matter today brother the church ought to be an adoption right now 1953 70 years from this year the church ought to be in adoption right now bringing into the full favors of God but the thing we up and down and in and out up and down and in and out to God can't trust us with nothing hardly all right 1959 let's get on a little bit further closer to our age some of us weren't even born in 1959 what the Holy Ghost was given for what watch what he says what is it he's pouring in his Spirit then those who are resting out you under in the grave or under the altar of God as the scripture says are crying how long Lord how long how much longer God's waiting on me and you the church is waiting on me and you adoption time when God can pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection that when the church and Christ become so close together till Christ becomes visible Among Us in a bride and raises the dead and we go in Rapture we'll stop right here we'll pick it up this afternoon and I wrot wrote myself a note false Doctrine hinders the Holy Spirit our unconfessed sins are the things that we do we should be the most repentant people in the world God I'm sorry I did that cuz Christians are the only ones that have sins brother Ram said right hello sins because we sin every day but we have an advocate did you say father I didn't mean to do that I really didn't now listen if you didn't get convicted for it you need to be in the altar do y'all not get maybe I need to preach to somebody else do youall not get convicted every day about something every day every single day you go Lord I should have never done that or why did I do that even the very thoughts in my mind I say Lord where did I come from why but listen he's not in that part he's here we got to remember that so anyway false Doctrine hinders the holy spirit that mine and yours all right false Doctrine you say I don't have any false Doctrine yeah we all have F all of us do until the fullness of time has come we'll redirect we'll start right there this afternoon but God bless you love you with the love of the Lord we thank you for uh I thank you for even coming to this church I really enjoy being around you your your friends and and uh family and I sure appreciate it appreciate you effort listen I know it's an effort to come to church I know it's an effort to put your clothes on I know it's an effort to get up out of the bed some of you drive a hour hour and a half to get here I appreciate that but you know what God appreciates it more than I do but my Heavens when if you live an hour and a half like sister Trudy she live listen some of y'all that don't know this sister Trudy hold your hand up honey hold your hand up she's close to 49 years old almost twice 80 what 65 oh okay she's 65 I think maybe she means 85 but listen she's going to stand one day in judgment yes sir even the little judgment she's going to stand in front of us that can't make it to church and live 15 miles away she drove four hours never missed a Sunday unless she was real sick she wore out a Volvo 300 and something thousand miles before it kind of went well things wear out cuz it's human stuff you know she did it without her husband coming she did it alone for four hours you and I get home we go 10 minutes down the road we kick our shoes off we're already eating supper at laa we're already back home and sister Trudy ain't even made it past Georgia hardly yet and she still got I mean South Carolina yet cuz she's got to go to Charlotte North Car Carolina for how many years it's been they moved in Dawsonville now she's got 45 minutes so she's still condemning a lot of us but four hours for years not just oh well I I well I don't know if I want to do this anymore she had a fervor she'd come here and she'd do tapes before people would get here when we were doing um you know running tapes off she'd run tapes she' help out all she could four hours we ought to be ashamed you got to get the Holy Ghost that's right amen but there's Witnesses see there's Witnesses everywhere I don't have the same Faith as maybe a brother has I got a problem I should have the fa same Faith he does so I'm going to judge myself for that there's a problem somewhere maybe same way with all of us we all got I mean try she's stand back there with her head down she don't want to be recognized but but God help us there's a witness in everything there's a witness there and when you come up with an excuse and go like it um your sister that lived with y'all for 20 something years down there at Lula she drove four hours in the morning that means listen you and I can get up some of y'all that don't get here on time can get up at 9:30 would you already be here by then and just wobble on to church she had to get up at she had to leave at 5:00 in the morning to drive four hours to get here at 9:00 5:00 in the morning and like I said when she go when she'd take off and go home we'd go out and eat we'd go sit down and eat and we'd fellowship and we'd go home and we'd be in our jammies and she'd just barely be getting home what's wrong with us she had the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost was driving her to the word of God right cuz that she passed probably 50 message churches one or two that was not far from your house where she used to go she used to go to another church way back when she could have just easily said I think I'll just go over here no she wanted to hear something she wanted to hear the word of God like it had never been preached before that's what she saw in brother Dale she saw a message righteous truy that that she had never heard before and she wanted to hear some more and at that time there was no internet like that when she first started so she had to come to church or she got it on a cassette tape and she didn't like to listen three or four days or or three or four weeks down the road she wanted to listen to it fresh so she came to church God help us all all of our excuses there is none in the gospel there's no excuses you'll get up and you won't miss a doctor's appointment by 30 minutes I'll promise you that will you cuz it cost you money hey maybe we start never heard of a church having a late fee but we can always start one if you're late you put more in a offing plate I'm just kidding but we should be here and try our best to never hinder a service try our best never when somebody comes up for prayer I've told you many times before I don't pray for that person the anointing is on the preacher that person has a need I don't have to know it I ain't got to stick my ear in it but when brother Dale would pray for him You' see me over there rais my hand I said God forgive me at this moment take anything out of my life that'll hinder the Holy Ghost to helping those people because brother rown said that does happen and that would happen you can hinder the Holy Ghost because of your unconfessed sin or my unconfessed sin so I want to make sure that on the day of judgment our judgment now not listen not Judgment of of whether you get eternal life or not I'm talking about the Jud Judgment of Deeds Done in the body whether good or bad we are going to have to go to a minor judgment because we do get crowns and we do get all these different things positions but I don't want him to God to say hey now brother Wade said sister Trudy come up here for prayer she really was sick and you cut that guy off and you said a word you weren't supposed to I'm just making an example and you hindered her from getting healed I don't want that I don't want that on my account there's a lot of things going to be my account but I hope that one thing is I don't want to be a hindrance to anybody to get healed or get delivered I want people delivered listen we this is a delivering message from anything that you got all right let's sing one let's just sing a verse it's 12:00 sorry oh greater is he that is in Me Greater is he that is in Meer is is okay okay all right hang hang on man sister Susan wants to um ask to the congregation something first off I want to say I'm glad to be back yeah glad to have you back prayers for my mom and for me right now I need prayer for Cindy um she's in a nursing home an hour away and I took I I got her for Thanksgiving she's not doing good she's lost weight and she's real feeble um and I just don't think she's being taken care of and I've neglected her taking care of my mom I want to be able to take better care of her I made a commitment to her to take care of her and I feel like I've let her down because she looks really bad and I mean her toenails had not even been trimmed in a year wow because I haven't seen her in a year yeah so I I need her close I need her in Commerce Maybe where brother Dale was um I need I'm going to need financial assistance from the government in order to do that so I need you know I just need prayer that that we can get this accomplished and get it accomplished soon because I Cindy's you know she she'll be 77 years old tomorrow wow and she looks my mother at 91 looked healthier than Cindy wow so I just need I need everybody to join with me and pray for Cindy that I can get her close enough that I can take care of her on a regular basis and not have to travel an hour one way and an hour back and maybe bring her to church sometimes am you know but if y'all will just pray with me pray for me yes pray for her amen thank you for those of you'all that don't know who candy is candy come to church here a long time ago and she's Donnie's cousin brother Donnie F Bush's cousin and uh devil just give me a blinding headache but anyway we're good um she came in church I'm just going to say this she was on drugs I mean prescription pills she she was so nervous she couldn't exist without them she walk in that door she sit down right there and she sat there I know I'm going along but sorry you can eat a little bit later she sat right there you know brother Dale preaching and she's got I mean her hair has died black she's got on lipstick y'all y'all that know her we saw her all right had on lipstick cuz nobody ever T her she would just coming up she needed help she needed prayer because there was demons screaming at her she needed help when now brother Dell didn't say now bless God sister don't you come back in here she came to church about three months brother John with pants on makeup big old earbobs look like fishing lures right you remember we all remember that now most churches would have beat her from the first sermon to the last one but thank God we had a a messenger yes that could preach the Holy Ghost Inside of somebody without killing them physically so brother Dell just kept preaching we never had to go take her back in the study and say hey you need to quit doing that about 3 or 4 months after that Cindy comes in with no makeup on Cindy comes in with natural hair Cindy comes in with the dress on just you see the transformation right in front of you without having to beat her with a stick right and then she quit taking pills I mean she may had to have some to get by but it wasn't like when the first time she walked in here I mean she was like a drug addict almost right I'm not telling lie right not exaggerating she was out of that she was out of it come back to her sense she come here she said I want the Holy Ghost so bad I've wasted part of my life I want the Holy Ghost so bad we had prayer with her and I believe she got it in her own little simple way I believe she did cuz she Ste kept coming to church she kept reading her Bible sure well my Lord there things in your past you got to try to get rid of listen this is a an instant gospel but I think it takes time am for us to grow into being a wife yeah and I think Sandy we watched her grow and she was older though her her time was was limited she'd be her body up really I mean she'd wore her body out with all the taking the pills and stuff nervous always nervous about something she calmed down she was just as calm afterwards and I mean brother John totally different person transformed right in front of our eyes so she got sick she they'd be put in a nursing home so I bet you she'd love to be back here we know our bodies wear out you look at brother Dale different one their bodies just wear out and it can't do what it used to do but there's still a soul inside of there that wants to do something that wants to serve the Lord and that desire is still there doesn't matter you 77 tell her happy birthday by the way but we we desire to see her back here amen I told Dad a couple days ago we stayed with him Friday night didn't get a whole lot of sleep about an hour but but I told him I said D I want you back in church right I want you back here yes I want to see you back here he just shook his head but there's still a there's still a holy ghost fi preacher inside there right inside that shell that the devil's tried to play with but talk to him like that tell Cindy tell Cindy we still she knows we love her there's no doubt she or she done left but we didn't beat her to death she just she just morphed right into from that caterpillar to the butterfly right and brother John we didn't have to like I said you didn't have to pay her you didn't have all caterpillar's got to do is what eat get in the right environment and eat and there's a butterfly in there and it'll come out yes amen praise
