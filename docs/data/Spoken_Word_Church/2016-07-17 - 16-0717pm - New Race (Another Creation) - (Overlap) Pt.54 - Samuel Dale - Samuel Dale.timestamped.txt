[14:47] that you've allowed us to be able to
[14:49] receive and we need you so much because
[14:52] we know and realize that there's nothing
[14:54] with our within ourselves that could
[14:57] make anything but we rest in you and we
[14:59] ask you to come down speak to our hearts
[15:01] and our lives and Lord just forgive our
[15:04] sins and lead us and teach us thy ways
[15:07] that we may walk there in Lord we know
[15:10] and realize there's many sicknesses
[15:12] Among Us and many afflictions and you

[15:17] we believe you and we thank you guide
[15:19] each and every one Just Have Your Way
[15:21] forgive our sins cleanse us from all
[15:24] unrighteousness and keep us in Jesus
[15:27] name amen
[15:30] Revelations
[15:35] 3:14 and unto the angel of the Church of
[15:38] the lady of andr these things sayth the
[15:40] amen the faithful and true witness the
[15:43] beginning of the creation of God all
[15:46] right we're going back to Malachi
[15:49] because remember what we said as it
[15:52] starts in Malachi 4
[15:54] verse4 he tie together the entire Old
[15:58] Testament
[15:59] coming up and that's why he would say
[16:01] remember ye the law of Moses my servant
[16:04] see because that's who the word come to
[16:06] that's the whole Old
[16:08] Testament is proof of one thing from the
[16:12] old Old Testament look what is to do and
[16:15] it stands and looks forward to see the
[16:19] entire journey of
[16:22] mankind and it tells you how it's going
[16:24] to take place so remember ye the law of
[16:26] Moses my servant which I commanded unto
[16:28] him and wh for all Israel with the
[16:31] statutes and judgments now watch behold
[16:33] I send you Elijah the prophet before the
[16:36] coming of the great and Dreadful day of
[16:37] the Lord and he shall turn the heart of
[16:40] now notice not Hearts turn the heart
[16:44] there's one heart there all
[16:46] right heart of the fathers to the
[16:49] children that was the Old Testament
[16:51] Saints to the New Testament message and
[16:54] bringing Calvary and bringing in the New
[16:56] Testament the kingdom all right right
[16:59] and then there's to be an end time to
[17:01] happen to what and the Heart of the
[17:05] children babes in
[17:08] Christ you remember we're still on the
[17:10] statute of perfect man remember we're
[17:12] still on Peter add to your
[17:15] faith see virtue all right so then we're
[17:19] still back with that same thought now
[17:21] and the Heart of the
[17:23] children it doesn't call them fathers
[17:25] that right because it's not in the end
[17:28] time what is to do take the children and
[17:30] turn them back okay take babies in
[17:33] Christ cuz you're not born again as
[17:36] adults you're born again as babies in
[17:39] Christ all right and to turn the heart
[17:41] of the children to their fathers lest I
[17:44] come and smite the Earth with a curse
[17:46] you may be seated the Lord at his
[17:48] Blessing you understand why we're using
[17:51] those things that to
[17:54] me you know to me the entire Bible ties
[17:58] together and makes a beautiful picture
[18:02] that no matter what you're at or the
[18:03] point you're thinking about they like I
[18:06] said why would he come all the way
[18:07] through and then summing it up and say
[18:10] Remember You The Law of
[18:14] Moses then makes his
[18:16] statement of the future coming see and
[18:19] wants to take place and showing you all
[18:22] the way through the complete Plan of
[18:25] Salvation to mankind to bring it from
[18:28] the the B the point of the book of Acts
[18:31] and the children and in the Old
[18:33] Testament people
[18:35] turned to the New Testament message all
[18:38] right now is to take those children that
[18:41] we are because we're not born again as
[18:43] adults right right we're born again at
[18:47] Faith starting our journey and now turn
[18:50] our hearts
[18:52] back to the original father's message
[18:55] which would cover then the entire B
[18:59] Bible because it would cover then as we
[19:01] were talking this morning that what did
[19:04] the prophet do he came not as he said he
[19:08] it's not in the beginning of his
[19:10] ministry but in the winding down when he
[19:13] begin to declare his message see now
[19:16] that message has come forth to you and I
[19:20] and that way it will turn our hearts
[19:23] back and what did he say on 327 of the
[19:27] church age book this messenger of
[19:28] Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 will do two things
[19:32] turn the hearts of the children back to
[19:35] the fathers you know the seven the the
[19:39] teachings of the
[19:40] word right he had to go back and pick up
[19:44] that to bring us to the faith of the
[19:47] fathers then when we get to the faith of
[19:50] the fathers you can start talking
[19:53] about the message the prophet brought
[19:56] amen now that's the conten that I've
[19:58] made from 40 years or more preaching on
[20:01] it to you to try to get you to
[20:04] see that see that's why you've got so
[20:07] much Scruples and problems is because
[20:10] you got a bunch of novices that's right
[20:12] you know I'm not making them
[20:15] unregenerated I said novices that are
[20:18] trying to interpret the word of God to
[20:23] us when they don't even know what the
[20:25] word is saying themselves they have
[20:28] Haven experienced it like I've said
[20:30] illustrating it all right I've got one
[20:34] two three three computers in my
[20:37] home we have a slew of them here in the
[20:39] building but the computer is the most
[20:42] damaging thing you could ever think of
[20:44] to this end time people because you can
[20:46] just pull up anything you want to
[20:48] instantly of what is being said and you
[20:51] don't you don't see the ministers that
[20:54] spent the 20 30 years of their lives
[20:57] like I had to do to study the
[21:00] message to search for months for a quote
[21:04] you know just one little thing to search
[21:07] and search through the
[21:09] message they're not familiar with the
[21:11] message nor the Bible that's right
[21:15] because they you know they're just not
[21:17] concerned but uh okay I'm sorry about
[21:21] this morning if you think I was I just
[21:23] kind of had a point and you'd have to
[21:26] know me uh all day yesterday it was
[21:30] there uh last night at the fellowship
[21:33] meeting it was there uh this morning got
[21:37] up with it there come here this morning
[21:39] with it there and when you do then uh it
[21:43] may sound like you're just jumping
[21:45] around fumbling for something but no I
[21:49] want you to know one thing for
[21:53] sure we have had a
[21:56] message we are not looking for a message
[21:58] to come we are not searching for another
[22:02] messenger we are not trying to find
[22:04] somebody else that can interpret this
[22:07] for
[22:08] us we have the Holy Spirit no matter if
[22:13] it's just a birth it's still the Holy
[22:15] Spirit as I was saying the other day why
[22:17] is the trouble when you know the people
[22:19] in the Dark Ages they gave their life
[22:22] for the gospel and the prophet said the
[22:24] same Spirit they had is the Same Spirit
[22:29] in us to just overcome
[22:32] daily well which one would be the worst
[22:34] looking like it look like that's a
[22:36] horrible time back
[22:38] there and it was they physically gave
[22:41] their lives but now you got to live
[22:44] daily and walk in the word of God trying
[22:47] to you know in this day
[22:50] to
[22:53] overcome see if you ask those people
[22:56] said what you know if you could show
[22:57] them both illustrations of where to live
[22:59] here or where to live here and they'd
[23:02] say give me the Gallas you know because
[23:05] that would just be something you could
[23:06] walk up and do but we've got to overcome
[23:10] what lady
[23:12] oia and overcome the
[23:16] uh sorry for wording but the Antichrist
[23:19] moving among the people of the message
[23:23] to uh pervert it to where you cannot be
[23:27] certain amen about what you believe you
[23:30] know because this quote quote quote
[23:32] quote quote all right but see the
[23:34] computers I said it's damaging because
[23:36] people can use it but it's also
[23:38] wonderful that we can use it to the
[23:41] benefit of being able to search out
[23:43] things in a hurry so forgive me if you
[23:46] thought well what was he doing this
[23:47] morning I'm telling you I didn't know
[23:50] that I would change the message until
[23:52] this morning so I had the burden
[23:55] yesterday had it all last night and
[23:58] different things and uh I just tried to
[24:01] drive one thing this morning we're not
[24:04] looking for something else to
[24:06] come this message is the the message
[24:11] that will change us from Mortal to
[24:13] immortality if not we you going to get
[24:17] it this message I believe brother
[24:20] Brandon's message now I'm talking about
[24:23] the message I explained the messenger is
[24:27] not in avable he made mistakes and said
[24:30] things wrong and different kind of
[24:32] things but the
[24:34] message is infallible all right then
[24:38] that message is The Headstone
[24:41] amen what else are you looking
[24:43] for was the Cornerstone the revelation
[24:46] of Jesus Christ we still we read that in
[24:49] the Baptist we studied that we talked
[24:51] about
[24:52] it now why would the headstone be some
[24:55] kind of other something right we'll see
[24:58] that in a minute when we get down to the
[25:00] point of trying to bring out the
[25:03] understanding so you know if you thought
[25:05] well I wonder what was he doing uh one
[25:08] of these days you'll understand me cuz I
[25:10] don't understand me okay all right what
[25:13] was our dealing this morning we were
[25:15] talking about how and Wednesday night we
[25:18] were dealing with it how the messenger
[25:20] comes at the end of the
[25:21] age it always comes at the end of the
[25:24] age we showed you the drawing Wednesday
[25:27] you make your choice you can say well
[25:29] the End of the Age brother could this be
[25:31] this that that's all right I showed it
[25:33] to you Wednesday the end of the age you
[25:36] can come down on the bottom and run out
[25:38] to here top and run out here you come to
[25:41] the same place I showed that Wednesday
[25:43] night all
[25:46] right but if you go one way you're going
[25:48] to lose a lot of the
[25:50] Bible you say well what does it matter
[25:52] just so long as we get there you're not
[25:55] going to get there right you mean God
[25:58] has spent all of this
[26:01] time of trying to get you and I back to
[26:04] the word and he's going to allow us in
[26:07] and let us finish up no
[26:11] this was just part
[26:15] word I don't think so it'll have to be
[26:19] the pure unadulterated word amen all
[26:21] right
[26:23] now we showed this morning and bringing
[26:25] it down how that brother Ram says in the
[26:28] Rapture message not in the time when he
[26:30] begins to
[26:32] sound the but when he's not when he
[26:35] starts out but when he he begins to
[26:38] sound see not when he starts let me
[26:40] restate it right not when he starts but
[26:43] when he begins to sound his message so
[26:46] this message came forth then by
[26:49] somewhere right in there about 62 you
[26:51] can see him driving especially when he
[26:55] gets to sge is this the time
[26:58] he begins to bring it down and laying it
[27:01] in and then he starts going and that's
[27:03] when youve seen the people start turning
[27:06] away from him cuz they knew what he was
[27:09] saying they was accepting him as a
[27:11] prophet and doing this that and the
[27:12] other until he began to say I my
[27:14] father's one well I didn't hear Brother
[27:16] R say that no I didn't hear Jesus say
[27:19] that but that's what he
[27:21] said that's why they killed him because
[27:25] of him saying what he was right well
[27:27] when around and begin to lay it down and
[27:29] say Malachi 4 was supposed to do
[27:32] this here it's done and in the message
[27:35] of Malachi 4 they would be the taking up
[27:39] all the Loose
[27:40] Ends and bringing it down then you see
[27:43] him taking up all the Loose
[27:46] Ends and it would Proclaim to the
[27:48] Rapture of the church and you see him
[27:50] preaching us on the way to the Future
[27:52] home so if you don't follow it that way
[27:55] I'm
[27:56] sorry that's just just the way I am you
[27:59] remember where we were talking about on
[28:00] the end time messenger where he said
[28:03] this message could not have been
[28:05] preached 40 years ago that's right no
[28:09] amen there was no way cuz you you got to
[28:12] have a foundation amen you got to do the
[28:15] first work of
[28:16] Malachi
[28:18] right right before you can do the lies
[28:21] part
[28:23] right CU look what you'd be dealing with
[28:26] you got to turn
[28:28] and they did the Old Testament Saints
[28:30] turned at Calvary coming in Jesus Christ
[28:33] from there to the New Testament message
[28:36] all right but see you and I had to have
[28:39] a
[28:40] restoring of the New Testament message
[28:44] before you can talk about the end time
[28:48] to turn us back to the faith of the
[28:49] fathers I told you don't take it I'm off
[28:52] a stature of a perfect
[28:54] man cuz that's what we were doing we've
[28:57] seen the statue of perfect man is the
[29:00] very point that turns us from what the
[29:03] new birth Faith to back where the
[29:07] disciples
[29:09] were and there's your faith in the
[29:13] fathers but have also said this for 40
[29:16] years and this may sound stupid and
[29:19] crazy but this is the way I think I
[29:23] guess every wor person in the world
[29:28] 7
[29:29] billion this day could have the new
[29:32] birth right it would not be the change
[29:36] of the
[29:41] body right be wonderful world H
[29:45] it everybody in the world could stand at
[29:49] the faith of the
[29:53] fathers be a Wonderful
[29:56] World
[29:58] there wouldn't be no change of the
[30:00] body cuz all you got among the disciples
[30:03] is a prophecy of that change the W drink
[30:06] the line
[30:08] Etc so you see where we got to get to
[30:11] yes it's not to just talk about these
[30:14] virtues to find out what they are
[30:17] right it's for us to strive for them to
[30:20] be made in their our lives by the
[30:23] opening of the
[30:24] word to where we could return to the of
[30:27] the
[30:28] fathers but where do you hear that in
[30:30] the message we don't need that anymore
[30:32] we up here in this we're over here we
[30:33] got this all figured out so I yeah we we
[30:37] got all that great Revelation that seven
[30:38] seal is
[30:39] polygamy and they got it figured out Ain
[30:44] you
[30:46] but ain't nothing you and I can do about
[30:49] that and I ain't concerned about it cuz
[30:52] I'm concerned with you and I those who
[30:56] want to hear yes to come to a place to
[30:59] where we can be changed I'm not excuse
[31:03] me worried about anything else I'm not
[31:04] worried about internet welcome to
[31:06] internet we have people out there that
[31:09] even count this our church their church
[31:11] and sin tith are
[31:12] ween we count them that's part of us but
[31:16] to the rest that's
[31:18] you but yet welcome do the best you
[31:21] can but let's move on in
[31:25] God to where we can see things but you
[31:28] see like I said now on the internet
[31:30] today I said it this morning on the
[31:31] internet today and the preachers around
[31:33] the message they're preaching about the
[31:34] great horrible thing that is happening
[31:36] in
[31:39] Russia brother Joe ran it all far to
[31:42] show where they're voting these
[31:45] things you know what they're
[31:47] voting that you can't have
[31:51] church in a
[31:56] home how many of you live in a
[31:58] subdivision especially built the last 20
[32:06] years when you signed a covenant in
[32:11] that
[32:14] subdivision you know what you
[32:17] signed that you cannot have a religious
[32:21] service in your home with over a certain
[32:23] amount of
[32:26] people
[32:28] but you think we're
[32:30] safe do you know in this
[32:33] community you cannot put a church in
[32:36] this
[32:37] community this city of Lula without it
[32:41] being recognized and associated with a
[32:44] church that is in this community and
[32:47] established that is their
[32:52] law you want to go right over here we
[32:54] can get a witness to it he was the
[32:57] he was up in the and he couldn't get
[33:00] this church right
[33:03] here because one downtown wouldn't allow
[33:05] him to come under their Charter part he
[33:07] had to go over here and get a
[33:08] Pentecostal Church to allow him to come
[33:10] in this community come on
[33:14] Church we're saying well well look at
[33:16] these horrible things happen in these
[33:18] other places look how simple it's coming
[33:20] Among
[33:23] Us
[33:25] okay you don't keep up with those things
[33:27] do you know that in
[33:29] 1974 there was a law passed in Georgia
[33:32] that you couldn't travel over 25 miles
[33:34] to
[33:36] church how many of you came over 25
[33:39] miles get here today okay 99%
[33:44] here but see we we don't look at
[33:50] that we look at it's horrible happening
[33:53] somewhere and it's just closing in
[33:57] that's right
[34:00] okay take it from there you see why that
[34:03] I'm hard and strong and talk the way I
[34:06] do okay but let's get into something now
[34:10] this afternoon from the point of what
[34:12] we've been dealing with about the
[34:14] messenger always comes at the end of the
[34:17] age all right the messenger coming at
[34:20] the end of the age is the most marvelous
[34:23] scriptural um what would you say
[34:27] for a prophet it would take a prophet to
[34:31] understand the statements that he made
[34:35] about the end of an
[34:38] age and I ask you the question you know
[34:41] end of what
[34:42] age right what is the end of the age to
[34:48] you every messenger brother around said
[34:50] come at the End of the Age we'll read
[34:52] we'll read it he said never at the
[34:55] beginning but was at the end of the
[34:58] age he said Paul came at the end of the
[35:02] age well if Paul came at the end of
[35:04] Ephesus how' he bring the message to
[35:12] Ephesus
[35:14] right then we'll let brother brandham
[35:17] we've let him do it but we let him do it
[35:19] again where he resets the things that
[35:22] puts things in perfect
[35:24] order to where that you and I can see
[35:28] but watch this thing that or this part
[35:31] that we talk
[35:34] about that what we're looking at so
[35:36] let's start reading we'll read fight
[35:38] this
[35:40] afternoon look what he says on the 70th
[35:42] week of
[35:44] Daniel he's talking about Al come Wesley
[35:46] and age and you know Wesley and age is
[35:49] called Philadelphia the greatest age age
[35:51] of Love ever had to Philadelphia age and
[35:54] John Wesley's time he went out in
[35:55] Pentecost he went out in come Pentecost
[35:59] and that was lukewarm then we go back
[36:02] and find out what kind of a message
[36:03] would come to the Pentecostals at the
[36:06] end and remember each one's come at the
[36:09] End of the Age St Paul came at the
[36:13] end the rest of them come down at the
[36:16] End St irenius all they all come at the
[36:19] End of the Age so we established that
[36:21] now we got to establish where the ends
[36:25] at
[36:27] you say well we you've already read this
[36:29] over and over to it right deliberately
[36:32] to where we could bring this
[36:35] message and watch the message
[36:38] unfold of the Prophet now
[36:43] watch don't pull up the overlap picture
[36:46] yet brother Joe but pull up the other
[36:47] one we was using or Brother Anderson
[36:50] brother Joe okay everyone's using bring
[36:53] up the one we was using Wednesday night
[36:55] that shows the entire thing
[36:59] of the church agent you
[37:02] know we we redone this in a little bit
[37:04] we'll see another one this one we've
[37:07] used for many years we used it many
[37:09] years we've been using this for many
[37:11] years all right see showing the church
[37:14] ages The
[37:15] Messengers and the length of time as I
[37:19] said this morning I gave it to you don't
[37:21] get caught up in well these Messengers
[37:25] this is one of those one somewhere in
[37:28] here Columba he died in 597 died before
[37:32] the age ever
[37:35] started don't get into that but what did
[37:37] we give you this
[37:38] morning what did Brother around
[37:41] say paragraphs or page 76 Ephesian
[37:45] Church age which is church age book The
[37:49] Death of Paul before the Revelation was
[37:51] given does not at all know the fact that
[37:53] he was a messenger to the Ephesian
[37:55] Church age for the messenger to ever age
[37:59] regardless of when he appears or
[38:02] goes is the one who influences that age
[38:05] for God by means of a word manifested
[38:10] ministry and Paul was that man all right
[38:13] but now we' got to establish did Paul
[38:15] come at the end of the
[38:17] age or did he come right hereen
[38:21] right did he come at the ending of
[38:24] Pentecost amen
[38:30] huh which way did he
[38:32] come go remember now when we get over
[38:36] here there's no Messenger to this age
[38:39] brother Brown says
[38:41] it no Messenger to the lady of s he said
[38:45] the Holy Ghost came
[38:49] himself now you said what's this
[38:54] drawings so
[38:58] but let's think about it so go ahead now
[39:01] remember the drawing the messenger comes
[39:04] at the end of the age and the overlap
[39:06] which is an overlap is an Open
[39:11] Door that's what brother Bown says and
[39:14] got it on in here it's okay we just keep
[39:17] reading but to think about it and see
[39:20] you got the porters we used that years
[39:22] ago in the message remember the porter
[39:24] stands at the door open the
[39:28] door
[39:31] right the shepherd brings the Sheep
[39:34] out and he border can close the door
[39:37] that's in Jesus's ministry right okay
[39:40] now watch so let's just think about it
[39:43] let's read
[39:44] one go ahead now and pull up number two
[39:47] is this the sign of the end sir in
[39:51] Jeffersonville so remember what he
[39:55] said
[39:56] remember the quote we just
[40:01] used go back go back to number one we
[40:03] need it P number one okay
[40:08] look and remember each one's come to
[40:11] come at the End of the Age St Paul at
[40:15] the end rest of them at the end watching
[40:18] come down to the end St irus and all the
[40:21] rest of them the other
[40:24] ones age carried over to the other
[40:30] one lapped
[40:34] over now we'll show in a minute where
[40:36] brother R said there is never an a
[40:39] direct start or an Abrupt end no that's
[40:41] right to an
[40:43] age so we're letting him say it lapped
[40:47] over watching and he taken it up and
[40:51] went on to the next age with it remember
[40:54] you're talking about the body
[40:56] of Jesus
[40:58] Christ right through the seven Church
[41:02] ages the body of Jesus Christ go ahead
[41:05] now number
[41:07] two is this a sign of the end sir he's
[41:10] talking about the seal tore loose Paul
[41:12] was the first messenger we found what
[41:14] did he do declared war on what what did
[41:18] Paul declare war
[41:20] on if he come is where you're saying the
[41:23] End of the
[41:24] Age like on over you
[41:27] know what did he declare war
[41:30] on Paul didn't declare war on the age of
[41:34] Ephesus he brought the message to
[41:38] Ephesus
[41:40] right so watch what he says he AG had
[41:44] his messenger Paul was the first
[41:45] messenger and when the first trumpet
[41:47] sounded and the first seal was Troke
[41:49] loose remember this is when he was
[41:51] bringing the ages The Messengers before
[41:53] the F seals broke Paul was the first
[41:55] messenger find out what did he do
[41:57] declared war on
[42:00] what not the first church
[42:02] age he declared war on the Orthodox
[42:07] Church for not believing the Messiah
[42:12] sign that Jesus had produced to
[42:18] them are you
[42:20] reading who did Paul
[42:23] rebuke the
[42:25] Pentecostals from getting
[42:27] away from the Messiah sign of the Lord
[42:31] Jesus Christ or the resurrected Lord
[42:34] Jesus Christ living among
[42:36] us who did he do right declared war on
[42:40] what now watch it a messenger rebukes
[42:44] the previous age brings a message to his
[42:49] age okay so who did Paul declare war
[42:54] on the Orthodox Church
[42:57] not the first church
[43:00] age
[43:01] right okay how about
[43:05] it now watch he bring in something that
[43:08] will be very
[43:10] helpful if you'll
[43:12] listen and think about it going to
[43:14] number
[43:18] three this is taken from the lest in
[43:21] church age that's preached in 60 121 I
[43:24] do that because Church age book is I'll
[43:28] always say Church age book I Define it
[43:31] all right the angel of this lady is in
[43:34] age to end it up now he will be at the
[43:37] End of the Age like the rest of them
[43:40] like the
[43:42] Bible come
[43:45] on at the end of it because the angel
[43:49] always comes to
[43:51] rebuke for them for what they
[43:54] done to the the angel of the Church of
[43:57] ladyo seea write these
[44:00] things Paul in the first church age
[44:04] rebuked them for getting away you want
[44:07] to read it Revelations 2 and
[44:11] 4 we rebuke them from getting away from
[44:14] their first
[44:16] love he's rebuking
[44:20] Pentecost watch
[44:23] him he comes to rebuke to the angel of
[44:26] the Church of Samar write these things
[44:28] each one is to the angel at the End of
[44:30] the Age Paul the end of the age and on
[44:34] down End of the Age the lap
[44:37] over
[44:39] now End of the Age End of the Age that's
[44:43] what makes it
[44:46] lap what makes it
[44:49] lap because the messenger comes to
[44:53] rebuke backward and and bring his
[44:56] message forward he's in the
[45:00] overlap what is the overlap we're going
[45:02] to get to it in a minute where brother R
[45:03] said is
[45:04] what it's the open door which is a
[45:07] revelation of Jesus Christ Paul had a
[45:10] message right unto the angel of the
[45:13] church at
[45:15] Ephesus he rebuked the Pentecostals
[45:18] right for getting away from their first
[45:20] love and brought the message to the
[45:23] church in
[45:24] Ephesus right now watch him see it makes
[45:28] a lap over to the angel speaking what
[45:32] was this laps over here to the angel in
[45:36] the end of that age see picking up right
[45:39] here making the lap like stair steps
[45:42] going up in the seven Church
[45:46] ages a lap
[45:49] over between every age it's hard to draw
[45:52] you'll have to look real careful go
[45:54] ahead brother Joe and pull this up cuz I
[45:56] asked them back there to do a lot of
[45:58] impossible things but they always do it
[46:02] and get it up for me so go ahead and
[46:04] pull it up what we tried to draw if
[46:07] you'll see what we done we pulled them
[46:10] together where the other had to do it
[46:12] like this but now you can see it better
[46:14] here cuz you can't see it over there in
[46:15] the dark look
[46:20] here there's your
[46:24] overlap there overlap between every age
[46:28] there never an Abrupt end of Ephesus a
[46:31] start of samna God never does anything
[46:33] like that I love him for that the one
[46:36] that really caught me to show his
[46:38] grace is when brother brandham said God
[46:42] dealt with Israel 40
[46:45] years after
[46:50] Pentecost you said we did he give them
[46:52] the Holy Ghost
[46:54] no they had to come up in the church to
[46:57] do but he dealt with them he didn't stop
[47:01] dealing with them until after Titus come
[47:04] in and Destroy
[47:07] Jerusalem 40
[47:09] years that God was dealing with him
[47:12] after they had rejected him what a
[47:15] wonderful God you and I
[47:17] serve watch this as we catch the overlap
[47:20] now see you say where did Paul come
[47:23] right here which was Pentecost
[47:26] right here Iranians Falls Martin
[47:32] Columba and an
[47:35] overlap God makes an
[47:37] overlap but what is the
[47:42] overlap well it's just this one age
[47:44] running into this age no it's
[47:46] not remember this statement until
[47:50] Wednesday there has never been a bride
[47:53] in an
[47:54] age show it to to
[47:56] me we're in lady OA yes physically
[47:59] speaking it's out here but we're
[48:01] supposed to be born out of the
[48:07] age well no we still in the
[48:10] age boy you
[48:13] really I thought the new birth called us
[48:16] out of the age right Y into
[48:22] Christ right so then remember the
[48:25] lifeover now it'll be between each
[48:28] one never an ending of one age and a
[48:32] start of
[48:34] another you would not have the lap over
[48:37] if you done
[48:39] that you got to let one lap into the
[48:41] other that's
[48:43] right you realize in the days uh let's
[48:47] see can I
[48:50] quote I'll get names wrong so I won't
[48:53] try somebody wanted brother brand this
[48:55] is a story told you probably heard it
[48:58] one brother Rand would go talk to their
[49:00] father I believe it
[49:03] was he's up in
[49:06] age brother Ram goes to talk to
[49:09] him and he's in ner life in and having a
[49:12] big
[49:17] time when he comes out they ask him what
[49:20] about it said your daddy is in another
[49:24] age
[49:26] amen you realize God is so great until
[49:29] he didn't tell it to all the lutherans
[49:32] that when Wesley started his message
[49:34] that all you people are lost that don't
[49:36] take his word right now it was years
[49:39] back there before the message could
[49:43] spread from one place to
[49:45] another so it's an
[49:49] overlap overlap the overlap is not just
[49:53] age that's why your messenger stand
[49:55] there overlap is a revelation of Jesus
[49:59] Christ that's where your messenger
[50:01] stands in that revelation of Jesus
[50:05] Christ rebuking the ones getting away
[50:07] from it bringing the message forward
[50:10] okay go ahead let's pick it up he said
[50:13] that's this lap over here he said that's
[50:17] what makes it
[50:19] lap that the Messenger stand in a
[50:22] position so go ahead to number four
[50:26] it makes him
[50:27] stand in a position in what just
[50:32] standing
[50:33] somewhere where is the messenger
[50:37] standing in Jesus
[50:40] Christ
[50:44] right that's his
[50:48] message it's an Open Door
[50:52] amen it's a
[50:54] leftover Paul had the message of Jesus
[50:57] irenius had the message of Jesus
[51:02] yes
[51:03] right your lap over is the Revelation
[51:07] that's right TimeWise it's a man
[51:10] standing with the message that's why
[51:13] that if you look back at the drawing you
[51:15] can't figure out by the date of the age
[51:17] of the person was and put it in the
[51:22] place right Columba was that
[51:27] was dead years dead before the
[51:31] age ever
[51:34] started now your's where I was this
[51:40] morning do you realize what a prophet
[51:46] is have you ever thought about it
[51:50] yes a true prophet of God you realize
[51:52] what he
[51:54] is we talk about him as being what God's
[51:57] mouthpiece right the one who speaks for
[52:01] God so
[52:04] now John on
[52:07] patmas right he
[52:10] wrote the message to each Church age
[52:14] right yes now was that God doing
[52:19] that we have to agree
[52:21] right God placed the ages with the
[52:25] churches that was there around in that
[52:28] area and placing it to John right God
[52:32] placed the
[52:36] ages your Prophet
[52:39] said the one closest to the
[52:43] truth why did he not choose go to your
[52:46] church age book and read it brother R
[52:48] spoke twice as much of
[52:52] polycarp as he did irenius
[52:57] read your church
[53:00] hbook took tce as much time talking
[53:03] about
[53:06] polycarp but what did he
[53:10] say he said polycarp lent to
[53:15] organization he said and that was the
[53:18] reason he was rejected as the messenger
[53:22] you know what he's
[53:23] saying you ever thought about that who
[53:27] rejected what to do what he said and
[53:29] that was the reason he was rejected you
[53:31] know evidently brother Brown probably
[53:32] had him wrote down is the
[53:35] Angel
[53:37] right come
[53:39] on why would he say it that
[53:41] away he said polycart was rejected so he
[53:46] probably had it wrote down Paul
[53:51] polycarp and God says no son that's it's
[53:55] not here it's
[54:00] ireneus and Paul brother R went back and
[54:03] checked out polycarp's
[54:07] life I read a little bit out of the pren
[54:10] in
[54:11] fathers polycarp had a great
[54:15] Revelation the only thing brother R City
[54:17] could find was he lent towards organized
[54:23] religion you understand what I
[54:26] mean brother Ram was probably going to
[54:28] put polycarp
[54:30] there course there's no name to the ages
[54:32] F the holy spirit said
[54:36] uhuh who put Martin there who put
[54:39] Columba who put Luther
[54:44] Wesley and who put the holy ghost coming
[54:46] on the day
[54:48] of zusa
[54:50] Street in the fullness of the
[54:54] baptism it's what your Prophet said
[54:56] we're going to read it we've done read
[54:57] it over and over
[54:59] right who put him there who picked the
[55:02] messengers was it brother
[55:04] brandham that's the point I'm trying to
[55:06] get you to
[55:08] see John wrote the ages and
[55:11] the who it's too you know Ephesus samna
[55:17] per brother brandham had to be in the
[55:19] same
[55:20] spirit that John had right y and then he
[55:25] put Paul irenius Martin
[55:32] Columba don't you think brother Ram knew
[55:34] that Columbo wasn't even born in that
[55:38] age he done a lot of
[55:43] research so was the age over here or was
[55:47] the age over
[55:48] here was it matter because no bride no
[55:53] Born Again believer fever is in a church
[55:58] age my brother brandom could say lady
[56:02] yosia is
[56:05] over then need say lady oia will end
[56:09] when the bride is taken out then he'll
[56:12] say lady osia the 7th will go all the
[56:16] way through the
[56:20] Millennium he knew what he's talking
[56:23] about it's us sit down
[56:28] right you so what's the importance of
[56:30] that I want to make sure I'm in that
[56:34] overlap
[56:37] right if we're not in the overlap we're
[56:39] not called out of the
[56:42] church now may I remind you of
[56:45] something that own the drawing in your
[56:49] of the where it was draw out at
[56:53] Jeffersonville you better believe
[56:55] there's no bride in an
[56:56] age if you don't you got a lot of
[57:00] trouble the blackness in there was not
[57:03] the bride have you got that much
[57:06] sense the Blackness was not the
[57:10] bride you know what the last age was
[57:13] brother random said I left a little
[57:17] light he said because it went into total
[57:23] darkness if you can't look out turn now
[57:25] and see how dark lady yourself is you're
[57:27] you're sure spiritually
[57:29] blind
[57:31] right but you see the bride was never in
[57:34] that
[57:36] age you said we're in the bride age
[57:39] every age at a bride age right amen
[57:42] there's a great meaning to that we'll
[57:43] get on it Wednesday what are you looking
[57:45] at it I want to be in the
[57:48] overlap I want to be where the messenger
[57:50] at don't
[57:53] you
[57:56] come on is that right the scripture said
[57:57] we got to go out under him he was
[58:00] crucified outside the
[58:03] camp well I you stay in the camp no no
[58:06] that's not
[58:07] Bible it's Bible to go out of the camp
[58:13] to where he's
[58:15] at out of Lady OA into
[58:20] Christ well what you mean we're still in
[58:22] let you see it I hope you got sense to
[58:25] realize I got a little sense and can can
[58:27] look around the AG is
[58:32] there but we're supposed to be called
[58:34] out of the age that's right that's why
[58:37] the scripture would say love not the
[58:40] world and the things of the
[58:42] world because that's the
[58:46] age okay I'm
[58:49] slow but
[58:52] listen let's go ahead I want to make
[58:54] sure that
[58:55] CU we're going to deal a lot with this
[58:56] overlap even we have to cut some
[58:59] others but look at number four we've
[59:02] been over this one in the first
[59:04] seal brother brandham
[59:08] explains the church
[59:10] ages and look what he
[59:13] says then Along Came the Pentecostal age
[59:15] with the baptism of the Holy Spirit and
[59:18] they cabbaged down on
[59:20] that
[59:21] yeah there cannot be no more a
[59:25] ages that's all of it listen that's the
[59:28] philad r not the that's the lady oan age
[59:31] and we found in the study of the
[59:33] scripture that the messenger come to the
[59:36] end come to the age Messenger to the age
[59:39] come right at the end of the age every
[59:41] time Paul came come at the End of the
[59:44] Age we find out at renius at the End of
[59:48] the Age Martin at the End of the Age
[59:50] look
[59:51] Luther the end of the Catholic age
[59:55] there is no Catholic age of the seven
[59:58] Church
[1:00:00] ages but it's a Catholic age because
[1:00:02] it's a Dark
[1:00:05] Age the Thousand Years of
[1:00:08] Darkness of the Catholic
[1:00:11] church and Luther comes out of that
[1:00:15] Darkness stands in the overlap what is
[1:00:17] his overlap the revelation of the just
[1:00:21] shall live by faith that's what made the
[1:00:23] overlap yeah that's
[1:00:26] right he stands in the Revelation look
[1:00:28] at him Luther at the end of the Catholic
[1:00:32] and what Wesley at the end of the
[1:00:35] Lutheran age so now he's telling you
[1:00:39] Wesley comes at the end of Luther's age
[1:00:42] all right now that's what he had to say
[1:00:44] Wesley we think that what Wesley came at
[1:00:48] the end of Luther's age he didn't come
[1:00:50] up here he come at the end of Luther's
[1:00:52] age and he overlap
[1:00:55] come on read your
[1:00:59] message and then what did he say took
[1:01:01] place and Pentecost at the end of
[1:01:05] sanctification through the baptism of
[1:01:07] the Holy
[1:01:10] Ghost so at the End of the
[1:01:15] Age of Wesley come who oh Elijah
[1:01:23] came hold on be a point look and at the
[1:01:27] end of the Pentecostal
[1:01:31] age the Holy Ghost came we're going to
[1:01:33] reread that one right at the end of the
[1:01:35] Pentecostal age we're supposed to
[1:01:36] receive according to the word now you
[1:01:38] know what Pentecostal age Pentecostal AG
[1:01:40] is Lady OFA right you're not talking
[1:01:43] about back there in the Bible it's the
[1:01:44] Pentecostal age is the lady OFA and age
[1:01:47] I got to quote if you need
[1:01:49] it and we're supposed to receive
[1:01:51] according to the word as God helped me
[1:01:54] tonight not to show you through here
[1:01:56] that we are to see receive a messenger
[1:01:58] that will take all those loose ends out
[1:02:01] there and reveal the whole Secret Of God
[1:02:05] for the
[1:02:06] rapturing of the
[1:02:09] church now where did Brother randam come
[1:02:11] into being at
[1:02:16] then all
[1:02:18] right where would it take
[1:02:22] place we'll get back to it in just a
[1:02:24] minute but I was trying to find it I've
[1:02:26] got it in
[1:02:28] here it's in the the questions and
[1:02:32] answers on the seals I got on one of the
[1:02:34] other he said no Messenger to the
[1:02:38] age because the Holy Ghost came in his
[1:02:42] fullness onusa
[1:02:45] street but see everybody in the message
[1:02:47] well zusa Street didn't have nothing
[1:02:50] brother R said it had the fullness of
[1:02:52] the Holy Spirit
[1:02:56] the fullness of the baptism he calls it
[1:02:58] another great
[1:03:05] prophet but we
[1:03:07] don't may I quot it this way Paul said I
[1:03:10] become your enemy because I tell you the
[1:03:11] truth have I become your enemy because I
[1:03:13] can remember and have
[1:03:16] read cuz I was reading this and teaching
[1:03:19] this before the computer ever come into
[1:03:21] being amen you know for me right
[1:03:26] I was teaching this in the the late 60s
[1:03:29] and early
[1:03:32] 70s
[1:03:34] right no
[1:03:36] problem all right we'll get to that in a
[1:03:39] minute but just remember if you need it
[1:03:41] I'll be glad to find it in in my message
[1:03:45] somewhere if not we can find it in a
[1:03:49] hurry
[1:03:51] see why
[1:03:55] because the Holy Ghost came on the day
[1:03:57] of Pentecost ausa Street
[1:04:00] Pentecost now back onusa street the Holy
[1:04:03] Ghost came himself so what your Prophet
[1:04:06] said I've give it to you two or three
[1:04:07] times if you need it brother Joe if you
[1:04:09] can find that part I had it in my notes
[1:04:11] and I got it laying here in my Bible
[1:04:13] somewhere and if you need it I can find
[1:04:16] it in
[1:04:19] here CU I don't say nothing and I can't
[1:04:22] prove the prophet said it
[1:04:25] okay okay we got
[1:04:28] it
[1:04:31] paragraphs is paragraph
[1:04:37] 52 on questions and answers on the SE
[1:04:39] paragraph 52 and you see each one of
[1:04:42] those ages only taking a dip into the
[1:04:44] Holy Spirit justification is the work of
[1:04:46] the Holy Spirit but the baptism is the
[1:04:49] holy spirit I watch you that's the
[1:04:51] reason it took a prophetic Prophet to
[1:04:53] come down
[1:04:55] no Messenger to the
[1:04:59] age the oneeyed black man was not listed
[1:05:02] as one of the ear early as one of the
[1:05:04] church age angels you only have seven
[1:05:08] angels brother Brown calls him the
[1:05:11] messenger right but he's not one of the
[1:05:15] Angels why because it's the Holy Ghost
[1:05:18] himself
[1:05:20] look that's the reason it took a
[1:05:22] prophetic Prophet to come down no matter
[1:05:24] Messenger to the age cuz the Holy Ghost
[1:05:26] came himself in the fullness of his
[1:05:28] baptism I surely don't hope you think
[1:05:30] that's brother
[1:05:31] brandham go here but at the end of the
[1:05:34] age as it always ends upon the others we
[1:05:37] F find there then the messenger sin and
[1:05:41] all of these Scruples and
[1:05:43] things
[1:05:45] right so you're a prophet know what he
[1:05:48] was talking
[1:05:50] about but we said no zeusa Street didn't
[1:05:52] have nothing they just oh they just
[1:05:54] didn't have
[1:05:56] nothing he called it the fullness of the
[1:05:59] baptism
[1:06:01] okay that's paragraph 52 questions and
[1:06:04] answers on the seals
[1:06:07] 1963 okay I want to get this overl go
[1:06:10] ahead to number five Philadelphian
[1:06:12] Church

[1:06:17] time just at the end times to rebuke the
[1:06:19] church for it for losing its first love
[1:06:23] and how it's got away from God like they
[1:06:25] did that's Paul
[1:06:27] rebuking Pentecost for losing his first
[1:06:30] love Orthodox church we read that a
[1:06:32] minute ago like they did down through

[1:11:13] want to see the Revelation here is where
[1:11:16] he would build his church and the only
[1:11:19] way that he could take his church is
[1:11:22] back to the revelation
[1:11:24] of what he
[1:11:27] is it's not a messenger standing
[1:11:30] between
[1:11:35] time that's why you don't even have to
[1:11:37] be in the Age
[1:11:39] part it's his
[1:11:46] Revelation come on Paul and them I mean
[1:11:49] uh West and them were trinitarians right
[1:11:53] but you want to read some of the little
[1:11:55] books M I've got
[1:11:57] about you want to read how he bragged on
[1:12:00] Jesus for being
[1:12:05] God but then when he finalized it up he
[1:12:07] said but said he is the third third
[1:12:10] person of the
[1:12:12] Trinity because he didn't know the
[1:12:14] Revelation right and God begin to
[1:12:18] restore the
[1:12:20] name and it was lost and couldn't be
[1:12:22] found

[1:12:37] that's
[1:12:39] right come on folks if you missed the
[1:12:42] whole rest of the message remember this
[1:12:46] Prophet that we speak
[1:12:50] of Elijah of this day we he knows the
[1:12:53] Lord Jesus Christ but he had to have a
[1:12:55] man to work through do you realize he
[1:12:58] stood between man and Eternity in the
[1:13:03] open
[1:13:05] door do you realize his message is the
[1:13:09] open door you realize his message opened
[1:13:14] heaven to where we could
[1:13:18] go right
[1:13:22] am
[1:13:25] his deity if you want to see it go ahead
[1:13:28] to the next
[1:13:29] one that was a Philadelphia that was
[1:13:31] paragraph 140 uh 1-
[1:13:35] 143 this is paragraph 128 the
[1:13:38] Philadelphian
[1:13:40] church now what door was opened about
[1:13:46] Jesus between these two
[1:13:48] ages see just between
[1:13:51] 1906 about when the Methodist age and
[1:13:55] the Dwight Moody of them and them faded
[1:13:57] from the scene there come forth A Break
[1:14:00] Forth there come forth they break forth
[1:14:03] of the people receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:14:06] speaking with tongues and things come
[1:14:08] back into the church that's about right
[1:14:10] in about 1906 along in there all right
[1:14:14] what took place
[1:14:16] then after that begin to come along the
[1:14:20] first thing you know they organized now
[1:14:22] he even names of people that started
[1:14:25] doing
[1:14:27] it they organized the old General
[1:14:30] Council which went in which went in now
[1:14:34] called the Assemblies of God what see
[1:14:38] out of the
[1:14:40] church out of that church that was
[1:14:43] lapped over and what took place to them
[1:14:46] he said an Open
[1:14:50] Door a revelation of his Supreme deal
[1:14:55] is the open
[1:14:56] door the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:15:00] coming back to the
[1:15:02] church the name of Jesus being
[1:15:07] restored we've got out of our Hope from
[1:15:09] looking at laugh over and ages and
[1:15:11] things and thinking about a man standing
[1:15:14] put him standing there in the Revelation
[1:15:16] that he's
[1:15:20] got you realize in this messenger stood
[1:15:24] where no man has ever
[1:15:27] stood between Time and Eternity in the
[1:15:31] overlap which is an open door between
[1:15:34] the ladyo see and
[1:15:36] age and
[1:15:38] Eternity putting him coming at the end
[1:15:41] of the
[1:15:42] age to bring the message end of what
[1:15:45] eight age of
[1:15:47] Time Eternity is not an
[1:15:50] age he stood between to bring the
[1:15:54] message in the lap
[1:15:59] over the open
[1:16:02] door what about it
[1:16:04] Church see that's what makes the lap
[1:16:09] over an Open Door what makes the lap
[1:16:18] over watch what he says go to
[1:16:21] 10 now let him say to you where you
[1:16:23] won't be fuss and we be about it this is
[1:16:27] the message of baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:29] 1958 but he said Just Between the
[1:16:32] Methodist and
[1:16:34] Pentecostals going out you know going
[1:16:36] out of Methodist coming into Pentecostal
[1:16:39] I have set an open door before you there
[1:16:42] you are the name restored
[1:16:47] again I have set an open door but I'm
[1:16:51] the way the truth and the life no man
[1:16:53] comes to the father except through me
[1:16:55] what is it that Open Door you realize
[1:17:00] that you and
[1:17:02] I right
[1:17:05] now by the revelation of God are
[1:17:10] standing in an open
[1:17:14] door not in
[1:17:19] Philadelphia not in lady
[1:17:22] oia
[1:17:24] the revelation of this message has
[1:17:26] called us out of the
[1:17:29] age into Jesus
[1:17:32] Christ and he's the
[1:17:37] word so the prophet's message then is
[1:17:42] what the
[1:17:44] headstone
[1:17:45] amen let's see if I can think of the
[1:17:49] quote in the something he's a
[1:17:51] Cornerstone in the full Church he's The
[1:17:54] Headstone that's a direct quote on the
[1:17:56] last part I
[1:17:57] know in the church like you know he was
[1:18:00] the Cornerstone but said in the entire
[1:18:02] bride he's the
[1:18:06] headstone this is the age excuse
[1:18:10] me this is the age when the entire
[1:18:13] revelation of Jesus Christ is to be
[1:18:15] brought
[1:18:16] forth it's not just talking about ages
[1:18:19] and buildings and places and
[1:18:21] doings
[1:18:23] is to illustrate to try to show where
[1:18:26] we're
[1:18:30] at see we're supposed to be called out
[1:18:32] of the
[1:18:36] age but you know what our biggest
[1:18:38] problem
[1:18:39] is we're L we're uh too much
[1:18:46] spiritual to be worth a lot
[1:18:49] natural because of what we're thinking
[1:18:51] about well we're too much natural to be
[1:18:54] very much
[1:18:56] spiritual
[1:18:58] right cuz we still are in the
[1:19:01] age time is out
[1:19:04] here but we're supposed to be in Jesus
[1:19:08] Christ and when God looks down and sees
[1:19:10] his bride in the end
[1:19:13] time he sees her standing wrapped in his
[1:19:17] robe of
[1:19:20] righteousness the
[1:19:21] revelation of Jesus
[1:19:26] Christ what is the message of this age
[1:19:29] how much greater could any man have ever
[1:19:32] spoke about Jesus Christ than this
[1:19:35] Prophet messenger
[1:19:39] amen but yet I ask you how many of you
[1:19:41] ever read this church age
[1:19:44] book I ain't asking for no raising
[1:19:47] hands afid it might be embarrassing cuz
[1:19:50] you know you
[1:19:51] go I got half of
[1:19:54] it how many of you ever read to seal a
[1:20:01] book how many ever read all the
[1:20:07] books we got one hand back
[1:20:10] there that says she's read every book
[1:20:12] and I believe her
[1:20:16] yeah she may not have all the books I
[1:20:18] have but she's read all she's got but
[1:20:21] she may have more than I've got
[1:20:23] but I've read every
[1:20:26] book that I
[1:20:29] have why because if I'm going to believe
[1:20:32] this message to
[1:20:34] be the end time message I don't have to
[1:20:37] worry about trying to find anything else
[1:20:40] I'm not concerned with Russia doing this
[1:20:43] or this doing that you know there was
[1:20:45] somebody telling me who was it that
[1:20:48] brother this morning telling me that
[1:20:50] they're saying that Obama is the King of
[1:20:52] the South and and Putin's a king of the
[1:20:56] north boy they got a good
[1:20:59] Revelation none of that ain't got
[1:21:01] nothing to do with the
[1:21:03] Antichrist that's right oh yeah both of
[1:21:05] them's Antichrist that's no problem but
[1:21:07] that's that's not what you're talking
[1:21:11] about see I don't mind preaching to
[1:21:13] people that know what the prophet has
[1:21:16] said because you at least got to
[1:21:19] admit that I'm bringing what he said
[1:21:22] amen well you've left this out bring it
[1:21:25] to
[1:21:26] me bring it to me something I've left
[1:21:31] out and I'll read it to
[1:21:35] you because I want to be
[1:21:38] right but you see church it's not
[1:21:40] natural things or overlaps or places or
[1:21:44] what it's a
[1:21:46] revelation of Jesus Christ I thought
[1:21:49] brother brandham said that that was what
[1:21:51] the new birth was
[1:21:53] off of Christ of mystery that it's a
[1:21:55] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[1:21:58] you well then what would he say in
[1:22:00] Christ of Myster what is The
[1:22:03] Headstone y it be the revelation of
[1:22:06] Jesus Christ personally to you in the
[1:22:10] highest high highest height of where
[1:22:12] it's supposed to go
[1:22:16] to why wouldn't you want to know about
[1:22:19] Jesus but yet you know all about
[1:22:21] everything else and
[1:22:25] world
[1:22:27] right they life at any and I because we
[1:22:30] can't you know we can't even order
[1:22:34] something off of a
[1:22:37] computer we're computer illiterate I use
[1:22:40] mine for what I
[1:22:43] need but
[1:22:45] yet you know all about that but do you
[1:22:47] know about the
[1:22:50] seals do you know about about the
[1:22:53] restoration of the Bri tree do you know
[1:22:56] about Daniel 70
[1:23:00] weeks we proved that in the talking to
[1:23:03] the
[1:23:04] ministers yeah out of 30 ministers maybe
[1:23:08] five or six of them had never read the
[1:23:13] book of Daniel 70 weeks but yet they
[1:23:16] could tell you how wrong you
[1:23:21] are never read the
[1:23:25] book A lot of them didn't even have a
[1:23:30] book but they can tell you all how wrong
[1:23:32] you
[1:23:39] are at least church we ought to be the
[1:23:42] most Jehovah Witness reading room people
[1:23:46] that has ever been and I'm not making
[1:23:48] lie to them to have a great thing they
[1:23:51] sit down and read and they get get it
[1:23:52] all figured out and when they come to
[1:23:54] your house you say so and so they say so
[1:23:56] and so you say so and so they say so cuz
[1:23:58] why cuz they
[1:24:03] trained
[1:24:05] right you ask the people this man I
[1:24:08] don't really
[1:24:09] know like one preacher said one time he
[1:24:12] said now he said that adoption is
[1:24:16] simple but he said that stature of
[1:24:18] perfect man is
[1:24:21] deep well I thought that's what it
[1:24:24] was I thought the statue of prect man
[1:24:26] told you I to come to adoption we're
[1:24:27] going to get to that we're heading that
[1:24:29] way I thought that's what told us how to
[1:24:31] become
[1:24:38] adopted what about it come on
[1:24:40] brothers let's just
[1:24:44] quit I for out my heart to
[1:24:47] you I told you I had a burden last night
[1:24:50] and I had to get it off this morning off
[1:24:52] of that part to try to bring the the
[1:24:55] things into the right
[1:24:58] place and to make
[1:25:02] sure cuz you see now they're going to
[1:25:04] start moving in because they've got
[1:25:08] to and do you think that the Believers
[1:25:11] of this message won't turn you
[1:25:21] in they think they're doing God a
[1:25:24] service you think all these on the
[1:25:26] internet claiming brother Brown was
[1:25:27] wrong you think they're not trying to
[1:25:29] say they're doing you a service to save
[1:25:32] you from this
[1:25:36] cult what about
[1:25:40] it but do you
[1:25:42] see why there is an
[1:25:45] overlap because listen it's one
[1:25:49] Revelation overlapping into the next one
[1:25:53] all
[1:25:56] right this is coming forth the next
[1:25:59] messenger goes back overlaps his message
[1:26:03] and carries it right on May I quote
[1:26:05] brother
[1:26:07] R all of the prophets in the bible what
[1:26:11] did they
[1:26:15] do they made an illustration I'm not
[1:26:18] saying he was wrong I'm just saying I
[1:26:20] doubt a lot of he knowed each other
[1:26:22] but what's he
[1:26:25] saying he said no Prophet would bring
[1:26:27] his message until he checked it with a
[1:26:31] prophet before
[1:26:33] him that's paraphrasing but it's close
[1:26:36] enough he checks his message by the
[1:26:39] prophet
[1:26:41] before that's how Daniel knew that he
[1:26:44] was going to be out of there in two
[1:26:49] years because he lefted it back to the
[1:26:53] other one you look at those Church
[1:26:55] ages Paul coming in there with that
[1:26:58] great Revelation listen and brother
[1:27:00] Brandon says the pure unadulterated word
[1:27:04] lasted for
[1:27:09] ages then it began to
[1:27:12] deteriorate you realize Paul when
[1:27:15] ireneus come
[1:27:16] along he looked back to
[1:27:21] Paul
[1:27:22] when Martin came along that R around on
[1:27:24] credits as being the greatest of
[1:27:29] all never hardly a meeting that he
[1:27:31] didn't have signs and wonders in
[1:27:33] Martin's
[1:27:35] life but he look
[1:27:37] back to the one before
[1:27:39] him and said I'm lined
[1:27:44] up what about brother brandom standing
[1:27:47] looking all the way
[1:27:49] back oh he bypass Luther and wesle him
[1:27:53] because didn't it
[1:27:56] now you better believe one thing for
[1:28:00] sure if you got the Holy Ghost today you
[1:28:03] ain't going to reject Luther's message
[1:28:05] of that just shall live by faith that's
[1:28:09] right now he's teachings of other things
[1:28:12] the godhead and
[1:28:13] thing but remember God winked at those
[1:28:17] ignorances but he don't wink
[1:28:21] anymore
[1:28:23] right that's right right he commands all
[1:28:26] men to repent the scripture say we have
[1:28:29] no excuse would you see I could stand
[1:28:31] and Shake Martin Luther's hand and say
[1:28:34] thank God for the message you
[1:28:37] brought of the just shall live by
[1:28:40] faith and I ain't going to look down but
[1:28:42] now you just kind of a little mixed up
[1:28:43] you know now you ain't up here where we
[1:28:46] at oh I left it laying and N thing where
[1:28:50] Joe ran it off when something to similar
[1:28:53] if you think you're something you just
[1:28:55] going to find out you ain't
[1:28:58] nothing that's the best way to say it do
[1:29:01] you understand then we'll go into the
[1:29:03] bride age and then we'll pick up another
[1:29:06] message or
[1:29:08] two that is the messenger would come at
[1:29:10] the end of the age he would
[1:29:13] rebuke the people of the previous age
[1:29:16] from getting away from their messenger
[1:29:18] and then he bring the message brother
[1:29:21] Ram
[1:29:23] what did he
[1:29:25] say he said to paraphrase but he says
[1:29:31] the the Baptist can look the if I get
[1:29:34] them wrong put them you put them in the
[1:29:36] right place he say like the Baptist can
[1:29:38] look at the Methodist and and tell them
[1:29:40] they're
[1:29:41] wrong and he said the Pentecostals can
[1:29:44] look at them and tell the Methodist said
[1:29:46] wrong I'm paraphrasing but very
[1:29:48] close he said but I can look back
[1:29:52] and tell them all they're
[1:29:57] wrong you know little a prophet stands
[1:30:01] before no
[1:30:03] one that's why all these goofballs think
[1:30:07] they're doing
[1:30:09] something you can't correct a prophet
[1:30:14] amen we talking about it last
[1:30:17] night what do you think about the
[1:30:20] prophet that was told to go marry a
[1:30:24] prostitute and have children
[1:30:30] bu now that's contrary to the Bible
[1:30:33] isn't it
[1:30:36] right how is God going to condemn that
[1:30:38] Prophet when he told him to do
[1:30:45] it
[1:30:49] right it was contrary to the word to go
[1:30:51] do it
[1:30:56] come on I got a lot of questions that I
[1:30:59] love to ask
[1:31:00] people those are things that maybe we
[1:31:04] don't have to figure
[1:31:06] out they're there that's
[1:31:10] right what is he going to judge
[1:31:12] Everybody
[1:31:14] by the word for the age he's not going
[1:31:17] to judge the Baptist by the Methodist
[1:31:20] message he's not going to judge the the
[1:31:23] Methodist by the Pentecostal message
[1:31:25] he's not going to judge you and I by
[1:31:27] Methodist Baptist Pentecostals or
[1:31:29] whatever he's going to judge us by this
[1:31:32] message that has been brought to you and
[1:31:35] I and judge us because we haven't made
[1:31:39] ourselves
[1:31:41] available to the
[1:31:49] message well brother D we just don't
[1:31:52] have time I got to do this that and the
