grateful to be able to gather together around your word tonight lord and we're just looking to you lord jesus to give us something lord to encourage us in the the middle of the week here lord jesus

that we can look to that where the twos and threes are gathered together in your name that you'll be gathered with us lord jesus and we've come together with our little licks of fire this afternoon lord together around your word and look into your promises i pray god that you'll fulfill your word lord tonight lord come and move among us lord jesus lord we've opened up our hearts to you now lord jesus you come and lord and quicken your word to us and make it real we ask in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen now ii peter uh this is this is a very uh familiar scripture to us all and it says here in second peter of simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord according as his divine power it's his divine power that's given unto us hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises now there's something you can hang on to we've got a lot of promises that have been given to us that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust so he's given us a promise that we can be partakers of the divine nature and and a promise that if you obey the word and listen to the word and receive the word it'll call you out of the world and escape the corruption that is in the world through lust and he goes on and says and besides inside beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and divert your knowledge into knowledge temperance and the temperance patience and the patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and the brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be bear nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall for so and entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ you can be seated the lord has a blessing to the word now you know it's as you read i know this this scripture is very familiar to all of us and we've been taught with these what these things mean and you know what the kind of the the context of what this is uh peter's trying to lay out is that that the holy ghost the the the one that's given us the divine power the one that's made a way for us to to to be partakers of his divine nature has made a way the holy ghost the holy ghost is the one that's building a living tabernacle and the holy ghost is the one that's doing it so i want to i want to i want to make it maybe take a title for tonight's sermon as the holy ghost did it the holy ghost is the one that's doing it and we can have confidence if you know that the holy ghost has done something in your life then you know you can have confidence knowing that it's not something that you did not something that you manufactured not something that you put on if you look back in your life and see how god has brought you from here to here and you know that it's not something that you just said in a reading room or whatever and you're reciting some good scriptures or something but you know that the holy ghost is the one that has done it the holy ghost is the one that's building a living tabernacle the holy ghost works in such a way he does it in such a way that no man can take glory i i think that's such an amazing thing that the holy ghost does it is that when you come to church and you know a lot of people give glory to the minister or they'll give glory to themselves a lot of times where they want to put some somebody up in a high place but god will share his glory with no man and so he does it in a way that nobody else can get glory because the product that he the thing that he the result of of his action is something that you cannot look at and say well a man has done it uh the only the only way that it could be produced is is if god himself has come on the scene and does it and what he does is he takes he takes men and women that are caged up that are imprisoned from out in the world all bound up with the with the world and the lust of the world and the pride of life and things and he takes men and women like that off the off the side of the road as you say like rahab and all the all the ones that we know of in the old testament and and all through the bible as as illustrations and he takes those kind of people and he changes them and he changes them and makes them a tabernacle of the living god so you look you look and see what god has done at your own life and see what god has done in the church and you know that it's got to be the holy ghost that's done it now brother when he was preaching the statue of a perfect man he he began with an illustration of how he went to the zoo and he would look at all the animals in the zoo and he would think that these animals are caged up in the zoo and they ain't supposed to be caged up they're not supposed to be behind those bars and he said he said i go to the zoo and see them poor old animals and bears and lions and things walking back and forth prison for life you see makes you feel bad after all they're captured by the intelligence of a man who is smarter than they are and you see what he's trying to do he's trying to illustrate that those animals that he looks that he looked at when he went to the zoo that's just like people that they would be bound up and captured by somebody that's told them alive maybe somebody we're all like sheep and we need we nee we need a shepherd maybe somebody's told them a lie that's got them all bound up maybe the devil's told them a lie where they can't get free that they can't be loosed from the situation that they're in told them a lot you know the devil many times will tell christians that it don't matter that if you make a mistake as a christian that god won't let you repent that you can't come back and those you see those things are lies of the devil that will bind people and it keeps you in captivity and brother branham he was looking at those animals in the zoo maybe came across an eagle behind the bars and chained up and he and he looked at that situation and it it's not supposed to be that way he said they'd capture them and put them in captivity and he said i think about the devil does that he takes precious people who should roam god's great places and fields and things like that then put him in a prison house of some denomination or some creed or something and buying them up in there and what a horrible thing that is what a horrible thing for for a beautiful tiger with his stripes to be behind bars when he's supposed to be out on the savannah or in the jungle or whatever what about an eagle that's bound up where he can't fly away and he he said a horrible thing a horrible thing to see any anybody that's bound by any device of satan and it's a horrible thing to see a young person bound up by drugs or to see an old person bound up by jealousy or enmity or pride or lust it's a it's a it's a horrible thing to see a preacher that's bound up by false doctrine but i believe we've got the antidote he said and the eagle stirth up her nest he said i went down there and sat down there i couldn't keep from crying then something said to me he said you've seen worse than that to see men who's born to be sons of god shackled down by creeds and denominations and people that says the days of miracles has passed when he's actually born to be an eagle to fly in the lights of the heaven yonder brother under the power and supernatural strength of god to walk by faith and not by sight you see what he's saying that's the kind of person you're supposed to be that's the kind of believer you're supposed to be somebody that uh you're supposed to be like an eagle that can soar in the heights that can understand the the mysteries of god they could the soar in the heavenlies he said you were born to be an eagle to fly in the likes of the heaven yonder brother under the power and supernatural strength of god to walk by faith and not by sight do you realize this is actually who peter's talking to peter is talking to somebody who has heard the gospel to loose you from your bonds he's preaching to the people he's given them the recipe to come into the divine nature to just get swallowed up in christ and that's who he's talking to to somebody who's escaped the bonds of the devil he said you see this tabernacle brother said is not a holy ghost tabernacle let me let me go back he said you you when you go and study this uh the statue of a perfect man when the next sermon blasphemous names is where he he really he almost kind of adds some additional clarification to it and then in the blasphemous names he begins to talk about sister shepard's dream and in there he talks about how that uh she saw that dream of the rock box up at the top and there was a man up at the top who brother said with the the messenger of the age was pouring water into the into that rock rock box the messenger was pouring water and and and the man the man pouring water he said this is the this is the holy ghost and nothing will hold it and he said to see there's no such a thing as a holy church or holy organization the holy spirit can be preached in it but in there you find good and bad renegades and different and everything else so an organization will not hold that's why he was explaining that rock but it won't hold you can't hold the holy ghost in an organization bound up by by your creeds and your dog was bound bound by your idea he said you can't say we got it none of the rest of them has it no sir the holy spirit is poured out on individuals it's the individual in other words the holy that's that's the the main thing in my sermon this afternoon is the holy ghost is the thing that's doing it the holy ghost is the thing that will loose you from your denominational ideas and your your creeds and dogmas and the ideas that the devil is planted in your mind that you can't be delivered from your sin and he said this tabernacle is not a holy ghost tabernacle this tabernacle this building this building there's no such a thing individuals that come into this church is holy ghost tabernacles they are tabernacles that contain the holy ghost but not the church in the body a group therefore it runs out it runs out because you can't contain it by just a group of people or a denominational system or something but the holy ghost the intent of the holy ghost the purpose was to come and tabernacle himself in an individual and change that individual but it's the devil it's the devil that binds and imprisons you know so many times i think we kind of forget that it's the devil that do does the binding the it's not it's not people that that that are doing it so much it's the devil working in people and you know if you if a man were freed from a cage you would be so happy he was free you wouldn't go back and look at his life and say i remember all the scallywag stuff stuff you did we're so click quick to blame individuals for what the devil has done in their past even before they're saved and go back and say well look look at all the mistakes that you made look at all the things that you've done you know before you're before you're born again sinners sinners are going to sin sinners are going they're they're in sin but the devil is the one that's behind it all though you know the woman at the whale was probably a bad influence before she met jesus she was probably a bad influence to all the people that that she went around but one day she met jesus rahab on the wall maybe she maybe she wrecked a lot of homes before she met the spies before the spies came with their message but one day she met the spies and she heard a message of deliverance and she hung that scarlet cord outside on the wall and something in her life was changed you know paul was a murderer and calls many to blaspheme the bible says he had a lot of marks against him but one one day he saw the light on the road and after you've met jesus after something after the holy ghost has changed your life the bible says in romans chapter 8 verse 33 who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justifieth it's god that justifies you a justification that comes with a new birth when nobody can look at you and hold anything against you because you've been justified justified by the life of god coming in you and making your soul clean justified so that nothing can be held against you we should be the happiest people on the face of the earth that we've heard the word and it's made us clean on the inside now brother brown said we are unworthy we're talking talking about the you see it's not something we can do it's something that only the holy ghost can do he said we're unworthy he said there's nothing good about us and we're all in one big jailhouse no matter what corner we stand in we're still all in jail one could not help the other now you see if one can't help the other then we can't we have nothing to boast of we have nothing to be prideful of that would say to say look what i did look look at the great thing that i have done but god brother brown said and his infinite mercy came down and opened the prison doors to set us free and he said we're no longer caged up now we're not in the zoo of the world but now we are free we're outside and who did it it wasn't us that did it it was the holy ghost it didn't i didn't do it and you didn't do it he did it all brother brown said sin made the great blockade and now sin has been took away by the blood of jesus now we are bound for the promised land by the promise of god which is eternal and that's who peter's talking to peter's talking to somebody who's been set free who's escaped the bonds of the earth of the world of the world systems who's escaped the pride of life and the lust of the flesh who's not going around bound by alcoholism and drugs and uh just jealousy and enmity but you've been set free because you've received the word and as simon peter said he said simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ and he said in verse 4 whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be made you might be partakers of the divine nature having what having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust you know you can look in the news and look in the papers and look out in the world and see all the stuff that's gripping the world and we should be so thankful that we've escaped out of that even though we're in the world we're not of the world even though we're living here we've escaped out of that stuff to them that have obtained like precious faith because the whole thing is based on faith he's saying that i have obtained this faith and i'm addressing this to them that has obtained the like precious faith it's not to the outside world this is to the church those that are in christ he said we have escaped he's telling us those who have escaped he's trying to tell those who who have escaped how to be more like christ how to be more like christ now the way he explained it in the statue of perfect man he said there's not there's not one person sitting here that doesn't want to be more like christ and he went through all the different ones in the in the congregation that we're getting the old and you know we've got many that are old here the sister cletus 95 that uh you know you know you can't the point he's trying to make is even though you're maybe oh way older than anybody else yet still yet still you still have that desire to draw closer and closer to god no matter what stage you are in life whether you're a minister a deacon whatever you are a little child every christian wants to be more like christ that should be your desire if you don't leave with anything else this afternoon go home and say i want to be more like jesus if there's anything else everything else pales in comparison than to be like jesus i want to be he said a christian wants to be swallowed up in him so swallowed up in christ until christ takes over and there's nothing left to me nothing left of myself but it's all crushed you know what the gospel message is a takeover message that god came down holy host came down and he's taken over the situation and now he said god wants to be so part god wants you to be so part of him so swallowed up by his love now if a christian wants to be swallowed up in him and god wants you to be so sp part of him so swallowed up by his love that you are one that you can't lose he wants that and you want it and now he's giving you the recipe he's unlocked the door so that you could have just be swallowed up in him and be one with him brother said excuse this expression i told my wife both getting old and i said to her do you love me like you used to she said i certainly do and i said you know i love you so much still i would like to take you and pull you inside of me so that we could just really be one more and he said now multiply that by a hundred million and then you'll find out that the believer who falls in love with christ wants to get into him because it's a love and here he's going to show us how that through these promises we might be partakers of christ's divine nature these mortal body how that we can be partakers i want to ask you this afternoon are you so in love with god that you want to fall you just want to be swallowed up by him are you so in love with god that coming to church matters more than anything that the world can throw at you it matters more than the family events that somebody and family is and your family is heaven on sunday that matters more than than anything they're doing at your school or something coming to church preeminates everything because you want god you want to be swallowed up in him so swallowed up in christ until he completes and completely takes over he said we've got to be so in love with him till when we ask for something and he doesn't give to us that doesn't shake us a bit and the only way you can do that is to become partakers of his divine nature then you'll understand the reason he can't give it to you so who's peter talking to he's talking to those that have escaped having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust escaped it say who is to now as to the church them who are in christ has been exalted above these things because when you escape you know brother in one place brother adam said when you're a sinner you're on your way down but when you when you're saved suddenly your trajectory changes and you begin going up why do you begin to go on up because the holy ghost is taking you up you can't help but go because he's taking you up and he's exalting you he's bringing you up and you can't exalt yourself the holy ghost brings you out and takes you up and positionally places not by man's power not by might but the holy ghost is the one doing it not you because you can't put yourself up that's why he said you can't add any of these virtues as much as you strain and try you can't add these virtues to it it's got to be something automatic something automatic that the holy ghost is doing that's why matthew chapter 23 verse 12 says who whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted now in that isn't that a paradox an odd thing seems like it's flipped on its head that you would think the way to get up would be to try to force and try to try to try to try to try to try to make something happen try to manufacture it but the way up is actually the way down to get as small and humble as you can so that god can actually work within you that's that's the way you preach the gospel is lord i can't do it i need you to come on the sea because it's the holy ghost that does it the holy ghost is the one that do it does it the holy ghost is the one that's living in you it seems to be exalted many times many times what god does is he'll actually bring you to a place where you get way way down before he'll empty you out you see he'll empty you out before he fills you up he'll come make you come through a place where you go through a dark dark valley maybe the valley of the shadow of death like and you're looking around at all the gloom and then you go through that time and you begin to realize that he is the same yesterday today and forever and you come out on the other side filled up now i i was listening you you think about think about david going going through all those times where he was out in the sheep code and nobody thought he was anything and he was the last of all his brothers and his father looked down on him and and god called him out of that so that he could fill him up and use him solomon that when it when he was made king he he got before the lord and he said he you remember that prayer that solomon prayed he said i don't even know how to go out or come in you think about humbleness homeless of mine and of spirit to say something like that i don't even know how to go out the door god i don't even know how to come in but god i pray that you'll collect it struck me give me something give me something from the spirit of god so that i know how to do so that i don't know how to leave these people job on the ash heap that said i it was on the ash sheep scraping his balls and he had lost everything but he said i know in my flesh that i'll see god you see how god will bring you down before he exalts you many times now now i was listening to that you might have seen that that testimony of the of the the brother in africa that's a prophet of the lord that brother joseph back there put on youtube and and if you go back and listen to his testimony he's telling he tells in his testimony about how that he was his family had kicked him out and and beside the road and he was having to he was having to uh he didn't have any food and he he was so hungry that what he would do was pray pray all night so that he would get tired and fall asleep and then we'd wake up again because his family had kicked him out his whole family wanted to murder him and and and he had a god gave him a vision if you go listen to that testimony god gave him a vision and the vision was god showed him in that vision first i'm going to empty you out and then i'm going to fill you up and you see that's that's scriptural because joseph was dumped in a well and left for nothing moses was emptied out in the wilderness but then then he saw the pillar of fire and god came and emptied it and filled him up so if you'll stay down low that is the way to be exalted you see many who seek to exalt or promote themselves if you want to promote yourself as something skewed in your thinking but if you get the holy ghost in your life the holy ghost will will show you the right way to go up and the right way to go up is to go down as far as you you know i was listening out in the yard sometimes i'll listen to sermons while i'm doing yard work and i got to i was listening through all the seals and i got to the fifth seal and i think it's i think it's that sermon and the first 15 minutes of that sermon brother branham was explaining how simple it is how simple and how god will go over the heads and the whole thing the whole gospel is about simplicity that's what so many people they miss the mystery of the seals because the seals are most of the time brother brown's talking it seems like he's talking about things that you already know but buried in there woman in there is a mystery that's hidden in there and it's hidden it's hidden from the wise and prudent but revealed and the babes such as we'll learn that's why the bible says i thank thee oh father lord of heaven and earth because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and has to reveal them unto babes if we'll just lower ourselves and get down so we can actually that's our problem so many times is we'll hear a message preached and we'll think within ourselves well i've already heard that and now is a good time for a nap we'll hear somebody preach a sermon like maybe maybe tonight preaching the statue of a perfect man and you'll think that i've already heard that sermon that's the same problem that we do when we listen to the seals because it sounds like he's saying something that we already know and that's why so many people have become confused they listen to it and they think well we already know what what is the mystery but if you listen to it and let the holy ghost reveal it to you something will begin to pop out of that message a mystery something god's saying something in simplicity because where's god hidden he's hidden in simplicity and revealing the same and what could be more simplicity what could be more simple than god hiding himself in the tabernacle of your flesh hiding himself in you what could be more simple than that you see we've escaped we've escaped and that's who that's who peter's talking to that's right people that people that have escaped you know that's one of the one of the evidences one of the reasons one of the ways that we we know something has been has been done in our lives that the holy ghost has had an effect because we can look back and see that we've escaped we can we've come out of something we've been changed and we can look back brother said that's how we know that we've passed from death unto life we look back to the pit we look back to the pit where we was healed from excuse me we're not what we want to be we're not even what we ought to be but one thing we're thankful for we're not what we used to be that's right we're on the road and we can look back and we can see where we came from do you remember that story in the book of acts where peter peter was down in the jail cell and he was it he was peter was in the jail cell and and he he was imprisoned he was a prisoner and he was down in the jail cell and and all of a sudden the angel came to him and began to escort him out of the jail cell and began to open up the doors and he found himself on the outside and he came to himself and he looked back and he began to realize that he wasn't where he wasn't where he came from the bible says that when peter was come to himself he said now i know of assurity that the lord has sent his angel and has delivered me out of the hand of herod and from all the expectation of the people of the jews now can't we say that when we look back and we see now i know for surety that it was the holy ghost in my life that did it now i know for sure because i can look back and i can see the jail cell the place where i came from something in my life has been changed the holy ghost the holy ghost is the one that did it you know i'm i'm so glad that i had nothing to do with it nothing to boast of aren't you glad that you had nothing to do with it it was all the holy ghost nothing to crow about i know it was him and him alone now that's the type of person that he's talking to the type of person that peter is talking to as the person that can look back and see where they come from that they come out of so they come out of the jail cell and they're on the road the person that has escaped these things see the corruption of the world besides escaping the world peter's saying besides escaping the world let's just get swallowed up in christ that's why he says and beside this giving all diligence add unto your faith virtue and divert you knowledge and the knowledge temperance to temperance patience to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity how how we gonna do that the way seems all sealed up but faith faith is the way that it is faith is the thing that unlocks the door now brother baby said the key is faith the faith holds the key and the key is the scripture and christ is the door see so it's faith holds the key that unlocks christ to the people unlocks it reveals it so you see you know peter peter was peter was sent to unlock the supernatural to the three groups of people to ham shem and japeth to the gentiles jews and the samaritans so peter was sent to preach a message that would unlock the supernatural them and here he's unlocking the way to get swallowed up in the divine nature unlock well see if you don't know if you don't know that you need these things then you don't you can't even approach to it but when it begins to be preached something begins to unlock when the word is going over the pulpit when the word is received in your heart something begins to unlock something begins to move and and so that's why that's why the gospel is actually a message to open up something to lose something he said so that so today we're going to try to take that same key to unlock the way to become a virtuous christian and the stature of god that and be a living tabernacle for the living god to dwell in now now he takes a quick detour here he said now after we get through with the seven seals at that time of the sounding of the seventh seal now we're talking about loosening up loosen something he said oh the loosening course we know what a seal is is to loose the ministry to lose seven seals to loose the ministry to actually give something in the hands of the ministry so they have something to preach something to preach so that they so that the door is unlocked for the people and he said we'll see that right on the chart as losing a message losing a message something that's sealed up so now i believe that the message has been loosed it's been opened up so that we can preach it so that we can proclaim it he said the way of escape has been loosed that the way to the divine nature has been loosed the way to a body change has been loosed the ministry has been loose see see now we've got something to preach because all these things have been loosed the gospel has been loosed and now the way to to being swallowed up in the divine nature has been loosed in matthew 16 19 it says i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven and how do you lose something now how are you buying something by the preaching of the word the word is actually what will loose the captive from his change so what do you mean loose from something loose from realize thinking that you don't have a purpose in this life thinking that that the promises of god are not true but when you hear the gospel preached it actually looses you from the captivity that the devil has over your mind now you know that god has made you for a purpose and that purpose is to manifest deity and i believe that's that's the message that has been loosed to to bring to the people a message that god's purpose for you is actually to manifest deity to actually manifest god to tabernacle god in your flesh he said now remember god reveals himself in three ways first time he revealed himself in a pillar of fire that was called the fatherhood then that same god made manifest in jesus christ which he built a body made this body thirdly through the death of that body he sanctified a church that he can dwell in it was god above us god with us god in us the same god what is it god condescending to his creation god wants to be worshiped the word god means object of worship and it's god trying to condition his people so he can get from them what he created them for he never made you to be something else besides a son and daughter of god do you realize that's actually the secret to depression many people talk about how they're all wound up with depression but even a psychologist will tell you that if you want to get rid of your depression to find some purpose yeah i've heard psychologists say before that you know if you're depressed then start cleaning your room and if you start cleaning your room then you'll begin to find purpose well god has given us a purpose and that'll that that purpose is that purpose is the thing that will loose you to realize that god if he can get get from you what he created for you and he never made you to be something else besides the son and daughter of god that's actually what he made he said know how that god is in his church the church is now supposed to be taking the place of of christ carrying on his ministry so your purpose in life is actually to carry on the ministry of jesus christ that god himself could tabernacle himself in you now in acts chapter 7 verse 48 47-48 it says but solomon built him a house howbeit the most high dwelleth not in tabernacles made with hands i saith the prophet heaven is my throne and earth is my foot so what house will you build me seth the lord or what is the place of my rest what house because he doesn't want just a house that you build but he wants to actually live in you that's what he that's what god's purpose is to tabernacle himself in you and in hebrews 10 4 5 it says for it's not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body has now prepared me a body a body that he could live in a tabernacle himself in he prepared the body of jesus christ that he could come and live in and tabernacle himself in and now he wants to live in your body a body has now prepared me god dwells in the statute of a man reflecting himself into that being he wants to dwell in a man he wants to walk in in your feet he said god has always at all time reflected himself in man god and moses somebody born in time of persecution of children a lawgiver god reflecting himself joseph born a spiritual boy among a bunch of brethren see all these different things that god reflecting himself that's god's great plan and purpose is to actually tabernacle himself inside you and use him to manifest his deity and he said since that time he has reflected himself in his church this side of calvary so you see we're all trying to get to this dwelling place the tabernacle of the living god that's all where we're trying to get to to be swallowed up in him just so that god can christ can just take us over now peter is outlining something here for us that how to get here now see brother brown begins to explain in the message he says now some people some people who have a portion of all these virtues they got a portion of all these things that don't even profess to be a christian because just just from your natural birth just from coming into the world from your natural mama and daddy there's people that are a little bit more patient than other people there's people that have a strength to them and and all these there's people that know that are good in school and they can accumulate knowledge and they know a lot of things but that won't do it some people are naturally patient they know a lot of information they got good good common sense they can give advice they've kind of got natural wisdom but you see that won't do it and a lot of times we'll take that instead of the real thing we'll try to we'll try to take the thing that we've got from our natural birth and substitute it for the thing that what god wants to give us through the new birth but it's the holy ghost that does it it's the holy ghost that's doing it it's not something that we do it we're you see we're all we're talking about something that only the holy ghost can give a holy ghost life and a holy ghost tabernacle making a holy ghost man that's what we're talking about and peter's delivering this message to people that have escaped the world and and they've been born again and now they've escaped the life of god has been given unto him and now he's trying to tell you how to be so swallowed up in christ that god can have the preeminence in your life but religion is not enough religion ain't enough uh well so many times we'll we'll we'll you know early on in your maybe in your christian journey you'll go to the to the christian bookstore and you look at all the books they got on the wall and you'll think and you begin to pour through them and you know they're self-help books and books on to tell you how to how to have a better marriage and all those things and you begin to take all those detours but you really what you need is not all those books that are lying in the walls of the christian bookstore but to go back to the word of god and actually find actually dive into the word of god there is no substitute for the word of god that's what that man in sister shepherd's dream was pouring into that rock box was the word of god the actual living word and that's the thing that will change you because only the holy ghost will do it only the holy ghost can do it self-help books ain't enough uh religion ain't enough religion just trying to attack on some some nice bird feathers ain't enough brother ryan said see he compared he made four different comparisons he compared it to it's like a black bird trying to put peacock feathers now that's a bird trying to put another bird's feathers in it to look like that bird but it's real close cause it's birds it's not a it's not a a cow trying to put further feathers on his back it's something that's real close a bird a black bird trying to put peacock feathers in his wings to make him a peacock he only disgraces himself now now he goes to a tree it's like a sycamore tree trying to manufacture apples and now you got two trees it's not a mule trying to manufacture apples it's a tree trying to manufacture apples but it ain't an apple tree it's a sycamore tree and you see how close it is you can look real close and have a lot of religion and come to church and sit on the pew just like just next to somebody else who's also a tree also a bird also the genuine thing but the thing that matters is the holy ghost on the inside because if you've got the life on the inside the life of the apple tree is what makes the apples the life of the peacock is what makes the peacock feathers and all the imitation all the substituting won't do it the holy ghost is the only thing that can do it now i'm trying to preach i believe the message is a positive message and i'm preaching a positive message and i want you to look back those of you that got the new birth that have come a long way to look back in your life and remember where you came from so that your faith can be built up to know that it's the holy ghost that's doing it it wasn't you doing it all this time but it's the holy ghost doing it you know i know for many years this is a message that can be preached in a lot of different ways and many times it might have been appropriate to preach the statute for perfect man in a way that maybe pushes you down and causes you to come to a place where you know you need to repent but i believe now you know you hear after after that message the brother preached on sunday the bride is coming to a place where she's coming to a place where she begins to speak and i believe it's time to look back and have confidence that it was the holy ghost doing it all this time and he said the next comparison was a four-legged animal he said it's like a mule trying to manufacture wool a mule trying to trying to act like a sheep not a mule trying to act like a bird but a mule trying to act like a sheep and the other one example was another bird he said or a vulture trying to eat with a dove a vulture that ain't got what it takes to digest right that ain't got what it takes to eat the things that the dove's eating a vulture sitting up in the church and saying yeah i understand all the things but he don't know what the dove knows because he can't stomach it you see how close it is a bird and a bird a tree and a tree a mule or a a four-legged animal and a sheep it's so close but you got to have the thing down on the inside and that thing is the holy ghost because that's the only thing that's going to change you that's the only thing that's going to carry you through it might look close but we don't want close we don't walk close church we want the real thing we want the genuine thing and i believe that the real thing is available how do we know that the real thing is available because the seals have been opened and the seals open up loose the message that can be preached a message that the real thing is available the real thing is here if you'll just open up your heart and believe it it gets sincere with god get serious about it the real thing is available the weight of the real thing has been loosed you see now we've got access revelation chapter 4 talks about a door open in heaven and i believe the door is open so that we can go through it now it's been opened up so that we have a way to access us access the supernatural access of faith that will change our bodies access of faith that will take us out of here and the real thing is the real thing is resting on it not manufactured the sheep doesn't manufacture he's got he's he has wool because he's a sheep a lot of people try to say well i'll try to get good i'll try to get good i'll try to do this don't manufacture nothing no you can't do it these are brothers words he said no you can't do it you cannot manufacture something listen if you bound up by depression if you're bound up by pornography you cannot do it you cannot loose yourself just by trying and straining real hard but let the word of god be received in a penitent heart and something will begin to work the holy ghost will begin to take action he said a sheep doesn't is an ass isn't expected to manufacture wool it bears wool and it does it because it's a sheep and when you're a christian you just bear the fruit of the spirit you don't manufacture it you don't try to make it up don't make yourself something that you're not you just become what you're supposed to be and then it takes care of itself you know what manufacturing is when you when you come to church and you're around other believers and you begin to say i i better do this i better act this way i better not say this i better i better not do that i gotta manufacture it i better i better have virtue i better have some knowledge i better have some godliness how are you gonna get godliness by trying to pump it up trying to manufacture it but if there's the thing the real thing the holy ghost down on the inside it comes out naturally it just comes out like the lily through the mud the nearly beginning it germinates and begins to grow and it's surrounded by mud it's surrounded by the filth of the world the quagmire of the world but it begins to put you up and come out and all you can do to stop it is still coming out why because listen when you're born again your trajectory has changed from down to up you're going up but only the holy ghost can do it it's innate it's inborn that's why you've got to be born again because when you're born again it's just part of you it's just down on the inside just doing it not religion but everybody said well brother brown i know this certain woman over here why she never did do anything wrong she's a good woman well this such is such a man he's a good man he never does anything you know he doesn't harm anybody that's why i've told i've told my kids be careful who you're married cause you don't want somebody that's just good be careful how you raise your kids because you don't want to raise your kids just so that they're goody two-shoes but you want to raise them so that they are saved because a goody two-shoe a goodie two-shoe it doesn't do no good it's just religion it won't do nothing it won't you can't add these virtues just to a goodie to you he said do you look at anything he's talking about a christian that ain't born again you look at anything say i just don't see it and you don't understand it a man can't understand why people shout a man can't understand why a human being's language would change and he'd speak in tongues the natural man can't see how a glory of god would ever come over a man's eyes and he see vision and tell man of certain things but when you're born again you can begin to see you can begin to understand why the gospel makes somebody happy why people want to come to church why you want to get around christians you begin to understand because something in your life has begun to change the holy ghost is the one that does it he's the one that does the changing he's changing your nature he's changing your thinking he's changing your walk and he's changing your talk he's changing everything about you so that you just get swallowed up in the divine nature and faith is the foundation that's why you got to be born again he said when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith so you see on my chart here he said i got the very foundation faith is the foundation of all of it being born again now listen you know there's like little nuggets in the message when you when you go combing through there's little things that you can just grab hold to and hang on now listen listen to this he says if you've got faith and he's talking about healing and he said therefore when you say brother branham i believe that god is a healer if you believe that and accept him as your healer and not lying but actually believing that his by stripes you are healed there's nothing going to turn you from it it's a settled thing now that's a weighty statement to have that if you got faith nothing is going to turn you from it let's say it like this if you've been born again i believe this will give you confidence this afternoon if you've been born again nothing is going to turn you from the truth nothing is going to turn you can never i believe this is the evidence you can never say i don't believe this message and leave it away because you can never be turned away from it you can never be twisted away from it because there's something on the inside that's more real than anything on the outside faith is the substance of things hoped for what kind of a substance is it it's a holy ghost substance a substance with some power in it some holding power faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen what kind of an evidence brother brown said he said a holy evidence a holy evidence that keeps you that keeps you from being turned away turned away by the things of this world it will keep you it'll keep you despite all the stuff they're putting on websites all this because you know that god is true it's a holy ghost substance a holy ghost evidence a holy ghost faith is what's been holding you oh holy ghost faith is what's been keeping you the holy ghost is what has done it and that's that's what gives you faith that's that's faith holy ghost faith whether you've been born again and god has given you his faith and placed that faith himself in your soul now you've got a faith that can believe without having to contact something where you don't need to go through a prayer line and have somebody lay hands on you you don't need to have somebody touch you but faith is the thing that it does distance does not matter is what brother ram said and he told that story of the centurion where he said i'm not worthy he told jesus i'm not worthy that you come under my roof just speak the word and what was it he said faith is the thing that closes the difference distance between the prayer that you ask and the god that's there to answer faith is the thing that connects faith changes things from here to here if distance doesn't matter circumstances don't matter all those things don't matter to faith so when he said when they make a phone call and say pray that contact and your faith brings god your faith brings god it's the thing that brings the prayer and god together on the scene prayer faith changes from here to here faith is the thing that changes from the person praying from the circle to the circumstance it's the thing that connect it brings it together all christianity all you are all you'll ever be is based upon faith in the word and that's what the reason i believe the word first you must be born again in other words get a foundation laid i know we're taking our time this afternoon i'm not going to hold you that long you know i know i know what y'all think when i when i say y'all like he got to go through all these virtues i'm not i'm not going to hold you too long but you got you got to you got to lay the foundation you remember that story brother i'm told of the sydney harbor bridge being laid and everybody said you can't lay a bridge there you can't stretch a spam between these two places but a man came on the scene and said i can do it how did he do it he got he got a blower and he blew all the sand under from underwear he was they were going to dig that bridge and he got down and he dug and he dug and he dug and he dug and he dug until he hit rock and when he hit the foundation then he was able to stretch the bridge and everybody said that bridge ain't going to stand everybody said that that ain't going to last this ain't going to stand but if you get the foundation right if you get the found in other words if you get born again then it'll stand the test and they drove all this long line of cars over the first day and everybody was standing around waiting to see that bridge fall but it stood the test now you compare that compare that going back over in the old testament where there was a man who who was going through some hard times by the name of jacob and it says in genesis 28 that he lied on a certain light it upon a certain place and tear it there all night because the sun was set and he took of the stones of that place and he and put them for his pillars in other words he laid his head on a stone he found a place where he could lay his head and rest he found a rock something solid and that night god gave him a vision and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of god ascending and descending on it he got a little glimpse of the way the path up to the divine nature of god but he laid his head on a stone and until you lay your head on the rock of the revelation of jesus christ you don't have a foundation that's why jesus said therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them i will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock whosoever heareth these sayings of mine that seems so simple it's so simple that you know many people overlook the simplicity of the the gospel is actually what will give you a foundation will give you the ability to escape the things i i wonder if people realized realize what what we come to church for that i think that's why the devil combats things in church he begins as soon as soon as you get to church you don't fall asleep during the singing you don't fall asleep on the drive to church but as soon as you get in the church the devil gets real mad because he knows that if you can get a revelation of jesus christ then you'll be an overcomer so what does he want to do he wants to put you to sleep that one time in your whole week that you should be you should be wide awake that you should be listening but that one time he'll he'll come over and he'll begin to sing a little lullaby in your ear or whatever's happening and he'll before long you you'll be in the arms of morpheus and missing out missing out may be on the thing that will give you overcoming power in this hour and see and then if you don't hear it in church where are you going to hear it you got to go study it out for yourself and pour over scriptures and ponder and things but we come to church to get edified we come to church to get the sword laid in our hands so we have something to fight with so we have something to pick our way out of the eggshell with [Applause] you know a little chick in his shell i doubt he's sleeping too much when it comes time for it to get out of that shell but it's like i gotta get out of here and it begins to get desperate it begins to know recognize where his help is gonna come from from that little mouth it begins to speak so what's the foundation of christianity faith in the word of god and everything is based on faith that's your foundation first pour your foundation faith that's the same thing in life that's why you know you tell you tell young people before you get married make sure your foundations you don't want to have a a bank account that the wind's blowing through you want to have a foundation you know you you want to have some things squared away because the foundation is important you don't want to just jump into life without many people do and you'll have that but but yet they're bound for trouble because because if you don't have the foundation laid square you any and everything both natural and spiritual lay the foundation first faith in the word of god that's your foundation then you begin to grow you begin to add to this foundation now let's go through these virtues real quick virtue virtue is the first thing you add and and brother brown said he quoted luke 6 9 and the whole merchant who sought to touch him for there went virtue out of him it went out of him if it went out of him it's got to go out of us and what is virtue strength or power in other words something on the inside that's holding you up something on the inside because the holy ghost is the thing that's doing it and so he said the virtue is as a past to let to let it pass out to others so that others can come and smell the odor can sniff and again get a benefit can be around you like like he said if if somebody comes around and they they look at somebody that says i'm a christian but yeah you're going around and doing things that you shouldn't you'll get funds no no funds available no virtue available because there's no power behind it no strength behind it no power no power of a life of a life of the life of christ behind it and there's i believe that there's power in the church today jesus gave us power power to cast out devils power power for a young holy ghost filled man that when he sees a woman maybe on the subway or something that's dressed scaly clad power for him to turn his head power for him to look for for a young man or a woman to look at to bypass things of the world to not go in the red dot store not go in the pornography store to to bypass because there's power in you power to live a christian life power to preach the gospel power to give somebody something that you've got and what what do you have that you can give somebody else you can give them the word because the word is the power that you've got that gives strength to somebody else power to live a christian life power to turn your head power to believe in miracles power to cast out devils you say brother said well that was a day from past we don't have it that means you don't have no virtue if you don't believe that that this miracle that the days of miracles are still here then there's there's no virtue you got something to give out and then he said you add knowledge knowledge now that don't mean worldly knowledge because that's foolishness to god but knowledge to judge judge what right from home in other words it ain't just information where you go into a self-help store and you just pile on it for a lot of people today they like information but this is this is holy ghost knowledge holy ghost virtue holy ghost faith and holy ghost knowledge to give you a revelation of the things that you've read the things that many people just look at you know the bible says that many many in second timothy it says ever learning ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth so a lot of learning is not what does it but learning receiving a revelation from god something that the holy ghost has given to you and brother said you must believe it this way you should believe today and accept it that the days of miracles has not passed to know that the days that miracles are acceptable to you knowledge that what god said god is able to perform knowing that he's still able to do it like abraham that yet against hope he believed in hope because he had knowledge that god was able to keep everything that he promised and where does knowledge come from knowledge comes from you eating the word until precept upon precept is added line up online until it's quickened to you and you know that god is the same yesterday today and forever and you know that all the hogwash they're saying on the internet about brother branham don't my mouth to a hill of beans because you know god because it came from the holy ghost it's not something that it's not you don't have a lot of information you you can't fight all the things that they're saying with a lot of information that's what people try to do they try to make videos full of information but what we need is a revelation of jesus christ when you see that the scripture is not contradictory that you can say that and see that by the revelation of god the whole word is wrote in mysteries and only the knowledge of god can reveal it that when you get and say punctuate every word of god with an amen then add that to your faith and then add temperance and tempers is the holy ghost in control the holy ghost to control at the beat so that when somebody slaps you or somebody says something wrong to you the holy oast is the one in control brother said how to control your tongue not be a tattler how to control your temper not fly off every time anybody speaks cross to you old temperance how to answer in kindness when wrath has spoke to you he said you're a bunch of holy rollers out there don't jump out and roll up your sleeves now see not that control he said now if you got it like that add it to your faith if you still blow up and sass and fuss and stew and carry on you ain't got no tempers if somebody somebody says something crossed to you and you just turn red in the face and your veins busting out in your neck you know there's something else that's got to be added but don't try to manufacture it but let the holy ghost do it because the holy ghost is the only thing that can change then after you've added tempers then after that add patience to your faith knowing this james said that the trying of your faith works with patience first thing is have patience with god and brother adam explained it like this the two things patience patience with god have patience with one another patience with god to know that if he said something he will bring it to pass patience like abraham waiting for him to bring that that promised son on the scene resting and waiting on god because you know that his word is true because it all comes from faith it's faith welling up on the inside coming up coming out knowing that god faith believed in god's word and if he said it he's going to bring it to pass and what kind of patience should we have in this hour with after all this time after all these years and it looks like he's delaying his coming but yet we have patience because we know that he's going to come and catch his waiting bride away say how well i asked him last night to heal me and i'm just as sick this morning oh my what patience noah waited patiently moses waited patiently when he threw that rod down and the other two fakers came up and they threw their rods down and brother said that typed jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever that heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away moses standing there with confidence and patience believing we've got to have patience like that patience not not something we manufacture but holy ghost patience he said wait at all this time for a resurrection there'll be one don't worry god promised it and we should have patience with one another too and now now after you've got patience add godliness and what does godliness mean means to be like god you got way up here now before you're asked to do that all these things has to be added first he's asked to be perfect god in us sons and daughters of god in other words all the things that are after all the characteristics of god are wrapped up in your life and so when somebody strikes you in the face because you've got godliness this manifest in your life and you turn the other cheek he said ye are gods jesus said so why all the virtue all the things that's in god is in you all the things that's in god all the things all those are in you and you're manifesting in the life of god and he quote in matthew 5 48 that says be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect that is it not written in your law john 10 34 i said ye are gods ye are gods that have the words come to you so if ye are gods it's because godliness is manifested in you godly always looking for one thing always looking for one thing i always do that which pleases the father see yes sir always that's godliness godliness is to always do that which pleases the father and then sixth let's add the bible said here brotherly kindness brotherly kindness now after you've got godliness now look through your brother's eyes put your plus self in his place look that when he does something that you don't like or maybe maybe he doesn't come to the company go out to eat with you or put all the different things in place well maybe he gets sick or whatever you begin to put yourself in his place and look through his eyes put brother baby said put yourself at his place on the matter have patience with him have patience with him and deal with him brotherly kindness you see a brother is all out of tune don't be impatient with him be kind to him go anyhow hoping someday being patient with and enduring with him to understand what he believes it's in his heart that's what is virtue in yourself to let it go out with kindness meekness to him having faith that someday god will bring him in remembering in his heart he is a believer now there's brotherly kindness when somebody makes a little slip up or whatever you remember that's a believer that's my brother and you're looking at that brother differently now because you're not looking at him knowing that that's a believer it's not not just somebody out there on the street or something that's my brother that's my brother or sister and you begin to treat that brother or sister differently because you know you know you're you're part of the same body you're part of the same family you're part of the same family of god it don't matter what their skin color is or where they come from where their background was what kind of life they had they might have been like rahab or whatever but that's your brother and you love them brotherly kindness the holy ghost is what does it mean the holy ghost is what changes the holy ghost is the only thing that can make you look like look at somebody like that where you begin to ignore over like the bible says love is what covers over a multitude of sins love is the thing that covers love love just kind of bypass when somebody wrongs you you begin to look through eyes of love brother i'm said feeling for your brother and he said if what is supposed to the church what is purpose to the church the life that was in christ isn't reflected in you don't you stand still if you haven't got patience virtue all these things and temperance and things in godliness and brotherly kindness and all these things that's required of you no matter what you've done no matter how much you've shouted how many churches you've joined how many feathers you've penned into yourself don't do it wait till genuinely from your heart you can forgive till in your heart you have brotherly kindness no matter if they pull a handful of beard from one side you can turn the other cheek with sweetnessy until all those virtues no matter what they say to you do you realize what kind of a church it would be and i i speak positively i believe we're coming to a place like that i i believe like like the brother was preaching on sunday we're we're not preaching necessarily to what we look at but to what god's word says we are that's that's what we god made a way for it and i believe we're coming to a place where where where the devil won't know what to do with us do you realize what you would be if you come to that full stature of a church that where one individual is not trying to put themselves up above the other where people love one another despite all the offenses and things that that maybe come just because of life because of all the misunderstandings but you love one another and put up with one another and are patient and kind and he said you've never seen a sweeter kind or gentler person that's got all these virtues in him but it's what god requires god requires how does he require it why does he require it for what purpose so that we can get out of here that's why it's required it's required and there should be something yearning in your heart tonight i believe that you to be swallowed up with him knowing that it's not something that you can manufacture something that you can produce yourself but it's only by the holy ghost the holy ghost is the one that does it the holy ghost is the only way and now after all these things then we'll add charity after after that at charity and paul said i can have all understand all mysteries have all knowledge have all these things but yet without charity without love i am nothing and love is the thing that mixed in when you talk to somebody it's got to be in love makes everything win with love because love is that love is the holy ghost love is the holy ghost that's waves coming down that powers the whole thing drawing us up to the capstone he said it never was put on the pyramid they couldn't understand why the catholic stone was rejected the head christ but he said it will come someday it will come someday and i believe he was looking back then to look into the future but i believe now we're looking to a present tense why because it's been loosed it's been opened up the way is accessible the the the seals have been open and when the seals are open now the ministry has been loosed so that we can pre we've got something to preach and what are we preaching that god has come to tabernacle himself in you god the minister the musicians can come forward god has come god has made a way that god can tabernacle himself and you can can sow and develop you and swallow you up in himself until you don't even see you anymore and it's by the holy ghost it's what the holy ghost has done not we ourselves the holy ghost is the one that's done brother branham at the end of that sermon he said i pledged this morning to him with all my heart that by his help and by his grace i pray that i'll seek daily without ceasing until i feel every one of these requirements flowing in this little old stature of mine until i can be a manifestation of the living christ i wonder if that's our prayer this afternoon as we stand to our feet i wonder if that's your prayer this afternoon would you just signify disobey the laws of gravity by lifting up your hand and say that's my desire tonight lord god i want to be so swallowed up in you until the holy ghost is filling me with every one of these virtues so that i can be a living eye to a living
