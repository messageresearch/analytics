Revelations 1 Romans 8 we had a real good time at what's not service so that's right I pray that the Lord will bless us to continue on because we're in a brand new year and you know maybe one of these days it'll be enough time run out out to where that they'll quit making dates and times and Seasons out of it and people will get down to reality but you know thank God for the truth remember now the Bible study will be not it'll be next it'll be this coming Saturday which is the second Saturday of this month all right cuz it's generally the first Saturday all right but it'll be at 6:00 and remember the ministers meeting will be at 11:00 you know so to the minister if you want to come and be with us and then remember the fellowship meeting will be at brother longor on the uh third Saturday so keep those things in mind and uh just pray I'm getting a little holler sound Jo so you may have to pull me up this morning I told where you better bring me some water cuz um my voice I like to lost it there the other night but uh it'll still be here I just preached too long that was the problem but I done it about 2 hours and a half I was trying to cut it down I I was shooting for 2 hours but it went a little bit further but we had a wonderful time enjoyed everything and all the food that everybody brought all the the gathering together and everything like that and uh they uh I hope you get to see the pictures of where brother Ray had his uh you got to pick on sister Brenda now that wouldn't me they had him a birthday cake and had him a cap and a little horn so you know everything was pretty good but we enjoyed it amen that's right Revelations 1 Romans 8 father we thank you for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for all things we thank you for your love and understanding and thank you for another year Lord a new day a new time everybody wants to end time or try to get away but Lord truly if we're here today then it's sure of one thing that we need the word revealed unto us and Lord we just ask you then to come and speak to us and let us not be down and out about the time because we read where the Prophet said that you were always right on time and there was nothing out of cater so it must mean that we're the ones that's out of cater Lord so you just help us in whatever it takes in this year to bring us to the place that we need to be then bring it on father and just let yourself be made manifest we love you and we we thank you as we read your word now you come and speak to our hearts and guide us now in Jesus name amen and we've been reading this for a while but we kind of Switched Off a title for La for watch not service and we'll use the same one today uh this will be part two cuz I want to make sure that we understand what I'm trying to bring of the making known of God and the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who bear record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that is saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand remember we preached the message on it what the time when the true revelation of Jesus Christ which is a revelation of the entire Bible is a revelation of Jesus Christ when that's made known then it's time to understand it's time to get out of here too okay Romans 8 we just read Verse 18 and 19 for I reckon that the sufferings of this present Day present time excuse me are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now there yeah go ahead and just put that up now we have to you that was not here on the watch Night Service we have some extra copies of the notes and things of the uh quotes that we used on the message there trying to bring out what we believe now I'm uh I told you I'm a little horse so just depend I mean just you know kind of help me by praying for me but uh you know don't clear your throat cuz I'll have enough trouble clearing mine and uh but we'll try to get into the word and I want to make sure that you understand what I'm talking about because I ventured into uh trying to explain there uh Friday night some things that I have mentioned along the way spoke a little bit about it but would back up and uh trying to wait to a time that uh you know that we could understand and I believe that now now Now's the Time to understand so you know we keep on going all right now we read here in the scriptures that the whole world is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God now that's plural that's not One Singular the world wasn't waiting for quote now just brother branam to come right the world is waiting on a manifestation of sons of God and we believe he was was a manifested Son of God all right now we believe that we believe that that God used him to speak to us right all right and we've tried to make oursel clear about where we stand that we are not looking for another Messenger to come amen if you are you better get to digging because time's running out and you're getting older you know why cuz I know that cuz I'm getting older I mean that's easy to understand so we need to get on with it if we're trying to find something else or or whatever and and do whatever because time is running out but now I I spoke many times along this line to to do it but I want to just make sure you understand this little Point what is manifestation see when you say that automatically people thinks of healing signs and wonders Miracles right because that's our human words and thoughts all right but how would that work out when uh well Jesus never come to make himself known that's what I was trying to get across Friday night he came to reveal the father or make known the father so the entire Bible now listen to the way I'm saying it please the entire Bible is the revelation of Jesus Christ all right I gave you a lot of quotes on that you should know where the Prophet said it all right now then I believe Jesus Christ is almighty God Amen all right now that's not Oneness we'll get to that in a minute to try to show the point that's not a Oneness Doctrine right Amen brother brand said I I don't agree with the Oneness right he said I believe in true Oneness amen that's right and I do too but I don't believe in the Oneness Doctrine but neither do I believe in the Trinity I was reading there one uh this morning where brother R said I I'm not a Oneness and he said I'm not a trinity he said I'm a Christian amen that's a good way of putting it wasn't good right amen you know he said I'm a Christian all right now see because we look at the Bible and try to comprehend and as I said Wednesday night I mean Friday night there then all we can use is words right that's right when you say the word Eternal you in your mind have made that something when really it is not anything because how could it be anything that be Eternal right amen it would have to be the Eternal God right but see when we make an eternity out of it we we're making it into human words we say it's like a circle it has no beginning and no ending you've made it a thought in your mind right because what you're trying to do is Express into words what your spiritual part of you sees right you agree amen see then what what we do is we take words and we we mess up things because immediately when you speak you mess it up but see Jesus didn't come to make himself known that's right and he to whom the son Matthew 11:25 through 27 he to whom the son will reveal amen now he come to reveal the father according to the prophet in the church age book that's 332 of the church age book that he didn't come to make known the son didn't come to make himself known he come to make the father known amen right now making known then did Jesus just come into the world doing signs and wonders no he became he came into the world preaching the gospel and God done the signs and wonders cuz he said I can do nothing right amen until the father shows me right he said what I see the father doing like I told you there the other night when we was on it that brother Brown said when that little woman he said now be it unto thee according to according to your understanding not according to your faith he said God didn't reveal to him that woman was healed right is what your Prophet said that's right amen he didn't reveal that that she was healed said Jesus told her to put it on her own faith right huh he said but then when Lazarus was raised he said that was a different thing because he'd seen a vision he know exactly what is going to take place that's right see because that's that's what it's got to be but he never came to make Jesus never came to make himself known right he came to make it make the father known right that's why to me then the prophet would say that it's a complete Revelation and listen I I look up everything back in on brother said a complete revelation of Jesus he uses those eight times all right but it's about 30 something times 20 something times that he says that the Bible is the revelation of Jesus Christ right all right now so it is a revelation of Jesus amen that's fine like I said the other night about it some of you caught it started laughing CU you seen what I saying you know about the things where the prophets said that Moses wrote five books yep right and these two quotes where brother R said Moses wrote four books well you know what Moses wrote four books and Moses wrote five books that's s amen I don't need a revelation does he he wasn't saying it was just four and it was five and he's changing his mind those are not contradiction those are just statements of human people you before the day is over you will do the same thing and I will too because we'll say something that's really not correctly doing it all right but now if Jesus came to make the father known then who are we to make known amen that's right are we to make Jesus known and let him make God known no we're to make God known amen that's right okay and you're a prophet on the message of of manifested sons of God paragraph 22 he said what is making known he said what is manifestation he said make it known right see Jesus made God known that's right and God made him known right right that's simple is it right he made his father known he didn't come to make himself known he made his father known and the father made him known you said but now now brother Dale said you the way you talk a lot times I can't understand you cuz you say you believe in one God and then you say you believe in in in Father Son and Holy Ghost and bless you bless you you tell me how you believe it and put it together with the Bible That's Right am and the prophet's message that's as simple as I say it right all right see if Jesus Christ though was to make God known who are you and I to make known right and see that's what you see people of the message that they think of adoption is making them known adoption glorifies Jesus Christ and if it glorifies Jesus Christ it would have to be making Jesus Christ known now you understand what I say I said it over and over the other night when I say Jesus Christ I'm not talking about Jesus the flesh amen all right you understand I'm talking about Jesus Christ to me Jesus Christ was almighty God the flesh was a body that was created yes all right God lived in that body Soul and Spirit of almighty God lived in that body and that's not one this then right amen that's a true Revelation we'll get down to some more in a minute but now listen see God won't share his glory with no one that's right amen so you see people that are stuffed shirts you know and the things and and they think really the world can't operate without them and and we'll find out one of these days like a prophet said if you want to know how important you are he said stick your hand in a bucket of water and pull it back out and see if you can find a hole you know well if that's what we think about it see I've never tried to believe that hey you know boy I tell you what and God you going to have to leave me here till the Rapture comes now he doesn't have to leave me here cuz he'll raise up somebody to take over I've never been concerned about that part right but I was trying to get the point to you you know that God won't share his glory with nobody that's right amen now listen but what about this almighty God unveiled in 1964 brother brand says God is inviting us to share his glory that's right that's right that's right amen he's inviting us to share his glory you see you make statements brother Dale it confuses my mind no no I made a statement that showed your mind was already confused cuz you thought you had it figured out because he won't share his glory it is not the revealing when I preach about that the bride is part of the mystery and must be revealed I'm not talking about you and me that's right I'm talking about Jesus Christ that's revealed in you and me CU when I'm talking about God revealing himself that's exactly what I'm talking about right we read in Revelations 1 the Revelation that God give to Jesus to give to John and I told you that was the key of the entire Bible right amen shows you how the entire Bible was written the Revelation that God give to Jes what was that Revelation about about Jesus no it was only about his future work in the church right because the Revelation was of God it is about God Amen see you're making the Trinity out of it the Bible's not making it right it's a revelation that God give to Jesus the revelation of who about himself am to reveal to bring out he said well why didn't you say that a couple of weeks ago and it helped me to understand well see the Lord makes you wait until sometimes where it can get us in the right place where we can't understand right there amen see God wants to share his glory with us why because he wants to share his eternal life with us that's right and to manifest himself through us there's nobody in the world that believes in manifestation any greater than I do yeah amen but I also got the Bible what are we going to do you know that John the Baptist never done one Miracle not one amen goad did he make God known amen he certainly introduced him to the world Amen right the greatest the Bible says of the prophets was John the Baptist but they wouldn't one Miracle see we put our things on Miracle then when I start preaching like that Brother D don't believe in Miracle he don't believe manifestation but you see that's what I'm trying to do is to make my father known right that's all I've ever tried to do is to make him known listen to what brother Brown says on this one see I love to bring everything it's actually on the church age book you don't have the notes or nothing now so don't look for it how we long for that day when the Crooked roads will be straightened and we will be with him time Without End May that day hasten its appearance and may we hasten to obey his word and thereby prove our worthiness to share his glory that's right amen prove it by what we do how we stay with the word right I love the way brother around talks you know he he said one time talking about something he said you know God believes his own word well that's that's good Lees his own word because he said it all right but now get the point see we're come to try to make him known not ourselves known right now listen to what I'm saying all right cuz this is the way I just try to make everything blunt you know there's probably not a preacher hardly might be some coups now you know there are cops that try to make their themselves known now so we leave that benefit but the majority of all the preachers were be denominational preachers this message preachers or what if you ask them what would they do and they'd say I'm trying to make my father known well how can you do that when you teach a Trinity right that's how can you do that when you teach that God is Street person or something right you're not making God known you're making the devil known right come on what about the people of the message that say he wouldn't go till the River Jordan that's right are they making God known or the devil known which one it is it amen see you think it's not serious you think that I just pick on people about this that and the other but no that's right God will make you and I known if we'll make him known but he's not underbound to us because of who we are it's because of what we can believe right don't worry about it he'll make you manifest right cuz he's making himself known that's right that's what he come to do amen he come to to make himself known but how did he come that's the only thing I've ever tried to get you to see how did God condescend that's what I'm talking about Friday night how did he condescend he didn't step over as we were looking at it you know now this is added to it so that was the other part God dwelt Alone the self-existing Elohim amen now he just didn't empty this up and step over here and start trying to make make yourself manifest that's right I've tried my best to get you to see that leave that alone you think it's a beautiful drawing to where you can take this and oh God was back there and then he just comes over like a brother told me one time he he was showing me a a drawing this man had and he laid it down on the table and he said oh brother said look at that and it didn't take me but just about 2 seconds till I seen it wasn't right you know the drawing and I said my Lord man that thing ain't even scriptural he said but it's a beautiful drawing I said it didn't mean a thing to him right he still held on his beautiful drawing right you make a beautiful drawing and make a beautiful speech but it's your speech in the word right amen but what did God do what is your Prophet we had to go to him to be able to get what was before the world and showed you that there Friday night amen and it was probably a shock when I first made the quote to you that I said Revelations 1 says the Revelation that God give to Jesus to give to John S signified it by an Angel and I said turn over now I didn't do it but I said over in Genesis 1 you know what it says the Revelation that God give to Jesus right and sent it to his servant by an Angel to Moses right I so he sent it to who wrote Genesis said he wrote it I gave you the quote said he wrote it from inspiration it's easy to know what happened in Exodus Leviticus Numbers and Deuteronomy because Moses was living that and writing down what was taking place but Genesis he was writing about what happened before the world right you know and the world coming down he told you about when it wasn't even as a wrote out here see time wasn't counted in the garden until the fall right even though you got days and things but how many days you have 7 days or 7,000 years which one is it time wasn't counted right brother said Adam knew that his youth was being renewed right other words there was no age Factor there was no deterioration there was no days and times M until fall came into be right would you see then God the prophet said a little Halo of light came out he calls it the logos the theoy the Son of God Amen see when you say son of God people lock in 2,000 years ago Son of God Son of God was the first form of God that ever came into being into a human mind that could comprehend right that's it amen like I said about Moses he got it from God and wrote Genesis but he got it from the angel that met him at the burning bush that's what your Prophet said that's right which was the angel of the Covenant which was Jesus Christ right that wasn't Jesus At The Burning Bush but over in the book of Acts you'll find it talking about Jesus Christ and it said he was the one that spoke to Moses I think it's Act 7 I'm not certain do you see what I'm talking about yes see we think we understand but we don't understand God until he reveals it right amen there's no way to put it into human language right you can't bring into human language and eternal God that a human mind without the Holy Ghost can reveal it right am is that what the Bible said no man can call Jesus the Christ except what by the baptism of the Holy Ghost what your Prophet said the new birth y amen I sitting there in the woods listening the other day some questions and answer in Genesis you know how I've always taught it I said the new birth is what Father Son and Holy Ghost coming into you at one time the person of God right I sitting there a listen question and answer genes brother said you can't have the father without having a son he said you can't have the Holy Ghost without having father Son and Holy Ghost he said because it's the same person right amen how many persons you got well brother we don't have persons anymore we have identities well according to Webster identities is person yeah right and even people say well you know great man this message says why there's two persons of Jesus was a person and God was I wouldn't say that if I didn't hear it right sure did well see that's contrary to the prophet's message but you know what you got a big following they try to have him at somebody that can preach the truth well that's all right not no problem I preach to what God gives me to preach to right amen listen we were talking about see and we've been on it quite a while in the Book of Revelation the Revelation that God give to Jesus see to give it to John but it wasn't the revelation of himself or Jesus Christ you know as as that it was the revelation of what God was going to be doing do you understand right am well I read it say Revelation Jesus Christ how many gods you got then you got a revelation of God you got a revation Jesus I'm not trying to reveal two Gods I'm trying to reveal one true and living God that's right but his name is Lord Jesus Christ that's right one God well brother the hell you try to make it so so that we can't understand it's just simple it's just one God well that's what you believe the Baptist believe that you want to talk to them Baptist will fight you over where you tell them there's a Trinity right but when they get through like I said a minute ago a Baptist preacher get up and he said I'm only talking about my father trying to reveal him say Well who's your father well he's Father Son and the Holy Ghost Blessed Trinity but we believe one God did we according to John 1 your Prophet would say in the beginning was Elohim right and Elohim was with Elohim and then Elohim was made flesh and dwelt among us see he translated that word is on the unveiling of God he translated the word what back to where the original cuz he said Genesis 1 where it says God that means Elohim right Y and he self-existing right see the Bible is a complete revelation of Jesus Christ who is almighty God Amen that's right that's what I'm talking to you about well that sounds like Oneness well okay okay hold on a minute remember you're prophet and we gave it to you over and over and have for all of the years we've been preaching that what the Son of God is God in another form called a son that's right same God am same God is here self-existing is the same God here but what do we bring out brother BR say it was only a part of God that went out right mhm I know what he says he said he was all of God that's right cuz you took a spoonful of water out of the ocean and you got the same chemicals exactly of what it is in the whole ocean right but you only got it in the part you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the new birth right which is the person of Jesus Christ now I'm quoting brother R but do you have all of God right no but he did what's right cuz he didn't have all of God all of God wouldn't made manifest what he was doing until the River Jordan I agree with those Brothers on that that's when he become the prophet said the fullness of the godhead bodily cuz he couldn't die for you at at 3 years old he couldn't die for you at 12 years old he couldn't die right he couldn't make that manifest he could only make God manifest for the part that was being di right right but the River Jordan it was a fullness am all right see the son then is to make the father known how by bringing the father into view right okay right right by bringing the father into view not bringing the self into you right because it's not God is not many gods it's one God being revealed that's right now listen how many times do you need this that God has made manifest in what three attributes father son Holy Ghost amen all right now healer Redeemer savior Etc has to be tied up in that because you only have the three attributes of God Father Son and Holy Ghost that's what to be revealed to us here now there's parts of God that's not been revealed so you better leave that on the other side over there where I got the line that says eternity you better leave something there to be able where your Prophet would be right to where he said he'd give us the message of cheer right amen he said after the angels are gone and after we're over there he can give us a message of cheer right now if not what kind of a g I'm just honest I don't mean to be hateful I know God has to reveal it but what kind of a god do you have right like I said Friday night me I mean do you think God oh God's just a spirit well he was just floating around there wasn't nothing he's just floating around just no form no well brother R said God is a being right amen he's not like the wind I gave you that Friday night amen he said he's a person right he said he lives in heaven that's right he got a place to live don't you think he had a place to live before he created the world see we get over here and we try to make de you know something greater than what it is you mean this pullit I'm beating on wood is greater than the creator that created it that's right what kind of a god do you have am even the totem pole people believeing better than that they at least get them a totem pole set it up right but you see to me God before the world was God Amen I know what it means god is an object of worship and he wouldn't he made the angels and they worshiped him we know all the whole story right but who was he oh he's just a glob just floating around what kind of a God are you talking about that's right and what kind of a God are you going to see when you get over there oh I guess what we'll see is we'll see a Halo of light up here and a little Pillar of Fire over here little Dove over here and Jesus walking around well I don't believe that man I'm just honest I don't believe it that's right I believe we're going to see Jesus we're going to see him like he said yes he said if you seen me you've seen the father right that's who we're going to see amen yes sir but now before I get to the end of the message I hope I get there I want to make sure you understand one thing you realize that when we get there and see him he'll still have nail prints in his hands so when I get around to a minute in what I'm trying to bring out to you don't think that I'm doing away with anything I do not believe God does away with anything whatsoever whatever he was he still is and will always be or he's not Hebrews 13:8 in him was the attributes he never gained attributes when he come here he he displayed attributes when he came here that's right those attributes was in him sir but there was things about him he didn't tell us that's right he said wait just a minute where you get that from your Prophet they said we get a messenger Che down through the end ages right okay I got it from him because that's what I believe are we going to go up there and look around and say who Where's God no I believe we're going to see Jesus Christ amen yes and we're going to see him as he is amen standing right there in flesh amen that's right my brother D you just don't understand I've always believed God is a spirit and you're making it something thank you Father Hallelujah you mean what created you is not greater than you are that's right and see that's what I've tried to do right I've tried to get get to that point now you remember what the three attributes of God father son Holy Ghost now you remember the many times you want me to get them be glad to they're in the office of where Dr lza that was a Jew the brother R said he was a Jew he was the one who wrote the ls of Bible right okay and brother R said that that that LS of Bible was of he said there's no difference in Doctrine or anything than the King James right now that's that's not verbatim words it's close enough but now Dr lamza was shocked he seen the signs and the things that brother Brandon was doing right right he seen the Miracles the healings and the things but did that excite him I'm trying to get to where you'll see what make manifest make known is was he excited yes wonderful God Is With Us Glory Hallelujah brother brandom I believe maybe that you was a prophet great signs and wonders to man say well what happened to him one day he was sitting talking with the prophet and brother brandham he said uh you're not a Oneness brother brandham he said no I'm not a Oneness he said I believe in the three attributes of God three offices he said Dr Lomo said you mean like brother R said Father Son and Holy Ghost Dr Lonzo said brother brandom I believed you was a prophet now I know you are in other words he said because now do you know that that's the ancient symbol of one God in the Hebrew now I don't know what this line is you could draw it out any way you will make or whatever I don't know what they was talking about back there I probably have my own idea of a circle with parts and parts I don't know what the symbol I've never seen it maybe you have right but brother R brother Dr L said brother brandom that's the Hebrew symbol of one God he said now I know you're a prophet and he said prophets said one day you'll give your life for that he said because prophets always died for their belief brother Brown said Hallelujah I hope so right he saw three attributes brother random taught three attributes Father Son and Holy Ghost now then why can't we see three attributes with having without having to look at three persons or some kind of a way why can't we see that this eternal God that had all of these attributes in him he began to display attributes right and out of him went a pillar of fire out of him went the low go out of him went the Son of God now brother random said I do not not believe in Eternal sunship right that true right so he's not talking about eternal sunship whatever who this is right here that does all of this has to be Eternal right every who the Lo the the word the Son of God would have to be Eternal wait a minute now you're saying Son of God is eternal Prophet said well your prophets want have said he was sure did amen he said that's God in another form called a son God in another attribute in other words God in another revealing of itself a way that he could come down we can't understand the Eternal God right it's been 6,000 years trying to preach about what he's made in his word for us to understand right and the most confused people about the godhead is the people of this message amen that's right that's right don't back off at all the most confused people about the godhead I had a better understanding of one God and the Baptist Church right and the people of this message today's got cuz you see they won't take all brother around and say they only take part only take what they want right take it all brother R said he's all he's part of God he said he's all of God yep well how could he be part of God and be all of God the little spoonful of water out of the ocean is all there is in the ocean it's just in magnitude or you know amount it hadn't been displayed so can't you see that back before the world God just stepped over in another form right I got on it there Friday but I didn't finish it most of you have heard me anyway can't you just see God created the angels and things they were what he created first before he created the world that made him God that's why God is using Genesis one yep right now can't you see Satan standing up there thinking he's a great guy he's anointed Cher I'm the rightand man but I'm him anything go goes on around here I do it about that time a Halo of light steps out and goes over and he looks around he said who is that who is that cuz you see God didn't create another person no that's right Lucifer was a different person from God he was a created being brother R calls him a being so you go and do what you want to he said Satan is a being he was a created being but this one's not a created being that stepped out and began to create that's why he's the beginning of the creation of God Amen that's why I was trying to get you to see like w was bringing it out about you know that's there he was in Genesis 1 and Revelations 1 Genesis 2 Revelations 2 Genesis three in Revelations 3 you remember where he was bringing it out Revelation 3 is what Genesis 3 is what I'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman right the promise of the Messiah coming and what does it say in Revelation 3:14 right the beginning of the creation of God Amen cuz that's who it was back there that's who this was here brother R said God gave birth to his own son that's another person no amen he gave birth to himself that's in a way that we could begin to comprehend and what could the scholars call it that's right now come on we've used words Elohim is a word used by mankind to try to express an eternal God right cuz it's the best word they can use mhm like what is it Zoe means God's own life but then you can get down to other words that are close to that out now if I'm wrong correct me I sry I don't work I'm just trying to show you something you got like Eon it can mean a lesser way but Zoe means God's own life well that's the only word they could come up with and they everybody established it where it be Catholic Protestants Jews Hindu Muslim whatever everybody uses some kind of a word Express their God right but you see what we're trying to see is that God condescended then we can understand it right that if he did what did he do not another God God condescending right but he took the form of a son now watch that in a minute he took the form of a son to reveal himself right that's it that's why Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God Amen now who created like I said Friday the father didn't create it was the son that done the creating right you said no it was just the father in The see you're still trinitarian don't do that listen to where I say it the father didn't create he stepped over in another form yes but in that form he became a son that's the son is a Creator according to Hebrews 1 John 1 Colossians 1 James 3 I think it's James 3 and9 all things are created by Jesus Christ yep that's right that's why he could stand there upon the Earth and he said before Abraham was I am amen amen but listen I thought we believed in one God then why would we stumble over a prophet expressing it into human language right he didn't express it like a theologian now what would a theologian said on that that's why God didn't use none of them that's right they got too much sense right yep maybe n enough sense they got too much brain but he didn't use a theologian he didn't send a theologian in this last days the theologians will go back back here and and all you got your scof Fields you got everything come on take your Bible read it if you got a Scofield bible yeah take your Thompson chains and things it'll show you that the first form that went out of God was the son of God right sure abely called a Loos the that's what they knew but here comes a seventh grade education man yep that begin to confound the scholars by explaining to them like Dr lamzo was a he a Jew but he was also a scholar and he saw when brother brandson said he saw the signs and wonders he believed that he could see others right there praying for the sick and all he just seeting greater magnitude in this man right but when he turned around and he said Do you believe he said I believe in three attributes Father Son and Holy Ghost he said brother brandom he said now I know you're a prophet Y and you'll give your life for that belief you see but what you what people don't seem toget about me is they want to race this out and make a beautiful thing and R out make a beautiful thing right I thought we believed in restoring all things right see I didn't finish you think I 2 hours and a half I didn't get nothing started in what I was talking about that's right I thought we believ in restoring all things I thought restore meant to go back to where it originally came from y now you see I got a restored 55 forward you're lying like crazy quit doing it you can't have one you can have the parts of the 55 but you ain't restoring it why because the suckers done wore out the only way you could do that is it's for some way that had took one and set it aside and never moved it never done nothing to it put it in a bubble sealed it off and then you can walk up and say there's a restored 55 sh cuz you done wor to sucker out and you done put mileage on that ain't restoration right right and that's why I restore all things that's why if you and I don't have eternal life today we will not go back where we came from we we'll go back where we came from I the dust of the Earth right amen but if we have eternal life we can go back where we come from because that's what eternity mean your soul by the New Birth has already been taken back into eternity where it came from am thank you Jesus I'm not finished on the part of about God I'll get it one of these days see I believe all the things brother around says but sometimes it takes a while to wait till he reveals it amen that's right but see why can't we believe it we talk about partial realization right we say partial realization and perfect realization all right now Martin Luther with the baptism of the Holy Ghost right people say oh he didn't have it because they don't believe but brother Rand said he did said he had a new birth for his age right but compare that today won't bring you the new birth right it would then but it wouldn't won't do it now amen is that true yes right come on then can't you see that what Luther had was part but yet what he had was fullness for his age right partial realization y absolutely amen compared to perfect realization you got a piece of something that's a part of it that's right but it's just as real as all the rest of it that's right amen I thought we believed in that right see the logos that went out of God was a part of God and that part of God was a Son of God listen I wrote it like this see the life of Jesus Christ we see him as he is revealed and look at the life of Jesus Christ he's first revealed as a baby now I'm talking about Jesus the flesh all right right get out flesh flesh Jesus number one he's a baby he can't manifest all of God that's right he can't manifest God other than Christ he didn't know anything did he he had to learn didn't he the Bible said he learned right grew in Grace right amen number two at the age of about 12 somewhere the bar vit what you call that big old word somewhere in there he come up to word and he met the the scribes and Pharisees and he was the word right you agree talking to him but he couldn't die a savior amen that's right know there was part of God wouldn't die right y but yet he was all of God Amen that's right I don't understand that now you can be all God and party ask for a revelation said to River Jordan you see Jesus says he comes to a time to where he's recognized right as the Son of God that's right this is my son in whom I'm pleased to dwell in amen yep your Prophet C he becomes the fullness of the godhead bodily on the River Jordan y That's Right does he know everything no he didn't know the seals no he didn't know I mean the uh The Book of Revelation excuse me he didn't know the Book of Revelation because he come to John to tell him the things there that wasn't known as I was ustra it while ago he told the lady he said go be it according to your faith he didn't know about that all right he comes to man of transfiguration that's more of God cuz then it says this is my beloved Son in whom I pleased to dwell in here you him but see you know that ain't all of it right you said well he was the fullest he but that would all of it he had to die y to bring a resurrection y to prove who he was is that the words of the prophet in the resurrection he proved who he was right he said been many great men do this that and other but said when he raised he said that a lot of people die but said when he raised raed that then he proved who he was but you know that ain't all the Story come on he come back on the day of Pentecost in the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the bride amen right you know that ain't all the story amen I hope you're understanding how did it's part part part part right but each one of those part hearts at him into fullness right you and I got to be changed one day and taking over there now you're getting cycle completed right man all right you're getting over here where we talk about restore all things because that's got to be it now let me say this I'll just quit cuz I've tried to explain to you one God the best that I can by The Prophet's message by the Bible let me say it again then to where you won't misunderstand me where you believe it that's all right that that's God see we want to say all God was he poured into Christ right all Christ was we put the bridal here you know he poured into the church well now did you do away with God back there and to put it all in Christ did you do what with God where's the message of cheer that we get right amen can't you see there things about God has not been revealed to us in this world when we get there it's going to be a wonderful day to see God and realize who he is it's not going to be a reh hatching of all the things that we've already seen right amen it'll be an eternity partaking of a revelation of a living God that's right why I said he had attributes he didn't display but all the attributes he displayed was all he needed to display that's right well brother Dale I know it's probably about 60 times where brother said all God was he PED in Christ and all Christ he poured into the church yeah yep and it's eight times I think where he said all God was he P into Jesus and all Jesus B into the church I know that you know that's where I got the understanding from but you see the same Prophet told you they would be an eternal partaker K of a revelation amen that's right so then let's don't just race this out see let's just leave things alone amen and see that the self-existing Elohim you know what he's still in heaven that's right now old brother Dale he's inside my soul well like I said Friday night then you got a problem because the devil is talking to you where is he talking to you at is he in your soul got a problem right but you see all that God was going to be revealed now get what the prophet is saying all God was now when you say was it means you put a point to it Danny there was a day you and joy was married what does that mean I don't know what the date is so Danny can't have GE can but you know what that means that means there was a time there y so can't you see what your Prophet is trying to get us to see all God was all God was going to reveal to mankind come across a line of Eternity and begin ENT into a place that time wasn't counted or anything but he began to create and that was the Son of God the L go the very part of God now you going to have to watch me because I'm going to show you something the Lord willing naturally okay see then here's the word of God here's the Loos the theophany and that's come into Jesus Christ come into the flesh that's right oh God was right he poured into Jesus Christ right I thought the Bible said that that even the things that Jesus done that the world couldn't contain the things the books of the writings see we tried to exhaust something we use human terms okay but see now all Christ pours into a church does that do away with Jesus no does it do away with Jesus because he put on the day of Pentecost he put the baptism of the Holy Ghost into 120 people 3,000 the next time and for all of these 2,000 years he's been given the new birth you don't even understand brother Rand to say in the Bible to say that they took off of Moses and put it on the others and left Moses with no less power right every person there's over 7 billion people in the world today in every person in the world today could if they would receive the person of Jesus Christ and you know that would not exalt him that uh exalts him that would exalt him amen am because this has been the condescending of God to where he's actually taken and what's the word for it he he's beginning to expand himself amen that's right the church is the expanding of God that's right now see then restore all things means what somewhere in the world now I know I'm going to make a crooked drawing out of this or something but I probably done thr it away there it is now this ain't no good Circle but you see when this strikes here it's going to go here amen amen it's a complete circle right a complete circle right but it's got to be completed before it's a circle all right you said well why did you put all these over here because you see we come over here we get eternal life that restores the soul right the soul is eternal that's right if that Soul come from God right that's right I don't mind quoting it like that cuz see I'm not the two Soul people I'm quoting brother around am right I'm quoting the Bible Bible said All Souls are mine but you see we get eternal life all right now I should have put in here one more to make it correct cuz I said you try to draw and you're getting in problems I didn't spell it correct but that word is Millennium all right there you go now when is God going to be all in all let's read that scripture what is it in Corinthians somebody find it for me if I 15 Corinthians 7 what is it 15 yeah 1 Corinthians 15 yeah 1 Corinthians 15 20 2 right well you read it back up above there cuz we're running out of time all right let's go down to it let let's get it right let's start in verse at least verse 23 but every man in his own order Christ the first fruits afterward they that are Christ at his coming then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God now who's that talking about right Jesus Christ the son right that right amen delivered up the kingdom to God even the father when he shall have put down all Rule and all authority and power cuz all power is given into Jesus Christ and it's he's the one that's going to put down all this that's why Jesus Christ has to come riding back on the White Horse right right right with you and I into the Millennium Revelation 19 okay all right now watch he must reain till he hath put all enemies under his feet The Last Enemy that shall be destroyed is death all right now watch now death is not destroyed at the Millennium or before the Millennium that's right only death for certain people right amen which is the bride of Christ right and then you got your Jews coming up and things like that into the Millennium right okay but see they still death because you got the the white own judgment and then you got the Lake of Fire which is the the death and hell is cast into the Lake of Fire is to be destroyed okay so you got it Last Enemy that shall be destroyed his death for he ha put all things under his feet he God has put all things under he Jesus's feet Christ s right but when he saith almighty God sayith all things are put under Jesus Christ it is Manifest that he God is the one that's accepted see I've never caught that scripture I preached on it before you know that which did put all things under him who put all things under Jesus Christ right almighty god well now you're trinitarian okay now watch when all things shall be subdued unto him now we just read over here in verse 24 that he would deliver up the kingdom to God even the father okay and when he shall have subdued all he shall and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that God may be all in all right now for just a minute and you'll see what I've been driving that for 40 years I couldn't get it Friday night I couldn't finish all of it up see there's a time now you're going to have to listen and you're going to trick me with words and trap me so go ahead but you better listen if we don't believe in Eternal sunship if the prophet didn't believe in Eternal sunship there is some way that Prophet must bring us to the understanding by the Bible that the sunship not terminate like you think right it doesn't say that it says he will surrender now this is something I've never said to you publicly I've said it in roundabout ways for years cuz I've been waiting there's got to be a time when the sunship when be in existence to be used as a redeemer cuz sunship is Redeemer savior healer Etc is in sunship there'll be a Time come when you will not need to be saved you will not need to be healed you will not be need to be redeemed you will be redeemed amen all right so now the sunship is not going to go out of the way now so you go ahead it's not going out of the way cuz I know what people's minds will do what's tricking you words and in nowh in the world have I ever believed that it'll go out of the way I believe that when we step over there in eternity and we're going to get right here and see where it's coming we going to see Jesus Christ Y and we going to know who he is we're going to see him in know may I quote brother in the Millennium I don't have this I'll be glad to get it for you in the Millennium Jesus will lead us up on the mountain and bow down before the father and said Papa God if you had to come that's what your Prophet said so watch it in the Millennium only the bride will know him in the full Plan of Redemption because it's already taken place while we're here before the Millennium comes right she will see him as her husband right she will be brother dick the wife that rides back in the Book of Revelations that's right and she will see him as he is because she will be like him am I quoting scripture all right so now let's see what the prophet said thirsting for Life 1957 630 and Son means had a beginning amen so how could it how could it be an eternal godship excuse me how could it it it could be Eternal an eternal godship but never an eternal sunship a son is one that's begotten of so it had a be beginning the logos the word the Son of God the theophany at a beginning brother brandom how are you going to place all in all page 67 Christ of Myst of God reveal preach 1963 728 and at that day the kingdom be given over to the father is that what we read right you want to read it again is that what we we read over here in the scripture in in Corinthians did he give it up to the father let's read it where you hold on then cometh the end and he shall deliver up the kingdom to God even the Father which shall have put all power and Rule down right so listen to your Prophet at that day the kingdom be given over to the father he might be all in all while he's yet speaking I'll hear days of Christ you say well now how you going to place it David sitting on the throne the king over the whole human race now that's got to be the Millennium that David sits on the throne okay y now so the bride will see him in the Millennium and he'll lead us up the mountain and he'll bow down to worship too and he say papa if you had to come he said what are you talking about Jesus in the Millennium leading us up and praying exactly right cuz there's the key where it will come to a time and I'll get to it in just a second and I get page I gave it to you Friday night but I wonder how many paid attention right future home 1964 802 city with a mountain in the top y Revelation 2123 Y and they need no light for the Lamb of the Lord God is the light thereof see the Lord God is the pillar of fire that followed the children of Israel through the Wilderness and he has ascended upon the throne in that perfect Kingdom when time the kingdom that Jesus is to surrender to the father that God might be all in all now watching Jesus sits upon his throne here is our Joseph then the king is the light that will be on the top of the Mount Zion and His Holy Light will flood the entire city that's right so in the future home he'll deliver the kingdom he won't go out of existence or the father say well don't need you no more you gone no cuz that's what your mind tells you right that's right no way Amen Let eternity will make a circle and this eternal Elohim will be sitting there but who will it be amen according to your prophet and I just read to you Jesus will sit on the throne amen that's it why then because your mind will see that God is all in all the sunship will not be done away with because that Jesus to be sitting on the throne will have nail prints in his hands amen but then we'll see him as Jesus said if you seen me you seen the father absolutely amen that's one true and living God amen that's not Oneness and that's not Trinity amen you said well one this just one like your finger and ain't no more manifestations you you better consider what's draw out here because here's manifestation here's manifestation here's the bride of Christ all manifestation and one day the world will even be made Eternal right amen right that God may be all and all it's not the Sun going out of existence it's all of those attributes coming back all of those attributes he had over here must return to the right and his attributes with Father Son and Holy Ghost but the key is we'll see him as he is because we shall be like him now if you do away with sunship you're going to do away with you that's right right I thought we were believed we were the sons and daughters of God so I wouldn't do away with sunship if I was you right I would keep it and let it all be made manifest right back into the great Eternal God but then when you do and you see him standing there he won't be self-existing that's the one thing he will never be I gave you a quote the other night Friday night about it he will never be alone again right he'll never be self-existing he will be the one who exists with his attributes his children his offspring and you know there'll be people in heaven that or whatever you want to call it
