[0:00] could be in the house of the Lord
[0:04] we're on
[0:07] I know I took a step back and some of
[0:09] the scriptures we were almost to Hebrews
[0:11] 12 and I I backtracked just to kind of
[0:14] cover Perfection a little bit more
[0:16] and so we'll start reading from verse 39
[0:18] and 40 this morning
[0:22] come on
[0:24] [Applause]
[0:30] well that's a nice surprise this morning
[0:38] let's just go to the Lord in prayer
[0:39] before we read our scripture Lord we're
[0:41] so grateful this morning to you for all
[0:43] your many blessings and and Lord we just
[0:45] ask for blessing as we study these
[0:47] things out this morning Lord certainly
[0:49] we know what we're relying on you for
[0:50] Spiritual Perfection Lord and to bring
[0:52] us to a place
[0:54] Lord we can have confidence in your word
[0:56] and I pray God as you're just blessed by
[0:58] the way that he's prepared and studying
[0:59] Lord bless our ears to hear Lord we ask
[1:02] in your name
[1:05] so in verse 39 it says and these all
[1:07] having obtained a good report through
[1:09] faith received not the promise all the
[1:11] ones that um
[1:12] that that was very timely yesterday half
[1:15] that that sermon that brother Luke was
[1:17] preaching he's he's basically
[1:18] appreciating what we've been studying on
[1:20] it I was telling brother Wade yesterday
[1:22] pretty much everything he said was
[1:24] actually in my in my slides and so forth
[1:26] uh many of the main points that he
[1:29] covered so that's it's it's just amazing
[1:31] to see the spirit move and just line
[1:34] everything up just like that
[1:36] but we've been talking about the the
[1:39] cloud of witnesses in Hebrews 11 that
[1:41] that Paul mentions in Hebrews 12 a cloud
[1:44] of witnesses that we've got all these
[1:46] examples of our of of people that
[1:48] instead of looking at the circumstances
[1:50] they just looked straight at Christ but
[1:52] yet they never attained the promise that
[1:54] was promised to us the promise of a Holy
[1:56] Ghost Field of life and uh in Hebrews 12
[1:59] you know Paul would go on to say we
[2:01] we've come to those things we've come to
[2:03] the to what they were just looking at
[2:05] and in verse 40 it says God having
[2:07] provided some better thing for us that
[2:10] they without us should not be made
[2:12] perfect and so just kind of meditate on
[2:14] that what is perfection
[2:15] and to think this morning that they're
[2:18] they're waiting on us
[2:20] that they're relying on us that they
[2:21] need us
[2:22] to come to a place of perfection and you
[2:26] know it where you how are you going to
[2:27] get perfect it's not by like brother
[2:29] Luke was even preaching last night where
[2:31] you we can't put Works before faith we
[2:33] put Faith before it works because it's
[2:35] not our works that brings Perfection but
[2:36] it's our faith in him the finished work
[2:39] in Jesus Christ that brings Perfection
[2:41] it's Christ it's all about Christ
[2:43] it's not what I am brother Brown would
[2:45] say in the unconditional Covenant that
[2:47] God made with the people it's not what I
[2:48] am who I am it's the Perfection of Jesus
[2:50] Christ and God that died in my place to
[2:53] make me what I am it isn't whether I can
[2:56] stand I can it's whether he stood in my
[2:59] place
[3:00] and he said that would make a Baptist
[3:02] out there's something about it that's
[3:03] real why is it something that's real
[3:05] because it's Christ that's doing the
[3:07] work it's Christ that uh as we were uh
[3:11] the last time I spoke uh just on a topic
[3:13] as we were studying things out that
[3:15] message that Intervale is Christ that
[3:17] takes you from a place of struggle to a
[3:19] place of rest because when you're
[3:21] resting in Christ it's him doing the
[3:22] work not you
[3:25] will say the law of having a shadow God
[3:27] requires perfection
[3:29] no one could ever come to Heaven outside
[3:31] of being perfect you must be perfect and
[3:34] yet the scripture says None is perfect
[3:36] so if you must be perfect to come to
[3:38] heaven then and the scripture says None
[3:40] is perfect and we've all sinned and come
[3:42] short of the glory of God how are we
[3:44] ever going to enter God's living place
[3:46] and Dwelling Place when he requires
[3:48] perfection
[3:50] Jesus said I believe in the sermon on
[3:52] the mountain he said be therefore
[3:54] perfect even as your father in Heaven is
[3:56] perfect
[3:57] think of the Perfection that God
[3:59] requires of the Perfection of the person
[4:01] of perfection
[4:03] and that's what Hebrews 11 verse 40 says
[4:05] that they without us should not be made
[4:07] perfect Hebrews 10 said for the law
[4:08] having a shadow of good things to come
[4:10] and not the very image of the things can
[4:12] never with those sacrifices which they
[4:14] offered year by year continually make
[4:16] the comers and they're into perfect so
[4:18] those Believers in that great cloud of
[4:20] witness Witnesses in Hebrews 11 they
[4:22] could never come to this Perfection the
[4:24] law could never bring you to a perfect
[4:25] what Perfection perfection in Christ
[4:27] where he's not looking at you anymore
[4:29] he's looking at himself he's looking at
[4:31] what he's done and you he's looking at
[4:33] his life he's looking at his blood he's
[4:35] looking at the the Perfection
[4:37] when God looks at himself how can you
[4:40] find like like Paul said how can you
[4:43] hold anything to the charge of God's
[4:44] elect if God has filled your heart with
[4:47] the Holy Ghost and God is residing there
[4:48] how can you how can you hold anything to
[4:51] the charge of somebody that's been made
[4:52] perfect
[4:54] for then would they not have ceased to
[4:55] be offered because that the worshipers
[4:57] once purged should have no more
[4:58] conscience of sins that's what the Holy
[5:00] Ghost does it changes you changes the
[5:03] way that you think it changes the way
[5:04] you are to make you like Christ and the
[5:08] message identification it said his
[5:10] sinless nature expressed God's word and
[5:12] the only way that you will ever be able
[5:13] to express God's word that you believe
[5:15] it and watch it act behind you you will
[5:18] have to have that sinless nature that
[5:20] come from God before the foundation of
[5:23] the world you must recognized with him
[5:25] before the word can ever express itself
[5:27] through you it takes a sinless nature to
[5:30] do that what kind of what kind of nature
[5:32] the nature of Christ that God can give
[5:35] you his nature so that you're you become
[5:37] from somebody that wants to fight and
[5:40] stew and and rail to a meat little lamb
[5:44] nature
[5:45] and what in the message identification
[5:47] he said that don't mean perfection in
[5:49] yourself
[5:50] you can't be that but you see even our
[5:52] people are getting away from the
[5:54] practice of Holiness we begin to let
[5:56] down so many bars see we come to we got
[5:58] to come to that place of our profession
[6:00] he is our example and he is our sin
[6:03] Bearer and then if we profess that he is
[6:05] our Peacemaker he is our propitiation
[6:08] then if we profess that then that is
[6:11] supposed to reflect him back in US
[6:14] oh you see why the the word that you
[6:17] hear is actually accomplishing something
[6:18] in your life as you you're you're born
[6:20] by the word and that produces the Life
[6:22] of Christ in your soul but as you
[6:24] continue to eat the word it's like
[6:25] looking in a mirror until you become
[6:27] more and more and more like Christ and
[6:29] what is it doing it's not you it's not
[6:32] your Perfection it's Christ's Perfection
[6:34] the way you look in the mirror and and
[6:36] it's it's Christ's Perfection being
[6:38] reflected back because now where you
[6:41] used to act like the world you're
[6:42] behaving and thinking and walking like
[6:45] Christ it's Christ that's on this place
[6:47] so where is your Perfection come from
[6:49] Christ not from your own works not from
[6:52] the from the lies of the devil or the
[6:54] things of this world but from Christ
[6:56] the word is actually bringing you to a
[6:59] place of perfection
[7:01] and just some little thoughts that I
[7:02] just put some nuggets that I pulled out
[7:03] of different things that brother Ram
[7:04] said he said it's a perfect place
[7:07] calling you to that Perfection and you
[7:10] have to be perfect to get there
[7:12] and he said Perfection come by Jesus
[7:14] Christ
[7:15] and another place he said he has
[7:17] perfected forever those that are
[7:19] Sanctified or cleaned by the Holy Spirit
[7:21] then we are in Perfection now you can
[7:24] see from that previous slide that
[7:25] Perfection is tied to Holiness because
[7:27] somebody that's oh Jesus ain't going to
[7:30] have nothing to do with an Unholy life
[7:32] you've got to be Sanctified before just
[7:34] a little baby form Sanctified
[7:36] sanctification before God can even
[7:37] Tabernacle himself and your soul because
[7:40] God will not dwell in an unclean vessel
[7:42] so Perfection is tied to Holiness and
[7:45] that's what this statue of perfect man
[7:46] is about a holy godliness and brotherly
[7:49] kindness and these things are a holy
[7:52] life
[7:53] and you see even that that last slide if
[7:55] we go back to that real quick he said
[7:56] people people start getting they
[7:58] dropping the bar away from Holiness God
[8:00] has called us to a holy life a separated
[8:03] life a life that looks different from
[8:06] the world
[8:09] he is perfected forever those that are
[8:11] Sanctified are cleaned by the Holy
[8:12] Spirit then we are in Perfection God's
[8:14] Great Holy Spirit he said in another
[8:15] place moving in the hearts of the people
[8:17] bringing that Eve and Adam together
[8:20] again in their perfection God's holiness
[8:23] and God's Perfection bringing us back
[8:26] together again where we're not thinking
[8:28] different we're not walking different
[8:29] we're not living a different way than
[8:32] Christ would live and as we get through
[8:34] some of the slides here what we're
[8:35] seeing but what brother Rama is trying
[8:37] to express to us
[8:38] through the scriptures that Perfection
[8:40] is a Oneness where God where where you
[8:44] can look at the bride and see Christ
[8:46] manifested again not something different
[8:48] but Christ actually veiled into your
[8:51] flesh again
[8:52] he said and then you be therefore
[8:54] perfect even as your heavenly father is
[8:56] perfect how can you be when it's not my
[8:58] perfection it's not your Perfection it's
[9:00] his Perfection of his word that he chose
[9:03] you you never chose him and he brought
[9:05] you into Christ and you are secure with
[9:07] Christ and just as perfect as Christ was
[9:09] before God but you're not standing with
[9:11] your own you're standing in him with one
[9:13] thing I believe God it's his Perfection
[9:17] of his word
[9:18] and Christ is the mystery of God
[9:20] revealed brother random would say
[9:21] Hebrews 11 said they could not be
[9:23] perfect without us hands and feet cannot
[9:25] be perfect without the brains the
[9:27] knowledge the head and so forth see and
[9:30] we're all perfected in him
[9:32] like brother Luke was preaching last
[9:34] night by one Spirit we're all baptized
[9:37] into one body free from judgment it's
[9:40] his spirit it's his life it's the life
[9:43] that was in the blood that makes us
[9:44] perfect
[9:45] and I'll just read through some of these
[9:47] quotes pretty quickly Matthew 5 48 says
[9:49] be perfect therefore as your heavenly
[9:52] father is perfect
[9:53] in Philippians 3 12 it says not that I
[9:56] have already obtained this or have
[9:58] already arrived at my goal but I press
[10:00] on to take hold of that for which Christ
[10:02] Jesus Took hold of me and there's Paul
[10:05] talking again about that race we've got
[10:06] to go there's a finish line that we're
[10:08] racing to and what's what's the Finish
[10:10] Line Perfection Oneness with Christ
[10:13] where we've oh oh you you think about
[10:15] her brother man would Express that sin
[10:18] the things that people do are attributes
[10:20] of sin and the the re and the reason why
[10:23] you do things misbehave is because you
[10:25] you disbelieve God's word but think
[10:27] about the effect that could happen if
[10:29] you just believed all of God's word it
[10:31] will change your life it will change the
[10:32] way that you are that's what's happening
[10:34] as you as you Feast on the word it's
[10:36] making you like Christ
[10:39] in first Thessalonians 5 23 may your
[10:41] whole Spirit now this is we talk a lot
[10:43] about the scripture that that Martin
[10:45] Luther preached on the just shall live
[10:46] by faith this is the the scripture that
[10:48] John Wesley preached on May your whole
[10:50] Spirit soul and body be kept blameless
[10:53] at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[10:55] because what was John Wesley preaching
[10:57] on us we'll get to in just a moment he's
[10:58] preaching the statue of a perfect man
[11:00] that God can sanctify your spirit and
[11:03] make you holy make you make you live a
[11:05] life that's that's been purged by the
[11:08] word that is being cleaned up so that
[11:10] your thinking is different
[11:12] in Hebrews chapter 6 verse 1 said
[11:14] therefore let us move beyond the
[11:16] elementary teachings about Christ and be
[11:18] taken forward to maturity in first John
[11:21] 4 18 says there is no fear in love but
[11:23] perfect love drives out fear perfect
[11:26] love
[11:27] and Colossians 1 28 says he is the one
[11:30] we Proclaim admonishing and teaching
[11:32] everyone with all wisdom so that we may
[11:34] present everyone fully mature in Christ
[11:39] in Ephesians 4 13 that we all know till
[11:42] we all come in the unity of the faith
[11:44] and of the knowledge of the Son of God
[11:46] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[11:48] the stature of fullness of Christ and
[11:51] that word perfect means full-grown adult
[11:53] a full measure
[11:55] a full-age mature
[11:57] so brother Rama one place he said it's a
[12:00] living seed
[12:01] it's a word of God it'll grow to its
[12:04] perfection
[12:05] so when you hear when that word has been
[12:07] planted in your heart it will grow and
[12:09] grow and grow until finally you see the
[12:11] bark come on it you see the leaves come
[12:12] out you'll see the fruit it's bearing
[12:14] something and that's what we're doing
[12:16] now I want to take a just quick look at
[12:18] some what some of these denominations
[12:19] believed about produce what about uh
[12:22] about perfection because I think it'll
[12:25] it'll be helpful
[12:27] the reformed calvinist View believes
[12:30] that you you just can't come to
[12:31] Perfection that there's you just you're
[12:33] you're born again and and you can't come
[12:36] to it so I'm just going to summarize
[12:37] these notes now Martin Luther finished
[12:40] he just centered on Christ finished work
[12:43] on the cross and they don't view
[12:45] sanctification as a second work of Grace
[12:47] so he was just focused on you're just
[12:50] you're Justified you're you're I know
[12:53] what was Martin Luther preaching on the
[12:55] Born Again experience that we're not
[12:57] born again you're not justified by faith
[12:59] in what the Roman Catholic Church
[13:01] teaches or by by uh confessing your sins
[13:04] to a priest or things like that but he
[13:07] was preaching a new birth the right way
[13:09] to be born again rather than seeking to
[13:11] Achieve Personal Perfection lutherans
[13:13] rely on Christ's perfect righteousness
[13:15] and putative Believers through faith now
[13:16] John Wesley took it up a second stage he
[13:19] taught the doctrine of Christian
[13:21] perfection
[13:22] also known as entire sanctification and
[13:26] this view emphasizes a second work of
[13:28] Grace in other words after you're born
[13:29] again there's more to it there's more to
[13:32] it that that that God can clean up your
[13:34] life and and and change things I'm I'm
[13:37] not talking about clean up like dirty
[13:38] living I'm talking about cleaning up the
[13:40] way you think so that you can love your
[13:42] brother so that this these things so
[13:45] that you can live a clean holy life what
[13:47] what's Perfection again we're talking
[13:49] about we're talking about a whole holy
[13:50] living
[13:51] holy living toward one another well you
[13:53] can forgive one another and really love
[13:55] one another this view emphasizes the
[13:58] second work of Grace after conversion
[13:59] where Believers can attain a state of
[14:01] perfect love and purity
[14:03] enabling them to live a life free from
[14:06] willful sin now let's see what brother
[14:08] Brown taught about this he said who is
[14:09] this and who is this Melchizedek he said
[14:12] now we see here plainly the complete
[14:14] secret of our lives in Journey and death
[14:16] and where we go after we die also
[14:18] predestination is in Plainview here now
[14:21] listen as we teach this closely the
[14:23] stages of the Eternal purpose he had and
[14:26] his secret has now been revealed there
[14:29] is still three stages to perfection
[14:33] just like he redeems the world same way
[14:35] he redeems his church and and the reason
[14:37] let's not lose focus of what we're
[14:39] talking about we're talking about that
[14:40] they the Hebrews 11 folks are waiting on
[14:43] us and so it's prudent for us to
[14:46] understand these things because we've
[14:48] got to come to Perfection they are
[14:49] waiting on us to come to perfection
[14:51] there are still three stages to
[14:53] Perfection just like he redeems the
[14:55] world same way he redeems his church he
[14:58] redeems the people in three stages first
[15:01] is justification like Luther priest now
[15:05] it's helpful to us for us to understand
[15:07] what Luther was preaching when he
[15:09] preached justification he wasn't just
[15:11] preaching about a baby form of
[15:12] justification Luther was born again he
[15:15] was born again he was preaching the
[15:17] right way to be born again
[15:18] second sanctification like Wesley
[15:21] preached third baptism of the Holy Ghost
[15:24] then comes the rapture
[15:28] and the Third Exodus brother Brown would
[15:29] say God always goes in threes he's
[15:32] perfect in threes you all notice my
[15:34] preaching it's always Threes And Sevens
[15:36] threes is his perfection
[15:39] first
[15:41] second
[15:42] and third pull
[15:45] I know all everything see justification
[15:48] sanctification
[15:50] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[15:53] now we've got three stages here now
[15:55] brother Brown when he preached um
[15:58] uh
[16:00] future home the future home message I've
[16:02] got kind of an outline of the three
[16:04] stages as we're just studying these
[16:06] things out so that we can try to be
[16:08] plain in the and the and the first quote
[16:11] I've got here he said now the first step
[16:13] of justification is repentance toward
[16:16] God and it goes on to explain you got
[16:18] your sins have been chopped off what you
[16:19] did that your past has been chopped off
[16:22] but you keep going up you keep going
[16:24] higher you're now the second stage you
[16:27] are completely Justified as though you
[16:29] never did it at the beginning
[16:31] as though you never did it at the
[16:33] beginning this is a quote from the
[16:34] invisible Union
[16:36] and the third you're standing completely
[16:38] you never sinned at the first place God
[16:42] don't even know it's in the sea of
[16:45] forgetfulness you never did it now so
[16:48] this first this first quote here is from
[16:50] the message
[16:51] um
[16:52] future home of the Heavenly bride and
[16:53] the second and third quotes are from the
[16:55] invisible Union
[16:56] brother Rand was saying the gods
[16:57] provided place of worship he said this
[16:59] church will come through justification
[17:01] through Luther through sanctification
[17:03] through Wesley through the baptism of
[17:05] the Holy Ghost to the Pentecostals and
[17:07] go right on into the Perfection of the
[17:10] son of man that when husband and wife
[17:12] will be not different but the same
[17:16] person God will be so manifested into
[17:19] his bride his church to they will both
[17:22] be the same
[17:23] they are one now you see where we're at
[17:26] that's why we keep going back to this
[17:28] chart that brother brother Wayne's been
[17:30] preaching on that I'll just touched on
[17:32] just for a moment and you can see those
[17:33] three stages of perfection and what
[17:36] what's bringing Perfection as you eat
[17:37] the word it's United like just looking
[17:39] in the mirror the mirror of God's word
[17:41] as Paul will say you're feasting on the
[17:43] word it's but you're coming more and
[17:45] more like Christ and the first stage
[17:47] will be your new birth that you're born
[17:48] again and the second stage will be God
[17:51] is sanctifying you as you move up the
[17:52] statue of perfect that's what the statue
[17:54] of perfect man is he's cleaning you up
[17:56] cleansing you until finally you come to
[17:59] adoption where you get to a place where
[18:01] God really the place where God really
[18:02] wanted you and that is what is necessary
[18:05] to bring the Saints from the ground
[18:09] he said three is perfection the ministry
[18:12] come to us Perfection when it reproduced
[18:14] Christ again in natural amongst human
[18:17] beings as was predicted as it was in the
[18:19] days of Allah and another quote he said
[18:22] in the seat is not air with the shook he
[18:24] said now we understand also that God is
[18:25] perfected in threes God is perfected in
[18:29] three grace is five seven is completion
[18:31] like The World God is perfected and
[18:33] father son Holy Ghost that's the
[18:35] Perfection of the godhead now there's
[18:37] also in in paragraph 49 there's also
[18:40] three in Perfection of the steps of
[18:42] Grace to the church
[18:43] justification sanctification baptism of
[18:46] the Holy Ghost that consists of the new
[18:49] birth just like a natural birth is typed
[18:51] by it which a woman gets three three
[18:53] steps three steps to come into
[18:55] Perfection with Christ and that's why
[18:57] Paul was saying God having provided some
[18:59] better thing for us that they without us
[19:01] should not be made perfect and in
[19:04] Hebrews chapter 6 Paul said therefore
[19:06] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[19:08] of Christ let us go on unto Perfection
[19:10] not laying again the foundation of
[19:13] repentance not laying in this Foundation
[19:15] here at the bottom but let's keep going
[19:17] on to perfection in Christ
[19:19] and first Thessalonians that said for
[19:21] this we say unto you by the word of the
[19:23] Lord that that we which alive and remain
[19:26] in the coming of the Lord shall not
[19:27] prevent them once you're asleep for the
[19:29] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[19:30] with a shout the voice of the Archangel
[19:32] on with the Trump of God and the dead in
[19:33] Christ shall rise first and that ties
[19:36] back perfectly with what Paul is saying
[19:38] that we've got to be made perfect so the
[19:41] dead in Christ will come forth from the
[19:43] ground this is a promise that the Lord
[19:45] himself will come with a message to
[19:46] unite us with him so to bring the Dead
[19:49] from the ground
[19:50] that because they without us shall not
[19:52] be made shall not be made perfect
[19:54] brother I'm sitting in the Statue of a
[19:55] perfect man he said you get it these
[19:58] people who died in here are depending
[20:00] and waiting on us
[20:02] so this church has got to come to
[20:04] perfection in order to bring the
[20:06] resurrection
[20:08] and they're under Souls under the altar
[20:10] waiting for this church to come to his
[20:11] Perfection that when Christ does come
[20:14] and this church you see is coming
[20:16] smaller smaller in the minority
[20:20] and he said let's get the message to the
[20:22] dying
[20:23] that's what he's waiting on us to do now
[20:26] you think does this really drive at home
[20:28] to make it personal you think about all
[20:29] your loved ones many of us are many of
[20:31] the ones sitting here have lost spouses
[20:33] or loved ones and and to think that they
[20:36] are actually waiting on you I think
[20:38] that's really maybe a lot of fire under
[20:39] us that if they're waiting on us then
[20:41] it's prudent on us to do these things
[20:43] that he's incurred like Paul Paul was so
[20:46] encouraging if you really read Hebrews
[20:47] 11 and 12 and Hebrews 12 he's telling
[20:49] you don't give up let's run this race
[20:52] with with everything that's in us
[20:54] because and and even brother Brown would
[20:56] say what are we what are we doing at
[20:57] church for we're here for a purpose to
[21:01] unite to unite with Christ to see his
[21:04] word made manifest in us and he was
[21:06] brother I want to see it and and the
[21:07] sudden secret going away of the church
[21:09] he said oh what we need today is a
[21:11] calling together a getting ready and not
[21:13] depending on the preacher but you as an
[21:15] individual before God make yourself
[21:18] ready for the coming of the Lord
[21:20] no matter what they call you and what
[21:22] action they take that doesn't change God
[21:24] one bit God will do it just the same
[21:26] he's depending and waiting on us oh if
[21:29] we can be like those Saints in Hebrews
[21:31] 11 and not look at circumstances not
[21:33] look at other people that are maybe
[21:34] preaching wrong or doing wrong or living
[21:36] wrong but just keep our eyes right on
[21:38] Christ because there's he is the goal
[21:41] Christ is the goal to bring us to
[21:43] Perfection to want to be one with him
[21:45] and the message I knoweth that not he
[21:47] said what are we coming here for what
[21:49] are we doing are we coming here playing
[21:51] a game are we coming here meeting as a
[21:53] largest Christ can't come until that
[21:56] church is perfectly right he's waiting
[21:59] on us
[22:00] what's he waiting on he's waiting on a
[22:02] church without a spot or a wrinkle he's
[22:06] coming back like that story that brother
[22:07] random told of a little girl that got
[22:09] married to the to the to the meat
[22:12] company man that when he comes she was
[22:14] already waiting for him with her wedding
[22:16] clothes on and that's how Christ is
[22:18] going to come he's going to come back
[22:19] for a bride that has been Sanctified and
[22:22] cleansed and made perfect that has gone
[22:25] through those three stages of perfection
[22:27] not not because somebody made her a
[22:30] coaster into it because individually
[22:32] individually you got yourself ready
[22:35] individually if you go back and study
[22:37] out that message and Oneness
[22:38] brother Ram said God wanted to deal with
[22:40] us each individually and would draw us
[22:43] back into Oneness with himself
[22:44] individually we all have our own
[22:46] individual walk that we're doing it's up
[22:48] to you and I individually and he said
[22:51] and not one word or one iota that will
[22:53] ever fail the church will be in that
[22:55] shape when Jesus comes now to think
[22:58] about that sometimes you look around and
[23:00] I I know ministers get discouraged
[23:03] sometimes you look around and see the
[23:05] shape that that seems like things are in
[23:07] like brother Luke was preaching people
[23:09] leaving it doesn't seem like they have a
[23:11] real stake in there they don't have a
[23:13] stake in the ground if they're leaving I
[23:15] I I I was telling brother Wade I just
[23:18] last Sunday I preached at a church that
[23:20] their Pastor just a year ago left the
[23:22] message and we come back and I stayed
[23:24] overnight in Kentucky with Monica's
[23:26] family and they were telling me another
[23:27] Pastor there that's 80 years old just
[23:29] left the message and what is it they
[23:31] they just they don't they don't have
[23:33] they're not rooted and grounded they're
[23:34] not they don't have a real experience in
[23:37] the world because if Christ comes into
[23:39] your heart
[23:42] oh no isn't that what brother Ram taught
[23:45] us in the interval justification you're
[23:47] living by your faith and that faith can
[23:49] Faith Can can go away you'll lose it
[23:51] Saints vacation you you might believe
[23:54] for a little bit but then you'll stop
[23:55] believing but now when he gives you his
[23:58] faith that's permanent and if he's
[24:00] really given you his faith you're not
[24:03] going to stop her and turn around
[24:05] his faith is permanent my brother Adam
[24:09] said in the Statue of a perfect man he
[24:10] said you get it these people who died in
[24:12] here are depending and waiting on us so
[24:15] this church has got to come to
[24:16] perfection in order to bring the
[24:18] resurrection and they're under Souls
[24:20] under the altar waiting altar waiting
[24:22] for this church to come to his
[24:23] Perfection that when Christ does come oh
[24:27] I think that should be encouraging to us
[24:28] this morning as we're getting ready to
[24:30] close now if you just if you're if
[24:32] you're if you've just been born again
[24:33] you're wondering what comes next oh
[24:35] there's more there's plenty more oh you
[24:37] can you can even discern when you hear
[24:39] people preaching things oh God has
[24:42] called us not to just preach like a
[24:43] little baby form like just repentance
[24:45] and things there's so much more when
[24:47] you're born again oh it just opens up
[24:49] the whole world of things and that's
[24:51] that's why that's why one of the
[24:53] greatest evidences that you've been born
[24:54] again is do you see do you see what the
[24:57] message is really about maybe if you're
[25:00] questioning if you're born again this
[25:01] morning one of the greatest evidences
[25:03] that you're born again is that the
[25:04] spirit of truth will lead and guide you
[25:07] into all truth
[25:08] or look back in your life and see do you
[25:11] really see do you really see these
[25:13] things that seem complex and and
[25:15] difficult to understand are all you are
[25:17] you looking at like these people that
[25:19] are leaving the message all do you all
[25:21] you see is just whether or not brother
[25:23] Brandon said there were ten thousand
[25:25] people when he uh when the light came to
[25:27] him on on when he as he was baptizing on
[25:29] the Ohio River and just all the little
[25:31] the little little things that just a
[25:34] human is going to do is that all you see
[25:36] or do you see Christ because the
[25:39] revelation of Jesus Christ is the
[25:41] evidence of the new birth to you and
[25:44] we'll stop on that God bless you
[25:46] [Applause]
