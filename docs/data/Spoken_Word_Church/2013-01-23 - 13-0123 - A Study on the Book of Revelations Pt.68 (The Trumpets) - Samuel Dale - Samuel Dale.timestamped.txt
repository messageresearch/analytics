[27:18] of revelation 8 just remember each one
[27:20] that they're sick there's plenty of them
[27:22] that's
[27:23] this out and i hope they're watching
[27:25] tonight and everything
[27:26] and we're just praying that the lord
[27:28] would reach down and
[27:29] touch each and every one because he said
[27:31] he sent me a word and healed
[27:33] and delivered from destruction so that
[27:36] that we can depend on and
[27:38] and say thank you lord and thank you for
[27:40] the the way of internets and things to
[27:42] where we can
[27:43] be in the service and you know and kind
[27:46] of look in
[27:47] on the things and and not have to miss
[27:49] church
[27:50] because it's a hard thing but just
[27:52] remember each one all of these that are
[27:54] coughing all the
[27:55] sicknesses and all the things that have
[27:57] taken place
[27:59] satan's just doing everything he can to
[28:01] hinder in every way that he can
[28:03] but we know who the victory is you know
[28:05] who the healer is
[28:07] so we just thank you revelations 1 and
[28:10] revelations 8 now remember
[28:12] i know you've announced this but wade
[28:14] will be preaching at brother pinkston
[28:16] uh this coming weekend and i think on
[28:18] wednesday also
[28:20] and then the bible study will be on
[28:22] february
[28:23] the 2nd that'll be the first saturday in
[28:26] february so we'll announce that ahead
[28:29] and also too we've got to have the
[28:31] voting for the officers
[28:33] coming up this sunday so if it's anybody
[28:35] that doesn't want to serve in your
[28:37] office
[28:38] or anything you know any that's the part
[28:40] that you have
[28:42] let us know by then because that way we
[28:44] don't have to
[28:45] vote and everything we can just do it on
[28:48] over all one vote
[28:49] and everything will be taken care of but
[28:52] if not then we have to replace people
[28:55] because we got to have the people to do
[28:57] the jobs and and the working and
[28:59] everything else
[29:00] and you know to take care of it okay
[29:03] revelation 1 revelation 8.
[29:06] heavenly father we thank you lord for
[29:08] your grace and your love
[29:10] thank you for the day and the hour that
[29:11] we're living that we could lord
[29:14] take a little time during the week and
[29:15] just set it aside and
[29:18] get together and that we could talk a
[29:20] little bit about you
[29:22] we know that the hour is approaching of
[29:24] all things when
[29:26] these things will be removed from us or
[29:28] the opportunity of maybe even
[29:30] having a service and things because we
[29:32] know satan's doing everything he can to
[29:35] stop in every way you know and getting
[29:38] all the controls that he can get
[29:40] and it'll be there but yet the little
[29:42] bride will be protected
[29:44] because all even though egypt was in
[29:47] darkness
[29:47] goshen had light so we thank you for the
[29:50] promises that you've given them to us
[29:52] and all the things
[29:53] and we pray now that you bless each one
[29:55] remember all the ones that are sick
[29:58] lord just reach down and touch each one
[30:02] you just deliver from these old cold
[30:04] flus whatever they're called
[30:06] we know it's just satan in every way he
[30:08] can trying to hinder us
[30:11] we know who the healer is and we love
[30:12] you and we thank you
[30:14] we ask you to guide us all in what to
[30:16] say on these things and just have your
[30:18] way now in jesus name
[30:21] amen revelations
[30:27] one that we've been reading then we'll
[30:29] go to revelation 8
[30:32] it says the revelation of jesus christ
[30:34] which god gave unto him
[30:36] to show unto his servants things which
[30:38] must shortly come to pass
[30:40] and he sent and signified it by his
[30:42] angel and to his servant john
[30:44] who by record of the word of god and the
[30:46] testimony of jesus christ and of all
[30:48] things that he saw
[30:50] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[30:52] hear the words of this prophecy
[30:54] and keep those things which are written
[30:55] therein for the time
[30:58] is at hand now we're going to revelation
[31:02] 8 we're going down to verse two now
[31:04] we've been on verse one
[31:06] you know and talking on the seventh seal
[31:09] you know and uh now we're picking up
[31:11] into the trumpets
[31:13] so we want to try to cover a little bit
[31:15] on that tonight and try to get some of
[31:17] these things
[31:18] out of the way to where we can move
[31:19] through on through the book of
[31:21] revelations
[31:22] verse 2 in revelation 8 verse 2.
[31:26] and i saw the seven angels which stood
[31:28] before god and to them
[31:30] were given seven trumpets and another
[31:33] angel came and stood at the altar having
[31:35] a golden censer
[31:36] and i was given unto him much incense
[31:39] that he should offer it with the prayers
[31:41] of all the saints upon the golden altar
[31:43] which
[31:44] was before the throne and the smoke of
[31:47] the incense which came with the prayers
[31:49] of the saints ascended up before god
[31:52] out of the angel's hand and the angel
[31:54] took the sensor and filled it with fire
[31:56] from the altar
[31:57] and cast it into the earth and there
[32:00] were voices and thunderings and
[32:01] lightnings
[32:02] and an earthquake and the seven angels
[32:05] which had the seven trumpets
[32:08] prepared themselves to sound you may be
[32:11] seated
[32:11] lord it is blessing to the reading of
[32:14] the word
[32:16] now we're not going to spend a lot of
[32:19] time
[32:20] in this we're going to just try to jump
[32:24] through in
[32:25] through some of the things and if
[32:28] there's any questions then
[32:30] you uh write it out and we'll try to
[32:32] back up a little bit and cover it
[32:34] and you know try to to do some things
[32:37] like that
[32:38] and answer questions but you know
[32:41] what i i want you to do is to think with
[32:44] me
[32:45] that we've been through the going
[32:47] through the book of revelations
[32:49] we've come up through and we've covered
[32:51] now over
[32:52] up to cover revelations as far as the
[32:55] 10th chapter
[32:57] and covering the thunders being the
[32:59] voice of god when the seals would break
[33:01] and all then speaking to to us by way of
[33:04] the prophet messenger
[33:06] and in bringing to us the plan of
[33:09] redemption
[33:10] now this that we're doing we're looking
[33:13] at
[33:14] something that is a hard thing to
[33:16] sometimes comprehend by
[33:19] our natural minds but when john is taken
[33:23] up in chapter
[33:24] 4 i don't believe that he went to heaven
[33:27] physically you know i don't believe that
[33:31] he went up there in a corporal body
[33:34] you know i'm just honest i don't believe
[33:37] that
[33:38] if i'm wrong i'm wrong but i'll stand
[33:41] for correction
[33:42] but i i want to to be able to try to
[33:45] hold it together
[33:47] you know in the doings and john would
[33:49] see things
[33:51] that transpires in heaven
[33:54] he may look back toward the earth
[33:57] and do it but yet still he's seeing it
[34:00] in heaven
[34:04] he he's in heaven he's in a heavenly
[34:06] place
[34:08] he's taken up beyond the days of man
[34:12] and gone into the day of the lord all
[34:15] right
[34:15] and to me and to give an example of it
[34:18] would be like brother branham was when
[34:20] he went beyond the curtain of time
[34:23] and he saw people and he saw many
[34:25] different things
[34:27] and was able to come back and tell it
[34:29] but he wasn't there physically
[34:32] you know in a body if we talk about it
[34:36] he was there in his soul which is his
[34:39] theophany
[34:41] and he saw those people in theophany
[34:43] which would be their soul
[34:45] but yet when he saw him he saw people he
[34:48] didn't see spooks floating around he
[34:50] didn't see
[34:51] you know just all kind of little things
[34:54] he saw
[34:57] those people and was able to handle them
[34:59] and
[35:00] and hear them talking and and all kind
[35:03] of things
[35:04] well see then brother branham would when
[35:07] he would
[35:07] tell us about those things he would tell
[35:09] it like that
[35:11] basically like that he was physically
[35:13] there
[35:14] but he wasn't there in a physical form
[35:17] john was taken up to the day of the lord
[35:20] which is beyond the days of man
[35:24] going on into the eternities and
[35:27] to me then you don't have to have
[35:29] something to be there well john went up
[35:31] physically i don't believe he did i've
[35:33] always told you
[35:35] if to me if you saw john he would be
[35:37] laying on patmos maybe with his
[35:39] head you know hands behind his head and
[35:42] you remember he was two years
[35:45] in receiving this revelation
[35:48] so it wouldn't have been a bodily
[35:50] transfer off the earth
[35:52] as much as it is it is it's just a
[35:55] vision
[35:57] revelation brother will call us
[36:01] i've listened to him so many times
[36:02] because i keep it in my truck
[36:04] on the uh he'll say you know people talk
[36:08] about the sermon he said it's a
[36:10] revelation
[36:12] it's a revelation to him just like god
[36:16] revealing one god to us
[36:19] it's like him revealing something you
[36:20] know his name or whatever
[36:22] the prophet when he would see it he
[36:24] would see it by revelation
[36:27] and he would see people going somewhere
[36:30] or traveling or something happening you
[36:32] know
[36:33] and he said it's a vision but he said
[36:36] it's a revelation we'll see then we try
[36:41] to figure all of those things out and we
[36:42] get all this
[36:43] confusion out of it and trying to
[36:46] comprehend but just remember the book of
[36:50] revelations then
[36:51] until you actually come over now i'm
[36:54] going to say it this way so listen
[36:57] until you come over to chapter 22 and
[36:59] the future home comes down
[37:02] up until that time you're dealing with
[37:05] a spiritual revelation being revealed to
[37:08] john
[37:08] in heaven
[37:13] you see yeah we'll be right back into
[37:14] now that's telling what's going to
[37:17] happen
[37:19] that's what i want you to to think with
[37:21] me tonight just one point about the
[37:24] the trumpets is to not try to figure out
[37:29] what
[37:30] happened to cause him to write this
[37:33] you know we'll read some of these about
[37:36] the trumpets and things
[37:38] but you know you look right try to find
[37:40] some great big stone
[37:42] falling out of the sky
[37:45] it's like i've told you it's a great
[37:47] thing to me that in one of these uh
[37:50] i think it's in one of the trumpets that
[37:52] it's talking about a great catastrophe
[37:55] happened
[37:56] and it said seven thousand men died
[38:02] well i mean just a year ago there was
[38:04] 200 000 people
[38:08] died with one earthquake just commies
[38:11] whatever what you call them big old
[38:12] words
[38:13] water running
[38:16] but yet my point is see the bible would
[38:19] emphasize that well if somewhere
[38:21] that would take place like that
[38:24] but look like this over here would be a
[38:26] more major catastrophe
[38:32] but god doesn't choose to write like
[38:34] that
[38:36] if he wrote it down and said you know uh
[38:41] the 25th day of january so and so is
[38:44] going to take place
[38:46] well that wouldn't be no mystery
[38:49] everybody know it but he can write in
[38:52] the bible and tell you what's going to
[38:54] take place
[38:54] and you know what it might take place on
[38:56] that day
[38:59] but that's my point of of doing we went
[39:01] through the plan of redemption
[39:04] we went through the seals and the church
[39:06] ages and come over in the plan of
[39:08] redemption
[39:11] and to seeing that seeing all of the
[39:14] things that transpire
[39:16] you know and coming up to that the great
[39:18] mystery of the
[39:19] seventh seal you know and seeing that
[39:22] it's his coming
[39:23] right but yet we're still here
[39:31] but see there's a mystery goes with that
[39:34] that would show us that we can say he's
[39:37] here
[39:39] in the world look at his worm
[39:43] right right right around i'm not saying
[39:46] he's coming i'm saying he's here
[39:50] come on where's he at behind
[39:56] but you see it was a revelation to him
[40:00] it was like john seeing it on patmos
[40:03] right around sees it by revelation
[40:07] he's taken up into the revelation but
[40:10] not leaving the earth
[40:11] he was standing in the tabernacle
[40:13] preaching them from the pulpit
[40:16] and yet the greatest things that was
[40:18] taking place was
[40:19] being made manifest he said i've never
[40:23] worked in a realm like that before
[40:25] remember
[40:26] he says the opening of the word
[40:30] well to the revealing of god's word
[40:34] instead of us looking to try to figure
[40:36] out what this is and what that
[40:38] is you know
[40:41] when is it going to be that it's going
[40:42] to be this stonefall
[40:44] anything you're searching well ain't
[40:47] never seen no stone fall that big
[40:51] well does it mean it hasn't happened
[40:56] because before we start into these
[40:58] trumpets to talk about them
[41:01] brother adam says six of the trumpets
[41:04] has already sounded all right
[41:06] all right amen
[41:12] and he even says the sixth one just
[41:14] sounded
[41:15] like
[41:19] where was it at i don't know i ain't
[41:22] profit
[41:24] are you even if you got it figured out
[41:26] you wouldn't have nothing
[41:30] but my point is is for us to get into
[41:33] seeing the things that is
[41:36] to be cold to you and i
[41:41] i wrote it down like this because
[41:44] actually you take chapter 7 8 9
[41:48] 11 12 notice there'll be a couple of
[41:50] gaps now
[41:51] 7 8 9 11 12 14
[41:54] 15 16 is really dealing with the calling
[41:58] out of israel
[42:02] of 144 000 people
[42:06] but it's like i've tried to tell you
[42:08] it's like to me like the book of daniel
[42:11] read that sometimes and just read it and
[42:13] just start reading the first and then
[42:15] read the next and read the next
[42:17] but don't try to say well
[42:20] no just read it across and see that it's
[42:24] taking place
[42:27] then a lot of it took place right there
[42:30] maybe some of it would be future
[42:34] but still to look at it and see that
[42:37] we're not looking for some kind of
[42:38] something to fall out of the sky
[42:42] we'll get over a minute where the
[42:43] prophet was talking about these locusts
[42:45] coming out with
[42:47] stingers in their tails and they're the
[42:49] long hired he said
[42:50] it was the men let their hair grow out
[42:52] longer torment to women
[42:58] see we're looking for some great
[43:00] something
[43:01] you know some animal some live looking
[43:05] something some
[43:06] hideous looking things well i i'm not
[43:09] too much on your tvs and things with it
[43:11] but
[43:12] uh you see some of these rock groups
[43:16] and the way they look they look like
[43:19] animals as a matter of fact i ain't
[43:20] never seen an animal that looked that
[43:22] bad
[43:24] that's that was just me not i mean
[43:26] that's more hideous than anything that
[43:28] you could ever see in an animal race
[43:32] but i want you to look at it and and see
[43:34] that
[43:35] that these things are taking place
[43:39] have taken place are taking place and
[43:42] maybe some of it is still to
[43:44] take place but yet not to try to figure
[43:48] out
[43:50] what this is but to just see what is
[43:52] related to you and
[43:54] i about it because now if six of the
[43:57] trumpets
[43:58] has already sounded why would you be
[44:00] trying to figure out well
[44:02] well i just wonder whether it was a
[44:03] great big stone failed or
[44:05] what no i looked through what the
[44:09] prophet had to say and spent quite a
[44:10] time
[44:11] of just trying to pick up the things of
[44:13] the scriptures that
[44:15] he done and and there's very little and
[44:18] he'll answer
[44:21] about these things but then he'll say
[44:25] that it's taking place you say this is
[44:29] the it works out
[44:31] what we're seeing we shouldn't be
[44:33] looking to try to figure out some kind
[44:35] of a
[44:36] an animal something to fit into the
[44:38] situation
[44:42] but to realize these things have already
[44:46] taken place
[44:51] now that's the whole point of the
[44:52] message tonight
[44:55] that's why i say i may not i made this
[44:57] totally jump to
[44:58] to over a good bit
[45:02] starting sunday with something you know
[45:03] maybe i don't know
[45:06] because the main things i said i want
[45:08] you to see
[45:10] is basically everything after
[45:14] which would really be after revelations
[45:16] 4 1
[45:17] is to israel until you come over
[45:20] until revelations 19.
[45:25] amen well see that that's not even to us
[45:30] that's why when the prophet come along
[45:32] he preached a message
[45:33] he was planning on preaching the
[45:35] trumpets and a different thing
[45:36] but he said i seen i had already
[45:38] preached them supernaturally
[45:40] under the seals he said right
[45:44] well
[45:47] so then we go over there and we study
[45:49] that
[45:51] of the calling out of the 144 000 and i
[45:53] said just about basically every
[45:55] scripture
[45:56] the ones i call a while ago i picked out
[45:58] 10 and left it out because
[46:00] that does do but that still has to deal
[46:02] with the calling out of israel
[46:05] they're called out by this message right
[46:10] all right it's just picking it out to
[46:12] where that we can see the things
[46:14] in the situation like i said daniel then
[46:16] daniel is showing you
[46:18] the same vision higher higher
[46:22] higher higher
[46:28] just like i told you sunday then in
[46:30] chapter
[46:31] six there were the the dealing with the
[46:33] opening of the sixth seal
[46:35] it doesn't talk about 144 000 in no
[46:38] scripture
[46:41] he tells you about the earthquakes and
[46:43] the things that's going to take place
[46:46] but see by way of the prophet he told us
[46:51] chapter 7 is the calling out of israel
[46:56] then you get into the trumpets that
[46:58] we're dealing with
[46:59] here tonight in chapter nine
[47:03] you know eight and nine with a with the
[47:05] trumpets
[47:07] and that's the calling out of israel
[47:12] he said well if that's the calling out
[47:13] of israel then what do we need to know
[47:15] about it
[47:16] we need to know what happened to israel
[47:21] all right and annoying what happens to
[47:24] israel
[47:25] will show us what's happening to you and
[47:28] i
[47:28] am like he says on the feast of the
[47:30] trumpets he said these trumpets is to
[47:32] israel
[47:33] he said really there's only one point
[47:37] we'll get back to that maybe the likes
[47:39] of the message but he said there's
[47:40] really only one point here
[47:42] talking about the bride
[47:46] but yet it's like i've tried to get you
[47:48] to read the seal book and the things
[47:50] of reading the seals
[47:54] and looking in there that that's to
[47:56] israel
[47:59] yet there's a whole lot said for the
[48:02] plan of redemption for you and i
[48:09] israel that's israel that's israel let's
[48:12] go to the next one
[48:13] that's israel that's israel that's
[48:14] israel
[48:18] now there was a lot about those seals
[48:21] and this is the point i want you to get
[48:23] a lot about those seals that brother
[48:25] said they started in genesis
[48:31] started in genesis but yet didn't
[48:35] really hasn't opened yet in reality
[48:40] because
[48:43] there's israel
[48:48] they're after we get out of here
[48:52] but yet we look been at it because of
[48:56] revelation
[48:59] do we go up chapter four
[49:03] well you just think about it until we
[49:06] write back
[49:09] in the 19th chapter
[49:12] that's all that's all that's dealing
[49:13] with you
[49:16] the rest of it is to israel and the
[49:18] things that are taking place
[49:20] but yet it's showing it see looking back
[49:22] to see where these things start
[49:28] they started back in genesis like in the
[49:32] the feast of the trumpets you'll read
[49:33] the message
[49:35] he said these things that you can read
[49:37] here he said
[49:39] that happened back there when they was
[49:41] coming out of egypt
[49:44] all right but that was when listen
[49:49] that was when israel was being called
[49:51] out in the natural
[49:57] it is not in the end time when they're
[49:59] called out in the spiritual
[50:01] right
[50:04] you know i'm looking at the quotes from
[50:06] the prophet that's what he's he's trying
[50:08] to get us to see but i'm just trying to
[50:10] to get us to understand because there's
[50:12] no visitors tonight we can just
[50:13] just kind of cover something and and
[50:16] preach about it a little bit and
[50:18] you know and get a better understanding
[50:23] you see we we read these things and we
[50:25] try to figure it out
[50:26] but why try to figure it out
[50:34] we can get lost trying to figure out
[50:36] what hap when it happened
[50:38] and failing to get to revelation
[50:44] and see the main thing is to see that
[50:45] it's already happened
[50:47] that's right when did the moon turn to
[50:50] blood
[50:51] i don't know we need to know where to
[50:54] move
[50:55] no we don't need to know when the moon
[50:56] turned to blood because you might find
[50:59] out
[51:02] because see we can go through these
[51:03] things you can do your eyes and whatever
[51:08] you might find out the fulfilling of the
[51:10] moon turning the blood or the sun
[51:12] a third of it taken away or some you
[51:15] might find out it was when
[51:16] mount saint helen blowed its top out
[51:20] there
[51:22] you might find out back in history that
[51:25] you've actually had times when almost
[51:27] the entire
[51:28] world was covered with darkness because
[51:31] of the clouds
[51:32] that are from the eruptions in these
[51:34] volcanoes
[51:38] see but my the main thing i want you to
[51:40] just deal with me about it is
[51:43] is these things have already transpired
[51:51] and you and i are the bride
[51:54] we're not like the world wondering what
[51:57] these are
[51:58] right but you see now they get what i'm
[52:00] talking about
[52:02] i hope this don't offend nobody out
[52:04] there but
[52:06] see the religious world wants to know
[52:09] about
[52:10] the beast the the hairy animals the
[52:14] the things that look like a great crank
[52:15] king kong beast
[52:17] or some kind of a things that we'll read
[52:19] here with hell and
[52:21] fire falling and that's all they're
[52:24] interested in
[52:28] no they just that brother so-and-so now
[52:30] if you read the books he's got out
[52:32] manny he tells us all about when these
[52:34] things took place
[52:37] okay
[52:41] but i thought that we were supposed to
[52:44] get
[52:46] the revelation of redemption from
[52:49] reading the bible
[52:52] not the revelation of who russia is
[52:54] coming down after china's coming down
[52:56] after
[52:56] so-and-so is coming down and this is
[52:58] coming down
[53:00] you know
[53:03] because we're supposed to be out of here
[53:05] when they come down
[53:07] so what good does it do we're going up
[53:10] the sky and rapture wouldn't be
[53:11] something whatever
[53:12] i told you but that's going to be when
[53:15] russia was coming out now they're coming
[53:17] down right over there
[53:20] but around him one day he said when you
[53:21] see jerusalem passed about on every side
[53:26] according to scripture
[53:30] and i looked at it and realized our set
[53:32] all of those people
[53:34] russia on one side china on the other
[53:35] side and the united states on the other
[53:38] side
[53:39] sitting right there already come passed
[53:42] about
[53:43] all you got to do is just one little
[53:46] bomb or something go
[53:47] off in the wrong direction and it'll be
[53:50] heyday
[53:53] but i want to find out something that'll
[53:55] get me out of here
[53:59] i want to find out something about
[54:00] redemption
[54:03] and like i said well ago if we can see
[54:05] the redemption of israel
[54:07] then we can see the redemption of the
[54:10] bride
[54:11] and see what's taking place all right
[54:15] see these things then will be after the
[54:18] rapture
[54:19] like run around we'll get on over maybe
[54:21] another message or something revelation
[54:22] 12.
[54:23] he said this takes place between the
[54:25] rapture
[54:28] and armageddon or something like that
[54:32] we'll see then you can go back and see
[54:33] that some of those things is back over
[54:36] here
[54:41] but just remember what was happening
[54:44] as we go through these trumpets the
[54:46] prophet will say
[54:47] that it was the calling out of israel in
[54:51] the natural
[54:52] that you'll see the hail and the stones
[54:53] and the the rivers turn to blood and
[54:56] the different things we read up here but
[54:58] he said this is in the spiritual
[55:00] happening
[55:01] in other words over here in the end time
[55:03] right right all right
[55:06] now and in doing that we can see
[55:09] that whatever transpires to bring them
[55:12] to that redemption
[55:15] is what's bringing us to redemption
[55:18] which is the revelation of jesus christ
[55:21] all right now in doing that see keep
[55:24] that point in mind
[55:25] to where that when we look at it that we
[55:28] won't be trying to figure out
[55:33] we'll just be doing as a prophet would
[55:35] do
[55:40] he said these things to the trumpets he
[55:43] said they have nothing to do with the
[55:44] bride
[55:46] this is the calling out of israel
[55:51] he said now that the trumpets
[55:55] now get to get the background and when
[55:56] we get over to the great trumpet
[55:59] you know and see our day where we're at
[56:01] all right then it'll pick up with you
[56:04] but you see those trumpets back there
[56:05] you know what happened
[56:07] they called israel to the atonement
[56:13] you know they were down in egypt
[56:21] i'm letting you think because maybe
[56:22] it'll click a little then
[56:25] when the hail and the fire and the
[56:27] lightning and the different things that
[56:29] you read up
[56:30] under these trumpets they were down in
[56:33] egypt they had not even
[56:37] offered an atonement yet
[56:41] sure they were offering sacrifices but
[56:43] you know what i mean moses had never
[56:45] come along
[56:46] to give them it's a book of exodus i
[56:48] think is where you start picking up your
[56:51] in leviticus where you start picking up
[56:53] your offerings and your different things
[56:58] we get us a calling out your prophet
[57:01] said these trumpets
[57:03] is a calling of a feast day
[57:08] calling of a war he said
[57:13] bringing forth a certain person
[57:20] is what these trumpets are all right
[57:25] now then if that means that
[57:29] god was calling israel out to bring her
[57:33] to
[57:37] why was he bringing israel out of egypt
[57:39] because he promised yes right
[57:41] but what was the point
[57:44] he was calling them
[57:48] they were hearing the voice of god to
[57:50] lead them through moses
[57:52] to bring them out until word they could
[57:54] make the atonement
[57:56] in leviticus 16.
[58:01] that would be the natural atonement when
[58:03] they came out got everything set up
[58:07] all of that travel from egypt coming
[58:09] down to the time
[58:10] moses set that up
[58:14] was the feast of the trumpets
[58:18] calling them out to a time
[58:22] that they get the atonement
[58:25] all right now that was calling out of a
[58:29] natural people to a natural land natural
[58:31] things
[58:33] and a natural atonement
[58:37] all right we're seeing the end time
[58:40] under these feasts of the trumpets
[58:45] that's why the prophet to me titled it
[58:47] that away feast of the trumpets
[58:52] there's many things involved in it we've
[58:53] been through it here the dead pentecost
[58:55] the different things is
[58:56] involved in it under the feast days
[59:01] we see israel in the last days now
[59:03] listen
[59:04] israel in the last days is not going to
[59:06] go back to offering
[59:08] now we're not talking about natural
[59:09] israel we're talking 144 000 right
[59:12] everybody following me they're not going
[59:14] to go back to offering natural
[59:16] sacrifices
[59:18] so leviticus 23
[59:21] read the feasts of the tropics leviticus
[59:23] 23 is a mourning for the kill
[59:27] it is not a re-killing
[59:30] leviticus 16 is the killing of the
[59:33] animal the atonement
[59:35] and all that feast was leading all them
[59:38] trumpets with leading them down
[59:39] to bring them down to word that they
[59:41] could finally settle
[59:44] and to hear a great gospel trumpet
[59:49] that would bring them to their natural
[59:50] atonement of the animal
[59:53] but they're not going back to the
[59:55] natural atonement of animals
[59:57] by the prophet the feast of the trumpet
[59:58] he said this is a spiritual sense
[1:00:02] in the last days he said there caught me
[1:00:05] and called here to
[1:00:06] a day of mourning for the keel
[1:00:10] right see back there they offered the
[1:00:14] animal
[1:00:16] you with me they offered the animals
[1:00:19] they didn't have a morning for a kill
[1:00:21] they had a rejoicing
[1:00:26] that the atonement was made
[1:00:29] okay see it's not showing the end time
[1:00:33] it's not a natural atonement
[1:00:35] they're not going back to offering 144
[1:00:38] thousands not
[1:00:39] going back to offering blood bulls and
[1:00:41] ghosts and natural israel will be trying
[1:00:43] to do that yeah
[1:00:47] but that's not who you're dealing about
[1:00:49] in here or the calling out
[1:00:50] as i gave you and called out the
[1:00:52] scripture 7 8
[1:00:54] 9 10 or no clean over to 19
[1:00:58] and really it goes on over
[1:01:02] but listen my point is this
[1:01:06] israel in the last days
[1:01:12] you've heard the story told to the
[1:01:13] prophet you've read the scriptures
[1:01:16] that when this 144 000 comes to see
[1:01:19] their messiah they're going to pull
[1:01:22] apart right
[1:01:24] and they're going to mourn as for one
[1:01:27] the scripture says of losing their only
[1:01:29] child
[1:01:32] that back you under when they was coming
[1:01:34] out of egypt and come to the natural
[1:01:36] atonement
[1:01:38] was a killing of the atonement
[1:01:44] moses tried
[1:01:48] to smite the rock twice and it wouldn't
[1:01:50] work
[1:01:52] so it wouldn't be a killing in the end
[1:01:54] time
[1:01:57] it's a morning for the keel in other
[1:02:00] words they are going to be brought by
[1:02:02] revelation
[1:02:04] those two witnesses will bring christ so
[1:02:07] personal to that hundred and forty four
[1:02:08] thousand till they'll sit in there and
[1:02:10] say
[1:02:11] where did you get your nail press in
[1:02:12] your hand
[1:02:16] it's not gonna be standing there with
[1:02:18] holes in hand it'll be moses and elijah
[1:02:25] bringing the messiah signed down to
[1:02:28] israel
[1:02:30] you see how dangerous would have been if
[1:02:32] brother rattleman went to eat
[1:02:33] to israel with that messiah signed
[1:02:39] because that's what israel is looking
[1:02:41] for
[1:02:43] the sign of the prophet the discernments
[1:02:45] and the things
[1:02:48] to tell them these things but you see
[1:02:51] they're not
[1:02:52] they're not going to be called back to a
[1:02:54] re-killing the prophet said
[1:02:57] it's a mourning for the kill in other
[1:03:00] words they realize what happened
[1:03:06] they realized what happened back there
[1:03:11] at calvary they realized that that was
[1:03:16] the true atonement that they spoke of
[1:03:19] right and they killed him
[1:03:25] that atonement that for leviticus 16
[1:03:28] was speaking of calvary and christ and
[1:03:30] the lamb you know
[1:03:35] all right but then when it comes down
[1:03:38] into the end
[1:03:40] it's a morning for the kill
[1:03:44] turning them to the original atonement
[1:03:50] which was not leviticus 16. that was a
[1:03:53] natural atonement
[1:03:56] they're not being called to a natural
[1:03:58] atonement of animals and blood
[1:03:59] goats and things bring feasts to the
[1:04:01] trumpets or listen to it
[1:04:04] they're being called to the atonement of
[1:04:06] jesus christ
[1:04:07] that 2000 years ago in calvary there was
[1:04:10] your lamb that paid the price
[1:04:14] that was why your trumpets was calling
[1:04:16] them to that
[1:04:19] but you just thanked them standing there
[1:04:22] while their god was trumpeting out of
[1:04:24] heaven
[1:04:29] their god was hanging on a tree
[1:04:33] and saying father forgive them
[1:04:36] they don't know what they're doing
[1:04:39] they're crying letting blood be on us
[1:04:41] and our children and that's what's
[1:04:43] caused the trouble
[1:04:47] but you see they're coming back in the
[1:04:48] end time to realize that that they
[1:04:50] crucified jesus christ
[1:04:52] and it'll be a morning for the keel not
[1:04:54] the morning for the leviticus 16
[1:04:57] an animal that he was killed back under
[1:04:59] come on
[1:05:00] get up into the message with me
[1:05:05] see then you're looking at it and seeing
[1:05:07] hey
[1:05:08] they're being brought back to the
[1:05:10] original atonement
[1:05:13] in the morning for the kill
[1:05:16] all right listen to the prophet tonight
[1:05:22] do you realize that the holy ghost we'll
[1:05:24] quote it in a minute and give it to you
[1:05:26] the holy ghost has been bound for 2 000
[1:05:29] years
[1:05:33] i didn't say that your prophet did
[1:05:37] all right now the holy ghost has been
[1:05:39] bound for 2 000 years what about the
[1:05:40] early church
[1:05:47] he said well he didn't really mean that
[1:05:49] i'm sorry he said it twice
[1:05:52] in the book and according to the book he
[1:05:53] says these things are thus saith the
[1:05:55] lord
[1:05:56] about two times in the message there
[1:05:59] but see that's what i'm saying there was
[1:06:00] a man set years ago there was so many
[1:06:02] slips of the tongue that brought around
[1:06:03] and made in the feast of the trumpets
[1:06:05] that you couldn't understand what he was
[1:06:07] talking about
[1:06:08] well i agree because he was trying to
[1:06:11] figure it out intellectually
[1:06:13] and you can't do it
[1:06:18] but if you just settle down and think
[1:06:22] you realize church if israel is to be
[1:06:24] brought back to the original atonement
[1:06:27] what about the bride of jesus christ
[1:06:32] do you know that the holy ghost the
[1:06:33] prophet will read it to me it said
[1:06:35] the holy ghost was to be loosed by the
[1:06:37] end time message
[1:06:41] so the holy ghost has been bound all the
[1:06:43] way down through there
[1:06:44] because it never could work the way he
[1:06:46] wanted to
[1:06:48] the great book of acts with the holy
[1:06:50] ghost in it was not the way god wanted
[1:06:52] to bring
[1:06:56] the great things down to the ages of god
[1:06:58] dealing with his people
[1:07:00] and speaking to him was not what he
[1:07:02] wanted
[1:07:07] see this message is to bring you and i
[1:07:10] back
[1:07:10] to the original atonement
[1:07:14] not a re-killing we're not wanting
[1:07:18] christ to get up on the cross and die
[1:07:19] again
[1:07:21] no but bring us to the original
[1:07:23] revelation
[1:07:26] it's like i've always tried my best to
[1:07:27] tell you you've got to come to the faith
[1:07:30] of the fathers for
[1:07:31] before you can talk about the revealing
[1:07:33] of the seals
[1:07:36] i've done that for 40 years folks and i
[1:07:38] still ain't backing up well i don't know
[1:07:42] how to say the father don't know what
[1:07:44] seals are
[1:07:44] so does oral roberts university they got
[1:07:47] the books and the tapes
[1:07:50] i'll try to explain that to you week
[1:07:52] after week after week now
[1:07:54] right that's why to me that paul said
[1:07:56] you can have understand all mysteries
[1:07:59] and how not cherokee right
[1:08:05] he's talking of two things this charity
[1:08:07] right down here is faith
[1:08:08] the born again experience then he goes
[1:08:11] up to the top
[1:08:12] amen of charity
[1:08:16] that's him me all right
[1:08:21] we see as israel is what i'm saying
[1:08:23] taking the feast of the trumpet but
[1:08:25] bringing it back to you and i
[1:08:29] they are turned to the original
[1:08:31] atonement
[1:08:33] of calvary by this message that leads us
[1:08:37] and goes to them
[1:08:42] you see you and i have got to return to
[1:08:44] the original atonement
[1:08:51] see how could you count the people of
[1:08:52] this message the way they're talking
[1:08:54] about jesus doing wrong and
[1:08:55] wouldn't god to the river jordans and
[1:08:58] this was wrong the prophet was this
[1:09:00] how can you count them as to saying
[1:09:04] that they're in the word but yet they
[1:09:07] know the quotes by the letter
[1:09:09] right
[1:09:13] right they can quote brother random to
[1:09:16] the letter
[1:09:19] the words of revelation
[1:09:25] see without it being revealed it's
[1:09:26] nothing anyway but letters on the page
[1:09:31] around said as long as it's laying in
[1:09:32] this bible what'd he say
[1:09:34] it can be questioned but he said when
[1:09:37] it's revealed
[1:09:39] it comes off of these pages into your
[1:09:41] heart it can never be questioned again
[1:09:44] see that's the original atonement
[1:09:51] you realize how long i've been trying to
[1:09:53] preach something to you and i
[1:09:57] 40 something years talking about
[1:10:01] matching pieces
[1:10:06] do you realize in revelations 5
[1:10:12] he has to climb up on that throne and
[1:10:15] shut down
[1:10:17] to fulfill revelations 5.
[1:10:21] and you know that was when he was
[1:10:23] crucified and went to the father's
[1:10:24] throne
[1:10:26] but is it there in our revelation
[1:10:32] how could he be messing up doing wrong
[1:10:34] jesus you know and all that how could he
[1:10:36] be not god
[1:10:41] and then you're going to try to put him
[1:10:43] on the throne in revelations 5.
[1:10:45] well i don't think that's important i
[1:10:47] don't believe that's important
[1:10:49] well then how did he get on the throne
[1:10:50] of your heart come on
[1:10:52] amen
[1:10:56] come on how did he get in your heart
[1:11:01] by the new birth he climbs up on this
[1:11:03] throne in our heart
[1:11:10] it speaks from there
[1:11:17] see revelations five has got to be
[1:11:18] fulfilled
[1:11:22] he climbs up on the throne sits down
[1:11:28] i thought your prophet said that when
[1:11:32] jesus raised from the dead
[1:11:34] and brought up those old testament signs
[1:11:42] i would listen to some quotes if you
[1:11:44] were if i were you
[1:11:46] where he says that he took them up
[1:11:50] and he took a right to the father's
[1:11:52] throne
[1:11:55] and the father says climb up on the
[1:11:57] throne and sit down
[1:11:59] and i'll make your enemies your
[1:12:01] footstool
[1:12:05] i would check out some things
[1:12:09] but you see
[1:12:12] it's got to be a revelation you've got
[1:12:16] all kind of quotes for everything but
[1:12:17] what about revelation
[1:12:18] yeah that's right listen church
[1:12:24] if the holy ghost has been bound for 2
[1:12:26] 000 years
[1:12:28] that's according we'll give it a minute
[1:12:29] to quote
[1:12:31] then it means the holy ghost has never
[1:12:33] worked the way he wanted to
[1:12:43] you know come down the holy ghost being
[1:12:44] by him but that wasn't what the prophet
[1:12:48] said
[1:12:50] he said it was bound for two thousand
[1:12:52] years you know there in the book of acts
[1:12:54] they already had the antichrist work
[1:12:57] right
[1:13:00] you already had a phillips and armenians
[1:13:02] and all kind of doctrines
[1:13:07] and you better remember that it was an
[1:13:09] early church that went to nicea
[1:13:12] come on you better remember that
[1:13:15] he said well they laugh and come back
[1:13:16] all right i'll agree with you they did
[1:13:19] but you know what your prophets you need
[1:13:21] to keep reading to where he said they
[1:13:23] had already picked up the thong
[1:13:29] what the hell did they pick up and i see
[1:13:32] that jesus
[1:13:32] wasn't god he was a secondary god
[1:13:39] now what about the doctrines in the end
[1:13:40] times that are teaching that
[1:13:42] that he's a demon god which means he's
[1:13:44] another kind of a god or a lesser god
[1:13:49] you see what i'm talking about church
[1:13:53] do you understand what i'm saying we've
[1:13:55] got to be returned to the original faith
[1:13:57] amen that 144 000 don't come over here
[1:14:01] to offer
[1:14:02] chips and goats right
[1:14:06] come on natural israel go back to doing
[1:14:08] that but not that 144 thousand right
[1:14:13] they come to the original atonement
[1:14:15] until they see him and say
[1:14:17] where did you get the nail prints
[1:14:21] he said i got him in the house with my
[1:14:23] friend
[1:14:26] he said well who are they they're
[1:14:27] looking at two prophets
[1:14:30] but do you have any trouble believing
[1:14:32] that when those two prophets speaks to
[1:14:34] israel that it's jesus christ in them
[1:14:37] speaking
[1:14:38] do you have any trouble with that
[1:14:41] if you do i'll remind you that there was
[1:14:43] a time on a tape
[1:14:45] when a voice come forth and said you're
[1:14:47] not hearing william branham
[1:14:50] you're hearing me i'm just using his
[1:14:52] voice
[1:14:53] come on you tell me
[1:14:56] david and them solomon them singing they
[1:14:59] pierced my hands and my feet
[1:15:02] actually getting into agony just like
[1:15:04] that they were hanging on a cross
[1:15:08] and we call that christ
[1:15:13] the brethren is not my god those two
[1:15:16] witnesses won't be their god
[1:15:18] but those two witnesses will bring god
[1:15:21] on the scene
[1:15:23] brought blood on the scene here in the
[1:15:25] end time amen
[1:15:29] but you're not hearing the voice of a
[1:15:30] man come on
[1:15:32] amen you see church we've got to be
[1:15:36] returned to the original atonement
[1:15:44] see in doing that we come back
[1:15:48] to not just the faith of the fathers
[1:15:51] we've got to continue on
[1:15:54] you see why all these 40 years i
[1:15:56] preached about the seal that the seals
[1:15:57] were not them
[1:15:58] to the bride the seals or the israel in
[1:16:01] the literal happening but the spiritual
[1:16:02] revelation is to the bride of christ
[1:16:05] amen
[1:16:06] the spiritual revelation should bring
[1:16:08] god just as real to you and i
[1:16:10] as the physical god could go to israel
[1:16:14] and i said that the way i wanted it i
[1:16:16] know he doesn't go there physically
[1:16:18] but you better think about what i said
[1:16:22] we should be god should be so real to us
[1:16:24] until he can become visible among us
[1:16:27] the prophet said and raise the dead and
[1:16:29] we'll go into rapture
[1:16:30] what through us come on hallelujah
[1:16:42] now see i need to back up about an hour
[1:16:44] and we're
[1:16:45] we started off that we read about these
[1:16:48] trumpets i just can't see where they'll
[1:16:51] ever happen
[1:16:54] the prophet said six of them already had
[1:17:02] but you see we we but brother dale
[1:17:07] i know you've been preaching for all
[1:17:08] these years about the bride
[1:17:13] brother branham said the bride will be
[1:17:15] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:17:20] the big man in this message passed on to
[1:17:22] glory that's his choice
[1:17:23] i mean his doing but he said you say
[1:17:26] that the
[1:17:27] the bride of christ is the fullness of
[1:17:28] the godhead bodily
[1:17:33] he said i i don't believe that
[1:17:38] i didn't say it
[1:17:42] of course when you believe these two
[1:17:43] lords you can't see it either
[1:17:45] that's right when you believe that jesus
[1:17:49] wasn't god until the river jordan and
[1:17:51] they finally become god
[1:17:52] i've got to play paper back there in the
[1:17:54] office
[1:17:57] be glad for you to read a newspaper
[1:18:01] you know that in january the 6th they
[1:18:03] got up here on lake lanier
[1:18:05] and they blessed the waters
[1:18:10] the orthodox catholics
[1:18:14] bless the waters on lake lanier it's
[1:18:16] called epiphany or how you
[1:18:18] pronounce it that's something close to
[1:18:20] epip
[1:18:21] h.a.m you got it right
[1:18:25] you know what that is that's in
[1:18:28] commemoration when jesus
[1:18:30] was baptized in river jordan
[1:18:34] now you read about the newspaper
[1:18:37] you know what it's called the feast of
[1:18:40] theophany
[1:18:44] go home and look up feast of theophany
[1:18:46] in your computer
[1:18:48] want me to look up anthony every how you
[1:18:50] say e-p-i-p-h-a-n-y i'm pretty sure
[1:18:55] and see what that is they do it every
[1:18:57] year
[1:18:59] i thought i need to take this newspaper
[1:19:01] and i need to print up about
[1:19:03] 500 of them and mail them out
[1:19:08] where these brothers could look down and
[1:19:10] see the glory
[1:19:12] the earth's word of theophany
[1:19:18] but you see church i've tried my best to
[1:19:21] preach to you and i
[1:19:23] to try to get us to return to the
[1:19:24] original atonement
[1:19:26] so we can see jesus christ among us
[1:19:31] now i'm going to say another word about
[1:19:32] it and i'll get off and get on the rest
[1:19:33] of the message
[1:19:34] but if your eyes are so blinded that you
[1:19:36] can't see god has been with us
[1:19:39] then i'm sorry for you physically and
[1:19:43] spiritually he has raised the dead
[1:19:47] he has healed the sick he has manifested
[1:19:49] himself in the spoken word
[1:19:51] through the little group at lula but the
[1:19:54] gospel has been preached
[1:20:02] it still stands all right
[1:20:05] pure and unadulterated from man's ideas
[1:20:09] you said no wait just a minute well
[1:20:12] it's got to be done one day let's get on
[1:20:15] with it if we don't believe it's here
[1:20:19] when are we going to believe it yes when
[1:20:21] are we going to believe that god is
[1:20:22] among us
[1:20:25] well maybe one of these days if i could
[1:20:27] see this out there i kind of i believe
[1:20:28] that
[1:20:30] well never will see it
[1:20:34] but you see israel is not going back to
[1:20:37] an animal
[1:20:39] that's right they're going to look back
[1:20:42] and see calvary
[1:20:44] listen they're going to see that jesus
[1:20:47] christ died
[1:20:48] they'll know he had the nail prints
[1:20:50] right
[1:20:51] because they could read the book right
[1:20:54] is it in this book
[1:20:55] right that he wound up with now pressing
[1:20:57] his hands is it in there that's who
[1:21:00] wasn't
[1:21:00] uh thomas had to put his hands in the
[1:21:03] day of friends
[1:21:04] well they won't see jesus that real but
[1:21:06] they're not gonna see him two thousand
[1:21:08] years ago
[1:21:10] right they're going to see my revelation
[1:21:15] and they're going to see him standing
[1:21:17] right there
[1:21:18] speaking through those two prophets
[1:21:22] i never have preached really what i saw
[1:21:26] brother brother said when i saw this
[1:21:30] i got up and walked out of the room
[1:21:34] go check what he was talking about
[1:21:37] he was talking about what god was going
[1:21:40] to do
[1:21:40] through two prophets to israel and he
[1:21:43] said i had to get up and walk out of the
[1:21:45] room
[1:21:45] why because he knew what was happening
[1:21:48] right there
[1:21:49] he said it's not been a man he said it's
[1:21:52] been the angels of the lord
[1:21:56] this message will go to israel by two
[1:21:58] prophets
[1:22:01] but they'll have something personal they
[1:22:03] don't have to go over there as wade was
[1:22:05] saying the other day about
[1:22:06] they'll tell it i know they'll tell it
[1:22:08] because there's no need to worry about
[1:22:09] it but they won't be going over i said
[1:22:10] let me give you a quote
[1:22:11] brother brown said so-and-so
[1:22:16] they'll have it in their own revelation
[1:22:19] but then they'll tell them a prophet did
[1:22:21] come and that's where i got to
[1:22:22] revelation right
[1:22:25] was from that prophet's message
[1:22:29] sure they'll take this message but they
[1:22:30] don't take brother adam
[1:22:33] it becomes something personal
[1:22:38] see then the gospel trumpet will sound
[1:22:45] to where in the end time they'll see
[1:22:48] jesus
[1:22:50] why because it'll be the true atonement
[1:22:52] right
[1:22:55] are you and i turn back to the true
[1:22:57] atonement
[1:22:58] come on there can't be no trinitarian
[1:23:02] concept in the truth
[1:23:03] that's right
[1:23:09] he said when he was talking to that jew
[1:23:13] i believe benton harbor where ryan or
[1:23:16] what received his eyesight
[1:23:20] and he said in other words how did that
[1:23:23] man get his eyes out
[1:23:27] you got to put about four messages
[1:23:29] together and then you'll get the whole
[1:23:31] story right around and finally told him
[1:23:32] what he said through jesus christ god's
[1:23:36] son
[1:23:37] that paid the price that jew don't
[1:23:39] wonder what he said
[1:23:41] he said you can't cut god up into three
[1:23:43] or four pieces
[1:23:44] but i said they know where that trinity
[1:23:46] come from
[1:23:48] he said you can't cut god up in three or
[1:23:49] four pieces
[1:23:51] and give them to a jew
[1:23:55] lord said what will the messiah what
[1:23:56] will be the you know the messiah he's
[1:23:59] willing to be born he said yes
[1:24:02] said who will it be did it be god
[1:24:07] they don't have no second person or
[1:24:08] third person or
[1:24:10] river jordan doctrines in theirs
[1:24:15] or two lords or two souls or any kind of
[1:24:18] time
[1:24:22] all they got to do is see the sound of
[1:24:24] the messiah
[1:24:27] but you better believe one thing
[1:24:31] all israel will be able to see the sign
[1:24:34] of the messiah
[1:24:36] i mean everybody you know what i'm
[1:24:38] saying they'll be over there with them
[1:24:40] you know that everybody don't get
[1:24:41] converted
[1:24:42] because the sign of the messiah comes
[1:24:44] through two prophets am i right
[1:24:47] but 144 000 that god pricks in their
[1:24:50] heart
[1:24:51] that's it there was a man saved on the
[1:24:53] day of pentecost and never been a man
[1:24:55] saved yet or one child or whoever
[1:24:57] that god didn't prick their heart before
[1:25:00] they received the new birth
[1:25:04] it's not to receive the new burden then
[1:25:05] you become pricked in your heart and all
[1:25:07] you're pricked in your heart
[1:25:08] read your bible men and brother what
[1:25:10] must we do to be saved
[1:25:13] they're going to stand there them two
[1:25:15] prophets in front of a big old crowd
[1:25:17] maybe thousands of thousands of them
[1:25:19] standing in and they'll be preaching and
[1:25:20] they'll say
[1:25:22] jesus christ died
[1:25:25] 99 of my turn around walk off and spit
[1:25:27] out them
[1:25:29] but you know there'll be a few that'll
[1:25:30] just hang around and say
[1:25:32] tell us a little more because something
[1:25:34] just spoke in my heart
[1:25:37] and i want to know amen
[1:25:42] right but are you following me
[1:25:48] the calling out of israel in the natural
[1:25:51] as they come out of egypt
[1:25:55] there's where you see the hail the
[1:25:57] stones the different things that you
[1:25:58] read
[1:25:59] and really to where you can read it and
[1:26:01] see that those things did happen
[1:26:05] but when you come over here in the
[1:26:06] spiritual quit trying to figure out what
[1:26:09] happened
[1:26:11] try to find the goddess of
[1:26:17] that voice of the trumpet
[1:26:20] seven angels remember there are seven
[1:26:22] seals there's seven
[1:26:24] angels it's in church ages all of those
[1:26:27] things ties together
[1:26:31] and all those trumpets and then brother
[1:26:34] brown will wind it up we'll go back pull
[1:26:35] his quotes up just a second
[1:26:37] but he winds up saying that the seventh
[1:26:41] trumpet to
[1:26:42] israel is the same as the seventh seal
[1:26:44] is to the bride
[1:26:51] think on these things think about it
[1:26:54] let's just read a little bit
[1:26:56] i won't ask them dude but get your bible
[1:27:02] if they can catch up with us we'll read
[1:27:04] it from that but
[1:27:05] let's read some of these trumpets and
[1:27:07] just see
[1:27:10] but think about it now don't try to
[1:27:12] figure them out
[1:27:14] think that they're already happened
[1:27:17] verse seven okay go ahead and pull up to
[1:27:23] revelation 8 verse 7 if you get to that
[1:27:26] time
[1:27:26] we'll start reading and the first angel
[1:27:30] sounded
[1:27:31] this is the troubles and therefore hail
[1:27:33] and fire mingled with blood
[1:27:35] they were cast upon the earth and the
[1:27:37] third part of the trees were burnt up
[1:27:39] and all
[1:27:39] green grass would burn up okay
[1:27:44] all right to get it up now so we can
[1:27:45] read it
[1:27:47] look
[1:27:51] i'm trying to figure out where that was
[1:27:53] at let's try to figure out and
[1:27:56] just remember that as the angels
[1:28:00] brought the prophet to revelation
[1:28:04] will not it be the angels it would bring
[1:28:07] the two prophets to revelation
[1:28:11] that's why you got seven trumpets of
[1:28:13] seven see we'll see
[1:28:15] all right so look at the next one and
[1:28:18] the second angel sounded
[1:28:20] and it's where a great mountain burned
[1:28:21] with fire was cast into the sea
[1:28:23] and the third part of the sea became
[1:28:25] blood
[1:28:26] we can't figure out where that would
[1:28:27] take place can we
[1:28:30] in the third part of the creatures of
[1:28:32] the sea were destroyed on
[1:28:34] the third angel in other words the third
[1:28:35] trumpet sounded and there fell a great
[1:28:37] star from heaven
[1:28:38] burning it where a lamp and it fell upon
[1:28:40] the third part of the rivers
[1:28:41] and upon the fountains of waters now i
[1:28:43] hunted up these things to see if i could
[1:28:45] find anything
[1:28:47] that would tie it together and help us
[1:28:49] now when you get to this one
[1:28:52] which would be coming under your third
[1:28:55] angel
[1:28:55] sounded in effect and the name of the
[1:28:57] star is called wormwood
[1:29:00] wormwood means bitter waters
[1:29:03] all right he was the one that destroyed
[1:29:05] the world with water
[1:29:09] so we made the waters bitter in egypt
[1:29:14] right coming out of the natural see you
[1:29:17] can go back here and try together
[1:29:18] but that was wormwood see i i just
[1:29:20] picked up some things but
[1:29:22] the fourth one sounded what and the
[1:29:24] third part of the sun was spitting the
[1:29:26] third part of the moon and the third
[1:29:27] part of the stars
[1:29:28] towards the third part of them were
[1:29:30] darkened
[1:29:32] and the day shown not for a third part
[1:29:33] of it and the night likewise
[1:29:36] you get all tired trying to figure out
[1:29:38] what that was and i heard a
[1:29:40] angel flying through the midst of heaven
[1:29:42] saying with a loud voice whoa
[1:29:45] whoa whoa to the inhabitants of the
[1:29:47] earth by reason of the other voices
[1:29:49] of the trumpets of the three angels
[1:29:51] which are yet to sound
[1:29:53] now woes mean wars world war one
[1:29:57] world war ii and armageddon will be
[1:30:00] world war three
[1:30:03] just because we declared war on
[1:30:05] afghanistan that didn't make it a world
[1:30:07] war
[1:30:07] ii come on that wasn't no world war a
[1:30:12] world war is when all of the world
[1:30:14] gained
[1:30:14] sides and comes at each other and that
[1:30:17] would be army dead
[1:30:18] all right flying through the midst of
[1:30:20] the heavens saying
[1:30:21] whoa whoa and we'll get to it just a
[1:30:23] minute on one of them and it says
[1:30:24] one woe don't happen all right now
[1:30:26] listen to what i'm saying if one was
[1:30:28] done happen
[1:30:29] then one woe was world war one so the
[1:30:33] prophet's right when he said all the
[1:30:34] trumpets sound under the sixth seal
[1:30:36] and he said six of the trumpets had
[1:30:38] already sounded
[1:30:41] over here not back there
[1:30:45] we didn't know neither trying to figure
[1:30:46] out what it is just pick up what we can
[1:30:48] through it
[1:30:49] to see this happen already
[1:30:53] well i want to know what this is that's
[1:30:55] what it is even 22.
[1:31:00] did you understand that one eve wanted
[1:31:03] to know too
[1:31:05] it took all her time for four times for
[1:31:07] 6 000 years she's tried to figure out
[1:31:09] these things
[1:31:10] that's what i said organized religion
[1:31:11] wants to know what all these is about
[1:31:14] all i want to know is when it takes
[1:31:15] place and when i hear the prophet saying
[1:31:18] already taken place
[1:31:21] i don't have to go back and figure out
[1:31:22] what took place
[1:31:25] i just say we're in the end time yeah
[1:31:34] there came out smoked locust all right
[1:31:36] locust on the air pull this one up
[1:31:39] there rose what now the locusts were at
[1:31:41] heaven there
[1:31:42] bottomless pit smoke rose out and then
[1:31:45] he jumped over me one right
[1:31:47] all right now we're down here back right
[1:31:49] here is where we get
[1:31:51] came out and smoked locusts upon the
[1:31:53] earth and they then was given power
[1:31:55] scorpions of their you know of the earth
[1:31:59] how power was given
[1:32:01] and it was commanded them that they now
[1:32:03] watch they don't hurt the grass
[1:32:09] scorpions and everything they hurt the
[1:32:11] people see
[1:32:13] they hurt the people that don't have the
[1:32:15] seal of god in their forehead
[1:32:18] all right so this is taking place while
[1:32:21] the seal of god is in our forehead
[1:32:24] do you understand i'm trying to get you
[1:32:27] to see that six of the trumpets has
[1:32:29] already sounded
[1:32:30] and we ain't in the tribulation period
[1:32:32] yet
[1:32:39] and see to find out then that we're here
[1:32:41] when the seal of god is still in the
[1:32:43] forehead and you're not to hurt the ones
[1:32:44] that's got the seal of god
[1:32:50] you say well that's 140 one thousand
[1:32:51] yeah that's in the natural but i'm
[1:32:52] bringing it back over here where we're
[1:32:54] at
[1:32:55] that's what i'm trying to show you these
[1:32:56] are showing where we are now
[1:33:00] the trumpets is showing where you and i
[1:33:02] are at
[1:33:05] we're in the time of the plagues and the
[1:33:07] vials and the things that are being
[1:33:09] poured out
[1:33:11] then when we go out of here it'll really
[1:33:13] get bad
[1:33:15] but it's already taken place now
[1:33:19] but look and to them it was given that
[1:33:23] they should not kill them
[1:33:25] but that they should be tormented five
[1:33:26] months and their torment was under the
[1:33:28] torment of scorpion
[1:33:31] when he strike at the man come on
[1:33:36] they'll seek death and can't find it
[1:33:38] because our design can't die
[1:33:41] they come out to be like locusts we're
[1:33:43] likely to horses prepare them to battle
[1:33:46] on their heads and we're crowned like
[1:33:48] gold that's not physical things that
[1:33:50] something that's happening
[1:33:52] but i don't know where it's happening at
[1:33:54] but i know it's happening now
[1:33:56] that's my whole point
[1:34:01] these things are happening because
[1:34:03] they're under the trumpets and the
[1:34:04] trumpets is sounding that
[1:34:06] unsounding and still sounding look at
[1:34:09] this one
[1:34:10] and then hires a higher women and their
[1:34:12] teachers and teeth of lines
[1:34:16] brother said it was they tormented him
[1:34:20] because
[1:34:20] women cut their hair off
[1:34:26] and you know in israel that was amazing
[1:34:29] to me
[1:34:31] when we went over there
[1:34:35] i was literally expecting to find women
[1:34:38] dressed as women
[1:34:44] i was expecting to find the and
[1:34:47] it was back to 50s and 60s you know and
[1:34:51] women had dressed decent and had long
[1:34:54] hair and had rolled up bonds and put up
[1:34:57] i never saw a woman over there that had
[1:34:59] any hair the only sister ones over there
[1:35:01] that had hair long enough to wash
[1:35:03] jesus's feet was the sisters that was in
[1:35:05] the crowd we was in
[1:35:07] now that's as much what i saw now i
[1:35:09] didn't go everywhere
[1:35:11] but i'm just saying i didn't see them
[1:35:14] living like that
[1:35:17] i saw them looking like modern-day
[1:35:19] americans
[1:35:20] with their hair cropped off in their i
[1:35:23] didn't see necessarily as much paint on
[1:35:24] their face but
[1:35:27] pants on and all kinds of things
[1:35:30] i was expecting right really when i saw
[1:35:32] that i thought
[1:35:34] well i really missed this one because i
[1:35:36] was expecting it to be
[1:35:40] annoying
[1:35:42] these things are taking place
[1:35:45] or have already taken place right
[1:35:49] had breastplates of iron and sound of
[1:35:51] their wings within the sound of chariots
[1:35:54] many horses running into battle you
[1:35:56] can't figure that out
[1:36:01] they had stingers in their tail and
[1:36:03] their power was to hurt men for months
[1:36:06] now here's one that we know a little bit
[1:36:08] about and they had a king over them
[1:36:10] which is the angel of the bottomless pit
[1:36:12] whose name in the hebrew tongue is
[1:36:15] abaddon
[1:36:16] and in the greek tongue his name is
[1:36:18] paulie one i guess you said pronounce it
[1:36:20] look it says and one was priced okay
[1:36:23] one world fight world war one is gone
[1:36:27] world war one you start seeing these
[1:36:30] fellas here coming into being
[1:36:32] after world war one what was that
[1:36:35] hitler mussolini and him killing the
[1:36:38] jews
[1:36:39] and driving them back to the homeland
[1:36:43] don't sound much like no joyous trumpets
[1:36:46] does it
[1:36:48] but that's what has taken place
[1:36:52] said that they were loosed on those jews
[1:36:57] hitler and them killed six million of
[1:36:59] them
[1:37:03] just because they were jews
[1:37:11] this has happened in our day
[1:37:14] some of us are old enough to remember
[1:37:17] the end of world war
[1:37:18] ii maybe
[1:37:22] and especially in the years after and
[1:37:23] then what we've seen of the
[1:37:25] the things where they showed these
[1:37:28] prison camps where they put them in
[1:37:29] there and kept them
[1:37:31] and killed them fed them to i mean done
[1:37:33] everything destroy them everywhere they
[1:37:35] shot them brother around said till they
[1:37:36] run out of bullets
[1:37:40] just because they were god's people a
[1:37:43] jew
[1:37:45] but that was driving them back to the
[1:37:47] homeland
[1:37:49] that was their trumpet
[1:37:52] if you're reading with me you listen we
[1:37:54] talk about trumpet being the voice of
[1:37:56] god that's right
[1:37:57] but what happened under that voice that
[1:37:59] voice tells you what's going to take
[1:38:00] place
[1:38:04] they released those demons
[1:38:09] and hitler and them drove them so not
[1:38:11] now let's see if we can pick up a few
[1:38:12] right now brother joe
[1:38:14] and we'll try to read just a little bit
[1:38:17] should be on over
[1:38:20] it's way over
[1:38:25] we want to go
[1:38:33] go to number 13
[1:38:37] and we'll start reading a few which is
[1:38:38] feast of the trumpets
[1:38:40] while they're getting there our boy and
[1:38:41] then we can pick up cause it'll be
[1:38:42] almost continual reading
[1:38:44] program 161 the feast of the trumpet and
[1:38:47] notice what happened
[1:38:48] under that sixth trumpet they were
[1:38:51] turned loose on the jews
[1:38:54] the persecution of the jews supernatural
[1:38:57] devils
[1:38:59] nearly 2 000 years bound you know kept
[1:39:03] nearly 2 000 years but then loosed
[1:39:07] supernatural devils by stalin hitler
[1:39:11] upon the jews you say well that isn't
[1:39:13] roman
[1:39:15] so he must have picked it up right he
[1:39:18] said it's the same spirit
[1:39:21] he says they've done the same thing at
[1:39:23] the old pagan rome done to the
[1:39:25] christians
[1:39:28] this is to drive israel back to the
[1:39:30] homeland folks
[1:39:33] it's not talking about joyous
[1:39:35] festivities of a feast of the trumpets
[1:39:38] that you're having a big time
[1:39:42] they were killed by the millions to
[1:39:44] drive them to the homeland
[1:39:46] the only way god could get them there
[1:39:50] you talked about those three worlds
[1:39:51] world war one world war ii and world war
[1:39:53] three
[1:39:54] you remember when brother claude i
[1:39:55] thought it was a marvelous thing and it
[1:39:56] fit real good
[1:39:58] brother claude was here preaching about
[1:39:59] it that time world war one
[1:40:07] ended without him knowing who stopped
[1:40:09] the war
[1:40:12] and it ended with israel being freed
[1:40:19] right israel being free that's where
[1:40:22] they were fighting over is israel
[1:40:25] they didn't know it they don't know
[1:40:28] who's
[1:40:28] who ended the war they know don't know
[1:40:30] nothing about it
[1:40:32] the brotherhood said i can show you in
[1:40:35] and 19 it wasn't them getting them wings
[1:40:38] to do it he said but i can show you
[1:40:40] something happened
[1:40:45] and see world war one didn't come to
[1:40:46] pass to get israel free
[1:40:50] you know to take over to get that
[1:40:51] country to set up where they could
[1:40:53] started being toward the nation
[1:40:55] world war ii came about because of
[1:40:57] israel
[1:41:00] and that's when they went into the
[1:41:01] homeland
[1:41:03] and begin to go free hitler and
[1:41:06] mussolini and all them killing them all
[1:41:08] over the place
[1:41:08] all over the world and driving them to
[1:41:10] the homeland
[1:41:12] but you know that was god's grace and
[1:41:13] mercy
[1:41:17] come on church
[1:41:21] we look at god as a a god that does no
[1:41:24] harm no
[1:41:24] no there's no nothing he had them to
[1:41:27] kill them jews to get them back into
[1:41:30] israel
[1:41:32] sometimes he works on us pretty good
[1:41:35] to get us back to the truth in the
[1:41:38] homeland
[1:41:40] right the message of the hour
[1:41:43] you just think what that prophet went
[1:41:45] through to bring this message to you and
[1:41:47] i
[1:41:48] thought think of all of the horrible
[1:41:51] times
[1:41:52] and all the things that happened and you
[1:41:54] know what even happened his wife and
[1:41:56] baby had to be taken from him
[1:42:01] we look at trumpets and things like
[1:42:03] beautiful things
[1:42:06] oh you're a trumpet let's go
[1:42:12] these are the trumpets that's taking
[1:42:14] place in our day
[1:42:17] to drive the jews to the homeland
[1:42:21] you know that they were jewish
[1:42:22] backslidden if he's not in israel
[1:42:24] you know in jerusalem he's backslidden
[1:42:27] that's what your prophet
[1:42:28] said you know you and i are backflip
[1:42:31] we're not in this message
[1:42:33] now come on if this message is not alive
[1:42:35] in us
[1:42:38] come on church this ain't no
[1:42:42] hot blue good times
[1:42:45] now i'm going to say something to you so
[1:42:47] you can go and take what you want to
[1:42:48] about it and listen
[1:42:50] that's why it's died down like it has
[1:42:55] because it's left up to you and i to see
[1:42:57] whether or not we're going to stand
[1:43:02] and all these things is sent among us
[1:43:04] the bible says to what
[1:43:06] to trust
[1:43:10] just as israel lost millions
[1:43:14] but they've gotten them only
[1:43:20] what about you tonight
[1:43:23] brother dale if it's not joyous
[1:43:26] i'd like swat way for a while
[1:43:30] i felt like for six months that i'm
[1:43:32] backslid
[1:43:36] that i'm just totally wondering what's
[1:43:37] going on
[1:43:40] but yet the greatest preaching that god
[1:43:42] ever told
[1:43:47] mistaken pleasure
[1:43:52] yeah i stand like a backslid but what's
[1:43:55] that got to do with anything
[1:44:01] if you tell me something i'm doing wrong
[1:44:02] i'll just repent
[1:44:04] i have no problems with that i repent
[1:44:07] every day i cry out to god every day
[1:44:10] i've told you what trip four months ago
[1:44:12] i was crying for a revival
[1:44:14] what do you think i've been talking
[1:44:16] about
[1:44:19] but yet some of the greatest revelations
[1:44:26] just come forth
[1:44:30] it's not a hook law it's not a feast of
[1:44:32] the trumpets as we think about it as
[1:44:33] being some kind of a great thing that's
[1:44:35] what i'm trying to get you to see
[1:44:40] it's those horrible things you read
[1:44:41] about
[1:44:45] i'm like these mountains falling these
[1:44:47] fires happening all these things
[1:44:49] was to drive israel back to the homeland
[1:44:55] it wouldn't back you under that only
[1:44:57] type that the prophet said
[1:45:00] coming out of egypt
[1:45:03] there's only a type of this you know
[1:45:05] this is the spiritual happening he said
[1:45:07] and under a spiritual happening hitler
[1:45:09] and mussolini and him is killing
[1:45:11] millions of them
[1:45:12] and the jews are still being tormented
[1:45:14] by the people of the world
[1:45:19] they go over there and make one little
[1:45:21] move and the whole world runs against
[1:45:22] them now
[1:45:23] even the united states and yet these
[1:45:26] bombs falling on israel every day this
[1:45:28] bombing bombing bombing
[1:45:31] and they've got them tied with their
[1:45:32] hands to keep them from being able to
[1:45:34] retaliate
[1:45:38] that you see god's work why because
[1:45:42] there's a few more somewhere that ain't
[1:45:44] got back to israel yet
[1:45:46] and it may take a lot of deaths to bring
[1:45:48] them back to israel but you know what
[1:45:49] that 144 000 ain't going to be in the
[1:45:51] united states
[1:45:54] they're going to be in israel
[1:45:59] and they're going to be hunted down and
[1:46:00] persecuted and killed
[1:46:03] for what they believe under these feasts
[1:46:06] of the trumpets
[1:46:09] you understand me we think it's supposed
[1:46:13] to be joyous in all of this
[1:46:20] it should be in our hearts
[1:46:23] i wish i had divorce it's got better the
[1:46:26] last three services and it's gonna get
[1:46:28] better
[1:46:29] but i don't care if it don't get better
[1:46:32] i'll
[1:46:32] whisper if i have to
[1:46:36] that's the other day so brother they
[1:46:38] wouldn't think anything about retiring i
[1:46:39] said well i turned my toes up
[1:46:44] all right i need concerned about it
[1:46:51] sure would be nice though
[1:46:55] look at number 14.
[1:47:00] that was loose them demons was loosed on
[1:47:02] their hitler now
[1:47:05] under hitler mussolini on the jew right
[1:47:10] everybody with me to get back to the
[1:47:11] homeland
[1:47:13] now read this one
[1:47:18] look what it says paragraph 183
[1:47:24] what was it it's in the cunningness that
[1:47:25] he said he come in by flatteries and
[1:47:27] what
[1:47:28] have he done he is bringing the
[1:47:29] protestant ecumenical council of the
[1:47:32] world churches
[1:47:33] the spirit of antichrist upon both of
[1:47:35] them bringing them to the scholar
[1:47:38] just like they did the other in the hour
[1:47:40] to call the bride
[1:47:42] how loose in the ecclesiastical church
[1:47:45] spirit
[1:47:46] loosed upon what
[1:47:52] remember the denominations is
[1:47:56] the bad guys are we listening
[1:47:59] you know they are the ecclesiastical
[1:48:02] spirit
[1:48:03] that like hitler and mussolini and them
[1:48:05] drove to israel natural to the homeland
[1:48:08] we got to be drove to the homeland
[1:48:11] look what he's saying not upon her
[1:48:13] denominations
[1:48:16] upon the bride
[1:48:19] but here you'll get it the bride will
[1:48:21] not go through that time
[1:48:23] he's not going through the tribulation
[1:48:25] right
[1:48:26] no way she ain't going through the
[1:48:28] tribulation look the next
[1:48:30] make sure you just get where he's saying
[1:48:33] program 189 notice the loosing of this
[1:48:37] ecclesiastical spirit
[1:48:39] now 20 years later after that war
[1:48:44] now remember the war is world war ii
[1:48:47] world war ii was the driving of israel
[1:48:50] to the homeland
[1:48:52] under hitler and mussolini and then
[1:48:53] right
[1:48:55] after that war who's it looks on this is
[1:48:58] 200
[1:48:59] thousand demons right
[1:49:03] it's in the the trumpets there's you
[1:49:05] really don't down read them
[1:49:08] two hundred thousand thousand demons was
[1:49:11] loosed
[1:49:12] under hitler and eichmann and them to
[1:49:14] drive them to the homeland
[1:49:15] and they're loosed on the bride he said
[1:49:17] 20 years later
[1:49:19] after that war so if that war ended in
[1:49:22] 45
[1:49:24] somewhere right
[1:49:29] how about 1965
[1:49:34] them ecclesiastical spirits was loosed
[1:49:36] kind of odd
[1:49:38] that that was the year the prophet was
[1:49:41] winding
[1:49:42] down and bringing his message to the
[1:49:45] finality
[1:49:48] loosed on who looked on the bride
[1:49:51] after that war we see the loose end of
[1:49:53] the queen's astral spirit what under
[1:49:55] the seventh seal the seventh trumpet to
[1:49:57] the jews
[1:50:00] loosed to drive us
[1:50:04] to the message of the hour so that these
[1:50:05] other things can take place
[1:50:07] all right let's read facts go ahead
[1:50:08] number 16.
[1:50:11] paragraph 206 207. oh this group down
[1:50:14] here has got 200
[1:50:15] 000 bound at the river euphrates that
[1:50:19] have been bound for 2000 years
[1:50:21] i also that church has bound the holy
[1:50:24] ghost for nearly two thousand years now
[1:50:26] i know it's talking about organized
[1:50:27] religion
[1:50:30] i know what he's talking about come on
[1:50:32] he's talking about organized religion
[1:50:34] that's what's had it bound
[1:50:36] but see church until you and i are
[1:50:37] turned back to the faith of the fathers
[1:50:40] we're tied up in organized religion
[1:50:42] whether you like it or not
[1:50:44] and until the headstone comes which is
[1:50:46] the seal the opening of the word
[1:50:47] and counts off us individuals
[1:50:51] we're still dealing with organized
[1:50:53] religion
[1:50:55] that's where our trouble is tonight
[1:50:57] we've been taught
[1:50:58] this what
[1:51:03] brother dale i don't understand you
[1:51:05] because the feast of the trump is going
[1:51:07] to be a joyous
[1:51:08] happy time and you brought it through as
[1:51:11] eichmann and hitler and the killings
[1:51:13] down through there
[1:51:14] and then now you've turned around and
[1:51:16] said it's loosed on the bride
[1:51:20] i didn't say it
[1:51:24] the prophet said it do you believe him
[1:51:26] amen
[1:51:29] it's bound for the holy ghost what's
[1:51:31] happened under the martyrdom back there
[1:51:33] and under the church ages it's been
[1:51:35] bound
[1:51:36] not at the river euphrates but the door
[1:51:38] creeds and dogmas
[1:51:40] that the holy spirit can't work in the
[1:51:42] church because of man-made systems
[1:51:45] but she's going to be liberated she's
[1:51:47] coming back
[1:51:48] that's what the bible said and those two
[1:51:51] meet one another on the battlefield
[1:51:54] lucifer and michael again like in the
[1:51:56] beginning
[1:51:57] they've been bound for 2 000 years
[1:51:59] almost almost 2000 years
[1:52:02] michael is coming back
[1:52:07] michael is going to be here to battle
[1:52:14] paragraph 2 43 the holy spirit has been
[1:52:17] bound by these denominational rivers
[1:52:19] for almost 2 000 years but it's to be
[1:52:21] loosed in the evening
[1:52:23] time by the evening time message
[1:52:28] the holy ghost back in the church again
[1:52:30] christ
[1:52:31] himself revealed in human flesh in the
[1:52:34] evening time he said he promised
[1:52:39] what about it
[1:52:43] under the seventh trumpet look that next
[1:52:46] program 155 then we'll quit
[1:52:50] under the sale of trump it is to israel
[1:52:52] the same as the seventh seal
[1:52:55] was to the church all right
[1:52:59] now let's read that last one and then
[1:53:01] we'll quit blowing up the neck from
[1:53:03] brother which is
[1:53:04] revelation 11.
[1:53:08] revelation 11 what is the seventh
[1:53:10] trumpet it's the same as the seventh
[1:53:12] seal is to the bride
[1:53:14] what happened under their seventh
[1:53:15] trumpet sounded and there was great
[1:53:16] voices and said heaven say
[1:53:18] the kingdoms of this world are become
[1:53:20] the kingdoms of our lord and his christ
[1:53:22] and he shall reign forever and ever
[1:53:25] the kingdoms of this world because when
[1:53:29] you go to the next when you go to the
[1:53:30] great trumpet
[1:53:32] and brother brown said when that great
[1:53:33] trumpet sound
[1:53:35] it'll sound and all nations will gather
[1:53:37] to jerusalem
[1:53:39] that's when the millennium starts
[1:53:42] the great trumpet
[1:53:45] the great trumpet will sound and the
[1:53:47] millennium will take place one day
[1:53:49] isaiah will be fulfilled i got the
[1:53:51] scriptures but look what
[1:53:56] the seventh seal then must be
[1:54:00] and look at me
[1:54:03] this is the only kingdom i'm interested
[1:54:06] in
[1:54:08] i'm not interested in russia and china
[1:54:10] and
[1:54:11] india and houthi i'm interested in this
[1:54:15] kingdom here
[1:54:17] this is the domain that i want him to
[1:54:19] have possession of
[1:54:22] is in this tabernacle that you're
[1:54:23] looking at
[1:54:25] and the gospel trumpet is to sound in
[1:54:28] the last days
[1:54:29] and you and i are to come to the place
[1:54:31] that we yield these
[1:54:33] trump these kingdoms
[1:54:37] no wonder jesus said thy kingdom come
[1:54:39] thy will be done
[1:54:42] you weren't talking about physical
[1:54:43] kingdoms or worlds or land
[1:54:47] you talk about me and you amen
[1:54:51] do you understand
[1:54:54] see then all we're doing is looking at
[1:54:56] what happens to israel to see what's
[1:54:58] happening to you in our listening
[1:54:59] right to see what's happening to you and
[1:55:02] i what to expect
[1:55:03] well then what do you expect
[1:55:06] i expect the holy ghost to be loosed by
[1:55:08] this end time message
[1:55:11] but you know what that means somebody's
[1:55:13] got to preach it
[1:55:16] right somebody's got to preach it
[1:55:20] and then somebody's got to live it
[1:55:28] i know i jumped around a lot but i just
[1:55:29] didn't want to take something about
[1:55:30] trumpets and talk about
[1:55:32] them and talk about it beautiful these
[1:55:34] companies but
[1:55:35] them trumpets have been sounding and
[1:55:36] that's driving israel to the homeland
[1:55:40] killing them to drive them you mean god
[1:55:42] would send that that's what he said
[1:55:44] the only way to get them back to the
[1:55:46] homeland
[1:55:50] i preached a message probably 30
[1:55:52] something years ago
[1:55:54] and i never have believed that the bride
[1:55:56] would go through the tribulation
[1:55:58] since i heard what the prophet had to
[1:55:59] say we all believed it when it's an
[1:56:01] organized religion
[1:56:02] well we didn't know but when i heard
[1:56:04] that prophet say it i never believed
[1:56:06] that the bride would ever go through the
[1:56:07] tribulation period
[1:56:10] but i do believe tribulation with
[1:56:12] patience
[1:56:16] i don't believe that all of the world or
[1:56:18] the bride of christ will be hunted down
[1:56:20] and persecuted i don't believe that
[1:56:23] but i believe some will
[1:56:26] the prophet said this song would be
[1:56:28] physically breath
[1:56:30] lose all now that's what he had to say
[1:56:33] you can argue that and fuss all you want
[1:56:35] to do
[1:56:37] but it ain't going to be no argument
[1:56:39] when you're being hunted down you
[1:56:41] it won't be no good to stan you know
[1:56:43] brother dale told us this let's just
[1:56:44] stand right now we'd be running
[1:56:49] right we'd be running
[1:56:54] but you see before he can take all of it
[1:56:57] jesus christ is going to step on the
[1:56:59] scene
[1:57:00] the prophet said the bride does better
[1:57:02] under what
[1:57:06] persecution we need somebody to argue
[1:57:09] with us
[1:57:14] we need somebody to flush with us
[1:57:19] to find out whether we believe what we
[1:57:21] believe
[1:57:23] you know what
[1:57:28] you don't bother me to get my fuss with
[1:57:30] somebody because i ain't gonna hurt you
[1:57:32] i'm just gonna tell you what i believe
[1:57:38] it may sound like an argument because
[1:57:40] i'm pretty good at words
[1:57:44] but i also know one thing an argument
[1:57:47] ain't never won nothing
[1:57:50] so there's no native article
[1:57:54] just tell people what you believe
[1:57:58] and then let the world worry about the
[1:58:00] rest what are the trumpets
[1:58:03] look like a great joyous time instead of
[1:58:06] that it's horrible killings and
[1:58:09] horrible things happening around the
[1:58:10] world
[1:58:12] that's god's infinite mercy
[1:58:15] and love for israel that's hard to
[1:58:18] understand
[1:58:21] why didn't he just swoop them all up and
[1:58:23] just put them all in a little cubicle
[1:58:25] you know and just
[1:58:26] carry back over to israel set them down
[1:58:31] now i don't have to explain that i don't
[1:58:34] think
[1:58:35] because you know what would have
[1:58:36] happened the next airplane 90
[1:58:38] of them would have been on their way
[1:58:39] back where they come from right
[1:58:42] come on are you serious
[1:58:46] but see when god drove them there now
[1:58:49] that's their home
[1:58:51] their land they're fighting for every
[1:58:55] inch
[1:58:59] how about it are you fighting for every
[1:59:01] inch of ground you can get now
[1:59:03] in this message are you just that
[1:59:05] classically lazy around
[1:59:08] i'm not studying what we got 288
[1:59:11] 288 in the red book anybody have a need
[1:59:15] and never persecutions
[2:00:10] is
[2:00:24] is
[2:00:34] anybody else
[2:00:42] right here
[2:01:02] do you want somebody
[2:01:32] be concerned about
[2:01:48] is
[2:02:16] um
[2:02:39] anybody else
[2:02:58] anybody
[2:03:12] oh
[2:03:16] happy forever
