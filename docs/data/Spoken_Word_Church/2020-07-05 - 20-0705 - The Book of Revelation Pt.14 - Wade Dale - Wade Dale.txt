TRANSCRIPT
========================================
thank you all for coming away or bless you have a good Sunday so far so good we gotta become church and we're gonna hear some good word upstairs good singing it's a new fellowship that's them we own revelation 4 and we will read this here after this I looked and behold the door was open in heaven and we know what that is that's the wrapped ring of the Gentile bride there I got them the Gentile bride not the Jews the Jews are still here the Jews are going to have to get their Redemption after we're gone because God won't deal with both at the same time he deals with one of the other so he blinded the Jews he's getting ready to reveal itself to them but you and I don't have to get out of here but then before that like I said last Sunday this is all the spiritual walk for me and you after this because we'll capture up into the rapture are taken up into the rapture caught up and these has come up hither and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter so in other words it is important to us the hereafter he's talking about because what we're doing this now he took John up into another dimension and he's showing him what's going on in another dimension simply because the four and twenty elders are not alive at the time they're over in another dimension waiting okay to come back to earth see soon they'll come back to earth again revelation 19 I believe with us but right now they're in another dimension the sixth dimension waiting so John was caught up in another dimension so that he could get a revelation number one he said immediately I was in the spirit seen in the spirit so got the spirit to a place and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne so I don't think John was surprised when he got there and just saw one because he saw Jesus sitting on the throne he knew that Jesus was he knew me physically and you know personally he knew who he was so good night okay so physically he knew them and where do practice well here's one telling them okay all right it's 9:45 you taking out my time let's go be home a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne so he was a surprised to see that one and I don't think it was surprised to see Jesus sent him the throne either and it be one person so there's one God sitting on throne right mm-hmm and he that sat on was all that characteristics of revelation one she was garment down to the foot Girt about the paps with a golden girdle of head and his hair was white like wool why did snow is eyes were flame of fire his feet like unto fine brass is burning the furnace into the voice the sound of many waters that's what he met at the first now he's meeting that same person sitting on the throne and he said sat on him look like Jasper and sardine stone or that would be called sardius stone not a sardine like we think sardine stone and there was a rainbow around about the throne in sight like an emerald so we know that that was the same person the same characteristic the program calls it the person each of Jesus Christ I thought there he was sitting there and round about the throne were four and 20 seats and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders clothed in white raiment and they had on their head crowns of gold and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of God all right so you've got in tight Paul Iranians Martin Colombo it was the seven spirits that anointed these men I don't believe it was the seven men sitting there it didn't say man it said seven pillars seven lamps before the throne which are the seven spirits of God not just putting all that together okay he's not separating the church age and then here's Paul no there's the seven lamps and the seven spirits that were in each eight and we know it was what Len Talos feared it was the Holy Spirit it was the Holy Spirit every eight seven spirits of God not spirits of the devil or spirits of false doctrine everybody had truth in their church a if I got that all right now look and before the throne there was a sea of glass likely to crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before behind for beef lamb boxer calf man and Eagle we've been through this through this and through this and here we are showing it right here that it's coming up again and that's the characteristics of what the Holy Ghost so the Holy Ghost is in every one of those people the Holy Ghost is there the double ghost was all also in John John had about them the Holy Ghost he was standing there with a baptism the Holy Ghost looking at these four characteristics that were prevalent ndj we know that the lion the odds the man and the eagle we've been through that we're now in the Eagle Age the fourth beast was like a flying eagle not I'm sitting eagle on it on a rock or sitting eagle on a flying eagle showing that he was already up there in the height looking around yes getting revelation and we know that brother Branham was typing that last person but also we're evil brother mom called us Eagles and then Eclipse grow up to be eagle all right so that's what you and I have to do that's why there's a growth development in your new birth you got to grow into them from a baby eagle to I'm in a baby eagle fall out of the mess and kill yourself but a momma eagle she don't matter how high she gets on the cliff front she just assumes right down because she depends brother Graham says she depends on them to arms or those two wings which is the old and new testaments in his line and the four beasts had six wings about him and they were full of eyes within one eyes eyes of Revelation Sears s te RS not st ste er nuts not s not seizures but seer right so that's what the Holy Ghost did you say well now brother Randall is a seer from the Holy Ghost is to see if si s de are the Prophet brother man told us the profitably and Elizabet was the holy ghost right the four basement six wings full of lies within and their rest not day and night saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty the holy all is no rest right it can't it's always giving you a revelation it's enough you've read giving you a revelation is helping you through your life if he's not having you through your life he's helping it to eat job he's not helping through the job he's your guardian angel when you're outside of the car driving so he's not he is not at rest they are flying and they rest not day and night even at night while you're sleep the Holy Ghost is there interceding for you all right and all the things that you go through holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which was which is and is to come and when those beasts give glory and honor and thanks to him that sat on the throne who liveth for ever and ever the four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship Him that liveth for ever and ever and cast their crowns before the throne saying thou art worthy why do they know he's worthy because he's the Lamb of God you take away the sin of the world they realize he is the savior of all them thou art worthy O Lord to receive glory and honor and power without that's created that's why I listen member Andrew come up this last night listening God is a jealous God he said he was he said I'll have no other gods before me and every time you go and worship another god I'm gonna give you a plate because I'm in reading in chronicles and kings every time they got out of the will of God God sent a plate they when when Josiah and some of the others were Kings that was rest in the land the Philistine states where they was that mysterion state where they would not you know why because God gave him rest but as soon as some other person comes in couch King and does not that witches please have the God God tells the Philistines hey that's the same way with me and you we don't do the right thing what happened I go back to this in my life a lot of times Kush the scene with Mike I Makana comes up and there's Hezekiah and no one has to kind of lose it and they have they haven't Jehoshaphat they haven't Jocelyn they come in Joe hops passes hey I he has all discernment because he said I have said I got four hundred prophets that do my will and they said go up you know Israel I see you taking over and one of them eight horns and all animated about it and then toss some facts like I believe he said in his heart he said you probably paid them pretty well in other words to say what they're saying ain't you got one more that we can count on and they have said yeah but I hate him he always prophesized against me Wayne way the story is that you see in the Bible it talks about how that Makai saw he's looked he said I saw a God sitting in heaven and he said all these people were saying how all these demons he said well demons get around God well yeah thing like spirit came up before God he said I'll go down there and get him four hundred prophets and I'll because the prophets I see I am seeking he'd change his mind he had already prophesied that the dogs would link the chariot that had a half-blood any so that was a prophecy that had to be fulfilled four hundred lion preachers we're trying to tell them that wasn't gonna happen but Makai stepped up and says I saw a lying spirit come before God so she asked why you and I'm going to go through trials and tribulations what I'm saying is we go through trials and tribulations God has allowed the full listening to come into your camp or a Syrian or this or that one because you got kind of a little bit out of the will of God or you got a little complacent or you got a little mad at your neighbor are you brother and then he'll send a little beady-eyed in that's what he did in the Old Testament every time we get out of the will of God the Syrians would show up with the army of fifty thousand people you know they'd take over a city and then then in one in one scripture one of the Kings repents like has a kind of somebody he repents it's that done I'm sorry for what I did well then God just went out there to the Syrians and just killed about 10,000 of them a name like fleeing back to there you see what I'm saying right there's angels working all the time that was God working that was the Holy Ghost working in the Old Testament working in those people and yes he'll let something come upon you to try you make sure that we are right what we're doing and let us know when we're roaming like what we're doing he'll send a little iron or something there but if you'll turn back to God his promise is if you'll turn back to God he said I'm taking all that away from you so the same way here so he said the four beasts had six wings are in those beasts give glory and honor thou art worthy O Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou has created all things so there was the creator god and for thy pleasure they are and were created right so I've always said you know God's not an old man he's a happy young guy and he's standing out there an eternity way back before anything was made and he's like man I wanna and I want to Milky Way and I want to Pluto and Neptune and I want some a Saturday with rings around it and I don't want this just to be a dull planet I want to fish now and he was that was him because he said whatever thing it's for your pleasure they were created yes that's why God didn't create sin he allows them to come in to show his glory and a lot of people kind of figured got it out that way why does he allow well he knows we're human listen if we didn't have God think about where we'd be what girl Andrew said last night think about if you went home and there was no God and there was just evil and there was just what's going on in this world is all you had to depend on think about that what shape would be in but to know that there is a micaiah among them four hundred prophets a true Holy Ghost and a group of people they that matter what four hundred people say can you imagine though him standing there I like to look at scenes their sex two kings one of you them one of Israel they have very powerful jaws effect very powerful four hundred preachers just I mean go on up you can take them and do the horn you're not and you don't have fun with air like this I think we got this thing with and the Lord speaks to Jehoshaphat inside he says listen if we find one more opinion on this thing and one guy the had him in jail they had him in jail they bring him out they hadn't seen him in a house with I hate that every time he comes into this room he prophesized against me well a house out a little guy that's when he prophesied against it he had one true prophet so hey however me and you the same way were to stand in the end time against four hundred four thousand four hundred thousand people that think they're right and if you are you bold enough to Makai you know the one three flat demons if we're the spirit going like I said you'll know tomorrow and they have told him said you're going to prison and you're now giving the bread of affliction giving the water of affliction and I'll see you know we're now able you're gonna get back and makai turned and looked at him and he said if you come back I'm a false prophet right many did he died that day just exactly what Makati had said that's the way we've got to be that's what would come out last night we got to be bold when it comes to now to the Word of God because it's narrowing down there is just a small bride there is a lot of people into messes and there's a lot of people that may be sanctified but there's only one bride there's one group of people it's kind of stand in front of 400 preachers and say you're all wrong you're all wrong you you're not getting it right then they're gonna challenge you just like the big profit that comes up and slapped him in the face and said we're the spirit go you know when I slapped you right and my kind of pretty much said well this wasn't in you wasn't in you if that was the spirit you think of the other women you because they are Mikael was anointed to tell the truth we're doing it in this day to tell the truth yeah we're not anointed to tell something's all right we've got to be able to tell the truth all right then so now revelations five issue one minute till let's read this one scripture will go up front I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed seven seals so we'll get into revelation 5 next time you'll be back in second and I might maybe in your seat so don't look at them all
