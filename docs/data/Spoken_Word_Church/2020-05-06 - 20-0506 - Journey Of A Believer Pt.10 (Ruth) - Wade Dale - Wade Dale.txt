lost it in certain places but people have always wanted to see god and here we are looking right at him so oh we need the musicians to stay up here because my brother forgot one of the most imp one of the most important days of this year and that's his wife just the musicians that's his wife's birthday is today and he forgot it josiah so if you ever get married don't ever forget your wife's

to try it tonight so it will be you can sit in the car and listen just real time it'll come right through your fm radio fm 107.1 107.1 wswd pokemon chart swc so anyway just by way of announcement for sunday and then luis is going to come up and interpret the service today so we can send it to columbia to the brothers in columbia they want to hear a sermon but they want to hear it in their their native language and they want to uh feast on the word of god there they don't have the technology that we have um so much to do live streaming so we're going to try to help them out but let me get let me get started on this we're going to start sunday now i want everybody to listen because we had some people that misinterpreted what brother dale said the other day and literally misinterpreted he never said it not one sentence did he say of this he never said that don't worry about coming sunday morning come sunday afternoon that never was spoken so i don't know how that sometimes we pay attention more to television and stuff like that than we do the preacher so anyway we're starting at 10 o'clock sunday it will be mother's day so we're starting at 10 o'clock now brother terrence will be locking the door at ten o'clock everybody got that am so be here at 9 45 the reason being is is we're going to seat you every other row family sit together the deacons will be sitting families together if you're an individual we're gonna try to keep you six feet apart fill up the sanctuary then we're gonna fill up the downstairs then we're gonna fill up my sunday school class and have it on the two screens downstairs is everybody okay with that okay the reason we want you here by 10 o'clock is and we're going to lock the doors if you come walking in at 10 o'clock and we've got everybody seated we're going to have to reshuffle everything everybody okay with that you understand why we're doing that not to be mean but we don't want somebody to come walking in at 10 10 and we got to reshuffle everything because two or three people or four or five people walk in so be here now you know what just act act like it's a doctor's appointment you're never late to them just act like it's a doctor's appointment don't act like it's church like a doctor deployment be here at 9 45 there will be only one service there will be gifts for all the mothers now that doesn't mean everybody's got a baby every wife gets a gift on sunday um and then if you're not going to be here we'll mail them to you june's already mailing some that we know is not going to be here sunday so everybody got that so far keep your distance no shaking of hands all right got it wash your hands if you are in a high risk if some of our nurses want to come please feel free to come you may need a break but would you please wear a mask just in case all right the rest of you you decide anybody over 61 i think ought to wear one i'm 60. but wash your hands and sister lisa will have a temporal thermometer up here a temporal thermometer in case we need to take a temperature and see if anybody is uh poor jim bless her heart she's sweating hot all the time anyway her temperature may be up but she's okay everybody's good and then look we're going to have that downstairs if you want to stay outside you may it's okay but we now have that set up and that we just got it in today josh and brother joe and and uh brother richard has got it working now and they're going to try to keep through this service go down to their cars but it's fm 107.1 if you'll turn to that you'll get the direct service as it's going on so remember no handshaking and then remember when you get ready to leave the building after sunday morning service no hand shaking and the deacons will escort you row by row just like we do on a wedding or a funeral okay not everybody gathered cause that just defeats the whole purpose if everybody crowds down the aisle so they'll come up to the front and the people in the front will go out the next rows will go out we're going to try that just to see how it works and then i think maybe if everything works okay then we'll do it again okay everybody got that all right start at 10 lock the doors at 10. be here at 9 45 we'll have regular service the sisters can play their instruments we can maybe uh brother aaron if you don't want to do some of y'all that's been playing a lot you might want to step out and let the ones that hasn't played like the twins bella maybe uh if your wife comes sister esther both sister esther's just to give us enough room everybody got that okay and and let them be able to play because they haven't played in months a couple of months and some of y'all have so if you'll just kind of work that out between yourself because i'm not here to to be the song leaders uh you know to be the guide y'all y'all guide yourself as far as playing okay and brother joe's good with that he's the one that you need to talk to anyway so talk to brother joe canada so everybody got that now let's start in our service brother luis will come up we'll we'll get ready to uh to begin but keep everybody in your prayers for this time coming up it will be mother's day weekend as far as i know we're still going to have our june father's day fishing trip uh i don't see where they won't be unless we have something spike real real high but if we'll just keep ourself close to god and i want to make an announcement at the end of the service regarding that because you know during trying times you really tell who you are leaders are not born in peace time leaders are born during times of war or times of battle right all right so we we we know we have the the right leadership with the holy ghost and brother dale but some of us may have felt they were their own leaders so we're going to have a discussion about that but we're not going to interpret it so let's go we're going to stay on journey of a believer part 9 of the book of ruth we did not finish we're going to go through it though again just for our brothers overseas to come up to a point if that's okay and then we're going to look at something that i think is really really awesome when we look at this okay as we looked at the journey of abraham in four parts okay justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost and placing it and we're going to see that in a couple of parts in the bible we've been through that neighborhood we're going through it in ruth and then if we have time at the end of the service we're going to show you how joshua portrays that in the old testament placing of the people where the half tribe and two tribes stayed on one side okay so we'll see that god bless you let's go to first corinthians 10. and to save time we're just going to read verse 11 because we read this last sentence we had a wonderful time with brother duchess this weekend he needs prayer he has no one to back him up and he's having temporary paralysis and his legs so we're just keeping we gave him the prayer cloth and he was very moved that we were that we were doing that for him amen so just keep him in your presence that we're praying first verse 11. and through the holy ghost we're going to see lord i permeable espirito santo our purpose of being here in this hour that we're living father give us this day our daily bread padres save the lord be with the but lord tonight we look to you the author and finisher of ours and we hold on to those promises we thank you for these things jesus name we pray amen amen first corinthians 10 verse 11. now if you read the scripture above that jesus is talking about moses and and then you come up to the scripture here where it says now all these things happened unto them for example and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come aquinas now that's us that wasn't even paul pablo paul was prophesying this is for us a man so it's really really important because this is important that we see the revelation that god's trying to give us in this day you may be seated now if you'll pull up the next slide we were looking at last sunday we looked see the journey of abraham the journey of ruth and not just now we know god is perfected in three years you can't go any higher than having the holy ghost a place it is mistake and brother brown says that is satanic if we don't have character with our power amen so we're going to look at this we've already looked at the journey of abraham uh because the prophet of god tells us that uh about genesis chapter 12 can genesis capitulos god came to abram abraham and abram had to make a decision okay he had to say yes or no or no he had to decide whether to get up and go or stay okay now we're going to see the same thing in the journey of ruth you come to ruth chapter one ruth has to decide whether to go on with naomi okay that's it no emmy or to go back to moab i'm moab okay so she has to come a place of deciding okay so there's justification is justificacion you going and walking in another direction amen amen god forgives you of your pastors and he has to go by your free moral agents just say yes lord i will follow you as abram says lord i'll follow you as ruth says naomi i will follow you amen so ruth is very important it's a beautiful beautiful chapter in the bible amen amen and then we come and look to see the four combat beasts los cuatro las cuatro veces de combatte the lion leon the man the ego that's four all right so we have your all right so now let's read that this quote estacita the next one please the kinsmen redeemer brother he says and this story was written they said yes and all the old manuscripts where they were segregating the bible the holy men when they were trying to put it together los angeles romantic why would the writers and ancient sages accept this book as inspired because there's a hidden revelation in it and in this hidden revelation you catch the real meaning significance and it will bring you close real close to god and i pray my whole soul this morning how but it can only be revealed by amen amen so god bless you let's turn to the book of ruth chapter one now we want to show or before we get started now it's kind of strange that there's four characters uh uh uh personas okay naomi persona is an example of the old jewish church it's an example of so now as we read this you keep in your mind that naomi is the old jewish church she has went out of her promised land she lost her brideship she's telling the two girls muchachas the nominal church and the gentiles you got to make a decision she said you got to make a decision because remember the first step is making the decision to make a decision all right so arfa decides she don't want to go any further with god hey man so she turns and goes back into the denomination or where she came from but what did ruth say okay look here roof said whatever god gives you he's going against me whatev wherever you go where you died what a decision we come so that's rude yes telling nails i'm going with you i'm gonna take all this old testament and i'm gonna build on it so there's no way for me to get to the new york times there's no way for me to get to the promised land without going through that old jesus christ in other words the old testament you glory some water bud no i'm good okay you can count some of that if you want it appreciate it okay just start it start out make a decision amen so ruth says i'm going with you and it just so happens when they return to the promised land it wasn't it we see that god is always talking about maturity as brother dale's talking about now el monodel esta orlando the first fruit the whole field is full total they just haven't matured but when that priest waved that sheath before god hey [Music] but we're getting ready to go into the next stage amen amen so let's remember those is that cordemonos that naomi and ruth and orfo went out of the promised land they were out of the promises of god the last promise their old husbands had to die your old husband's got it so you can go and be married to christ but remember how perfect this is i'm perfect naomi doesn't get a husband that's right she's missed that boss knows though that he's got to stay in the kinsman so he could see sanctification sanctification even in abram yesterday in abraham even in rule yesterday you see them doing things amen amen it's not all works but no i want you to be careful that just means the unclean spirit went out amen amen and you've become under a religious order you stay in trouble and if you stay there remember none of these people stayed where they were kept moving kept moving everybody god wants you to move man if you stop guess who shows up because remember but when you take him out then you let boaz do the work we'll get to that we're going to cut through some of this um maybe we can get back to it a little bit later we see that she just happens to show up in bohez's field now brother brown said she was directed by the holy ghost because i don't believe in luck i don't believe in just happening i believe sometimes you talk to the lord you know diablo i was a name already in your book giorgio nombre en tu libro couldn't be took out no me polly nothing to be done not a police academy so why are we worried about what came after this is and that's satan's problem he got a little exalted but that didn't hurt god's feelings your name come out the eternal section i'm talking about satan that's why brother brown said that the father son holy ghost what is this trinity doctrine came from the pits of hell because it was safe they created it knowing though there's only one mean okay and now he turns and says no no there's three what a deceiver but listen our eyes have been opening to me that's one of the great the greatest revelation is there's only one truth the first commandment israel the lord is three three one amen [Music] what a beautiful beautiful picture so here's ruth she goes to this field and boaz just happens to see her boss no i believe there was a poll yeah and we get the attention of everybody her character character character character sometimes that's better than sometimes that's better than than you know you being preached too and not just speaking your character because the character goes out there hey man your character goes outside you're in a different field they may have been many women they musculated but they were i see she's working okay he didn't have to go to her house to find her in contrary she was working in the field she wasn't out there complaining with the little group over here complaining about their government she had a heart of a servant what is sanctification so ruth had to come through this position god christ caught his attention and he said hey hey hey my my men my my preachers hombres my my fivefold ministries go on out there go on out there and give them a handful of purpose give her some give her some apostles prophets pastors by teachers to help my brothers amen because what was she gleaning okay yes i just want you to say that again no weeds i can't remember you can't say we can't remember what weeds is um okay never mind so anyway uh my interpreter just fell down well anna he fell down but remember no listen she wasn't over in the field and she was picking up yes things that weren't wheat because in the morning and not only did she glean the corners where the poor people were hey lost god said okay my five full minutes she's having a hard time cutting those corners out there in the face as you're going through the middle of the field foreign so she can live same way with you and now god gives us handfuls of purpose brother branham says some in one of the quotes he says on purpose about it there's your priest coming out to the field to the roots and you've got you've got the mature yeah food like but jesus christ you can't give yourself the holy ghost so you've got to go to the one that can give it because the preacher can't give it to you teacher you've got to come to a place because you've got on new god that ruth came to be of rest amen we're going to read it boaz said the scottish didn't lose a piece of property in the promised land her property was out in the world but remember and she started gleaning of christ god didn't give abraham the baptism of the holy ghost in tight dion because of the circumcision no no he gave him the circumcision abraham that god believed abraham and abraham believed god same way with ruth ruth out in the field you can read in the old testament looking i'm going is but when god comes on the scene in human flesh melchizedek and abraham right off the bat yeah that's my lord by the communion stars and i'm sure that melchizedek you know he's leaning back in that chair he's full yeah drink milk tomato put some butter on bread [Music] is jesus but he would always recognize there's no greater faith couldn't call him son of david same with ruth tambien you've been fighting for 25 years k because they remember abraham and sarah there's your three is justification of the holy ghost abraham get circumcised just annoyed me had to tell her what to do so paul pablo this is fresh it's just for this paul pablo looks meter in the old testament and writes the new testament so you can't do away with that she's still there i put it i just thought you said he's the inheritance but paul is now gleaning is so now we come to this root resting which is the type of the holy ghost now look what happens at the end of the harvest an el fin de so he crawls up at the top of the heap and lays down he crawls up to the top of the heat brother brown and have plenty of land before he could do the rite of religion [Music] the cloak of the holy ghost and throws it over all he says ruth you stay here tambien right you gotta take root and he goes [Music] i love what brother brown says they're satan satan got you out of the way dwight moody says dwight murray god will only fill those elements who are not full of them he had to get rid of him remember being a type of christ they had to meet him outside the city where was christ crucified outside the city it was at the gate what did god tell abraham you shall possess the gate of your enemies and what was the right of redemption well let's go back to moses and he heads to calvary he has no shoes on him because he's almost got he's almost naked so here jesus christ heads to calvary [Music] abraham had to wait 16 years until isaac got a little lost and he took him to calvary he and brother brother brown said abraham got out of the way just for a second we've got the fire the name fuego i love her man i've been watching now she's a little more mature and i'm going to marry you naomi that's okay you get your part you can have your land back but ah need an error this [Music] because and then that baby was handed to naomi when you and i come to full majority and that child we're not going to nurture that change we're going to give it to israel [Music] in naomi and ruth and boaz boss you know that story they had they had a baby i'm in we're presenting that and they're going to say women it we missed our boys but boaz through the two witnesses are going to say don't worry don't worry this was all done so that i could get a gentile bride will he forget israel i'm in that's a good story i love that story story and that's just kind of a fingernail skimming over this is a pokemon we thank god he took his shoes off at calvary if you got just a few minutes let's go to another store real quick real good story that's okay verse 34. talk about types um we look at numbers verse 34 and what happened is that you've got your 12 tribes and they're getting ready to go over into the promised land now listen what is the promised land the promised land is the baptism of the holy spirit [Music] amen the promise was the promise that's why it's called a promised land it's in the proper plan amen amen you sure don't know yeah okay i can social distance it to you yeah but listen but i quit listening they get a promise in this land yes the land grant the sons of abraham wherever you throw your feet that's why i'm right here at the end times not a circumcision to get the holy ghost circumcision numbers 34. there you go verse 13. now here's moses and moses commanded the children of israel saying this is the land which ye shall inherit by lot which the lord commanded to give unto the nine tribes into the halftras now listen to this for the tribe of the children of reuben according to the house of their fathers and the tribe of the children of god according to the house of theirs have received their inheritance have received their inheritance now look remember it's a half tribe so they had to split the tribe up here amen then joshua then let's go to joshua 1 verse 10. let's read these real quick yes it says then joshua commanded the office of the people saying allo rubenitas and the gates and the half the tribal monasteries joshua's saying this is joshua type of the holy ghost the positioner what i tell you joshua's daddy's name was el papade josue none yeah none christ no no father on this earth he was the son of none yeah let me explain that because okay spanish is different okay and in glass some some jokes you can't really interpret like that you can't that's not a joke well let's play with words why would joshua be the son of nun and him type christ because he was the son of none on the earth christ was never mind so anyway they'll get it some of you that speak english interpret it down there foreign now look in verse 13. remember the word which moses the servant of the lord commanded you according all the mighty men of valor and help them so in other words hosea they all got to go help clear out all the ice until the lord have given your brethren rest verse 15. as he has given you and they also have possessed the land which the lord your god giveth them then you shall return unto the land of your possessions which moses the lord's servant gave you on this side jordan toward the sunrises and they answered joshua saying all that thou command us thus we will do entonces respond yeah let's pull up the see if we can get a picture of this now look this is kind of strange this is the positioning they were in mine didn't you talking too much this is a man different place now look but meet him they were right here i kissed him all right reuben gad and manasseh half tribe ruben god iman land over here because if you'll continue studying beef herder and sheep so they left their they left their kids and they left their possession over here they had on [Applause] remember he was one of the four line ox man and eagle that's why they went across into the promised land is and then we get positionally placed had a girl in our office the other day did not know what cinco de mayo meant anyway so you got luther wesley and pentecost they got the holy ghost uh wesley pentecost they're in the promised land they didn't stay over there there they had to come back over here yes just get the holy ghost and say okay no look at all this language oh there's everything over here diamonds diamonds and don't go over here you know the new city pushes up right here [Music] right out of your jerusalem now look what i'm eating even when you look understand me at the member brother brown type justification thank you baptist holy ghost that's the same certificate is is so the stalk is it's pretty tough and justification i mean the leaves and that's probably and i saw and that stalk oh man you got to keep putting rolls down you got to keep doing it cover the wheat up real quick yes joshua told him josuel es dijo he said look guys meet him you can have your property god said i'm pleased with you luther shall live by faith listen they're this is one of the last sermons what life luther had was justification wesley had sanctification the pentecost had the restoration of the hey the pentecost had the restoration of the gifts coming back into it adding to it but now but now it's the completing now when the resurrection comes the life that lived in them lutherans okay the life just lived in the mountains that went to be taken in before jesus christ glory to god it's our boaz laying on top of the heat mr bullis and we're up there with him no no no no no no no no no we're beside him we're in love praise the lord maybe that'll help you a little bit to see okay we love the holy ghost it's a wonderful thing to have but it's like i was telling brothers it's wonderful to have a baby they're beautiful yeah lovely yeah they're innocent and you can say here and then take that baby and go put it in a room and shut the door oh it was a beautiful amen with what okay weeds no no wheat contributor barley correct it's not us gleaning in the field no more nosotros somebody boast and she is who's harvesting in my field throw a hundred million full ministries through the bride is now leading that's going to end that right now if you want to leave it on brother we're not going to uh we're not going to uh interpret the rest of this but god bless you overseas if you're listening in with the love of the lord and luis if you want to do this more often we'll we'll sure do it i don't mind a bit if they if they're starving we'll we can get we'll get them in the field god will get them in a field amen all right i want to cover a few things that has come to our attention um probably not so much for people sitting here but for for those online and i want to say this with the love of the lord as i said before leaders are not born during peace time they're born during battles we know the holy ghost always wins but we as human beings we have fallacies and we have different things that bother us and and um and opinions are opinions they're just like noses everybody's got one and it's okay if you have an opinion if you want to talk about an opinion brother dale go talk about it to brother dale but i want to admonish you if you put it online if you put it on facebook with your little name on top and your cute little picture beside of it and you tell 600 people that's on your facebook page certain certain things and it's not in agreeance with this church then we bring it to the church because if somebody sees that online they're going to go oh that sister or brother goes to brother dale's church well what are they saying that for that's what i tell you leaders are born i was thinking about this the other day the old saying in football we said you know when the when the going gets tough the tough get going and i've seen this in the handling of the situation of this coronavirus with even with the governors of this united states of america now i'm not bringing politics into this pulpit but i am going to tell you that the person in charge right now is doing the best he can do and if you think you can do better like i said before you jump up there and tell him how to do it but he's doing humanly doing the best he can do and for some of you to make a phone call or make a comment that somebody ought to basically shoot him get rid of him yeah that was said from some people no folks you see that right there that says brotherly kindness that's love the people that hate you and you're supposed to love the people you hate what are you saying to the world i looked at the governors and you see the 50 states president trump said okay governors you handle it because you know what you've got the finger on the pulse of your state whatever you decide we'll back you up if you get out of line we'll correct you and now we see and during this whole pandemic some of the governors are doing a wonderful job and some are not doing so well and some have become a bunch of crybabies now i'm spiritualizing this i'm telling you adversity is supposed to show us where we're at with god famine plagues pestilence has always told me where i'm at good or bad that's right and i work on it this has shown me how good i am and how bad i am it should show you because i'm telling you for people to get online and give their opinions online and make phone calls to people and bastion everybody and i hate to say this but it's mostly female the females of this church have y'all become so hard are you wanting to shoot people you want to get people out of the way you know if you say that i'm just going to say this if you say that trump is the cause of all these deaths what an idiot so the next time somebody dies in a chevrolet accident you need to go to the owner of chevrolet and tell him he's responsible for it see that's the way out to say that's where we've come to that's why i tell you when all this rises up the good get together and bind together the halfway kind of lay out there and then they will not see some from now on we'll not see because you know what you're scared to get out of the house or this is so much easier for me to sit at home in my jammies and watch the service but i want to warn you please don't put stuff online if you have an opinion that's okay but if you put it online and we hear it don't think we won't then it's got to be handled but folks this tells us where we are this shaking always tells me being a christian and you should be a christian should tell you your weaknesses not somebody else's your weaknesses if you want to blame anybody for this blame yourself and i told you that we're you know what nothing happens on this earth i don't believe at this point in my life nothing happens on this earth that we're not connected to i'm talking about the bride of jesus christ it's connected to anything that goes on and as brother dale said many times this may not be the end but look what it does it shows what the government can do it shows what people can do it shows what an uprising can do if they keep these if they keep these states shut you're going to see some civil unrest and they got guns but are we going to be part of that ah are we part of the hate crowd huh come on you know we love brother branham and we say oh we love what he tells us and it's all revelation and boy your sisters are going to hate this brother brown said one of the worst things america could have done was allow a woman to vote now i'm not a woman basher but i'm just telling you what the prophet said you know because you're emotional i tell louise i believe that's why god told me not to have women in this sanctuary one part during this whole pandemic because everybody's nervous and everybody goes to yake yeah about things and you're doing it anyway but i want you to stop it quit bashing people i don't care if it's the devil leave him alone he's going to be right there with you but this adversity tells us where we are it tells us where our weaknesses are it tells us where our strengths are just like just like the governments just like the governors of the united states they're all different we're all different that's what i was talking about placing we're all different in the promised land there was different place things some got oil some can handle it some got this they can handle it god knows what you can handle and what you can't handle but what remember this is a time of revelation i mean people even in even in the world can't keep a secret they got cameras everywhere they got phones everywhere and don't you think they don't know where you're at at this very moment you know i love them preppers that go and buy all this stuff and put it up they build a bunker and they carry their cell phone with them everywhere they go that's just a big old beak and it says come on one more thing before we finish remember we talked about a revival now remember there was a revival of azusa street in 1906 right at the turn of the century we talked about that remember talked about that cycle but when man started rejecting that azusa street movement what'd god do first world war and what happened after the first world war the spanish flu came in that's what they're connecting kind of this to the spanish flu came in and killed millions then what did i tell you got the people started crying out for a deliverer they started crying out so we don't have anything to combat this even brother brown talks about jonah salk how god's hand was in that to help that man develop a vaccine for polio to totally eradicate polio you read those quotes or do you just read the ones you want to read you read those quotes about what brother mom says about a virus and all these different things so now look we see people now rejecting the word of god brother branham came into the healing revival now he's gone off the scene and the bible tells us that remember there'll be no famine for regular food it'll be a famine for hearing of the word of god so now people are rejecting the word there's spiritual wars going on as we speak and look now we got a plague the plague falls so what happens after a plague falls a revival starts because there was a healing revival started right after the spanish flu brother brown comes on the scene there in the in the 40s right after the flu got finished in 1920 21 and there killed millions of people it didn't just kill thousands to kill millions of people because they didn't know how to handle it so what am i saying we're in we're in the right time that we're supposed to be in i think i've said i've said we must create a revival it's not going to come from bastion people and being a halfway christian that you can't be in a revival without the baptism of the holy ghost but if you don't have the holy ghost i've said many times before that was judas's problem now i know the other 11 didn't have the holy ghost but they were predestinated they had a different attitude but judas was so close to them until the day the day the night that he rejected jesus and turned him in they thought he was one of the 12. that's how close the devil is sitting right among us so i'm telling you number one your sisters that don't have they have unregenerated husbands sitting at home filling you full of garbage you need to stop it i'm just telling you from the pulpit you need to stop it because brother dale's going to tell you he would be a little bit more nice maybe i don't know but sometimes he don't hear every hit doesn't hear everything goes on but a lot of times he hears more than we all hear but he's not pleased with all this stuff that's going on on facebook and telephone calls and all this stuff about just being totally arrogant and totally mean about stuff people that's not a christian those those people in that dark age brother brown said they walked willingly into the lion's den and the people that was with them that were supposedly the ones that guarded them and pushed them in they saw so much of a love of god now folks they didn't hear them going well bless god that roman emperor they ought to kill him they ought to knock him off the no they heard jesus christ probably singing amazing grace how sweet to sound and then roman generals throw their sword down and said if they can do it i want what they want does the world want what you want that's my last statement let's stand our feet so you can stop the nonsense just remember one time that's right every how you judge it will be judged and meted back to you so i would be real careful and i'm talking to everybody like i said you inside this building i'm not talking to none of you so you know who i'm talking to next sunday start at 10 o'clock doors will be locked be here at 9 45 deacons will sit the families together there will be gifts for all the mothers please distance yourselves some of you stay downstairs brother terrence and me and and brother bob will be handling that they'll be hand washing downstairs the hand sanitizer wear a mask if you don't feel good if you don't feel good don't come but if you have a job that takes you into these places that are infected please wear a mask we want you being here okay we want we want this to be something we can open up and show the world that we can do it not that we're arrogant but some of you can stay outside if you wish and they do have the fm radio hooked up now 107.1 josh and and brother richard and them have been downstairs listening in the car and it sounds fine josh has got both thumbs up so it sounds good you can listen in there if you want to no shaking of hands and then at the end of the service you'll be escorted row by row out so just you know what sing and worship while we're doing that you know just saying listen this is to me it's a glorious time gloria i mean this time right now this is what we've been looking for we read this in our newspaper exactly a long time ago now we just didn't know it was called coronavirus but we knew something was coming right we knew something was going to bring the government to their knees we knew that and then we go and blame it on everybody else no don't do that i think the bible says pray for those who have the rule over you you'll never see brother branham ever bashing a president or bashing of this or bashing of that he bashes the devil and the sin that we do but but but not a not something you shouldn't do that we shouldn't do that we should not we should be what we should be spokesman for christ not spokesman for the devil amen you love the lord i know we it's almost nine o'clock so we're going to go ahead and dismiss but god bless you and love you with the love of the lord take the name of jesus with you if you need prayer just say a prayer right where you at because you know what this social distancing to me it's i'm telling you it's brought me closer to god when i went to dutch scots this weekend i felt something i never felt before and it was a closeness and then you walk in and you hear all this garbage coming out from in here of bashing people and you wonder what in the world are we so highly revelated that we can't just live the basic word of god right but you know what we will i promise you you'll show your true colors you can try to hide it you can try to bite it you can try to deny it but if you ain't got the goods you're going to be found out and you're going to show who you are we're going to anyway we're either going out or we're going up let's bow our heads to heavenly father we pray lord that you would be with us on the highways lord i pray that what's taken has been taken in love lord that with a little bit of correction father we all need that because you're a wonderful father lord and you want your children to lord as the prophet said as we were going through this adoption and placing the holy spirit comes back to the father and says oh they're misbehaving and then then he comes back and says oh no he's just like the father lord we want that we want to the holy ghost to go back and say we're proud of of this person we're proud to proud to live inside that person lord i pray that you'd be with us be with our pastor lord bless him as now we come up to sunday with all the mother's day we ask you bless each mother lord and all the ones lord that oh that prepare food here and make flowers and clean the church and all these different things lord you know my heart i've never tried to bash females but they are the weaker vessel you know that lord and they're emotional and sometimes that's what gets us in trouble and even us being christians that we're females and sometimes we get in trouble with you for doing things we shouldn't do father forgive us that's all i ask is forgive me search my life and lord let me walk closer to you as i believe that right now this revival is beginning to start not a worldwide not even maybe a church-wide but individuals there'll be individuals that'll stand up above and be that wheat that comes to maturity but thank god there's a field behind that's going to come up also lord i pray that you touch us be with us take care of us as we go from here lord bless us keep that sickness away from us let us be diligent let us be lord sanctified lord i believe i believe your word and it says there's no weapon formed they'll stand against you no weapon form that'll stand against your little bride and i thank you for that lord hide us under your wing take that holy ghost veil and throw it over the top of us lord and keep everything away give us lord strength take care of us until we come back sunday lord and give us a good time in you lord we ask these things in jesus name amen
