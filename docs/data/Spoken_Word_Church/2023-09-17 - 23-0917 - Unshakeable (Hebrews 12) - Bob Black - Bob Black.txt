TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I I think I I had uh kind of started meditating on this this is as we get to this scripture about where Paul's speaking on that heaven and earth will be shaken and um think about think about this topic I think it will go um kind of go right in line with what Brother Andy was speaking on yesterday that we've got to take a stand and don't move so let's just go to the Lord in prayer before we get into this study the Lord would just ask Lord that you'll just Quicken these words to us Lord Jesus and line these up in our heart to give us understanding Lord and I pray God that you're this Lord set the atmosphere today Lord for us to receive from you Lord and that Lord we'll we'll be ready to receive Lord as you speak to our hearts and and speak speak these things to our the different needs that we have Lord just be with brother Andrew this morning Lord and be with all of us today Lord and we just give these things over to you in your name amen and maybe just to set the tone I I'm just looking at this scripture in Psalms chapter 16 8 where David uh crying out in in his in his song I have set the lord always before me because he is at my right hand I shall not be moved and um you know even brother Andrew was speaking yesterday the word should always should take preeminence over everything else in our life the word even though over you know you get to a place where you know you you do not even maybe concerned so much about your comfort or the things of life anymore because the word the word should Trump everything else and as we study these things out about being unmoved and the face of all kinds of obstacles and circumstances and stuff that's really the only way to be unmovable is unshakeable is to put God's word first and to stand upon his word like a rock that you're resting on the rock of Revelation that's unmovable if you've got that unmovable foundation so let's keep that in mind as we study these things out that Paul's saying is we'll just kind of background in verse 18 of Hebrews 12 he said for a year not come onto the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire nor unto Blackness and darkness and Tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of Words which voice they that heard and treated that the word should not be spoken to them anymore think about what a scary thing this was to witness to heard hear the the word of God being spoken sound like a trumpet and all of these things black the the Mount Sinai being covered in darkness and and a very scary situation that Paul's saying we're not we're not at that place now where if you even touch the mountain you're gonna die we've come to a place where God has given us a way to approach him for they could not endure that which was commanded of them so much as a beast beast touched the mountain they shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart and so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and Quake now just to kind of think about this who is Paul talking to to so that we understand this correctly Paul's talking to the in in the whole book of Hebrews that we've been studying out he's talking to the saved Hebrews the ones that are Christians that have accepted Jesus Christ as their Savior and needs some encouragement don't give up you're running a race and so forth he's also talking to unbelieving Hebrews to to convince them that this Jesus that has come is greater than all the angels as he said in Hebrews one he's greater than any messenger he's the one that he's the uh he he's the express image of God he's all these things that Paul laid out all through the Hebrews to convince them of who he is and now he's also now think about this he's also speaking to the Hebrews who will listen to the to the two witnesses there in that Jacob period of Jacob's trouble after the bride is already gone that will look back to the things that Paul has already written that they're not even reading it maybe yet but one day they will and they'll look back to what Paul said and be reminded of all these things that Paul said to convince them of who Jesus Christ is so he's speaking to Hebrews but he's really speaking to all these different classes of Hebrews so that'll help us maybe as we study this out further and they Paul was saying in Hebrews 12 but ye are come unto Mount Zion unto the city of the Living God we've got an approach to these Heavenly things the Heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels that he talked about in Hebrews chapter 1 that we're ministered by Angels he's talking about all this heavenly atmosphere that we've got an approach to to the general assembly and Church of the firstborn now he's talking to these Hebrews that have become Christians they're not they're not just part of like a they're not just Jews anymore they're part of the Church of the firstborn the only begotten of the father he's the Christ was born to start something to so that we can all be part of that one body right which are written in heaven if aren't like Jesus said don't don't be uh don't Rejoice because that you have power he told his disciples don't Rejoice that you have power to cast out devils and all those things but Rejoice that your names are written in heaven so these are the things that Paul is speaking of that we have come to these things and to God the judge of all into the spirits of just men made perfect how are we made perfect by the blood of Jesus Christ that his life could live in us and that's what we have come to that they couldn't come to in the Old Testament and in verse 24 into Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel now think about all these things that speak that that that scene that we were just looking at that God spoke from Heaven at Mount Sinai and his voice caused Moses to quake and everybody was fearful and Abel spoke but now he Paul is telling us that that the blood of Jesus Christ speaks greater things than Abel spoke and where is it speaking from so we've got to understand this frame of reference so that we can understand what Paul's talking about he speaks from The Mercy Seat the blood of Christ speaks better think what did Abel what did Abel speak he spoke I'm innocent now what did Christ's blood speak I'm innocent and I've paid the price I an innocent man that totally innocent paid the price for you for the guilty so that you wouldn't have to stay in judgment and that's what the blood speaks this morning is it Christ died for you and sent his life back into you and it's speaking now on your behalf that when you do something wrong or commit little sins of life that his blood is speaking to cover you as an atonement now see if we can recognize that that's what Paul's speaking of so he's saying in verse 25 see that you refuse not him that speaketh now his life the life that he gave on the cross oh as he died there on the cross and he cried out it is finished as his blood dripped down on the ground and now that blood that life that's in the blood is now speaking back from the word mercy seed and he's saying don't refuse the one that's speaking see that you refused not him that speaketh forth they escaped not who refused him that spake on Earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven speaketh from Heaven he's speaking from The Mercy Seat because the life that was was given on the cross is is not is not on the cross anymore but now he's speaking as a testimony that he has died for you and his life is is covering over his covering over your life amen amen and he said his in verse 26 whose voice then shook the Earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also heaven now you think about his voice his voice in the Old Testament speaking and scaring all the the children of Israel speaking from on Mount Sinai causing Moses to quake and then that same voice that spoke to them speaking there on the cross I got it written here in Matthew chapter 27 and verse 50. Jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up The Ghost and what happened it shook everything that boy and behold the veil of the temple was written and Twain From the top to the bottom and the Earth did quake and the Rocks rent why why did he speak it was the blood he was given his life there on the cross and that that as he spoke that he as he gave up the ghost that blood dripping down as an atonement now now we got a promise here that that uh yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also heaven now you go back to hagiah 267 and that's where Paul is referencing these things and and also Deuteronomy 4 you can read and as you if you want to study these things out but in haggai 267 it says for thus saith the Lord of hosts now again think about who's Paul speaking to he's speaking to the Hebrews the Hebrews and one day there's going to be Hebrews uh during that six seal period where the the Earth is shaking and and there's two witnesses preaching and they're going to be delivering a message that points back to what of course what we believe today but but really points back to what Paul spoke of in the book of Hebrews that we're reading now and this is what hagiah prophesied of he said thus saith the Lord of hosts yet once it is a little while and I will shake the heavens and the earth and the Sea and the dry land and I will shake All Nations and the desire of all Nations shall come and I will fill this house house with Glory saith the Lord of hosts now now what does it mean to shake I've got my little diagram here of the 70th week and you can see bombs dropping and oh this think about that the voice of the message of those two prophets shaken shaken the religion of the day shaking the Pharisees and then the bombs dropping and the whole Earth being shaken during that period is everything is shaken to get what to get to get the the whole earth prepared for the Advent of Christ to return to Christ to return with his bride and ride in and everything will be that's God God's got us so think about what a shaking is a shaking is a significant transformation or upheaval it just shakes everything it transforms everything the Fulfillment of every prophetic expectation all these prophecies leading up and then God comes on the scene and just shakes everything and makes you think different makes things look different shakes your mind to realize that God is vindicating his word the removal of all that is temporary imperfect and corrupt now think about this from a prophetic standpoint think about it from the from the standpoint of you hearing the word that the word is have an effect in your life and it shook you and and all the things that aren't supposed to be there begin to drop away as God's shaking you and the only thing that will remain is the things that cannot be shaken and what's what does that mean that the faith the revelation of Jesus Christ in you will be what's left at the end of it that you believe in God's word and all this world begins to shake away and drop away from yes God's word begins to claim your life and that's what the Sixth Seal is about and you can I'm not gonna we could I'm not going to go too much into this but if you go back and study out Revelations chapter 6 and Matthew 24 let's read Matthew 24 real quick and just not to not to spend too much time on this but it says Jesus said immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the Stars shall fall from Heaven and the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the Clouds Of Heaven with power and great glory and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the Four Winds from one end of Heaven to the other now you think about the whole Earth being shaken to prepare a place for God and his bride to come and live on and Paul said it said in verse 27 and this word yet once more signifies the removing of those things that are shaken I've got here a picture of this that movie that was made about Los Angeles sliding into the sea isn't that interesting they actually made a Hollywood movie about what brother Branham prophesied would one day come to pass as the whole earth is shaken the removing of those things that are shaken as of those things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken May remain and brother Brown said in the layout of seeking Church 8 he said he is going to blast and rock this sin cursed world my brother my sister and there is only one place that can stand that shock and that is in the fold of the Lord Jesus and I would beseech you while God's Mercy is still available to you that you give your whole life unreservedly to Jesus Christ who is the faithful Shepherd will save you and care for you and present you faultless in glory with exceeding great joy now you see the shaking lies ahead there's a shaking going on as you hear the word but there's a shaking like that look at this picture who would want to be here when all of these things happen when the world begins to shake and bonds begin to drop and you know it's a a great scary thing that I think should encourage all of us to make sure that we're at the place that we we're supposed to be in Christ because if you're not in Christ you'll be the only place that cannot be shaken the only place that is unshakable is is in Christ where your whole life is built upon a solid rock of a revelation of Jesus Christ like when Peter when when Peter was sitting there listening to Jesus and Jesus asked him one day who do you say that I the son of man am and he said Thou Art he said fellatian blood is not revealed as to you when when Peter answered back Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God because he he was he was basing everything that he knew upon a revelation that God had given to him and Jesus called us this Parable in Matthew chapter 7. he said therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and do with them I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock and everyone that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be lockened into a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and gray was the fall of it now so what can we get from this lesson if you built your whole life and everything that you are and everything that you ever hope to be is built upon a revelation of Jesus Christ then you have confidence that you are built your life is built upon something that is unshakable you can have confidence and the unmovable unshakableness the immutable counsel of a word of God that's not corrupt that will stand every test of time now if we keep reading Paul said in verse 28 he said wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear knowing knowing that there's there's a price to pay if you don't rest in Jesus Christ for our God is a consuming fire now let's tie this in back with the rest of the scripture Our God is a consuming fire that means that means that let's tie this in with Malachi in Malachi chapter 4 verse 1 he said for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yeah and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up saith the Lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor branch but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness now think about a son s-u-n is a ball of Fire the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall now the reason that we're reading this is there's a lot of people in the message today that say that Malachi 456 says not speaking of what we're we believe it's speaking of but look at look at what Malachi 4 is talking about it's talking about that day that hagiah prophesied of the shaking the burn of the burning of the the God is going to consume all the that he's going to just burn shall burn them up saith the Lord of hosts but before that comes he's going to send a message he's going to send a message that will turn our hearts back to the original face of the Pentecostal fathers and he's in Malachi 4. did I skip over and he shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this saith the Lord of hosts remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him an oral for all Israel with the statutes and judgments behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse and brother Brown said in the layout I see in church 8 he said now when John came as Elijah he turned the hearts of the Israelites the hearts of the children that was then accepting his message the hearts of the fathers to the children but when he comes this time he's going to turn the hearts of the church back to the Pentecostal fathers see it's a vice versa you get it now read it now let's let's see what brother Rams said as we're closing up here talking about shaking talking about something that will be unshakable unmovable and brother Brown said in the message be not afraid he said this is my Ministry that he'd give me a gift and that gift is to shake the church to bring it to a recognition of the coming of Christ The Return of the spirit of God and the church and serge we would see Jesus he said last night I was talking on the subject of expectations tonight I was going to pray for the sick now in the coming part next tomorrow night beginning we want to start on the Evangelistic type of message maybe the coming of the Lord the mark of the beast the Seal of God the 144 thousand the four writers of Revelations well I believe those messages are what we got to get to the people to wake them up shake them to show them that we I see the great results in the seven Church ages I would go through that again if I thought it would help here how the god did bless it now let me warn the people again and again did not expect the last Shake of God in the church to be a universal thing it isn't going to be it's to the church it's the great things that will happen with the people in the little minority that's the little group that God shakes to get ready to go and sirs we would see Jesus again he said God manifesting himself in his church among his people Jesus said here was God manifested in a man Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the church has come through all kinds of signs well then when God shakes the last sign before them they stare into space I think that's one of the worst things to kind of observe the spiritual condition of the age is that people just don't want to be in church anymore they just don't want the word anymore and when it's shaking right in their face they stare back at it they won't come to a youth meeting they won't gather together they won't drive the other day we were in the car and we were driving past a bunch of people standing in the rain for a car show and they were out there in for that car show to look at cars but people will rather go to drive to see cars than to come to a meeting where they can hear the word of God when God shakes it before them all they do is stare and say well it doesn't excite me anymore but that's what this message is for is to shake the people to wake them up to realize that God is doing something and the message Messiah he said this gospel ain't going to shake the world it's not world shaking it's Church shaking it shakes the church right now in these last few years the church has been shook like it never and the world knows nothing about it it wasn't supposed to shake the world they're dead anyhow you can't shake them old dead carcasses out there they're twice dead plucked up by the roots how can you do it well I belong to well I go ahead and belong to it see you can't shake them well grandmother did so and so that's no matter what grandmother done what's God doing now this is the light walk in it grandmother lived in her days it was all right but you can't live in her life why don't you wear her clothes then sister maybe that was just a little too ranked but no you want to take her church but you won't wear her clothes and then the world is again falling apart now if you want to read what a message about what Paul is speaking of here in Hebrews chapter 12 go listen to the sermon the world is falling apart it's in that sermon where he says it will be only a handful of people that go in the Rapture I think the statement like that should stir us all up as we read these things that to shake us he said but God hasn't left us without any witness or standard that we should stand by that's this word he said let every man's word be a lie and mine be the truth that's right for both heavens and earth will pass away we're told here that we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved yes sir when all these worldly kingdoms are falling now and the whole world falling apart yet we are baptized into a kingdom that cannot be moved what are you talking about I'm talking about a kingdom that is unshakable we receive a kingdom so when the World falls apart we are born into this Kingdom that cannot fall apart yes it's God's Eternal Word and we stand on that it can never fall apart and we'll close on this uh this quote as the musicians get ready to come forward in his presence brother Brown said this is evangelism this is the time to shake people this is the time that God said there come a time he shook him Mount Sinai one time but they'd come a shaking again that he wouldn't only Shake Mount Sinai but he'd Shake everything that could be moved but did you notice the rest of the scripture but we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved Hallelujah everything that can be shook will be shaken the heavens will shake the Earth will shake heavens and earth will pass away but that word shall never pass away for Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell will never Prevail against it everything that can be shook will be shaken but we receive a kingdom which is the word of God himself and God is his word he don't shake himself amen oh my but we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved it's unshakable said Paul the Hebrew writer God bless you we'll just stop on that thank you [Applause] [Music] thank you all right
