[6:54] whole brother Dale all you brothers all
[6:55] you sisters that worked so hard putting
[6:57] it together you know I'll tell you what
[6:59] we've got some of the best cooks in some
[7:01] of the best cooks in the world are in
[7:02] this message and we certainly appreciate
[7:05] all our hard work you know sometimes
[7:07] when you're you know nice to go to work
[7:10] and you know they in conversation ask
[7:12] what your wife does and you tell them
[7:13] that I stay at home mommy can kind of
[7:15] get like this awkward feeling like they
[7:16] think they're not doing they're getting
[7:18] it off easy but I tell you a
[7:19] stay-at-home mom is not easy it is not
[7:22] easy and they're little they're their
[7:24] pastors and gods their job is just as
[7:27] important right you know a new brother
[7:30] that get behind the pulpit because you
[7:32] know these brothers and things they're
[7:34] preaching the word they're here on on
[7:35] Sundays and on Wednesdays and things but
[7:36] then mothers and pastors are within
[7:39] little ones that congregation every
[7:41] single day every single day so pray God
[7:44] anoint you to live and portray that
[7:47] Spirit of Christ in front of your little
[7:48] ones because they're little sponges and
[7:50] then when they see the Spirit of Christ
[7:53] in us as parents and they wouldn't want
[7:56] to be like you because they'll make them
[7:58] want to be like Christ because they see
[7:59] him in you amen
[8:01] so we're selling a preacher grant again
[8:03] we want to greet you where the Matthew
[8:05] told me to especially greet everyone for
[8:07] him send his love and we just love and
[8:09] really appreciate you sharing the word
[8:11] with you you know brother Dale was just
[8:12] I love preaching here because they're
[8:14] establishing the word and it's easy it's
[8:18] easy preaching you can feel the pull and
[8:19] it's just a wonderful time the Lord we
[8:21] appreciate y'all so much so let's not
[8:23] keep you standing too much longer we'll
[8:25] get right in the word and let's we'll
[8:27] read in two places in Exodus chapter 29
[8:31] is one spot here Exodus 29 and the
[8:36] second spot is gonna be Matthew chapter
[8:41] 4 but we'll read Exodus 29 first
[8:43] beginning here with the fourth verse
[8:47] and Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring
[8:52] into the door of the tabernacle of the
[8:54] congregation and shall wash them with
[8:57] water and that shall take the garments
[9:00] and put upon Aaron the coat and the robe
[9:03] of the ephod and the ephod and the
[9:06] breastplate and gird him with a curious
[9:08] girdle of the ephod and thou shalt put
[9:11] the mitre upon his head and put the holy
[9:14] crown upon the mitre and thou shalt take
[9:17] the anointing oil and pour it upon his
[9:19] head and anoint him amen in Matthew
[9:23] chapter 3 verse 13 then cometh Jesus
[9:29] from Galilee to Jordan unto John to be
[9:31] baptized of him and John forbad him
[9:34] saying I have need to be baptized of
[9:37] thee and comes down to me and Jesus
[9:39] answering said unto him suffer it to be
[9:41] so now for thus it becometh us to
[9:44] fulfill all righteousness then he
[9:48] suffered him and Jesus when he was
[9:50] baptized went up straightway out of the
[9:52] water and lo the heavens were opened
[9:53] unto him and he saw the Spirit of God
[9:55] descending like a dove and lighting upon
[9:58] him and lo a voice from heaven saying
[10:00] this is my beloved Son in whom I am well
[10:04] pleased
[10:05] amen let's go to him in prayer to count
[10:07] Heavenly Father we appreciate you so
[10:09] much we think you're gone for your word
[10:11] and your spirit Lord and we thank you
[10:13] for your truth we thank you Lord for all
[10:14] the saints here Lord and for bringing us
[10:16] together that Lord we can partake of
[10:19] that body Word of the Son of Man father
[10:21] Lord the carcass has been given us in
[10:23] time Lord and has called your Eagles
[10:25] together Lord we've come to be this
[10:27] morning Lord we pray you forgive us our
[10:28] sins may you just help a store to have
[10:31] the mind of Christ both to speak the
[10:32] word and to hear the word father with
[10:34] understanding that we may better serve
[10:37] you Lord and be a voice to this the last
[10:39] generation in Jesus Christ's name we
[10:41] pray ask all these things
[10:43] amen amen god bless yous you're seated
[10:46] I like to title this this morning.this
[10:52] that is written must yet be accomplished
[10:55] in me and I pray that as we go along I
[10:58] may refer back to some of last night's
[11:00] service as it's a background for what I
[11:03] plan on what the Lord has put upon my
[11:05] heart this morning so we find that in
[11:08] this setting here I read in the Old
[11:10] Testament where God has set forth in the
[11:13] law what the priests and what how they
[11:15] were supposed to carry out the service
[11:17] of the Lord and then we find that all
[11:20] that was to be done and natural because
[11:22] they were supposed to portray something
[11:23] throughout the Old Testament they were
[11:25] supposed to you know to bring that that
[11:27] lamb and to make their sacrifices
[11:29] because God was trying to get them to
[11:31] prepare them for the Lamb of God that he
[11:34] was going to sin and we saw that as it's
[11:37] common with flesh and blood things
[11:39] become common to people and they got
[11:41] toward just they just oh here we go
[11:43] again it's time to go up to Jerusalem to
[11:45] worship it's time to to do the sacrifice
[11:48] and it became a thing of routine to them
[11:50] and we must never let the word of God
[11:51] become a routine to us it must always be
[11:54] something fresh you must always be that
[11:56] yearning to go in and partake of the
[11:59] Lord so we find that when Jesus came he
[12:01] had he knew exactly he was the word so
[12:05] we knew that that as he came along he
[12:08] knew exactly what was supposed to be
[12:09] done he was led of the spirit to go to
[12:12] John to be baptized and John was
[12:15] absolutely correct in his assessment
[12:16] that Jesus not only did not need to be
[12:19] baptized because he was sinless but that
[12:21] Jesus should have been baptizing him
[12:22] because it was John that was born a
[12:25] sinner so it was it was John that needed
[12:28] to be baptized of Jesus but yet Jesus
[12:31] knew that John was correct in his
[12:33] assessment but he submitted himself to
[12:35] the word Jesus submitted himself to the
[12:39] Old Testament type because he knew he
[12:42] had to be a priest he knew he had to be
[12:44] a sacrifice so he submitted himself to
[12:47] his own word to fulfill the word and
[12:50] it's so important in this end time that
[12:52] we walk with a consciousness with with
[12:55] an
[12:56] standing to know why we do what we do
[12:59] because in the Old Testament and the
[13:01] Bible is it was coming along they did
[13:04] not know many times what they were doing
[13:06] or why they were doing what they were
[13:07] doing but there comes a time when we're
[13:10] going to get into it as we go along
[13:11] where when the fullness comes then
[13:14] there's a full understanding there
[13:16] should be a full understanding and
[13:18] revelation that comes with the fullness
[13:20] of the word but Jesus told John that
[13:23] suffer this to be so because it becometh
[13:26] us to fulfill all righteousness and
[13:29] we're taught that righteousness is the
[13:32] Word of God so in other words Jesus is
[13:34] telling John suffer baptized me because
[13:37] I've got a word to fulfill so you have
[13:39] to baptize me because if you don't
[13:40] baptize me that type in that shadow is
[13:43] not going to be fulfilled because I'm
[13:45] the sacrifice I'm the Lamb that's gonna
[13:47] give myself for the sins of the world so
[13:49] I've got to be washed
[13:50] I'm a priest I've got to be anointed and
[13:53] we see in our text there that when Jesus
[13:55] follow the word the Spirit came down
[13:57] upon him and led him right into the
[13:59] wilderness he was on a he was on a
[14:01] predestinated path to the cross and
[14:04] nothing was going to stop him not even
[14:07] his own his own desire there in the and
[14:10] in the Garden of Gethsemane when he was
[14:11] sweating the blood and the tears and the
[14:13] dread of he knew what he'd have to go
[14:15] through but he was four ordained and he
[14:19] knew he had to go all the way so nothing
[14:23] could keep that from happening in the
[14:25] message it becometh us to fulfill all
[14:27] righteousness brother Aaron says and in
[14:30] the wilderness you know who I am because
[14:32] God and the wilderness told you there
[14:34] would be a sign following me and you've
[14:37] already borne witness of it and you know
[14:39] it and we know who each other are we
[14:43] know each other think of that Jonathan
[14:46] whenever the blur came to the Prophet
[14:48] and brother Brian brings out that the
[14:50] word came to the Prophet in the water
[14:53] that's where the word came and that is
[14:56] where that first public vindication of
[14:58] the Prophet was was when he was
[14:59] baptizing in the Ohio River it came to
[15:02] the Prophet that same light the pillar
[15:04] of fire came down visible among five
[15:07] hundred or so people
[15:08] just says the pillar fire incarnate came
[15:11] to John the Baptist in front of all them
[15:13] people came to him in the water
[15:16] so he goes on he says we know each other
[15:18] and then it is true that you need to be
[15:20] baptized of me
[15:21] but let's suffer that to be so for John
[15:24] if we are the lights of this day we must
[15:27] fulfill all righteousness all God's Word
[15:31] must be fulfilled by us for this day for
[15:34] it is becoming to us as behaving it's
[15:37] becoming it's like us for we are the
[15:38] true witnesses of God today John we are
[15:42] the lights of this age and if we are the
[15:45] lights of this age there is so much
[15:47] scripture that's got to be fulfilled
[15:49] during this age and it's up to us it's
[15:55] up to us hallelujah it's up to us to see
[15:57] that all God's righteousness is
[15:59] fulfilled and remember righteousness is
[16:02] the word it's up to you to see that
[16:06] God's righteousness is fulfilled Jesus
[16:08] could not come and go to baptize them
[16:10] because that wasn't his part that was
[16:12] John's part G John came up to do his
[16:15] part and then he stopped Jesus and
[16:18] that's where Jesus picked up and did his
[16:20] part and then whenever Jesus fulfilled
[16:22] his part in the flesh then he sent down
[16:24] the Holy Ghost and the church picked up
[16:26] their parts it's remember it's God's
[16:27] Symphony you've got to know what part to
[16:30] play you cannot because if you that is
[16:33] the problem is you cannot impersonate or
[16:36] try and play the light of a word gone by
[16:39] if you try and do that that's
[16:42] denominational you can't do that you've
[16:45] got to do what God has called for you to
[16:48] do in this day so if he we know and so
[16:52] we must know and be conscious and that's
[16:54] why understanding and revelation is so
[16:56] powerful because you've got to know
[16:58] what's expected of you we've come to an
[17:00] age where it's not you're not just doing
[17:02] things like they did in the Old
[17:03] Testament not knowing what they were
[17:05] doing they were just doing it by
[17:06] commandment there were later the spirit
[17:08] to do so but there's come a time where
[17:10] you you were you've got to know why you
[17:13] do it you got to understand
[17:17] if we've come to that our Saints we've
[17:20] come to that our where we have to know
[17:22] what's expected of us
[17:23] because if God expects more of you than
[17:26] in any other age and he does we that we
[17:31] the pressures taken off because he's
[17:32] equipped us with the word that's not
[17:34] been given to any other age because what
[17:37] he requires he each of the equipment he
[17:40] goes on the light of every age should do
[17:42] the same thing we know what is to be
[17:45] fulfilled you who are spiritual and know
[17:48] the Word of God you see what God has
[17:51] promised
[17:52] now the word will not let it without the
[17:55] word will not just come easy but it
[17:57] comes by observation you got to press
[18:01] your way in to do it but yet it behoove
[18:03] with us it is becoming to us to fulfill
[18:07] all God's righteousness we must do it
[18:09] and that comes back to you is job's not
[18:11] just it's not just it don't just come
[18:14] easy it's not you know I believe it you
[18:16] know this was a message but this doing
[18:18] this does not make you a message
[18:19] believer putting it over your heart does
[18:22] not make you a message believer it's got
[18:24] to be in your heart that's where it's
[18:26] got to be now
[18:28] message believers Holy Ghost Phil
[18:30] message believers we'll carry it like
[18:31] this they'll carry it like this they may
[18:33] not they may not carry it publicly at
[18:35] all that's not what it's about but every
[18:38] born-again Christian carries the message
[18:40] there are a carrier of the message and I
[18:43] believe with all my heart that every
[18:45] born-again Christian you should be able
[18:47] to play every born-again Christian and
[18:50] hear the message you should hear the
[18:52] word you should be able to hear
[18:54] revelation you should be able to watch
[18:57] that life to play them and you watch the
[19:00] life of Christ in that individual
[19:01] because every life speaks there's a
[19:04] voice behind every single life and we
[19:08] live in a world of so many voices so
[19:10] many voices try and pull us this way in
[19:12] that way but above every voice in this
[19:14] world there's got to be the voice of God
[19:16] above every bit of it
[19:18] so with partial understanding comes
[19:21] partial reality if you only what you can
[19:25] only walk in the light that only that
[19:26] you know that's it and that's why the
[19:30] church age Saints that's why God when he
[19:33] served as a mediator in the church age
[19:35] to where they had that that's why the
[19:37] God gave Luther the baptism the Holy
[19:39] Ghost even though he preached in titles
[19:41] because he could only walk in the light
[19:43] that he had it wasn't time for that
[19:45] capstone yet you know if you do away in
[19:48] the Luther Age if you do away with these
[19:50] two and try and drop the capstone on
[19:52] there it's not gonna fit it wasn't time
[19:55] they had a partial understanding so they
[19:57] had the partial reality they couldn't
[20:00] take the body change they were expecting
[20:03] it because the book was still still
[20:04] there every age was preached to to
[20:06] expect the coming of the Lord and the
[20:08] God did that and his wisdom because if
[20:10] they knew they'd still be hundreds of
[20:12] years they would be relaxed but see now
[20:14] we've come and realized other the book
[20:16] has been open we've realized that now it
[20:18] really is the end we are the last age
[20:21] there's no age coming after us there's
[20:23] no messenger coming after us the only
[20:26] messenger coming and this here is Jesus
[20:28] Christ if you want to talk about an
[20:30] eighth messenger brother branham
[20:33] introduce Jesus Christ that's it you see
[20:37] Jesus Christ and his fullness it's him
[20:41] that transforms our bodies but there's
[20:45] nobody changed without a soul change it
[20:47] goes from the inside out Abraham had to
[20:49] believe God first and then it took
[20:51] change in the body that's how it always
[20:53] works you get you you get that healing
[20:57] that revelation and then your body will
[20:58] line right up to the word that you
[20:59] believe you speak the word you speak
[21:01] that positive faith my brother West's
[21:04] testimony you know where that brother
[21:05] said it'll be all right and it was he
[21:07] spoke that word and it caught it in
[21:09] faith in his body lined right up to it
[21:12] because if you already healed in the
[21:14] body then what's the point and hold on
[21:15] to anything you've already got it so it
[21:18] happens on the inside out and as brother
[21:21] Graham said how do we know the rapture
[21:22] is not going on all the time because
[21:24] remember the rapture is a revelation so
[21:27] as we get go from glory to glory from
[21:29] word to word and our lives are being
[21:30] changed
[21:31] our body's gonna catch up to it because
[21:33] our bodies are still falling our human
[21:37] spirit is still falling holy ghost still
[21:39] Christians have bad days
[21:41] Holy Ghost field Christians can lose
[21:43] their temper all the ghosts field
[21:44] Christians can say the wrong thing you
[21:47] see but you get up because that Spirit
[21:50] Christ did not come to redeem the spirit
[21:52] he redeems the soul and then everything
[21:55] else is gonna line up right to that soul
[21:57] that's why you start with the Holy Ghost
[22:00] first that is why just like a new
[22:03] Christian we teach our children Jesus
[22:06] Christ rose from the dead he rose up
[22:08] resurrection morning and they believe it
[22:10] and they believe it and that's how it
[22:12] should be but one day when they have
[22:13] their own experience they know it and
[22:16] that's how the message is you tell the
[22:17] kids a message is right the message is
[22:20] the truth God brother Ramzan vindicate a
[22:22] prophet but it takes their born-again
[22:23] experience for them to know that for
[22:25] themselves so in first corinthians 13:9
[22:33] for we know in part and we prophesy in
[22:37] part but when that which is perfect is
[22:40] come then that which is in part shall be
[22:42] done away you know and even our bodies
[22:46] it's not our souls are being perfected
[22:48] by by the Holy Ghost but our bodies
[22:50] aren't perfect yet so when that
[22:52] perfection that translation comes then
[22:54] all this humanistic realm is going to go
[22:56] away all this humanistic personality
[22:58] these rough edges or whatever it may be
[23:01] God's made everyone like that for a
[23:04] reason you know and it's many times to
[23:06] develop our own character whether it's
[23:09] with ourselves or develop someone else's
[23:11] character because the way we are so God
[23:14] knows what he's doing but you know when
[23:16] Abraham took Isaac on the hill and we
[23:18] know the type of how how Isaac had to
[23:20] carry his own wood his own cross and
[23:22] what it type
[23:23] Abraham was just following the
[23:25] commandment of God but yet you can think
[23:27] if you can go back all them thousands of
[23:29] years and see that how you could go and
[23:31] preach to Abraham how you could go and
[23:33] sin and then show him about and then
[23:35] preach to him thinking the end time
[23:37] bride could go back and preach to them
[23:39] patriarchs about what about when you
[23:41] took your son Isaac and it was going on
[23:43] the cross it was Jesus cry
[23:44] and then you can go on and show him
[23:46] whenever God changed you and promise you
[23:48] that seed he was that that's gonna be us
[23:50] and and that's what eternity is gonna be
[23:52] about when we can fellowship and you can
[23:54] talk to it you can talk to Abraham Isaac
[23:56] and all the father's here when David was
[24:00] weeping over Jerusalem when he was a
[24:02] rejected King he when Absalom came and
[24:04] took the kingdom and we know the story
[24:06] and things he was just it was just
[24:07] happenings in the lives of them Saints
[24:10] and it was portraying a spiritual truth
[24:12] in reality and David had a gat to go up
[24:15] on that mountain and look back on the
[24:17] city and cry as a rejected King he had
[24:19] to do it it was an event that had to
[24:22] happen in his life because because the
[24:24] great son of David has done that that's
[24:26] exactly what happened he was rejected so
[24:28] all these different examples of the Old
[24:31] Testament as they were just in part they
[24:33] would just portray Jesus Christ here
[24:35] they're portrayed the bright here they
[24:37] were to portray this this group and that
[24:39] group all in part and they had no idea
[24:42] and the message Christ is the mystery of
[24:45] God revealed his brother Ram says all
[24:49] those things typed him just in tight but
[24:52] yet the mystery was hid then men didn't
[24:55] know what they were doing they only knew
[24:57] they were led by the Spirit to do
[24:59] something now holding it back in the
[25:01] last days for the great revelation think
[25:05] of that he was holding it back all those
[25:08] you know you read of the Bible about
[25:09] David and you read the Bible about the
[25:11] heroes of faith and you we sometimes try
[25:14] and compare ourselves with him and and
[25:15] things but think that what God has done
[25:17] for you he's predestinated you to come
[25:19] in this end time when you can look
[25:20] through the life of Elijah through the
[25:23] Elijah through David through Noah and
[25:25] then he can actually see with
[25:26] understanding that they were just typing
[25:29] you that they were just in part or just
[25:31] a little bit of their life here a little
[25:33] bit of their life here it was building
[25:34] on up and then it became in his fullness
[25:37] in Jesus Christ they were portraying
[25:40] they were looking to Jesus Christ
[25:43] and then in the church ages brother Dale
[25:46] has started all over again you have the
[25:48] Alpha bride and then the church ages
[25:49] were coming on up they were coming on up
[25:51] and they were pointing to a fullness
[25:53] because this is like the Old Testament
[25:55] they were just all had little parts and
[25:56] they all had their part and they lived
[25:58] the word for their day and then the
[25:59] fullness comes just like the Old
[26:02] Testament little parts they were
[26:03] pointing to something and then the
[26:06] fullness came the husband and you know I
[26:09] was thinking whenever it takes to really
[26:13] be able to hear the voice of your
[26:16] husband and I'm talking spiritual you've
[26:21] got to be married to them first whenever
[26:24] you hear the Prophet on a tape when
[26:26] every one of these brothers get up and
[26:27] minister we're supposed to discern the
[26:29] voice of God behind the voice of that
[26:33] man and so if you take it back to the
[26:36] natural and if you're not if you're not
[26:38] married to a man then it's just another
[26:41] person it's just another man's voice but
[26:44] whenever you're married to a man then
[26:46] that's the voice of your husband and you
[26:48] recognize that voice
[26:49] it's that relation but before you really
[26:52] recognize the voice you've got to be
[26:53] married to them first if not it's just
[26:56] another voice it means nothing to you
[26:58] but when you hear the voice of your
[27:01] spouse it catches your attention it
[27:05] catches your attention because there's a
[27:07] relationship there and you can recognize
[27:09] that voice so before we can recognize
[27:13] really the voice of God we've got
[27:15] there's got to be a marriage union or
[27:17] it's just another voice or it's just
[27:19] another preacher or it's just another
[27:21] tape yeah that's that's just brother
[27:23] brands boy but when you're married when
[27:25] you've heard that bridegroom call then
[27:27] you say that's my husband's voice when
[27:29] the words coming across the pulpit
[27:30] that's the Holy Ghost that's not one of
[27:34] these brothers that's the Holy Ghost
[27:35] you're able to discern it because you
[27:37] hear the voice of your husband because
[27:39] there's been a marriage Union
[27:41] if not it's just words if you read a
[27:46] love letter someone else's love letter
[27:49] don't mean nothing to you but when your
[27:52] spouse writes a love letter you're a
[27:53] boyfriend your girlfriend there's a
[27:55] relationship you're gonna read it it's
[27:57] gonna mean something to you and you're
[27:59] gonna hold on to all them words so
[28:02] that's how it's got to be with us so to
[28:05] go on since by expressing to express
[28:07] himself in Moses and David and Joseph
[28:09] and Elijah and on down through you could
[28:11] take each one of those prophets and
[28:13] bring their lives out and show it
[28:14] expressed Jesus Christ perfectly exactly
[28:17] yet never giving his secret in full
[28:20] waiting for to make it known in the last
[28:23] days as he promised waiting for it to be
[28:26] fully disbelieved fully comprehended see
[28:33] before he could express it he was
[28:38] holding it back thinking how how should
[28:40] that make us feel Saints that he held
[28:43] that he predestinated us to this end
[28:45] time to show himself in fullness and
[28:49] absolute fullness to just open the book
[28:52] and his lay it before you because you've
[28:54] got to take a body change and if you
[28:58] fail you have to answer for it because
[29:01] there'll be no excuse the book has been
[29:04] open it was been playing to you it's
[29:06] been preached to you you've had it in
[29:09] your homes
[29:11] there'll be no excuse so what kind of
[29:14] people should we be so John the Baptist
[29:20] when Jesus came to him let's make our
[29:21] way over to st. John chapter 1 whenever
[29:25] Jesus came to him John knew what part he
[29:28] was to play Jesus came through the womb
[29:32] of a virgin because it was written of
[29:35] him to do that it was the time for him
[29:37] to be manifested through a virgin
[29:39] now that word is fulfilled now he's not
[29:41] going to make himself manifested through
[29:43] a virgin anymore that words done so now
[29:47] he promised to make himself manifest
[29:49] through a bride that second fold mystery
[29:52] grab brother Dale there's three fold
[29:54] first was through Jesus Christ he done
[29:56] that he gave now the Holy Ghost and it's
[29:58] that second fold being revealed in his
[30:01] church that's what he's accomplishing
[30:03] now that's the plan of the hour so John
[30:09] knew his place in the scripture because
[30:12] he was questioning fun st. John 1:15
[30:16] John bare witness of him and cried
[30:19] saying this was he of whom I speak he
[30:23] that cometh after me is preferred before
[30:24] me for he was before me and of his
[30:28] fullness we have all received in grace
[30:31] for grace that histone con grace grace
[30:34] John introduced not just the part of
[30:37] Jesus he introduced all of Jesus for the
[30:43] law was given by Moses but grace and
[30:45] truth came by Jesus Christ no man has
[30:48] seen God at any time the only begotten
[30:49] Son which is in the bosom of the Father
[30:51] he hath declared him and this is the
[30:54] record of John when the Jews sent
[30:56] priests and Levites from Jerusalem to
[30:57] ask him who are thou so the people are
[31:00] coming to John they know that something
[31:03] is going on they know that this is
[31:04] something different
[31:05] they haven't had a prophet for four
[31:07] hundred years and all of a sudden a man
[31:10] comes you know wrapped in in sheepskin
[31:12] and and eaten honey and wild locust and
[31:15] and and preaching marriage and divorce
[31:16] and just laying the acts of the root of
[31:18] the tree and preaching serpent seed
[31:20] called them their their father the devil
[31:22] you snakes in the grass he was preaching
[31:25] the word and he wasn't cutting him no
[31:27] slack so they they had figure that there
[31:29] must be something about this man in the
[31:31] scripture where where is he identified
[31:33] right this is this is something so they
[31:36] come and they ask him what you are thou
[31:38] art thou a prophet he answered no no he
[31:43] said in asking and what then art thou
[31:45] Elijah and he said I am NOT art thou
[31:48] that prophet and he said no it's
[31:51] interesting because asked him art thou
[31:52] Elijah and he said no brother I'm said
[31:54] I'm not a prophet but he came John the
[31:58] Baptist within the spirit of empower of
[31:59] Elijah
[32:02] so he goes on he says then they said to
[32:05] him who aren't though that we may give
[32:07] an answer to them that sent us what says
[32:10] thou of thyself
[32:11] now watch John go right in the scripture
[32:12] and identify himself with the word he
[32:15] said I am the voice of one crying in the
[32:18] wilderness make straight the way of the
[32:20] Lord as saith the prophet Isaiah so he
[32:25] didn't say I am the one that a virgin
[32:28] said that would be conceived he found
[32:31] his place in the scripture he found that
[32:34] he was the voice that was crying in the
[32:35] wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[32:37] Lord when they came to Jesus I want to
[32:39] know about what authority he didn't say
[32:41] I'm the voice of one crying in the
[32:42] wilderness that was John jesus knew what
[32:45] he had to do and John knew what he had
[32:47] to do so when John seemed Jesus come he
[32:51] knew that was the climax of his ministry
[32:53] he knew that all that preaching he did
[32:56] all that baptizing he did when this man
[32:58] came to him he knew he could introduce
[33:03] Jesus Christ to the world right he knew
[33:05] he could introduce Jesus Christ to his
[33:07] generation because he knew what part of
[33:11] the scripture belonged to John he knew
[33:13] what part of the scripture belonged to
[33:15] him and then when Jesus comes along he
[33:17] walked right in the order of the word he
[33:19] walked right in the sink
[33:21] of that symphony Jesus knew exactly what
[33:28] was written oh and that is vital in this
[33:32] our Saints it is vital to know what is
[33:35] written of you that is what gives you
[33:38] authority over the devil that is what
[33:40] gives you authority over any kind of
[33:42] false doctrine or false idea of things
[33:45] because remember there's many voices in
[33:46] the land today but no one where you
[33:49] stand brother Branham preached that very
[33:54] well-known sermon this day the scripture
[33:56] is fulfilled in your ears and we see
[33:59] that how how the spirit even worked it
[34:01] to actually replay the drama exactly how
[34:03] it happened in the days of Jesus how
[34:05] that won't how that brother Adam had
[34:07] that brand-new Bible no no the story and
[34:08] the pages are stuck together and it had
[34:10] to be that way so that Roman Catholic
[34:12] priest had to be on
[34:13] platform to give brother branham that
[34:15] his Bible because it was a repetition of
[34:17] the scripture so we see that Jesus when
[34:20] he was able to open up the scripture and
[34:23] open up that family album and go right
[34:26] to where his spot was and he knew where
[34:28] to start and he knew where to stop
[34:30] because it's just as important to know
[34:32] where to start as it is to know where to
[34:34] stop because going too far is just as
[34:36] wrong is not going far enough right it's
[34:39] like praising God for what he's gonna do
[34:40] and like what he did you got to just you
[34:43] got to know we praise God for all that
[34:45] but you've got to know what he's doing
[34:46] now and that's what separates a real
[34:49] Christian we don't look to to to the
[34:51] resurrection just as some kind of
[34:53] historical fact it's a present tense it
[34:55] means something for you today on
[34:58] September the 17th it means something
[35:01] for you today it you should be your life
[35:04] she'll be testifying of that
[35:05] resurrection so in Isaiah 61 whenever
[35:09] they gave Jesus to scroll he didn't go
[35:11] to just Genesis or he didn't go to Noah
[35:15] he went right to what was written of him
[35:17] that spirit led him right to the work
[35:19] because remember Jesus just like God
[35:21] believed his own word they say who was
[35:24] the first believer God was he believed
[35:25] his own work so Jesus believed the word
[35:29] and he subjected himself to the word and
[35:32] that proved it in our text when he went
[35:34] to the river and let a man baptize God
[35:37] let a man baptize him so that he could
[35:40] fulfill the word that's how he subjects
[35:43] himself to the word so he reads
[35:47] Jesus reads these very words the Spirit
[35:49] of the Lord God is upon me because the
[35:51] Lord hath anointed me to preach good
[35:52] tidings it to the meat he has sent me to
[35:55] bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim
[35:56] Liberty to the captives and the opening
[35:58] of the prison to them that are bound to
[36:00] proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord
[36:03] stop he stopped when he stopped he
[36:09] rolled up that scroll and he gave it
[36:10] back to the priest
[36:12] Jesus knew where to stop and I was
[36:15] publishing with a brother Bob the other
[36:16] day and we were talking there's a
[36:18] whenever you read that sentence to
[36:20] proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord
[36:21] there's a comma in that single comma and
[36:26] this just shows you the infinite amount
[36:27] of God and we're living in that comma
[36:29] right now in that comma is the seven
[36:33] Church ages in that comma is brother
[36:36] Aaron's ministry in that comma is the
[36:38] calling out of the bride in that comma
[36:42] is the rapture it's all just one little
[36:45] comma that the Spirit did just like that
[36:47] behind a word that stopping point that's
[36:52] the entire Gentile dispensation right
[36:53] there just in a comma
[36:57] he stopped because Jesus knew where to
[37:01] stop we don't go and try and call out
[37:05] 144,000 the bride knows words stop the
[37:10] bride knows we're not over there trying
[37:13] to get people through - speaking in
[37:14] tongues for the baptism of the Holy
[37:16] Ghost
[37:16] the bride knows where to come pass the
[37:19] bride's past that the bride is past a
[37:23] clothesline religion the bride is past
[37:27] that it's a shaming it still has to be
[37:30] preached but the bride is past that God
[37:33] didn't send a prophet for clothes like
[37:35] he did to get the bride straight but he
[37:36] didn't open the book so that we know how
[37:39] to dress he didn't do that
[37:43] God didn't keep something sealed for six
[37:46] thousand years he did that to keep he he
[37:49] he brother and preached that hardliner
[37:51] they hard that clothesline religion - at
[37:53] first to get the attention to get the
[37:55] people right because God won't even hear
[37:58] your prayer if your heads uncovered
[37:59] right he had to teach the men how to act
[38:02] and how to treat their wives and how to
[38:04] run their household that's that's the
[38:05] ABCs
[38:07] you know I'll her brother I'm on tape
[38:10] you know he said how you oh you've got
[38:12] to how can I teach algebra unless you
[38:14] learn the ABCs
[38:17] so people are still around ABCs how are
[38:20] they ever going to learn a body change
[38:21] how are they ever gonna get revelation
[38:23] for body change when they don't when
[38:25] when they don't even know how to love
[38:27] one another brother Brahim tells a story
[38:31] and he said your ABCs has always
[38:33] believed Christ and he told the story
[38:35] about that one minister that was walking
[38:36] by and he passed by an alley and there
[38:38] was a little boy there praying and the
[38:41] little boy didn't know how to pray so he
[38:42] just sang his alphabet abcdefg and going
[38:46] through and so that minister asked them
[38:48] what are you doing here and he said that
[38:49] he didn't know how to pray and he just
[38:50] said his alphabet and he knew God would
[38:52] put it together you know and what that
[38:56] reminds me of is this message is simple
[38:59] it's just that the carnal mind is people
[39:02] trying to partake of the word trying to
[39:05] partake of it of that bread of that
[39:07] manna that was left in that holy place
[39:09] without being anointed to do so without
[39:11] either being called without having the
[39:13] Holy Ghost or you know that manna is for
[39:15] every born-again Christian it's not just
[39:17] for the ministry it's for every
[39:19] born-again Christian man woman boy and
[39:22] girl needs to be in that holy place in
[39:24] that relationship to be able to go in
[39:27] there and God make himself known to you
[39:30] but that ABCs what it reminds me of is
[39:33] the simplicity of the gospel how it's
[39:36] the ABC but it takes God to be able to
[39:38] put them ABCs together to be able to
[39:41] paint a picture for you to be able to
[39:44] take a word here to take a word here and
[39:46] to display Jesus Christ among you
[39:49] because brother Graham preached the
[39:51] seven seals and he opened the seven
[39:53] seals but to get a lot of the mysteries
[39:55] you've got to dig in forward and
[39:57] backward and that's why I believe God
[39:59] put this message on software and all
[40:01] these things so that we can search it
[40:02] through so that we can make our calling
[40:04] an election sure it's common and he
[40:07] saved it for this endtime so we'll be
[40:10] without an excuse
[40:12] but Jesus knew where to stop listen to
[40:15] this quote out of the Easter seal now as
[40:19] the promised Messiah he quickened every
[40:21] word that was prophesied that he would
[40:24] do heal the sick and now he'd be born of
[40:26] a virgin all that made it is true he was
[40:28] the word manifested here on earth but he
[40:31] could not do this just as a man
[40:34] it taken the Spirit of God dwelling in
[40:36] him to quicken these promises to him
[40:40] think about it he said I hope that we
[40:42] can get this real clear now Jesus being
[40:44] a man himself the body but it took the
[40:48] spirit in him the spirit it's not me
[40:51] that doeth the works it's the father
[40:53] that dwelleth in me he's the one that
[40:54] does the work see Jesus himself was the
[40:57] word because he was before God this is a
[41:01] bad word to use and I hope he could take
[41:02] you right before a crowd but he was
[41:03] predestinated by the foreknowledge of
[41:05] God how God's plan was to be that he
[41:08] would send a redeemer and this redeemer
[41:10] could be his own son so then this was
[41:13] God's promise all the way from the
[41:14] Garden of Eden that Jesus would be here
[41:16] and he was he was a man as a man born of
[41:19] a virgin but it taken the Spirit of God
[41:21] to quicken that word to him and he was
[41:25] the word quickened the word quickened
[41:27] for that hour the time had come that she
[41:30] had to have a redeemer the law had
[41:32] failed other things have failed now it
[41:34] takes a redeemer and he was the promised
[41:35] Redeemer he was quickened by the Word of
[41:38] God so if we if somebody would be
[41:41] looking for a redeemer now they've
[41:42] missed it he's already come you see if
[41:46] somebody's looking for Malachi 4:5
[41:47] they've missed it he's come see how
[41:51] important it is to be spot on the word
[41:54] so when Jesus would read the Old
[41:57] Testament he would read the stories of
[42:00] the Old Testament and be able to see the
[42:03] word by hey be able to see the prophecy
[42:05] behind the story so he would take events
[42:08] and and you can run around call himself
[42:10] a topologist and it's a very scriptural
[42:13] thing because jesus was a typology he'd
[42:16] read the stories of the Old Testament
[42:18] and then bring them over in his day and
[42:20] stand in authority and proclaimed the
[42:24] in authority based on a story about
[42:27] prophecy out of the Old Testament he
[42:30] superimposed it would be a word and
[42:32] here's the definition of superimposed it
[42:34] means to place or lay one thing over
[42:37] another typically so that both are still
[42:39] evident that's a superimposed means you
[42:43] take an event from a long time ago
[42:44] and you lay it right over the very day
[42:46] an hour that we're living in and you see
[42:48] it it's exactly it's another way of
[42:50] saying is history repeats itself
[42:52] that's like superimposing so whenever
[42:58] Jesus read the story of Jonah for
[43:00] example he read the story of Jonah and
[43:03] he read that Jonah was in the belly of
[43:04] the whale for three days and three
[43:05] nights so he being God being the word
[43:09] quicken he realized that Jonah had to be
[43:12] in the belly of the whale for three days
[43:14] and three nights because his experience
[43:16] was a prophecy of Jesus being in the
[43:18] heart of the earth for three days and
[43:20] three nights so Jesus read the story of
[43:22] Jonah said that's me so then he was able
[43:25] after reading the story of Jonah and
[43:26] that's what Matthew records Jesus saying
[43:29] for as Jonas was in the was three days
[43:31] and three nights in the whales belly so
[43:34] shall the Son of Man be three days and
[43:35] three nights in the heart of the earth
[43:37] so Jesus reads the story of Jonah and
[43:40] comes and stands before his generation
[43:42] and said that within you you know you
[43:44] destroy this temple in three days I'll
[43:45] raise it up
[43:46] why was he able to say that because of
[43:49] Jonah think about it the authority that
[43:53] Jesus had to say such a statement was
[43:57] because Jonah was in the belly of the
[43:58] whale so that was quickened to him that
[44:01] that was talking about him so he was
[44:04] able with authority to say destroy this
[44:06] temple raise up in three days because
[44:07] Jonah couldn't be in the bed of the
[44:09] world for two days Jonah had to stay in
[44:11] there for three days I imagine Jonah
[44:13] repented within five minutes of being in
[44:14] Wells Valley but God said no not yet you
[44:18] got to stay there for three days and
[44:19] three nights because I'm coming in flesh
[44:21] in so many hundreds of years or whatever
[44:23] and I've got to be in the belly of the
[44:25] of the earth for three days and three
[44:26] nights so you've got to stay in the well
[44:29] for three days and three nights because
[44:30] you're prophesied about me
[44:32] you see so Jesus was able to read that
[44:36] he was able to read the story of Noah he
[44:39] was able to read the condition of the
[44:41] days of Noah and then be able to say as
[44:43] it was in the days of Noah superimpose
[44:46] it so shall it be in the days of the
[44:49] coming of the Son of Man as it was in
[44:52] the days of lot so shall it be in the
[44:54] days of the coming of the Son of Man he
[44:56] was able to go dig up him Old Testament
[44:58] Scriptures because he knew his place in
[45:01] his hour and was able to prophesy he was
[45:05] able to prophesy from Old Testament
[45:08] that's why stories are not stories
[45:10] that's what stories are prophecies
[45:12] stories you know that there's a story we
[45:15] were fellowship and recently about the
[45:17] the sister that was poor and she kept
[45:20] her son was sinner than pretty pictures
[45:22] and she kept them pretty pictures in her
[45:24] Bible
[45:25] so she was rich but didn't know it she
[45:29] was living below her means that they had
[45:31] called the the you know the state or
[45:33] somebody to try and take care of her and
[45:35] they had where the room tells us a story
[45:36] that she had the money she kept it in
[45:38] her Bible and God sent and you can type
[45:41] this in different ways but God sent some
[45:44] men to her or God sent a prophet to her
[45:46] God sent the five-fold to her to speak
[45:49] the speak what the prophet has already
[45:51] spoken and he they begin to show her
[45:55] that she was rich and begin to explain
[45:58] to her that actually these aren't you
[46:00] this ain't just pretty pictures this
[46:02] ain't just a pretty story this isn't
[46:04] just a bedtime story you tell your kids
[46:06] this is prophecy so we must pay
[46:11] attention to the stories think of what
[46:13] profound meaning the Eagle story has to
[46:16] us today think of the profound you know
[46:19] story meaning all a lot of them stories
[46:21] so you see that people that have that
[46:24] have left the message they get hung up
[46:27] oh brother Ram said this in a story and
[46:29] it wasn't quite right I just held on so
[46:31] much of them stories there was no
[46:34] revelation there
[46:37] it's not just stories it speaks a
[46:41] spiritual application it speaks a
[46:43] spiritual truth but a person's got to
[46:47] have a year to hear let's go to Luke
[46:51] chapter 22 and Luke 22 and even the
[46:57] Gospels is full of what Jesus did that
[46:59] this and that may be fulfilled whenever
[47:04] he seen the money changers in the temple
[47:06] he got infuriated and plated them ropes
[47:08] and beat him out because it was written
[47:10] that he would do that so let's begin
[47:13] with verse 35 and he said unto them when
[47:17] I sent you without purse and script and
[47:19] shoes lacking anything and they said
[47:21] nothing then he said unto them but now
[47:23] he that hath the purse let him take it
[47:25] and likewise his script and he that hath
[47:27] no sword let him sell His garment and
[47:29] buy one for I say unto you that this
[47:32] that is written must yet be accomplished
[47:36] in me and that's where I get the title
[47:39] of this from this that is written must
[47:42] yet be accomplished so he not only knew
[47:46] what he was to accomplish name but he
[47:47] knew what was in the future so look
[47:49] what's after that comma he was reckoned
[47:52] among the transgressors for the things
[47:54] concerning me have an end so there's
[47:57] things that have been written of you
[47:58] that have yet to be accomplished so
[48:00] there's a comma there so you don't have
[48:03] to be you're not either it wasn't
[48:04] written of you to be reckoned among the
[48:05] transgressors and to be beaten and to be
[48:07] and to be crucified that part was a
[48:09] written of you so after that comments
[48:12] thee is this that is written must yet be
[48:14] accomplished in me and that's the
[48:16] testimony of the bride in our mind she
[48:18] started thinking about the resurrection
[48:19] just start thinking about the
[48:20] translation because it's been written of
[48:23] you so you can see what God has brought
[48:27] you through and how he's showed you of
[48:29] himself and showed you his word and yet
[48:31] you can still have a testimony of this
[48:33] that's written that has been
[48:35] accomplished in me this is being
[48:36] accomplished and that will be but I know
[48:38] that that scripture pertains to me so
[48:41] then you can stand with boldness as
[48:42] Jesus did and say this that is written
[48:46] is
[48:46] to be accomplished in me we're gonna be
[48:49] changed we're gonna be translated
[48:52] because it's been written and it's not
[48:55] just me there's a lot written that don't
[48:58] necessarily apply to us right now you
[49:01] see that's the difference it's got to be
[49:03] this that is written is yet to be
[49:05] accomplished in me and you bring it down
[49:09] personal Malakoff pour you're not
[49:12] malachi for
[49:13] I'm not Malachi for brother Branham was
[49:16] Malachi for so you see that in in
[49:20] Revelations 10 and 7 then you have
[49:23] revelations pick up with revelations 10
[49:25] 8 to 11
[49:26] that's the bride this that is written is
[49:29] being accomplished in us the bride's got
[49:33] something to say the bride is speaking
[49:36] it's prophesying so how does the bright
[49:38] you say how does a bride prophesy by
[49:40] saying what's already been said you
[49:44] prophets that when you say there's going
[49:45] to be a resurrection you're prophesying
[49:47] it's already been written whenever we
[49:51] preach and as we as we preach the
[49:53] message whenever you hear the message
[49:54] when you witness about the message when
[49:56] you witness about Jesus Christ you're
[49:58] prophesied it's already been written
[50:02] it's already been spoken but when you
[50:03] say California is going under your
[50:05] prophets on right so this that is
[50:09] written so behind that comma you can put
[50:12] this that is written is yet to be
[50:13] accomplished in me behold that show you
[50:14] a mystery we shall not all sleep but we
[50:17] shall be changed that which is written
[50:20] he's yet to be accomplished in you in a
[50:24] moment in a twinkling of an eye at the
[50:26] last Trump for the trumpet shall sound
[50:27] and the dead shall be raised
[50:29] incorruptible and we shall be changed
[50:32] that that is written is yet to be
[50:34] accomplished tonight that should be your
[50:36] testimony you know it's in there and
[50:39] then you can stand with boldness just
[50:42] that the same boldness Jesus that Jesus
[50:43] was barricaded by the word he couldn't
[50:46] raise before that time because Joe and I
[50:49] couldn't come out of the West see it's
[50:50] all connected
[50:50] Jonah can't come out of the well before
[50:52] three days because Jesus couldn't come
[50:54] out of the earth before that
[50:57] Jesus couldn't come out of the earth
[50:59] before that time because Jonah didn't
[51:01] come out of the belly of the well during
[51:02] that time Jesus is barricaded by
[51:04] scripture he was barricaded by that
[51:06] comma he couldn't quite be he couldn't
[51:07] he couldn't come to to do the day of
[51:10] vengeance he was barricaded by that
[51:12] scripture because Gentile bride had to
[51:14] be called he subject to his own word
[51:18] that is why when we pray when we when we
[51:21] when we we bring the word back to the
[51:23] Lord Lord you promised you promised that
[51:26] that you know that I can apply the token
[51:28] to my family you promised that my
[51:31] children would be saved you promised
[51:33] that I would be healed here it is before
[51:34] you and he's got he's as subject to his
[51:37] own word you know we can say something
[51:40] and then change our mind we're all human
[51:42] and we make mistakes but God doesn't do
[51:43] that he says that he's got to keep his
[51:46] word there's only one thing God can't do
[51:49] we always talk about what he can do and
[51:51] he can do anything but he cannot lie he
[51:54] cannot go back on his word so when this
[51:59] corruptible try to put on incorruption
[52:01] and this mortal shall have put on
[52:02] immortality then shall be brought to
[52:04] pass the saying that is written death is
[52:07] swallowed up in victory Oh death where
[52:09] is thy sting o grave where is thy
[52:11] victory the sting of death is sin and
[52:13] the strength of sin is the law but
[52:15] thanks be to God which giveth us the
[52:17] victory through our Lord Jesus Christ he
[52:22] knew what was written of him and in also
[52:25] in Luke 18:31 then he took unto him the
[52:28] twelve and said unto them behold we go
[52:30] to Jerusalem and all things that are
[52:33] written by the prophets concerning the
[52:34] Son of man shall be accomplished
[52:38] whenever he went to Jerusalem he knew he
[52:41] knew what our faced in the Garden of
[52:42] Gethsemane he knew what our he had come
[52:45] to that's why he was sweating blood and
[52:47] tears blood and sweat the water was
[52:50] separating his veins
[52:52] he knew that he said if it be possible
[52:55] let this cup pass but he knew what he
[52:57] was called to do he was thinking of you
[53:00] he was thinking of you he was thinking
[53:02] of every every attribute that he had in
[53:04] him while he liked that song says while
[53:08] he was on the cross I was on his mind so
[53:15] the prophets wrote that he would come
[53:18] they've been preaching it for thousands
[53:20] of years that he was coming there to
[53:21] portray in their lives and now the
[53:23] prophets have also written that you
[53:25] would come the prophets wrote John wrote
[53:27] that there would be a bride without spot
[53:29] and wrinkle it's already been written
[53:31] so can you identify yourself with that
[53:34] Scripture can you testify that that
[53:36] which is written is being accomplished
[53:39] in to me he's he's earning out my
[53:41] wrinkles he's washing my spots away by
[53:44] the Holy Ghost by that river of life
[53:47] that's flowing out it's being
[53:50] accomplished because he promised it so
[53:54] you had that confidence you stand on the
[53:56] word if you don't have that confidence
[53:57] if that Holy Ghost is not in you to give
[54:00] you that confidence then it is mixed
[54:01] with doubt it's mixed with frustration
[54:03] you are a slave to your emotions you're
[54:06] a slave to how you feel when your feet
[54:08] hit the floor you're a slave to how you
[54:10] feel when somebody cuts you off in
[54:12] traffic and that ruins your day when
[54:13] you're when you get you know your boss
[54:15] may mistreat you on the job you're a
[54:17] slave to your emotions
[54:19] and that's why this world is in such a
[54:22] mess because they act on their emotions
[54:25] in every level to act on their emotions
[54:28] but that see the Christian has that
[54:31] anchor and when our emotions may get out
[54:33] of hand there's an anchor to yank it
[54:35] right back a Holy Ghost filled Christian
[54:39] doesn't feel saved every day the human
[54:42] emotion does not feel saved every day
[54:44] but when you open your Bible and you see
[54:46] what is written of you then that anchor
[54:49] that that soul gets you and you realize
[54:51] I don't care how I feel just like you
[54:55] don't feel you may not feel healed but
[54:57] you are because His Word said you may
[54:59] not feel saved every day when you're in
[55:03] the VAT David didn't feel like a king
[55:05] when he was rejected he was over there
[55:07] crying Lord how could this have happened
[55:08] to me my own son
[55:11] but in God's eyes he was the king when
[55:14] David was the youngest in a family and
[55:16] God anointed him King from his childhood
[55:19] he might he didn't feel very kingly when
[55:22] his brothers was constantly trying to
[55:23] get rid of him and he you know he might
[55:25] have constantly you know he might have
[55:27] gotten in trouble the next day he might
[55:30] have gotten punished by his dad the next
[55:31] day for something he didn't feel very
[55:34] kingly in his emotions but he had to
[55:37] know what was that anointing oil was on
[55:39] him you may not always feel like you're
[55:42] worthy to be Brian nobody's worthy to be
[55:44] the bride but it's not what we did it's
[55:47] what he did in the message things that
[55:51] are to be he said now if we are those
[55:54] attributes of God we cannot live by
[55:56] Creed's
[55:57] we cannot live by denominationalism we
[55:59] must live by the word because the bride
[56:02] is part of the bridegroom like any wife
[56:04] is a part of her husband therefore we
[56:07] must be that word bride and what is that
[56:10] word bride brother Aaron said it is the
[56:13] manifestation of this hour the bride the
[56:18] manifestation of this hour the first
[56:22] pole a second pole didn't by itself
[56:24] produce a bride it was to catch the
[56:26] attention but that third pole is the
[56:30] only one that third time that third pole
[56:33] that gets that rainbow trout that's what
[56:35] that's what gets the bride not a creed
[56:38] or denomination but a living Oracle of
[56:40] God a living attribute of God displaying
[56:42] to the world the attributes of God in
[56:44] the formation of the bride best to be
[56:47] expressed in this hour that we're now
[56:49] living you know some people may think
[56:52] that when you talk so much about a bride
[56:53] that you're taking away from brother
[56:54] branham you or not you are complementing
[56:58] the brand because that was his mission
[57:00] on earth was to forerun the coming word
[57:04] you know and in fellowship we talked a
[57:07] lot about it is just as important you
[57:09] know to not put brother branham where he
[57:12] doesn't go as it is to put him where he
[57:13] doesn't go everything has its place
[57:17] you know and we know and understand that
[57:20] the purpose of the ministry is relevant
[57:22] says it lays it very clearly in the
[57:24] church age book that God calls me and
[57:27] has been faithfully taught and then they
[57:29] preached the message they preach the
[57:34] word but everything that ever comes
[57:36] across this pulpit any pulpit in an
[57:40] acclaimed message church to be able to
[57:41] be taken back to the Bible and the
[57:42] message so there's no reason to be
[57:45] afraid you know in our daily lives we
[57:48] should be sowing that word in our hearts
[57:49] then come to church and get it confirmed
[57:51] come to church and get it you get it get
[57:54] it really enthused share with one
[57:56] another this is exactly what I was just
[57:58] reading this is exactly what I would
[58:00] just heard the brother Branham say it
[58:02] works together you know in second
[58:05] Corinthians that talks Paul talks about
[58:07] how some say there of Apollo's and some
[58:09] say of Paul Paul says already not babes
[58:12] you know he said Paul he said I planted
[58:16] in Apollo's watered but God gave the
[58:19] increase
[58:21] and what a brother ram teaches that the
[58:25] planting was at teaching rain that
[58:26] former rain that came down and he
[58:29] planted and God called God called men to
[58:36] preach the word in water a little
[58:38] brother and said here look what the
[58:39] Bible says here see how perfect the
[58:41] message is see how it is Jesus Christ
[58:43] the same it makes it undeniable
[58:46] if you're really honest with yourself
[58:48] the purpose of the ministry is to make
[58:50] the message and the Bible come together
[58:52] like a woven like that curtain and make
[58:56] it undeniable so that on the day of
[58:57] judgment you won't have an excuse in
[59:01] your face undeniable and then if you
[59:04] disbelieve it's your it's your thing
[59:05] it's your choice make it in your face
[59:08] plain so Jesus knew it had to come to
[59:15] pass it's good let's read John 19 real
[59:19] fast at his crucifixion
[59:25] John 19 26 when Jesus therefore saw his
[59:30] mother and the disciple standing about
[59:32] whom he loved he saith unto his mother
[59:33] woman behold thy son then saith he to
[59:36] the disciple behold thy mother and from
[59:39] that hour the disciple took her into his
[59:40] own home now listen to verse 28 after
[59:43] this Jesus knowing that all things were
[59:47] now accomplished that the scripture
[59:49] might be fulfilled he saith I thirst he
[59:53] couldn't say our thirst until all of
[59:55] them other scriptures were fulfilled
[59:57] that's what the Bible says here Jesus
[59:59] knowing that all things were now
[1:00:01] accomplished there's still some
[1:00:03] scripture that had to be fulfilled so
[1:00:05] then it was time for him to say I thirst
[1:00:06] all that's been done I thirst and every
[1:00:10] bit of his crucifixion every every as it
[1:00:13] is you really study the progression of
[1:00:14] the crucifixion it was a constant
[1:00:17] scripture fulfillment of Scripture all
[1:00:20] the way down he couldn't die till he
[1:00:22] saved that thief he couldn't that
[1:00:25] scripture had to be fulfilled he was
[1:00:27] number he couldn't have been crucified
[1:00:28] by himself he had to be numbered with
[1:00:30] the transgressors he had to be there
[1:00:32] with him thieves Judas had to come
[1:00:35] remember other in God Jesus came from
[1:00:37] heaven to take one Judas came from Hell
[1:00:40] and took the other thief memory say
[1:00:43] there were two crosses Jesus was on one
[1:00:46] Judas hung himself on the other so we
[1:00:49] found that after his crucifixion we
[1:00:53] found that on the day of Pentecost we
[1:00:55] see that the early church did
[1:00:56] exact same thing Jesus did and I want us
[1:00:59] to notice that really only the fullness
[1:01:01] can do that only the fullness whenever
[1:01:04] it comes up in his fullness Jesus could
[1:01:05] then look back through the entire Bible
[1:01:07] and pick up what was written of him all
[1:01:09] the parts and show that it was himself
[1:01:11] right when that alpha bride came on the
[1:01:15] scene of the day of Pentecost we find
[1:01:17] them doing the same thing we found Peter
[1:01:19] saying things like this is you know this
[1:01:21] is that which was written we found
[1:01:23] Philip going up to the eunuch when he
[1:01:25] unit did not have understanding about
[1:01:27] what he was reading he thought maybe he
[1:01:30] was the Isaiah was talking about himself
[1:01:31] that out of the member of the Alpha
[1:01:34] bride was able to go there and say and
[1:01:36] preach the word to him and open up the
[1:01:38] word to his own who he was speaking of
[1:01:40] and I only said that you know he not
[1:01:42] only preached to the eunuch as a way of
[1:01:45] future Philip realized that Jesus was a
[1:01:48] fulfillment of that scripture and was
[1:01:49] able to say it was not John the Baptist
[1:01:51] it's not me it's not Paul this Jesus
[1:01:55] Christ this this is the fulfillment
[1:01:56] he's a fulfillment of that scripture so
[1:02:01] you have Paul did it whenever he came
[1:02:03] and he preached he was able to go back
[1:02:06] and he was able to pull out all kinds of
[1:02:08] types and shadows about they all came
[1:02:09] with Moses under the cloud they all came
[1:02:12] he had to preach Jesus Christ out of
[1:02:13] nothing but the Old Testament so he had
[1:02:17] the fullness of the word to be able to
[1:02:19] go in there and preach Jesus Christ
[1:02:22] - to Jews that held on so tight to the
[1:02:26] law and he had a priest Jesus Christ
[1:02:27] with nothing but the Old Testament but
[1:02:32] do you know you can do that too now
[1:02:34] you can do that too but it that's
[1:02:38] because the his fulness has come that's
[1:02:42] it that's the only reason because when
[1:02:45] that fullness has come that partiality
[1:02:47] understanding is done away with and the
[1:02:49] fullness they but it look back through
[1:02:51] the whole Bible say this is me this is
[1:02:52] me this is me this is this this is that
[1:02:54] but only fullness can do that only when
[1:02:58] Jesus Christ can was he able to pick out
[1:03:00] all the different instances in the Bible
[1:03:02] and Paul did the same thing and now this
[1:03:07] Omega bride brother Ram did the same
[1:03:09] thing you see how they all went back to
[1:03:11] the Bible brother and went back to
[1:03:12] Abraham and Sarah and pulled out by the
[1:03:14] Holy Ghost how they were changed that's
[1:03:17] reading a love letter yeah it's not
[1:03:19] spelled out for you in the Bible that's
[1:03:21] reading a love letter right there that's
[1:03:23] here in the voice of your husband and
[1:03:26] the woman after well and with with
[1:03:29] Jeremiah's with the captivity of Israel
[1:03:32] being a Babylon for 70 years and brother
[1:03:33] my a beluga doubt about that type in the
[1:03:36] seven churches being down in captivity
[1:03:39] and the bride is supposed to take ten
[1:03:43] points and be able to run run with it
[1:03:45] through the scriptures because brother
[1:03:49] Branham hit the high points and you can
[1:03:51] and that I can show you a string of
[1:03:53] quotes where brother Graham talked about
[1:03:54] his constraint of time but did you take
[1:03:57] home and you study it you open your
[1:03:58] Bible you open your Bible on the chloral
[1:04:00] the evening he preaches say and in
[1:04:03] prayer he said Lord I don't have you
[1:04:05] know you the elect caught it I pray that
[1:04:07] your spirit will reveal to them what was
[1:04:11] meant but you got to be married to him
[1:04:15] first that's why it takes the Holy Ghost
[1:04:18] so the brothers there's a continuation
[1:04:21] of that continuity the same continuity
[1:04:25] that we see the paul had a same
[1:04:26] continuity that brother Branham had the
[1:04:28] bride's in that step because remember
[1:04:30] when brother Aaron had a vision of the
[1:04:31] bride the bride was in step of the
[1:04:34] gospel and I believe that the bride is
[1:04:37] in the step of the message that he
[1:04:38] brought it God used him to bring the
[1:04:40] gospel that gospel step and we know when
[1:04:43] he got out up whenever they she started
[1:04:45] getting out of line
[1:04:46] that voice cried out to get back in line
[1:04:51] so just as the Holy Ghost as we're
[1:04:53] talking last night how the Holy Ghost is
[1:04:55] evidence of his resurrection the fact
[1:04:57] that if you're a born-again Christian
[1:04:59] you have the Holy Ghost that proves that
[1:05:01] he rose from the dead even though you
[1:05:02] didn't see it it's proven to you okay
[1:05:05] that fact it just like the revelation
[1:05:08] and the word that's been given to us in
[1:05:09] this endtime proves to us that the books
[1:05:12] been open it proves to us that the seven
[1:05:14] seals have been open because of the
[1:05:16] understanding that God has given us if
[1:05:18] the book would still be sealed we'd
[1:05:21] still be a church age our understanding
[1:05:24] would still be partial we still be
[1:05:27] teaching in parse we still had this
[1:05:28] hanging here and that hang in here and
[1:05:30] we may on a personal level but God knows
[1:05:34] how to iron write that out and lead us
[1:05:35] straight but I'm talking as the church
[1:05:37] as a bride as an overall the truth has
[1:05:40] been given to us the truth has been
[1:05:41] fully disclosed we can't wait on we're
[1:05:45] not waiting on brother Branham to come
[1:05:46] back and reveal anything because if he's
[1:05:49] still got to reveal something for a body
[1:05:51] change then what are we doing and in the
[1:05:57] message marriage of the lamb brother and
[1:05:58] said they had the material on earth now
[1:06:00] to make themselves ready that's what
[1:06:03] we're supposed to be doing now is making
[1:06:05] ourselves ready by the time we see
[1:06:07] brother Branham it's gonna be over with
[1:06:08] for the Gentiles it's gonna be over with
[1:06:11] because that hijacks your faith
[1:06:14] whenever you say he's got to come back
[1:06:18] and give us something else that's like
[1:06:20] saying every part of this guy Evers
[1:06:22] every part of this word is true but this
[1:06:24] part mark 16 with this part that hijacks
[1:06:29] your faith that throws the whole thing
[1:06:31] off you begin to doubt well is this part
[1:06:32] did the scholars purposely add that of
[1:06:36] their own selves you got to have the
[1:06:38] faith that it's all true
[1:06:43] so there's promised to be a translation
[1:06:46] after the fullness has been revealed it
[1:06:48] can only be a translation after fullness
[1:06:50] now we know that there's been an types
[1:06:53] it has been you know Elijah went up and
[1:06:55] Enoch and things but as a group of
[1:06:59] people which still won't be much still
[1:07:01] won't be meaning program said but the
[1:07:04] perfect faith in a perfect rapture are
[1:07:06] connected and the quote perfect faith
[1:07:09] brother Ram said the Word made flesh
[1:07:10] hallelujah the word operating in human
[1:07:12] flesh by physical signs by material
[1:07:15] signs by Scripture signs perfectly to
[1:07:18] bring you a perfect faith for a perfect
[1:07:21] rapture so for the wage you can't have
[1:07:23] the perfect wraps or without having the
[1:07:25] perfect word you can't because if that
[1:07:28] was the case and the Lord could have
[1:07:30] come right here in the middle but he
[1:07:33] couldn't he was holding it back for this
[1:07:34] in time so now that he's equipped you
[1:07:37] with perfect faith now that perfect
[1:07:39] rapture can come but not until that
[1:07:43] perfect faith had come Jesus had perfect
[1:07:46] faith he had it come because he was the
[1:07:48] word and you become the word you become
[1:07:51] the word as you receive the word as you
[1:07:55] receive the word and once you really you
[1:07:58] catch it and you understand it and you
[1:07:59] can raise up so much that you can even
[1:08:02] get the Holy Ghost right when one of
[1:08:04] these brothers are preaching while Peter
[1:08:07] yet spake these words whether it's wet
[1:08:12] while brother Brandon preach these words
[1:08:14] the word is it's that the word has got
[1:08:16] to be preached so as a word is preached
[1:08:18] somebody can say that's for me and get
[1:08:20] the Holy Ghost without an emotion right
[1:08:21] where they're sitting that's the word in
[1:08:24] power that is the word of power and
[1:08:27] demonstration that comes with the
[1:08:28] preaching of the word but if you're
[1:08:31] preaching falls baptism the Holy Ghost
[1:08:33] can't quick anybody
[1:08:36] he says now watch now and he said to us
[1:08:40] if you abide in me and my word and you
[1:08:42] st. John here you can ask what you will
[1:08:44] and it'll be done then recognize your
[1:08:46] position in the scripture as a believer
[1:08:49] see you've got to recognize your
[1:08:52] position as he recognized his position
[1:08:56] you're not testifying that you've got to
[1:08:59] be in the belly of something for three
[1:09:02] days during the heart of the earth or in
[1:09:04] this and that because that wasn't spoke
[1:09:06] for you that was Jesus's word that he
[1:09:10] stood on and that word is true but now
[1:09:15] you've got to work to stand on you see
[1:09:18] you've got to bring your personal you
[1:09:19] got to bring it home so let's talk about
[1:09:23] Enoch we know that Enoch walked perfect
[1:09:27] before the Lord so I want to put a
[1:09:29] little background because brother I'm
[1:09:30] said Enoch knew that he was a type and
[1:09:32] he knew that before the floods came he
[1:09:34] had a given example in the days of Enoch
[1:09:37] just before the flood when Enoch looked
[1:09:39] out there and saw Noah building away on
[1:09:40] that ark Enoch was a prophet Enoch knew
[1:09:44] that he was a type and he knew that
[1:09:45] before the floods came that he had given
[1:09:47] example so one afternoon it was becoming
[1:09:50] to him to take a walk it was becoming
[1:09:52] that he'd take this walk with God and
[1:09:53] somehow that day he changed his path
[1:09:55] instead of going around the side of the
[1:09:57] hill he took the Kings Highway and he
[1:09:59] just kept on walking and they found him
[1:10:01] not because he was not but he'd walked
[1:10:04] up on the Kings Highway and in Hebrews
[1:10:08] 11 by faith Enoch was translated that he
[1:10:13] should not see death she was by faith
[1:10:16] and faith is a revelation
[1:10:17] so by revelation Enoch was translated
[1:10:20] that he should not see death and was not
[1:10:22] found because God had translated him now
[1:10:26] listen to this sentence right here for
[1:10:27] before his translation he had this
[1:10:30] testimony that he pleased God right so
[1:10:33] before your translated you've got to be
[1:10:35] pleasing the Lord that was Enoch
[1:10:37] testimony he pleased God before his
[1:10:41] translation and he was translated
[1:10:42] because he pleased God
[1:10:44] so that leads the question of how do I
[1:10:47] please God it's found in the next verse
[1:10:51] but without faith it is impossible to
[1:10:55] please him if you have no revelation
[1:10:58] it's impossible to please God
[1:11:00] Cain couldn't please God because he had
[1:11:02] a revelation look how Abel please God
[1:11:04] brother baa Abel pleased God with his
[1:11:09] revelation for he that cometh to God
[1:11:13] must believe that he is and that he is a
[1:11:15] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:11:17] Him
[1:11:17] remember Jesus Christ on the Mount
[1:11:19] Transfiguration he had the testimony
[1:11:21] that he pleased God and so much the
[1:11:24] voice came down said this is my
[1:11:25] well-beloved son and whom I'm pleased to
[1:11:27] dwell in hear ye him he was pleased with
[1:11:31] Jesus Christ and now with that in mind
[1:11:33] listen to this quote out of the church
[1:11:35] age book brother Branham said I know
[1:11:38] that works if a man fears that he might
[1:11:41] not please God then let him fulfill the
[1:11:45] word if a man wonders if he'll hear
[1:11:49] those words well done good and faithful
[1:11:51] servant let him fulfill the word of God
[1:11:54] in his life and assuredly he'll hear
[1:11:57] those words of praise the word of truth
[1:11:59] was a criterion then it is a criteria
[1:12:01] now there isn't another standard that
[1:12:03] isn't another plumb line as a world is
[1:12:06] going to be judged by one Christ Jesus
[1:12:07] even so it is going to be judged by the
[1:12:09] word if a man wants to know how he is
[1:12:12] making out let him do as James suggested
[1:12:15] look into the mirror of God's Word so if
[1:12:20] we begin to question Lord my me doing
[1:12:23] this by me making this action by me
[1:12:25] wanting to marry this person but me
[1:12:27] having this desire of my life am i
[1:12:29] pleasing you they said look in the
[1:12:32] mirror of God's Word is it in the word
[1:12:35] that's what we must do
[1:12:38] but we must please him before we
[1:12:41] translate
[1:12:42] and with the only way to please him the
[1:12:44] Prophet said is fulfil the Word of God
[1:12:46] and how can you fulfill the Word of God
[1:12:48] when you don't know what you got to
[1:12:50] fulfill you cannot fulfill the word if
[1:12:53] you're walking in ignorance
[1:12:55] whatever is ignorant to you and you're
[1:12:58] not sure of that's not faith you cannot
[1:13:01] walk in that but when it's all opened up
[1:13:04] before you you can see the lights on in
[1:13:07] this church and I can see exactly how to
[1:13:08] walk out if it was dark and there's
[1:13:11] obstacles and I don't know I only have
[1:13:13] to stick to whatever light I could get
[1:13:15] but God there's a man here that can turn
[1:13:17] on the light and he's turn on the light
[1:13:19] in this antenna there Brian knows how to
[1:13:20] walk and get around this this obstacle
[1:13:22] this obstacle this false doctrine go
[1:13:24] around this way because she's on a
[1:13:26] journey so we're trying to bring it to a
[1:13:30] landing spot but let's think about God
[1:13:33] wrote three Bibles there's three Bibles
[1:13:35] amen
[1:13:35] there's one in the stars he wrote one in
[1:13:40] the pyramid and this Bible that we carry
[1:13:43] around today there's three Bibles and
[1:13:46] the amazing thing about it is that one
[1:13:49] lines up with the other when God first
[1:13:52] wrote the Bible in the heavens he threw
[1:13:54] he throw out the stars in the
[1:13:55] constellations and Enoch by revelation
[1:13:59] was able to look at them stars and he
[1:14:02] had the fullness of the word and with
[1:14:06] that fullness he was able to build a
[1:14:08] pyramid and that pyramid lines up with
[1:14:12] the Stars they're still marveling about
[1:14:14] it today that second Bible lines up so
[1:14:17] perfectly with another one but that
[1:14:18] pyramid just like the constellation that
[1:14:21] pyramid is still a sealed mystery to a
[1:14:24] lot of people they can't figure out the
[1:14:26] pharaohs were buried in it they did this
[1:14:28] with her they thought you know that they
[1:14:29] all kinds of things they have their own
[1:14:31] ideas but Enoch sealed the mystery of
[1:14:35] God in that pyramid and after he
[1:14:39] expressed the fullness because even so
[1:14:42] much that he didn't even put the cap on
[1:14:43] it right so he expressed that fullness
[1:14:47] in that pyramid and then got to come
[1:14:50] home
[1:14:51] he had the revelation of fullness please
[1:14:55] God with that revelation of the fullness
[1:14:57] and God took him home but see Enoch had
[1:15:02] that test when he built the pyramids
[1:15:04] it's it's so it's so marvelous that even
[1:15:06] the prophets of the Bible bring in that
[1:15:08] pyramid language and we'll read some
[1:15:10] scriptures about the stone that the
[1:15:13] builders rejected the prophets are
[1:15:14] talking about the pyramid then brother
[1:15:17] Ram comes and he lays this out in the
[1:15:20] pyramid form and it brings up the
[1:15:22] capstone it brings out the church ages
[1:15:25] type in the pyramid brings out the new
[1:15:27] city that's gonna come down all as a
[1:15:32] pyramid and Enoch had that revelation
[1:15:33] all the thousand years ago so see how a
[1:15:38] fullness equals translation it took the
[1:15:43] the fullness in Enoch the fullness that
[1:15:45] God gave to Enoch he caught that
[1:15:47] revelation and with that revelation
[1:15:48] after he preached so to speak his
[1:15:52] revelation to his generation that
[1:15:54] pyramid even those might have been in a
[1:15:56] sealed form God took him I fear at that
[1:15:58] please God so much in Ephesians 2:20 the
[1:16:04] apostles are still bringing out the
[1:16:05] pyramid talk and are built upon the
[1:16:08] foundation of the apostles and prophets
[1:16:10] Jesus Christ Himself being the chief
[1:16:13] Cornerstone in whom all the building
[1:16:15] fitly framed together groweth unto an
[1:16:18] holy temple in the Lord in whom ye also
[1:16:20] builded together foreign habitation of
[1:16:22] God through the spirit and pyramid means
[1:16:25] fire in the middle and that's what it is
[1:16:29] is God's habitation in you and then
[1:16:33] Peter picks up on it and preaches the
[1:16:34] Statue of a perfect man and the stone
[1:16:38] that the builders rejected has become
[1:16:39] the very hitch stone the corner still
[1:16:42] preaching about the pyramids preaching
[1:16:45] about the constellation about the stars
[1:16:47] job and things talking about the stars
[1:16:49] it's still preached about
[1:16:53] and people still scratch their heads
[1:16:55] about the stars they still scratch their
[1:16:57] heads about in the pyramids and they
[1:16:58] still scratch their heads about this
[1:17:00] it's all three Bibles people are all
[1:17:02] confused about they've got to twist in
[1:17:04] all kinds of astrology and they got it
[1:17:06] twisted the pyramid you know with that
[1:17:08] all-seeing eye on the new world order
[1:17:10] they twist a twist of Scripture and make
[1:17:12] the nominations out of it it's always
[1:17:14] twisted but when you get the correct
[1:17:17] revelation of it
[1:17:18] all three Bibles line up because it's
[1:17:22] supposed to go from heaven in a start on
[1:17:25] earth in the pyramid and from here by
[1:17:29] the Holy Ghost is supposed to go in
[1:17:30] flesh god condescending down praise Lord
[1:17:35] God condescending down from heaven to
[1:17:38] earth and you and back to glory and back
[1:17:42] to earth to live with him forever so you
[1:17:49] have the first two thousand years Enoch
[1:17:51] was changed changed and translated by
[1:17:54] the revelation that he had before the
[1:17:58] great tribulation of the flood so to
[1:18:00] speak as a tire before the flood came
[1:18:02] Enoch disclosed his revelation and God
[1:18:05] changed him and took him home
[1:18:08] second 2000 years Jesus God came down
[1:18:11] himself in flesh the word made flesh he
[1:18:14] was the keystone of the Bible the Word
[1:18:17] made flesh that fullness the fullness of
[1:18:20] the Godhead bodily dwelling in them he
[1:18:23] displayed the fullness he done his work
[1:18:27] as a redeemer he done his work to the
[1:18:30] souls that were in prison he done what
[1:18:32] was written of him and then he rose from
[1:18:35] the dead he took the Old Testament
[1:18:37] Saints with him and he was gone see the
[1:18:40] fullness and translation Enoch had the
[1:18:43] fullness and then he was translated
[1:18:45] Jesus was the fullness and then he was
[1:18:47] translated traveler like a thought so
[1:18:51] what have we come back to again two
[1:18:52] thousand years later Saints
[1:18:55] 2,000 years later the full revelation
[1:18:58] has come through the mouthpiece of a
[1:19:02] vindicated prophet to fully disclose the
[1:19:04] word to a bride for what for translation
[1:19:10] Enoch Jesus and now you have the in time
[1:19:15] bride because we're at the second
[1:19:17] crucifixion of the Son of Man at Geo
[1:19:19] Jesus Christ so then you've got the two
[1:19:23] Jews it doesn't stop there
[1:19:24] you've got after the brides gone you got
[1:19:26] Moses and light she goes back and calls
[1:19:28] 144,000 and discloses the fullness to
[1:19:31] the Jews and they get the Holy Ghost and
[1:19:34] then the two prophets are killed then
[1:19:37] they're resurrected and 144,000 and
[1:19:40] guess what another translation that's
[1:19:43] why God sent a fullness you've got a
[1:19:45] fullness and a translation that's why
[1:19:50] got us in a fullness so we can be
[1:19:52] translated if you want to write through
[1:19:56] scriptures down about the two prophets
[1:19:57] of revelations eleven three to twelve
[1:20:00] and then also first Corinthians 15 12 to
[1:20:03] 26 but Jesus was the capstone of the Old
[1:20:06] Testament until the resurrection of the
[1:20:09] Old Testament Saints and now he's also
[1:20:12] the capstone of the New Testament he
[1:20:14] comes down and Carnot's himself think
[1:20:17] about that he incarnates himself in a
[1:20:20] multi-member bride members of his body
[1:20:23] and no matter how little you think that
[1:20:26] what you do is just so little
[1:20:29] insignificant but it's not insignificant
[1:20:30] to God how many of you have ever had a
[1:20:33] hangnail and things hurt so bad and
[1:20:36] they're so tiny so when one little thing
[1:20:40] gets out of order it can disrupt the
[1:20:42] whole body everybody what you do is so
[1:20:47] important to the Lord the important
[1:20:49] thing is being his will if it's his will
[1:20:51] for you to do something if it's his will
[1:20:53] for you you know whether it's to preach
[1:20:57] or to clean the church or whether it's
[1:20:58] to help out to cook it fellowships to
[1:21:01] leave songs to take up the offering it's
[1:21:03] all in the service for the body
[1:21:06] and you're all in your position so in
[1:21:11] the old testament brother i'm said in
[1:21:14] the room in the message the rapture the
[1:21:16] Old Testament Saints has gone had has
[1:21:18] gone into his presence and paradise
[1:21:20] paradise done away and the Old Testament
[1:21:22] Saints ascended up at his loud voice
[1:21:25] when he screamed and gave up the ghost
[1:21:27] because why the sacrifice the
[1:21:29] propitiation of their sins they had been
[1:21:31] they had waited on believing that the
[1:21:33] perfect lamb was coming that offered the
[1:21:35] sacrifice to lamb and when he died and
[1:21:37] yielded up the ghost he screamed with a
[1:21:40] loud voice and the Old Testament Saint
[1:21:42] to Oak Brother and says watched the
[1:21:45] shout and the voice over here the same
[1:21:48] thing at his coming because remember
[1:21:51] we're at the second crucifixion of the
[1:21:52] Son of Man he goes on and says yielded
[1:21:55] up the ghost and when he did the
[1:21:57] sacrifice was perfect and paradise
[1:21:59] emptied out and the Old Testament Saints
[1:22:02] came to the earth again walked round on
[1:22:04] earth and entered in with him at his
[1:22:07] rapture and what does revelation 10-7
[1:22:11] say in the days of the voice of the
[1:22:13] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:22:14] sound the mystery of God would be
[1:22:15] finished and when Jesus said it is
[1:22:19] finished what followed a resurrection
[1:22:22] and then a translation
[1:22:25] the same thing happening but it only
[1:22:28] came at the fullness in Ephesians 5:14
[1:22:35] it says wherefore he saith awake thou
[1:22:36] that sleepest and arise from the dead in
[1:22:40] Christ shall give thee light brother
[1:22:44] Branham brings out in the church age
[1:22:45] book how they're not dead but they're
[1:22:48] sleeping among the dead so the voice of
[1:22:52] the bridegroom calls out and tells him
[1:22:53] to wake up and to come out of her my
[1:22:56] people because he's calling out a bride
[1:23:00] there's got to be a translation it's
[1:23:04] been typed out on the Bible and we're
[1:23:06] able with eyes of the Holy Ghost to look
[1:23:08] in the scripture and see the types and
[1:23:10] the shadows you see the revelation that
[1:23:12] God had given them and then what
[1:23:13] followed enoch when he built that
[1:23:17] pyramid he built it to perfection every
[1:23:20] stone had its place every stone was
[1:23:23] honed down as it came on up the you know
[1:23:25] the stones at the top were not as big as
[1:23:27] it stones on the bottom it was honed to
[1:23:30] perfection and they say when they when
[1:23:31] he built the pyramids that originally
[1:23:33] had a really like a white limestone or
[1:23:36] something that was just so perfectly
[1:23:37] because you hear brother Graham talk
[1:23:38] about you could put a razor between the
[1:23:40] edge and had a limestone I think the
[1:23:42] French for Napoleon of somebody or
[1:23:44] different civilizations went and
[1:23:46] stripped it off over time but God
[1:23:48] allowed that pyramid to still stand as a
[1:23:50] memorial right all these thousands of
[1:23:53] years it's so important Saints in
[1:23:57] closing that we understand exactly
[1:24:00] what's written of us and that we know
[1:24:01] what to expect and that we know where
[1:24:03] we're at where we've been and that we
[1:24:06] not impersonate a light from another day
[1:24:08] it's got to be current faith and that's
[1:24:10] what real Christianity is it's not
[1:24:13] impersonating something it's not you
[1:24:17] know it's brother Graham even talked
[1:24:18] about people even back then that try to
[1:24:21] carry their Bible like Billy Graham they
[1:24:23] try to walk like Billy Graham they try
[1:24:25] to act like what was a simple Aimee
[1:24:28] McPherson of things try to dress like
[1:24:31] her that's not what it's about
[1:24:33] you know having a had a brother branham
[1:24:36] does not make you spiritual that's neat
[1:24:40] but it's not spirit it doesn't make you
[1:24:42] spiritual is what I'm trying to say
[1:24:44] Robin physical elbows of the Prophet did
[1:24:47] not does not give anyone the Holy Ghost
[1:24:49] he had his own flesh and blood that came
[1:24:51] out of the same room he did that were
[1:24:53] Catholics that had no idea about any
[1:24:56] that want Christians this isn't natural
[1:24:59] Saints it's spiritual
[1:25:02] why did brother Ram come to the
[1:25:04] realization of that he's not the son of
[1:25:06] Charles and Ella Brandon right every
[1:25:09] believer must come to a point in their
[1:25:10] lives where I'm actually God allowed me
[1:25:13] to come through the family I came in for
[1:25:15] a reason but that's not who my real
[1:25:16] parents are he predestinated you at a
[1:25:21] certain time to come in the earth to
[1:25:22] express the voice of God for your
[1:25:24] generation or to be given a chance at it
[1:25:27] and he's given you that opportunity but
[1:25:30] you have to come to realization that God
[1:25:32] is your father that you come from him so
[1:25:35] if you come from him you've got to go
[1:25:37] back to him because he promised that my
[1:25:40] word will not come back to me void when
[1:25:42] he sends that word and the earth is
[1:25:44] gonna accomplish exactly what he said it
[1:25:46] would do it's not gonna come back to him
[1:25:49] void he said heaven and earth will pass
[1:25:52] away but my work I never pass away right
[1:25:55] so when he here word think flesh and
[1:25:57] blood that word has got to come off the
[1:25:59] pages of this Bible Laurie and I know
[1:26:02] that y'all preached that here it's got
[1:26:05] to come off the pages of the word the
[1:26:08] tapes have got to come off the shelf and
[1:26:10] into you into me
[1:26:14] the natural tapes and the natural pages
[1:26:16] of this Bible is gonna burn but the word
[1:26:22] that gets in you is gonna take you out
[1:26:25] of here that is your ticket out of here
[1:26:28] brother Graham said and the flashing red
[1:26:29] lights of his coming that the Train is
[1:26:31] in the block it's time to throw the
[1:26:34] peanuts down and get on the train
[1:26:38] you say peanuts yeah they're the little
[1:26:40] things that's hindering you from you
[1:26:43] walking where you should be with the
[1:26:44] Lord that's peanuts circumstances
[1:26:49] relationships that's keeping you maybe a
[1:26:52] boyfriend or girlfriend that you
[1:26:53] shouldn't really be having but it's
[1:26:55] keeping you from walking like you should
[1:26:57] walk that's peanuts get right with God
[1:27:02] and if they're predestinated they'll get
[1:27:05] right with God and he'll work it all out
[1:27:08] but you got to drop them peanuts you've
[1:27:11] got to drop the complexes you got to
[1:27:13] drop the preconceived notions and god
[1:27:18] help us is and I don't know why I'm
[1:27:20] saying this but God help us as children
[1:27:24] of God to not look at one another god
[1:27:30] help us as children of God to not look
[1:27:32] and be and be kind of put back or put
[1:27:34] off but maybe one another's personality
[1:27:37] but look brother instead look at that
[1:27:39] person's intentions he called he said
[1:27:42] his discernment of spirit look at the
[1:27:45] intentions of that person right so God
[1:27:49] help us this morning to tell you as we
[1:27:51] read the word in our private time or at
[1:27:54] church and hear the word to really
[1:27:56] identify with the word
[1:27:59] to really take it for ourselves and to
[1:28:02] not just try and put it all on brother
[1:28:04] branham try and put it all on brother
[1:28:07] Dale on anybody on your pastor you've
[1:28:13] got to take responsibility for the word
[1:28:16] you've got to take responsibility for
[1:28:19] your actions you got to take
[1:28:21] responsibility for how you live
[1:28:22] according to the revelation that's been
[1:28:24] given we've got to have understanding
[1:28:32] revelation that God just whispers his
[1:28:34] love letter to us and love letter love
[1:28:38] letter does not mean that she can't find
[1:28:42] in the scripture you've got to find it
[1:28:43] in the scripture
[1:28:44] you've got to find it in the message
[1:28:46] it's not just some passing thought some
[1:28:48] mystic thing it's got to be in the world
[1:28:50] but it's the love letter is the
[1:28:54] difference between Abraham Mary Sarah
[1:28:57] they had a son of their old age a
[1:28:58] bracero died had Isaac Rebecca and then
[1:29:01] oh they were changed back young again
[1:29:03] they had to be young before they could
[1:29:06] have a son before Sarah could take that
[1:29:09] long journey to career but with a keen
[1:29:12] desire Sarah she'd I mean she was young
[1:29:14] and beautiful see that's the difference
[1:29:16] between love letter and just reading the
[1:29:19] letter there's a quote already but this
[1:29:23] last quote I'm sorry and then we'll
[1:29:24] close it's actually from yesterday you
[1:29:29] know
[1:29:35] he sit here about the letter vs.
[1:29:38] revelation he said and it was the same
[1:29:40] in the Old Testament but Paul being well
[1:29:43] trained and knew the Scriptures by the
[1:29:45] word a lot of people know this message
[1:29:48] by the word they can quote it to you but
[1:29:53] you see the Scriptures no matter how
[1:29:56] well you know them if the Spirit doesn't
[1:29:59] quicken them and when the spirit
[1:30:03] quickens that letter then it becomes
[1:30:04] life then it becomes substance then it's
[1:30:07] not Alcoholics Anonymous anymore it's
[1:30:09] God delivered you from it and you don't
[1:30:11] have the problem with it that's the
[1:30:14] difference the spirit giveth life see it
[1:30:18] must be quickened or made alive by the
[1:30:21] spirit if the Spirit doesn't live in the
[1:30:24] word and make it a reality to you then
[1:30:29] the letter is just intellectual that's
[1:30:33] where we have so many confessed
[1:30:35] Christians today or professed Christians
[1:30:37] is that intellectual conception of
[1:30:40] Christ
[1:30:42] you know Shipman's one of the brothers
[1:30:44] yesterday and talking about how the word
[1:30:46] has always got to come to the mind first
[1:30:48] it starts intellectually it's okay it
[1:30:51] starts there but when it dropped from
[1:30:53] here to here then we're talking
[1:30:56] something brother and even talked about
[1:30:59] when a woman wants a baby and she can't
[1:31:01] have one he said let her adopt a little
[1:31:02] puppy let her have that little puppy for
[1:31:05] a while and just take that pressure off
[1:31:07] and before she knows it she could be a
[1:31:09] mother so not to liken the word to a
[1:31:14] puppy but just so you understand take
[1:31:17] that temporary take it in your mind
[1:31:19] meditate in it and then even though
[1:31:22] you've got it in your mind it's okay to
[1:31:23] be honest and say God I believe this but
[1:31:26] I know I don't understand it like I
[1:31:27] should make it real to me and when it
[1:31:31] drops that what I call the longest foot
[1:31:33] from here to here when it drops down
[1:31:36] then you've got power then you have
[1:31:38] authority then living the word it's
[1:31:40] everyday life to you
[1:31:42] but when it's just here it's just a
[1:31:43] struggle it's a battle
[1:31:45] you go to work you get pulled on by the
[1:31:46] world you come home you're under better
[1:31:49] influence it's just in and out in and
[1:31:50] out but let it just drop let the word
[1:31:54] drop into your heart and you'll never be
[1:31:57] the same again so god help us this
[1:31:59] morning let's just bow our heads dear
[1:32:03] most gracious Heavenly Father Lord God
[1:32:05] we're so grateful thankful to you Lord
[1:32:06] for your spirit in your word we thank
[1:32:09] you Lord God that you would love us
[1:32:11] enough Lord to come and share yourself
[1:32:13] with us Lord it's not about just knowing
[1:32:16] some intellectual discourse Lord but
[1:32:18] truly knowing you and the power of your
[1:32:21] resurrection where we can speak the word
[1:32:24] brother Graham talked about Lord though
[1:32:25] there's a people come and that'll speak
[1:32:27] the word and it'll flash like lightning
[1:32:29] Lord we've got to come in that speaking
[1:32:32] condition Lord you know all things and
[1:32:34] you know how you're molding us and
[1:32:36] you're shaping us Lord as individuals
[1:32:38] and as churches father Lord all the word
[1:32:41] that's been sowed in his father all
[1:32:42] these years and this church or in any
[1:32:46] church we might have attend and the
[1:32:48] tapes father's been sowed in us all
[1:32:49] these years Lord and now there's gonna
[1:32:51] come a day where we're gonna ask to give
[1:32:53] a reason Lord if we don't get this word
[1:32:55] in us it's got to be in a slore we've
[1:32:58] got to be that written epistle Lord made
[1:33:01] Lord read and known of all men has got
[1:33:03] to take flesh Lord that word was of that
[1:33:06] word was written of you Lord that a
[1:33:07] virgin shall conceive but then when it
[1:33:10] became flesh then it became a reality
[1:33:12] then it became father God it became
[1:33:15] manifested as your prophet said it
[1:33:17] became light and when something is
[1:33:19] manifested there's no you can't doubt it
[1:33:21] anymore we cannot doubt at Lord and we
[1:33:23] believe found that you've been made
[1:33:25] manifest for us in this last time you've
[1:33:27] made a way for us to escape the Great
[1:33:29] Tribulation Period Lawyer and how
[1:33:31] thankful we are O God that you would
[1:33:33] count us worthy father gone to escape it

[1:33:44] the Saints Lord and their attention and
[1:33:46] to to listen to the word father Lord and
[1:33:49] have enough hunger in their hearts to
[1:33:50] come and subject themselves Lord to the
[1:33:53] word father for Lord this isn't a flesh
[1:33:55] and blood affair Lord this is between
[1:33:57] life and
[1:33:58] father and we're not just talking about
[1:33:59] natural death or we're talking the real
[1:34:02] death that eternal separation from God

[1:34:07] see that second death Lord Oh God Lord
