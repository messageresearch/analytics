========================================

god bless you could be in the house of the lord this morning you come with an expecting heart i can't wait to hear what the lord has in store for us today so we've been in uh the book of hebrews and we're on chapter seven um let's just go to the lord in prayer and ask him to bless the study lord lord we're so grateful to be able to gather together today lord we just ask lord that you're just blessed brother reed as he's back there studying lord and lord open the scripture to us as we study these things out and just be with us the services today we ask in your name amen so hebrews chapter 7 is very meaty and if you remember back in in hebrews chapter 5 paul when he started talking about he he kind of touched on melchizedek just briefly and he said he said uh he he mentioned melchizedek and then he said he backed it looked like he backed off from it and he said um i've got a whole lot more to say about this but this is for somebody that's a full age uh that that to because it's a little bit deep and so uh we want to we want to we uh kind of started talking about it last sunday and and want to dive into it a little bit more because this gets into some some really meaty things where you came from and where you're going and and and and what we're going back into the into the mind of god and and so let's tackle this this morning with the help of the lord so it says in in in verse one for this melchizedek king of salem um and we know king of sale king of king of jerusalem priest of the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of salem which is king of peace and you can get all those things from the the name what what the word melchizedek the name melchizedek means you can pull that out of the hebrew and what what that's speaking of without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the son of god abideth a priest continually so he's he's stressing to he's trying to make the point to the hebrews that um this this man is is above above abraham somebody that could bless abraham somebody that abraham would want to give ties to um somebody that that levi who was in the loins of abraham who would out of levi would come the priesthood was was a so great that levi and the loins of abraham would pay ties to him so this man is greater than the priesthood that the aaronic priesthood now consider how great this man was under whom even the patriarch abraham gave the tenth of the spoils so last time i asked kind of ask the question why why did why did abraham pay ties to this man because abraham recognized that this man was was god that he was god come down to talk to him so you know and i kind of posed the question why do we pay tithes well we pay tithes not because we're we're trying to um try to fill the pockets of of some man or something because we recognize that we're we're getting something from something from god that god's speaking to us and we're trying to do just like abraham did we we want to do according to what the what the bible says because we recognize the presence of god in our midst that god is doing something we pay tithes not to a man but we're paying tithes really when you pay tithes you're paying ties to god now now if you go i just want to kind of set in your mind there's there's patterns in the scripture so when you look at the scripture look at these patterns and brother brown will lay out this pattern that abraham met melchizedek twice he met him in genesis 14 and then he met him in genesis 18 when he come with with the two angels come walking and he saw him in the plains and there he was in the tent and he looked up and there he was standing next to him and he he bowed us he bowed his head and and began to say if you go back and read and study genesis 18 all those things but i just want to lay out there's a beginning lay out that pattern there's a beginning and an end there's a pattern and every every story in the bible there's a pattern that um jesus at the river jordan and then jesus on the mount transfiguration david being anointed by samuel and david being anointed by the whole tribe of israel you're being born again and you come to a place of adoption there's a place where you there you meet melchizedek in a place where you come you've uh you've you've had communion with with melchizedek and been uh well we'll get we'll get to that in a second but listen in genesis 14 it says melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine this is in genesis 14 when abraham met him with that first time after the battle to rescue lot from cheddar leomer and all the all the kings and it says he was the priest of the most high god and he blessed him and said blessed be abraham of the most high god possessor of heaven and earth said see now the brother and and and paul would lay out this this pattern he said that god we know that this this man was greater than abraham because he was the one that was doing the blessing and blessed be the most high god which have to deliver thine enemies into thy hand and he gave him ties of all but let's uh so brother adam said and who is this melchizedek he said when abraham met him he was melchizedek he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the final end all the attributes of god so now he's going back into the mind of god that we're god thought of us and four knew us and and and he's thinking uh he he's taking us back every one of those attributes are gonna go through the same journey that abraham's going through every every son every attribute is gonna have to meet melchizedek every attribute is going to have to have communion with this man with god every son of the faith will absolutely do the same thing now isn't that true with all these all these stories you read about in the bible you see you as as christ is revealed to you it begins to open up that revealed to you the same journey that these people these the abraham and ruth and david and all these in the bible the same journey that they went on you're going on that same journey that they typed you're going through it in reality but let's let's kind of meditate on this now when when when abraham and genesis 14 met melchizedek melchizedek this god come down to him to commune with him served him bread and wine now let's think about that in genesis 14 it says he brought forth bread and wine you know all through the scripture what what what is communion when you when you're serving bread and wine when we come to the house of the lord today we're not looking to i don't think abraham sat down and was expecting maybe cornbread and mashed potatoes and green beans and that kind of thing but you know we're not coming for that that kind of carnal thing when we come to the house of the lord but what we're coming to is is to partake of the revelation of who god is of who jesus christ is and you see when when melchizedek came and sat down with abraham and offered him those things what what really that's speaking of is that he's sharing of himself he's revealing himself and you see maybe maybe we'll just say like taste and see that the lord is good you when you come to the house of the lord you want to taste and see taste a taste and how do you taste as you eat of the word eat of the body word of christ in revelation chapter 3 it says behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me so melchizedek's coming down he come down to sit with abraham and commune with him and sup with him and you see that's that's that promise all through the scripture is that god wants to sit down and reveal to you reveal to you himself to commune with you even in revelation chapter 10 go and take the little book that's that's what really what communion is is it go and take that book and eat it eat and what are you eating you're eating that manna where christ said i am that bread of life that came down from god out of heaven i am that manna that was typed in the wilderness when it fell and so we're eating the body word of christ where jesus said those those confusing what confused them at the time those words in john chapter six he said then jesus said unto them verily verily i send to you except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you except you eat except you take this bible and you eat it and the spirit come and quicken it you don't have any life in you who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat and deed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and i in him as the living father hath sent me and i live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me so now now think about that pattern that melchizedek come down to communion with abraham at the beginning of his journey sat down with him and he began to eat now isn't that the same thing that you and i do when you're when you're born again with that eternal life come down and filled you with his filled you with the holy ghost and you started to eat and you started to eat this word and the spirit began to quicken it and you began to move from that from there your starting point you you start at the starting point of your journey and you begin to eat and it build and build and build see that's that's what that's what melchizedek means to me is is that god coming down to have a personal relationship with you my brother ram said and who was this melchizedek he said notice now his attribute so now now we got to go we got to go back into the back part of god's mind into the thinking of his mind he said then the attribute was first god the thought the attribute itself all in one without being expressed then when he expressed secondarily he became then the word and then the word was made flesh and dwelt among us saint john the first chapter in the first verse notice this is in the beginning but before the eternal notice in the beginning was the word when the time began it was word but before it was word it was attribute a thought now now let's let's let's don't get tired so so quick now let's let's think about these things that even in your own even in your own natural ability you have a thought and then when you speak it then other people can understand what you're thinking about so god god had a he had thoughts about he was going to be a redeemer and a healer and a savior and he thought about those things but it had to be expressed so that's what that's what brother brown was expressing now that that god wanted to manifest the things that he thought about the attributes of himself so that they would come into being come into manifestation he said now we're getting where melchizedek is that's this mysterious person the word the logos that theophany in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and then the word became flesh and dwelt among us hold that there now notice his first being was spirit god supernatural all right the great eternal second he began to form himself towards flesh in a theophany it's called the word a body now see his first being was spirit god supernatural the great eternal so how are you going to understand that how are you going to understand what what brother branham explained as a diamond in one place or fountain in another place or a rainbow in another place with all these attributes a fountain with streams of love and righteousness and all of these things all these attributes that god desired to express how are you going to understand that but god manifests he come out with that logos he expressed himself in the logos the body the attribute of the fullness of the word and began to come down into sin because his ultimate goal was to put himself in flesh his ultimate goal to manifest himself in christ and then from there to manifest himself in a body of believers that he thought of before the foundation of the world this then is the state he was in that that state of the logos the theophany when he met abraham was called melchizedek he was in the form of theophany well now we'll get to that and prove it in a few minutes the lord willing he was the word so now that's what john is talking about john if you want to go back and study uh john honestly is as i think is one of my it's one of or my favorite book in the bible because it's that eagle book and john starks off he hits the ground running with the famous statement in the beginning was the word so that's what we're talking about in the beginning was the word the logos that god expressed himself in and the word was god was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the light was the light and the life was the light of men so what are we talking about we're talking about eternal life eternal life that god wanted to express to you and i to give to you and i and what's the point that paul is trying to make here in hebrews is that you're not sufficient in your own self you needed you needed eternal life you needed eternal life that this melchizedek had in him to express to you that god came down to to fulfill his his thought of you before the foundation of the world that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him none so let's start let's start looking at some pictures here now now think brother brown expressed that the father is that diamond the attribute the attributes the thoughts of god so so begin he began to start coming down and out of he he expressed himself out of the out of the out of all of those attributes that he wanted to express he expressed himself in the logos the theophany now i've got i've got this little graphic here of the like a a little orange man just to kind of show to illustrate the the supernatural element of this but what was this what's a theophany look like it looks like the person that they often come down and talk to abraham and it didn't look like some kind of glowing thing it was it looked like a man and brother brown said it's a it's got a higher thinking a higher a higher hearing a higher speaking all of those things but yet it's got five hit ten fingers and ten toes because it's a body and he would make that point over and over again that god is not just kind of like some spirit some floaty around but he's actually some he's he's a body that you can look at and understand and that's what this logos is it's something that you can relate to he's coming down so that you can understand him he wants to be understood and brother adam said in the pillar of fire he said and now the bible teaches us that the logos went out of god or i might say all of the god becoming his first body form when the logos went out of god let's look what it looked like no one has seen the father at any time nowhere never did and never willed you're never going to see the father but the only way you're going to see the father is as like jesus said if you've seen me you've seen the father because the word is the expression of the father and if the word is in you then you are the expression of the father you can that's what i i make the point if you want to see what who god is maybe maybe when you're listening to tape you're hearing god's voice maybe when you're hearing the preaching you're hearing god's voice because god is manifesting himself through his bride today that's what that's what the whole point of that sermon who is this melchizedek that that same god that manifested himself to abraham and came down in christ that same god is on the scene today at his bride no one has seen the father at any time nowhere no nowhere never did and never will but then the logos that went out of him become like a little halo of light let's see it playing yonder like a child before the doorstep of the father and now i can see him as he moves over here and he draws into his memory or his mind a picture of what the world should be you think about the logos playing like a little child how should i i i i don't know if you've had a chance to look at those uh pictures of the new telescope that they just launched the james webb telescope they can go can look way out into the galaxies and you think about the logos come playing like a little child on the doorstep of the father how shall i make the world how shall i make the solar system how shall i make the place where i'm going to come down and live and be manifested and he drew into his memory how in his mind because god never has a new thought never has a new thinking he knows the end from the beginning and the logos just drew in his mind this is how to do it and began to speak it he said there's not a star or nothing i hear him say let there be and an atom broke yonder and when it did the sun came into existence and began to whirl she burned for millions of years and millions and millions of years after a while i see a clinker fly off it what is it the first star that flew from the sun he watches it fall for a few million years and he stops it then another one flies off and he lets it fall a few million years and stops it what's he doing writing his first bible the zodiac so now the logos this great fountain brother brown explained and another see all these different ways that he's trying to express to us a diamond a fountain a rainbow all these things so we can kind of have some semblance of a picture in our mind of this this uh this office that you're you're never going to really understand with outside of the logos the logos this great fountain this great fountain of spirit which had no beginning or no end this great spirit began to form in the creation and the logos that went out from it was the son of god and it was the only visible form that the spirit had that was the only the only way that you're going to be able to know god is through the word and it was a theophany which means a body and the body was like a man so now let's let's examine now as we as god is condescending so we can understand who this man was that came to came to abraham and sat down with him and talked with him and began to have communion with him and share with him who he was and who his nature was and and all these things in a way that would make abraham recognize who that was and want to pay ties to him amen in john 1 18 it says no man has seen god in any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him so so out from the god just uh we use like poor eye he everything that the father is that he poured into the sun that the attribute of the fullness of god which john 1 1 says in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was with with god and the word was god but but keep coming on now because because in in this logos he's got all these attributes not just redeemer and healer and love and savior and all those things but he's got attributes of you and i that he wants to express so in genesis 1 26 it says and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth now how would how would you express this visually that god thought of everyone that was going to be expressed in his mind he had all of these attributes in him that were going to be expressed now the only way this is just me now the way that i want to express that this morning that is just put that put that uh put the statue of a perfect man on that because in every age he had a people that he was going to express in the the age of the ephesian church age and the a the smyrna church age he thought he knew of each one that was going to be expressed and they they were they had to come into being you see and we'll say another way to express is that god had like a book in his mind a book a a a book that he was going to express that unfold and you know that's the supernatural side but he actually put that book in writing here so that as you read this bible you're actually reading what he thought of before the foundation of the world and as the side effect of christ being revealed when christ is revealed it actually reveals you in his word because when christ is revealed it reveals you because you're part of him you're part of his word so as as as his word is revealed you see your part where you fit into the bible where you where you see the role that you have to play you preachers read ephesians 4 11 and they see their part believers read malachi 4 and they see their part that their hearts are going to be turned back you read the book of the in revelations where it talks about believers in laodicea and you see that you're part of that and as christ's word is revealed it reveals that you're part of him that's what genesis 1 26 27 is talking about in the believer's position in christ brother brown said when god made man he said let us make man in our own image let us give them make man in our image spirit man and give them dominion over the fishes of the sea and the cattles and so forth he said now back there before the foundation of the world god chose you in christ jesus to appear holy at the end time all the way from the foundation of the world that's what genesis 1 26 is speaking of that god before the foundation of the world that you were chosen in him that he thought of you that that he he had that part of his eternal life that part of his word reserved for you that when when in the day that you would be manifested you would pick up the bible or you would hear the preaching of the word and it would be quick in the life the life that he saw that you would receive before the foundation of the world what what what brother ram in hebrews chapter 4 he said was god a man certainly let us make man in our own image what was god a theophany a body and their man was made like that and put over the garden but there was no man to till the soil and the senses then he created man out of the dust of the earth and the animal life and that man till till the soil and the man fell by transgression correctly and god the theophany come down and was made flesh and dwelt among us to redeem the man now now let's not lose track of what we're talking about we're trying to we're trying to lay the foundation of who this is that came to talk to abraham who who is this who is this melchizedek who was that melchizedek that came and talked to him and questions and answers on hebrews number three brother ram said well what do we do well my dear sainted brother my dear sainted sister before the foundation of the world when god created you in his image or created the man in his image and created the woman in the image of the man for the glory of the man he made you a theophany just like himself when he said led us to the creatures that he had made you're you're part of christ in hebrews chapter five and six he said he had and so therefore melchizedek the great priest like a man he had no beginning and he has no end and when we through that theophany that we were made in the image of god before the world was ever made when that theophany has been made flesh and dwelt among us then through his death we ourselves receive his spirit and we have no end eternal life now see there there's that melchizedek without without father without mother without beginning of days or end of life and then when you've got that same eternal life imparted to you then you also will have no with no end eternal life look at this plan that god's trying to manifest as we got like two more minutes he said and john we come all the way from john chapter one no man hath seen god at any time in john 1 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god genesis 1 26 and god so let us make man in our image after our likeness and john 1 14 and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us that's what god is trying to do is come down to flesh to tabernacle himself and flesh so let's let's maybe change the the the the way this looks that we got a little a picture of jesus there because that's that that melchizedek he's working his way down to being tabernacled in the flesh of jesus which is what jesus when jesus prayed there john chapter 17 we've got this whole picture laid out in this prayer where he said these words and we'll end on this note he said these words spake jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour has come glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify thee as thou has given him power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him and this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou has sent and in verse four he said i have glorified thee on the earth i have finished the work which thou gavest me to do and now our father glorify thou me with thine own self which with the glory which i had with thee before the world was now see that's that contradicts if you go investigate oneness theology you'll find out that the oneness oneness do not believe that you can use the word son of god the term son of god before the incarnation of christ so the term son of god they don't believe that the son of god was manifest before jesus was incarnated he said i have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world those that were the attributes that god was longing to express i have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world thy they were and thou gavest to me and they have kept thy word god coming down from thought to attribute to flesh and the musicians go ahead and come forward and we'll end on that note in hebrews chapter 7 he said this melchizedek was not jesus for he was god and what made jesus and god different that jesus was the tabernacle that god dwelt in this man had no father no mother no beginning of days or ending of life but it was the self-same person melchizedek and jesus was one but jesus was the earthly body born and fashioned after sin
