[30:14] at before we read the scripture and
[30:17] before we get started now remember you
[30:19] and I are under an Elijah
[30:22] anointing all right an Elijah anointing
[30:25] now remember brother R gave us the
[30:28] characteristics of that Elijah anointing
[30:30] he'll be a man of the Wilderness he'll
[30:32] be this and that and the other all those
[30:34] different things hate women and and all
[30:36] that stuff so there's a characteristic
[30:38] now when we get started in the third
[30:40] pool you wonder well why is brother R
[30:41] talking about fishing and hooks and
[30:45] eyelets
[30:46] and well he's a prophet he's an Elijah
[30:49] Prophet he's a man of the woods he knew
[30:52] how to catch rainbow trout but remember
[30:55] that's all an allegory to put together
[30:57] to why we're here because of his
[30:59] ministry we are
[31:00] here and we must go through those same
[31:03] three polls in our journey not in the
[31:06] vision like he was in but in the message
[31:08] of the hour if Jesus had three poles
[31:10] Noah had three poles different ones had
[31:11] three poles then you and I have got
[31:13] three poles in our journey and we'll try
[31:15] to get into that if we don't then we'll
[31:17] get into it a little bit later but let's
[31:19] go to First
[31:22] Corinthians but as it is written I ha
[31:24] Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither ha
[31:26] entered into the heart of man
[31:28] the things which God hath prepared for
[31:30] them that love him he's already got this
[31:32] prepared if we Agape him not filo him I
[31:36] love what brother Aaron was speaking
[31:37] Wednesday night he's a lot of people's
[31:40] savior but he's a your
[31:43] lord I told him I'd been battling for
[31:45] about 3 weeks of what to preach in down
[31:48] at the Methodist Church in a couple of
[31:49] Sundays that's what I'm going to preach
[31:52] he gave me the sermon I pre I think God
[31:54] give me the sermon not him amen because
[31:58] many people have made him the Savior but
[32:01] have you made him your
[32:02] lord and claimed lordship that's why
[32:05] we're baptized he claims Us in the name
[32:07] of the Lord Jesus Christ all right sorry
[32:12] but God hath revealed them unto us by
[32:14] his spirit for the spirit searches all
[32:16] things ye the Deep things of God for
[32:19] what man knoweth the things of a man
[32:20] save the spirit of man which is in it
[32:22] even so the things of God knoweth no man
[32:26] but the spirit of God now we have
[32:28] received not the spirit of the world but
[32:32] the spirit which is of god that we might
[32:36] know or understand or
[32:39] see the things that are freely given to
[32:42] us of God you may be seated the Lord at
[32:44] his Blessing do you believe that freely
[32:47] given to us by God but we have to want
[32:50] it we have to make ourself as brother R
[32:53] said make yourself available for the
[32:55] word of God we must make ourself
[32:58] as we say Open the Eyes of our heart all
[33:00] those years and then we we talk about
[33:02] you know Open the Eyes of My Heart Open
[33:04] the Eyes of My Heart what is your heart
[33:06] your heart's your
[33:07] soul open that up don't open it up for
[33:10] the world open it up for God all right
[33:13] let God speak to you
[33:15] today now the Bible tells
[33:18] us I take this one thought when I talk
[33:22] about the three
[33:24] polls we know that was personal for
[33:26] brother brandham all right everybody
[33:28] with me we'll get into it in just a
[33:29] second that was personal for him but it
[33:32] wasn't so personal that he kept it to
[33:33] his own
[33:36] self he told it he told what it was and
[33:40] then even even the we'll read it here in
[33:42] a minute the angel says this is that
[33:45] third pole so he is identifying what
[33:48] brother Brown's going through okay it's
[33:51] not just brother I'm coming up with
[33:52] three PS the angel told him the angel
[33:56] was the one that was in there and he
[33:57] said it was the angel remember he said
[33:59] the the voice that spoke to me come
[34:01] around in front of me and he was had his
[34:03] arms folded and he had on a turban look
[34:06] middle
[34:09] easterner that's pretty vivid that's
[34:11] pretty vivid but he was there what was
[34:14] he doing he was guiding brother brandham
[34:17] through that
[34:18] Vision all right now many
[34:20] interpretations have come up through
[34:21] that Vision but I know I'm just going to
[34:23] tell you what brother Ram said and then
[34:24] we'll U uh you can make your own
[34:27] assumption but why did he tell it he
[34:29] told it so that you and I can see where
[34:32] he's coming
[34:34] from cuz if I can see where somebody's
[34:36] coming from I can try to understand him
[34:38] a lot
[34:39] more right so those three plls were
[34:42] given to me so that I can understand
[34:44] that I have three stages in my Christian
[34:46] Journey justification sanctification
[34:49] baptism of Holy Ghost and we know that
[34:51] there's layers there that he even said
[34:53] you'll be Fishers of Men cuz he was
[34:55] fishing and same way with all of us as
[34:57] Ministry today we are Fishers of Men
[34:59] we're out fishing
[35:01] for
[35:04] fish that will learn or that will take
[35:06] the bait now remember Divine Healing
[35:09] though was the bait on the hook not the
[35:13] hook all right the hook was get them
[35:15] into the message of the hour everybody
[35:18] with me but you got to give them you got
[35:20] to present you we'll read it he present
[35:23] he knew how to do it he was a fisherman
[35:24] he he was got a little bit caught up in
[35:26] his he really did because remember the
[35:29] angel of the Lord said this is your
[35:31] problem somebody me brother a was
[35:33] talking about or somebody was talking
[35:34] about there being stupid brother Brown
[35:36] called himself stupid in that dream he
[35:38] said God forgive your stupid servant
[35:41] remember when he got the line all
[35:42] tangled up well what was he trying to do
[35:44] he was trying to tell brother R said
[35:45] look you're a fisher of men this is what
[35:47] you got to do don't get tangled up in
[35:49] times like this that's what the angel of
[35:51] the Lord said don't get tangled up in
[35:53] times like these in other words what's
[35:55] he telling now that that dream was a
[35:56] long time for to seal
[35:58] open come on I'll read it to you in just
[36:01] a minute it was in the
[36:04] 50s okay so don't get your line Tangled
[36:07] Up In other words you got to straighten
[36:09] out everything because I'm going to
[36:11] bring when I bring you the seals that's
[36:13] when you going to really start catching
[36:15] those real big rainbow trout trophies
[36:19] you and I today are the recipient are
[36:21] you and I are trophies of brother
[36:23] brandom throwing the line out and
[36:25] catching you by the word of God God by
[36:29] the word of God not by Brother Randon by
[36:31] the word of
[36:32] God he was
[36:34] debate on the
[36:36] hook the hook is what you're
[36:39] getting which is Jesus Christ the same
[36:41] yesterday day and
[36:44] forever there's no way the prophet of
[36:46] God ever turned anybody to himself never
[36:48] did he do
[36:50] that second Corinthians your Epistles
[36:54] written in our hearts known and read of
[36:55] all men
[36:58] when I was looking through some of this
[36:59] yesterday or day before yesterday and
[37:02] you look at this and you if you've been
[37:05] in the message how many's been in the
[37:07] message 10 years or
[37:10] less wow so it's been over 10 years
[37:12] every well and 10 years Michael 10 years
[37:16] or
[37:16] less all right so we must be pretty
[37:19] seasoned veterans right okay and you've
[37:22] heard of the third poll or the three
[37:24] polls or this is happen and and people
[37:26] speak of the Third third
[37:28] pole but if you really studied it for
[37:31] yourself not just what somebody
[37:33] said you got to study it for
[37:36] yourself cuz you have that same journey
[37:38] to go through do you know you are
[37:39] Fishers of Men also even though you're
[37:40] not
[37:43] ministers because somebody will be
[37:45] attracted or distracted with who you are
[37:49] and what you are and either they'll take
[37:51] the Baer they want a lot of you sitting
[37:54] here where the recipients of of brother
[37:56] Dale work in General Motors I know a lot
[37:59] have passed away but when the church was
[38:01] in the 80s and the early '90s it was
[38:03] full of people that that brother that
[38:05] brother Dale had cast a line
[38:08] out all right down there in General
[38:11] Motors and we're recipients of
[38:13] that of that catching of the fish and
[38:16] then brother dick caught fish and then
[38:18] brother col uh brother colie still here
[38:21] brother Al different ones they caught
[38:23] fish cuz look at it now somebody caught
[38:26] your attention didn't they no I got it
[38:28] from the paper you didn't get it from no
[38:30] paper you don't get this message from a
[38:33] paper you get this message by a
[38:35] Vindicated prophet and you believing he
[38:38] was and believe what he
[38:41] said so you are Epistles written in our
[38:44] hearts known and read of all
[38:47] men not to bring anything to oursel now
[38:50] because we're nothing but when we get
[38:53] into the Millennium when we get into the
[38:54] future
[38:55] home we're going to be
[38:58] special we're going to be the ones
[39:00] that's
[39:01] overcome we're going to be the ones
[39:03] that's overcome the devil we're going to
[39:05] be ones us overcome
[39:07] death and people are going to look at us
[39:09] and go wow you get to live in the city
[39:13] yes we get to live in a city because
[39:14] what did we do down here we became
[39:17] listen to me we became the message of
[39:20] the hour for our
[39:22] day we became that we didn't just go
[39:26] through the motions it's written about
[39:28] all of us that's right he talks about
[39:31] the bride that's you he he's calling
[39:33] your
[39:34] name your name is called every service
[39:38] you ought to say that ain't nothing but
[39:39] the truth find
[39:43] something for as much as you are
[39:45] manifestly declared to be the Epistle of
[39:47] Christ so all right expressly manifest
[39:50] declared Epistle of Christ ministered by
[39:53] us now Paul was pretty specific
[39:57] got it from him or you didn't get it
[39:58] from nobody else all right I'm sorry I'm
[40:00] just telling this is Bible written not
[40:03] with ink but with the spirit of the
[40:04] Living God not in tables of stone but in
[40:06] fleshly tables of the heart we'll skip
[40:09] right there just a second because as we
[40:11] were talking the other day the great
[40:12] mystery is that you and I are standing
[40:15] here sitting here today walking through
[40:17] time here today Eternal
[40:21] beings if you're born again you're an
[40:23] eternal being doesn't matter what
[40:25] happens to you in the next 10 seconds 5
[40:27] Seconds hours two hours days you're
[40:30] Eternal beings by the new birth you're
[40:33] sitting here with a soul that is
[40:36] eternal that's a mystery that is the
[40:39] mystery what is the mystery Paul said
[40:42] the mystery is Christ in you the hope of
[40:45] glory now if Christ is in you that makes
[40:47] you bride it don't make you a church
[40:50] member it don't make you a foolish
[40:51] virgin right makes you bride it makes
[40:56] you that Genesis 126 person not not like
[40:59] it but part of it listen that was a
[41:03] literal part of God himself he's the
[41:05] only one that can subdivide and not get
[41:07] any weaker that's right cuz he's a
[41:11] Creator we were created in His image
[41:15] formed in His image there was no time
[41:17] that we didn't exist but we didn't know
[41:20] that we had to come down
[41:22] here and that Mind Of God come to us
[41:26] gave us New Birth and as Paul said now
[41:28] we have the mind of Christ sure we make
[41:31] mistakes sure we got all these Devils
[41:32] that we worry about and I keep right
[41:35] here every
[41:37] day but what are we when are we going to
[41:39] stand up and say I am amen that I
[41:44] am I am that I am I'm that
[41:49] person yeah but all the devil just
[41:51] jumped on your back now and said well
[41:53] you did this yesterday and the day
[41:54] before to
[41:55] day remember remember as brother Aaron
[41:58] always said when Satan's talking he's
[42:01] lying when he's opening his mouth when
[42:04] he's moving his lips he's lying okay he
[42:07] might tell part of the truth but he'll
[42:08] never tell the whole
[42:09] truth but you and I are be able to stand
[42:12] up though and stand up in front of the
[42:13] devil and say devil whatever you're
[42:15] saying that ain't
[42:16] true it may look
[42:19] bad but why are we looking I thought
[42:22] we're supposed to believe the things
[42:23] that we can't
[42:24] see that makes us a believer you don't
[42:27] have to believe that I'm going to be at
[42:29] church today you may have at 10:00 or
[42:32] 9:00 but I am here you are here yes and
[42:37] that's what God is in the word of God
[42:40] sure we have a journey we have the three
[42:43] plls we go through justifica listen Paul
[42:46] said I Die daily so we go through
[42:48] sanctification process every single day
[42:51] if you're a
[42:52] Christian I mean there's things you do
[42:54] that you say God I'm so sorry I did that
[42:56] now pray for me if you got all if you're
[42:58] all that perfect and you got it all
[42:59] worked out come up here and help us I'm
[43:02] not kidding
[43:04] you there's things we have to look
[43:08] at worry
[43:11] about every single day but that doesn't
[43:15] deter me from studying to try to get us
[43:17] in a
[43:23] Rapture so it's not the letter but the
[43:26] spirit for the letter kth but the spirit
[43:29] giveth life and where is that spirit
[43:32] it's inside of me and you that's sister
[43:35] cleta brought me a uh she was want to
[43:37] know where brother R said that that
[43:39] Jesus never uh his foot never touched
[43:42] the Earth until the Millennium well he
[43:43] doesn't really that's one of those
[43:44] quotes that he really don't say that but
[43:47] I did but I did find where brother Brown
[43:49] said that Jesus will not be on
[43:52] earth until the Millennium don't look
[43:55] for his body of Flesh listen don't even
[43:57] look for his body of Flesh when we take
[43:59] a
[44:00] rapture we meet him in the air thank god
[44:03] brother Brandon was scripturally correct
[44:05] when he was in that Sage field and he
[44:07] was praying and the Lord appeared to him
[44:09] what'd he say he was 78 feet off the
[44:12] ground that was very scriptural cuz if
[44:14] he'd have been standing on the ground
[44:15] walking to him that wouldn't have been
[44:17] scriptural he was up in the
[44:20] air but we're going to meet him in the
[44:22] air but listen he has endued us with
[44:24] power so much he's going to give us that
[44:27] Authority on Earth as he as he did
[44:32] Adam and listen you and I are not going
[44:35] to lose that
[44:36] Authority we're going to win we're going
[44:39] to take us back to
[44:41] [Applause]
[44:45] Eden listen if you're a Christian today
[44:47] this is off subject but there's an Eden
[44:50] somewhere in you
[44:53] somewhere there's a piece that passes
[44:55] all understanding can't you read
[44:58] scripture you say well I'm just so beat
[45:03] well pray to
[45:05] God that he give you some kind of Peace
[45:08] somewhere okay cuz you'll drive yourself
[45:14] crazy Lord whatever
[45:16] happens I know it's for my good CU you
[45:19] said you'd never put anything on us more
[45:20] than we can
[45:22] stand I depend on that because sometimes
[45:25] it piles up pretty high
[45:27] amen right just true it just piles
[45:31] up the reason I said her is her you know
[45:35] you did y'all see the um baptismal
[45:38] services that brother Joe pulled up from
[45:40] the
[45:40] 90s who walked in the water well Josh
[45:43] was one Timothy Dy was one and then the
[45:46] other one was Robbie and a couple other
[45:48] people and there was Robbie getting
[45:50] baptized well you know what that may not
[45:52] have worked back then for
[45:54] him but it will catch up with him
[45:58] somewhere and it will for the same for
[46:00] some of you that have children that have
[46:02] come through and went and baptized and
[46:04] and came to church but then when they
[46:06] got older they left and I am one of
[46:12] them but God calls you in his
[46:16] time he calls you in his time not your
[46:19] time not your mama's time not your
[46:21] daddy's time he calls him in your
[46:23] time you know why because you can only
[46:26] be ready for God God when you're ready
[46:28] for
[46:29] God you hear me you understand that you
[46:32] can only be ready for God when you're
[46:33] ready for God I got to where I didn't I
[46:35] hated what I was doing I hated my life I
[46:39] hated what was going on I hated it so
[46:41] much I said I don't want this no more
[46:43] amen you so that's too simple that's the
[46:45] way the gospel is it's so
[46:47] simple get sick and tired of being sick
[46:50] and
[46:52] tired present it to God he's right there
[46:56] amen he's not
[46:58] you you don't have to
[47:03] scream he answered and said unto them
[47:05] now this is Jesus
[47:07] talking to the disciples but he's
[47:10] talking to me and you all right with me
[47:13] because it is given unto
[47:16] you not somebody else it's given unto
[47:20] you to know no see understand now listen
[47:25] I'm going to interpolate just a second
[47:27] the mysteries of the Kingdom for your
[47:30] time because look it says but to them it
[47:32] is not
[47:34] given go listen visible
[47:38] Union 1965 brother Ram he said the word
[47:42] that fell in the day Pentecost will not
[47:44] work this day no
[47:47] sir that was for
[47:49] Pentecost this is for the bride going
[47:53] home of the Bride we got some something
[47:59] different I'm just reading you quote the
[48:02] Pentecostals represented that again
[48:05] wherein the bride age no more than the
[48:08] word of Noah would work in the day of
[48:10] Moses no more than Moses's law would
[48:12] have worked in the time of Paul he tried
[48:15] to tell them you are dead to that and
[48:17] you cannot have
[48:18] that so down to the church ages he's
[48:21] given it to each Church age by portion
[48:25] but you and I are to be the fullness of
[48:26] the godhead bottle in the end time so he
[48:28] gave us the full Revelation he gave us
[48:31] the as brother R said the Myster is now
[48:34] history 1 Corinthians 10:1 now all these
[48:37] things happen unto them for example
[48:40] talking about the Old Testament and they
[48:41] are written for our admonition upon whom
[48:43] the ends of the world are come you and I
[48:46] are standing here right here
[48:47] today if you see what's going on around
[48:49] a country and around the nation this is
[48:54] it the world's not going to stand this
[48:56] anymore
[49:01] so what's the great secret
[49:02] mystery
[49:05] you and that you can hold your head
[49:09] above what's going on in the
[49:12] world we fall every day but you know
[49:14] what brother R said look he said what is
[49:16] the true Mark of a true Christian you
[49:18] get
[49:20] up you get up and you continue again you
[49:24] get up and continue again I was I looked
[49:27] for that quote the other day I quoted it
[49:29] where that guy was getting ready to have
[49:30] a a meeting in a town and he's washing
[49:33] the windows and getting everything ready
[49:34] and the bully walks in and he says um
[49:37] what are you doing Mist said well I'm
[49:38] having a meeting here he said well you
[49:39] got to whip me first he said brother R
[49:41] said he climbed down climb down off off
[49:44] off of the ladder he said he pulled his
[49:46] jacket off and I don't think he even
[49:48] give that guy time enough to do anything
[49:50] he said by the time he had him down he
[49:51] was on the ground and he was saying I
[49:53] must fight that I may win I must fight
[49:56] that I may win and he beat that guy up
[49:58] and then the guy got saved that night or
[50:00] the next night got he may have took a
[50:02] day off but after he got wept but he got
[50:05] saved in the meeting
[50:07] so we got a fight to
[50:10] win now watch Christ Ministry of God
[50:12] reveal but when the current is Flowing
[50:15] freely the word of God it expresses
[50:18] itself The Works that I do shall be you
[50:20] be also and in the last days it shall
[50:23] come to pass behold I sent to you Elijah
[50:25] the prophet now here he's telling us
[50:28] what's what's coming and we know it's
[50:30] there but he's telling us what's coming
[50:32] we know he was it behold I send you
[50:34] Elijah the prophet and he shall turn the
[50:36] hearts of the children back to the faith
[50:38] of the fathers all right now that was
[50:40] remember there's two parts one part was
[50:43] what turning back to the faith of the
[50:45] fathers now
[50:48] watch and in
[50:52] there in there the second part the the
[50:55] pyramid that I told you you could read
[50:57] what was on the outside and he said all
[50:59] that on the outside I told him what it
[51:01] was he said but there was an Unwritten
[51:03] part on the inside that had to be
[51:05] interpreted by only by a prophet that's
[51:07] what he's talking about right there and
[51:09] in there there would be a Time come
[51:11] forth when he could express himself in
[51:14] fullness of his
[51:17] godhead deity through his church have
[51:22] the preeminence in this church oh my
[51:24] what the anointed man now the anoint OED
[51:27] people oh my what to bring back the
[51:30] anointed bride and bridegroom anointed
[51:32] by why accepting what Eve turned down
[51:35] and Adam coming back with the anointing
[51:38] of the word because he said my word is
[51:40] spirit Anointed with the word what Eve
[51:42] turned down he comes back and we accept
[51:45] all right John 15 ver4 says abide in me
[51:49] and I in you as the branch cannot bear
[51:51] fruit of itself I think somebody read
[51:53] that today except it abide in the vine
[51:56] no more nor can ye except you abide in
[51:58] me I am the vine you are the branches he
[52:01] that abideth in me and look and I in
[52:07] him flow
[52:09] through the same bringeth forth much
[52:11] fruit for without me you can do
[52:15] nothing I say Amen to all
[52:17] that now watch what brother Brown talks
[52:19] about he talks about the Book of
[52:22] Revelations so it's an uncovering
[52:24] revealing what was previous ly
[52:28] hid now the uncovering is not only the
[52:30] revelation of the person of Christ he
[52:32] talking about the Book of Revelation but
[52:34] it is the revelation of his future work
[52:36] in the oncoming seven Church ages now
[52:39] who encompasses seven Church ages why
[52:42] are they seven Church agents why are
[52:44] they seven Messengers because there's
[52:47] seven groups of people that's going to
[52:49] take it and live
[52:51] it so it's not just seven Church ages
[52:54] it's the people in the age right amen
[52:57] remember you say the whole city came out
[52:59] to see the parade well all the buildings
[53:01] didn't jump up to the to the sidewalk no

[53:20] you in the
[53:22] parade remember remember the
[53:24] dream he the were the bride was put into
[53:28] view might have been a few got out of
[53:31] Step but they got back in everybody with
[53:34] me so you were put on preview that was
[53:37] you when I look at this and I read this
[53:40] I I look at this and I say God you're
[53:42] talking to me you're not talking to
[53:43] people sitting in the in the in the room
[53:45] at that time you're talking to me I'm
[53:49] the one who the ends of the world come
[53:50] upon I'm the on who the Mysteries are to
[53:52] be revealed I'm the one to where we our
[53:54] heart is open to where we go back to the
[53:56] faith of the fathers and then we're able
[54:00] as he took the unwritten part you know
[54:02] what he did he took the unwritten part
[54:04] and made it
[54:06] written in 1100
[54:09] sermons he took it and made it written
[54:12] where you can read it and become
[54:14] it praise God for the print and press I
[54:17] know we're all digestal now and all that
[54:19] but thank God for those old
[54:22] books Hall remembering the Lord 1963
[54:26] listen if there's anything we're lacking
[54:28] let's do it if there's anything lacking
[54:31] with us let's get back to that let's
[54:34] remember what he
[54:36] required not what we think we ought to
[54:39] have but what he said we got to have we
[54:43] got to have it that way the way he said
[54:46] it so you can't come any other way
[54:48] remember there some people try to get in
[54:50] the back door they some people tried to
[54:52] get in through the window and they were
[54:54] tossed out of the party right let's
[54:57] don't be tossed out of the party you
[54:59] have an invitation today to put on that
[55:01] robe and walk straight into that door
[55:03] walk boldly to the FR to the throne of
[55:05] God Walk boldly and say God I need this
[55:08] this is what I need today this is what I
[55:11] need tomorrow you don't know what you
[55:13] need tomorrow yet but when you get to
[55:15] tomorrow you don't know what you
[55:18] need praise the Lord so it's not
[55:21] discernment now brother R we were
[55:22] talking the other day about the new
[55:23] ministry brother R thought it was a
[55:26] something new with prayer lines it
[55:29] wasn't that's why he kept 1958 5960 I
[55:33] read you all those a little bit later on
[55:36] I mean a little bit beforehand he was
[55:37] searching for a new ministry and he kept
[55:39] wanting to know you know was it
[55:40] something to do with the prayer line it
[55:42] was not it was the opening of the word
[55:44] the Seven Seals to be revealed to the
[55:47] people and you know what that's going to
[55:48] do that's going to change our body
[55:50] that's going to put us through that
[55:52] little tent that little room
[55:58] so all us deser discernment was to
[56:00] knowing the very secrets of the heart
[56:02] and we always put it to the prayer line
[56:03] but you remember brother brandham he's
[56:05] he's preaching along and he says hey
[56:07] don't think
[56:09] that hey don't think that I'm sure glad
[56:12] I don't have that
[56:14] gift hey don't think that when he when
[56:17] everything was coming at him while he
[56:18] was
[56:20] preaching several tapes he say you don't
[56:23] know what just passed before me
[56:25] something in a vision passed before him
[56:28] of either what was going on or what he
[56:29] had said or something going on in the
[56:32] congregation that's discernment but
[56:34] listen that discernment now was in one
[56:36] man as a
[56:38] gift one gift to one
[56:41] generation everybody with me now it's
[56:43] Discerning the thoughts and intents of
[56:45] the Heart by the word of
[56:47] God that's brother B was talking about
[56:50] listen we are judged every time we walk
[56:52] in this
[56:53] building you're judged listen you're
[56:56] even judged every time you read the
[57:00] Bible or a a message a message
[57:05] book our
[57:09] tape for the word of God is quick and
[57:11] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[57:13] sword piercing even to the dividing and
[57:15] Su of Soul and Spirit and of the joints
[57:17] and Marrow and discerner of the thoughts
[57:19] and intents of the heart there's no one
[57:21] that I can figure out in history or look
[57:23] back and see where that some man stood
[57:25] in the pull pit and say there's three of
[57:29] you you got this Center realm you got
[57:32] this next realm then you got this realm
[57:35] right Paul spoke of it see there's
[57:37] there's to me that's the letter of the
[57:39] mystery Paul said I pray that your whole
[57:43] body Soul and Spirit be preserved but I
[57:47] don't know that he ever recorded that he
[57:48] said now you got five senses in this
[57:50] realm you got five in this realm and
[57:52] only one in this
[57:54] one right and that's you
[57:57] and kids I'm
[57:58] sorry if you cut yourself this way in
[58:00] half there's not three
[58:07] rings for some of us if you cut US Open
[58:09] like a tree there'd be a lot of
[58:13] rings CU rings tell how old you are the
[58:16] rings of the tree well praise the Lord
[58:18] anyhow so it's not it you're intertwined
[58:22] as a as a human being when you're
[58:24] born you have a spirit spirit and a soul
[58:27] your mom and daddy gives you the body
[58:31] through what was set up in the garden
[58:34] through desire man man Mom and Daddy
[58:36] everybody with me but then God puts
[58:39] inside of you something for you to live
[58:41] by sorry I'm getting off subject a
[58:43] little bit but still there's an inside
[58:46] part of
[58:47] us that's the even when you listen the
[58:51] reason I did things wrong is because in
[58:55] my sa emanated
[59:00] evil and you say oh evil anything
[59:02] against God's word is
[59:04] evil okay I wasn't a murderer I did it
[59:07] with my
[59:09] mouth liar yeah all those different
[59:13] things but I had representation that one
[59:16] day that that thing was going to die
[59:18] inside of me because I I come to the
[59:21] place I didn't want that no
[59:24] more and so God I believe gave he
[59:27] birthed me into the body closed that up
[59:29] sealed it till the day of the
[59:31] Redemption but now remember the devil
[59:34] just took got out of that house and went
[59:35] into the next
[59:38] real well pray for
[59:40] me he got into that second ring and
[59:44] started playing around by my memory
[59:46] reason conscious affection
[59:48] imagination just like three PS you got
[59:51] three 's amen now listen you're not
[59:54] schizophrenic
[59:56] there's not three personalities I
[59:59] hope but there's three ways that God
[1:00:02] contacts
[1:00:04] you by your spirit and soul and then
[1:00:07] your body
[1:00:08] reacts
[1:00:10] okay just as brother brandom was come to
[1:00:13] the first pole he come to the second
[1:00:15] pole and he come to the third pole cuz I
[1:00:18] read to you here in just a minute so
[1:00:20] just keep that hold that in your mind
[1:00:22] and notice the next thing now watch here
[1:00:24] he took a bar and cut off
[1:00:26] the rock the inside of the rock that had
[1:00:28] nothing wrot on it now listen he's in a
[1:00:31] vision he's telling us that but remember
[1:00:34] there's another one coming up where he
[1:00:35] said there was an Unwritten
[1:00:38] part all right and at time I started to
[1:00:42] the west and I told him I said don't go
[1:00:43] west stay here and look on this till I
[1:00:45] return went West for the blast returned
[1:00:48] back to the east with the Holy Spirit
[1:00:50] interpreting this Unwritten word so now
[1:00:53] when they all looked in brother Aaron
[1:00:54] they looked in that in the dream they
[1:00:56] looked into that the box was tore off
[1:00:59] right everybody with me the the pyramid
[1:01:01] was tore off they knew what was around
[1:01:04] here because he said hey stay and look
[1:01:05] on this but there was a part of White
[1:01:08] Rock that there was nothing written on
[1:01:10] well now right now he's telling us that
[1:01:12] he's interpretating what was in that
[1:01:16] rock what a
[1:01:19] secret that's a secret that only he knew
[1:01:22] that he had the mind of God and he gave
[1:01:23] it to you and I
[1:01:26] right we not can only understand the
[1:01:27] unwritten part we are the unwritten
[1:01:31] part now for that isn't perfectly God
[1:01:34] Almighty I want you to know what it is
[1:01:36] what I'm trying to say this for friends
[1:01:38] is to show you we're at the end time so
[1:01:41] now let's look at the three pulls just
[1:01:43] for a
[1:01:44] minute now pull means now remember he
[1:01:47] didn't say
[1:01:49] push okay he said
[1:01:52] pull you can't be pushed into this we
[1:01:55] people have tried
[1:01:58] but that pull is the pull of the Holy
[1:02:01] Ghost on your life and my life that Holy
[1:02:05] Ghost is your LIF
[1:02:07] line he's going to talk about lines here
[1:02:09] fishing lines the Holy Ghost is your
[1:02:13] lifeline it's out
[1:02:16] there but it's not going to attach
[1:02:18] itself to you you got to come and bite
[1:02:23] it so a pull means a Force drawing
[1:02:27] someone or something in a particular
[1:02:30] direction remember it's not for anybody
[1:02:32] else it's for us in a particular
[1:02:34] direction or course of action so what's
[1:02:37] God doing through your life he's pulling
[1:02:40] you through each stage of your
[1:02:42] life and you must know that we get stuck
[1:02:45] in Seasons we get stuck in times that's
[1:02:49] okay as I said
[1:02:51] before don't lay down get back up take
[1:02:54] off amen
[1:02:56] amen they God I'm
[1:03:00] sorry so now here's the dream this is
[1:03:02] the 1956 is when he had this dream or
[1:03:05] Vision all right everybody with me stay
[1:03:07] with me y'all doing pretty
[1:03:10] good and at that time and at that the
[1:03:13] angel of the Lord taken me out then he
[1:03:15] taken me to a real bright stream of
[1:03:17] water it was the most beautiful blue
[1:03:20] water now what is
[1:03:21] water water is
[1:03:23] people water is people
[1:03:26] all right it was the most beautiful blue
[1:03:29] water and great fish were swimming
[1:03:31] around in it in one interpretation not
[1:03:33] in one interpretation but in one time he
[1:03:35] tells it again it was big large rainbow
[1:03:37] trout
[1:03:39] okay and you know he you know brother R
[1:03:42] held the world record for several years
[1:03:44] for the largest rainbow trout ever
[1:03:45] caught on whatever line he was catching
[1:03:47] it on it's in the den now but I mean
[1:03:49] somebody's beat that since then but
[1:03:50] during the time right here it'll I don't
[1:03:53] think this one but the next one he tells
[1:03:54] them he said well I've got one hanging
[1:03:56] on the wall That's world
[1:03:58] record I believe he caught world record
[1:04:00] rainbow
[1:04:02] trout right here and right
[1:04:07] there he was taking me to a real bright
[1:04:09] stream all right he said I will make you
[1:04:12] a
[1:04:13] Fisher now look who is he he is the
[1:04:16] Angel of the Lord what he said now watch
[1:04:18] hold on the angel of the Lord taken me
[1:04:20] out then all right so now cast your lure
[1:04:23] into the water and when you do pull it
[1:04:27] slow first
[1:04:28] time the next time just give it a little
[1:04:31] jerk not too hard and the next time set
[1:04:35] your hook for the catch first time
[1:04:39] second time third time
[1:04:42] right and I started to throw my line in
[1:04:45] the
[1:04:46] water I pulled and everybody began
[1:04:49] rejoicing and saying that's wonderful
[1:04:50] that's wonderful I got all excited
[1:04:53] somewhere in another version of this
[1:04:55] brother r says he saw and discerned that
[1:04:57] it was preachers and he said that's when
[1:04:59] I get in trouble when I get around a lot
[1:05:00] of preachers all right that's what he
[1:05:01] said amen so anyway that's wonderful
[1:05:04] that's wonderful I got all excited and
[1:05:07] jerked it hard on the next one out I
[1:05:09] pulled the fish and all out of the water
[1:05:12] and what it was it was a little bitty
[1:05:14] fish and it was about the size of the
[1:05:16] lure and I got my line all tangled up
[1:05:19] and I was straightening out my line and
[1:05:21] the man which was talking behind me
[1:05:23] walked around in front of me dressed in
[1:05:25] Palestinian clothes and a turban on his
[1:05:27] head he had a white robe he said brother
[1:05:29] brandom that's
[1:05:30] it I said I know I don't do
[1:05:37] right a prophet admitting he didn't do
[1:05:41] right so now stop right here and I'll
[1:05:44] explain them the first
[1:05:46] pull right second pull third pole the
[1:05:51] the angel is fixing to admonish him for
[1:05:55] trying to to explain
[1:05:57] it got his line all tangled up why he
[1:06:00] kept trying to explain it it caused
[1:06:01] impersonation it called all this let's
[1:06:03] let's just keep
[1:06:04] going don't I I jerked it when I ought
[1:06:08] not to he said don't get your line
[1:06:11] tangled up in these kind of
[1:06:14] times and I said well I'm running it as
[1:06:16] straight as I can I'll be very careful
[1:06:20] he said now the first time I spoke with
[1:06:22] you he knew who he was talking to it
[1:06:24] wasn't an unfamiliar voice
[1:06:26] that's right you put your hands on the
[1:06:28] people and told them what was wrong with
[1:06:30] them now for those of you that are new
[1:06:31] in the message or have been here not too
[1:06:34] long he used to take them by the hand
[1:06:37] he'd hold their hand and they would turn
[1:06:39] different colors there would be bumps on
[1:06:41] it I don't know how he deciphered all
[1:06:43] that but I know it was God anyway
[1:06:45] because the only thing he would say was
[1:06:47] he'd said well you got this and this and
[1:06:48] then he he'd grab or hold them again or
[1:06:50] still hold on to them he says see
[1:06:51] they're gone you're
[1:06:53] healed that was a simple form
[1:06:57] pretty simple to grab somebody by the
[1:06:58] hand and you look in yourself me you're
[1:07:00] looking at the hand and his hand turns
[1:07:02] all these different colors cuz remember
[1:07:04] he gave Moses the same sign he said put
[1:07:07] your hand in your bosom pulled it out it
[1:07:09] was leprosy he said put it back put it
[1:07:11] back in brought it out and it wasn't cuz
[1:07:13] the angel tells him said I've give Moses
[1:07:15] three signs I'll give you three signs
[1:07:17] all right but now remember your sign and
[1:07:20] my sign is didn't come from
[1:07:24] Moses it came came from a end time
[1:07:26] Prophet an Elijah that was a Wilderness
[1:07:29] man and and thank God that he had a
[1:07:34] Wilderness mind and he can understand
[1:07:36] this this ain't the first time he'd been
[1:07:39] fishing
[1:07:42] okay and told him what was wrong with
[1:07:44] him and the second
[1:07:45] pull while when you did you would know
[1:07:49] the secrets of their hearts all right
[1:07:50] that was when he wouldn't take them by
[1:07:51] the hand he'd look right at
[1:07:53] them and one of the he said ma'am he
[1:07:56] said I'm not looking at you he said I'm
[1:07:58] looking at your past a little screen
[1:08:01] would open up somewhere and he just sat
[1:08:03] there and watched the television of
[1:08:06] their
[1:08:07] life so it's all recorded but remember
[1:08:09] what he said he said but if you put it
[1:08:10] under the
[1:08:12] blood I can't see it God can't see
[1:08:18] it problem was is a lot of people didn't
[1:08:20] know how to put it under the
[1:08:22] blood we
[1:08:24] do and the the second pull while when
[1:08:26] you did you would know the secrets of
[1:08:28] their heart and I made you a sear before
[1:08:30] the people but you was always trying to
[1:08:33] explain it you ought to have done that
[1:08:36] and he said you made a public showing of
[1:08:39] it all right this is where he got his
[1:08:40] line tangled
[1:08:42] up I said oh I'm very sorry then he
[1:08:45] taken me from there and I seen a great
[1:08:47] huge tent and I took him from
[1:08:50] fishing to a
[1:08:52] tent still Wilderness if you're a
[1:08:54] wilderness guy you can live in a tent
[1:08:57] everybody with me all
[1:08:59] right it was a
[1:09:02] cathedral it was a
[1:09:05] tent and he taken me from there and I
[1:09:07] seen a great huge tent never seen such a
[1:09:09] tent and it was packed in lined
[1:09:11] everywhere with people and I walked out
[1:09:13] to the looked like I was standing above
[1:09:15] the people looking down where I had just
[1:09:18] made an alter call and hundreds and
[1:09:20] hundreds of people were weeping and
[1:09:22] rejoicing after they had accepted the
[1:09:24] Lord Jesus's the
[1:09:26] Savior and I looked and then heard a man
[1:09:28] get up and say call the prayer
[1:09:31] line and the people began to line up
[1:09:33] over on this side the left from where I
[1:09:36] was looking down towards the platform
[1:09:38] and they lined all the way up and down
[1:09:40] the street for a prayer line I noticed
[1:09:43] to my left which wouldn't have been
[1:09:44] would have been to my right if he was on
[1:09:46] the platform a little wooden building
[1:09:49] and I seen that the light that all they
[1:09:51] have the picture of it of you know
[1:09:54] that's always in the ings I've seen that
[1:09:56] light leave me and go to that building
[1:10:00] now what is the
[1:10:04] light what's the light the angel of the
[1:10:09] Lord the angel of the Lord all right so
[1:10:11] he's talking about the angel of the
[1:10:16] Lord I seen that light leave me and go
[1:10:19] to that
[1:10:21] building and go in that building
[1:10:27] now remember this is all
[1:10:31] allegory right this is all an example
[1:10:35] this is all something that we can see by
[1:10:37] spiritual eye not a white tent setting
[1:10:40] out somewhere in Jeffersonville
[1:10:42] everywhere they think they going to put
[1:10:45] it sorry listen if this over here was an
[1:10:49] allegory the fishing and the catching
[1:10:51] and making you Fishers and doing all
[1:10:53] this and explaining you can't make this
[1:10:54] over here
[1:10:57] natural people try to make it
[1:11:01] natural there's only one tent God's
[1:11:04] worried
[1:11:05] about that's
[1:11:06] yours the tent you walk in every day is
[1:11:10] the tent that God's talking about
[1:11:12] remember I just read you not in fleshly
[1:11:14] tables but in the secret in your heart
[1:11:17] or fleshly tables of your heart that's
[1:11:19] where it's
[1:11:20] written
[1:11:22] right and I seen that light
[1:11:27] they have the picture of it now remember
[1:11:28] that's the angel of the
[1:11:31] Lord I seen that light leave me and go
[1:11:33] to that building and go in that building
[1:11:37] and a voice said to me I'll meet you in
[1:11:41] there that'll be the third
[1:11:45] pull all right I'll meet you in there
[1:11:48] that'll be the third pole all right is
[1:11:50] everybody with me I'm G slow down just
[1:11:52] for a second so you can get this

[1:12:02] question he said well it won't be a
[1:12:04] public show like the
[1:12:09] others I'm telling you that's what the
[1:12:11] angel said it won't be a public show by

[1:12:28] was listen if he was fishing for men
[1:12:30] here he's still trying to get me in here
[1:12:33] but what he's done is he's took somebody
[1:12:36] from baby
[1:12:39] form to
[1:12:41] maturity knowing that that same Angel of
[1:12:44] the Lord is the same one that bir you in
[1:12:47] your
[1:12:48] temple bir you in your who came to you

[1:13:17] fine you ever seen that movie Left
[1:13:23] Behind if it's something physical then
[1:13:26] the dream

[1:13:30] spiritual start it's got to be spiritual
[1:13:33] end right if you don't then you've
[1:13:35] changed everything brother Adam every
[1:13:37] pattern he has told us when if it was a
[1:13:41] spiritual dream then it went all the way
[1:13:42] through as a spiritual dream or
[1:13:45] spiritual happening so it won't be a
[1:13:47] public show like the others and I was
[1:13:49] going to insert
[1:13:51] here where brother R comes up on the
[1:13:53] questions and answers on the seals and

[1:14:06] trouble but he's telling them the angel
[1:14:09] of Lord's telling them say look you're
[1:14:11] not going to speak before 25,000 people
[1:14:14] and they all get healed

[1:14:21] token message with 30 something people
[1:14:22] in a trailer

[1:14:29] others the end of the time of the end
[1:14:32] sir now this is right before the seals
[1:14:34] this is this is right after this
[1:14:37] happened right or right before this
[1:14:40] happened no right after this
[1:14:43] happened is that is this the
[1:14:48] mystery the whole message of sign of the
[1:14:51] end sir was a question asking you and
[1:14:55] and himself what was going on is this
[1:14:58] the end of the end of it sir sir is this
[1:15:01] the end time is this the mystery of the
[1:15:05] Thunders that will bring back The
[1:15:07] Headstone you know the pyramid never was
[1:15:10] capped The Headstone is yet to come now
[1:15:14] this is
[1:15:16] 1962 preached us back to the faith of
[1:15:18] the
[1:15:20] fathers what is The Headstone the
[1:15:23] seals the opening the seals the power
[1:15:25] back to the church the ministry of Jesus
[1:15:28] Christ the son of
[1:15:30] man the pyramid never was cap The
[1:15:33] Headstone is yet to come it's been
[1:15:35] rejected could it be brothers sisters oh
[1:15:37] is this that third pull that he told me
[1:15:39] 3 or four years ago the first pull you
[1:15:42] remember what happened I tried to
[1:15:44] explain it he said don't do
[1:15:47] that the second pull he said don't try
[1:15:51] and I pulled anyway you remember
[1:15:54] congregation says yes
[1:15:55] all of you remember it's on tape and
[1:15:57] everything and then he said now there's
[1:15:59] a third pull
[1:16:01] coming now remember he didn't say
[1:16:04] anything about
[1:16:06] tent
[1:16:08] nothing now there's a third pull coming
[1:16:10] but don't try to explain
[1:16:13] it you see how I approach this tonight I
[1:16:17] don't know remember brother brandham on
[1:16:20] the first seal he said I didn't know
[1:16:21] nothing
[1:16:25] it was way past my thinking I was
[1:16:27] getting my old notes out I was going to
[1:16:29] preach like I preached it in 1957 or 58
[1:16:32] preach them all in one
[1:16:34] night you see how I approached it this
[1:16:36] this tonight I don't know but I feel
[1:16:39] Duty bound to my church to say something
[1:16:42] you draw your own conclusion right now
[1:16:45] will this be the mystery that would open
[1:16:46] up that would bring Christ bring a power
[1:16:49] to the church
[1:16:50] see I believe in Repentance being
[1:16:53] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ we
[1:16:55] believe in receiving the Holy Ghost we
[1:16:57] have signs wonders Miracles speaking in
[1:16:58] tongues and all the things the early
[1:17:00] church had what was that the faith of
[1:17:02] the
[1:17:04] fathers we have that he
[1:17:07] said and frankly there's been more done
[1:17:10] right here than is wrote In the book of
[1:17:12] Acts and this one little group of people
[1:17:14] this little bitty Ministry of ours here
[1:17:16] what about the world over more than
[1:17:18] wrote In the book of Acts same kind the
[1:17:21] raising of the Dead remember there was
[1:17:22] only about three people raised of the
[1:17:24] Dead by Jesus and we have on record
[1:17:26] doctor's record
[1:17:28] five works should I do more than that
[1:17:31] shall you
[1:17:32] do I know the King James virgin says
[1:17:34] greater but you couldn't do Greater
[1:17:35] Works more of it he was in one person
[1:17:39] then he's in the whole church now right
[1:17:42] More Than This shall you do for I go un
[1:17:43] my father if this is the third poll then
[1:17:46] there is a great ministry lying
[1:17:50] ahead I can't say I don't know
[1:17:56] if he's lying he's not a
[1:17:59] prophet cuz remember when he went into
[1:18:01] that constellation of angels they told
[1:18:04] him to go back to Jeffersonville he did
[1:18:05] not get the revelation of the seals out
[1:18:07] in Tucson
[1:18:09] Arizona the angel said go back to
[1:18:11] Jeffersonville I'll meet you
[1:18:15] there
[1:18:16] watch third pull let's stop on that a
[1:18:19] minute and
[1:18:21] division now watch he switches
[1:18:25] from the fish
[1:18:27] Vision with me good y'all perked up on
[1:18:30] your seat maybe you'll we'll do this
[1:18:32] next Sunday no suay
[1:18:36] after well it is a mystery but it's a
[1:18:39] mystery we need to
[1:18:41] understand when somebody says third pull
[1:18:43] people then and and that is not true to
[1:18:46] the point to say we're just all third
[1:18:47] pull people there's First full there's
[1:18:50] people here that's just in justification
[1:18:52] that's baby Christians there's
[1:18:53] sanctification there's different on but
[1:18:56] we are to be the third pole
[1:18:58] manifestation of what he's talking about
[1:19:01] because at the end when they went
[1:19:03] through that little room they had
[1:19:04] healing they come in
[1:19:10] wounded they come in wounded and they
[1:19:13] left healed boy what a body
[1:19:16] change watch third pole let's stop on
[1:19:19] that a minute in the
[1:19:20] vision the first flight was a little
[1:19:22] messenger version now he's went to this
[1:19:24] vision
[1:19:25] Vision everybody with me read that I
[1:19:29] didn't bring it but this Vision was he
[1:19:31] looked and saw a constellation of little
[1:19:35] birds then the next one that come was
[1:19:38] bigger then the third was
[1:19:44] angels that was when that was the little
[1:19:46] messenger birds that was when we first
[1:19:48] started it growed from just taking a
[1:19:50] person by the hand am and you remember
[1:19:53] what he told me if you'll be sincere
[1:19:55] it'll come to pass that you know the
[1:19:57] very secret of the heart how many
[1:19:59] remembers that announced from here and
[1:20:01] Across the Nation congregation says amen
[1:20:02] and it did happen congregation says amen
[1:20:05] exactly then he said Don't Fear I'll be
[1:20:07] with you see and it shall go on now the
[1:20:10] first pull was little be
[1:20:13] Birds they went on to meet the time all
[1:20:16] right meet the
[1:20:18] time meet the coming of the Lord the
[1:20:20] first
[1:20:21] message the second time the secrets of
[1:20:24] the heart from taking a person by the
[1:20:26] hand and just standing there and saying
[1:20:28] what they had the next time it revealed
[1:20:30] their sins and told them what to do now
[1:20:31] what does the word do the word does that
[1:20:34] all right brother bam had come to a
[1:20:36] place in his ministry that he was coming
[1:20:37] to the full manifest manifestation of
[1:20:39] the word of
[1:20:41] God congregation says amen then that
[1:20:44] come to pass
[1:20:47] perfectly I want to ask these people
[1:20:49] that that's got all this garbage going
[1:20:50] on about brother BR he's so specific
[1:20:52] they ain't nobody can make this up
[1:20:57] and keep it right and keep it straight
[1:20:59] and keep it
[1:21:00] scriptural I know we don't know none of
[1:21:02] us but if anybody does come Among Us or
[1:21:04] anything you tell them come talk to me
[1:21:08] come talk to me about this we'll talk
[1:21:10] about
[1:21:11] this because brother Ron was a human no
[1:21:14] doubt but he brought a perfect word of
[1:21:17] God and he was very
[1:21:21] scriptural and you are witnesses and so
[1:21:23] is the world so is the church when I
[1:21:25] said I saw an angel and it was an
[1:21:26] emerald fire burning people laughed said
[1:21:29] Billy Get Next To Yourself the magic
[1:21:31] scientific eye of the camera took it
[1:21:33] downstairs as a picture over his head it
[1:21:36] wasn't lying I was telling the truth God
[1:21:38] Vindicated I said Darkness overshadows
[1:21:40] death then it's white remember the
[1:21:42] picture he took of somebody took a
[1:21:43] picture of the woman he announced that
[1:21:45] she was dying of cancer and there was
[1:21:47] all you could see was a her body from
[1:21:49] here down and it was black from here up
[1:21:51] then he pronounced her healed and the
[1:21:53] person took another picture and it was
[1:21:55] totally
[1:21:56] gone I said Darkness overshadows it's
[1:21:59] death black and this is white one is
[1:22:01] life the other one's death and there it
[1:22:03] is on the picture back there as George J
[1:22:05] Lacy said the mechanical eye of this
[1:22:07] camera won't take psychology are you
[1:22:09] following me congregation said amen all
[1:22:11] right now watch we'll be done right
[1:22:13] here notice the first little flight
[1:22:17] hand all right everybody with me first
[1:22:20] little flight hand the second was
[1:22:23] greater White fighter
[1:22:26] doves Holy Spirit revealing the secrets
[1:22:29] of the heart and the third flight was
[1:22:31] Angels not Birds angels and that's the
[1:22:35] end time that's all of it will this be
[1:22:38] the time brother is this the time now he
[1:22:42] said listen don't interpret it don't
[1:22:45] misinterpret
[1:22:46] this he's talking about the church and
[1:22:48] knowing the scientific eye of the camera
[1:22:49] and all that stuff and I watch what did
[1:22:52] John do John was the first one he said
[1:22:54] behold Lamb of God that takes away the
[1:22:56] sin of the world that's him is the hour
[1:22:59] has it arrived my brethren I don't say
[1:23:01] it has I don't know but I'm asking
[1:23:04] you I want you to think or will this be
[1:23:08] the time when it will be again Behold
[1:23:11] the Lamb of God or the time of Malachi 4
[1:23:14] to return the hearts of the children
[1:23:16] back to the Faith of Our Fathers will it
[1:23:19] be such a blast that will do such Mighty
[1:23:21] things until it will set the church
[1:23:23] that's been slopping or sloping slopping
[1:23:28] and cannot understand the mysteries of
[1:23:30] God and so forth when they see that
[1:23:32] Mighty blast sweep forth will it turn
[1:23:35] their hearts back to the father as the
[1:23:36] Bible said it would or was this the
[1:23:38] message already passed that should have
[1:23:41] done
[1:23:43] it it was a message in the past that
[1:23:45] already took us back to the faith of the
[1:23:47] fathers everybody with me on that all
[1:23:51] right KN once at the end time now the
[1:23:54] very day when this messenger not when he
[1:23:57] starts on not in the
[1:23:58] 47 but when he begins to declare his
[1:24:02] message all right his
[1:24:05] message the first pull healing the
[1:24:08] second pull prophesying third pull the
[1:24:12] opening of the word the Mysteries reveal
[1:24:14] now it's 1965 he's only a few months
[1:24:17] before he's taken off the scene he's
[1:24:19] finally honing it down to where he knows
[1:24:21] where it's at he knows what's going on
[1:24:23] and he knows what he's got to do I just
[1:24:26] believe
[1:24:27] that there's no more Mighty order to
[1:24:30] reveal the word than a
[1:24:31] prophet and the third poll was the
[1:24:34] opening of them Seven Seals to reveal
[1:24:37] the hidden truth that's been sealed in
[1:24:40] the
[1:24:41] word so was in prison the second pull
[1:24:44] was discer of the spirits to prophecy
[1:24:46] first was The Healing The Sick second
[1:24:49] was the prophecy that went forth and
[1:24:50] know the secrets of the thoughts when
[1:24:52] the word itself was made manifest which
[1:24:54] that's great but remember the seventh is
[1:24:57] the Finish could this be the Finish
[1:24:59] finish pull it's all over could it be
[1:25:02] think of it now where we at seven is
[1:25:04] always to finish three plls Jesus's
[1:25:08] Ministry consisted of three plls did you
[1:25:09] know that now remember Jesus's Ministry

[1:25:51] seven days that nothing happened his
[1:25:53] testimony preached to the doomed
[1:25:58] Amen in the day of Sodom they had three
[1:26:02] polls we keep talking here just a second

[1:26:26] clock now if you're spiritual you watch
[1:26:28] spiritual things it's on the dot 2:00

[1:27:02] going to happen the next
[1:27:04] day

[1:28:13] not here just pray for the ones that's
[1:28:16] out in the
[1:28:18] world because me and sister C was
[1:28:20] talking a few minutes ago it can't go
[1:28:22] much longer
[1:28:27] he just can't look at the world they're
[1:28:30] even now talking about every going to
[1:28:33] the Bitcoin thing and going to the
[1:28:35] whatever that other um cryptocurrency
[1:28:37] and all that
[1:28:39] stuff when the rich get richer the poor
[1:28:43] get
[1:28:45] poor but you should never look at the
[1:28:48] news and
[1:28:52] worry you should never look at the news
[1:28:54] come on brother um Lise you should never
[1:28:58] look at that and
[1:29:01] worry about what's going to happen next
[1:29:03] we know for a fact the United States is
[1:29:06] going to have to be so powerful that it
[1:29:09] speaks for the mother Church everybody
[1:29:12] with me that was told thus sayith the
[1:29:15] Lord by brother
[1:29:16] brandham and we're in Revelations 13 the
[1:29:20] image to the Beast that has to have
[1:29:22] power to speak for the Beast well who in
[1:29:24] the world standing there now that guy's
[1:29:26] got more power than anybody's ever
[1:29:29] had and that's all
[1:29:31] right would you remember
[1:29:34] what president- elect Trump
[1:29:37] said and it's it's on YouTube you can
[1:29:40] pull it up he said if you Christians
[1:29:43] will vote for
[1:29:44] me he said it'll be the last time you
[1:29:47] ever
[1:29:50] vote I say that's absolutely the truth
[1:29:53] but he wasn't talking to them he's
[1:29:55] talking to me cuz that's only 4 years
[1:29:59] we're going to get out of here I believe
[1:30:00] before 4 years so we won't ever have to
[1:30:02] vote for nobody else we better vote for
[1:30:05] Jesus Christ and forget the rest but the
[1:30:08] world's going to do what it's going to
[1:30:09] do there's going to be a boycott there's
[1:30:12] going to be different things happening
[1:30:13] we already know
[1:30:14] that how it happened we really didn't
[1:30:16] know but now we did since the last
[1:30:18] Trump's here so we're
[1:30:21] done but God bless you we love you with

[1:30:37] made known and brother randam I believe
[1:30:39] told us one time he said when the door
[1:30:40] of the Gentile Church closes he said God

[1:32:10] Elders all the all the people that have
[1:32:11] anything to do in the church I really
[1:32:13] appreciate all of you joining together
[1:32:16] and
[1:32:17] uh and giving us
[1:32:20] a a Zeal to do something man without a
[1:32:24] have you ever just sat down somewhere
[1:32:25] and said I wonder what I'm doing
[1:32:28] here well you better know what you're
[1:32:30] doing here
[1:32:33] now all right go ahead praise the Lord I
[1:32:38] guess we'll just use this microphone
[1:32:41] here um uh I know that our trip for to
[1:32:45] Honduras with brother Wade was back in
[1:32:47] December so I know that we're a little
[1:32:49] bit late on the report but we we've just
[1:32:51] been in in and out and just so much
[1:32:54] going on in the last three months so so
[1:32:57] we haven't been able to give the report
[1:33:00] and Christine she may say a little
[1:33:01] something but she was the one who
[1:33:03] prepared these pictures remember she is
[1:33:05] my uh secretary and when brother Wade
[1:33:08] was there she was her her secretary as
[1:33:11] well his secretary she's the one who
[1:33:13] takes the pictures because I just can't
[1:33:15] go around taking pictures when I'm
[1:33:16] talking to the brothers and things like
[1:33:18] that and it's and he's interpreting for
[1:33:20] me so that takes up a lot of his time
[1:33:22] too I got to be in with the ministers
[1:33:24] and things and so she's she's reporting
[1:33:26] all these things so that's why I really
[1:33:28] need her there amen she's a huge huge
[1:33:32] asset because she's the one who comes
[1:33:34] with with these reports and then sends
[1:33:36] them back to you all so that you all can
[1:33:38] see them you know as as quick as
[1:33:41] possible but anyways uh I just want to
[1:33:43] say once again and I know I've said this
[1:33:45] I said this last time I really really
[1:33:48] really I I believe that this
[1:33:50] trip um two reasons why we took this
[1:33:53] trip
[1:33:54] one of them was because this this was
[1:33:57] one of the last few things that brother
[1:33:59] Dale did before he passed away this
[1:34:02] church that we're about to show it was
[1:34:04] one of the last things that he said
[1:34:06] let's just help that church you know
[1:34:07] he'd come up here I'd give a report or
[1:34:10] something and I'd give a need and he'd
[1:34:12] just come up here and he'd say let's
[1:34:14] just go ahead and just give that help
[1:34:15] that chur and he' just just whatever
[1:34:17] this was one of the the last one amen
[1:34:20] and so the brother the brother brother
[1:34:22] uh Robert which is brother brother Eric
[1:34:24] Gallo's uh uh
[1:34:26] father-in-law he um he asked if brother
[1:34:29] Dale could be there during this
[1:34:31] ministers meeting that he was going to
[1:34:34] be holding well when he asked me that I
[1:34:37] knew brother Dell wasn't well and I knew
[1:34:39] he couldn't do it and so I told him I
[1:34:41] said well brother brother Robert I said
[1:34:44] I may be able to bring brother Wade with
[1:34:47] me which is his son but I don't think
[1:34:48] brother Dale will be able to come and he
[1:34:50] said oh he felt really bad about that so
[1:34:54] so I'm glad that brother Wade was able
[1:34:55] to come and it wasn't for it wasn't I'll
[1:34:58] just say this it wasn't for brother Dale
[1:35:00] to go during this time it was for
[1:35:01] brother Wade to go because I believe the
[1:35:04] people there needed to hear something
[1:35:06] that he had that that God had to use
[1:35:08] brother Wade you know to tell them if
[1:35:10] brother Dale was meant to be there he
[1:35:12] would have been there I believe that and
[1:35:14] so and I believe if I would have asked
[1:35:16] brother Dale I believe he would have
[1:35:17] probably tried to go if he was being
[1:35:19] asked to but um but I I really enjoyed
[1:35:23] myself during this trip because I don't
[1:35:26] say this because he's my pastor Brother
[1:35:28] D brother Wade's my pastor and he didn't
[1:35:30] tell me to tell you this but I've said
[1:35:32] it before I really really enjoyed
[1:35:35] interpreting for brother Wade because
[1:35:38] the way I thought that it was going to
[1:35:39] be and I knew I know I know in Honduras
[1:35:42] I know what the people need spiritually
[1:35:44] amen and uh I know that this type of
[1:35:48] word is what they need and I knew I know
[1:35:51] that brother Wade could do it and so
[1:35:54] it really was a blessing to them and so
[1:35:56] I appreciate brother way taking his time
[1:35:58] to go but anyways so we'll just go to
[1:36:01] the report and um brother way Wade do
[1:36:03] you fill in in any spot on this if you
[1:36:06] want to say something you know stop me
[1:36:08] then we just go on so um but I don't
[1:36:12] know if the brothers have
[1:36:13] it I have it connected I don't know what
[1:36:16] has to be done on their
[1:36:20] end no
[1:36:28] should be pluged
[1:36:34] in just bear with
[1:36:47] us I thought it was just plug and
[1:36:51] play something that I have to do here
[1:36:53] here no how can we hook it up again
[1:36:59] somewhere um
[1:37:29] H sure come yeah come on sister our our
[1:37:34] lovely humble secretary is going to fill
[1:37:36] in until uh we're going to fill in the
[1:37:48] time I I really don't know what I'm
[1:37:51] going to say but I just thought to while
[1:37:53] they're figuring that
[1:37:56] out
[1:37:58] um so this was a a fun trip because
[1:38:02] brother Wade was
[1:38:05] there and
[1:38:07] um just to give you like
[1:38:10] a there's a preview of it we flew in
[1:38:14] Sunday by Monday the plan was just for
[1:38:18] him to preach that
[1:38:20] evening but of course as we're driving
[1:38:22] from the air airport we get a call and
[1:38:25] said oh we heard your Pastors in town we
[1:38:28] have somebody that wants to get
[1:38:31] baptized so then the plan was okay first
[1:38:34] thing in the morning we're going to find
[1:38:35] someplace to get
[1:38:37] baptized so we drove and out we didn't
[1:38:39] know who this person was we didn't know
[1:38:41] where we were
[1:38:43] going originally it was a man it was a
[1:38:45] man it was a friend of a brother but
[1:38:49] they were just very adamant about we
[1:38:51] want him to be
[1:38:55] baptized so we drove an
[1:38:58] hour we got there and they said we don't
[1:39:02] know where he
[1:39:04] is up so you can just imagine what's
[1:39:07] going through brother Wade's mind when
[1:39:10] we were very afraid to break the news
[1:39:13] but it was great it worked out really
[1:39:15] good well wait a minute
[1:39:29] American walking to a field it wasn't
[1:39:32] his or anybody else's that was there but
[1:39:36] Eric said right here is a place we're
[1:39:37] going to do it so we did it and God God
[1:39:40] did a a work that little girl came to
[1:39:42] the whole service all whole weekend
[1:39:44] whole week anyway so that's it we'll
[1:39:49] start out here so this um this was like
[1:39:51] the day the day after we we we came back
[1:39:54] we we got there so December 16th and we
[1:39:57] were about an hour away from Brother
[1:39:58] Eric's house and we were supposed to
[1:40:00] baptize a certain man and uh we were
[1:40:03] just happy ready to go baptize him rriv
[1:40:05] away and then we get there and the man's
[1:40:07] gone there nowhere to be found so of
[1:40:10] course you know we're going back to
[1:40:12] Eric's house which is an hour back and
[1:40:15] but the people that we were driving with
[1:40:17] there they took us to the to the place
[1:40:20] there was a little girl there that
[1:40:21] wanted to get baptized and so she uh she
[1:40:25] uh she had she had taken her clothes and
[1:40:27] everything changing clothes and
[1:40:29] everything and nobody none of us knew
[1:40:31] that and so uh so um they told us and
[1:40:36] and she said she'd like to get baptized
[1:40:39] and so we stopped by this little creek
[1:40:42] right there on the side of the dirt road
[1:40:45] and we went ahead and and and baptized
[1:40:47] the little girl brother Wade baptized
[1:40:50] her and I was there interpreting right
[1:40:51] off the side of the bank and like you
[1:40:53] said the brother those people they just
[1:40:56] they might be fenc there they'll just
[1:40:57] knock it right down and just go on in
[1:41:00] there and um and so we were there this

[1:43:14] that's that's that night all right so on
[1:43:16] the next day December 17th is when we
[1:43:19] were heading to where the ministers
[1:43:22] meetings were going to be held at it's
[1:43:25] usually a two to three-day meeting where
[1:43:29] where ministers uh brother Aaron's been
[1:43:31] there and but ministers held meetings
[1:43:33] during the morning there's two sessions
[1:43:36] for them one in the morning and one in
[1:43:37] the afternoon and then later that
[1:43:39] evening it's a general meeting under a
[1:43:42] tent for everyone and so everybody can
[1:43:45] can be there and everybody everybody's
[1:43:47] there at the service so we drove about
[1:43:49] four hours from talanga for from where
[1:43:52] we were where brother Eric is from to uh
[1:43:56] chuta or near chuta which an area called
[1:44:00] elor and uh that's where we were at so
[1:44:03] the road the roads are great I've been
[1:44:05] in I've been in Jamaica 11 times in
[1:44:08] it's it's one big dirt
[1:44:09] road but they had really good roads so
[1:44:12] it was it was pretty good on the old man
[1:44:15] okay yeah not to have to hit some
[1:44:18] p and um there was there's not just
[1:44:21] Honduran brothers that go to these
[1:44:23] meetings but there's also brothers from
[1:44:25] El Salvador that was there if you can
[1:44:27] see there El Salvador from Nicaragua uh
[1:44:30] they go to these ministers meeting which
[1:44:32] they hold every two months and Panama
[1:44:34] and also Panama there was Brothers there
[1:44:36] from Panama as well so uh it was about
[1:44:40] 150 pastors or ministers there just just
[1:44:44] the ministers that that doesn't count
[1:44:46] their churches and people I mean there's
[1:44:48] whole churches in buses just going in
[1:44:50] you know so there was a I'd say I'd say
[1:44:54] about 900 something people Al together
[1:44:56] they're Comm
[1:44:58] meting um this is us uh I don't know if
[1:45:01] this video will play but this is us
[1:45:03] going through the capital of Honduras
[1:45:05] this is teus
[1:45:07] galpa um traffic I'm sure brother Don
[1:45:10] and them theyve been through there
[1:45:13] before they're not from this area
[1:45:15] they're actually from up North nor than
[1:45:17] F further away from this area but you
[1:45:19] know you need to go around the the the
[1:45:22] country you you usually have to pass
[1:45:24] through the
[1:45:25] capital all right lot of traffic all
[1:45:29] right and so we uh they we rented this
[1:45:32] little this little van that a brother
[1:45:34] provided for us which was brother
[1:45:36] Lucas's son and we just helped pay for
[1:45:39] it and uh we had some issues with this
[1:45:42] van the Christmas lights were on on the
[1:45:45] dashboard you know
[1:45:48] this we thought they were like Christmas
[1:45:49] lights it was around Christmas time so
[1:45:51] they were blinking you know flashing
[1:45:53] you can say
[1:45:55] something you guys see I took a picture
[1:45:58] of Robert there so obviously they don't
[1:46:00] have car seats so he's sitting on the
[1:46:02] floor and he's using the
[1:46:05] seat for from the coloring books and all
[1:46:08] the crayons that sister Jun sent him so
[1:46:11] he he was pretty much like that the
[1:46:12] whole
[1:46:14] ride yeah when they come here didn't
[1:46:16] hear from him when they when they come
[1:46:18] here they just think it's so strange
[1:46:19] that you have to be restrained on a car
[1:46:21] seat they don't they don't see that they
[1:46:25] think it's weird yeah and so it's hard
[1:46:27] for them to get adjusted to car seats
[1:46:29] and things like that but uh there they
[1:46:31] they don't ride like that so all right
[1:46:34] this is a place where we uh uh where we
[1:46:37] took a little break before get to El
[1:46:40] Tambor now this is Brother Eric's
[1:46:41] parents this is Brother joavan on the

[1:47:12] he's a Brother
[1:47:14] Don I'm telling you we had problems with
[1:47:17] this van several times I can't remember
[1:47:20] what the issue was brother Wade bu pick
[1:47:24] one but every time brother joavan would
[1:47:27] just come we'd just get Brother joavan
[1:47:29] Hey brother joavan he would just walk up
[1:47:31] to the vehicle and the vehicle would
[1:47:33] start he wouldn't even touch it he
[1:47:35] wouldn't even he just looks at it he
[1:47:38] never touch anything he opened the hood
[1:47:40] up and said okay party fine it's like
[1:47:43] the vehicles they're scared of
[1:47:45] him they don't want him touching
[1:47:48] anything of their parts so he says okay
[1:47:50] we're good yeah the vehicle Christine
[1:47:52] said that the the vehicle just says I'm
[1:47:53] joking I'm just joking just a little
[1:47:57] hi all right so um this is where we're
[1:48:01] heading towards the
[1:48:02] campsite it's up a little Hill but uh in
[1:48:06] this is the area called
[1:48:08] elor and uh that's brother joavan in the
[1:48:11] front of us and that's us right there
[1:48:14] Christine taking the video now in this
[1:48:17] in this area right here they would bring
[1:48:19] a lot of uh a lot of uh uh sugar can
[1:48:23] from the top of the hill so it was a big
[1:48:25] business there I don't believe they do
[1:48:27] that anymore but I remember going going
[1:48:30] to this Parts since since 20 uh I
[1:48:33] started first going here in around
[1:48:35] 2017 and I remember on these roads you
[1:48:38] would go there and the whole place would
[1:48:39] just smell like sugar sugar cane oh wow
[1:48:42] it was it was a it was a lovely it was
[1:48:44] like a mixture of of of of n nature with
[1:48:47] sugar cane yeah and they they don't
[1:48:50] smell like that anymore because they
[1:48:51] haven't it hasn't been um they haven't
[1:48:53] been working with the sugar cane anymore
[1:48:55] but that's us going up to the
[1:48:57] campsite and I believe this is the same
[1:48:59] video now this is Brother uh uh Robert's
[1:49:03] Church uh there in elor and uh this is
[1:49:06] just little fence a fence they have out
[1:49:09] there which is pretty nice
[1:49:13] um yes when we first started going there
[1:49:16] it did not look like that back in 2017
[1:49:18] so they' progressively worked on this
[1:49:21] church uh little by little um I don't
[1:49:25] know if yall remember but a couple of
[1:49:28] couple of uh uh two years ago maybe I
[1:49:30] testified that this was the brother who
[1:49:32] was having an issue with a a man who
[1:49:34] wanted to kill him yeah this is the
[1:49:37] church this is the brother yeah and uh
[1:49:40] all that's been taken care of but
[1:49:42] brother brother Robert was put there he
[1:49:45] he he knows that it's of God but he it
[1:49:47] hasn't been easy for him he's have he's
[1:49:50] had to deal with drunk people coming in
[1:49:52] and and threatening his life uh a man
[1:49:55] who has a a man who has a bar uh next to
[1:49:57] his church uh who who who thought that
[1:50:02] brother Robert was in It On in It with
[1:50:05] with the local government to try to shut
[1:50:08] down his bar and everything and brother
[1:50:09] Robert wasn't trying to do that um he
[1:50:12] came to brother Robert threatening his
[1:50:14] life uh last just last year yep and of
[1:50:18] course he was drunk he actually he was
[1:50:20] high on something and uh when he came to
[1:50:23] himself he apologized to brother Robert
[1:50:26] and said I'm so sorry I acted that way
[1:50:28] and so so brother Roberts had had to
[1:50:31] deal with a lot of things like that but
[1:50:32] he still maintains firm and the people
[1:50:34] he has some really good people that are
[1:50:36] helping him out helping him there some
[1:50:38] good brothers
[1:50:40] so uh this is us bringing more chairs
[1:50:43] Under the Tent for that evening general
[1:50:45] service mhm so those chairs that you
[1:50:49] guys see
[1:50:50] like some people actually have that as a
[1:50:53] business they rent those out and so
[1:50:55] there would be a point where they need
[1:50:57] more chairs so they'd have to go around
[1:51:00] and the different places where they know
[1:51:02] and they'll say hey can we rent more
[1:51:05] chairs and so you see them they ENT the
[1:51:07] church out too yeah and then they still
[1:51:09] wouldn't be enough because you'd see a
[1:51:11] bunch of people just outside the tent
[1:51:13] they mostly would just eventually give
[1:51:15] the seats to the mothers and the
[1:51:17] children and the Remain the brothers
[1:51:19] would just be around the tent and the
[1:51:22] last service brother Wade asked
[1:51:24] everybody to go under the tent but there
[1:51:27] was there was just no room but there was
[1:51:28] just so many people outside the tent we
[1:51:31] all just had to squeeze in under
[1:51:33] there yeah and and there's there's no
[1:51:36] hotels nearby or anything like that for
[1:51:38] the all these ministers pastors coming
[1:51:40] from different countries for them to go
[1:51:42] and oh we're going to go to a nice hotel
[1:51:44] a holiday in no no they're all sleeping
[1:51:47] they have these little Cs and they put
[1:51:50] all line up all these CS inside the
[1:51:52] church inside the sanctuary and when the
[1:51:55] sanctuary isn't being used and that's
[1:51:57] where the majority sleep and these are
[1:52:00] pastors you know small and U but that's
[1:52:03] what they've gotten used to do you know
[1:52:05] and so they're really uh and families
[1:52:09] families nearby in their houses they
[1:52:12] would hold three or four families you
[1:52:15] know they find a way it to just fit
[1:52:17] everybody in there
[1:52:20] mhm so this is Brother Wade everyone
[1:52:23] wanted to meet brother Wade also known
[1:52:25] asmano
[1:52:27] Samuel had a hard time with my name cuz
[1:52:29] they could not say his
[1:52:31] name they could not say brother
[1:52:34] Wade and so uh they just say we just
[1:52:37] tell them just call him brother Wade I
[1:52:39] mean brother Samuel yeah and so majority
[1:52:42] of them that's what they call him that
[1:52:45] my name is actually close to a name was
[1:52:46] not very
[1:52:49] good yes so they quit calling me that
[1:52:52] probably why they don't want yeah it's
[1:52:54] like
[1:52:55] a donkey or
[1:52:58] something look it
[1:53:00] up q e y I think you I I I may explain
[1:53:04] to you later on in a private
[1:53:06] session private
[1:53:09] conversation well because they're
[1:53:11] dies so I'd be brother
[1:53:14] W so I said hey Samuel's good most of
[1:53:16] y'all are Nam Samuel anyway so just call
[1:53:19] me mhm
[1:53:23] so uh this was the first night of the
[1:53:26] meetings umad actually one service the
[1:53:30] pastor
[1:53:31] couldn't um introduce me he had um Eric
[1:53:36] to do it because he was afraid he'd say
[1:53:37] the wrong name that other
[1:53:40] name
[1:53:42] so brother Eric did it yeah brother
[1:53:45] Robert he's he just came to me and said
[1:53:48] hey can I just call him Samuel brother
[1:53:49] Samuel I said sure I mean that's his
[1:53:52] name name yeah we just know him here by
[1:53:54] Brother
[1:53:56] Wade um so that yes this night I I was
[1:54:00] the for opening night and I I ministered
[1:54:02] that night and uh we had a really
[1:54:04] wonderful service we did amen and uh so
[1:54:09] now the second day of the meetings this
[1:54:11] was me and brother Wade brother Wade uh
[1:54:15] Samuel brother Samuel sorry brother
[1:54:17] Samuel there was about 150 ministers
[1:54:20] there and uh
[1:54:23] brother Wade I don't know if you want to
[1:54:25] kind of just go over a little bit of
[1:54:26] what you mentioned well we was just
[1:54:28] talking about the when Jesus Took the
[1:54:30] when brother BR said it was the greatest
[1:54:31] anointing there was when Jesus Took the
[1:54:33] book sat down and opened the book the
[1:54:36] book was closed we spoke on it here the
[1:54:39] book was closed given to Jesus he opened
[1:54:41] it read identified himself closed it and
[1:54:43] give it back to him I just typed it all
[1:54:45] the way through the message so MH and
[1:54:48] one
[1:54:49] time I paused
[1:54:53] and the Lord got a hold of Louise and he
[1:54:56] finished my whole s he finished about
[1:54:58] two sentences that I was going to say
[1:54:59] and I stopped cuz I was going to pause
[1:55:01] and let him and he just said what I was
[1:55:03] going to say praise the Lord I just
[1:55:05] looked over him and you know he just
[1:55:07] kept going that's exactly what I was
[1:55:09] going to
[1:55:11] say so you get caught up in that's
[1:55:14] good I I I I get I get caught up with it
[1:55:18] because obviously you know it's a word
[1:55:20] that we love right amen and and God by
[1:55:23] God's grace you know he's been able to
[1:55:24] reveal that to us but I know that the
[1:55:26] people needed that as well and so I'm
[1:55:29] going to give everything that I have you
[1:55:31] know to it that's right and uh and they
[1:55:34] really my they were there just they were
[1:55:37] en really enjoyed it those I thought
[1:55:38] they was going to
[1:55:40] come because when he got to the point he
[1:55:42] got to a point talking about uh typing
[1:55:45] the seven Church ages with with with uh
[1:55:48] David's Seven Brothers you know uh and
[1:55:51] that they never had seen that typee
[1:55:54] before like that and and just different
[1:55:56] things like that any they just really
[1:55:58] really rejoiced so so wild brother way
[1:56:00] and so these are all the brothers the
[1:56:02] sisters weren't allowed inside in there
[1:56:04] so we were outside cooking just behind
[1:56:07] where they are so we can hear them so
[1:56:09] we're cooking back there and we would
[1:56:11] just hear everybody just roaring yeah
[1:56:14] and we were like oh something's
[1:56:16] happening in there yeah there they are
[1:56:19] yeah this is this is a a front Church
[1:56:23] actually yeah right yes that's brother
[1:56:25] Robert's Church add something in there
[1:56:28] sure so when um actually they thought
[1:56:32] brother Wade went too short they wanted
[1:56:34] they were saying we're not done with
[1:56:36] we're not done with with lunch but so I
[1:56:41] knew that it was hot in there it's super
[1:56:43] hot in that church so when I heard that
[1:56:46] they were finishing so I go and meet
[1:56:47] brother Wade and you can just see he was
[1:56:50] just pale I don't know if you remember
[1:56:53] he was just pale and he said I need some
[1:56:57] a
[1:56:58] tall something of caffeine like he just
[1:57:01] he was just you could see his energy was
[1:57:03] just he was gone he was ready to just
[1:57:06] drop so I'm like okay just sit down
[1:57:08] because and and it made sense because
[1:57:11] there was just so much going on inside
[1:57:13] of there there was just so much virtue
[1:57:14] you know people really pulled and you
[1:57:16] could really see that he was just like I
[1:57:19] need to sit down but I need something so
[1:57:21] that was
[1:57:22] that was something they made coffee in
[1:57:25] the biggest walk I ever seen in my life
[1:57:28] Aaron you seen it B you seen it you walk
[1:57:30] out there and want some coffee and
[1:57:32] they're
[1:57:34] like Arline it's this big around and
[1:57:37] that deep and it's all coffee under an
[1:57:40] open open fire absolutely under an open
[1:57:43] fire and now like you want some coffee
[1:57:45] yeah he's like said I hope the cats
[1:57:47] hadn't been in there I didn't care at
[1:57:49] that point in time though but those
[1:57:51] sisters from the day they begin that
[1:57:54] meeting till the day they leave they fix
[1:57:56] food for 800 people 00 people per
[1:58:01] service three times three times a day
[1:58:04] three times a day I'm not talking about
[1:58:06] one me I'm talking about three times a
[1:58:07] day but these are sisters from different
[1:58:10] countries so you see um from El Salvador
[1:58:14] from Nicaragua so they're from this
[1:58:16] different churches and really I guess
[1:58:19] they're just so used to just okay we're
[1:58:21] going to do this and everybody just does
[1:58:23] something and there's a lot of them that
[1:58:27] that had done that so it it's really a
[1:58:30] really group effort I mean the first
[1:58:31] night you got a lot of chickens running
[1:58:33] around the second night there's not as
[1:58:36] many third night
[1:58:41] crickets no I mean listen they fed us
[1:58:44] you see that big old thing right there
[1:58:46] an
[1:58:48] yeah yeah that's a that's a paddle
[1:58:52] that's what they stiring
[1:58:54] that but we went outside and admonished
[1:58:56] his sisters and prayed with them cuz
[1:58:59] that's a it's a it's an ordeal I mean a
[1:59:01] big time
[1:59:04] ordeal I don't know if you anything else
[1:59:07] oh um most of the time brother Wade
[1:59:09] would ask for for Mountain Dew and I'd
[1:59:11] be like
[1:59:12] no or he would want like a soda and like
[1:59:15] no that's not good for you but that one
[1:59:18] day I took my mother with me that I was
[1:59:21] respons ible for two people
[1:59:24] so so but that one after that service
[1:59:27] where you see his face he was just pale
[1:59:30] I'm like I'm going to get you soda yeah
[1:59:33] she did you need soda thank
[1:59:36] you big sod probably some of the
[1:59:40] sweetest people you'll ever see in your
[1:59:42] life even I even from the people at the
[1:59:46] airport um drivers people that weren't
[1:59:48] Christians they were
[1:59:50] just I mean you go go to other places
[1:59:53] you know Jamaica 11 times the Phil even
[1:59:54] the Philippines if you're not if they
[1:59:56] don't know you they'll walk right past
[1:59:57] you but these people just so jovial and
[2:00:01] and and happy and I appreciate that
[2:00:06] yes so that was the uh the after the
[2:00:09] morning service brother Wade made sure
[2:00:11] to greet the sisters and that that's
[2:00:13] good that's good you i' I've been to
[2:00:16] places where some of the brothers they
[2:00:17] go and they just they just want to go
[2:00:19] back to the hotel you know I think it
[2:00:22] they want to be with the people you know
[2:00:23] and I I I want to be with the people I
[2:00:26] want to be with because that's where you
[2:00:27] can there's certain other type of
[2:00:29] ministry that you can do like that right
[2:00:32] that you can't do from the pulpit right
[2:00:33] on a personal level you know and I know
[2:00:36] brother Aaron was he he he he he wanted
[2:00:38] to be with the people as well when we
[2:00:40] went and so I believe that's very
[2:00:42] important amen and I think it made a
[2:00:44] huge impact that right after service
[2:00:46] brother Wade was right there with with
[2:00:49] the sisters because the sisters were
[2:00:51] like
[2:00:52] they were saying to me the food's not
[2:00:54] ready why is he here I'm like no it's
[2:00:56] okay he just wants to say hi you know
[2:00:59] yeah they they thought he was just like
[2:01:01] I want to eat now you know but it wasn't
[2:01:04] that he just wanted to I mean you know
[2:01:07] how brother way is I just want to be
[2:01:10] around say hello to people I want to see
[2:01:11] how they could fix for that many people
[2:01:14] so three meals and I mean they were good
[2:01:16] meals too they weren't just potato chips
[2:01:19] and crackers right no I I said them
[2:01:22] chickens they running for their
[2:01:25] life all right let's continue here this
[2:01:28] is a where we where we had car trouble
[2:01:30] in one of the places where we had
[2:01:31] stalled and right next to the road and
[2:01:34] there these trucks just passing right by
[2:01:36] me there was there was nothing that you
[2:01:38] can I mean we had to sit there and try
[2:01:40] to work on the vehicle with uh I didn't
[2:01:43] know what I was doing good thing we had
[2:01:44] brother Allan there with us uh from
[2:01:47] Nicaragua but they just big old 18 wheel
[2:01:50] just zooming right next to you blow the
[2:01:53] car over I told Louise one time I said
[2:01:55] get in this car stand up there so that
[2:01:58] that
[2:01:59] morning was the ministers meeting but
[2:02:01] it's only for the local ministers the
[2:02:04] second part was yes that morning so we
[2:02:07] were going back we had we took the
[2:02:09] opportunity that morning to visit um a
[2:02:13] little boy a baby yes so we'll we'll
[2:02:16] show a picture we're on our way to that
[2:02:19] but getting to that baby seemed to be
[2:02:21] imp possible yes so and so we kept
[2:02:25] having the car trouble with this vehicle
[2:02:28] because uh brother javani came he got it
[2:02:31] going but then when we got to the place
[2:02:33] near the house where the baby was at uh
[2:02:36] we had trouble with it again it was a
[2:02:38] diesel and I Donnie can correct me but I
[2:02:41] smell diesel fuel the whole time get a
[2:02:43] headache like you wouldn't believe but
[2:02:46] if you have a small leak in a diesel
[2:02:48] motor doesn't it won't it lose its
[2:02:50] pressure and then shut down
[2:02:52] mhm cuz there's no there's no there's no
[2:02:55] electric pump like you have in a gas
[2:02:56] motor that keeps them keeps the fuel
[2:02:59] coming um and um diesel it it's from
[2:03:04] suction and I could smell it so it had a
[2:03:07] little little areas that what it just
[2:03:09] wasn't right and then we get out and
[2:03:11] start
[2:03:11] pushing
[2:03:14] Manpower they went out and started P
[2:03:17] yeah I said I'm whipped guys there was a
[2:03:20] a man out there just a random man
[2:03:28] by Hey Brother wait have worked hard you

[2:04:18] had happened was his they wanted us to
[2:04:20] come and pray for yes because the home
[2:04:24] it's a very sad story yeah um um do you
[2:04:27] want to go ahead and say it the the his
[2:04:29] dad um who was there pushing helping us
[2:04:32] with the vehicle he he we were going to
[2:04:34] meet him at the Wendy so that he could
[2:04:35] take us to the house where the baby was
[2:04:37] at and so when he came he helped us with
[2:04:40] the vehicle got it started and
[2:04:42] everything but what happened with what
[2:04:44] happened is that in DEC was it last in
[2:04:47] December of
[2:04:48] 2020 November November November was it
[2:04:53] last year oh it was one year before well

[2:05:03] something like that found his love of
[2:05:05] his life and got and she got pregnant
[2:05:08] and then now she got pregnant and uh she

[2:05:18] practice in the hospital where they were
[2:05:21] at

[2:05:26] yeah so it was very bittersweet she was
[2:05:30] very young too 23 years old 23 yeah so
[2:05:34] we went to their home to give them some
[2:05:35] comfort and the mother was just
[2:05:36] devastated and the sister too yeah and
[2:05:39] the father that's the father right there
[2:05:40] holding his brother Jimmy right there

[2:05:47] Lord's Lord it was Lord doing it what
[2:05:50] yeah whatever it is he'll know it that's
[2:05:51] that's what I told him I said whatever
[2:05:52] it is the Lord the Lord will reveal it

[2:06:08] little bit of money she was a seamstress
[2:06:10] and oh primitive like you wouldn't ever
[2:06:13] believe but she she was a seamstress in
[2:06:15] the community and so um she's taking it
[2:06:19] very hard because that's her youngest

[2:06:23] passed away so young 23 years old you
[2:06:26] know had everything going for them and
[2:06:29] and uh and then their life just her life

[2:07:00] worse so we give him some money for that
[2:07:02] for Navy l no no okay we talked about oh
[2:07:06] we talked okay
[2:07:12] okay
[2:07:14] okay okay then sounds good
[2:07:19] yeah that's awesome thank you sister
[2:07:23] okay so this is uh uh this is Brother
[2:07:25] Ayah Costa uh right here on the left
[2:07:28] he's one of the brothers he's an
[2:07:30] evangelist brother that we help support
[2:07:32] here in the church on a monthly basis
[2:07:34] and this is Brother Allan right here on
[2:07:36] the left the uh he we also help him on a
[2:07:40] monthly basis as well and so um uh
[2:07:45] brother Allen traveled by bus from
[2:07:48] Nicaragua yeah can Allan he's a big guy
[2:07:52] and the girls love him because they love
[2:07:55] traveling with him because when the
[2:07:57] girls don't want to eat their food and I
[2:07:59] always tell them you got to finish your
[2:08:01] food you know like don't you have to
[2:08:03] finish it even if you don't like it
[2:08:05] finish it you're going to get hungry
[2:08:06] later so what they'll do is they'll
[2:08:08] nudge brother Allan and be like brother
[2:08:11] Allan do you want some and they'll just
[2:08:13] give everything to him and he's more
[2:08:16] than happy to to take it look like it
[2:08:19] happened often
[2:08:21] brother Allan would already eaten his
[2:08:23] meal maybe his kids meals and then we
[2:08:26] ask him hey do you want to finish this
[2:08:28] one sure yeah
[2:08:30] sure but he he's a a really awesome
[2:08:33] brother yeah we were with him at one
[2:08:36] trip I don't remember where in the
[2:08:38] mountains and we found out that a dog
[2:08:40] bit him on the
[2:08:41] leg and he's like oh yeah it's okay and
[2:08:45] then as the day as the days went on
[2:08:47] apparently it was getting worse and he
[2:08:49] was just preaching kept on preaching
[2:08:51] till he went back home and said yeah I
[2:08:52] got to go to the doctor and get this
[2:08:54] checked out but they're they're really
[2:08:56] rugged Brothers the brother Eli and
[2:08:58] brother Allan they go down to the
[2:09:00] jungles of Honduras and Nicaragua uh
[2:09:03] they preach there and so they're just
[2:09:05] very very rugged um brother Bob knows
[2:09:08] brother Allen and uh so that's why I
[2:09:11] felt that you know that uh that's
[2:09:13] they're they're just missionaries
[2:09:15] locally to the area and so I'm glad that
[2:09:18] we we can help support it just pray for
[2:09:20] them because they're desire they're
[2:09:21] young but they have good strong desire
[2:09:24] to Amen to spread the the word this
[2:09:26] message they love this message
[2:09:28] absolutely kid all right so this was the
[2:09:31] last night of the ministers meeting
[2:09:32] there were approximately 800 Believers
[2:09:34] under that tent and brother Wade just he
[2:09:38] didn't preach a fiery sermon like you
[2:09:40] know uh uh Andrew Glover style but he
[2:09:43] brought it down home and it was
[2:09:45] something that needed it that that was
[2:09:47] needed and he spoke about love and uh it
[2:09:51] was a wonderful atmosphere after the
[2:09:54] service it was but at the end of the
[2:09:56] service I kind of the
[2:10:00] day studying thought about having a
[2:10:04] prayer line but my
[2:10:06] word there was 800 people there so I
[2:10:10] just had them all gather as close as
[2:10:11] they could and they all just laid hands
[2:10:13] on each other and we just had a about a
[2:10:15] 15minute prayer service and people got
[2:10:18] delivered people got healed it went good
[2:10:21] good yeah you don't have to have a
[2:10:23] prayer line every time you have a
[2:10:25] service but yes so we still get messages
[2:10:28] about that service yeah about that
[2:10:31] sermon how simple it was but yet it was
[2:10:34] it was very
[2:10:35] needed
[2:10:36] um you know I'll say this you know a a
[2:10:41] lot of the a lot of the ministry there
[2:10:43] in these countries you know they it's
[2:10:45] almost like
[2:10:47] U it's almost like that it's a it's a
[2:10:50] it's kind of like a macho type Ty type
[2:10:53] Spirit you know like you know and so
[2:10:55] they really preach a lot against the
[2:10:56] women and how they should dress and a
[2:10:58] lot of clothline type of things so when
[2:11:01] you bring things that are a little
[2:11:03] different from that what the message
[2:11:04] really is
[2:11:05] about I mean hairess and all that stuff
[2:11:08] the brother before that the story I had
[2:11:10] already had this sermon I was going to
[2:11:12] preach it so that was not I didn't
[2:11:13] change it right yeah but the brother
[2:11:15] that spoke before they was a sister
[2:11:17] there 800 people under that tent and
[2:11:19] about where maybe where brother uh and
[2:11:22] sister sitting back here um brother M
[2:11:26] there was a sister comes in and she's
[2:11:28] got like fishing lure earrings I mean
[2:11:31] they were hanging down and very wide and
[2:11:33] they you know anyway she was a visitor
[2:11:37] she come visiting had on pair of pants
[2:11:39] well that poor
[2:11:41] preacher sent her to
[2:11:43] Hell brought her back out sent her back
[2:11:46] again the whole time he preached on the
[2:11:49] not the whole time but
[2:11:52] so that next night buddy I let him have
[2:11:54] it with love but I did it with
[2:11:58] [Applause]
[2:11:59] love I asked him I told him I looked at
[2:12:02] him and I looked right down the preacher
[2:12:03] was sitting right there and I told him I
[2:12:04] said how long did it take you to accept
[2:12:07] this
[2:12:07] message of course the whole place is
[2:12:10] dead
[2:12:11] silence I said see there some of y'all
[2:12:14] are thinking in your mind months years I
[2:12:18] said so there's not one person going to
[2:12:20] get it at one night
[2:12:22] right so let's love them and not and and
[2:12:25] and it's not that everybody is like that
[2:12:27] it's not it's just that some of them
[2:12:29] they get I guess a little bit carried
[2:12:31] away in in that because that's the easy
[2:12:33] part of the of of this of the message
[2:12:35] yeah preaching against people and about
[2:12:36] how they dress and about how they look
[2:12:38] that's easy you know but when you start
[2:12:41] breaking down the word that's what they
[2:12:42] need and she did not come back to Second
[2:12:45] the night I she wasn't I was hoping
[2:12:47] she'd come back but so she wasn't there
[2:12:50] so anyways but that was the last night
[2:12:52] and uh we had a really really good time
[2:12:55] in the Lord and Brethren really
[2:12:56] appreciate they they came up that they
[2:12:58] uh brought the people that helped in the
[2:13:00] camp there and uh from different
[2:13:03] churches who helped out and they they uh
[2:13:05] acknowledged them uh and thank them for
[2:13:08] their service during those those days of
[2:13:10] the camp all right those sisters didn't
[2:13:13] perspire they
[2:13:16] sweat to fix that food for them I mean
[2:13:19] they stood over a fire for
[2:13:22] hours cooking so yeah all right and then
[2:13:26] um uh we went to Brother Eric's church
[2:13:30] this is Brother Eric's church and we
[2:13:31] preached there on that Sunday I believe
[2:13:33] it was Friday on Friday night okay and
[2:13:36] then uh we ministered there had a
[2:13:38] wonderful time um I don't know if I'm
[2:13:42] missing something about that service but
[2:13:44] brother got a really nice church for
[2:13:46] sweet people so that's that's the church
[2:13:49] there now we after uh the next day we
[2:13:52] went up and had some fellowship at up in
[2:13:54] in another area about an hour away from
[2:13:55] where brother Eric lives and this is
[2:13:58] Brother Melo brother Melo he is
[2:14:01] U he he's he's a very well-known Pastor
[2:14:05] there in Honduras and but he's sick he
[2:14:08] has uh he has Alzheimer's or dementia
[2:14:11] and so uh you just pray for him um uh
[2:14:15] the actually during this time he was act
[2:14:17] actually a little better because they've
[2:14:19] been trying to work with him on that
[2:14:21] yeah on a natural basis and so didn't he
[2:14:24] have one of the first churches or the
[2:14:25] biggest church he had he had the biggest
[2:14:27] church in Honduras okay and and so so it
[2:14:31] just you know it kind of his his his it
[2:14:35] just kind of reminds me of what we went
[2:14:36] through here with then that's what that
[2:14:38] church there is going through right now
[2:14:39] yeah and so uh he might be small but he
[2:14:43] packed a punch I tell you that wonderful
[2:14:46] brother all right and then then we had
[2:14:48] some fellowship at some brothers uh
[2:14:51] brother Maul's house uh there in
[2:14:52] Honduras there were some brothers uh
[2:14:54] from Nicaragua they were there as well
[2:14:56] brother Manuel who's a pastor who's the
[2:14:58] one sitting there in the uh seat and he
[2:15:00] was there waiting for us uh brother Bob
[2:15:02] knows brother
[2:15:03] Manuel and then uh this is uh we stayed
[2:15:07] that last night before we left um uh to
[2:15:11] come back home we stayed there at
[2:15:12] brother Milo's house brother MCO is the
[2:15:14] son of the brother who I just told you
[2:15:16] who was who's sick the pastor who who
[2:15:19] who was sick um and so that's his family
[2:15:22] right there so this was us getting ready
[2:15:24] to go to the Ser to the church that
[2:15:27] morning and uh the last service this is
[2:15:31] 3 hours before flying back
[2:15:33] home so brother wait this church is huge
[2:15:39] it's like a compound we park on the we
[2:15:42] park on the the street that goes down we
[2:15:45] parked
[2:15:46] there they had to be six stories that
[2:15:49] church is six stories there's different
[2:15:51] levels there's a level here for people
[2:15:53] to have musicians and practice and then
[2:15:55] they had a place where the sanctuary
[2:15:56] used to be and it's huge they don't use
[2:15:58] it anymore you're going up a little
[2:15:59] higher to Sunday School classes you're
[2:16:00] going up a little higher that then you
[2:16:02] go up a little higher and there's a
[2:16:03] balcony on the top well they told me
[2:16:05] they said when we leave we're going out
[2:16:07] the back
[2:16:11] door I just went
[2:16:13] up eight flights of
[2:16:15] stairs how we going to get out the back
[2:16:17] door without going back
[2:16:19] down it was built on on a hill so when
[2:16:22] we walked the back door we were right in
[2:16:24] the street but that's how steep that
[2:16:26] thing was and they built it you know
[2:16:28] like in layers all the way up and it
[2:16:30] it's a big church it's almost a type of
[2:16:33] place that you think a helicopter is
[2:16:35] going to come the helipad at the top and
[2:16:37] just go pick you up you know and take
[2:16:39] you that's kind of like I told Lise when
[2:16:41] we were sitting in a pastor study I said
[2:16:43] I hope you know how to get out of here
[2:16:45] we went through like eight different
[2:16:47] doors two flights of stairs just to get
[2:16:48] in the
[2:16:49] sanctuary but it so y'all pray for this
[2:16:53] church because they've been having some
[2:16:55] issues with their pastor's not there CU
[2:16:57] they're pastor and so what's been
[2:16:59] happening is some of the ministry within
[2:17:01] the
[2:17:02] congregation they've uh they're getting
[2:17:04] into believe the sign type stuff yeah um
[2:17:08] not believing the message not saying
[2:17:09] that you know brother bram's not a
[2:17:11] prophet and just things like that and so
[2:17:13] there's like an internal struggle within
[2:17:15] the church and so just remember that
[2:17:18] church in prayer all right so this was
[2:17:21] the the the just real quick uh brother
[2:17:23] Dale's last missionary support on the
[2:17:26] left was what what what the little
[2:17:29] kitchen that brother Robert was
[2:17:30] requesting that they upgrade because he
[2:17:32] knew two years later this they're going
[2:17:35] to have these meetings there yeah and so
[2:17:37] they wanted to give the best that they
[2:17:39] could but just to add the the before
[2:17:42] picture of the kitchen they held the
[2:17:44] same meeting with that kitchen yes s
[2:17:46] years before that the first time we went
[2:17:48] there they had the same meeting and
[2:17:50] that's what they used that's that's the
[2:17:53] kitchen that's all the that's all she
[2:17:55] had and so on the right you see the blue
[2:17:58] thing back there it's what they call a
[2:18:00] Pila and that's where they have all the
[2:18:02] water so that helped out a lot having
[2:18:05] that water there because before we would
[2:18:07] constantly have to ask the brothers to
[2:18:09] like bring us more water bring us more
[2:18:11] water so that was very helpful so on the
[2:18:14] right there where you see the Pila the
[2:18:16] blue box that was added on and you see
[2:18:19] where the black tarp is is that's where
[2:18:22] the kitchen is so that's where we were
[2:18:25] cooking and so they were able to expand
[2:18:28] that in the back there was 20 gallons in
[2:18:30] that pot with a coffee at
[2:18:33] least yeah at least so they that the
[2:18:37] place was expanded and that was one of
[2:18:38] the requests that brother Robert had
[2:18:40] asked and uh it was it was made possible
[2:18:43] and and that's the sister's personal
[2:18:45] kitchen because she lives behind the
[2:18:47] church yeah brother brother Robert was
[2:18:50] also asking if that we could he could
[2:18:52] have a pastor's study because the study
[2:18:55] was his his his bedroom the church
[2:18:59] church connected was connected to his
[2:19:00] house so he would come from his bedroom
[2:19:04] and go in and straight to the pulpit you
[2:19:07] know and so he wanted to have a little
[2:19:09] place you know for like a minister study
[2:19:12] as well um so that not everybody's going
[2:19:15] to his bedroom you know so so we I
[2:19:20] brought the need meet up and this is
[2:19:22] what those funds went to help as well
[2:19:25] and they have a little nice study right
[2:19:27] next to to the to the entrance to the
[2:19:29] pulpit of of the of the church
[2:19:32] there um and also a little uh some
[2:19:35] bathrooms were added uh as well four
[2:19:38] bathrooms were added one of them had had
[2:19:40] a shower included prior to this brother
[2:19:42] Robert shared his home bathroom with his
[2:19:45] congre with 800
[2:19:47] people well they and everybody would
[2:19:50] would like just go different places
[2:19:52] different houses around locally and and
[2:19:54] uh and so uh Zoe had an experience with
[2:19:58] that Christine can tell she can tell
[2:20:01] about it we knocked at a random person's
[2:20:03] house that was back in 2018 Zoe was 6
[2:20:06] years old yeah but they were just like
[2:20:09] brother Wade said it didn't matter who
[2:20:11] you were they were going to let they
[2:20:12] were letting us in right so so those
[2:20:16] bathrooms weren't there now they have a
[2:20:18] good a good place to go I mean
[2:20:21] a lot of people you have to go to the
[2:20:22] bathroom so right so I I do want to add
[2:20:27] that you know there were at least 800
[2:20:30] people so if you see in the corner there
[2:20:32] where you see the little cushions it's
[2:20:34] just right outside that bathroom so
[2:20:36] people were sleeping there people were
[2:20:38] sleeping right there that's because they
[2:20:40] just any space that you can find and you
[2:20:43] can put a little cushion then that's
[2:20:45] where you're sleeping that
[2:20:47] night and on the side there when the
[2:20:49] window that's where brother Robert is
[2:20:52] that's their house yeah
[2:20:56] yeah yeah so that's what that the last
[2:20:59] thing that that that U dad had any
[2:21:02] dealings with was to give them support
[2:21:04] for that so yes so we wanted to be there
[2:21:07] and support dad and um and so I'm glad
[2:21:11] that we were able to do that um and I
[2:21:14] appreciate brother Wade's willingness to
[2:21:16] to have gone I appreciate your prayers
[2:21:19] and uh remember us in April that we're
[2:21:22] going to be there in uh again to uh
[2:21:26] attend a youth camp uh brother Eric's

[2:22:25] morning it was 65
[2:22:28] degre and it wasn't a lot of humidity
[2:22:30] now you go to
[2:22:32] Jamaica the only difference in the
[2:22:34] summer and the winter is what wind blows
[2:22:35] and the wind don't it's
[2:22:37] 90 90 in January 90 in July so that's
[2:22:41] the tropical weather but their weather
[2:22:42] was was really nice and we sure uh we
[2:22:45] sure had a good time we appreciate all
[2:22:47] of you all your support um let's stand
[2:22:50] our feet um also we had decided when we
[2:22:54] got there since um they're having
[2:22:57] meetings again later on is we are going
[2:23:01] to uh put brother Robert an air
[2:23:03] conditioner in his church so yeah praise
[2:23:07] the Lord you should have been in that
[2:23:08] thing with 120 something preachers and

[2:23:14] they had a fan behind us that was about
[2:23:16] it and then some saing fans that was
[2:23:18] just blowing hot air so uh we going to

[2:23:34] glad God sent us a prophet from
[2:23:37] America so that we could get the a lot
[2:23:39] more benefit than them because we get it
[2:23:42] in our language but now we can take
[2:23:44] whatever we can get as a prosperous
[2:23:46] nation and we can give it to people like
[2:23:48] that and their brothers and sisters it's
[2:23:50] not just is helping the poor is helping

[2:26:04] preach but he was if you see the U I
[2:26:07] would back up and he'd make a point and
[2:26:10] and I made a point one time like I said

[2:26:39] church I'm telling you folks there's
[2:26:42] there's churches and and there's nothing
[2:26:44] wrong with it brother brandham said the
[2:26:46] tithe goes to the ministry goes to the
[2:26:48] pastor okay whatever he does with us his
[2:26:51] business but Dad never did that he took
[2:26:54] a salary and he put the rest in a pile
[2:26:57] and that's what we used out of that pile
[2:26:59] was um the amount of money that we send
[2:27:02] overseas and for the different ones a
[2:27:04] lot of churches if brother Luis was
[2:27:06] going to other small churches he'd have
[2:27:08] to pay for everything we try to support
[2:27:10] him as much as we can and all of you
[2:27:12] that go somewhere at least pay in your
[2:27:13] your airplane Bill and and give you an
[2:27:15] offering to take over there but a lot of
[2:27:17] churches can't do that but we can and I
