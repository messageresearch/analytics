========================================

thank you Brian their words simmer down is that like I've been very workers out the trick about that request anything we're going on that's how those that so you can act testing services there that's all those who are sick always run out here Farley blessings was tough oh I want to pick up right where I left off on the last lesson which I was going into a testimony kind of about hand graphics a meeting and that ties into this lesson really so y'all remember me telling you for the morning here this is this is Gabbie 16 years old right before coming to the message she was adopted into a message home and they have taught her about brother brothers message and she accepted it to Christ and then that's what she changed it to just a short comment so what I was counting y'all about last time is the symbology behind our meeting place and why was significant to me and then I did not see this when we first met this was not something that I had seen until years later but basically the story goes like this that we had actually been for the first time in the same location together one month prior to this at the Alabama camp through no six it was the last Alabama camping a lot of girl were there Josh testified about the car wreck I think Tyler said something about this or helping him with his homework a lot of how young people have testified I testified about the depression and then you have a got up testified about how about also overcoming depression so both of us in our life said gone through depression about the same time overcoming about the same time and we're testified at the same camp that about the same comment about the depression but she had prayed and asked the Lord to let me come talk to her because she was she wanted come talk to me I didn't think anything about her other than that it was ironic that she and I had a similar test but I didn't think anything about it she came she tried to get some friends together coming the perch is too shy to come talk to me they were all busy talking with her boyfriends and whatnot so she never could let that whole camp pass by she never did come talk to him and she said well just a bigger will well a month later her pastor brother Luther Dishman and Kentucky and host of the camera and it was at this campground and I've heard about it we've been invited joseline hope I think we're the man's oyster nope no I'm sorry I think from here that Lampley car pulled up there together and on Saturday afternoon October 14th it was 11 years ago yesterday I actually saw her sitting there by herself like that I've always hated to see young people sitting along to me because you know especially the youth camp you know you have all these cliques different people will stay in our comfort zones and all I'm going to try to them but in the kid that's left out didn't know why she was sitting alone but I just came over there to invite her she wouldn't come she was working on her little art book there she had been drawing a sketch of something on the campground and hello our first meeting was maybe two minutes long nothing really transpired that was pretty spectacular and I didn't see the little working and all the way but as I walked away a thought struck me from like without that said you know you need to get to know this girl and it was a really really strong feeling it wasn't just like it was made that she's just another pretty girl sitting on wrong in my mind didn't think anything over you know but then that thought struck me and said you need to get to go to get to know this girl and I was too shy to ask for a phone or anything the camp was nearly and we're fixing the dollar several ways that they've you never meet again so I commit it to the Lord I said north of day or will they work out for us to get her phone and she was too shy I was too shy that's what I'm going to work long story short it worked out that we got each other's phone numbers to stay in contact and we were engaged six months after that now a whole lot of more work working in that that waiting to see until your play here for us are tell you about the trees were symbolic of our lives to try consecrated of Christ we are new Christians so you would think that these would be like little saplings instead of fully grown trees but the fact is God knows in the mind of God everything is already finished working he knew when I started with Christ where I was going to go he knew that she was where she was gonna go and even though we're both new Christians he couldn't represent us in symbology in fully grown trees and that's something significant but then the whole entire thing was like a scene unfolding like a play in the mind of God that I believe that really he bought out before the world and and of course is something that I kind of thought about teaching on on sacrament go that way but it still is relevant that our lives if your predestinated to come to to Christ I believe our whole lives are in a sense laid out there's things in it that I want to take place I believe I've thought out a lot of the significant things in our lives before conventional world that there's just like a great big play unfolding we're just saying is like we're in the mind of God you know it's on the floor egman to comment about that years ago we're seeing the line with God and fold right after we met that was a little skip that happened in this little Billy do you remember that such joy today okay well I've never heard of the Kauffman family I had heard the store go down told about the man that there was a man man lives are of like Armour company or something like that all the bunch of ranches he sent his son down to I guess to Texas or somewhere like that and to meet a girl or channel to a like a Jubilee top of San Jose going on see all these different girls and final wife right I always girls present themselves to him and they were flirty and all those things he went out and to try to get away from all that Tom in front and he found this little similarly nobody on the back step that still girl all his character happened to be what he was looking for because he loves you for the protector this is actually the story of Christ looking for a bride right for the ground toll that story I believe God likes that story cause it says on the story he came down from heaven to look for bride he turned out all these denominations all their palm and bride and all those things and he meet something with his character all right happened to be that the very verses of that song I won't go through it for the second time but if you fall down the version of that song every single one I'm almost lines up with my knee got his story ironically down to the knot every little word but nearly and right after we had just met we went down there and they performed that play her youth group she wasn't in it but her youth group put on that play in this little building and we all watched it and there was no worse they were actually just acting and out while playing the common feeling song the promise okay and I'll sitting there not even know this is not story unfolding gone all these things out in this great big scene he will bring a young man who simply wanted to build a marriage for Jesus Christ and young lady who had similar desires and bring us together and house to meet there on a little sacred place in the hills of control okay but part of my point saying all that is that if you will stop and think down through your entire life all your journey even your natural journey leading up to Christianity and then from there throughout if you meditate on that you will find Christ in that I believe if you really look you'll find price leading along all through your life but people you come into contact with all your influences in your life your parents and how they raised you and everything about it I believe you'll see Jesus Christ in one more symbology one more little symbol about curve sitting on that rock where she was when we met was the fact that Jesus said that he who hears my sayings and does them all I can do to a man I'm Gavin Wilson more often and not only that but it says in the loop Jesus said that he would take down you know that the man who who hears my sayings and does them I like them to man who builds house upon the rock can you dig down you need to find your salvation you dig to find that rock to build a foundation on crime that takes bigotech searching it takes praying and seeking God and all those things and that's what she does she listen to this Bible ministry here at this church every you know week night from I'll leave at 10 o'clock at night girl works she sits up to midnight and listens to sermons of you ministers here brother for the life of the devil event the release of of the bottle over and over over trying to dig to build a foundation right this is for working out her salvation okay and that was representing the entire on a farm girl and that broth then there was a situation that came up it's not you know about some of you don't I'm not going to give you all the details about it but right after our meeting this is the this is told you last week about the same symbology of the rocks and the trees and all with crosses on either side of those rocks representing that same that same thing that keeps repeating in our marriage over and over and over again the trees on either side of these rocks of Revelation of Christ's cross represented in the diamonds and in our lives consecrated but there was a situation came up dealing with doctrine right after we had got engaged before my engagement that was I thought everything was ironed out and then and yet there was still something that came up that storm they left on turn or whatever you want to say that we thought everything was smooth we had a great battle to go through several months leading up to our engagement and that bothered me for years because I had frayed and I thought thought I thought I had done everything exactly right and yet there was still heresies among us then I thought well how can that be for one thing when you go outside of this church you don't recognize how sheltered we are here because our pastor combats those false doctrines and it warns us against those things outside of this church that's just message 101 just not being off the River Jordan and the sea dog then you come on the literal seed in your natural body when you're born okay the fact that this comes to life those doctrines outside of this church are like the Trinity doctrine in the Baptist Church I never even thought twice about trinitarianism about this church it never even crossed my mind that it might be wrong because it's just Baptist 101 or Christianity 101 it's the basics and you leave this if you go outside this church so I mean those other churches they don't talk all the time about us not being God or about to come with a seed in you because it is the basic system like MasterCard is accepted wherever you go it's just there then nobody even stops and said where could this be right but we are privileged and blessed but only saying at the same time you have to be careful because you can sit here and just catch the vote with your pastor and say I believe what you're saying I want to start with you you've fought out these false doctrines and I'm going to start with you if you go I'm going but that's not that Wagner and I stay here for 5 years with that mindset I needed heresies I needed some dispute with doctoring to come up before my face to me to recognize because then I'm sort of searching men are really look Gavin I email folks back before for many months for months there are engagement trying to decide you know which way to go what is the truth and it was good for her too because she was sort of coming from that background and didn't even know it and Harold was right in the middle of the church that's teaching the truth and still wasn't really walking into it don't understand what I'm saying means I was blinded what's an interception now say about this whole incident I told you about this thing keeps repeating over and over in all the examples but recently our four year old who's now five EULA had two dreams okay I'm not a prophet on an interpreter of dreams but these were pretty clear pretty obvious to me that this was from the Lord and you know I'm not saying to brag but I know that when God when you do something the Lord Loxley likes the contacts on the back like you do what's your kids one of my kids does right I like to pat on the back so that's good version and it really good you're not proud of and sometimes when you're walking in the will of the Lord you don't expect that but yet God gives you these blessings we had our four year old at the time - before you look came up together one morning told her this dream you have you said you might want to hear this Ryan and I went to separate up to a third part I went to you than I listened to her dream and then I went back to Gabby and I asked her because you know a four-year-old changed the story you know they might make up stuff as they go and it counts the ones who told her yeah I've been what she told me was exactly right exactly the dream together so then I took her side and I put her in our room in our recorded it on video so three different accounts that she gave of that dream and all three of them cannot be the same thing so I know she what changed she went she said in my dream I saw God and I said you mean Jesus and she said yeah and she even explained to me what he looked like and even to the color of skin and the length repair and everything just like the Hoffman Enterprise and she said and I said what were we doing in the dream and she said well all her family went up to the front yard to play and her sister we're gonna go play me again we went up there at watch them and she said God was out there and there were two trees and in reality I only had one tree in the front yard okay and her dream she said there were two trees and she said God Jesus took a bed and tied it up between the trees and I said you mean like a hammock and she said like no but she doesn't know she's four she doesn't know what he just said God took a bed and tied it up between these two trees and then he climb upon it laid down to rest and I thought that's silly because God doesn't need to sleep but dreams are an symbology brightening dreams or symbols or something so he climbed up on the bed and he crested he got up from that she said the untie despair he walked over to me and talked with me and I said well where was farming and she said she was staying at your side so what's interesting about all of that is that when we do our daily reading and are praying and are studying in our home and my wife together with we're having a meeting with the Lord and exactly that's what happened is what's happening this crisis coming in dealing with me and with Gaby and it's like some minister pointed out there's trickle down economy of God right you have Christ as the head of the man who's ahead of the line and you know when he reveals something to me I always take it first to my wife and then she will break it down to the kids she's the pastor of our little flock and she will break it down in the way that they can understand so it's like this trickle down economy today and it's a family unit that can receive revelation from Jesus Christ and that's what I wanted to establish in the first place and furthermore say the trees represent me and Gabi and him resting in our marriage you know a place of rest and that's what we were trying to build with him the whole time the second dream about a month later she said that this time God came into her home she said he knocked at the door and said mommy went to answer the door and to me that was kind of strange I thought I should be the one to let him in with a home but really she does that because she gets the patcher of the home she's always when I'm gone driving the truck fifteen hours a day she's at home with the kids and she's pastoring our kids a little flock and so she lets Christ in the moment all those things are just symbols just to show you that that God is pleased with that type of a scenario I know it not everybody here or about you hear the tape has a believing spouse and that you're not able to do that you seek God in every single facet of your life whatever you can do and your public vows will be sanctified by you and your life but if you're if you have this available just don't neglect it I'm saying it if you both believe maybe can both come in and Entering together and have communion with Christ it's not to take place of private time with God you should still have that but then also included in your marriage and your child raising and your all these other things your job everything but every little facet of your life for Christ in it okay well the way that's probably our reason to pray without ceasing I always have a prayerful attitude have gone on your mind all the confident at work at school at church at home everywhere you go and with every relationship put Christ in it somewhere okay interesting thing about boys and Christina was start there to kind of back me up on this but we went to their home couple weekends ago and I'm interested in your story I'd like to know how God works in your life okay and so I went to we went to voices and Christina's wrong just to fellowship but one of the things I want to do was find out their story because I see the same thing in them that we have you know they have a marriage established for Jesus Christ and I wanted to find out exactly how God brought them together and it's very interesting how God brought a Filipino girl up to Canada and then I think she said it's rural through well surreal another cousin one I'm coming down to a meeting the brother Louise was preaching for a minute or interpreting a yeah and they met and released upon their first encounter the crossbar and something spoke to him and said this could be your wife and he turned and looked at her and I believe it's the same one that spoke to me and said you need to get to know that girl one woman who got it first had offered him a in Lawrenceburg man said you need to get done that girl this is how God works and Christine thought she was gonna she was in college to think at the time and she called herself a little nerd little chemistry nerd not having any idea about thinking about when I'm getting married being some men's little humble housewife you know God changes our plans sometimes they don't appreciate keep saying now the title for lesson today that's all background totally up to something a lot of women from them where is the place of my rest Isaiah 66 thus saith the Lord the heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool dude where does the house that you build up to me and where is the place of my rest for all those things have my hands made and all those things have been safe the Lord but for this man will I look even to him that is formed and of a contrast spirit and trembling that my work poor means like humble not necessarily professed British through this poor contrite spirit meaning like you're willing to admit that you're wrong you're always having a penitent heart draws that's not a forgive you and guide you and keep you on the right way and tremble it our about this definition this is my own definition reverent and esteemed highly because saying why do we need this it's not exactly trembling at the word of God if your mindset you come like throw the devil talks about people saying why do we make this everything that in this is pertaining to Jesus Christ is needful we need to learn as much as we can and God knows every bit of it he's you know it's him working through the powerful minister bringing us what we need so it's relevant and that's to make Trembley anywhere you take over a reverent mindset toward an attitude for it the objective is to understand how to prepare a place of rest to catch the headstone this whole entire lesson is about the capstone the headstone and basically again I'm talking about putting God in every facet of your life you're a personal quiet on your marriage and family your job in every way that you can always pray without ceasing and have enough a prayerful attitude and always have a ward on your mind where the ground said the bride is living below her privileges there aren't familiar with that quote he said it should be soaring the skies of God's great pleasure and power and this is how it works I think there are too many untapped unrealized resources in our lives that's what I'm talking about the meditation is left undone we simply read and pray and can come to church but there's got to be meditation they've got to be a thoughtful attitude about what you're reading keep thinking about what your what you're hearing great include him in your marriage and then your family as I said my brother white just things that we recently have a couch to encode you know we're about to cows we need to do a lot of cutting do you keep thinking over and over and over again what's being brought and listen to our sermons from this church over and over again Matthew 8:20 and jesus saith unto Him the foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head look a teammate I tell you that he will have been some speedy nevertheless when the Son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth he's looking for a place he's looking for a bride to make you know we have to make ourselves available in every way that we can that's what I'm talking about your perfect man now dog or the Bible said here that steam is focus almond building temple and the most popular bread pan for heaven is my throne curve this my footstool and where is the place of my rest but a body I stop repair me and then there you are veteran all right this is a continuation from that a body has not prepared me God dwells in the stature of a man reflecting himself into that beings perfect worship I love that because to me that's not the anointing running the island than that that's anointed to and that's worship and so forth but perfect worship is what he's probably undergone in a man that's what he wants but he wants to dwell in someone he's probably found a place of rest so God in us being his tabernacle God manifesting all houses down that he would almost suffocating here from anything he knows about our Sunday school notice that God has always at all time reflected himself in man world down here capstone of Philippians 4:8 oh that's right if you reflux for a it winds up saying it for being a virtue if there be any praise right praise the top of the pyramid that you know one that's coming back into one one is immunity which Jesus Christ okay capstone which is love worship Him in spirit and in truth so I'll ask you three questions what or who is the headstone is it time to receive the headstone and how do we receive that stone so these first couple of questions basically are just about me convincing you that number one of who he is or who that's the steps on it and then is it time because if you don't even know what it is if we're going to see Patrick and if you don't think it's time if you think it's for another age within like what you don't see but if you you're convinced that of who he is and that he's here your bigger than concern my brother man talk about you I'm trying to convince you so you be more concerned okay and then how they feel so first question is what or who is the headstone found about one quote for that the sentence with Daniel that big stone come by and picked it up that big magnet stone you just talk about being some kind of factory I think watched all this the big man come by picked it all up because it's magnetized to it we've got to be magnetized to that headstone that that stone is the Holy Ghost Christ okay and every one of us that's not that magnetism of the Holy Spirit when that storm strikes the image the church will flee into flee to it back into glory shall be taken up at the rapture pressure it up the same once you go forth through that day the second question is is it time to receive the headstone the seventh wicked angle how about that Gentile church is in the Laodicean end of the way of saying if the Jews are in their homeland already there the Gentile apostasy which is like a rejection you know has already taken place and a lot of rejection within the message even though and we have a president like we have we have a nation that broke up like we have we have atomic bombs hanging in the hairs where the church is lukewarm and church people that pull their self together we have history the patterns and there should be no surprise for two pets the stolen when he comes what's left to happen it might be at any minute there is nothing else left or at the end time I don't know whether I'm going to be able to get into that gym early or not but I just want to get part of it too you know something's gonna be really small what does I got 50 slides and I'm trying not to have 100 you know I'm trying to put them all in in one slide as much as I can so I'm sorry you can't seal all right so I wrote down here I know sometimes I can't really fall well you think they know we wrote my notes but there's not this is one brother Wade had made reference to and Sunday evening this past Sunday remember he listed a whole bunch of sermons and pointed out the things of brother Penn's ministry and the progression and is this the sign of the insert okay is this the mystery of the thunders that will bring back the headstone you know I never break Munster brother way from the South he's actually asking a questions love you and always thought it was just trying to get our attention you know they're saying is this the time the answer and then going on to say something about but around the east and another place release another question you guys did a lot of question in these rooms trying to get our attention he's doing like these people in this book for you know ask them questions trying to figure out this could this really be a lot of it could this really be Jesus are they really here have they really come is this the mystery of the thunders that will bring back the headstone you know the pyramid never was capped the headstones yet to come it's been resented could it be brothers and sisters or that the third pole they told me three or four years ago the first boy remember what happened I tried to explain so don't do that second force they don't try and I fooled anyhow do you remember and then he said now there's a third pole coming but don't try to explain to see how I approached this his approach was humbled the contrite heart he was trying to really speak them to know and that's how I approach ought to be I don't know but I feel duty-bound through my church just say something you draw your own conclusion it's do it before my register that's perfect you know because most ministers today what would say well I want to know so he was seeking and I'm saying search for a mentor change trip that book chapter five one is on seeking the Lord and the Holy Spirit so much bigger life in erotic an aggressive temper right his spirit gave them a message for the church I want to bring it to you it has to do with the word and the bride so there's a law reproduction and so forth Steve reform efforts time the very same law applies to the church today whatever she'd started the church will come form LC composite is the same seat and these last days the true bride Church prophecy will come to the headstone and she will be the super Church of super racin as she nears hammer day and the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image this is in order to be united with him there will be one they will be the very manifestation of a word of the Living God nominations cannot produce this long see that's right I'm still on the question of how do we OH still in the question of is it time to receive this headstone [Applause] yep there's a man who's on the line when I'm adding up whatever that is boundary and is making the valleys got a certain Tomlin has to put into it said his no importance iron his brass and steel and most people on down here and that's what Jesus has done by his bride he had to put so much Luther so much Methodist and so much Presbyterian so much Pentecost in it but what does he come up with his own reflection what isn't just like pyramid message you see it's evening right up this coming into coming to them on the way through when they hit stone or with the headstone the Ministry of Jesus props on earth has to be the same as the mastery he had where he can't come to it just like the head to the feet it's not the head but the head packs the feet or makes the feet tell you where to go and get it it's the life of son the son of this time now I've left the Pentecostal aid we're coming to where like in the pyramid not pyramid Bachmann now but I mean like as the pyramid the headstone when it comes to fit it's got to be home there's got to be a minister in the church the true Church of the Living God to where when the headstone comes Christ for the Ministry of Christ and Christ will fit right in together perfectly then that brings back to the demon to take the whole house and go to Gloria the Methodist Baptist Presbyterian through the brave Reformation pages that come out and gave their lives and persecutions my god but that storm is coming yes sir it certainly will come God will send it it'll fit all the buildings together upon giving this is a continuation of that one now we see these signs as we see the ministry from Christ beginning to narrow up mountain to the complete Ministry of Christ you know the pyramid any pyramid narrows as you get closer to the top and the fullness of the Holy Spirit remember the way boredom I'm preaching them Sunday morning from weeks ago we talked about fullness always for translation under Luther it was the same Holy Spirit education the same professional Wesley the messages then the bathroom the Holy Spirit making free trade on pre-stress the grace but for his stations on my product Abraham's covenant confirm that's right trying to cut them down and bring them to a spot to where when the bread capstone comes the ministry that's in the church and the capstone just come right straight together like a magnet make a seal writing together old God comes down to be up it'll be there don't worry it'll be there it would be there so let's just get ourselves to meet that nice comment cornerstone okay I'll get into the foundation let us love and project our lives in Christ and be sincere and stay with the work until when he comes we just fit right him back in like the glove over the hand like that what Sam oh that's the church that God's waiting for him--it thanks though the question then was is a time to reserve a headstone and he is a he's waiting for us so now how do we receive the headstone that's what the whole rest of this is about on another 800 Wow how that happened sorry I think I'll skip over a couple of these just say it's a man full of virtue of their error so when you surrender your complete beating then the Holy Spirit does forms through you and these virtues then you're living tabernacle when a manner when a man or a woman goes us these then the capstone comes down and still stemming at the camp by God which is there we go I want to just get right to the last few slides here you can bargain with bobbin no no I don't want anything it's hot given its time folks I'll tell set you don't turn who is this that's what we've got to do is make a decision what we'll do with it it's here you say how will I be able to just understand things that I don't know nothing about just say to make themself man be born again he cannot understand any of it tell you what this will be up on the internet just quickly for the building back up got him a copy of it upstairs did you want to go through this slide yourself that's not real people time up there kids actually 1022 10:00 a.m. or p.m. yep imagine I remember if you want to go 2 p.m. you the produce has to be in there before the capstone will even kind of on it they what rate the let 327 kids ever get there conservative so speaking in tongues don't mean you're of God working of miracles don't prove your car that's the thing the fruits of the spirit that proves that you're in shock when you see that life sealed away by the Holy Ghost God let it be let that be us if we've done sin - hello Father forgive us Sangster another way was making reference to a while back but that be so now brethren seriously think if it is then the pyramid is kept by the seven thunders metric do you remember the period message it's the capstone let me to do Holy Spirit have something to seal it with the when we added our faith by suggesting dogmas new faith and so forth keep adding it till we get to we got those seven things the seventh one was love which is God that's how he makes the individual and catch himself same with the Holy Spirit then if that be so he's got seven jerk edges that's had seven mystery that's been sounded way and they fought for to bring back and now the head stomp bones to cap off the church those the thunders main that my brother serves is that where we're at how much skip to and warm enough for Medicaid first medication medication hi this is something that let's skip down the underlined part I'm sick so he goes out the wood space takes the piano player is gonna go squirrel hunting and instead he sits over hit the tree and he started meditating and I'm sitting up against a tree somewhere sounds like brother Bell hands up in the air saying Lord what can I do today what will you give me for your children then when I strike something that seems to burnt down come something like this when this presents gets me I beginning to hear something welcome this is something in the sword to talk to 84 closer to come to 84 to two equals four seven to eight before but better are your piece of pestering on like that accredits is coming in you really think he's talking about multiplication I mean I don't think he's talking about math really but I think he's talking about I may be wrong but the basic things that you were seeing in Revelation we gon give you something start thinking on that and he was thinking on that good steward of that and then he'll coming out more to it Bank on these things the things you already know if God I think on those things right and then that's how these floodgates only we're making that chicken trouble a lot of time that's how it starts that's where you find meditation it starts off from editing your mind around gone out of the world away from the world out of the women to yourself some time to come to the sponsor of a certain spot then it stops for together and just rest down a little boogie seven saying great things not six but this I say he was so
