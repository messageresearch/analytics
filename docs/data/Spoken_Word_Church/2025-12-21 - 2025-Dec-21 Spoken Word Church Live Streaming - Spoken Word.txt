========================================

Hallelujah. Dal. Hey you little Heat. Heat. His ways are past finding out, aren't they? Wonderful Lord. How sweet it is to trust him. &gt;&gt; I'm just sure you've had a wonderful time tonight. Just opening the door there a few moments ago and hearing Sister Gertie sing that old song, Keep Holding On. Just one more hour. It brought back memories of a my little church when it just before I left the other time to go into the fields of mission work. I'm looking out at a seek God first here in front across this old beam. I remember Sandy Davidson painted that on there about 25 years ago. On the other side, I think it's got where will you spend eternity? Think right here was uh a woman at the well. Daniel in the lines. Oh my. Many things has happened since then. Just about 5:00 this afternoon, I got emergency call to come about 30, 40 miles down the country here of a dying woman and a very precious friend, Georgie Carter's mother. And I knew there was plenty ministers sure to hold till I got back. Edith has been very bad, too. And while we were there, the Lord God moved on the scene. Sister Carter is a long ways from dying. So, so we're grateful for that. &gt;&gt; And now it's getting time for communion service pretty soon. I think it's about 12:00 when they go to What time have you designated to give it? &gt;&gt; Any time beginning now after this at 11:30? &gt;&gt; Just any time. We How many is to take communion tonight? Let's see your hands. Let's Oh, that's wonderful. All right. I want to speak just a word or two. Maybe I'll lay my watch out here for about 10 minutes, 15. We'll start communion now. Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I know you've had a great time, haven't you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, if you're a brother Thomas kids and sister kids &gt;&gt; all the way down from Ohio, I guess he been up. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's fine. I hope it's on tape and I'll get it. you know, they don't give up. They're just a few days under a hundred. But um but uh that's what keeps me courageous to see people like that. Think I'm an old man and before I was born, they was preaching the gospel. &gt;&gt; And then here I am an old man and they if they can't get out and make their voice ring out, they just take a tape recorder and go from hospital to hospital, house to house preaching the gospel. That's mighty fine. Amen. And I'm sure happy for them and for all those who's anticipated and this the services here and now remember we'll announce it now the Lord willing just as soon as the church is finished which they claim will be about the 10th of February while we're the Lord willing we want to take at least eight or 10 or days or maybe two weeks on those seven seals of revelations And uh we'll send out cards to visiting people from around from home here and let them know uh plenty time ahead. So if they take a notion to come, well, we sure be glad to have you here. And maybe the Lord will give us another display of his presence like he did the last time when we got through the seven church ages. You ever want to pray for somebody? Why? Remember me all the time because I'm one who really needs it. Now, I'm kind of ashamed myself to take up these 10, 15 minutes here to say a little something before we start, &gt;&gt; but let's bow our heads just a moment. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; oh, the battle will be over someday, &gt;&gt; and there will be no more sick to be prayed for, and there will be no more sinners to repent. But Father, while this day is what it is, let us work while we have light to work in. For the hour cometh when no man can work. Now for just a few moments, Lord, I'd feel bad if I did I closed off this year without saying a few more words. Help me, Father. I pray and I might say something that would plain courage in the heart of thy people that we could leave here tonight after taking the communion and we realize that in the communion there is strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Israel took the communion first down in Egypt and walk 40 years without their shoes wearing out or their clothes getting threadbear. And out of two million people, there wasn't a feeble one among them when they come out of the wilderness. Lord, let us remember that tonight as we approach this great hour in Jesus name we pray. Amen. If I should speak the context that I had wrote down that I was going to start on this afternoon, we'd be here at 5:00 in the morning. But I want to read just a word &gt;&gt; from &gt;&gt; Thank you from Ephesians the 6th chapter 12th verse. And just for a few moments now that for courage. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against rulers of darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Spiritual wickedness in high places. And I'd like to draw from that a little uh 10 or 15 minutes context or text rather. I want to call it the contest. A contest is a test of strength. And we um where we have the uh test strength. We used to have the idian used to put a fire and they would put so many men on this end of the rope and so many on this end and the the tug of war, the contest of strength would pull the losing party across the fire. And now uh we know there's many things and we could base this up on for a few minutes of of contest, but I want to speak for these minutes quickly upon the greatest contest there is that's between the church and Satan. That great strength of Satan. And we want to speak of the great strength of God in his church now. This great contest has been going on for many years. It started in heaven and Satan was kicked out into the earth and then he become a enemy to God's people. And since then, he's used all of his strength and his strategy to try to pull God's people across the fires or into his fires. And we know that who has the most power, God does. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God, when he gave his people, the best thing that he could to combat Satan with was his word. Now because the word is God and who's stronger than God? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the word is God and the word becomes our strength. God in the church becomes his strength to pull Satan to his own fires. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That he has made. And the tug goes on. Now, Jesus said in Mark 16, "In my name, they shall cast out devils." Now, I know that's an old uh uh saying that people or there is an old saying that and it's not so old either. People don't believe in demons in this day. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; But the thing to do to my opinion is know your enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. and and know your enemy and train uh for the contest that you're going to have when you meet him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you're going to meet him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And know him. Know his know what his strength is and then train for this contest when you do meet him or it's one thing sure you're going to meet him. And so you train for the contest. Now training for a contest is just like a boxer. His uh his uh enemy that he's going to meet out there in a contest to fight. A real good fighter usually knows and studies his opponent, studies his licks, knows where he fights far, whether he leans forward, hangs back, fights right-handed or left-handed. He studies all this. And then if he's a good, smart fighter, he gets him a sparring partner that'll fight just like his opponent fights. for he'll know all of his licks when he gets to that place. And I think that's a very good thing for Christians to do. &gt;&gt; That's right. And now, if you want to start training, start with John 3:16, the golden rule. Start right out with that. And that'll get you on the floor and then train for the for the knockout punches because you're going to have to use them. Everybody knows that you have to train to hit your enemy. And always God uses his word. We must remember that God uses his word to defeat his enemy. If God could think or could have give his people anything better to defeat the enemy with, he would have done it. So, as I've always said, when God makes a decision, that's the best that there is. He never has to alter his decisions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the first decision God gave his people in the Garden of Eden to combat the enemy was his word. They were fortified with his word. And now the enemy is going to study the art of strategy with the word. And now Satan studied that all out so perfectly that when he come to Eve, he had the the best of strategy he could use upon her. And that was to reason with the word. Now, you never want to reason with God's word. Just believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't try to explain it. Don't try to figure it out. Now, you cannot figure out God. So God is the word and it's just made to believe &gt;&gt; and that's our strength. Just accept the word and anyone knows that a seed in the right kind of ground will produce its kind. And we just take the word and now Eve began to stop to reason when he she quoted the word to him and God said you should not eat thereof for the day you eat thereof that day we die. And Satan never disagreed with her. He said, "Certainly, that's right." But he said, "You see, you need some new light, something a little different from what God said. And if you do do it, you'll be just a little smarter. Your eyes will be open." But she said, "Well, God said we would die." He said, "Oh, surely." See, there you come. &gt;&gt; Just that much. Surely you won't die, but God said you would. And that settles it. And that that brought that great &gt;&gt; tug of war then and pulled the whole human race into death &gt;&gt; because Eve listened to a reasoning against God's word. Now it's a shame that she did it, but it's done past. But now we're still fortified. And that link was made up in Christ Jesus. We know that God gave us our best defense just simply to trust his word. You know, and many say today that there is no such a thing as a devil. Uh they believe that it's just simply a thought. They believe that and there's people that believe that that if the Holy Spirit is a good thought and the devil is a bad thought. But if you notice when the Bible speaks of the Holy Spirit, he said when he the Holy Spirit has come and he's a personal pronoun. See, so he he is a person and the devil is a person and demons are persons. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, they are demons and they they come in many ways, but they think it's an oldfashioned idea. The man was arguing me here a few weeks ago. He said, "You know what you do? You just set those people's mind to thinking something when you uh uh tell them that thing. It's just a change of thought. I met that very same thing in India one time when those holy men there where we had I believe the largest audience I ever spoke to and one standing audience been a half million people. And I caught it by discernment in the spirit. And um they would see the Holy Spirit call people and call them out in to the audiences and tell different things and catching their thought. The Ray Jaws and the Holy Man, they said he's reading their mind. So a few moments about five or six had passed through the prayer line and a blind man come through and he was totally blind and his eyes were as white as my shirt. And I said, "Now here is a blind man. Anyone can see he's blind." And I said, "If I could help him, I would do so. But the only way I could do would be by a gift to maybe say something that he has done and that would give thought that if God know what he has done he certainly will know what he's going to do. So I said now looking at him I said now he's a worshipper of the sun. He's been blind 20 years and when the interpreter said it that was right. I said he's a married man. He his wife is rather small and he has two sons. One about 719. That was exactly right. Call their names what it was. Then out in the audience in the place where the people were there come that wave in its mental. It's um something on the order of of a psychic reading of their mind. that I thought, Lord, if you'll just help me, I I need your help, Lord. These people are trying to classes of telepathy, and it's not. And you know it, Lord. And yet, I'd given the scripture that's Jesus said he did nothing till the father showed him. And then turning to look at the man again, I saw him just above there in a vision with just as good eyes as I have. I thought, now is the time. I said, this man is a worshshiper of the sun. Now, and he's gone blind. I said, now the there's the Mohamadan priest and there's the the priest of the six chains and the different types of religion, Buddha. Now this man wants to receive his sight. Now you would say that he ex he he worshiped the creation instead of the creator. I believe that too. But here we sat tonight. I said and we've been today I was entertained in the James Temple where 17 different religions was there to interview me and every one of them against Christ. Every one. And I said now and many of you man was down there. Now if Christ is so wrong then this man wants to be right and surely the God of creation who made the world will be the only one who can give him his sight. That's reasonable. And I said now if any of you people the Mohamadan here is the leading religion. If the Mohamadan priest will come here and give him his sight then I'll follow or if the Buddha priest will come give him his sign. &gt;&gt; But let the God who made him, the God, somebody's God somewhere, &gt;&gt; cuz there has to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can't have a creation without a creator. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it'll take a creator to create sight in these eyes. He'd been blind 20 years from looking at the sun, thinking he'd go to heaven if he didn't. A man ignorantly done that. I said, "What would you Buddha priest do? You just change his way of thinking. You'd say he's wrong. They worship their dead ancestors. Now I said, now uh you'd think he was you'd say he was wrong, but what would you do? You change his way of thinking. Now I said, what would the Mohamadan do? Change his way of thinking. The six genes and so forth change your way of thinking. I said, we had the same thing in the United States. The Methodists all want to make all the Baptists become Methodists and the Pentecostal wants to take all the Methodists and make them Pentecostals. It's a change of thought. &gt;&gt; But that's not what we're talking about. &gt;&gt; We're talking about God, the creator. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I said, surely the creator would speak and I wouldn't have said that if that vision hadn't been there by no means. Now I said, "Now if the one that let him be God, come give him his sight." Now I said, "Now I challenge any priest or Rachel or holy man or any what it might be, come give him his sight and I'll follow your philosophy. You've made a convert." That the quietest bunch of people I ever heard. &gt;&gt; Nobody did it. I said, "What you so quiet about?" I said, "The reason you are is because you can't do it." and neither can I. But the God of heaven who raised up his son Jesus Christ whose servant we are has just showed me a vision that the man's going to receive his sight. &gt;&gt; I said now if that be not so then you could order me out of India. But if it is so every one of you owe your life to Jesus Christ. I would like to ask you, how many in here will give your life to Christ if this blind man receives his sight? You see your priest? Nobody comes up here. Why don't they come? If they've told you the religion is so big and so great, &gt;&gt; why don't somebody come and say something? Nobody come. I said, then you people out there, if you see this blind man standing here and I've come a doctor to examine his eyes, he shook his head. He said, "He's blind." And so I said, "Certainly, he's blind." But I said, "If if God gives him his sight, how many of you will serve Jesus Christ and just as far as I could see of oceans of black hands turned to the man and said, "Lord Jesus, let it be known that thou art God." The man grabbed me around the neck and there set the mayor of Bombay sitting there. Grabbed him around next to see as good as anybody could. What is it? It's uh it's actually a power. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Satan is Satan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you don't believe in a devil, when I first got started, I I run headlong into him every day. Don't tell me there's no devil because I know better. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have to fight with him every day. &gt;&gt; So, I know there is a devil &gt;&gt; and you must be trained. What do you believe? Amen. &gt;&gt; Not trained in psychology, not trained in education, &gt;&gt; but trained by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God's power in his word to make it manifest. &gt;&gt; Know your enemy. Oh, what a cruel thing he is. How I would like to stand here now and lay on to that. Go back to the Bible. Show your man back there who come face to face with how in the contest against the enemy they fortified themselves by the word of God. Noah had an experience of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he knew that God told him was going to rain. And the contest was on between science and the word of God. Science says it can't happen. And God said it will happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That same thing exists today. &gt;&gt; It will happen. &gt;&gt; It does happen. &gt;&gt; There is devils. &gt;&gt; But Jesus cast them out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he gave his church authority to do so. &gt;&gt; Cast out devils in my name. He cast seven devils out of a pretty woman one day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said, "When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walks in dry places, returning back then, bringing seven other devils with him." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, that goes to show that if the man was cleaned of devils, there was something was in him that had gone out. &gt;&gt; A devil had gone out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. out. When the devil moved out, that God gives God an opportunity to move in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, and when he goes out, let the Holy Spirit come in. Don't just leave it there. If you do, just repent of your sins and go on. &gt;&gt; Then you're going to be worse off than ever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But get that place where Satan once lived and occupied. Get it filled with the Holy Spirit of God and then you'll have the strength of God's word in you manifested and &gt;&gt; cast out devils. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Contest is on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The evening lights are shining. &gt;&gt; God's Holy Spirit is present. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And now it's just about about 3 minutes until the time that the whistles are going to be blowing and it will be midnight. And then as we leave this building to go to our different places and our homes and to meet outside &gt;&gt; and to meet the world. &gt;&gt; Let's not go as we have in former times. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go in the power of his resurrection. Let's go in the name of Jesus Christ with the banner lifted high and with faith in his word, the handle the two sword with the shield and the full armor of God on to beat the enemy because he's getting stronger and more powerful every day. As a as the enemy comes in like a flood, the spirit of God raises up a standard against him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If we have come to the end of these things that we and the mysteries of God has been completed with us, we are looking for more strength, a rapture strength to be a diverse force that'll rapture the church and take it in the glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We must have it. &gt;&gt; Let's meet 63 with a challenge. &gt;&gt; We are the servants of the living God. &gt;&gt; I'm like Shadrach, Mach, and Abednego of all will not bow to the devils &gt;&gt; of this world. &gt;&gt; And take back this thing that what we've talked about. But let's press the battle. &gt;&gt; Amen. feel tonight as we're listening for them whistles. Something like David did that dreadful hot night when he laid out there under them malberry bushes and the enemies a routing. What an hour it must have been for David. What a time for him laying there. He didn't know how to move. He didn't know what to go by because he knowed he was outnumbered. But all at once he heard the sound of a wind going through the top of the bushes. He knowed God went on before him &gt;&gt; and he went to the battle. I feel something like that tonight after last night's message. &gt;&gt; I'm laying in the darkest hour that I ever faced in my life. &gt;&gt; I feel like Isaiah at the temple after seeing those angels. I'm a man of unclean lips and dwelling among people with unclean lips. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen, I I've got to meet it somewhere. &gt;&gt; And the only thing I'm waiting to hear that rushing through the malberry bushes &gt;&gt; to go to meet the enemy wherever it is. &gt;&gt; God help us to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And now I think it's 1 minute until 12:00 and uh 62 with all of its uh pass. Let's let it be passed. Let us stand to our feet now. Hallelujah. Each and every one of us &gt;&gt; the context is on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Each one of you. Paul said, "Forgetting those things that are in the past, &gt;&gt; the all our mistakes of last year, I press towards the mark of the high calling." &gt;&gt; All my mistakes that I made in all these years, forgive me for them. &gt;&gt; God, forgive me. Church, forgive me. And the ministry that I I fail with, I feel God, forgive me for it, church, forgive me my mistakes. Now press towards the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus. Whatever tomorrow holds, I don't know, but I know who holds. 1963. Let us raise our hands to God now. And let us pray in our own way as we make our confessions and ask God to help us through this next coming year. Heavenly Father, as we stand here, as many thoughts is dying out in our hearts and of the mistakes of last year and as we are approaching the death of 62 and the birth of 63. Oh God, may we be one step higher up the ladder until we can see Jesus and his program. May everyone here, Lord, in prayer while the old year's dying and the new birth of the new year is coming in. May the old man's sin and unbelief die out in our hearts and the new birth come in with the 1963 like a Russian mighty wind that might fill our bees and make us new creatures in Christ. Make us fit servants. Forgive our past. Bless our future. Guide us, oh Lord God, with thy mighty hand, Jehovah. Bless these ministers here. Bless all the leoty, all the visitors. Be thou with us, Lord. We are your servants and we give ourselves holy to you for 1963 that the power of your spirit might have more primaces. Good morning. God bless you all. That was a mighty wonderful preaching there. &gt;&gt; I was enjoying it so much. Praise the Lord. All righty. Get this going. God, that's good. Let's bow our heads and um and pray. Dear heavenly father, we're so grateful, Lord, to be alive one more day, to be um to have God's revelation this day, to have your rest, your priest, to have your presence with us, Lord. We're so grateful, Lord, that we can call upon your name. We're so grateful that we can come with anticipation and believe for all things and that we can, Father God, uh, still receive revelation of your word that we can know that we're called in this last age, Father, as your bride, Father, to accomplish your will on this earth, Father, and to believe your word and to rest in your word, to let rest in your promises. And then we're so thankful we have thus say the Lord that we have a sure word of promise and that we have Father such a sure sound of trumpet that we have just such a sure word of prophecy that we have such a a true message this age father that you brought through your prophet prophet. Father we believe it and we just ask u that you enlighten to us this day or your precious words and that you would teach us father more in the revelation of your truth and in your message in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. Praise the Lord. God is good. Praise the Lord. So today I'm on topic of u God's presence. God's presence and I think it'd be uh wonderful to uh to share the scriptures here. I've been God has shown me and it's um it's just a beautiful topic to me. Um I was going to teach on the topic of of believe and um just surely last night the Lord um guided me to to this precious topic. It's I think it's so beautiful right God's God's presence in his presence. So his presence is an expression of his attributes. It we're talking about the sa selfsame presence of the divine being of God. Think about it like when you have a little child or someone come nearest to you and and you just you're in that presence of someone. They're you're perceiving you're expressing that the the attributes the August presence the warmth and and the comfort that comes with being personally with someone. And in Psalm 16:11, I love I love that it says, "Thou wilt show me something that gets demonstrated, revealed that the paths of life, the path of life in thy presence is fullness of joy." That's a joy that is complete, that is full. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's joy. At thy right hand there are pleasures forever more. And I think it's special that we have a God that just doesn't just give a word, doesn't just give a manual and instructions, but he actually comes and indwells the person. He comes and he carries out the the same power, the same um his his being, his presence, right? &gt;&gt; We're thankful for the for his comforter. And in first uh Chronicles 16:27, it actually gives four precious words here uh associating with God's presence. So it's talking about his presence. Glory and honor are in his presence. Strength and gladness are in his place. &gt;&gt; I think about just I I had a little struggle yesterday and all I did is just I yielded to the Lord and affliction, a pain and and just instantly um God's presence came by &gt;&gt; and it it just changes everything. It does give you a strength. It does put a gladness in you and and you experience God's honor and glory, something that's divine and something that no medicine can do in you. &gt;&gt; And to me, it's precious, right? When you're spiritually delivered from your afflictions, when his presence comes, uh fullness of joy comes healing and it brings about the restitution, the restoration of what we need. I think first as as a spirit being, you know, and we're going to do a study uh and get to the good part of his presence, but I just want to touch upon what it is to be away for his pre presence a bit about the also how his enemies, you know, tremble at his presence and are melt at his presence and what that does and also how there's a there's really a reverence and a respect, a trembless and people that are troubled at his presence that comes by and then there's an approach to his presence, you know, and then by God's grace, we have been able to experience the the goodness of his pre presence. &gt;&gt; So, you know, it does it doesn't come by just like that. Of course, there's an approach. And we see in Genesis 3:8 when it first talks about the presence or God's presence and and in this case, and they heard the voice of the Lord and of God walking in the garness in in the gu garden in the cool of the day. And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; See, amongst the tree of the garden. So see, his presence is something to to be sought out for, but it is also something to that kind that can come with the tremble, with the with the with the fear. &gt;&gt; So in Genesis 4:16, we also see Cain went out of the presence of the Lord and dwelt in the land of Nod on the east of Eden. So see, he's went out of the presence. It's interesting to know that at some point he he was actually in or about or around his presence, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because he went out of the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; The Lord spoke to him at some point too, right? &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham speaks in 62 in the message in his presence. It says, "May the Lord bless his word." I think that's the most striking scripture we find that in the presence of God, men recognize themselves to be sinners. See, it's a it's a miracle for us to be able to even uh recognize. I remember when when um I actually for the first time, it kind of sounds like an oxymoron, but believe that I was a sinner, you know, because I was a sinner back then, living in sin. And I remember I had an uncle of mine who would testify and said, you know, um you're living in sin and all that. And and after a while, you know, you the first things you say is like, I'm not a bad person. I don't go robbing banks. I don't go doing that. &gt;&gt; It's amazing how people say the same thing. And I said that I said that right. I justified myself. So I didn't believe I was a sinner. But when I first believed that I was a sinner or or or knew or recognized like it says recognize that you're a sinner, that's a miracle. &gt;&gt; And I think that's when you're God's getting closer to you. You're getting closer to the Lord because that's got to come with his presence. It's got to be a miracle. &gt;&gt; We pray that over our children, right? of our youth that um when they're gone astray that may may God's presence go start working on them and then just bring that conviction &gt;&gt; that's we may feel pretty good when we're um out different places and feel like that we're pretty good people but whenever come into the presence of God then we see how little we are &gt;&gt; then we recognize right that we're sinners so enemies do perish at his presence we know um when mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence. So picture this. It says, "As smoke is driven away, so drive them away. As wax melteth before the fire, they have no they stand no chance, right? Wax stands no chance before the fire. So let the wicked perish at the presence of God, &gt;&gt; you know, and that that's also your your enemies, your foes, you know, the the bad influences, the spirits that battle us." And I just think that God does that sometimes. He does that um to and I'm thankful that he does, right? Because our enemies are are are not flesh and blood. They're spirituals and principalities. &gt;&gt; And we're so thankful that he can do that to our enemies. In Isaiah 64, it says, "As when the melting fire burneth, the fire causes the waters to boil to make thy name known to thy adversaries." &gt;&gt; Makes the name known to them. Can you imagine just them devils and then all of a sudden says I am the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; They must flee. &gt;&gt; Says that the nations may tremble at thy presence. Tremble at this presence. So in here we have this is a pretty interesting question the Lord poses in Jeremiah 5 as a prophecy. He says fear ye not me say the Lord. Will you not tremble at my presence which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by perpetual decree that cannot pass it? You know the the waves cannot actually go over that. And though the waves thereof to toss themselves, they yet they cannot prevail. Can they not prevail? Though they roar, they cannot they can. It says yet they yet can they not pass over it. So I just think the Lord um the Lord's presence is something to be uh you know reverence about because it it's a itself being coming near and manifesting. I I think Job u describes it here well. This is Job speaking for he perforth the the thing that is appointed for me and many such things are with him. It says therefore I am troubled at his presence. &gt;&gt; Right? See, when there's affliction, when there's such, you know, we we recognize when I consider, I'm afraid of him, for God maketh mine heart soft &gt;&gt; and the Almighty troubleth me. &gt;&gt; So, see, take don't take for granted, you know, now that you're a mature Christian and you can come into God's presence. You know, it came because of all of this. &gt;&gt; It came because of the Job experience. It came because, you know, his presence allowed us to recognize that we were sinners. It came with that with with that growth and that progression and his self same presence is him right but the same God will come and separate divide and cause these uh these things to be moved away from our lives you know these costs of battle you know cause the nations to tremble against you know the God of Israel and such the God of Jacob it says in the Bible as well but for you they know it starts then to realize you know but this is who I am think about like God coming in the presence and defending a little child of in front of a bully or something or big brother and you know he basically first comes and and he you know he strikes fear at the and mel like fire burns away you know at his presence and then the little boy goes like now he's afraid of the one that defended him and he basically says like I didn't know you can do that and then now he you know after your heart is soft and and you're troubled at him then then you're in a position to come approach his presence right in respect and reverence &gt;&gt; and then you can experience his sweet fellowship, his august presence, his comfort, all the the good the good benefits of his presence &gt;&gt; that come with the selfexisting one. Right? Psalm 68:8, the earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God. Even Si itself was moved at the presence of God, at the God of Israel. So this is in the natural, right? Tremble thou earth at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob. See that no flesh should glory in his presence. Right. &gt;&gt; I I I can attest to that, right? It's not our flesh, of course, but that glory is in his presence. But boy, our soul, you know, that's been redeemed, regenerated from God. It does. It did say that his presence comes with a glory and an honor and strength and gladness and say uh I like this little section here about just one verse about so fleeing from the presence of a foolish man. So see the fresh the foolish man can also comes with the presence and it says go from the presence of the foolish man when thou perceiveth not in his lips um of it says when thou perceiveth not in his the lips of knowledge &gt;&gt; so that he there's no knowledge as in his le lips the presence of god brings a conviction so that's that's uh one of the message quotes I have here is in his presence the same message in 62 but the random says then we realize how little we are when we realize how great he is and how close we come in of his of coming to his presence. Somehow or another, it's always throwed a great effect upon people to come into the presence of God. I've seen the time in my ministry when you would see the presence of God come into such a place that it would bring a person up and just reveal the life to them, &gt;&gt; right? and call out their sins of all kinds of immoral acts. And it brings such a holy hush amongst the people till they drop out of the prayer line. Look at this illustration. Before they ever come out to be prayed for and run to the altar and get right with God before they come unto his presence. &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing? God's presence was so perfectly there &gt;&gt; next to the prophet when he was um in the uh discernment that the people just feared at his presence. You know, as they came close in the prayer line, can you picture that? They would just go to the they would just go to the altar and make it right first. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Before they came in any much closer to that presence. See, there's something about coming into the presence of God. It causes things to happen. Yes. &gt;&gt; You know, either to the enemy or to the devils or, you know, to ourselves the believer as as we surrender to his presence. &gt;&gt; In Psalm 140 and 13, it says, "Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name, the upright," so it's not talking about the believer, right? "Shall dwell in his presence." I love that word dwell because that word dwell is is it's um it's like uh such a a um trusting word where you can be with someone but dwell means like you're sitting back taking off your shoes like in your house in your living room &gt;&gt; and and you're dwelling and when you're you're just at ease you're you're you're comforting and trusting the in whose presence you're in. Amen. &gt;&gt; I love dwelling. You know, I love like a dwelling your home, right? It's it's it's a dwelling and and that is how we should abide dwell in in God's presence. And this is the verse that we read uh just just a reminder, glory, honor in his are in his presence. Strength and gladness are in his place. Another of the opening scriptures. So, thou shalt show me. And we'll find here with Mary is that when the angel of the Lord um came, he says from the presence of God, he says, "And I will show you things." I just love the revelation of God because it says here, "Thou will show me the path of life." &gt;&gt; He shows us the way that we should go where the life is in. In thy presence is fullness of joy. At thy right hand there are pleasures forever more. &gt;&gt; In this Psalm 17, it says, "Let my sentence or my vindication come from thy presence. Let thine eyes behold the things that are equal. Whether shall I go from thy from thy spirit or whether shall I flee from thy presence? You know, if I go here, you're there. If you go up there, you're there. I just think that once you've been impregnated, right? Once you've been um entrusted with God's presence and and experience God's presence, I believe it we're in there for the long haul because, you know, like I said, God's presence does bring a separation, a division or it does bring a a fight. It does bring a burning that melts the enemies away and it does bring a trembling. It does bring an approach. But, you know, once you go through all that, it does bring that that that rest and that peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, rest in his presence. Here I have. And he said, "My presence shall go with thee." This is to to Moses and I will give thee rest. &gt;&gt; So this a rest as a company as we talked about couple month a month ago on God's rest. So I just love that his presence comes with a rest. Something that you can again lay back, dwell, trust. See look I this verse is very dear because it says in Psalm 31:20, "Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence." So, isn't that amazing? Is thy his presence being a secret place, right? In the secrets of thy presence from the pride of man, thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues. Isn't that a a a comfort comfortable place to be with to know that God hides them in the secret of his presence and from the pride of man and thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues. I say, you know, sometimes I don't take that for granted what it's like just to be um covered, to be shielded uh from uh from a strife of man, from the strife of tongues, from the pride of man. You know, it's don't take it for granted, right? All the things you're that you've been um protected from that you all the comforts in knowing his presence. Cast me not away. Since Psalm 51, you know, it's u created me a new heart, oh Lord. Cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy holy spirit from me. &gt;&gt; That's everybody's prayer here. &gt;&gt; The hills melted like wax at the presence of the Lord at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth. See, in all their affliction, he was afflicted. Look at this. And the angel of his presence saved them. &gt;&gt; In his love, in his pity, he redeemed them. Isaiah, and he bared them and carried them all the days of old. &gt;&gt; All the good things God's presence does for them. &gt;&gt; Just try it one time. It's it's wonderful when you just surrender. And um it does take a it does take an effort, right? You have to go set aside and but boy, when you enter into God's presence through prayer, hearing the the preaching of his word, hearing the message, singing a song, Right? &gt;&gt; Hearing a song that's that's what it's about is just being in contact with your heavenly father. &gt;&gt; The burden of Egypt. See this is talking about the burden of Egypt. Behold the the Lord writeth upon a swift cloud. We have a message. And shall come into Egypt and the idols of Egypt shall be rem removed at his presence. &gt;&gt; This is what his presence does. And the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it. I'm thankful that we have a word and a presence of God that the Lord can ride in a swift cloud and and that can melt away just move all the idols in our life &gt;&gt; and that he can um he can melt the the presence of with our heart the heart of Egypt the heart of the world right get is melted in the &gt;&gt; in the the midst of it. Second Chronicles we have and all the kings of the earth sought the the presence of Solomon. So this is the God's presence in a believer now in someone that who trusts in him to hear the wisdom that God had put in his heart. &gt;&gt; So remember we knew about God's wisdom. I mean Solomon's wisdom but God's presence was with them with him. &gt;&gt; And we're so thankful that we have God's presence in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And a greater than Solomon was here said Jesus. Isn't that amazing? So approaching his presence as we wrap up here in 2 Chronicles it it says and they dwelt therein and have built the sanctuary therein for thy name. So think about the word thy name saying if if when evil cometh. So this is the approach. If when evil cometh upon us as a sword or judgment or pestilence or famine or really bad things we stand before his this house and in thy presence. And it says, "For thy name is thy in thy house in thy presence and cry out unto thee in our affliction. Then thou will hear and help." Isn't that amazing? The approach is it's repentance. You know, it does come through through that approach. Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms, with singing. Amen. Praise the Lord. Serve the Lord with gladness. come before his presence with singing. That's God's approach. &gt;&gt; And and here's the account on Mary. And the angel answering said unto, excuse me, not Mary. And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel that stand in the presence of God, and I'm sent to speak unto thee, and to show thee glad tidings. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is just amazing how there's there's an angel that stand in his presence. And what it does is it reveals as it show glad tidings in in Jude 24 uh to 25 we have now unto him this is the last scripture here. So unto him that is able to keep thee from falling. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. Help us Lord. and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy. &gt;&gt; To the only God our savior, he says, "To you only God our savior, be glory and majesty, dominion and power for now and ever." Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And just as we wrap up here, God's presence um to the believer is something that it really comes with the with the goods. It comes with the it's where we're healed. It's where we're strengthened. It's where we're equipped. &gt;&gt; It's where we um God's word comes alive. It's when the uh you know, it's the it's the evidence that God is is near and with us, that he's he's still along the way encouraging us. And it's a visitation, right? It's a self it's self being ever present. And just to know that the God that created us all, created everything is is able to come and manifest in the believer &gt;&gt; and is able to come. And I love the word August presence because in Spanish the word August means or a gusto. It means that you're very well comfortable. It actually means like you're comfortable, but you're like it's like expressing the the feeling that you get when you're comfortable. It's a it's like think about when you put that nice sweater or the nice coat on and it's just August. It's uh it's amazing how brother Bam taught a lot about the August presence of the Lord and just really um comforting his people, you know, and uh we go through a lot. So, I'm thankful that we have God's presence to u make all things right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, God bless you, brothers. Have a wonderful service. Praise the Lord. Heat. Heat. Heat. Hey. Hey. Hey.

It's good to see everybody here this morning, brother. &gt;&gt; This morning, we're going to be reading from James 5 1-12. And um let's speak to the author before we go to the word. Ready? Fresh heavenly father, we thank you for this day and we ask you Lord to forgive us of our sins. Cleanse us, Lord, and have your way with us. Pour out that form and letter rain through us, Father, that we can manifest that which you have brought to us and laid on our table here at this end time, Father. And we ask, Father God, today that you just bless every ear that's here and every word that spoke come from you, Lord. And reveal it to us, Father. Open our eyes. Let us not be blinded by the things of the world or and Father, we ask now that you'd bless all of those that couldn't make it through the door today, Lord. Be with them and bless them, the ones at home, and bless our family members still out in the world, Father, cuz we know your word. Your word said we'd be here with our offspring. And we believe that, Lord, this time of season, we ask you just to bless each one in a special way. bless our pastor, Lord, as he's preparing to bring the your meal to us today that you've placed upon his heart. And you just be with him, Lord, and come down and use that vessel and bless him, Father, as he speaks to us. And we ask now, Lord Jesus, that you bless the reading of the word and have your way with us. And we ask these things in your name, Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. as we go to the word. Went the wrong way. Sorry. The old Bible don't have the names in it anymore. So, here we go. John five, I mean James 5 1-12. Go to now ye rich men. Weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. Miseries, I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; Your gold and silver is cankered, and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasures together for the last days. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth and been lon. Ye have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter. Be patient, therefore, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husband of man waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience, for it until he receiveth the early and the latter reign. Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest you be condemned. Behold, the judge standeth before the door. &gt;&gt; Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job and have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy. But of all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by earth, neither by any other oath, but let your yay be yay, and your nay be nay, lest ye fall into condemnation. &gt;&gt; Thank you for the opening of the word. You may be seated. this morning. I want to I want to try a song this morning. Uh, I I like this song and uh it's been many years ago I got to sing this song with brother Richard Marlo at the at the nursing home and uh you get to thinking about this time of year. Get thinking about all the ones that have gone on and precious memories and things and God's touched your life. And I heard this song and I love it and just wanted to hear wanted to sing it this morning. It's called It Came Upon a Midnight Clear. That glorious song of old. Amen. It came upon the mid night clear thy glory a song of old from angels bending near the earth to touch their hearts of gold. Peace on the earth good will to men from heaven's all gracious king. The world in silence stillness lay to hear the angels sing. Still through the glowing skies they come with peaceful wings unfur. And still their heavenly music flows for all the weary world. Above it sad and lonely place they bend on our way. And every babble sounds the blessed angels sing. And ye beneath life's crushing blow whose faults are low. to along the blinding way with painful steps and slow. Look now for glad and golden eyes come swiftly on the way. Oh, rest beside the weary robe and hear the angels sing. For low the days I'm facing home, my prophets sing of all. And with the ever circleing years shall come the time for told. And peace shout over all the earth it is anient splenders fling. And the whole world give back the song which now the angels sing. Yet with the woes of sin and strife, the world has suffered long. Many the angels strain have rolled to thousand years of Rome. and man at all. With man here's not the long which they bring. Oh, hush the noise, ye man of strife, and hear the angels sing. Amen. Amen. There was a night when there was angels, that heavenly host came with a message to speak to them peace. Thank God we had a message. &gt;&gt; We've had an angel visitation in our day &gt;&gt; to bring a message of peace to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know that message is still going on today. &gt;&gt; And all you have to do is stop and listen. &gt;&gt; There's still an angel voice speaking. &gt;&gt; Amen. to bring you great tidings of great joy &gt;&gt; that you can receive a king also. &gt;&gt; Not just one that came 2,000 years ago laid in a manger, but he comes to reside in you, take up residence inside you. &gt;&gt; I'll lead you and guide you. &gt;&gt; I'll never leave you. &gt;&gt; I'll be with you, &gt;&gt; even in you to the end of the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; We know that Jesus wasn't born in December. &gt;&gt; But you know what? That message still applies today. &gt;&gt; Every single day, we worship the God of heaven. &gt;&gt; He took on the form of sinful flesh that didn't know any sin that I could become what he is. Amen. &gt;&gt; Today I'm the righteousness of God &gt;&gt; because of his gift. &gt;&gt; And we're supposed to proclaim that to the to the world &gt;&gt; to show the world he still lives today. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Like brother said, don't let ever this message ever get common to you. &gt;&gt; You know, many years ago, the Lord come by my way. It spoke to me. He brought me out of the miry clay. He delivered me from the things of my past. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm sorry. I just &gt;&gt; I think about that. &gt;&gt; What a wonderful gift. You know, we spend so much time talking about people buying gifts and everything. The greatest gift on earth is free. &gt;&gt; And you want the world to see that Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Sister Rebecca, would you like to come this morning? Bless us with a song. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And then uh Sister Bella has one. Sister Zoe has one this morning also. for making the sun to shine. Putting the stars in the sky. For the flowers that bloom, the ocean so blue.

This time we're going to worship the Lord in tithes and offerings. Brother Kon, would you mind helping us this morning? Father, I believe we could join with sister testimony. Thank you, Lord. Father, collectively, Lord, we thank you most importantly for the doors to be open this morning. Come and fellowship around the world, Lord. Father, this will just be a social without your presence. So, we ask in your name, Lord, Father, that you come, we anoint your word, Lord, pray that you use Lord to make this in our hearts. We ask that you give us the right attitude to do so remembering the ti and offerings fatherless pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister Bella. God bless you all. Hope we're all ready for a good service. It's been good so far. Um, I just wanted to piggyback on what brother Emanuel had read. He read 1st Chronicles 16. You know, the glory and honor are in his presence. And R in the King James version in my Bible is italicized. So, it's put with emphasis. Strength and gladness are in his place. And if we skip down to verse 9, you see, give unto the Lord the glory that is due unto his name. Bring an offering and come before him. worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness. So, we've come all with an offering of praise, I would hope. And my goodness, there's such a presence this morning. My hands are just shaking. All right. So, this is a a very well-known song. He brought me out of the myy clay. So, I invite all of you to sing with me cuz we all know the song. You clap your hands. You give him the praise. Okay. My heart was distressed Jehovah's found. And in the pit where my sin dragged me down, I cried to the Lord from the deep f my clay. The tendency brought me out to golden day. He brought me out of the merry way. He set my feet on the rock to say he puts a song in my soul today. A song of praise. Hallelujah. He placed me upon the stone rock by his side. My steps were established. Here I abide. No danger of falling. While here I remain but standing until the crowd I gain. He brought me out of the rain. He sets my feet on the rock to sing. He puts a song in my soul today. A song of praise. Hallelujah. He gave me a song was a new song of praise. By day by night, my heart's overflowing. I'm happy and free. I'll praise my redeemer who has rescued me. I'll sing of his wonderful to me. I'll sing. I like this verse. I'll sing of his wonderful mercy to me. I'll praise him till all men his goodness shall see. I'll sing of salvation at home and abroad. Till many shall hear the truth and trusting God. He brought me out of the mighty pl. He sets my feet on the rock till I say he puts a song in my soul today. Hallelujah. He brought me out of the life we play. He sets my feet on the road to stay. He puts a song in my soul today. I want to hear the musicians. I want to hear the musicians. The night I came. He brought me out of the mighty way. He puts my feet on the rock to stay. He puts a song in my soul today. A song of praise. Hallelujah. He puts a song in my soul today. Hallelujah. Remember us today. Thank you. God bless y'all. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many's got a song of praise this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. A song of praise. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Sister Zoe's got a song for us this morning. &gt;&gt; She's using a microphone up here. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm I'm a little nervous. Just pray for me. Jesus started finally blowing He was asleep in the stars. Does he not care that we perish? We are helpless and we're so afraid. And Jesus arose when they called him and said to them, "Where is your face? Cuz you prayed all night. Cuz you held on with all of your might. Child, your cries have woken the master. Oh, he knows your voice. Lift your hands. It's time to rejoice. Shout your Christen. &gt;&gt; All right. you without anyone. The storm of your life had begun. See no hope in the distance. You're flying just nowhere to run. And by now you're vessel and you're thinking that you'll surely drown. You cry out for help from the Savior. Don't you know that you can give up now? to pray. Oh my, cuz you held on of your might. Shout your cry. Have awoken the master. No, he knows your voice. Lift your hands. It's time to rejoice. Shout your Christ. Have the master. No worried. He's fast asleep. The winds are so deadly. The water is so deep. And try to be patient. Soon he'll be in peace. Just one word from his voice and let it all cease. Cuz you prayed all night. Cuz you held on with all of your might. Shout your cries. Have awoken the master. No, he knows your voice. Lift your heads. It's time to rejoice. Show your cries have woken the master child. Your cries have broken the master. Amen. Let's sing that. Cuz you've prayed all night. Cause you've held on with all of your might. child your cries have awoken the master. Oh, he knows your voice. Lift your hands. It's time to rejoice, child. Your cries have awoken. the Master because you've prayed all night because you've held on with all of your might. Child, your cries have awoken. The master. Oh, he knows your voice. Lift your hands. It's time to rejoice. Child, you'll cry. I've awoken the master. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I want you to know one thing. If you don't realize you're standing in the presence of Almighty this morning, &gt;&gt; I think you're dead. Praise God. I thank God he's there this morning. &gt;&gt; Well, if you if you will indulge us this morning, we got one more song. &gt;&gt; Brother Daniel has a special this morning. We're going to allow him to come and sing. bless us this morning. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Sorry I get a little nervous. Um this song I'm about to sing this morning. Um once I finally gotten a grasp of on English, you know, with the vowels and all that consonants, uh this was the first song I had sang for the church and was able to really articulate myself. So, um I'm hoping that it reaches and touches y'all as it did me. Um growing up wasn't a very big kid. Strong, fast, yes. But the eye test I failed for a lot of people. So, you know, a lot of people thought they could come in, shake me up, you know, get in my mind, rattle me up, but I shall not be moved. Amen. So, I'm not sure what key really to call. So just go. Jesus is my savior. I shall not be moved. In his love and favor, I shall not be moved. Just like a tree that's planted by the water. I shall not be Oh, I shall not be moved. I shall not be I shall not be moved. I shall not be I shall not be m like a tree that's planted by oh by the water I shall not be moved. Though the tempest raging, I shall not be moved. On the rock of aes, I shall not be moved. Just like a tree that's planted by the water, I shall not Oh, I shall not be moved. I shall not be I shall not be moved. I shall not be I shall not be moved. Just like a tree that's planted by the water, I shall not be moved. Yes. In my Christ abiding in his love I'm hiding says like a tree that's planted by the oh by the water I shall not be oh I shall not be moved. Oh I shall not be moved. Hallelujah. I shall not be I shall not be moved. Just like a tree that's plenty oh by the water I shall not be moved there if I trust him ever. He will fail me never.

Give him a big hand clap of prayer. Goodness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Good to be in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Good to worship. &gt;&gt; We like worship, don't we? Like worship. &gt;&gt; We love worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. Good bless God bless you for being here. Everybody. &gt;&gt; Good to have uh good to have everybody here. There's no visitors here. Everybody's here. Been here before &gt;&gt; and they have uh don't need no introduction. Good to see them all. Amen. Good to be in the house of the Lord. Turn around, shake somebody's hand, say, "God bless you." Good to be here. We appreciate everybody, all of us. God bless you, brother. Appreciate you. Good to be here. Amen. Amen. By way of a few announcements, remember there'll be no service this coming Wednesday be Christmas Eve and we will have uh uh no service then. Um happy holidays to all of you on and off. Um remember brother Chris Long will be here next Sunday. Um watch night service coming up. These are all the announcements next, not this coming Wednesday, next Wednesday at 8:00. Is it not switched? Um, I want to give you a report from Jamaica. U Keith Reed, I know y'all heard that Mon'nique had amp a she had her appendix taken out. &gt;&gt; That's what exactly what I said. She had her appendix taken out. So, she's doing good. And the Lord was good that she didn't have that attack in the air or have that attack somewhere else. she was at home with mommy and daddy. So we uh uh we thank the Lord for that. But we have sent um according to reports um now this is accumulative of four churches uh brother Thomas Ber um brother Dut Scott, brother Isaac Negron and this church have sent approximately $26,000 to Jamaica. Amen. And brother Keith sent me a report that they have bought the material for the two roofs to go to Northampton and to go on Ginger Hill. And that's about $14,000. So they've got that started. They've got the wood bought. Uh they still need to buy, I think, the uh the roofing material for for one more church. Excuse me. But that's $26,000 that the four churches have sent over there besides what brother Joe Green got and besides what other people have sent them, but we wanted to make sure to send it to Brother Keith so that the believers could have a um um you know benefit from it. Okay. Now, we did send a bunch of clothes and all that that y'all sent and put downstairs. We give it to brother Aaron and he took it to where he works and it's a division of Toyota and Toyota put it on a big boat and shipped it over there. But now that won't go to all the believers. That'll go to the whole people in the islands cuz we believe in helping humanity. We believe in helping our family first. &gt;&gt; But we believe that there is people there that were suffering that needed these things. So we we sent that out to them. So we sure do appreciate all of you for all the stuff you brought together. the funds and the food and the different things for us to send over there. And they said, "Thank you so very much." So, I'll give you another report when they finish or when they get almost finished with those two churches. Now, I don't know about the um uh the brother that lost his home there at Ginger Hill. I'll have to call and ask about that, but we pretty much the funds that we sent is probably going to be able to take care of most of that. The $26,000 from just us are going to take care of that. So, it wasn't just from the church. It was the four churches. Uh, Brother Brad uh Powell from Brother Ber's church jumped on the bandwagon and they um took up money and took up money twice actually. And then Brother Dutch Scott wanted to put some money in brother Isaac Negron. So, they sent it to us and we sent it through um Wells Fargo because we're that's our account Wells Fargo and we were able to send it instantly to brother Keith. Only cost like $25, right Jim? to send the money over there. So, we did that. Got that sent over there and and we'll get a report from them and if they need any more, we'll talk about it later later. But, but as of right now, I think that's enough for them to get started with. And like I say again, appreciate all of you having a part in it. So, and we sure appreciate all the gifts and the and the stuff that the last couple weeks and thank you so very much. And we appreciate the gift of eternal life more than anything. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I've um I've been asked by two separate people about having Bible study again. So, I want to kind of put it before you this coming year. Uh maybe having it like once every two months. U we'll talk about it. Maybe we'll discuss it in January once all the holidays are over and brother Joe and him's going to be gone. Luis and them's going to be gone and our line's gone and different ones are going to be gone uh during the holidays and that's fine. Go visit your family and uh come back to your church family. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz this is the one we're going to live eternity with. The other one we'll see. We'll claim them all. We don't throw any of them out. We going to claim them all. So I was telling brother Boyd, I said, "Brother Keith3 told me one time, he said, "Brother Wade, that's the white throne judgment." He said, "We will have more power." &gt;&gt; We will have more power than the prevailing power that was in this Bible that said they got to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. Because you understand one thing, somebody that never knew God ever, never knew about Jesus Christ, if they did something good for you through you, you would impart the eternal life to them. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's how powerful your eternal life is. And you know what? That eternal life is going to carry you all the way to the white throne. Not to be in judgment, &gt;&gt; but to be a judge. &gt;&gt; And you know what? If you judge righteous, &gt;&gt; somebody's been good to you, your family's been good to you, your mama, your daddy, anybody that's not a believer, claim them. &gt;&gt; Claim them even at the white throne judge. Why not? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's for big things. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Cuz that's where we're going to have the most prevailing power. We will have eternal life. We'll be eternal people. and we'll have the mind of God. &gt;&gt; So, we'll not do anything that he didn't think we did. We're going to do before the foundation of the world. But he wants to do what? He wants to do it through us. &gt;&gt; Okay? If not, then we can just go home and sit down and just close our eyes and let God talk to us in our brain. Well, guess what? Most of the time, that ain't God that talks to me like that. &gt;&gt; Well, hello, somebody. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, pray for me and and brother Gay because he's he's admitting the same thing. So, just pray for us that the devil won't be playing in our head anymore. But back then, ne then we'll have the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; We won't have to worry about that guy. He's gone. He's in the He's in this He's in that sea. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Of of of We ain't going to never remember that guy no more. &gt;&gt; The former things will pass away. &gt;&gt; Behold, what? &gt;&gt; All things will be made new. &gt;&gt; God bless you. We're uh uh good to have you again. We're going to stay on the Son of Man. We're going to try to get through some of this uh through Matthew 24. And uh now listen, there's only one man on earth that ever understood really who the devil was and where he was. &gt;&gt; All right? And that's the son of man. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He sat there and he told them, they said, "Is it me? Is it me? Is it me? Is it me at the at the supper? Is it me? Is it me? And he said, "Whoever sops the bowl," well here goes Judas the bowl and nobody knew a thing. &gt;&gt; Right. Exactly. &gt;&gt; But Jesus knew &gt;&gt; cuz he was the son of man. &gt;&gt; So keep that in the back of your mind. The son of man is the only only form of God &gt;&gt; that can tell where the devil's at. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everybody else is deceived &gt;&gt; except the group that's going to take the body change and get out of here in a rapture. All right. So, I just believe we're part of that. I believe that we are in the right message. &gt;&gt; I don't mean this building, but we're in the right building. We're in the right tabernacle. We're in the right mode of transportation. We're in the right way. We got to get oursel out of the way, but we got to get in the way that that that God sent us a prophet to go down that path. And that's what I believe that these seals are for. They're not just to expose the Antichrist, but they're to reveal Jesus Christ and where he's at. &gt;&gt; He's in his people. Amen. So, let's bow our heads to heavenly father. Lord, thank you for this day. Thank you for all the songs and the worship, Lord. Now, we're going to worship you, Lord, in in speaking of the gospel. Father, I pray that you'd be with each one. Lord, bless the ears to hear, Lord, and the hearts to receive today, Lord, what you have for them. Father, forgive us of our sins and mistakes. Lord, bless the ones that are sick, that are not here. Brother Joe and them that are traveling, Brother Luis and them getting ready to travel. Sister Regina already where she's at, Lord. The ones that are traveling, if we miss anybody, Lord, just protect each one. Father, this time of Christmas time, Lord, is a time that that we need to uh reflect on you more and know that it's not you that was born in a manger on December 25th. That it was we know it was in April, but Lord, we know that we had a birth. That was the manger of our heart that you were birthed when we were lost in sin and didn't know anything. We were out in the world running around. Father, you come to us and said, "Be mine. I want you to be mine." And we accepted him in our heart. And we thank you for that, Lord. That we accepted you, Lord. Now, Lord, I pray that you accept us. Accept the gifts that we give you, Lord. The things that we have today, Lord, to give back to you, Father, which is listening and hearing the word of God. Lord, just bless each one, Father. Be with the bride around the world. be with the ones in the foreign fields like brother Keith and different ones as they navigate through all that time of of turmoil and things in this country. Lord, I pray that you'd be with each bride over there and all the humanity, Lord, that you'll be with them, Father. And may they see Jesus Christ in all these things. We ask you in your name, Jesus Christ. Amen. 1 Corinthians 2:9, but as it is written, I hath not seen nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared. Now watch, for them that love him. So that puts it in a different category. &gt;&gt; All right. I like I like Paul. He He brings you He brings you a dissertation and he says, "This is why." &gt;&gt; So we're going to get the things that God has prepared prepared for us if we love him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; They're prepared for everybody. But you and I have got to be the one to accept it. &gt;&gt; But God hath revealed him unto who? Us &gt;&gt; by his spirit. For the spirit searches all things, yay, the deep things of God. And that's the um in one of the um versions of the Bible says, even the inmost depths of God's being. And that's what we're here for. &gt;&gt; We're here to learn more of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. and his being and his substance and what he is and and how that he's been hid from everything else and and without a revelation he's hid from us. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you can be seated and I'll continue reading though. Let me read this for brother Brandham trying to do God a service in 1965. Now, we're we're getting ready to start on the seals. Uh like I said before, we've kind of piecing this thing together because of people being out. And uh we're going to be out in January. Um a couple of days, Brother Richard Wilson is he just about pretty much lassoed me to come preach for him. So I'm going to do that on January the 11th and then on the 4th I'll be gone to hunting in Ohio. But we'll be back and then we'll get started end of January, 1 of February straight through every service will be we'll talk about the seals. Okay, there by way. Now, without the opening of the seals, we will not take a body change. Without the opening of the seals, &gt;&gt; will not get the fullness. And that don't mean you're not a Christian. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I don't ever want to don't don't think that that because you don't understand fully everything that you're that you're not a Christian. No, the devil's telling you that, but we're not telling you that. &gt;&gt; But to live a full Christian life, he wants us to be what? A stature of a perfect man. He wants us to be Christians to where if you can't find me, you can find him. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; He's the one you need to talk to anyway. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. As we were talking last Sunday or before, I said I, you know, I being a pastor, that's it's been different the past year or so. But I found out one thing. You're never going to make it by a human mortal man. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's got to take the leadership of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; through a group of men by the five-fold ministry that's going to bring you to perfection. You just every once in a while, um, Brother Gabe, you need a a shepherd &gt;&gt; with a shepherd hook &gt;&gt; or or break your leg every once in a while to keep you in the fold. But it's God that's going to do the revealing. It's God that's going to do all the work. All right? And we appreciate all of you and we thank you so very much. I the devil just beat me up the other day because I said I didn't want to be your pastor. That's not exactly true. I didn't want to be I didn't say I want this job. Okay. I didn't I didn't hand out flyers and posters and you know I've been through that voting thing, you know, so I won't be and I won't be the mayor after a few weeks. So I didn't become I'm not a mayor anymore. So, um um that that was just something that I did to help the community and I believe I did help the community and the community got better for it and now I hand it over to somebody else cuz I got a bigger job to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, um but you know there is going to be government in heaven. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The government shall be on his shoulder. &gt;&gt; There will be kings and priests. And brother Bram said, if you got kings, you got to have something to rule over. Right. &gt;&gt; All right. So, not with a rod of iron. That's down here. &gt;&gt; But we do like he he he leads us with what? Nail scarred hands. He leads us by example number one and by what? Grace number two. &gt;&gt; All right. So, we're going to read this in just a minute because when we get to the headstone, there's only one thing Brother Ram talks about the headstone. And he talks about it being Jesus Christ, being the son of man. But he takes you back to the scripture in in Jeremiah, I believe it is, that says that the headstone will come crying grace, grace unto it. Okay? &gt;&gt; So that's the headstone. The headstone is Jesus Christ. The headstone today when we're going to read this scripture in Matthew 24, that was the headstone. Now, what do you mean by headstone? Headstone is the head man. It's the when you have an arch that comes up like this in a doorway, right here in the middle of that arch is a stone. If you've walked through some stone archways, there's one big one in the middle. That one is if you pull that one out, it all collapses. &gt;&gt; So that head stone has to be there. We ain't talking about headstones in a grave. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. We put them on there. It's symbolic that there is a head. There is a head of of the whole human race. But we have a headstone that's not out in the grave. &gt;&gt; He's what? In the pillar of our heart. He's in the arch of our heart. &gt;&gt; And if we don't have him as the headstone, then we're going to crumble and fall. &gt;&gt; All right. So, just remember that. That's why in a nutshell, that's why the son of man ministry had to come back in the end time &gt;&gt; cuz it's the headstone to the church. It's the head man, which was the son of man &gt;&gt; back in power again in his people. &gt;&gt; What? Doing the same things he did when he was on earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which is preach a perfect message, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; To an imperfect people. &gt;&gt; Who took my water? &gt;&gt; I did. I said it right here before church started. Somebody drank my drink. Somebody drink my water. Aaron, did you drink my water? No, I said it right here. It was about half full. Well, who? Enjoy it. Bless you. Be like a priest looking for holy water. Somebody done stole everything. I bet Lu has got it back there. He don't have the door open. But that's why. No. Oh, who got it? Don't point. Everybody's pointing at everybody else. Brother Manuel, you got my water, didn't you? &gt;&gt; You don't know if it's yours. &gt;&gt; No, brother Manuel got it. Did you drink it? You'll be blessed all day. &gt;&gt; I brushed my teeth three days ago. So, we're good. We're just family here. &gt;&gt; Okay. Just family here. But the reason the son of man, if he's standing on earth telling us this, that's why I was thinking the other day, why did Jesus stand on earth and preach the seals? Why? Because I'm going to tell you something. Nobody understood what he was saying. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Nobody. And then when brother Brandham gets here and he starts preaching on the seals, what'd he say? You ain't getting it. It ain't for you. This is not for you right now. You know, go and live a simple life. Jesus tells them that when they're when we're washing feet, what does Jesus say? He said, "You don't know what I'm doing, but you will know hereafter." &gt;&gt; Cuz on the day of Pentecost, the hereafter came. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They understood that. Peter was like, "You ain't washing nothing of mine." Jesus said, "You I don't wash your feet. You ain't part of me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Peter was like, "Wash me all, Lord." Jesus said, "No, I ain't got to do all that. I'm going to wash you within on the day of Pentecost and then you're going to help others get washed. But I want you to wash your feet as a symbol &gt;&gt; of humility. &gt;&gt; We should be the humblest people on the face of the earth. If Jesus Christ, God Almighty in human flesh, the man that created the water, created the bowl, and created your feet, if you can't wash somebody else's feet, you're not going to heaven. &gt;&gt; Oh, get don't get quiet on me. Because in other words, what the problem is now is I see is not receiving headship. &gt;&gt; Headstone headship. &gt;&gt; That's what I told you many times. A lot of people want Jesus. &gt;&gt; They want Jesus to come into their life, but they want him to be Lord Jesus Christ. Do they want the Lord to take over? &gt;&gt; Cuz Jesus was just a man. Come on, somebody. He was just a man walking on the face of the earth and he was in a body that was dying. &gt;&gt; Now, are they looking at that man? Are they looking at the man that was inside of him? &gt;&gt; Because that man is inside of him in you and I now. &gt;&gt; And then what that makes him? That makes him the Lord of your life. &gt;&gt; So that's why we baptize in the name of the Lord. We we identify that he is the Lord of our life. So let us make it a a New Year's resolution that for him to be more of the Lord of our life, &gt;&gt; not to be someone that sits in the background. We want him in the forefront. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. So brother Bam, he comes up and this is in 1965. So what is he telling the people? He said, "The mysteries will be revealed in the last day." Now what did he always say? He said, "We are prophetic people with prophetic insight. We love revelation. We love the deep things of God." And and and don't get me wrong, I love everything's got to start with a foundation. Even when we get to Zerubable, he put a foundation. There was a foundation there for him to build on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we got to have the foundation, which is the sure cornerstone. Jesus was the cornerstone of the church. But remember, he's got to be the headstone of your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the cornerstone is right down here, but he wants to be up there. &gt;&gt; It's the same symbol. It's just up higher. &gt;&gt; And that's the headstone. &gt;&gt; So the headstone of the church is the son of man ministry. &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; All right. So if we got to understand that to go further, then we got to understand who the son of man is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because they ask that question. Who is this son of man? But now remember, brother Brandham had a message to bring and it was in a two-fold manner. &gt;&gt; All right? He said in the church age book, we've read it. Dad read it a million times. So have I this message of Malachi 4 is going to do two things. &gt;&gt; One, he's going to restore the gifts back. He's going to restore us back to the upper room experience. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Peter, James, and all those. Okay, that's the faith of the fathers. Now remember though, restoring back to the faith of the fathers will not take you in a body change &gt;&gt; because it did if it would have it would have done them already. &gt;&gt; So remember that was lost. Remember even the Bible says the name of the Lord was lost during the ages. Why? They started baptizing the name of father, son, holy ghost. They totally lost the name. &gt;&gt; But they baptized in the name over here in the first church age, second church age, part of the third church age. Everybody with me? So now you got to have the alpha bride. The omega bride's got to be just like the alpha bride. Plus, &gt;&gt; this plus was, listen, don't get me wrong. This plus over here was another church age. &gt;&gt; Another move of God, another act of God. &gt;&gt; Now, over here where we at in the seventh church age, there is no eighth church age. &gt;&gt; There's no ninth church age. So, this is it. Right? &gt;&gt; So everything's got to be wrapped up in this message in this day in the time recognizing your day &gt;&gt; today &gt;&gt; and his message. So look, not when he starts out doing this what prayer lines. &gt;&gt; That was not his message. That was restoring the faith back for so people could have faith in this man called William Brham. &gt;&gt; But now remember that faith was superficial to some, &gt;&gt; right? That's right. &gt;&gt; Because once he started preaching the true message and he started preaching water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he started preaching no eternal hell. When he started preaching all these different things, what happened? Did those people come with him? No. &gt;&gt; They went gone. They gone bye-bye. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the real message then is not going to be a public show. It's not going to be to to um I won't call his name, but the guy that's got 600 800,000 people. No, I'm not talking about in the message. I'm talking about out in the world. You know, 10,000 people in a man's church said he don't preach in sin. Well, maybe that's why he's got 10,000 people in his church. He's got 10,000 sinners. &gt;&gt; I believe I will. &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm telling you, if you don't preach against sin, why is what are we doing here? Amen. &gt;&gt; And I ain't talking about that. And brother Bram said, "Now, now sin ain't smoking, drinking, gambling, and cussing." &gt;&gt; He said, "It's unbelief. &gt;&gt; It's not believing that what God said." That's why Brother Ram said, "We sin every day." Why do we sin every day? You say, "I don't cuss, drink, smoke." No, you sin because you don't believe certain things. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Pray for me then. There's certain times that I don't believe certain things. &gt;&gt; You do, too. &gt;&gt; But I know one thing's for sure. It's like brother Ram said, if you'll lay in the presence of the sun long enough, &gt;&gt; you will ripen. &gt;&gt; You will become what God said you would become. &gt;&gt; And if he said it before the foundation of the world, like I said many times before, don't ever say, "God don't love me. All right. &gt;&gt; He can't change his mind. &gt;&gt; If he ever loved you one speck of a second before the foundation of the world, he can never change his mind. &gt;&gt; Now, there's ups and downs and ins and outs and family and friends and all that that we got that we have problems with, but God is never going to change his mind. &gt;&gt; You will be a child of God if you were a child of God before the if he thought of you before the foundation of the world. That's the seed. The seed is what was in God's mind? &gt;&gt; Because remember, when it was in God's mind, it was eternal. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; When man started coming down here and adding natural seed, you understand what I'm talking about? Adam and Eve and different ones. That's when he got a problem. &gt;&gt; We got to go back to that. You must be born again &gt;&gt; and have the mind of Christ. Let him birth you in the manger as the song says the manger of your heart. &gt;&gt; So now brother Ram says look not when he starts doing this but when he begins to sound his message not the years of preparation in other words not the prayer lines. Now I want to get something really clear. There's groups in the message that believe that what brother Ram said from from 47 to 63. You don't have to believe all of it because he said things wrong. We just got to believe what he said from 63 to 65. Well, I'm like my dad always said, if you don't believe and and listen to 47 to 63, that's your foundation. &gt;&gt; You can forget about 63 to 65. Amen. &gt;&gt; Your foundation is, like I said before, it's getting those little things down. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; The details. &gt;&gt; When you start building a house, what's the most important thing? Your foundation. &gt;&gt; You can build the prettiest Tajma Hall in the world and three or four years later, you'll get cracks in your wall. &gt;&gt; You'll get your house leaning over. Why? Your foundation is not sure. We need as the Bible says a sure foundation &gt;&gt; which is Jesus Christ. If we keep looking to him &gt;&gt; then we'll be fine. &gt;&gt; Then the building will stand on its own. &gt;&gt; But brother Brown said not the years in preparation but when he begins to sound the message then these mysteries then will be revealed. And brother Ram said and here they are not knowing them and you people are a witness of that. He told them right where it was at &gt;&gt; that the headstone message was being preached. Now, this is 1965. He'd already preached the seals, but he's get coming down to the end of his ministry. And he's telling the people, "This is what you're This is why I came for &gt;&gt; this is it. This is my ministry right here. This is what the seventh angel messenger has come to bring. He to restore and then &gt;&gt; then to reveal the seals, to reveal the thunders that are contained in the seals. And what are the thunders? It's a revelation. When the seal breaks, there's a thunder. &gt;&gt; I'll read you. Well, don't worry now. Luke 17:30 says, "Even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed." &gt;&gt; Not when he shows up, brother Joe. Not when he shows up, when he's revealed. It took us from 1963 to 202 almost six &gt;&gt; to get the revelation. &gt;&gt; Come on. We're still here. &gt;&gt; So, we're still God's still revealing himself, trying to get us to see that he did come in 63 in the word. &gt;&gt; But just as they rejected him the first time, they've rejected him again. Remember, Judas hung around long enough to get holy and sanctified. &gt;&gt; But like I said before, 11 other people in that room did not think Judas was the one. Right? &gt;&gt; He's going to go, "Yo, you know, oh, well, Jesus told him go do what he's going to do." Well, he was telling him exactly who was going to betray him, but they're like, "Well, he's going to go and buy some more food or he's going to go pay for this food that we ate." They had no no clue. But the son of man is the only one that can tell what that other spirit is like. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Without it will you will be deceived. &gt;&gt; So, here's the son of man. He's on earth. He's getting ready to preach a sermon and they don't understand any of it. But they asked him a couple questions. Jesus went out and departed from the temple. And his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple. And Jesus said unto them, "See you not all these things? Verily I say unto you, there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down." Now, when was that? That was in AD70, when Titus destroyed the temple. &gt;&gt; All right. And as he sat upon the Mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? What shall be the sign of your coming and of the end of the world? All right. So Jesus answered and said, now we're going to go start as brother Ram did in the uh sixth seal &gt;&gt; and parallel the two because Jesus answered and said unto them, take heed that no man deceive you. Okay? For many shall come in my name, what? Jesus &gt;&gt; or Christ. And shall deceive many. That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, let's let brother Brandham explain that just for a second because what happened in the first seal you had a horse. I was listening yesterday to um No, it was coming back from Kentucky. 10 virgins. On the 10 virgins, brother Brandham says that the white horse was the Holy Ghost riding through the church ages. &gt;&gt; But we know it was progressive revelation. We know that he we know that he's just a human being just like the rest of us. And listen, until God revealed, don't know, we don't need to say, "Well, I knew that when I first Well, bless God, pray for me." I didn't. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of things I've had to learn over and over and over, Brother Kylie, over and over again. &gt;&gt; But you know what? Stay here long enough and you'll get it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Stay here long enough and you'll get it. Not I'm not I'm not talking about here. I'm talking about in the message. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; Don't ever think when you walk through that door you got it made. &gt;&gt; You might have a good seat sometimes or not. Have to sit somewhere else and have that look when you go by like they're sitting in my seat again. So he brothers read a thought there but I'm not going to say anything. Revelation 6 verse one. I'm just glad you're looking for a seat. &gt;&gt; Okay. And I saw the lamb when he had opened one of the seals. This is brother Brandham. He goes back to Revelation 6. And I heard it was a noise of thunder. One of the four beasts saying, "Come and see." Now, what beast was that? That was the lion. L I O N. The lion spirit of the four combat beasts said, "John, come and look and see. Something's fixing to happen." Right &gt;&gt; now remember John was only commissioned to write what he saw not not reveal it write what he saw &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; okay &gt;&gt; he because Jesus told him revelations one he said write these things and send them to the churches &gt;&gt; so that's what John's job was to do so he saw these symbols he said behold a white horse he saw a white horse he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer Now, this is what tore a lot of people up because brother Brandham said, "Oh, this fell is the antichrist, &gt;&gt; right?" &gt;&gt; Because a lot of people, a lot of commentaries said that was Jesus Christ. Even brother Random said mighty conqueror actually in 1957, he shows him riding through the church ages um shooting a bow of of love and had a crown on it, you know? &gt;&gt; That's why we needed a prophet. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we needed the son of man ministry to come in a cloud like he left in a cloud. &gt;&gt; The son of man left in a cloud. &gt;&gt; He came back as the son of God in your soul as the new birth. &gt;&gt; But he's promised just like I read you in the days of what? The coming of the son of man, these things will be revealed. Well, where'd he come? He came in 1963. He didn't come physically. He will not come physically until the millennium. But he is physically in me and you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's why that there's more of us got to be out of here &gt;&gt; that more of him can be in here. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Listen, that's the whole walk of Christianity. &gt;&gt; It's not just coming and sitting in a church pew. &gt;&gt; Become what you see. &gt;&gt; Become what you believe. Believe it and live it. But who do we find this per great person was? He's the antichrist. &gt;&gt; But remember, every clue we needed was in the Bible when John saw it, wrote it down, scrolled it up, &gt;&gt; put it in an earthn vessel, and they found it years later. That's right. &gt;&gt; And that was the apocalypse or the book of revelations. &gt;&gt; So John just wrote what he saw. He didn't make any commentary about it. He wrote what he saw. All right. And it was a wild horse. Well, you would think. Listen. But we got to remember we are we are dealing with the most deceiving person ever &gt;&gt; to be on the earth or heaven or anywhere. Remember, he's originated in heaven. &gt;&gt; He originated in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm talking about the devil. &gt;&gt; And he fooled a bunch of angels to come down here and try to fool a bunch of us. &gt;&gt; But what a fool he is. &gt;&gt; Cuz somebody is going to take this message and live it. And like brother Ram said, he said, "Satan will not know what to do with you." &gt;&gt; Cuz there's a lot of people he knows how to handle. I'm preach somebody. He There's people that he knows how to handle. He knows how to manipulate every one of us. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Brother Bram said, "Satan's got one lick at you." He knows your weak spot. He said, "You better cover it up. &gt;&gt; You better cover it up because that's the that's what Satan's going to start poking at." &gt;&gt; And listen, everybody sitting in this room knows what your weakness is. &gt;&gt; I don't know it. I don't want to know it. &gt;&gt; But you know what your weakness is because you live with you. &gt;&gt; So you take that and work on it. &gt;&gt; Work on it. work on keeping that thing covered. But he's the Antichrist. But Jesus never said he was the Antichrist. Jesus said what? Jesus said what? Take heed that no man deceive you. Well, this man did deceive the whole world except for those that are what? Marked with a mark or have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; If you don't have the Holy Ghost, you're deceived. That's right. &gt;&gt; For many shall come in my name. In other What? In my name. Preaching saying, "I am Christ and shall deceive many." &gt;&gt; See, there's your seal. It's the Antichrist. Remember, he had a bow with no arrows. He went forth conquering and to conquer. So, in the first couple of church ages, that's what that white righteous church did. Listen, Satan knew he couldn't get a true Christian &gt;&gt; with, you know, bar hopping and come on. &gt;&gt; He's in here today. He's not out there. &gt;&gt; He's in here today and he brought his sleepy demons with most for some of y'all. That's kind of foolish to send a sleepy demon. I wish the demons would fall asleep. I'm not talking about none of y'all. That's okay. Let me back up again. I just drank some water. Think about that for a minute. I want the sleepy demons to fall asleep. Not anyway. But he's here and he knows how to deceive you. &gt;&gt; But there's going to come a time. Remember, there was one man he could never deceive. &gt;&gt; Who was that? The son of man. He was never deceived &gt;&gt; ever. He knew everything that was going on. So if the Son of Man ministry is to do that, then the Son of Man ministry's got to do that here. &gt;&gt; Beware. Think about it. We come to a place and we look at this white righteous church. We look at this white horse and we look at this strong guy with a bow up. I mean, he's got that bow up like this and he's riding forth and he's conquering everything, you know, without even an error. &gt;&gt; But he's what? He's conquering by deception. &gt;&gt; He's deceiving the people into believing a lie. &gt;&gt; Brother Brown said the Bible said the lie, &gt;&gt; which is the one Satan told Eve at the beginning. &gt;&gt; All right. So, it's Antichrist. And until you're born again, you are under that Antichrist anointing. &gt;&gt; Right. Sorry. &gt;&gt; Because all those all those without the Holy Ghost will be deceived. That's what the Bible says. &gt;&gt; All right. That's not an opinion of a preacher. That's the Bible. &gt;&gt; All right. So, first 2 Thessalonians. And now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him, that you be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter, as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand. &gt;&gt; Now, be careful. The day of Christ is at hand. You got to go back to Matthew 24 and see that he said they would be false ones here. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So, you got to be careful. You got to keep them separate. All right? Keep them separate. All right. So, let no man deceive you by any means, &gt;&gt; for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first. And we see that happening right now. &gt;&gt; We see that falling away happening. and that man of sin be revealed the son of predition who opposes and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he as God sitth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God &gt;&gt; that's pretty close remember you not that when I was with you I told you these things and now you know what withholding that he might be revealed in his time. What? When he wrote this back, whatever it was, he knew he wasn't going to be revealed then. &gt;&gt; All right. And now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time. All right. For the mystery of iniquity doth already work, only he who now letth will let until he be taken out of the way. God letth will let until he the bride be taken out of the way. Brother Ram told us that. And then shall that wicked one be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the brightness spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming. Even him whose coming is after the workings of Satan with all power look power signs and wonders &gt;&gt; the devil &gt;&gt; and with all deceivleness of unrighteousness and them that perish. Look, go back to what I said a minute ago. God will reveal himself to those who what? Love him. &gt;&gt; Listen to this right here. Because they receive not the love of the truth. Some people can receive the truth, &gt;&gt; but they can't live it. &gt;&gt; They just can't live it. They can receive the truth. Well, listen. We've seen people be in the message 30, 40 years. That's right. &gt;&gt; They receive the truth, &gt;&gt; but they didn't receive the love of it. &gt;&gt; That's right. Because the love of it will constrain you to be right here and not somewhere else. &gt;&gt; And again, not I'm not saying this building. I'm talking about in this message, the truth of the hour and not out there saying that it's false and brother Brown was this and this and it's nothing but the devil. &gt;&gt; It's that rider that's now on the pale horse. He's got all three powers working in him right now. Satan. But praise God, God's got all his power working in a bride. &gt;&gt; You know what? The devil might be looking for Jesus around here somewhere. &gt;&gt; Cuz listen, I'm going to I'm just going to give you a little revelation here. If Brother Brandham asked when he went across the curtain of time, he said, "Can I see him?" Right? He was in the sixth dimension. Everybody with me? He was in the sixth dimension. He said, "Oh, good. Okay. I want to see him. What the angel say? He's higher. You can't see him right now. Well, he was in the seventh dimension. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to tell you, there's two dimensions I know Satan can't get in. &gt;&gt; Six and seven. &gt;&gt; Six, we know he ain't there. &gt;&gt; Seven is God Almighty himself. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, I see. So, you're saying, "What' you say, brother? Satan is not understanding that even in that seventh dimension, he's in your dimension. &gt;&gt; He's inside of you sealed. &gt;&gt; Remember, if you sealed, the devil don't know. And can't, Brother Brham said, if I say something, he said the devil can attack it. &gt;&gt; He said, but if I hold it in my heart, &gt;&gt; come on. If I hold it in my heart, even the devil can't get in there. He can't understand that that love affair between you and you and God. &gt;&gt; When you go behind that tent and you go in there with God and he speaks to you and gives you revelation, Satan's nowhere to be found. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's gone off trying to deceive somebody else. &gt;&gt; Remember, Brother Bam said we come we try to come to a place to where Satan wouldn't know what to do with us. &gt;&gt; Well, he didn't know what to do with Jesus. He took him up on the mountain. He took him up on the he he took him in the temple. took him off and and all he said was scripture says &gt;&gt; no scripture says that's all you got to do he did like brother said he didn't perform one miracle he just quoted him the scripture and walked off &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and that's the same way with us and with all deceit of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved and for this cause God now watch for this cause God sends them strong delusion &gt;&gt; that they should believe a lie. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Believe a lie. &gt;&gt; That they all might be damned who believe not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness. &gt;&gt; So that's a white horse. And then he gets off his white horse, he gets on a red horse. And then Jesus is standing there and he said, "Oh, you shall hear of wars." There's never been a war fought that there's not blood been shed &gt;&gt; except the spiritual war and and that took bloodshed too. &gt;&gt; And you shall hear wars and rumors of wars. Red horse, what? Red blood, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; See that you be not troubled, for all these things must come to pass. Now listen today, I'm telling you, everything that you've went through must come to pass for your perfection. If you will believe that instead of the oh wo is me, why is God pointing his finger at me? God might be pointing his finger at you, but what he's doing is he says, "Devil, go for him, but you're not going to get them." &gt;&gt; What do you do with Job? He said, "Hey, come and look at Job." Job was sitting like we were talking about the other day, Brother Gabe. Job was sitting in his lounge chair that one of them vibrating recliners that's got heat. How do I know that? I've got a recliner that's never mind. We have a massage chair. But here's Job and I mean he's like my 401k's got a couple million dollars in it and I got some man cows I can't count. Uh my kids are all going to church. &gt;&gt; They're all alive. They're all with me and I'm doing good. Then all of a sudden, all of a sudden though, all of a sudden, it wasn't that, come on. It wasn't that Job did something wrong, &gt;&gt; but what it was was is God wanted to show. He had an eternal purpose. &gt;&gt; He had an eternal purpose to let his son go through this. Come on, somebody. He let him go through that. Listen, if you've had a bad day, go read book of Job, first two chapters. Amen. &gt;&gt; He lost everything. &gt;&gt; Even his little comfy chair. &gt;&gt; It burned to the ground. &gt;&gt; He was sitting on an ash heap of his of his house, &gt;&gt; scraping boils off of his body, &gt;&gt; and there was nobody left but his wife. And she was doubting him, too. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So, Job was there all by himself. Why? Why &gt;&gt; he did? No, he did. No, he did all the sacrifices. He did everything he was supposed to do. But God wanted to show, listen, show an eternal proof. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We'll talk. Hey, listen. We'll talk to Job, but we'll talk about Job for an eternity. &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll meet the guy &gt;&gt; and he'll tell us his experience, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And we'll like Job, through your adversity, there's no telling how many people. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. I'm talking about us, too. There's no telling how many people were affected by that man going through one of the most horrible thing. He lost seven of his kids. &gt;&gt; They died. &gt;&gt; He had seven, well, actually had 14 funerals if they were married. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cattle were gone. 401k was gone. any way to make an income's gone because his cows and chickens and all that's gone. &gt;&gt; So he's he's he's he's sitting in a in a depressed state. &gt;&gt; But he said, "I know my redeemer liveth." &gt;&gt; I know something's going to come out of this good. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, how many of us when we're going through it, can we say the same thing? &gt;&gt; No. We usually say, "What I do?" Well, maybe God wants to just use you as an example &gt;&gt; to show someone someone else because remember the four the four um letters of testimony is t &gt;&gt; you got to go through a test &gt;&gt; to get a testimony. But listen, the Bible tells us the suffering of this world is not to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us at his coming. &gt;&gt; We may look like horrible, destitute, don't know what we're doing, but you know what, brother and sister, that's God what he wants. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He wants the cream of the crop, &gt;&gt; but the cream of the crop might not always look good &gt;&gt; physically or emotionally. We may be a wreck, but God is going to do with his bride what he said he was going to do. He's going to perfect her here. We're going to be without Come on, somebody. We're going to be without spot or wrinkle here. We're not going to wait till we get there. &gt;&gt; We're heading toward it right now. When you have a body change, it'll be in this dimension. &gt;&gt; It will not be in a protected place. &gt;&gt; Those in the sixth dimension, it's just a protected, beautiful place. But remember, they're wanting to come here. &gt;&gt; Why? I don't know. But I do know. &gt;&gt; You know why? Because they want to be humans again. &gt;&gt; It is in our DNA &gt;&gt; to be a human. &gt;&gt; And we can't deny it. &gt;&gt; In one more time. One more time. Are you ready? &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's DNA, God's DNA, he wanted to be a human. Right? &gt;&gt; He always wanted to be a human. You say, "Why?" Number one, God can't change his mind. &gt;&gt; So, if he wanted to be a human, he's going to be one. &gt;&gt; If he's going to create the world, he was going to do it. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. We ought to put our We ought to put everything we got in that &gt;&gt; that what God does and says, he can't change his mind. So, what do we do, though? We go, I'm going to change my mind about that. No, you need to get over in his mind and it may change your mind. &gt;&gt; But when we get into these seals, listen, the seals is not this great uh, you know, drawings and and horses and and you know, I'm going to I'm going to draw you a big picture over here, you know, and I'm going to have stuff blowing up and No, the seals were given to us to show expose the devil, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. &gt;&gt; Who he is, what he's doing, and why he's here. But I'm going to tell you something. You know what the seals have done? The seals tell us where we're going, where we've been, where we going, why we're here, and all that. &gt;&gt; It's for me and you because it's for your redemption. &gt;&gt; You can read all this and you can have all these charts and all these horses and all. It's for your redemption. &gt;&gt; It's for your perfection. &gt;&gt; It's for your day of grace. &gt;&gt; In other ain't getting to grace anyway. You got to give me some grace here today for a little bit. &gt;&gt; Y'all sang for an hour. I'm gonna preach for three. So it's triple. You get triple time. So &gt;&gt; no, that's okay. But a red horse is what? It comes up to the next rider. Now remember that white righteous horse is still riding. &gt;&gt; It's riding today. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And and and as I said before, God is the one that is an exclusionist or a segregator. I'm not. &gt;&gt; I have people in the denominations that I love, but I know if that system eats them up, they're not going to heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother Brandham. And when he gets to these seals, he said, "I know now why I hated that system so bad." &gt;&gt; Why? Because it comes straight from the devil. &gt;&gt; Every denomination &gt;&gt; come from the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. never did come from God. &gt;&gt; And there's 13,000 of them now according to the internet. And the internet's always right. So, &gt;&gt; what are y'all laughing for? Google it. It's like the other day, you know, I was u talking about Jesus, you know, being born in a manger, and we always thought it was a wood manger with hay. It wasn't. It's a piece of granite that was heuned out. Well, the guys in Ohio because what happened was in the city of Bethlehem is where they raised the the perfect lambs &gt;&gt; because remember the lamb can't have a blemish, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So, they would bring those lambs in. How perfect is this? They bring those lambs in and they'd be birthed on this hollow piece. Jesus was born on a slab of granite and they laid his body on a slab of granite, but it's a h it's a hollowed out piece of granite and that's where the baby lambs are and they can wash them and keep them and and make sure that they're perfect. So, a manger is where you keep cows, but but that thing that he was put in was not a piece of wood. And if it's on it's online, just look it up. It's got to be true. It is true because I re researched it. It is where Bethlehem is where they had the greatest amount of perfect animals, perfect lambs for sacrifice cuz you got to have them. I mean, they're sacrificing all the time, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And they would put him on that and you can see if you look it up, it's it's just about this big and it's hollowed out. So, the group from Ohio, they were having a um Christmas theme, you know, party and a show or put on production. Brother Elisha sent me a message. He said, "Now, we got to get rid of this wood thing now. What are we going to do? Where are we going to find a slab of granite?" I said, "Don't worry about it, brother. Just it's okay." But, you know, the things that we hear, we sometimes we don't research. We just go, "Yeah, well, he was born in a manger. He was born in a a bail of hay or you know that's not what it was. And the and the the where he was born was it wasn't a a stable like we think stable. &gt;&gt; It was a cave &gt;&gt; built into the side of a mountain. &gt;&gt; He was buried in a cave inside of a mountain. &gt;&gt; He began that way. He ended that way. But praise God, he didn't stay that way. That's right. &gt;&gt; He came into mind in your heart. And now &gt;&gt; we have the devil's answer. &gt;&gt; You shall hear wars and rumors of wars. I'm not even going to get. So anyway, see that you be not troubled. Now listen. Hold on. Let's go back. This is Jesus talking to his 12 disciples. Judas ain't gonna make it. &gt;&gt; Sorry. Judas ain't gonna make it. But the other 11 are just, you know, when are you coming back? &gt;&gt; All right. When are these things going to happen? What's a sign of the end? &gt;&gt; He answered all three. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Then he comes back. Death, burial, resurrection. He comes back and gets ready to ascend. What do they ask him? When are you going to restore Israel? When are you going to do this? When? They understand where he said. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; But it wasn't for them. &gt;&gt; Brother Brown says it ain't for you. &gt;&gt; It's for another group of people that's coming. &gt;&gt; For a special group of people. &gt;&gt; Praise God. He gave it to us. Come on people. He gave it to us. &gt;&gt; Good Lord. You s watch a stinking football game yesterday watching some of them playoffs and I'm sorry. That's that's one of my weaknesses. But I looked at them. There was one guy, his name was Sterling Sharp. He played football for University of Miami years ago. He's an old man. He acted like a 12-y old. When Miami scored that touchdown, he was I'm going to get in my errand mode now. He was screaming. Got down on his knees and wow, like worshiping. And we go, "Praise the Lord. Got the great Got the greatest message there ever was. Got Jesus in my heart. &gt;&gt; It would change if it was your favorite team. &gt;&gt; But that's what the world does. I mean, &gt;&gt; they go overboard. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But I just want to get in your heart and you live it. Because see, they're going they just live like the devil anyway, but they going to live like the devil tomorrow. And when the ball game's over, they going to go back to living. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But this is eternal. &gt;&gt; This is something you can draw from every day. Everything you need is right here. You just draw from that source. &gt;&gt; So, here's Jesus standing here talking to them. They're asking him the questions and he's telling them the whole answer. And then when they get to the very end over here when he ascends, they ask him about basically the same questions, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; When are you going to take over? When you going to do this, when you going to do that? &gt;&gt; He just shakes his head and goes on into glory. Cuz remember what he said, we won't read it, but where Jesus washes the feet and he says, "Now you'll not understand now, but you will hereafter." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Because there was a lot of things they were going to understand. But now remember, I want you to remember one thing. This message that Jesus preached in Matthew 24 was so special. &gt;&gt; The disciples never preached it. &gt;&gt; That's the opening of the seals. &gt;&gt; They didn't get it. &gt;&gt; And there stood the headstone right there in front of them telling them the who the six are, &gt;&gt; the six seals. And there stood number seven telling them &gt;&gt; where I'm at, what I'm going to do, what the devil's going to do, what I'm going to do. &gt;&gt; And they missed it completely. &gt;&gt; So when brother Ram stood there on the six on the questions and answers, he said, "It's not for you." &gt;&gt; You know why he said it's not for you? It's just the same thing with Jesus standing there telling them all that because brother Ram said, and I've got it on here. We'll read it maybe whatever Sunday we're done coming back here. But he said, Jesus said, he said, "These is what's this is what's going to happen." Brother Ram says, "Okay, this is all this is what's going to happen, &gt;&gt; right?" &gt;&gt; And they're like, "We don't get it. We don't understand." &gt;&gt; But Brother Ram knew that because Brother Ram asked him, he said, I think it was on the fourth seal. He said, "Look, we're going to have we're going to have a prayer line, remember?" He said, "We're going to have questions and answers." He said, "Make it on the I got to read that." So thisten to listen to how this is William Brandham. All right. This is a guy that he's here for a purpose &gt;&gt; to call a group of people. All right. Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; Let me get Let me get down here. Excuse me for a minute. I want to read it while you say it. Okay, right here this the scripture I broke for John 13:7. Jesus answered and said unto them, "What I do, thou knowest not." Now, this is in the foot washing, "But thou shalt know hereafter." Then Peter said, "Thou shalt never wash my feet." Don't ever tell Jesus never &gt;&gt; because he'll embarrass you. But on the fourth seal, now watch he said, "Now in studying this, now don't forget now Sunday or Sunday morning, we omitted the healing service because of having the answers to the people's question." Now watch what he wanted. This is what he wanted. Now I want you to have a question on these seven seals. &gt;&gt; If it's bothering you, something that you don't understand, let's have it on the seven seals. Then I can tell my Saturday night whether it's enough to answer them or not. You see? And then just now, now watch. He tells them, "Do not ask about I had a dream." All right. And then just now say, "Well, about something else or or should I do this or or or my I had a dream." Them them's all worthy things. Now, remember, they're worthy things, but let's stay right with the seven seals. &gt;&gt; That's what we're right on. That's what the meeting is designed to do. The seven seals. Let's stay right with that &gt;&gt; now. The day he had questions and answers, he got two questions on the seals and 26 questions on should women wear pajamas. &gt;&gt; Explain the new birth. Explain father, son, holy ghost is not the right baptism. And of course, he explains them all. But by that time, you know what he says? He read them questions before he came out and that's when he told him. He said, "You're not getting this." &gt;&gt; He said, "It's not for you either." I believe the Lord revealed it to him that it was not for them. &gt;&gt; If not, then that would have been it would have drove me crazy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Knowing that that week was the greatest week of ministry, he said, "I've ever had in my life." &gt;&gt; And nobody understood what he's talking about. &gt;&gt; Jesus standing here, I'm the Messiah. I'm here to save you and I'm here to give you this revelation and you're still wanting to know am I going to destroy Rome? &gt;&gt; That's what they were asking him. &gt;&gt; Remember somebody said, one of the commentators said they wanted Jesus just grab a big sword out and just, you know, chunk all the Romans and throw them out and and then we're back to a millennium. &gt;&gt; No, they just missed the time of the millennium. &gt;&gt; It's later on down the road. But to imagine a man right here, he says, "Then also knowing right among you things are happening. I know you that you don't see it." See, I'm just positive that you don't see it. And you say, "Brother Brown, that's a hard thing for you to say that. I know it is." But look, let me just say this now. I suppose this is just taped for our self and so forth. Thank God it was for us. But let me say this that you don't get it. &gt;&gt; See, and you're not supposed to get it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So don't try to interpret anything. Of course, they didn't listen to that. They tried to interpreted, you know, polygamy and all that other junk as being the seals. &gt;&gt; Don't try to put your interpretation to it. You only get further away. Take my advice. If you believe in me now, if God has given me favor in your sight and you know that them revelations and things, I've been here with you a long time and it's going and it's always been right now to double prove it right hooks right in with the word. See, you know, it's thus sayeth the Lord, it's proved to you. But they didn't know what he was talking about. &gt;&gt; So Jesus is out there preaching his heart out. Nobody understood what he was saying. &gt;&gt; When are you going to restore Israel? When are you going to do this? When are you going to do that? You know, and and We look at what brother Brandon went through. We look what Jesus went through. I want us not to go through that here &gt;&gt; all over the whole bride of Jesus Christ. We got to get this or we don't make it to the body change. &gt;&gt; Somebody's got to get it &gt;&gt; because it's been spoke. &gt;&gt; Somebody will. &gt;&gt; But remember, Judas was among that group. and stayed there until the crucifixion &gt;&gt; right up to the time because remember you hung yourself and then Jesus got put on the cross right &gt;&gt; that's how close it is he was sitting right there eating the same food I'm talking about everything everything he ate was right there with them he was among them and he deceived every one of them but the son of man we're going to stop right here cuz it's it's hot up here, too. It's just 70°. Boy, if I was jumping around for my favorite team, I'd probably be sweating all over the place. This is my favorite team. &gt;&gt; And I am sweating a little bit. So, we look, but we'll close right here. I We'll get started somewhere else. We're just on the red horse. But each one of these horses are a symbol of a power &gt;&gt; that Satan is using. Okay. &gt;&gt; Red or white, red, black, and pale. Now, what is a pale horse? It's all three of these wrapped up together. &gt;&gt; If you'll do that sometime, take white paint, red paint, and black paint, put it in a bucket, and stir it up. It's the most putrid, ugly looking color you'll ever see in your life. But that's what the pale horse is in this day and age right here. It's all culminating into one. &gt;&gt; Well, let me tell you something else. There's a church. There's a bride that has a real white horse. &gt;&gt; It's called justification. &gt;&gt; We have a real red horse, which is sanctification. &gt;&gt; We have a real black horse. You say that's bad. No, it ain't. Cuz you got to die. &gt;&gt; You got to die. The Holy Ghost, you got to die. Or if you ain't dead, then who's alive? Come on. &gt;&gt; And then what? The fourth thing is all that wrapped up into one and we get out of here. &gt;&gt; Cuz remember the rapture takes place on the fourth seal. &gt;&gt; And we'll explain all that. But re remember if brother Brandham can tell us, we ought to be able to preach it. &gt;&gt; I believe the seals are open. I believe that we can read the book just like brother Brandham did the Bible. &gt;&gt; And then we can take the prophet's message and we can mesh them together &gt;&gt; because that's what Jesus did. Now remember though, Jesus preached the seals in a symbol form and he was pointing towards something &gt;&gt; cuz I I don't have it in here, but remember after he got finished with the sixth seal, he stopped and he said, "Now let's look at the fig tree." &gt;&gt; Cuz remember, six seals finish his redemption. The seventh is his coming. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He was standing there already on earth. He went through all these and the last thing he said, he said, "Oh, oh, there's a parable of a fig tree &gt;&gt; that we need to talk about." &gt;&gt; So, he diverted every bit of that back to Israel. Well, guess what we're doing when we get finished here? Not here, not here physically. When we get finished in the Revelation, this all is going to Israel &gt;&gt; to two prophets. No Gentiles are going over there. Sorry about that. I was uh listening coming back from Kentucky the other day where brother Brandham uh he was preaching. He said, "Oh," he said, "That's my ministry." You know, he went to Egypt, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He thought he was going to take them out. If he would have done that, he'd have broke every scripture in the Bible &gt;&gt; and there would have been a a rapture of a bunch of Jews, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And I don't mean that bad, but there'd be a rapture of them and not us &gt;&gt; because a prophet goes to them. They'll believe the prophet if he' went over there. Yeah. They'd have believed it because when Moses and Elijah goes over there in type or in spirit, they going to believe them. It's only going to take them three and a half years. It's took us 60 &gt;&gt; to figure this thing out. And we ain't got it all figured out yet. &gt;&gt; But in three and a half years, it's going to be like boom boom boom boom boom boom boom. &gt;&gt; But it's Listen, it's this message. It is not a Baptist message, a Pentecostal message. It's this message right here. Amen. &gt;&gt; This message through two prophets revealing Jesus Christ to a bunch of people that didn't care about him to begin with. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They still looking for him, folks. &gt;&gt; They're still looking for Christ. &gt;&gt; That's why they're going to say, "Oops, we're in trouble. &gt;&gt; He's already We're looking for him. He's already come. He's already been through seven church ages. He's already been through a prophet in the end time, our Elijah." All right. &gt;&gt; And they're looking for their Elijah. &gt;&gt; And he'll come. &gt;&gt; No doubt. &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. He'll come. But it will come from this message right here. And it will come to them no sooner it will be when we are ready and take a rapture. &gt;&gt; He will not deal with the Jews until you and I are out of here. Joseph sent his gentile bride to the palace before he revealed himself to his brothers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So they were in that palace. She was in that palace with the two kids they had. &gt;&gt; And then he comes down and he reveals himself to little Benjamin, which is the type of the what 144,000. Because Benjamin was his brother, &gt;&gt; real brother by blood. The rest of them were concubines and different things, but Joseph and uh and Benjamin were true brothers. So, but Lord, you could you could preach on that a long time, too. But God bless you. &gt;&gt; Appreciate you. Just listen to what don't listen to me. I said a long time ago, I wish to God that you could put a screen across or or a curtain across here and just listen to the voice of the person. &gt;&gt; Not look at the humanity and look at the how I do things and how I look and how I act. Just listen to the words. Just listen to the voice of God talking to you. &gt;&gt; Now, if you'll do that, then you'll shed all that other stuff &gt;&gt; and God will really be able to speak to you. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord, &gt;&gt; then you got to love me &gt;&gt; cuz he's inside of me, too. &gt;&gt; You might not like my quirks every once in a while, but Brother Gabriel does. He likes me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Maybe his wife. Jury's out, but maybe Sister Rebecca. Lord, I've known him since they were all little. Little little kids. She Now they got Now they got big kids. Thomas Shorty. &gt;&gt; It's good to see these kids come up. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's good to see them come up and and be around, sing, &gt;&gt; worship, &gt;&gt; be in service, &gt;&gt; and grow up like them. We're baby babies. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you know what? Until the Lord comes, we're just going to keep carrying on. &gt;&gt; Okay? We're going to keep going on. We're going to keep trying our best. We're going to keep trying. We're going to keep trying to number one expose the devil. &gt;&gt; Expose him for what he is &gt;&gt; and then what? Then put Jesus Christ in the forefront because a lot of times we don't. A lot of times we put Come on. &gt;&gt; We get in the way a lot. Well, is it us or is it the devil? The devil knows if he can get you to re to believe him, &gt;&gt; he's got you. That's right. &gt;&gt; But somewhere in there, there's got to be something inside of you. Like brother Ram said, he said, "The devil told me the truth." &gt;&gt; Remember when the devil told him in his ear, he said, "Your baby's dying. Your wife's dying. Dead. Your baby's dying. What are you going to do?" He said, "I almost listened to what he said." &gt;&gt; He was a prophet. You would have thought there was angels hovered over brother Brana, but no, he was a human &gt;&gt; in a situation as Job. And then Satan couldn't understand when when when brother Ram just looked over to the side and he said, "Though God slay me, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; yet I'll trust him." &gt;&gt; The Lord giveth, the Lord taketh away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we've got to be. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Every trial we go through, &gt;&gt; it's the Lord. If you're a child of his, why will he give you a stone if you ask for bread? Why will he give you a scorpion if you ask for other something else? He can't do that. He'll let you go through things, but remember, they're light afflictions. &gt;&gt; We're trying to escape a place that's going to be horrible. &gt;&gt; Horrible. You'll never know. And I hope you don't ever know. &gt;&gt; If you're a bride of Jesus Christ, you will never know. Amen. &gt;&gt; The torment that's going to be. &gt;&gt; And then one day, I like what Kirk Cameron said. Finally, he's he isn't standing up. I mean, he they keep bashing him inside the head, but he's like, "No." He said, "You ain't going to burn eternally." He said, "You going to burn up one day, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And that's what you'll do. Think about it. You exist as a human being right now. All of you, we're all human beings. We all have family, past, we all have &gt;&gt; memories. one day if you're not born again, you just disappear, &gt;&gt; like you never was to begin with. &gt;&gt; To me, that's horrible &gt;&gt; because the bride now, we ain't going to remember the real bad things, but we're going to remember the things that we were down here. We're going to remember that we were human beings. We're going to remember we went through trials and tribulations because that's that's our testimony, right? Because the angels, they're just going to stand there and go, "I don't know what you're going through. I never was that way. And you say, and you say, "Oh, man. If it hadn't been for that guy right over there on that throne, &gt;&gt; if it hadn't been for him, I'd have never made it." &gt;&gt; Put your eyes on Jesus, &gt;&gt; not on another man. &gt;&gt; Let's sing a song. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Redeemed from every imit constantly within. Make the consecration trust in God and then let the Holy Ghost come in. Sing it to him. Oh, let the Holy Ghost come in.

Make the consecration. Trust in God and me. Let the Holy Ghost come in. Oh, let the Holy Ghost come in. Let the Holy Ghost come in. Make the consecration. Trust in God and then let the Holy Ghost come in. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a simple thing, you know, he's he's wanting to knock on the door. He knocks. All you got to do is open the door. I like that uh message brother Vine preached without money and without price. What a powerful message that this world and I'm not I'm not belittling anyone that likes to make money cuz money in your pocket makes you feel better. Okay? But when we make it our God and we build up a kingdom here and we let our kingdom in heaven starve &gt;&gt; or go bankrupt. But there's no price. There's no price to this. The only thing we got to do is just yield to him and live. He's already wrote the pres. Listen, prescriptions written and and brothers and sisters, he can't change this. So, he's not going to in the middle of a in the middle of a trial, he's going to go, "No, I don't. No, don't trust this. I'm going to give you another." No, he's got this right here. &gt;&gt; This is it. &gt;&gt; This is the thing we need. And then when we have this, Brother Manuel, when we have this, it'll point us to the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; And then we'll have more clarity and we'll have the between the lines that Jesus was telling. Cuz remember, he I'm going to start preaching again. He was preaching the seals to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was my whole point. He wasn't preaching it to them. Brother Brandham wasn't preaching the seals to those people sitting in that auditorium. He was preaching them to us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Cuz he didn't say now nobody's ever going to get it. No, he said you're not going to get it &gt;&gt; and you're not supposed to get it, but there's a group that'll get it. &gt;&gt; Jesus has got more patience than we do cuz he knew they weren't going to get it. He's going to have to die though so they could try to get it. &gt;&gt; And we have to die out to oursel so that we can get it. That's all we got to do. Die it to oursel and we can get it. If we put self in the way, we always fail. &gt;&gt; Don't ever say, "I did something." No, you say Lord willing I'll do this or the Lord did this for me or the Lord even in a trial say the Lord just did this for me. Hey, listen. Remember brother Louise and Sister Christine and the girls maybe they'll quit traveling one day and but but Sister Christine's going to see her family and we sure we sure love her family and appreciate them and uh we appreciate them letting her go come back. Same way with Joe and and Rachel. They're on their way to New Mexico to her family. So, if we can get all them people to move out here like somebody else is Hello, somebody. I need to stop before I start saying anything again. I guess I'll just I guess not. It's in my heart. I love family. Y'all know we we love family &gt;&gt; and I love my church family. I love to be around believers. Why would you want to be around a bunch of drunks? And I don't feel comfortable.
