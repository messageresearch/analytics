you're not if you're not in you're out right amen was a time when Noah preached 120 years we've had 60 years since the prophet left what have we done with it come on we still standing outside the ark thinking we might need to get in come on now remember Noah didn't shut the door NOP God shut the door that's right God going to shut this door you're going to be able to get in that's right right I've said many times that thing was pitched inside and out with tar I'll promise you one thing there was a lot of fingernail marks when that water started Rising right yes well Albert it was a lot of people trying to get in that Ark there was a lot of people trying to grab a hole but they couldn't they had their time we've had our time sure we've had a wonderful time this weekend now we come to the park where we to hear the word of God and we should appreciate each every one of you Iran Full Gospel Tabernacle you showed out this weekend you brought a crew when you fed us and you've been just accommodated so very well we've had more than we did last year and if the Lord willing next year brother Andre permit us we'll do this again so just get ready we're coming back well praise the Lord amen I'll say it anyway praise the Lord prise the Lord but thank you thank you for your fellowship thank you uh for my church um for uh coming up here and and being a part of this and being a part of the uh the fellowship a lot of you that are younger do not know that we used to come up here a lot when I was a little boy young man we used to come up here and and we with Fellowship time happened things happened we kind of got apart but now we've come full circle back together praise the Lord and I believe that this is the this is what we're supposed to do as I was telling you last night the Lord Jesus said to hate your enemy no he didn't say that he said love your enemy amen he said pray for those that despitefully use you well brother that's hard for me to do well Jesus told us to do maybe if we'll start doing that then we'll get all these other things straighten out amen amen draw the circle bigger is brother R said that's right hey praise the Lord we're to have Fellowship one with another so next year if the Lord carries we will continue to do this this time of the year so just keep that on your calendar Max loo said forgive and give as if it were your last opportunity love like there's no tomorrow and if Tomorrow Comes Love Again amen love conquers all things amen that's right love conquers everything true right you say well brother I love you well that's okay you get the new birth you'll learn to love me a lot more cuz without the new birth you do not know how to love that's right we're going to read it right here in just a few minutes you turn to the Book of James we're going to talk a minute just a little thought we're going to talk about the seals uh in in a simple form where maybe you'll be able to see it um brothers and sisters we are sealed people amen that's what our final voice to the final age is is those seven last seals amen it was sealed up to everyone it was seal SE up to the world it was sealed up to the denominations and without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can't see them either amen amen see means to what understand right we can see them we can read them brother R preached them in 1963 amen amen 1963 this is 2024 I believe sometime we shut the book back I thought we were open book people right sometimes I look around and I think man they're shutting the book more than they're opening it but the true bride remember if you looked at Israel one day and you looked at them and you thought man they are a awful bunch of people if that's God's people I don't know they were looking at the mix multitude they were not looking at the true bride the true bride is moving on the true bride is not Wy Wy Woo is brother corny always says she's moving forward right she's ready to get out of here she wants to word of God more than anything in the world Amen so I love you with the love of the Lord and I appreciate you and thank you for giving us an opportunity to come and to be here and and uh sister Dorothy never thought in my life I'd stand behind this pulet I sat out there a lot but I never figured I'd be back here so God's Providence has give us an opportunity to do that and we sure appreciate the Lord giving us help to to stay with brother Andre and and and become really good friends in the past year or so and we continue to do that and we appreciate him as a pastor here he has done a wonderful job we sure appreciate just stand behind him amen where's brother Aaron is it your time to preach I got to make an announcement for our church you got to it's your turn to do Wednesday night I think L was laughing you okay you're preaching Wednesday night aren't you not here aren't you I got to make these announcements before we get to uh before we get out of here and get separated but uh like I said again than thank you so much for having us here we appreciate you we love you turn to the Book of James and what we're going to do do today is we're going to look at a progression this message is a progressive message that's right it is a message that moves forward God never stands still amen that's why you see the folks in Israel at the Wailing Wall that's why they're moving like this because God is a moving God Amen they're moving because they know that the word of God is alive and that it's moving but praise God we ought to know where it that mhm not in a wall not in a book not over in Jerusalem there's an empty tomb over there because he's inside of you today right amen do you love the Lord amen let's bow our heads dear heavenly father thank you for the day you give us thank you for the purchase of your blood father this is the group of people Lord that's going to see all these things come to pass father I pray that you'd be with us now you be the speaker Lord don't be a bystander Lord you be the active participant in this service you take over lord and only you can reveal father only you can give strength and hope only you can give healing father only you can give salvation father all we're doing now is trying to get the scales off of the people dies and the prophet said so that they can see you not me but see you father and what you've done what you did at Calvary you saved us Lord from a from a wretched life of sin and took us and put us in Heavenly places as Paul said and then we're looking forward to getting out of here and going to a place that you prepared for us father thank you so much for the ones that are here today Lord the ones that have put forth an effort this weekend Lord not I'll miss somebody if I name a name but all the ones of the Tabernacle here Lord I pray that You' bless them give them Supernatural strength today and be with each one that and come from Spoken Word Church Lord as we travel back today give us travel in Mercy and just bless us now as we continue on let's just pull back the pages Lord and look look at you for just a moment in Jesus name amen James 1:3 let no man say when he is tempted I am tempted of God for God cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn of his own lust and enticed own lust right God doesn't make you lust no God didn't make you sin no right but he made it situation when you did praise God for that amen verse 15 then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it's finished bringeth forth death amen the Lord has blessing to the read the word hold up hold your Bible up there for just a second then if you want to go ahead and go to Genesis 4 ver1 going to head into the Book of Genesis just for a little bit again thank you for having us we appreciate you we we don't have enough room here I might get building keep coming up now we keep the doors open good to see all y'all on the back can you hear okay okay thumbs up you can hear me anyway praise the Lord am let's look at verse 15 again and let's look at these four things James says when lust is conceived lust is conceived it brings forth sin and sin when it's finished brings forth death amen amen those are those four things now remember all of us sitting in this building was brought forth by that first one sure come on somebody we were cut we were born in sin shed in iniquity lust of our parents brought us here right but look but when it conceived it brought forth sin it brought forth you and me Sinners needing salvation but we come this way because God allowed us to come this way to get us back to the way and we have been there had not been a fall everybody with me that one more time we're coming now by spiritual birth where we were not supposed to come by SE birth we're heading back to that direction to where my father passed away 3 weeks ago and thank you all for your prayers and your and your comments and things that you that you told us this weekend just pray for us all pray for Mom where's mom can on here okay just pray for her she's having a hard time okay she lost her mate um for a long time but but just remembering but but I told him I said I said look I said my dad liveed 84 years some of you that age and older you're heading toward youth yeah you're heading toward what you're supposed to be had that not been a fall my dad is not standing in a body today that was produced by Sam and Peggy Dale I mean Sam and Hannah amen that was the shell that we put in the ground and that was the culmination of the death that's brought forth as death in the natural but praise God 50 or 60 years ago my dad gave his heart to the Lord and he became a new birth it was a new birth started something new that's why I called a new birth cuz your old birth was wrong that's why he told Nicodemus he said Nicodemus you must be born again he said do I have to go back see he right back to that lust part to the sinful part have I got to go back and you know if I was standing there and I know Jesus told him that was not just a conversation that lasted for two uh for two little sentences he said Nicodemus come on that's what killing that's what's killing you sure is that first verse but you must be born from above but we know Nicodemus didn't understand him but we do today we know that there's there's a way to get to God all right and it's through a four-step process in the end time we have as the Bride of Jesus Christ we have got to live this word make it alive bring it off the page stop the quoting with no meaning behind it I didn't say stop the quote I said stop the quote with no meaning behind Jesus said eat my flesh and drink my blood how many of you done that today that's what Jesus told us to do amen a quote from the Bible Y and Jesus is not wrong no he's never made a mistake no but he said eat my flesh and drink my blood now what are we doing we get the Divine interpretation of that he knew that we would in the end time get the Divine interpretation that we needed to be justified that we needed to be Sanctified that we needed to be filled with the Holy Ghost and that the word would come back into Power again or The Headstone or the Capstone whatever you want to call it we are that Apex of people we're not the bottom we're we're going through the church ages at home Martin Luther had justification justification chopped off your past sin but it was his new birth for the time cuz that's all he knew but for me and you just to be justified today that's all right you need to start somewhere cuz remember when lust is conceived it brings forth sin when sin's finished when you come to the end of your life and you're a sinner you're finished you have a white thr judgment and then you're gone right right to scare you but I hope you get scared y yeah I hope God gives you intelligence to realize if you're lost there is a hell there is a judgment and the Bible says if you'll be judged by your work I do not want to ever be judged by my words no as the Bride of Jesus Christ today we are judged by God's work we are judged by what Jesus Christ did and I stand in him the Bible says we stand complet complete in him brother tell us that complete in him and that's why we're looking at these four as brother tells us many times to say reading the quote he said that four death Messengers ate in other words ate the word down but four life Messengers is going to bring it back up and was it going to be through what killed us was a Doctrine yeah yeah Doctrine is what kills you or sustains you one of the two we are Doctrine people brother R said a church without a Doctrine is not a church right so you have a Doctrine here we have a Doctrine at our church there's a doctrine that tells us that we are the Bride of Jesus Christ we are heading to the body change right amen yes y'all need to nod a little louder so I can hear you when lust is conceived it bring forth sin when sin's finished now look we're all born Sinners sure yes okay we were born in lust we were conceived in sin that's right but we don't have to stay that way there's a way out because it says When sin is finished right when it comes to the end of his journey when you come to the end of your journey and they pull the plug in other words you're done right but God gave us four life Messengers to bring it back he gave us four comat Beast the lion the O the man and the eagle he gave us the Holy Ghost amen can discern the good from the bad the false from the TR right amen but are we looking at really a new verse or are we looking at just something that sounds good yeah right I run into people on this message over the years that just is in the message because it's something different Lord have mercy amen something different and then you see them that fall away they have no timeos right Jesus Christ is this message right amen all right amen it come through a prophet amen but it took a five-fold Ministry to break it down to the people that's why brother R's been gone all these years and we're still here amen am weakness in our pit I say I what brother R tell us in marriage and divorce he said the reason we're in this shape is because y'all can't read right it's because you can't go don't go to church the right church what' he say misinterpreted Doctrine or theology from the pull pet somebody told them it was okay to do what they were doing amen well I'm here to tell you it's not okay what we're doing there is a standard we must meet amen but when lust is conceived brings forth sin when sin's finished brings death let's read Daniel 12:4 now we know one thing for sure that the Book of Daniel is the Book of Revelations to the Jews is everybody with me right the Book of Daniel is is is the Book of Revelations to the Jews cuz it tells them where they going it tells them that they have 70 weeks don't run out of the building we're not going to talk on 7 week of Daniel today which in his church it probably wouldn't matter be all right but you can say d in 70 weeks and people go almost like marriage and divorce they go running out the door yeah but there's a there's a designed time for the Jews amen amen time times and dividing of time three and A2 years they're going to get a Ministry of 1260 days everybody with me you and I don't there's only going to be 144,000 saved right that's why God said that's why brother said watch them that's the time piece right it's time we have no time Mighty Angel the time is no more we we're not in that but we do read the book of Daniel as the Book of Revelation to the Jews but remember by heart you and I are Jewish right amen by heart you and I are Jewish am so we don't just we don't discount all that throw it away no I I love to look at the feast days and all those different things that types what we're doing now in the end so Daniel 12:4 says Daniel shut up the words seal the book until the time of the end we're not in the end time brother Jackie we're in trouble we're deceived we're rolling toward the end real quick sure remember the Bible says the days will be short yep but you better get me AR fooling around quit practicing put practicing going to church on some don't do that anymore but many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased even with the book sealed up hello come on go back again right oh Daniel shut up the words seal the book until the time of the end and many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased now it's not the knowledge of what's in that book because they can't see what's in the book right brother mik right it's hid it's hid from them it's sealed up sir but remember and we know all the symbols and we know what brother Rand did we know that the mighty Angel comes down with the book open we know that I hope you do but we're an open book people but remember what happened and we'll get started here real quick but what happened to that book in Revelations 10 89 John took the open book that's right everybody with me John took that open book and he ate it amen that's right it was open he ate it but what did he do it closed it back up oh wait a minute I got scripture gri not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed sealed until the day of your Redemption amen so it's all sealed back up in a bride nobody's going to be able to understand it but we as a Time as an end time bride it was open we got those seals but once they come inside remember you go into that Holy of holy it's not crowded no it's you and God you're sealed in Satan sealed out some some people are sealed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's good but we want more amen the CES for more because when he ate that open book he can see things right sir remember brother R saw his name right yeah okay maybe you see your name start seeing your name in the book you said well my name's not the book m is is Samuel you got to see you got to see what brother Orman Neville is not the book but what happens during Orman Neville time on Earth is in the book right so you identify listen we identify with all that that's in the book that's happening in the end time now all out there and in here but let's turn to Genesis 4 and when we look at the seal everybody wants to to make it such a mystery and it is because it was closed and now it's open and it's closed back up in us and the world what did Jesus say the world will see me now who's the seal Jesus Christ is the seal all come on but what did he say he said in the end time I'm going to come back but the world's not going to see me anymore he said but you'll see me cuz I'll be with you even what in you to the end of the world Amen that's why we carry God With Us everywhere we go sure if you would think that brother uh Mike hus did a a funeral for brother Barry edin last Monday and we were able to go down and be with him and brother Mike at the end of the service he said you know he said we're all it was you know people there he said everybody here he said Close Your Eyes Of course everybody closed their eyes he said now you're alone with God think about that just by closing your eyes you can close the world out right and be alone with God that's shut in with God in a secret place all you can be in a crowd close your eyes amen you're shut in with God let God speak to you so Genesis 4 we talk about the seals let's go to Genesis 4:1 and we're going to TI a little bit here with the seals we know one thing for sure when when the when the lamb stood on Revelations chap 6 and when he opened the seal now remember who was the lamb Jesus Jesus Christ amen and he had a Doctrine remember brother Brown said Jesus's first Doctrine was what you must be born again so he is the doctrine of Truth so he was standing there brother said here stands a lamb tonight with a book in his hand and there goes the White Horse rid everybody with me right so when you read Revelation 6 it says one of the Beast said come and see and then what happened when he got up there he looked and something went away why did that thing go away why did that horse ride off with that impostor on it cuz he couldn't stand where Christ was right Christ come on the scene the lion of the tribe of Judah there was a Doctrine there that Satan couldn't stand listen you're being killed today by Doctrine or you're being made alive one of the two right and and a Doctrine has to come from somebody's mouth it has to be told by somebody somebody has to start a doctr and somebody has to Quail a Doctrine or or shut one down like we've had many doctrines in the message that that we've all fought against and and they just were false remember one thing anything that doesn't come from God is fault that's right it's pretty simple there's only two powers and Satan is permitted yeah all right there's only one all powerful but he permitted Satan to do these things but you'll read in in Revelation where power was given right power was given for Satan to what do the things that he did amen but so here comes the line of the tribe of Judah and he says John come and see and when he walks up John looks and he sees W horse rider right off what was that that was a Doctrine or the releasing of a Ministry or the releasing of a message right right cuz we're going to look here in a minute Cain's anger really didn't come from Abel be mad at AB it came from his doctrine that he took upon himself and Abel's was different yeah that by with you so now let's look at the seals as the loosing of a Ministry the the loosing of a true Ministry and the loosing of a false Ministry we know that the true Ministry had to be released first come on the true Ministry had to be released first Satan is an impersonator he's an impostor he's not an originator right no God is the originator and then Satan perverts what God brings so God brought a message the lion spoke something wrode off because it couldn't stand it it was a new doctrine that was going out right everybody with so what did he do he went forth conquering and to conquer let's read Genesis 4:1 let's put this in perspective here just for a few minutes and Adam knew knew Eve his wife and she conceived and bear can and said I've gotten a man from the Lord that's their Doctrine hello that was her doctrine that was not Adam's Doctrine right that was Eve do thereby with so there was a Ministry loose right there Satan got into that program come on right everybody with me sure right she again bued his brother Abel and Abel was The Keeper of the sheep but Cain was what till of the ground right I like why brother Joy said one time he said if can't would have just listen to God God didn't curse Adam and Eve God cursed the ground ground so Kain was trying to bring something out of the ground that was already cursed right yeah Abel by Revelation knew that that was what it was and took a lamp but we'll get to that in just a second she buried brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of the sheep but Cain was a tiller of the ground now look at verse three and in the process of time 61 years or so since the prophet left a process of time Cain and Abel grew up now I'll promise you there listen they were only four people on the Earth at the time so the conversation was not to a bunch of people it was to each other our mama or dad everybody with me all right the only couple of people and he was there with his brother and remember Cain was of the wicked one so Cain had a different Spirit but remember Cain before we get any further Cain had a chance to be right amen if not God is Not Just Right God is a just God Amen because if he doesn't give one person chance that one person can stand at the white thr judgment and said you didn't treat me like you did them right and he be Tre but being a just God he said now Abel you're doing right but now Cain if you'll do like your brothers that's what he hated he didn't want that same Doctrine yeah that's why Doctrine what separates us is as as Christian doctrine Doctrine separates us I hope we get over where I don't like brother W till he shout so much well we got a lot of people don't can't hear very well and you need to stay awake right and I can't hear very well either so I have to shout so I can hear my own talk I talk loud for those that don't and can't so in the process of time if you don't like that that's okay you're going to hear it for a little while but remember we have our little quirks but in in Doctrine we should be solid and be the same amen there's only one way one truth one life but we see here in the garden the first thing Satan does is divide but he divides them not because k en able they I'm sure they they hey they grew up together right they grew up together they would they wasn't like I said they wasn't a thousand people and they went off into a different place and now Cain did later on but they were together and they Tau watch and then the process of time that came to pass that came brought her the fruit of the ground an offering to the Lord and watch what happened something Grew From that mhm everybody with me right it didn't just nothing come up so that Kane would know he was wrong right no God had already set forth he said let every seed bring forth of his kind everybody with me if it's watered if it's put in good ground it will come up amen so in the process of time came starts formulating his Doctrine oh yeah I'm okay I can grow this stuff but look look it it must be anointed of God it's coming forth It's Growing I'm getting apples and oranges and peaches and all these different things it must be of God sound like his mama must be of God but he started formulating his Doctrine in other words his Doctrine was cultivated no pun intended yeah cultivated in his heart so he he he then started moving himself away from Abel right cuz remember it's two opposing forces right and that's it but who came now what and Abel verse four he also brought up the first Ling of his flock and of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect into to Abel and to his offering but Cain into his offering he had not respect Cain was very raw his countenance fell yeah you cross somebody on the doct right brother Andre where you at that's right brother amen and countenance fell and the Lord sent her to Cain now listen this didn't come from any other source it came from God himself God talked to Kain and said why AR thou wrong and why is thy countenance Fallen if thou doest well amen shalt thou not be accepted in other words he's presenting to him the correct Doctrine through what Abel did yeah now remember when lust is conceived remember don't get away from that when lust is conceived bring forth sin sin's finished bring forth death all right everybody with me keep that on your on in the back of your mind if thou doest well shall thou not be accepted if thou do is not well sin lies at your door right he was pretty plain about that you don't do what I say you're a sinner sure yeah wow and to thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him so he was given the right Doctrine but in his own lust he wouldn't take it cuz he thought he was right yeah right so now if we look at the seal we see the first seal was what it was a white horse with a rider now remember that white horse was not righteous it looked rightous right yeah amen by I'm going to take my time here for just a minute get this established you go to the first seal a white horse went riding off and even the prophet for a time right people hate this he was deceived right he thought that was a mighty conqueror he thought that was something to do with God because it was white I'm just telling you what he said he said he'd made a horrible mistake if he if he made conqueror again everybody with me but progressive revelation allows us to step up yes sir it allowed him to step up when that seal opened see that's why that seal had to open that's why all the seals had to open so brotherr could bring the true unoperated word of God perfect sure yes he made mistakes but his message is perfect amen right that white horse rider rides off brother said that look like a white righteous church but it wasn't it was Satan yes riding on his Pilot it looked like right right so what happened here when we see the conversation between GL and Kain we see a development of a Doctrine and K gets on that horse yeah right I'm just as good as able you mean you're not going to accept my sacrifice brother Ram even said he come to the point where he said said K said here God take it or leave it right now he's talking right straight to the man ain't going through a filter he's talking right straight to God right he he would not accept correction right he would not accept come on the right Doctrine so he formulated his own and he still seemed righteous he still got that white righteousness in him that's what Rose up righteous indignation rose up and came now watch but now remember when Satan rode that white horse when he got off that white horse the next horse he got on to was what it was a red horse and power was given a sword was given to kill with me you don't know the seals just read the seal book so this red horse he was given a sword so Satan was given power to speak true that's right yep that's right power is given and a was given now remember it wasn't sword sword is a word what is the word word a Doctrine so he was given this Doctrine cuz watch look at verse eight and Cain talked with Abel his brother now they weren't talking about the weather no they weren't talking about what's going on in another country there wasn't one it was pretty obvious Cain and Abel were talking about the differ between their doctr right right everybody with me can't talked with Abel his brother and it came to pass right so it formulated over a period of time the righteous inly nation grew up in Canan Abel was just a humble little sheep hurder you know so it didn't bother him right like a Christian if you're a real true Christian somebody can just rant ra and blow and snot and spew everything else it don't bother you shouldn't that's right you know where you standing so Kan talked with Abel his brother now watch that red horse ride because when they were in the field they got away from M and died they got out in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him right killed him physically killed him got on his red horse yes and started wri he still thinks he's right every brother R said Satan still thinks he's right he's not no listen he's the biggest deceiver in the world but he's the biggest deceived person in the world Amen he thinks he can whip God the very one that created it you see how I think did one time you can't trick or tricker and you can't you can't Bluff Satan cuz he's the biggest Bluff there is you can't Bluff Satan don't even try but Cain talked with Abel his brother and they came to F they were in the field and Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew it red when lust is conceived Satan's lust in Cain brought a conception what brought him and death together or him and the sword together killed able everybody with me today it's boring you you need to hold it up and the Lord said unto Kain where is able thy brother now the Lord comes on the scene he's not worried about he's he's want he's want what he's want to do he on came to do what testify oh yes God knew able was going to die he knew right where the bodies at amen he wanted Cain to testify that's why there'll be a white Throne judgment you're going to have to testify why you turn God down everybody with me there will be why on judgment but praise God I told the church not long ago I said there's two things if you don't get anything about this message get these two things I'm talking about the whole message of the Alum yes two things number one if you're born again and your bride you will never go through the tribulation right praise God for that amen number two you will never have to stand before the white thrown judgment that to me now that's not enough but to me that's enough to bring me to a place to where I want to try my best to miss those two things get born again you automatically miss them amen free ticket to glory amen but you got to get born again F sure right and listen folks just like there was a conception between Cain and Satan to bring forth that what that red horse rider to kill with there's also a conception for me and you amen yes amen absolutely you got to be conceived in the womb here and then here right right we not get to that bless him Lord he said what hast thou done oh wait a minut Cain says I know not he lied to God am I My Brother's Keeper and he said what hast thou done the voice of thy brother's blood cry yes Abel's Doctrine God knew Abel's Doctrine and knew it was right that's right that's what cried abble didn't cry oh no it was the voice of the doctrine that abble had that was the correct Doctrine he heard that because remember Cain didn't that's right K was shut off from that Doctrine right or he would have accepted it the voice of thy brother's blood crith unto me from the ground think about in that fourth Church age during the Dark Ages those Martyrs they may have cried out sure but you know what cried out what was inside of them Father forgive them they don't know what they're doing yes murdered raped y burnt pulled apart just because they were Christian and we think we have problems just like it does I'm sorry I can't go Church got diarrhea I'm a cars out of gas I don't know how that happened I'll promise you you won't miss a doctor's appointment you'll have a gas in the car you'll have your clothes laid out and you'll be there 15 minutes early try that in church sometime you may get better I'm preaching to my church okay all right brother go ahead all right but the voice of those Martyrs cried out so the voice of Abel his Doctrine that's what we're doing today I am voicing a Doctrine today I am crying out hopefully from the Throne of God these things that we need brother Aaron Brother Bob brother Lise brother any other minister that's here that I don't know and brother Andre we're voicing our Doctrine we're we're making it known Amen to the people that's what's going to cry out listen what's going to cry out at today of judgment yeah that's right come on somebody what's going to cry out your life is what's going to cry out and here we are standing and who's going to do the Judgment us that's right because the real voice is CED out here amen yes that's right and you know that's why that one day you may be standing there and one of your sisters probably don't think you're very significant at all probably think you know I'm just I'm just a I'm a woman I can't preach and I praise God I can't you you already be happy that you don't preach sisters you got to pull it at home right amen right but you really significant and I I was thinking about Mary kamani today yesterday um she broke down one of our sisters on the side of the road got come picked her up took her home all the way back come back home charged it for it but took it home but there'll be a day some day of judgment that what's going to cry you're going to cry out one day you going to say there's going to be a gabble that's going to be almost struck and said you're a sinner go to and somebody in the back some little insignificant sister that never done nothing but sit in church and make good cornbread yeah that is a doctor make good cornbread and this for us other people if you don't we need to learn but that voice is going to cry out from that little sister wa 100,000 miles in the back cuz there's going to be millions of R standing there but there's a voice going to come up and say father this person gave me a drink of water this person change my tire on the side of the road your Doctrine is going to cry out and what is it going to do it's going to absolutely cry out so much till it's going to give eternal life to that person stand that was going to hell but because of you and what your Doctrine is it cries out as ael's blood cries out even to this day if you're not born again today Abel's blood is crying out remember he Ty of Christ right right right amen everybody with me right so now let's go to verse 11 for the voice of thy brother's brother Cries Out unto me from the ground now remember what's the third seal the third third seal is a black horse right yes and when that black horse is released there's a doct released everybody with you now we know the first one was white the next one was red this one is black and the last one is what great it's a culmination of all these others right lust is conceived it brings forth sin when sin's finished it brings forth a pay hor yeah it brings forth a doctrine that you and I today are deceived by unless you're born again right amen amen amen that's right so let's go to verse 11 real quick now watch what did God say now look he he gave Abel a chance and gave Kane a chance he even said come on man what have you done the voice of your brother is crying out from the ground can is so hardened so God knows he's not going to repent right verse 11 says now art thou cursed why didn't he say that first he gave him a chance he said now are thou cursed anybody with me right we went through the white we went through the red now we're in the black the Blackness of Cain M yeah listen to this and now art thou cursed from the earth which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand when thou kst the ground it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength now remember they were in the garden of Ed they were in the garden of God they were in the garden that God placed in the East right God planted a garden that's what the Bible you read that yes amen okay Cain was in that Garden that's how close it is came was in that very Garden of Eden and when he was planting potatoes there wasn't any Thorns there wasn't any thisle it all grew just Kim you didn't have to get down and pull the weeds up cuz remember God's getting ready to curse the ground later on right hello amen what am I telling you Cain is sitting here today in this church don't look over preach it bro don't make them mad they'll get mad enough to get born again brother said there were three types of Believers and they I'm just tell you what he said True Believers make Believers and unbelievers right it praise the Lord I'm telling you I I just speak plain I'm sorry we need the new birth amen we need to know the Plan of Salvation we need to know that the plan of God is for us and it's an updated Revelation amen amen Luther's justification will only get you justifi in this period of time it will not give you the new birth but it did give it to Luther because that's all it was required to do listen more is given more is required we are given the open book we are eating the open book we' eat the open book now remember what happened when he eat that book what happened to John it said John now you just go over there and set in the corner and you shut your mouth and don't say nothing he said prophesy Amen to every Kingdom tongue and Nation go talk about this book amen that's open yes sir that's why we're preaching today amen that's right you don't believe in a fivefold Ministry you just can't grow I'm sorry you might get born again under an egg under a um under a dog yeah you know what brother I'm say yeah right but you will not grow you can't press press play can't say it you can't press play and get the full meaning of what this message is that's got to come through a fivefold Ministry to perfect the Saints amen I just bring us here to sit and have a happy time we're good we're good no the baby's really beautiful babies are beautiful the Bible says they're born dead but the babies are beautiful but take that baby and put it in that room and shut the door go back there about 3 months MH you'll find a dead baby that's right of course yeah but what do you do with that baby you feed it you feed it that's right you feed it and you keep feeding it like you some of your teenage boys you never get enough amen that's right knows that with his two that's our heart that's the way we should be in the gospel just for a minute to kind of break everything we should be that way in the gospel that's right we should be hungry for the word of God just like Adam and Levi was hungry to go eat this meal we're fixing to eat over the part car they're already looking at the menu I I hope I hope we look at this menu today amen see that we're giv we give we're giv a seven course meal amen so let's continue just for a second everybody all right amen so we're walking through the the we're we're we know that the the two most wonderful books in the Bible brother R said was what Genesis and Revelation right one tells the beginning one tells the end anybody with me yeah so you ought to be able if the seals are open in the Book of Revelation we ought to be able that to know that they open in the Book of Genesis hello they're opening right now that's right in this in this whole scenario God is opening a Doctrine or a Ministry and so is Satan sure cuz remember Cain's Doctrine it's false and it's continuing to this day right here amen but so is AEL cuz remember Abel passed but Seth was born right right that's right when thou tell us the ground it shall not hence forth yield unto thee her strength a fugitive and a vagabond sht thou be on the earth and Cain said unto the Lord W he Wy W My Punishment is greater than I can bear behold thou Hast driven me out this day from the face of the Earth and from thy face shall I be hid and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that everyone that findeth me shall slay me praise God I hope we we're devil Slayers amen we're demon Slayers we're can Slayers I hope we are sure yes now let's look watch this right here now remember when lust is conceived brings forth sin When sin is finished it brings forth death okay so we're look we're getting ready to look at the finish of the scenario R the pale horse rider now what is the pale horse rider it's all three colors wound into one yes the culmination of the red the white the red and the black swirl together and put in a Pale Horse right putrid color that's the way it is now so now watch and the Lord said unto him verse 15 we're not going to be long bless Lord the Lord said unto him therefore whosoever slayeth Cain Vengeance shall be taken on him Sevenfold now watch and the Lord set a mark yeah upon gain yes lest any find him should kill and what brother R said that was that was the mark of the beast mark of the beast right but he hasn't made his fatal mistake yet can't had made speci mistake yet right the mark of the beast and sealed of God 1961 brother said now we find out that the first marking of a human being started in Genesis Genesis 4:15 God Mark K that's where the first mark of the beast was ever put on was put on Cain he is the beginning of it let's continue on paragraph 25 a mark is a distinction it makes a difference now remember when lust is conceived bring forth sin When sin finished bring forth death yes right uhhuh are the Apex or the culmination so what's it going to culminate in it's going to culminate in a pole starting in a beast right going to end in the Beast every I with me on that starting as the Beast it's going to end as a beast absolutely now we find out look a mark is a distinction paragraph 25 of that same same um a mark is a distinction it makes a difference y it separates something amen but like you say you got one Mark against you a mark but you never said you had one seal against you you got one Mark against you and a seal is a sign of ownership yes amen With Me Seal is a sign that's why the Bible says you're sealed until the day of your Redemption am amen amen but these seals have to open to us to get us to a place to where we can be sealed up yes listen to me just a second you got one Mark against you a seal is a sign of ownership a mark is a distinction and the church is sealed by the Holy Spirit showing ownership hallelujah amen God owns this church amen but the mark of the beast is the Wayward the outcast that refus to take and come God's provided way amen Cain as soon as he was marked went away yeah we got that Abel died and set raised up to take his place with a sign of Resurrection so where was Cain's fatal mistake verse 16 cuz remember God was okay God kept telling him he kept guiding him talking to him talking to him talking to him right right God never said leave my pres that's right that's right told him all these other things what to do how to turn around right he refused it but his fatal mistake and came went out yes from the presence of the Lord that was it you ever leave the presence of the Lord you are Mar that's right that's right and dwelt in the land of n on the east of E brother around in Ephesian Church age 19 well so the church age Ser if you don't believe in the church age book you're lost anyway did you get it now there are those twins again now we talk talk about twins there are those two trees again growing side by side in the same earth right partaking of the same nourishment yes now listen let's go back just a second can't produce fruit right he eat beans and potatoes and carrots and all that stuff now listen abble didn't set up for Hill and just chew on the Lamb's leg no we like a little beans with our meat don't we yes in the natural what I'm telling you is is he ate they both did they both partook of the same nourishment what brother R talking about they both partook of the same nourishment drink the same rain water and benefited by the same Sun yes but they come from different seeds that's right one tree is for the word of God exactly as God give it and loves it and obeys it Hallelujah the other tree is from a seed that's anti- word anti- God and changes it whenever he wants to right wow it substitutes its own Creed and Dogma for the living true word exactly as did Kain who ended up killing Abel but fear not little flock stay with the word keep that word between you and the devil Eve did not do that that's where she fa right amen and when the church lets down on the word she goes into the depths of the darkness of Satan that's right let me read that one more time and when the church lets down on the word she goes into the depth of the darkness of Satan power transformation 1965 brother R said look 150 years ago only travel of man was done was by horse or foot now he goes by jet almost by thought well a right see science has done it and that's of the devil now you say that's right brother yes sir let's take Genesis now verse four we been reading and Cain went out from the presence of the Lord he read that from the Bible now here is his quote for that paragraph 145 now watch the first thing he done you tell me when you think you got enough here cuz I'll just stop he said that what I'm saying it too see he came without from the presence of the Lord there he made his mistake right and there is where you will make a mistake and there's where I'll make a mistake the very minute we walk out of the presence of the Lord Brother that's it cuz we walked out we made a choice that's it God wishes that nobody he didn't wish for Cain to be like he was right can't chose what he was you choose what you are y brother that's right now I promise you one thing you got to crawl over the cross to go to heaven that's right amen amen but now watch we're talking about doct in just for a minute and then we'll finish Cain goes to n right goes out from the presence of God he goes to n with me he marries his half sister everybody with me you say half sister yes because his sister would have been from Eve and Adam Cain was from the Beast and Eve really and Abel weren't Brothers they were half Brothers come they had different right so he took his half sister and he went to out from the presence of God and what happened then he starts having they start having kids and look what his Doctrine produced verse 19 if you still got the scripture there lit was one of his sons yes and lit took unto him two wi his doctr polygamy right right which was listen was permitted by God but that wasn't God's perfect will no cuz look at what the perfect will is now one man one woman that's what it was supposed to be in the garden right so what did he do his Doctrine culminated and even went into his children cuz what he was telling them hey it's okay hey it's all right wear what you want to that's okay come on now God loves you go ahead brother listen I promise you come as you are right shorts bob hair whatever come as you are sit under the fountain you sit under this Fountain long enough and you'll either leave or you'll get born again and you will not leave the place the same way you came listen as Christians today we're not going to leave that place right that door right there without changing some way that's right amen is what brother said do we believe God sent us a prophet well I'm in a good group right he said you either are better or worse when you walk out that door that's right you're worse because you took that doctrine of cane and said that ain't for me right that ain't something I want to do but you got the able group that says whatever Lord I slay a lamb for you Lord slay me put me on the altar amen get rid of the old made yes that's what we need we need to kill it what I tell them when we go baptizing we baptize 20 something people last year or so I said we're going to a killing that's right we're going to a death yes right but praise God Sister Kim we bury him but we raise them back up amen but we are going to it you're going to die one way or the other right right that's it don't I watch just for a second we go through the sea we see 1 through 4 we were just talking about is that right all right just for a second not 12:00 yet I hope that's right right go ahead bro going be L than an hour huh well everybody's hungry all they far they done looking up where farmer's daughter is you know why cuz I did was in there good we're just Home Folks that's right we're just home F and I love you appreciate you bless them Lord so let's look at this real quick just for a minute so if seal 1 23 is four is tight in can and abble I just did it right when lust is conceiv bring forth Sin Sin p and bring forth death the death that Cain was is not the physical dying of Cain it was him walking out of the presence of the war that's right you w out from the presence of the Lord You're Dead that's right cuz remember in the presence of God is life right amen and the presence of God is life away from the presence of God is death right that was K fatal mistake now listen brother Rob could have said I just read you the quote he could have said Kane's fatal mistake was was telling God a lie no I know y'all never lied to God before come on people pray for me sometimes I tell people h i tell tell them stuff like that they're like well maybe I'm the only one I'm preaching to me Dorthy so I maybe I can help myself right Bless but we've all denied God we've all lied to God sure listen if you lie to your Godly parent you're lying to God Bingo oh hello somebody boy that BR it that brought it down to the house you lie to your parents kids and they're Holy Ghost filed You Lie To God so so what I'm saying is that happened to Cain but God didn't say you're done for no it was when Cain made the choice to leave the presence of God absolutely brother Choice can't made the choice to go in another Direction he didn't want to do he didn't even want to stay where God was I was that way when I come here when I was what 10 11 12 well 13 14 years old 15 years old I just warm PE I want to go do something El while you get quiet now but it's the truth but when God struck my soul 20 something years ago it drove me to church it drove me to read the Bible yes brother it didn't drive me away from God it didn't drive me out of the Garden of Eden it drove me back into the Garden of Eden that's right brother what did Brother R tell us he said the three-fold mystery of God was all God was was he poured into who Christ Christ according to what the church take her back to the Garden of Eden yes amen amen all God was you born in Christ all Christ born church church then take her back into the garden of Ed by what by the same Doctrine amen that Abel had it was blood right his blood still cries out every group of Believers yes so see 1 2 3 and 4 we can type those as justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost and the word remember brother R said four death Messengers e remember the the whatever it was wor I can't remember read it he said I will restore promise I'm going to give you back those years that that bug eat down but that was four Life Death Messengers eat it down four life Messengers brought it back amen which was what Luther Wesley Pentecost and here the bride anybody with me amen all right so now we come to a full restoration and remember after the fourth seal the Rapture takes place right am I with Meen read it because brother Rand gets on a fifth Feld he says I don't see any more combat Beast no and the combat Beast is the Holy Ghost the line man an eagle he said I don't see that anymore he said so it must be that the bride has left the Earth yes amen what a revelation amen so what happened when we come to that four seiling when Cain walked out of the presence of the Lord what happened next Seth came forth there was a resurrection that's right that was a resurrection and Seth began to call on the name of the Lord that's what you and I when we have a resurrection from our deadness amen that's it amen Doctrine it produces life there's a resurrection something happen I don't care if it's two fingers sticking up praise God for something amen that's right amen amen now watch that was the four four seal 1 2 3 4 happened right there in the Book of Genesis real quick let's look at what brother rown said about justification sanctification and baptis the Holy Ghost brother said God Justified the world by what the flood yes amen amen washed it with the water now remember sanctification brother R said God came himself in human flesh called Jesus Christ and his blood that's the sanctifying power to the church is the blood that's why the blood C yes amen so sanctification was Jesus's blood at Calvary to cleanse and claim the Earth absolutely and then brother R said the seventh seal was the Holy Ghost himself yes coming on the scene What Not Jesus yeah we know they're the same person come on yes but he's in a different manifestation now amen right he said he said in John 17 he said father I pray that they be one as you and I are one now was he in God too no we were talking about this when we got here Thursday yes sir a lot of people in the message they they they they blast the Oneness they blast the trinitarians which they the biggest Tess ever was that's true brother true Jesus is out there and and I got a piece of him right here no sir St John 17 he said father I pray that they be one amen with me y as you and I are one hallelujah amen bringing it right back amen you're not a you're not you're not a part of God you are God Amen that's right you're part listen Satan the part of God don't get quiet on me he made Lucifer right that's right to be the anointed cherub to do all the singing to do all the praising amen that's right amen Dr you that for a minute cuz remember that if you want to be like God so does Satan that's right there's one thing Satan can't do he can't be God that's right you can amen you can amen cuz he said that amen he said brother L but God he preached a sermon not too long ago but God right who is rich in Mercy but God Who does these things God said We Are One hallelujah amen truly we know that we're not the fullness of the godhead body and individual all right I'm not exuse but now brother rown did tell us and I didn't bring the quote but I got it lay back in in the office brother R said the Bride of Jesus Christ in the end time would be the fullest of the godhead b and a collective group of people amen bringing everything together we are Jesus Christ on the Earth the only God they'll ever see until God comes back in flesh in the Millennium that's right so whose flesh is he using right let me give you a little Point real quick you have a soul you have a spirit you have a body every person in here does yes all right right now your soul is permitted by God when you're a baby born on the Earth God's the only one who can give a soul yeah that's right Satan cannot create Satan cannot give you a soul God has to permit a part of him come on come on right not Eternal but perfect amen with me amen that's why all babies go to heaven that's why brother R was real clear until the Agee of accountability what the blood of Jesus Christ covers you but then there's an account that begins when you start knowing right from wrong there's an account that's being recorded of the things you do and if they stay on that book you're doomed that's right amen that's right right they stay on that book you're Doom right but when you're truly Justified come when you're truly as the flood killed everybody on earth except the people that were in the ark right so you going to have to be dead also amen that's right your soul that nature that's attached to that soul and your Soul's not going to die cuz you're you are a soul right that's right I don't believe in that two Soul doctr where God gives you one Satan gives you one one gets pulled out one gets killed that's too complicated for me amen I just believe that I came here with a sinful nature it was attached to my soul if I keep that I become that yep but one day in 198 1997 I said God I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired I don't want to do this no more amen iin finished with that old me and right then he justified me you know what that book became like this it had bad stuff written on it bad stuff recording Angels don't miss anything that's right you Mom and Daddy M recording Angels do not but one day when I was truly Justified brother Mike that was my account amen that's right but I remember the one that made me do it is still there yes so there's an account started again a recording of my Deeds that's right but if I come to sanctification God cleanse me I wanted to go to church I wanted to read my Bible I wanted to do the things of God what was that doing that was driving that unclean Spirit out right hello what book Luke says that's right now they some of them went willingly I tell them the other day some of them went like this yeah but they got driven out yes and then and I got sealed by the Holy Ghost thank you Lord right so that sealed Christ in sealed Satan now right but we still got a spirit realm where the greatest battle ever fought is right there right amen you said all my flesh my listen folk your flesh ain't nothing but keep your guts in your body that's right that's it uhhuh it keeps you encapsulated it keeps you from falling apart this doesn't sin no no no it's born in sin but this is not sin no what happens inside is sin amen you want to prove that to you Jesus stood one day and the Pharisees said never touched a woman in my life oh never never committ adultery never touched a woman in my life never Jesus looked at and said wrong if you've looked on one that's right but what it wasn't this he went deep than this sure he said if you look on a woman to lust after you've already committed adul with her in your heart amen amen that's pretty simple so don't listen quit blaming your flesh for a lot of things you do your flesh is getting old I know that for a fact but don't blame my flesh for doing anything it's that me that's inside that does it right this just reacts to what's inside it's connected still the justification by the flood Sanic if by Jesus's blood the Holy Ghost himself comes and lives in the person listen to this real quick 1963 brother R said look souls in prison now said those of you that listening on tape I wish you could look at the congregation at this time I hope you're feeling the same way I hope some of you feeling the same way if you're lost today you need the Lord am cuz you're in a can camp right what if it is look at the scripture piled in here could it be is the third pole to preach to the Eternal Doom that's rejected the message of Salvation well you said the church is going yeah they will they'll go right on just the same y amen but remember all this time Noah was in his ark the bride is sealed in with Christ Hallelujah the last member has been redeemed the six seal has produced itself the seventh seal brings him back to Earth yes amen the lamb come and took the book out of the right hand of him and sat down and claimed what he owned yes what he had redeemed amen amen yes we're standing here today right looking at that right there what is the Sixth Seal what is the fifth seal the fifth seal you talking about justification the fifth seal real quick brother Andre already knows this amen watch the fif de it's the soul under the altar crying how long how long to avenge our blood not bride amen that is a group of people that just claimed theel to be the people of God waiting for the Messiah Jews that are killed they don't even love Jesus that's right know did you come on did you no you didn't no of course not you love the world and things of world right that's right amen but one day he justified you Hallelujah if he justified a group of people that hated him come on that's right remember they were given white robes right they were given eternal life MH God Justified them sure did and if he could do that to them in that condition why can't he do it to us in this condition amen that we can realize that our old man's gone that everything we've done in the past oh yeah San's going to bring it up amen but praise God God created a sea yeah right that nobody can touch Satan cannot go into that sea no sir right everybody with me you know what that se is it's the seed of God's forgetful right we can remember it Satan can remember it but God has planted a place to where he can throw your sin come on somebody he throw your sins in that sea and put a no fishing sign on it you bring it up that's your fault that's right we got to start realizing who we are why we're here that we're Justified and those he's Justified he's already glorified he's already give us a new body we just got to walk our way into it we got to eat our way into it thank you Lord everybody with me in sanctification and come on we got to keep being Washed by the Water we got to continue on listen don't stop amen don't stop don't even slow down it's a pull it's a pull it's pulling us somewhere if you're attached to God yes you somewhere look at sanctification when we look at the six seal what is the six seal the six seal is a total Destruction of this world right brother called it the tribulation period yes don't you have one well pray for me here we go again pray for me cuz I have them right but the tribulation period does what it sanctifies the Earth that's right so that God can come back and live on it it will sanctify your Earth if you'll let it do the same thing as brother Joel was talking last night not a firecracker yeah firecrackers no good TNT is no good uh big 50 caliber bomb's not even good brother Brown said the atomic bomb of faith is the only thing that can obliterate and destroy the enemy that's I want to leave you with that that will destroy and then what happens then this Earth come on this Earth and this one yes will be so cleansed that God can come in dwell in us the way he wanted to am but he'll also be able to put his feet on the ground that six seal sanctification of the bombs and everything going off and wiping everything off of the earth then God puts his feet down yes he takes back possession amen take back possession Satan had you at one time but God said they're mine they're my people now they're my bride that's right they're the ones that I love and you know what we love anybody let's stand up for you right we love him back we thank God for what he did for us yes Lord we thank God he sent us the word of God so that we can look at the seals not just in the Book of Revelations but you can type it all the way through the Book of Genesis CU you see that white horse rider riding all the way through there you you never looked at Nebuchadnezzar and all those different ones uh then you go down and you look at all these different ones down Through the Ages down in that tried to be like God balum bam white horse rider were riding right through him everybody thought he was a great prophet he was until he crossed God yeah you know what he was a good Prophet until he cross God's people am come on Brother come on mus we'll sing some real quick God bless you we love you with the love of the Lord thank you for for listening maybe that'll help us to realize that the the seals we know are open but they're closed up inside of you and only you and God can talk about that right you and God are the only two alone in inside of you oh sure the Satan does Satan does get into your brand once in a while but remember the old story that brother R told about the Indian now remember Indian didn't have a problem before he was born again M righten he said since me born again I have white dog black dog amen there becomes a war there what between your carnality your spirit realm memory reason conscious faction imagination and God amen amen oh I am blessed I am blessed I am every day that I I am bless are you blessed we're blessed group of people this is the word of God to the Earth the last one final one you find something different better please let me know it ain't I am I am I [Music] am every day I I am when I W up in the morning I my hand to I am blessed I am blessed and I have for my I have to brothers and sisters all they are my I am I am blessed every that I I am bless i w up in the morning I I amess I amess amen are you blessed this morning amen Jesus said this blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness shall be F amen to have that desire to hear what we heard this morning progression of the word we're thankful that the Incarnate Word the seed word that was quickened and planted by the son of man Christ the son amen that seed word that has grown in Us in the mess Feast of the trumpets brother Brown says Children of the light just keep walking and watch it unfold we're thankful as we see because we're not that other side and I pray as our brother made it so eloquent and so clear I pray that the word of God that's drawing us that's transforming us that's making us into His Image I trust that when that word comes by that we don't put our own intellect or our own idea and say well I'm just as good or I don't need that we don't want to do that right Jesus said if anyone take away add to the word then the plagues of this book shall be added I'm thankful for the justification and sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost under MDC amen as the Apostle Paul said in second Corinthians we desire to be clothed from our house that is from Heaven as our precious brother preaching that word and showing us the wisdom the discernment of the son Sons and Daughters of God knowing their position and knowing the hour that we're in oh thank you so much brother brother Wade we thank brother the Lord for using Brother Wade in such a way if there is scripture today you would have to deny the scriptures he read from the scriptures laid them there in Genesis and the two books that sat I'm not going to preach the two books that sat from Genesis and revelation he showed us that showed us the scripture showed us the progression of Satan sin and death and lust y I'm thankful that we are not in that progression right but in the progression of the word as Jesus the Bible says he grew in Grace and knowledge and Peter says in second Peter 3:18 grow in the grace and knowledge that the eyes of your understand understanding Paul says might be open and the spirit of wisdom and spirit of Revelation that we might know the hope of his calling and who we are and God's inheritance in the Saints thankful there's a people here that know who they are know they come from God I know that these things that we're seeing today these modern events made clear by prophecy Israel in their in their land not just in their land but crying out because God has permitted these things when we see the Hamas and the hoopies and hot there and Ira Iran and Rush all these things we can't just look at God's time piece and think there's not something there some climax come life is more than eating three meals a day and putting on some clothes Jesus said I come that they may have life amen the Abundant Life Satan comes to kill Ste and destroy so on what brother Wade said if you look in the mirror of God's word are you continuing to walk in that word is there a real pull in your heart to say I want more of God we don't have no church program this is the program of God it's not some man program trying to lift up some man so somebody say well that you know it's the word that's being Jesus said why be lifted up draw to me thankful we are so you got to look in your own life don't matter what church you go to these churches we got plenty of here in earth when you like to take something back with you take them many people that's as far as they go that's right buddy brother said don't stop at the church go all the way to Jesus Christ so we thank you and again we want to thank everyone you Georgia people for you know I'm from originally Mar but

once again your lives each one of you is precious amen it's precious I remember this morning just an hour or so ago when I was watching the different one scene I thought Lord we we've got a bouquet here God's Great bouquet amen and it just shows you when we look at each one of you as brother Brian says God is a god of variety what who does want to live with this God there there has to come a time though when when the preached word becomes the lived word becomes becomes flesh and begin that's you and so we're so thankful to God for you all coming up I saw my father in The Gospel or dad in

Irwin I thank God for them time that I learned from Brother Woodby and those years but here we are in 2024 growing in the grace and knowing who we are and seeing the word made manifest I'm not looking at a man I'm looking at the reveal word for this hour God knows for M it is the reveal word and so when I see you all and I've been knowing you all you've been knowing me over the years and we see each other to encourage one another we want to encourage our young people let them know that they are blessed and this age that Satan is trying to destroy the identification of our young people and old people and whoever is trying to tell us that we're not who we are he's trying to put his identification on you and and all this all this wicked perversion in this Le AG I'm thankful that we know who we are and where we come from I'm thankful that we don't have to be some siss weak pits that afraid to tell the truth or some me money women in popularity I'm thankful that there's genuine ministers like brother way men that don't just try to pick up a text and preach but men that are dedicated I was telling brother black I really appreciate him brother Aon there brother Lis there these men have been a blessing to this congregation a blessing I was listening other night y y'all permit me to say this I was listening the other night brother uh brother Bob he started talking about joob man I thought praise the Lord I've read Jo ministered on job we talked about job we have a message we brought for the Believers in the church about job there what's the name that message I know and it's a great message you haven't read brother I know and so when I heard him speaking on Joe like I said I began to meditate more and more and just see the word of God grow and so take a hold of these things that God has given us you parents love your children take time you might say well my child is not uh obeying me or they hardheaded so they still each child love claim them and raise them in the admonition of the Lord you I believe in those things I don't believe in just trying to find a thing to preach and all that I've been in the ministry for 27 years years spent 18 years on the mission field with different y momies gaka boy Jas and all over South America why do you say that because there's a real God am that's why I'm say right church folk need to get their lives right religious
