that that song we really appreciate it let's all stand and uh we'll sing word of God ever true as our brother comes this morning you know one of my favorite quotes I heard brother brandham say he said as you receive the word you become the word sounds very simple sometimes but it can be very tough take some dying out to take some Letting Go receiving embracing and believing but it's possible because as his word comes forth this morning say Lord let it be a revelation to me that's what faith is is a revelation to our hearts and I'm thankful for the word of Goden another thing I remember brother uh Billy Paul telling uh what brother bham said it's not in a quote but it was in one of his testimony he said the Bible is the only book in the world that the author is there to reveal it as you read it think about that all the other authors are out out on their yachts and we're paying for their bills and stuff but the Bible is free and he's there to reveal it so wonderful who could think of something like that so as the word come forth he's there just take it receive it say I believe it and he'll Quicken it to you amen holy words long preserve for our walk in this world they ReSound with God's Own Heart oh let the word of God inart words of life and words of hope it gives us strength oh it helps us cold in this world Wherever We Roll the word of God will guide us word of God your true changing me is changing you we have come with Open Hearts oh let the word of God part holy words of our handed down to the came to through sacrifice oh aren't you glad they sacrifice their life sometime to get this message here holy words long preserve for our war in this world they ReSound with God's heart word god sing it the word of God is ever true changing it'll never change we change but it'll never change we have come with open heart oh let the word of God [Music] amen God bless you good to be in the house of the Lord good to be back in the country Brother Louis and I and sister

15th and 16th or 15th and 16th cuz brother brother be on the 16th what we're going to do is I've been talking to brother Joe Canada for about a couple of months what we're going to do in February February is usually a bleak month and you don't do anything and you're not on vacation and I'm not ever going to say this before but I'm glad about 20 of us are not here today cuz we'd have to put out chairs but we got a bunch of people that are on vacation still and not back pray for brother Aaron he had to go in early this morning he was supposed to be leading singing he had to work and then my sister and uh Richard are are gone and and several ones the TS so we just pray that get them back home get these uh get these holidays over with and get everybody back so usually in February nobody takes a vacation so what we're going to do is this the Sunday that we have only one service now so after that service every weekend in February every Sunday after service we're going to have either uh a sewing class for the Sisters a canning class cooking class for the brothers praise the Lord some need it bad uh we're going to uh look into doing some if anybody wants to learn how to shoot archery or um a shooting uh we're going to take some time we're not going to shoot in the church I'll do that from here and everybody says amen so anyway we're going to go down to the go down to my house I have a shooting there and we can go down there and learn how to I have a friend of mine Mike Queen and he's a certified instructor we get him to come and uh teach us how to uh shoot a firearm and then uh also um we thought about having this several years ago and we kind of dropped it but we're going to have a computer class one Sunday afternoon we'll schedule this and let you know that where brother Joe and some of the techie guys are going to tell us how to use the table how to to use the folio views I only know a couple of moves and that's about it I'd like to learn some of the other stuff so we'll have that and it's all whatever you want to do you don't have to do it or you can if you want to and then also I was talking to brother Luis while we were over in Honduras we may have a simple Spanish class one Sunday afternoon all get together and just learn how to speak English now we're going to have to learn French oh sister come on you can yeah now got to Le I speak French so uh maybe uh maybe um a brother and sister back there can help us brother ebenezar and but the sewing class has already started I want y'all to know the past two days I had seen my wife she's been at somebody's house sewing teaching her how to sew I don't know who that is but her husband's laughing and standing right beside of him so that's already started but uh uh you know what if we're we believe the Lord can come anytime you know that and we're serious about that but if we have to live life I want us to live it good I want us to be able to function as a church and as an individuals and learning how to sew if you'll learn how to sew you won't bring it to my wife to sew so it's very simple and it's easy to do canning is good mom learn knows how to can June does several but several don't we've got some young sisters that are coming up that uh if you start looking for husbands your resume now is going to have to be canning cooking sewing probably shooting an archery too and a foreign language so the Lord bless you let's turn into Bibles to uh like I said we we love the Lord and we love we love people we love all of you let's go to the Book of Psalms what we're going to do today is we've been speaking for those of you that are that are new we've been speaking for now a year on the son of man Ministry and now we've come into the transition from from as we say from brother brandham and his healing campaign into the opening of the word which is the seals and the different things and the mysteries of God we believe in the Mysteries we believe if the book's open we can read it if brother Brown preached it so can we that's what he did it for he give it to us to preach and to break it down to the people so uh let's turn to the Book of Psalms real quick and then I'll let you be seated dear heavenly father thank you for the day that you give us thank you for each person here Lord I pray that you'd anoint each one of us Lord to hear from you Lord that you would be the active participant in this service Lord you do the speaking Lord may we do the hearing father bless the ones that are sick that are not here Lord we have several that are out sick I pray that you touch their bodies Lord we we have some that are traveling they won't be back for a few days Lord I pray that you'd be with them Lord be with our watch Night Service be with brother Andrew Glover Lord as he comes and ministers for us and then just be with us the rest of this year coming up Lord if you T Lord we'll be here father and if we not we're going to to be home and we'll be just a happy bunch of people so father just be with us now forgive us of our sins and many mistakes Lord in Jesus name we pray amen The Book of Psalms is the words of the Lord are pure words as silver tried in a furnace of Earth now what we're going to do today is purified seven times so we know that number seven is completion and that completes the work we know we're in the seventh Church age all right everybody with me we're in the seventh Church age we've had a seventh angel messenger he's he's brought his message he has went off the scene he did not take the Holy Ghost with him he did not take the word with him he left that for us Amen to be the final voice to the final age verse seven Thou shalt keep them oh Lord Thou shalt preserve them from this generation forever this generation forever Matthew 17 ver9 as they came down from the mountain remember this is a Mount Transfiguration where Jesus was um he Shone like a light and Moses and Elijah showed up and and a voice come and said this is my beloved Son hear ye himm and as they came down from the mountain Jesus charged him saying tell the vision so there was a vision there to no man until until the son of man be risen again from the dead now we know he was killed physically 2,000 years ago but today uh the Lord just impressed on me to go back and read the the message of the indictment and I'm not indicting anybody today brother R's already indicted let the prophet do it but we're going to see how that though transition if we're transitioning to Perfection that had to happen and it had to happen exactly when it happened all right because God doesn't make a mistake and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elias must first come and Jesus said unto them Eli truly shall first come and restore all things now remember John the Baptist did not restore all things so he's talking about another Elijah the next Elijah to come is to restore all things and they didn't understand that so he said okay we're talking about John the Baptist you just do they did to him what they listed they're going to do it to me but I'm going to die on a cross and then what they're going to do in the end time I got to send another Elijah because they're going to crucify me again all right so let's be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now remember Malachi 4 I was telling the the group in Honduras I told him I said you know the love of God I know God loved me because he did something for me brothers and sisters he sent me Elijah the prophet he didn't send him to you don't get quiet he didn't send him to you he send to me behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he's going to do something he didn't just come here and preach and leave he did something we know John the Baptist turned the heart of the fathers which was the fathers in the Old Testament to the new Pentecostal babies when uh the day of Pentecost but from the day of Pentecost until now they have taken and put many denominational ideas they put many Creeds many dogmas and it just eroded the word down it didn't erode the word it was the effect of the word on the people and something had to happen to restore that back because Jesus said they're going to kill me the second time also all right this vision is not going to come until the son of man be risen again in the end time which is now cuz I'll read to you where brother Brown tells us that and why he indicted but now remember God has a perfect timing all right he's always perfect always on time never makes a mistake so and we'll look at it in the sequence of what brother brandham did and how he announced the indictment but we're going to read that one more time that he turned the heart of the children that I'm talking about the soul that's not your thumping gizzard heart as my dad always says it's your soul so he's going to turn our soul back he's going to literally put us in another place that has not been before he going to take the word of God and he's going to restore all things back through even the seals and everything he's going to open up and we're going to have an open book to to learn of the word of God see what God's done and as brother uh Joe was saying the actually the author is the one that's going to teach us how to read the book that he wrote all right that's why I believe with the Holy Ghost in the end time with the Holy Ghost that we have it's not a different Holy Ghost but it's more of it more of it that we're going to know more and have more of the mind of God than ever before because it's a requirement for us to get back to the son of man Ministry which was perfect that Ministry is and was perfect Jesus never made a mistake he never said oops he never said I didn't mean to say that everything he said the father agreed with because he and him were one and then the Holy Ghost is who some other person no the Holy Ghost is not another person it's the same person so he's not going to change his mind when he amorph into the group of people on the day of Pentecost he didn't change his mind his mind still set and Paul picked it up and said we must have that mind to continue on but what happened was in the Dark Ages and all the ages coming up I have to slow down I forget Lis is interpreting in there and listen let me tell you something brother Lise just give him a star while he's here those people in in the in Central America they love that guy they love that guy I mean they love him and U and he does good for him he's just not there he's not a he's not a glamour hog he likes to get in with a group of people and sit there and eat their food and and uh you know be with them and we sure do appreciate having brother Lis with us and uh he interpreted for me so I preach five sermons he preached six he preached One Singular and then five for me so um we sure do appreciate him back there interpreting now so sometimes I forget and take off but I'll slow down a little bit now when brother brandham comes on the scene we were talking about it weeks ago when brother R comes on the scene he had a message to bring but it had a two-fold meaning all right everybody with me had a two-fold meaning cuz he told us in the church age book he said this messenger of Malachi 4 will do two things number one just what I said turn the hearts of the children Babylon Pentecostal children babies back to the original Pentecost a growth development all right but then not stop there to continue on and open up the word where has never been seen before Jesus when he went off the scene he was the seals himself nobody understood him nobody knew who he was when he come back on the day of Pentecost he came back in a form of the Holy Ghost in the people but they didn't have everything they needed for a Rapture because you and I are the ones that's going to get that whole open book for the Rapture of the church everybody with me the opening of the seals the opening all the different different Mysteries of God and I was as I was telling that group over there and they they really rejoiced cuz every service I'd tell them that uh you know um our brother here's new and here in the church and we've been under a Teaching Ministry my dad for 50 years he's been the pastor of the church 40 something years and he passed on to be with the Lord but we had a wonderful Teaching Ministry and we know one thing for sure sometimes we don't understand everything but God said he would give it to us in the time that we needed it all right but you got to make yourself available you can't say I don't know what he's saying and just shut your ears off you got to keep your ears open and listen I told them uh the Hondurans over there I said look as I've told y'all before there's two things there's two Revelations that I got from this message that if I don't get another Revelation this will sustain me to the Rapture number one is I don't have to stand a tribulation period I will not be if I'm born again today I'll never in my life be in a tribulation period everybody else billions of people will go through the tribulation period without the Holy Ghost thank God he sent us a prophet to tell us we didn't have to do that because if you'll talk to baptist you talk to a Methodist you talk to Catholics every one of them's got to go through the tribulation yes right you talk to them and ask them oh yeah we got to we're just not worthy we can't do this well we God sent us a prophet to tell us we are worthy what's already been in the Bible that we're worthy we're white we have no wrinkles we have no spot so we don't have to go through the tribulation and the second thing is we'll never have to stand before the white Throne judgment ever we're going to be in judgment judging but we will never have to stand that horrible place to give an account of what you did yes I don't want to give an account of what I did no I don't want to be judged by my works the Bible says I want to be judged by his works and when I stand before the white Throne I'll be in judgment not judged not judged cuz the Saints will judge the Earth how are we going to judge the Earth cuz we're starting it right now right now we're judging now whether this message is right or wrong we're judging now whether this is right and whether this is wrong we're judging the World by walking into Walmart or different places walk through the country as I was telling the sisters over in Honduras you got to you got something you got a position that's greater even than the men I mean me and brother Donnie we put on regular clothes and we go down through the I mean we're not tatted up and don't have don't have uh earrings where they don't need to be and all kind of things a long hair but really we're just common guys brother Ryan you know you you you meet him on the road I'm a I deliver mail for the Post Office and Ryan drives a chicken truck and kills millions of chickens every day and doesn't care care a thing about it but anyway just money to you right but you see him driving down the road that's not a testimony now we know he is a testimony we know that but a sister just one of you sisters just walk through Walmart you walk into the grocery store you walk anywhere and you're a testimony cuz people now there's a lot of women that people go this and it ain't right but when you they it's a shock factor it's a shock Factor there's a a a a man in our community he's been to church here before and he met us in Walmart one time and I saw him walk by June was standing there and he walked by Roger corn tall guy he walked by and all I saw was he looked back down the aisle again well he came down there and he said God bless you Sister I appreciate you I love seeing somebody um dress Godly and he's a Pentecostal man so see you're there to be the witness for us but remember we're all feminist in the body so we have to contain ourself and be right also men we have to show and project the love of God because we are all feminist in the body of Christ but we are not going to have to go through the tribulation we're not going to have to stand judgment we have passed from Death un life and to me that's two great Revelations that if I don't get another one that's good enough for me that God's preserved me and protect me here I don't care heartaches trials tribulation whatever we go through we got to look at the promise am sir we got to look Abraham looked at the promise he didn't look at the circumstances if we look at the circumstances we're just going to get bogged down with this stinking world that we live in Praise the Lord but God did send us a way out he sent us now we know he sent the Holy Ghost not through brother brandham you should be able to receive the Holy Ghost without knowing who brother random was okay everybody with me he's not your Holy Ghost right he had the Holy Ghost and you got to get your own Holy Ghost and when you get the Holy Ghost as I've said many times before if you get the Holy Ghost you'll not leave this message it'll be so it'll be so much inside of you till it just becomes part of you and there's no way you can leave it CU God can't fight God no but now Satan can fight God and He does by false Doctrine and all the different things but if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul you can't turn God down no you can't turn message down this is a believer's message you become an unbeliever when you can't believe what God sent us in the end time according to the word of God not according to somebody's thought or idea but according to the word of God I see more and more how God sent us something special yes absolutely yes sir but you got to take a hold of it though right you can't just say God sent us somebody and and we appreciate it no you got to live it we got to live the Bible First and when you live the Bible First and you get the true baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul God will bring you up through that statue of perfect man if you'll ask him to do it you got to ask God remember brother Rand says God told us through him that the Holy Ghost is very timid now no one else has ever told us that but the prophet of God said the Holy Ghost is very timid he's not going to jump into your house and start knocking doors down no you're going to invite Men by the new birth but there still going to be doors that that you know like I've said many times before if I was a holy ghost thank God I'm not if I was the Holy Ghost I'd be brother Josie I'd be kicking him Doors Down seeing what's behind it but no God's timid he said if you'll let me in there I'll help you if you don't then I can't help you but thank God he sent us a prophet to tell us that too without a prophet we'd be lost we'd be absolutely lost bunch of people but thank God he did send him to me not you you got to believe that for yourself all right so now brother Ram comes to a time and he starts out and turn to Luke 23:33 and we're transitioning now brother Rand from 1947 to about 1962 we're going to see here in a minute he he's having healing campaigns and he's he's bringing a little bit of the word and he's he's he's uh I don't say he's not compromising at all all but he's not blasting the denomination so much maybe in 59 and and so where he preached why against organized religion but remember when the seals broke he verbatim he said I know now why I hated that thing I know now why I hated that thing why I hated that denomination why he saw the Spirit behind it he saw that writer was that anaca spirit that was in the churches right all right and it could be in this one if we don't drive him out come on somebody listen the devil got here for you did he's sitting right beside you brother Jo you're good there's nobody s beside you but the devil I know okay so so God sent a prophet to do two things remember he's turning us back and then he's going to reveal the seals that's never been revealed before since Jesus left the face of the Earth the seals are going to be open and he says many many times and we'll get into it when we we're going to start in the major Doctrine here in January and and um help us to maybe understand what the third pull is some marriage and divorce and different things that he talked about that have been diluted by the Messengers of the of the U I say preachers in the church so we're going to try to bring it the way that that we see that that God sent us a prophet to give us this he sent him he sent that that man to me to give me this and whatever this is you got to hang on to it all right so he brought it to me so he brought it to me so maybe I can hand it out to you and you can uh you can uh uh use it for your benefit all right but remember in 1962 we see that he preached some of the great messages of spoken words Original Seed uh he preached on um what was it a restoration of the Bride tree and the different things if you're not fam familiar with it go back and look at your dates because dates do mean things all right I'm not much into all that but but God does have a timing you didn't get here until God saw you was going to get here right never before not after he's always on time so in December 1962 brother brandom announces now listen 1962 December all right he announces that he's going to preach an indictment I want to bring the ministers together I didn't bring all the quotes but there's some of them in here we'll read if we have time but he says I'm going to bring this indictment I'm going to get all the ministers together this is not for the sinner see we ought to be sitting here today full of the Holy Ghost and not Sinners and then God can use you a different than he to get you saved is one thing but to get you up that statue of perfect man to get you where he can speak through you is a different story it's a different anointing amen it's not a different Holy Ghost it's a different anointing and brother R even tells us that the Holy Ghost will only work from what you bring him whatever you bring him if you bring him garbage he can't work right but if you bring him the word and you bring him an honest heart and you bring him something that's that's viable I God I'm sorry I I I'm at a place that I don't know where I'm I don't know where I'm good or bad right or wrong I don't know where I'm at my kids are going off here this was going on for there don't worry about that don't worry about that but say God you told me you promised me if I'd open my heart you'd give me something right and you made me a promise as Abraham stood Abram stood many years before he was turned to Abraham he stood many years with one promise you're going to bring a child and what happened was he's just Abram is just like us he tried to figure it out on his own he tried to help God and got a wild child from it give his wife away twice didn't go where he supposed to do God said get up and leave he didn't tell him and lot to get up and leave he told him to get up and leave but the first thing Abram did was he took his friend with him he took lot with him he brought somebody and lot was just the the burden in his bag same way with us we have things that we when God tells us to get up and walk what do we do we leave and want to bring all this stuff with with us that's kind of like justification justification he cleans you up but they still the demon is still there so your lot is still there what he's got to do is is he's got to get to one place to where Abram stood one day and said all right we got to separate which one do you want I'll take the other well in sanctification what happens the unclean Spirit I'm not calling lot an unclean spirit cuz the Bible said he had a righteous soul but I'm telling you that and the analogy is is Abram didn't get blessed until he let to lot left him so your lot whatever your lot is whatever your demon is whatever your your whatever you call whatever you want to it's the devil I told him over there in Honduras I said you got the same demons they just speak English so anyway and French not to leave the French out the French too but we do we have a same demons and they act pretty much the same way okay but he got rid of lot and God started what God started dealing war with Abram he started sanctification process he got the unclean Spirit out and he started same way with us in our journey we get rid of our lot and then we come up to still make mistakes still make mistakes Abram still made mistakes he made a mistake when he was Abraham come on when he got become Abraham that didn't make him God that made God closer to him but he still give his wife away in his new birth so we're still going to have problem now he didn't get to New Birth but the the analogy of of what's going on or the or the allegory that we're trying to prove there with Abram's Journey as he walked he got rid of stuff that's what you and I got to do we got to get rid of stuff Paul even tells us it's that weight that so easily besets us what does it do it hinders hinders our walk keeps us behind right and how do get rid of it is just get rid of it resist the devil and he'll flee from you that's the hardest verse in the whole Bible for us to really really believe is just resis him and he'll flee from you the problem is we entertain him and think that he might flee from us hello somebody amen well pray for me so in December 1962 brother R makes an announcement he said I'm going to get a group together and I'm going to of ministers and I'm going to not talk to Sinners I'm going to indict a generation that's why I read that scripture in Psalms that God would preserve a generation you and I are that last generation I was thinking yesterday when we come to 2025 I know a lot of y'all that's been in the message and us for a long time you'd have never thought 2025 would have ever been a calendar that we had to buy hello but it's here but we're one year closer to the coming of the Lord this thing is shortening down right whether you believe it or not this thing is getting closer and closer and now we see that the world is now lining up Sir the world's getting ready to boil over yes and we're sitting here sometimes on our hands can't get to church can't do this can't do that let every little weight easily beset us we can't do that we got to run this race Paul didn't say walk he said run this race but run it with patience you got to continue on this is not a this is not a microwave religion it's a crock poot religion in other words you turn it on low and you go and you keep going and you keep going and keep going come back you get ready to eat that's the way it's been for these every how many years you've been in the message but there will come a time there is going to come a time that we're going to see as Believers we're going to see the end time we're going to see the culmination of every one of these promises that God's give us you're not going to stop it like brother Brown said you can start tomorrow tonight and you can pray that the sun don't come up tomorrow and I'll promise you according to the word of God about 6:00 in the morning that Sun's going to break up break a horizon because God set it in motion you didn't so brother Ram comes to a time and and he reads this scripture here Luke 23:33 when they were come to the place which is called Calvary There They Crucified him and we know that he took the the the four words and we'll look at them in a minute but he took that and listen to how this listen to how that that God done in December of 1962 he makes that announcement all right in January of 1963 he makes another announcement I'm going to indict this generation I'm going to indict these ministers all right now that's January 1963 now the seals open in March of 1963 everybody with me March the 18th through the 24th is when the seals open at least open to the prophet and then now it's open to us if we'll believe it but now in 1963 he waits until July the 7th 77 1963 and he preaches the indictment he goes to Jeffersonville and he indicts the whole generation for the crucifix second crucifixion of Jesus Christ now how did he do that he did that because of the opening of the seals he didn't do it before he would have done it cuz he said in December I'm going to do it he said in January I'm going to do it he said it's on my heart to do this well he had to wait almost 7 months before God give him the okay to to preach it because now the SE are open he sees where the Antichrist spirit is he knows as those denominations he knows that they're crucifying him again and then he can make that statement I can't do that I can't indict a generation a prophet can only do that CU remember he doesn't reveal anything until he reveals it to the prophet now when he reveals it to the prophet I can read it and we can understand that this transition that brother brandham was looking at he was looking at the people they're not getting it remember I read you sp in um uh what is it the SE um questions and answers on the seal he said you're not getting it it's not for you it's gone from you well now then he just wasted seven day eight days of preaching then if it was to nobody but it was to a group of people that comes to a mature place to where those seals can open and they weren't sitting there there there then they're sitting here now I say this day this scripture is fulfilled in your in your heart and in your ears you can hear this brother Bri said we'll have thus sayith the Lord or sit still well I say according to the word of God thus sayith the Lord we can understand the seals now thus sayith the Lord we can be a bride of Christ that'll take a rapture we can be a group of people that'll even take a body change that your body will absolutely be changed in the moon and twinkling of an eye I don't care how old it is I don't care how young it is all the old people they love that body change the young people as I said I told them over in hondur is the same thing I said when I preach the body change Brothers to to uh you're a little bit older but the some of the young people they go what do you mean body change I don't have no aches and pains and I jump up out of the bed and get my clothes on and I go to work and I work three jobs and come home and then go out and play and all blah blah blah and all us old people are are going even come quickly Lord Jesus cuz we have to get up in shifts we have to get up we tell your feet to get up tell your arms to get up and hope that they get up on the same level that's why brother Donnie every time we do that he says amen being in your 70s it does make a difference cuz I'll be 65 in a few weeks and it's uh it's pretty tough don't laugh brother Jo but it is I mean but we got to all though come to a place to where we we're tired of living here we're tired of going to the doctor we're tired of taking pills to stay alive that's right am I not with somebody today is somebody not we're just tired of this place we love we love our kids and grandkids and and and some of you uh weird people love your job so um other than that it's just getting worse and worse listen it's like brother bobber or brother Aon and said I don't care who you put in the White House it ain't going to get no better nothing's going to get better as far as the world is but praise God the bride's going to get better the bride's not going to fall apart the true bride is going to absolutely stand at the end time and say come on Bring it on Bring it on and God's obligated to bring it to us cuz somebody is going to fulfill the scripture somebody is I'm just dumb enough to believe it's me and you too amen so brother rown tells us in 1963 preaches this message the indictment and we'll talk about that for just a few minutes the word indictment is a formal charge or accusation of a serious crime all right an indictment for conspiracy um or it's I like this a thing that serves to illustrate that a system brother Brandon was looking at a system it wasn't looking at an individuals no he was looking at a system all right a thing that serves to illustrate that a system or situation is bad and deserve to be indicted the example of these rapidly escalating crime figures are an indictment of our society so brother brandom I think he just got to a place to where he took all he's going to take right he and he listen brother I'm never compromised but he did watch what he was doing cuz you watch him when he's preaching several sermons in different places he's careful but once you get up to about 19 right here he ain't careful no more that's right he's bringing it and I you know if you if you watch that movie The or the series The Chosen Jesus has been all nice and kind for about three seasons or two and a half seasons and all of a sudden he looked at him and what'd he say he said his fixing to get rough cuz he' had enough and then you finally see him confronting the the the religion of the day he was confronting them all the time he kind of avoided them at a little while but when you come to the place to where the son of man just gets tired sick and tired of being sick and tired he's going to bring his message now remember when Jesus brought his message that's when people hated him as I was telling him over in in Honduras the world Listen Sinners don't Sinners is not going to they're not your persecution Sinners don't bother me I know who they are they know who they are and they act the way Sinners act but it's when a religious person come on somebody it's when a religious person bring something to you that's totally false well who killed Jesus the Sinners didn't hate him even some of the publicans didn't hate him they believed in who hated him the religious group of the day hated the son of man now if we believe the son of man Ministry is in a group of people today that same Ministry is going to have the same characteristics and it's going to cause the same reaction your worst enemy is going to be supposedly your brother everybody with me right amen if it was then it's got to be now everything if you want to know what the son of man Ministry is read Matthew Bart Luke and John you read Matthew Mark Luke and John there's your son of man Ministry and that's what you and I are under now the son of man Ministry because what happened was is when he indicted this generation in in in July the 7th of 1963 and then on same month in j July the 28th he preaches Christ The Mystery of God revealed one of the greatest sermons he ever preached in his life and he brought the bride together and put the world out come on somebody he brought the bride together he said if you don't get it in this m if you don't get the seals come back and listen to this message right here he said this is the most important message in other words that I've ever preached right here couldn't preach it till after the seals open yeah Hallelujah that's right to tell us where Christ is not where he was where he is Christ is the mystery not was he is the mystery yes amen who is this mzd who is he today he's God in human flesh he's in you and I listen John 1:14 and the Word was made flesh that's happening right now that that that happened 2,000 years ago amen absolutely but now that son of man Ministry that same God is coming into human flesh into me and you and we are the son of man for the end time we are the people of God that's going to manifest Gody so you are John 1:4 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among usj reproach for the cause of the word 1962 now watch here here it is that's in 1962 he begins and he says at Phoenix God willing I h a word the other day I'm going to indict this generation for Killing Jesus Christ pretty harsh cuz you physically he didn't die but they killed his Doctrine crucifying him aresh I'm going to bring an indictment before that Ministerial Association I remember 1962 December God willing they are guilty of the blood of Jesus Christ for crucifying him aresh yes sir indict the whole he didn't leave anybody out Peter indicted them on the day of Pentecost I never thought of this till I read that but Peter did he stood up and indicted them he said you with Wicked hands have crucified the Prince of Life who God raised up we Are Witnesses he brought an indictment I'm going to take the word of God indict every denomination there is and every man on the face of the Earth that's guilty of the blood of Jesus Christ God helped me to be his attorney at that day amen he had to wait seven months he had to wait till the seals open he had to wait till July to do that and then remember he preached There They Crucified him there the most holy place they the most holy people crucified the worst death the king of glory can we do it again they already have any denominational idea we have is killing them aresh right that's right amen you can amen if you want to I don't care it's the truth that's right any denominate any idea away from the word of God is Antichrist any idea that's why we got to be so careful that's got that's why we got to be so precise that's why that sword Cuts real short both ways so let's read now here we are in the indictment now watch in July in Jeffersonville I want to kind of use it more like a courtroom and after all the pull pit in the church is a courtroom the Bible said it's a judgment seat it must begin at the house of the Lord and this is like the throne and the jury and the witnesses and so forth I have today for my witness God's word and my indictment is against the churches of today now I'm not bringing the sinner into this he's just separated right there I'm bringing religious people I'm not bringing the Sinners into this I'm just speaking this to the church church and it being the tapes and I try to get through as quick as I can I indict this generation for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ and now to do this in this age that we live in I do this I must show an Evidence if I have to bring an indictment you have to show an Evidence of the criminal offense that's been done I have to indict them I have to bring the evidence to prove it and it is that what I'm saying will stand up before the main judge look how confident he is cu the seals are open I mean the whole word's there there is no there's nothing compromised there's nothing that he's worried about what I'm saying will stand up before the main judge which I take myself as an attorney to this indictment that the word of God being my witness I indict this generation for the crucifixion now watch I must show and will show that The Same Spirit is on the people today that brought the first crucifixion wow and doing the same thing I must do that it's going to be a crucifixion that they've crucified I must show to the people that the same attitude in the people today now how' you like to be a denominational Minister sitting in that congregation right then and he's talking to you he ain't talking to somebody else he's talking to you I'm going to show the people that same attitude in the people today is doing the same thing spiritually they did physically then now watch it could not have been done a few years ago look how precise God is because we're transitioning to Perfection we had to come through something that was partial to get to Perfection all right so the Perfection was the book's open now and you can call what is is all right it could not have been done a few years ago I say 50 years ago it could not have been done but today this is very timely and it could not have been done maybe 10 years ago but it can be done today because time is running out or run out and we're at the end time they are the greatest religious City they the most religious people crucified the most shameful death him the most precious person if that ain't enough to condemn this generation listen he wasn't condemning Sinners he wasn't condemning prostitutes he was condemning religious people everybody with me I hope I make a point here that's why this transition to Perfection has got to be so real that we transition out of that well that's okay if you do this and well it might be okay if you do that it might be as well I think he meant this and well I think he meant that no no brother knew what God said he knew what God meant he had the love letter in his hand he got the Revelation he got the vision that Jesus said tell that Vision to no one until the son of man be risen again so that vision is now open to me and you that we can look at it and see what he's preached and how to live and how to understand what God's done and how to understand what God Said already not something new we don't bring nothing new they are the most religious organization the biggest of all the churches gathered together in one place they the most religious people of all the races the people who are supposed to be the very worshippers of God they gathered at the greatest holy Feast they got the cleansing of the Passover when they were brought from bondage into Liberty and there in that time they at that time the most religious people in the most religious feast at the most religious place right brought upon the Prince of Life the most shameful thing that could have been done strip a man and hang him on a tree cuz cursed the law said that they worship by cursed is he that hangs on the tree and he was made a curse for us stripped his clothes beat him and mocked him the very God Of Heaven capital punishment brother Brown says now listen he's talking to everybody now watch where you meet is under the shed blood you and I same way today not a thought not an idea not a concept but the very blood of Jesus Christ and even brother Ram tells us in this transformation when he's preaching to us he's telling us that we are now the blood by the spirit the bride is the blood by the spirit amen you are the literal blood listen that's why I just caught that that's why you don't have to stand judgment cuz you're the blood you don't have to stand in Tribulation cuz you're the blood BL if we're the blood by the spirit then we're the only thing that's keeping this world together the blood of Jesus Christ is all over us keeping us it's actually keeping the world from falling apart that's right but there's going to come a time though when they're going to have enough of us just like they did Jesus and they're going to do the same thing they may not kill us physically they may absolutely try their best to break us up move us and try to get us to do things wrong but the bride's got to hold on you and I if we're the bride it's like somebody said long time ago um that the bride's not looking real good well that's not what the Bible say right you're looking at the mixed multitude you're looking at the you're looking at the false prophets you're looking at the uh foolish virgin right the brides always look good listen Jesus wouldn't have married us if we weren't a pretty bride right he knows who we are he knows our potential we just got to open up and use that potential bring that potential to the Forefront so that this year coming up that our maybe our resolution is is to be better Christians closer to God than ever before read the word of God more than we ever read it before pray more than we've ever read it ever prayed before Fellowship more than we ever fellowship before God is a uh God is a bring he brings people together Satan divides Satan always divides he'll get you he'll get the weak one separated over to the side and eat you up but praise God We've Got a Good Shepherd I ain't talking about me I'm talking about we got a real Shepherd that's with you when I'm not that'll bring you back in the fold if you'll just let him amen but now remember that Shepherd hook goes out there pretty quick and drags you in it's not just something where they pat you on the B say come on over here remember he had to break the analogy of one he had to break one of his leg he kept running off and and he had to break his leg to keep it back in the fold sometimes God has to put things on us to keep us in the fall because we're human beings and we're going to be human beings until this thing's over with now he'll not meet just because you're Pentecostal he went through the Methodist he'll meet you under one condition that's under the shed blood when your sins has been confessed and expelled in his presence then by the blood and the blood is always before him and therefore he only can see you through that shed blood and you're white as snow see when you've confessed your sins otherwise you're not there you cannot Fellowship that's the reason that you don't see things happening in the churches they confess that they believe the blood but they reject the very plan to get to the blood which is the word all right there's only one way God will honor that word you'll never honor that word come and say I'm a Roman Catholic I the man this to be done you can't do it Methodist Baptist you can't do it the only way you can do it is under the mercies of God through his grace is to come through the shed blood of Jesus Christ say Lord I claim the promise and then if you really are under that blood watch God is obligated to his word so he's obligated to you he's obligated to his word not anything else but if you put yourself in there he's obligated to help you but first you got to be under the blood all right we don't have to be handshaking like the Baptist join a fellowship like the Methodist speak in tongues like the Pentecostal and whatever you want to say all the other ones is we know that's what brother ROM was saying he said it's the shed blood of Jesus Christ and when you come under that it doesn't divide it brings everything together now sure it divides the sin but it brings us together in Fellowship with each other brotherly kindness is uh hard to do sometimes but God told us we needed to do that that's right need to have brotherly kindness I preached one sermon um that Thursday night at the tent and uh there's a lot of ministers there and probably a lot of different ideas but I preached on a new commandment Jesus said a new commandment I give you that's right not an old one a new one he says love everybody amen love your neighbor as you love yourself do good to those that despitefully use you that don't even feel good does it but that's what Jesus said if you're going to be his disciple you got to pray for those that despitefully use you that's right all it gets quiet but that's okay have you ever tried that though the Bible said if you do it you'll Heap coals on the person that you're praying for you can't do anything about them you can do something about you you can't do anything about them but start loving everybody let's all get to loving everybody and love them with Godly love not this garbage love like the world's got oh I just love you I love to hunt I love to fish I love love is just that word is just horribly used word right even you can't love your wife as much as you love her you can't love her with agape love if you don't have the new birth and she don't have the new birth it's all fil your love it's all love down here on the earth unless you got the agapy love of God you can't love people that's why the Born Again people will and will always love one another it's the mixed multitude that you have to worry about all right now listen just for a second then we'll be done from then on comes the word and the word only from the old Pascal lamb passed away and Christ became our lamb at the day of the crucifixion at the day that the denomination crucified the word of God and accepted a Creed instead of the word that's the day the word came into full effect now look you would think he would say no that deluded the word that made it softer no he said the only time the real word can come into full effect is when they do that when God gives it we go through persecution and we're a child of God it's for our good and I know you hate that but but that's the way it is we're just human beings but if they accept the Creed instead of the word that's the day the word come into full effect that's just been recently all right everybody with me he he's referring to the seals that just was recently and today I indict this bunch of ordained ministers in their Creeds and denominations they are crucifying to the people the very God that they claim they love and serve I indict these ministers in the name of the Lord Jesus upon their doctrine that claim that the days and miracles is passed that water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ is not sufficient and not right upon any of these words that they have substituted Creeds for I indict them as guilty right he's already been judge jury execution he indicted them and then he put them where they supposed to be now watch blood of Jesus Christ is on their hands for crucifying a fresh the Lord Jesus the second time they are crucifying Christ to the public taking from them the thing that they're supposed to be giving to them and they substitute something else in its place a church Creed for popularity the church hated him why he was the very God they hated him and denied him to be their Messiah no sir they didn't want such a messiah as that now listen and today the church does the same thing it denies the word they don't want it it's contradictory to what they've been taught to believe by their Creeds and the word is the Messiah do you believe that yeah congregation says amen well the reflection of the word is what a reflecting of Messiah that's why brother Brown called us little Messiah and I love that he he gave me the title little legal little Messiah he gave me that title I got to learn how to live it right amen which is the Holy Ghost Among Us he is reflecting himself tries to wherever he can find a lamp that he can look through that ain't smoked up with Creeds and things he gives the light through so he's come to a place to where he said look this is that my my Ministry is transitioning from from like I said he never compromise but he would always greet him and say this and say that but he come to a place where that seals those seals opened up he said there's right and wrong right there's white horse black horse red horse gray horse and that's all satan right and then here's the bride over here there's a separation time and that's when he could preach all the other messages I want to read you this then we'll close cut some up short won't be too long today we got visitors here now watch this is another witness but this is in 1958 I want to show this witness and this is really struck home to me reading it the way brother brandham put it out tonight when they just called in bbub he said I'll forgive you for that but when the Holy Ghost has come and does it there'll never be forgiveness for that all right so I say to Jesus after his death bu and Resurrection his power is stronger and more persuading tonight than it was back there in that day so what will she do he talking about the Queen of Sheba so what would she do to this generation we're talking about a generation for this is God's last call sending the Holy Ghost into the church to call his people it's God's last call she wasn't scared she didn't care what the presor was going to say when she got back what the bishop and all them was going to say she stood publicly and she said all that I heard is the truth and more than I heard is the truth can we say that ourself if we heard the truth and more more of the truth than anyone else is in on the face of the earth is come to me and you man you ought to take that we hold dear all kind of stuff we hold de stuff from the past and stuff relics we don't want the kids to break that because grandma gave it to us what about the word of God you do the same thing with it well I'm going to preach anyway cuz we all got to do that we all got to quit looking at relics right and look at the truth the word of God now watch what he says then we'll close she stood publicly she said all that I heard is the truth and more than I heard is the truth she stood for God and she supported the things and she stands today Immortal with the words of Jesus Christ that says when she Rises on the scene in the resurrection her obedience to God will condemn that generation wow for she stood for what was right you know what brother R's talking about the underlying meaning of this whole thing is the denominations are getting ready to cut him off they don't like him anymore they don't like the the he's getting ready to start bringing Doctrine this is 1958 coming up 5960 for she stood for what was right when God sent his gift to the Earth and it was being manifested she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon 1958 have faith in God what will she do when she comes to the Judgment with New England Georgia Lula in the day of judgment when people won't come across the street they won't walk they'll leave their television alone won't leave their television alone long enough to come and see and she to rise up in the judgment and condemn

it let's stand to our feet the queen of the South she was extremely rich she was powerful but the prophet of God said she traveled hundreds of miles there's one quote I didn't ring didn't bring where where brother BR illustrates it as her sitting in his congregation and watching the signs and wonders and watching Solomon with the gift and the gift of discernment course he was talking about himself but he was using that as illustration and that said she sat there and wondered and said she didn't get up and leave and call her State president her and tell them what was going on she sat there and at the end of it you know what she did she supported it she took all the gold all the silver all the every how many 30 camels or every how many loads of of um Treasures she had and she laid them at the feet of Solomon because of the gift that he had she supported it let's support the gift of God you don't have to do it monetarily I'd rather do it prayer do it prayerfully praying praying that the word of God will be more strong this year than never before our kids are growing up they're getting to be adults they going to step out in this world without God I hope not so we're going to pray for them more and more and more God bless you just take these words and listen there was there was a whole generation was indicted by a prophet and that indictment didn't go away it's still happening right now every time the word Goes Forth and somebody turns it down they're being indicted by the word of God not by William brandham by the word of God through a prophet which said I indict this whole generation for the second cre crucifixion to Jesus Christ let's don't crucify him again let's open our heart up and let that Living God live inside of us and then do the works that he told us we could do let's sing a song God bless you if you have a need and I just want to thank you Lord for letting me hear your words what have I done to deserve nothing you did nothing to deserve what God give us but he saw something in you that the world can't even see for that special night he saw you when I saw your with tearful eyes but with joy in your heart face with ET he saw you loving more he saw you open the word and read it more than you've ever read it before not let the world get your way you didn't not let something go on that that don't need to be each one of us get rid of all that

that special night I saw your glorious life came face to face with eternal life most people are never going to get that opportunity I thank the you've heard me tell this story before but I sitting in the getting ready to go on a trip somewhere and uh Atlanta Atlanta Airport's just full of people they just all kind of people it's a Melting Pot and you sat there and as um Sister Christine and brother Lise and I were sitting there you know you you can close your you can close your eyes and you can tell who's late cuz you hear the thing coming down there cuz they're late they pulling their luggage you know trying to get there and then you got the ones L that's like us to get there an hour or so before and we just leisurely sit around and talk and and but I sitting there one day and Lord in Atlanta if you sit there long enough you can see 3 or 4 thousand people in just in one row you know walking through the airport and I said God why did you choose me and not these people why why did you choose me why did you let me hear this why did you let me come to this he spoke to me just as plain as day not an audable voice but inside of me he said you accepted me and they won't that's the difference you accepted me and they won't you know I wondered many many times how that uh God could cut somebody's life shter or let somebody live like Adolf Hitler and different things and do all that and we know it's the grace of God but you know if God knows everything he knew that he give if he give Adolf Hitler a million years to repent he'd never repent he'd never come to that place so he let him do what he did for a purpose and took him off the scene same way with um even young people and and like uh friends and stuff that that God takes off the scene and well you know one thing's for sure if they're not bride they're not going to have to go through the tribulation either so they going to come up to the white Throne judgment and maybe they have to give an account and then we can say that brother was good to me that sister gave me a glass of water that brother changed my tire or that man changed my tire and God's going to look and say all right because of that person you're going to get eternal life that's what eternal life is it's living for others not living for yourself living for others you love the Lord remember Tuesday night 8:00 we'll have a service till midnight
